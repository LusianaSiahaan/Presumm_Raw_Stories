[ 5 ]    Let's Get Started  Welcome to managing Active Directory using PowerShell. There are lot of good  books from Packt Publishing that you might want to refer to improve your  PowerShell skills. Assuming that you know the basics of PowerShell, this book  further helps you to manage Active Directory using PowerShell. Do not worry   if you are not familiar with PowerShell. You can still make use of the content in   this book because most of the one-liners quoted in this book are self-explanatory.  This chapter will take you through some of the essential tools that are required   for managing Active Directory using PowerShell:     The Microsoft Active Directory PowerShell module    The Quest Active Directory PowerShell module    Native PowerShell cmdlets  Details of how to get these tools, install, and configure them are also provided in this  chapter. The content in this book completely relies on these tools to query Active  Directory, so it is important to install and configure them before you proceed with  further chapters in this book.  Though you can install and use these tools on legacy operating systems such  as Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2,  Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and so on, we will focus mostly   on using them on the latest versions of operating systems, such as Windows 8.1   and Windows Server 2012 R2. Most of the operations performed on Windows 8.1  and Windows Server 2012 work on its predecessors. Any noticeable differences   will be highlighted as far as possible.   Another reason for using the latest versions of operating systems for demonstration  is the features list that they provide. When the Microsoft Active Directory  PowerShell module was initially introduced with Windows Server 2008 R2, it came  with 76 cmdlets. In Windows Server 2012, the number of cmdlets increased from  76 to 135. Similarly, the Windows Server 2012 R2 release has 147 Active Directory  cmdlets. Looking at this pattern, it is clear that Microsoft is focusing on bringing  more and more functionality into the Active Directory PowerShell module with its  new releases. This means the types of actions we can perform with the Microsoft  Active Directory module are increasing. Because of these reasons, Windows 8.1 and  Windows Server 2012 R2 are being used for demonstration so that you can learn  more about managing Active Directory using PowerShell.  To see how many cmdlets a module has, use the following commands once you  have the Active Directory PowerShell module installed using the approach that is  discussed later in this chapter:  Import-Module ActiveDirectory  First, import the Active Directory module in a PowerShell window. You will see a  progress bar as shown in the following screenshot:  Once the module is imported, then you can run the following command to verify  how many cmdlets Active Directory module has:   Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory .Count  As you can see in the following screenshot, there are 147 cmdlets available in Active  Directory module on a Windows Server 2012 R2 server:  [ 8 ]   Ways to automate Active Directory  operations Active Directory operations can be automated in different ways. You can use C, VB,  command line tools  such as dsquery , VBScript, PowerShell, Perl, and so on. Since  this book focuses on using PowerShell, let's examine the methodologies that are  widely used to automate Active Directory operations using PowerShell.  There are three ways available to manage Active Directory using PowerShell. Each   of these has its own advantages and operating environments:     The Microsoft Active Directory module    The Quest Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets    The native method of PowerShell  Let's dig into each of these and understand a bit more in terms of how to install,  configure, and use them.  The Microsoft Active Directory module As the name indicates, this PowerShell module is developed and supported by  Microsoft itself. This module contains a group of cmdlets that you can use to manage  Active Directory Domain Services  AD DS  and Active Directory Lightweight  Directory Services  AD LDS . The Microsoft Active Directory module is introduced  with the Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system and you need to have at least this  version of OS to make use of the module. This module comes as an optional feature  on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2  and gets installed by default when you install the AD DS or AD LDS server roles, or  when you promote them as domain controllers. You can have this module installed  on Windows 7 or Windows 8 by installing the Remote Server Administration Tools   RSAT  feature. This module works by querying Active Directory through a service called Active  Directory Web Services  ADWS , which is available in Windows Server 2008 R2 or  later operating systems. This means your domain should have at least one domain  controller with an operating system such as Windows Server 2008 R2 or above to  make the module work.  [ 9 ]   Don't get disappointed if none of your domain controllers are upgraded to Windows  Server 2008 R2. Microsoft has released a component called Active Directory  Management Gateway Service that runs as the Windows Server 2008 R2 ADWS  service and provides the same functionality on Windows Server 2003 or Windows  Server 2008 domain controllers.  You can read more about ADWS and gateway service functionality at   http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library dd391908 v=ws.10 .aspx  Installing Active Directory As mentioned earlier, if you promote a Windows Server 2008 R2 or later operating  system to domain controller, there is no need to install this module explicitly.   It comes with the domain controller installation process.   Installing Active Directory module on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 is  a two-step process. First, we need to install the Remote Server Administration Tool   RSAT  kit for the respective operating system; then we enable the Active Directory  module, which is part of RSAT, as a second step. Installing the Remote Server Administration Tool kit First, download the RSAT package from one of the following links based on your  operating system and install it with administrative privileges:     RSAT for Windows 8.1 http:  www.microsoft.com en-us download      RSAT for Windows 8 http:  www.microsoft.com en-us download   details.aspx?id=39296  details.aspx?id=28972     RSAT for Windows 7 with SP1 http:  www.microsoft.com en-us   download details.aspx?id=7887  Installing the Active Directory module Once the RSAT package is installed, you need to enable Remote Server  Administration Tools  Role Administration Tools  AD DS and AD LDS Tools   Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell via the Turn Windows features  on or off wizard that you will find in the Control Panel of the Windows 7 or   Windows 8 operating systems.  To install Active Directory module on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008  R2, and Windows Server 2012 member servers, there is no need to install additional  components. They are already part of the available features and it's just a matter of  adding the feature to the operating system. This can be done using PowerShell or a  regular GUI approach.  [ 10 ]   If you want to enable this feature using PowerShell in the aforementioned server  operating systems, then use the following commands:  Import-Module ServerManager  Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell  The RSAT package comes with the build on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows  Server 2012. No need to install RSAT explicitly. The Server Manager PowerShell  module in these operating systems contains the cmdlet, Add-WindowsFeature,   which is used for installing features. In this case, we are installing Active Directory  module for the Windows PowerShell feature in the AD DS and AD LDS tools.  If you want to perform this installation on remote servers, you can use the PSRemoting  feature in PowerShell. This is the best approach if you want to deploy Active Directory  module on all your servers in your environment.  This Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell can be installed using GUI  interface as well. You need to use Server Manager to add Active Directory Module  for Windows PowerShell using the Add Roles and Features Wizard as shown in  following screenshot:  [ 11 ]   Testing the functionality After installation, you can verify the functionality of Active Directory module by  importing it and running a few basic cmdlets. A cmdlet is a simple command that is  used in the Windows PowerShell environment. You can read more about cmdlets at  http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library ms714395 v=vs.85 .aspx.  Your installation is successful if you see your domain information after running the  Get-ADDomain cmdlet, as shown in the following:  Import-Module ActiveDirectory  Get-ADDomain  One good thing about PowerShell is you can avoid the hassle of typing the  whole command in the PowerShell window by using the Tab Expansion  feature. You can type part of the command and press the Tab key to  autocomplete it. If there are multiple commands  or cmdlets  that match  the string you typed, then use Tab multiple times to select the one you  need. It's pretty handy because some of the cmdlets in Active Directory  are considerably long and it can get really frustrating to type them. Refer  to the TechNet page at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us  library dd315316.aspx in order to understand how you can use this  feature of PowerShell.  Quest Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets Previously, you learned that Microsoft Active Directory  MS AD  module was  introduced with Windows Server 2008 R2. So, how did system administrators manage  their Active Directory environments before the introduction of MS AD module?  Quest Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets were present at that time to simplify AD  operations. This Quest module has a bunch of cmdlets to perform various operations  in Active Directory. Even after Microsoft released Active Directory module, many  people still use Quest AD cmdlets because of its simplicity and the wide variety of  management options it provides.  Quest AD module is part of the Quest ActiveRoles Server product, which is used  for managing Active Directory objects. This Quest AD module is also referred to as  ActiveRoles Management Shell for Active Directory because it is an integral part of  the ActiveRoles product.  [ 12 ]   Installing Quest Quest software  now acquired by Dell  allows you to download ActiveRoles  Management Shell for free and you can download a copy from https:  support. software.dell.com download-install-detail 5024645. You will find two  versions of Quest AD Management Shell in the download page. Be sure to download  the latest one: v1.6.0.  While trying to install the MSI, you might get a prompt saying Microsoft .NET  Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 or later is required. You will experience this even  if you have .NET framework 4.0 installed on your computer. It seems the MSI is  specifically looking for .NET 3.5 SP1. So, ensure that you have .NET Framework 3.5  SP1 installed before you start installing the Quest AD management Shell MSI. You  might want to refer to the TechNet article at http:  technet.microsoft.com en- us library dn482071.aspx to understand NET Framework 3.5 installation process  on Windows Server 2012 R2.  After the completion of MSI, you can start using this module in two ways. You  can either search in Program Files for the application with the name ActiveRoles  Management Shell for Active Directory or you can add the Quest snap-in into the  regular PowerShell window.   It's preferred to add the snap-in directly into existing PowerShell windows rather  than opening a new Quest AD Shell when you want to manage Active Directory  using Quest cmdlets. Also if you are authoring any scripts based on Quest AD  cmdlets, it is best to add the snap-in in your code rather than asking the script   users to run it from a Quest AD Shell window.  The Quest AD Snap-in can be added to an existing PowerShell window using the   following command:  Add-PSSnapin Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement  After adding the snap-in, you can list the cmdlets provided by this snap-in using   the following command:  Get-Command -Module Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement  Get-Command is the cmdlet used to list cmdlets or functions inside a given module or  snap-in after importing them. The version  v1.6.0  of Quest AD Shell has 95 cmdlets.  Unlike Microsoft Active Directory module, the number of cmdlets will not change  from one operating system to another in Quest AD Shell. The list of cmdlets is the  same irrespective of the operating system where the tool is installed.  [ 13 ]   One advantage of Quest AD Shell is that it doesn't need Active Directory Web  services, which is mandatory for Microsoft Active Directory module. Quest AD Shell  works with Windows Server 2003-based domain controllers as well without the need  to install Active Directory Management Gateway Service.  Testing the functionality Open a new PowerShell window and try the following commands.   The Get-QADRootDSE cmdlet should return your current domain information.   All the Quest AD Shell cmdlets will have the word QAD prefixed to the noun:  Add-PSSnapin -Name Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement  Get-QADRootDSE  Using the Native method of PowerShell Both Microsoft AD module and Quest AD module have a dependency and require  additional software or components installed. If your environment cannot afford the  installation of new components, then you are left with only one option to manage  Active Directory using native PowerShell, which uses .NET classes. This doesn't  require any extra components to be installed and the only thing required is .NET,  which is present by default on any Windows operating system.  To query all computers in the current domain, use a query given in the   following command:   [ADSISearcher]"Objectclass=Computer" .Findall    The example shown in the following screenshot might look simple but, as you  need to do more with the native method approach, the complexity of the code will  increase. Also, you will find less help from the community when querying Active  Directory using the native method. Because of these reasons, Microsoft AD module  or Quest module are preferred for easy Active Directory operations. Use this  approach only if you have no other option.  [ 14 ]   Summary In this chapter, you learned about the tools that the PowerShell module requires  for managing Active Directory and how to get started with them. It is necessary to  install these tools and modules in your environment to facilitate Active Directory  operations using PowerShell.  Having these tools and modules in working condition is essential for practicing with  the code samples provided throughout this book.   In the next chapter, you will learn in detail about how to manage user and computer  Active Directory objects using PowerShell.  [ 15 ]    Managing User and  Computer Objects  In the previous chapter, we got familiarized with a list of tools required for  managing Active Directory using PowerShell. Now, let's get started with actual  management tasks and feel the real power of automation. This chapter enables you  to learn automation of a few user and computer account-related operations.  This chapter mainly focuses on accomplishing the following tasks using PowerShell:     Creating new user and computer accounts    Modifying user and computer objects    Enabling or disabling user and computer accounts    Moving user and computer accounts    Deleting user and computer accounts  Managing user accounts Active Directory is all about users and computers. Each user in the organization  will have at least one account. There will be scenarios where a single user can have  multiple accounts. This is very true in the case of IT users where one account is used  for regular activities such as checking emails, browsing, and so on, whereas, the  other privileged account is used for managing the infrastructure. Apart from this,  there are service accounts that are designed to run a particular service. This shows  how rapidly user accounts can grow in the Active Directory environment along   with the necessity to manage them in a much more efficient way.  The following sections will explain how to perform user object operations   using PowerShell.   Creating user accounts Managing user accounts is one of the day-to-day jobs as a Windows administrator.  New users join companies on a frequent basis and sometimes the volume might   go high. In such cases, creating user accounts using conventional methods is   time-consuming and prone to errors. So, relying on automation for creating new  users would be a wise choice and less time-consuming. In Active Directory, the manual account creation process involves Graphical User  Interface  GUI  tools, such as Active Directory Users and Computers  ADUC  or  Active Directory Administrative Center  ADAC . Let's first take a look at how user creation can be done using ADAC.  ADAC was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2. It relies on Active Directory  PowerShell cmdlets in Windows Server 2008 R2 and uses them in the background  to perform the Active Directory operations. ADAC is further enhanced in Windows  Server 2012 to expose the PowerShell commands that it uses in the background and  repays study.  The AD module can be loaded into a normal PowerShell window using the  following command:  Import-Module ActiveDirectory  Ensure that you open your PowerShell window in the elevated mode  run as  Administrator  to gain maximum benefits from the module.  Now, let's see the user creation process using a GUI tool named ADAC, shown in   the following screenshot:  [ 18 ]   There are two mandatory fields that must be provided in order to create a user  account: Full Name and User SamAccountName. Other fields are optional at the  time of user creation and can be updated later. You might have also noticed that  the password is not specified at the time of creation, so Active Directory keeps this  field in a disabled state until the password is set. Once the password is set by the  administrator, the user object has to be enabled explicitly.  Similarly, when a user account is created using PowerShell, it has one mandatory  property that must be passed, the Name parameter. This parameter is equivalent to  the Full Name value in UI. Also, the same parameter value is used for the user's  SamAccountName attribute at the time of user account creation using PowerShell. A user account in Active Directory can be created using the New-ADUser cmdlet.   The following command is a small example to show how user account creation   can be done:  New-ADUser -Name testuser1  [ 19 ]   When this command is executed from the PowerShell window, it creates a user  account in the default user container. The account created will be in a disabled   state because no password has been provided at the time of creation. This behavior   is different when you create users using ADUC, where providing a password   is mandatory.  The preceding one liner is just not sufficient for creating user accounts in the  production environment. You are required to provide values for different attributes  such as First Name, Last Name, Display Name, Password options  such as User  must change password at next logon or not , Office address, phone numbers, Job  title, Department, and the list goes on. So, we need to enhance our code to populate  these properties at the time of login.  Before we start creating a full-fledged user account, let's see which properties can be  populated by the New-ADUser cmdlet at the time of user creation. You can get this  simply by running the following help command:  Get-Help New-ADUser -Detailed  The Get-Help cmdlet is the PowerShell cmdlet to see the help content of any other  cmdlet. The usage of the –Detailed switch tells the Get-Help cmdlet to return all  the help content for the given cmdlet. It includes a list of parameters, their syntax,   an explanation of parameters, and examples.  To know more about each parameter, you can refer to the TechNet article at http:   technet.microsoft.com en-us library ee617253.aspx. This TechNet article  explains about data types that each parameter stores and this is important to  understand in order to read and write the attributes.  It is important to pay attention to the type of the value each  parameter takes. If you provide any other data type apart from  what it accepts, the New-ADUser cmdlet ends in an error. The type  of information that each parameter takes can be identified from the  TechNet page at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us  library ee617253.aspx.  As you can see in the preceding command, there are various properties  called  attributes in AD terminology  that you can set at the time of user creation. If the  attribute you want to set is not present, then you can use the OtherAttributes  parameter to set it. Note that you need to provide other attribute names and values  in hash table format while passing to the OtherAttributes parameter. Don't   worry about the use of hash tables. It is clearly explained later in this chapter   in the Modifying user properties section.  [ 20 ]   Now, let's see how we can create a user account by passing all kinds of values that  we want to set at the time of user creation. This example will cover some of the  properties that are frequently used at the time of user object creation. However, you  can modify this command and play around with setting other parameters. Practice  makes one perfect!!!  The passthru parameter is used to return the user object after creation of the  account. If this parameter is not specified, the cmdlet will not show any output after  successful creation of the object.  First, we need to prepare a password for the user to do the setting. Since the  -AccountPassword cmdlet requires the input to be in secure string format, we need  to populate the $password variable with the desired password, as shown by the  following command:  $Password = Read-Host "Enter the password that you want to set" -     AsSecureString  This will prompt you to enter the password and you will see asterisk symbols as you  enter. Ensure that the password you enter should meet the password complexity of  your domain, otherwise the following command will fail:  New-ADUser -Name Johnw -Surname "Williams" -GivenName "John" -     EmailAddress "john.williams@techibee.ad" -SamAccountName "johnw" -     AccountPassword $password -DisplayName "John Williams" -Department      "Sales" -Country "US" -City "New York" -Path      "OU=LAB,DC=Techibee,DC=AD" -Enabled $true -PassThru  Ensure that you update the -Path parameter in the preceding command to reflect   the distinguished name of the OU in your environment. Otherwise, the operation  might fail.  Note: The -Path parameter is optional. If you don't specify this,  the user account will be created in the default users container.  [ 21 ]   Executing the preceding command from PowerShell will return the output shown in  the following screenshot:  The output shows the path of the object where it is created and other properties we  set during the creation process. By default, the output shows only a minimum set of  attributes. You can see all current attributes and the values of a user object using the  the Get-ADUser cmdlet:  Get-ADUser -Identity JohnW -Properties *  Creating bulk user accounts So far, we have seen how to create a single user account in Active Directory.   Now, let's explore how to create multiple user accounts in one go.  The following command is sufficient enough if you want to create bulk user   objects in the LAB environment without worrying about other properties such   as department, email, and so on:  1..100  foreach { New-ADUser -Name "Labuser$_" -AccountPassword      $password -Path "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=AD"}  It is a simple foreach loop that runs 100 times to create a user account with the name  Labuser suffixed by the number of iteration  such as Labuser1, Labuser2, and so on.   with the password set to the value of the $password variable.  However, this is not sufficient to create user accounts in production environments.  We need to populate several attributes at the time of creation. Ideally, system  administrators receive the account creation information from HR in CSV format.  So, the example being demonstrated in the following screenshot reads the account  information from a CSV file, which has the details of user attributes, and creates   user accounts based on this information.  [ 22 ]   Let's first read the content of the CSV file into a PowerShell variable. A cmdlet called  Import-CSV is available in PowerShell that can read the contents of the CSV file and  return the output in object format. We can make use of it to read the contents, as  shown in the following command:  $Users = Import-CSV    $Users  Format-Table  This command will read the contents of the CSV file into the $Users variable.   The next statement will show the contents of the variable in table format. It should  look as follows:  Now, we have all user details in a variable, so let's proceed to create user accounts:  foreach $User in $Users  { New-ADUser -Name $User.LoginName -Surname $User.LastName -     GivenName $User.FirstName -EmailAddress $User.Email -     SamAccountName $User.LoginName -AccountPassword $Password -     DisplayName $User.DisplayName -Country $User.Country -City      $User.City -Path "OU=LAB,DC=Techibee,DC=AD" -Enabled $true -     PassThru }  The preceding code will loop through each object in the $Users variable and invoke  creation of user accounts by passing the properties of the $User object to parameters  of the New-ADUser cmdlet. The value of the -path parameter in code has been  hardcoded here, but you can make it part of the CSV file and pass it using the -Path  parameter during creation. Executing this code will create three accounts in Active  Directory with the details given in the CSV file.  [ 23 ]   All you need to do is populate the CSV file with the details you want to apply to  each user object and prepare the New-ADUser cmdlet accordingly. Refer to Chapter 9,  Miscellaneous Scripts and Resources for Further Learning for a more enhanced version   of bulk user creation script.  Modifying user properties In the previous section, we have seen how to create user accounts using Active  Directory PowerShell module. The task of the system administrator will not end  by just creating user objects in Active Directory; he she will also be responsible for  modifying and managing them. This section will help you understand the process  involved in modifying user accounts using PowerShell.  Since modifying user accounts has a very big scope, we will discuss a few example  cases where a bulk user modification is required. These examples will help you  understand the modification process. You can leverage these examples to modify   any other attributes in Active Directory:     Updating the description of a user object    Updating the telephone number of multiple users    Enabling or disabling user accounts in bulk    Moving user accounts to another OU  Before jumping on to modifying user properties, let's brush up on the basics basics.  To update the description of a user account, you will typically follow these steps:  1.  Open the ADAC tool  or ADUC . 2.  Search for a username in Active Directory. 3.  Go to the properties of the object. 4.  Update the description and save your changes by clicking on OK.  What happens under the hood when you update the description of the object and  save it? The system writes the value to a respective attribute of that user object. You  can view all attributes and their values using the Attribute Editor tab in ADAC    or ADUC in Windows Server 2008 R2 . To view this information from Windows  Server 2003, you need to use the adsiedit.msc tool.  Here are the attribute details of user objects we created during bulk user creation in  the previous section. You can see the values that are being read from the CSV file and  used for creation.  [ 24 ]   So, in order to update any details of a user object, first we need to know its attribute  name or display name.  Always remember that the names for properties you see in GUI  tools might not be the same as what you see in the attribute editor.  For example, the First Name field you see in GUI is translated to  givenName in the attribute editor.  Similar to the GUI approach, we can search for a user object and list its attributes  using PowerShell. The Get-ADUser cmdlet can be used for this:  Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -eq "ChrisB" }  This will return the user object with the Name attribute having the value ChrisB.   By default, it will return only a basic set of attributes. If you want to see all   attributes of this user object, then specify the -Property parameter, as shown   in the following command:  Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -eq "ChrisB" } -Property *  You can also query users matching their name Chris by adjusting the value of the  -Filter parameter, as shown in the following command:  Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -like "Chris*" }  [ 25 ]   Similarly, we can query all objects inside a particular Organizational Unit by   passing the OU distinguished name to the -SearchBase parameter, as shown   in the following command:  Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=LAB,dc=techibee,dc=ad"  Now that we know how to search for objects, let's move on to learn how to   modify them.  Updating the description of a user object In the previous section, you learned how to search and find a user object.   Let's use that logic and get an instance of the ChrisB user object, as shown   in the following command:  $UserObj = Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -eq "ChrisB" } -Properties *  The $UserObj variable stores the reference to the ChrisB user object. We can view  the current description of the user object by using the following command, assuming   the user account has a description set:  $UserObj.Description  To replace the current description with new value, first we need to understand   what data type this attribute will accept. As we mentioned before, we can find this  out using the GetType   method. You can invoke this method, as shown in the  following command:  $userObj.Description.GetType    The output of this command shows that it accepts data of string, as shown in the  following screenshot:  To update the description to a new value, we need to use the Set-ADuser cmdlet and  pass the $UserObj to the -Identity parameter and the string that you want to set in  the description field to the -Description parameter. The following command will  return to the PS prompt in the PowerShell window if it completes without any errors:  Set-ADUser -Identity $UserObj -Description "Added new description via      PowerShell"  [ 26 ]   To verify if the new description is updated in the user description field, we can either  check it through the GUI or run the PowerShell command that we used for querying  the user object in the preceding command.  Putting everything together, the following code will update the description of a  given Active Directory user:  $UserName = "ChrisB" $NewDescription = "Delete this account after November" $UserObj = Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -eq $UserName} -Properties * Write-Host "Current description is : $ $UserObj.Description " Set-ADUser -Identity $UserObj -Description $NewDescription $UserObj = Get-ADUser -Filter {Name -eq $UserName} -Properties * Write-Host "New description is : $ $UserObj.Description "  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books  you have purchased from your account at http:  www. packtpub.com. If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can  visit http:  www.packtpub.com support and register to  have the files e-mailed directly to you.  You can update values of any other attribute using the procedure explained in this  code. As a matter of practice, try updating the DisplayName of a user.  Remember? Practice makes perfect!!!  Updating the telephone numbers of   multiple users In the previous example, you learned how to update the value of description using  PowerShell. Now, let's take a look at updating telephone numbers of multiple users.  This operation is a little different from updating the description operation. Here, we  have two complexities, which are as follows:  1.  We don't know which attribute will get updated when a number is added    to the telephone number field in the GUI.  2.  Performing a telephone number update for multiple users by reading from    a text file or CSV file.  [ 27 ]   Let's address these complexities one by one. First, we need to identify attributes that  need to be updated. In this demonstration, we want to update the Office telephone  number, Home number, and mobile number of the users. If these users already  have these numbers set, then we can use the attribute editor to identify the attribute  names that need to be updated. If not, set these telephone numbers for one user  account and then use attribute editor to identify the attribute names. Alternatively,  you can use the Get-ADUser cmdlet to retrieve all attributes. The PowerShell way  is preferred here, as we want to learn more and more about it. Examine the output  of the following command carefully and identify the attribute names that have the  telephone numbers you see in the GUI:  Get-ADUser -Identity chrisB -Properties *  You will notice that the following command has the telephone numbers you see   in the GUI:  Get-ADUser -Identity ChrisB -Properties *  select HomePhone,      OfficePhone, mobile    The description of the preceding command is shown in the following:     OfficePhone: This attribute contains the phone number that you see under  the Main field in telephone numbers in ADAC. In ADUC, you will see this  number in the Telephone number field in the General tab.     HomePhone: This is the phone number you will see in the Home Phone field.    mobile: This attribute contains the phone number you will see in the    Mobile field.  First, let's update the telephone details of one user, then we can extend the logic   to update other users in bulk.  Let's store the numbers in variables first, as shown in the following commands:  $OfficeNumber = "+65 12345678"  $HomeNumber = "+65 87654321"  $MobileNumber = "+65 13578642"  The next step is to update the preceding values for a user account, as shown in the  following command:  Set-ADUser -Identity ChrisB -OfficePhone $OfficeNumber -HomePhone      $HomeNumber -MobilePhone $MobileNumber  [ 28 ]   This is straightforward because the Set-ADUser cmdlet has parameters that can set  these phone numbers. If the attribute that you are trying to set is not available as  a parameter to the cmdlet then you can use the -Add parameter to directly specify  the attribute name and the value. Similarly, you can use other parameters such as  -Replace and -Clear to work with attributes directly. The preceding example can  be rewritten using the -Add parameter, as shown in the following commands:  Set-ADUser -Identity ChrisB -Clear telephonenumber, homephone, mobile  Set-ADUser -Identity ChrisB -Add @{telephonenumber = $OfficeNumber;      homephone = $HomeNumber ; mobile = $MobileNumber }   Here, we are setting the office phone number to the telephonenumber attribute,  the home number to the homephone attribute, and the mobile number to the mobile  attribute. Before setting them, we will clear existing values using the -Clear  parameter.  Now, we can extend this logic to multiple users using a for loop in PowerShell.   Before doing this, store the user names and numbers you want to set in a CSV file  and import it into PowerShell. The following screenshot shows how the contents   of the CSV look:  And the code to set the telephone numbers is as follows:  $Users = Import-CSV c:\temp\usersPhoneNumbers.csv foreach $User in $Users  { Set-ADUser -Identity $User.UserName -OfficePhone $User.OfficeNumber  -HomePhone $User.HomeNumber -MobilePhone $User.MobileNumber }  Enabling or disabling user accounts Now, let's take a look at another scenario where we want to perform bulk user  enable disable operation. Fortunately, there are two cmdlets provided in Active  Directory module to make this operation very easy and straightforward.  [ 29 ]   They are as follows:     Enable-ADAccount: This cmdlet is used for enabling Active Directory user,   computer, or service account objects     Disable-ADAccount: This cmdlet is used for disabling Active Directory user,   computer, or service account objects  Both these cmdlets require an object to be enabled disabled. The object can be in one   of the following formats:     Distinguished Name  DN  format, for example, CN=ChrisB, OU=LAB,   DC=techibee, and DC=ad     ObjectGUID format, for example, 923199de-0dd9-4758-a954-5aa42409b10d    Security Identifier  SID  format, for example S-1-5-21-822638036-2026389545-  1116158610-1244     SAMAccountName format, for example, ChrisB  To get these values for a given user, use the Get-ADUser cmdlet  use Get-ADComputer  in the case of computer accounts   Now, it's just a matter of passing the input values to either the Enable-ADAccount or  Disable-ADAccount cmdlets based on which operation you want to perform.  Here are some common usage scenarios. These scenarios cover disable operations;  to perform enable operations in a similar way, just replace the Disable-ADAccount  cmdlet with the Enable-ADAccount cmdlet.  The following command can be used to disable a single user account:  Disable-ADAccount -Identity ChrisB -Passthru  The -PassThru parameter is used to return the object after the completion of the  operation. Also it is useful to know the disable status if you want to perform further  actions on this object.  You can disable users in a particular OU. The following command will return all  users objects under LAB OU and its sub OUs:  Get-ADUser -SearchBase "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=AD" -Filter *       Disable-ADAccount  To limit the search scope to the current OU, use the -SearchScope parameter. It  takes three values: Basic  or 0 , OneLevel  or 1 , a Subtree  or 2 . Subtree is the   default value when nothing is specified.  [ 30 ]   Read usernames from a text file and disable them, as shown in the following  command:  Get-Content C:\temp\users.txt  % { Disable-ADAccount -Identity $_ }  Here, the Get-Content cmdlet reads the usernames from the text file and passes  them one by one to the Disable-ADAccount cmdlet using a foreach loop  % is an  alias for a foreach loop in PowerShell . When passing the user name to the Disable- ADAccount cmdlet, we use the $_ automatic variable, which contains the name that is  passed from the pipeline. Read more about automatic variables at http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library hh847768.aspx.  You can disable all users in a department, for example, Sales. The following  command queries all users who have their department value set to sales and   passes them to the Disable-ADAccount cmdlet to disable them:  Get-ADUser -Filter 'Department -eq "sales"'  Disable-ADAccount  Likewise, to perform an enable operation, just replace Disable-ADAccount with the  Enable-ADAccount cmdlet in the preceding examples.  Moving user accounts to another OU For example, let's consider a scenario where all users of one department are moved  from one office building to another. So, you would like to move all these user  accounts to a new OU for ease of identification and management.  The Move-ADObject cmdlet is available in Active Directory module to accomplish  this operation. As you might have already noted, this particular cmdlet can move  any object from one OU to another; not just user accounts.  This cmdlet has two mandatory parameters:     Identity: This identifies the object that you want to move. It can be either   the Distinguished name  DN  of the object or the GUID of the object.     TargetPath: The TargetPath parameter must be the Distinguished Name    DN  of OU or the container to which you want to move the objects.  Here are some use case scenarios:     Moving a user account from one OU to another:  Move-ADObject -Identity "CN=ChrisB,OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -     TargetPath "OU=Singapore,OU=LAB,DC=Techibee,DC=ad"  Here, ChrisB is the name of the user that we are moving from the current  location  specified in the DN  to the new -TargetPath parameter.  [ 31 ]      Moving all users from LAB OU to PROD OU  Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad"       Move-ADObject -TargetPath "OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad" The preceding command will move all users  including users in sub OUs   from LAB OU to PROD OU. The -Identity parameter is automatically  populated from the output of the Get-ADUser cmdlet.  You can use the following command to move users from one OU to another based on  their department name:  Get-ADUser -Filter 'department -eq "Sales"'  Move-ADObject -TargetPath  "OU=Sales,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD"  Remember: The target OU must exist before you move users to it. The distinguished name of an object should always be unique; the  common name portion of the distinguished name can, however, be  used more than once.  Deleting user accounts The Active Directory PowerShell module has a cmdlet called Remove-ADUser to  delete user accounts from Active Directory. Alternatively, the Remove-ADObject  cmdlet can be used. The Remove-ADUser cmdlet is designed to deal with user  accounts removal. We will use this cmdlet throughout the examples in this section.  The requests for removal of user accounts increase as the attrition rate increases in  your organization. You get requests from HR to delete user accounts on a frequent  basis either when an employee leaves the organization or he she turns down the  offer just before joining.  Most organizations won't delete user accounts when an employee  leaves the organization. Instead, they will hide these from the Global  Address List Book  GAL , remove them from all groups, disable the  mailbox, and keep the ID in a disabled state. Such accounts can be  enabled if the employee rejoins the company later.  Removing a user account from Active Directory is a straightforward process. You  just need to pass the DN or ObjectGUID, SID or SamAccountName to the -Identity  parameter of the Remove-ADUser cmdlet. In the following example, Samaccountname  is passed to the -Identity parameter, as shown in the following command:  Remove-ADUser -Identity ChrisB  [ 32 ]   When this command is executed, it will ask for confirmation of deletion, as shown in  the following screenshot:  Since deletion is a critical operation, Active Directory module warns about it. If  you are certain that the inputs are correct and you don't want to get prompted for  confirmation, set the -Confirm parameter value to $false, as shown in the   following command:  Remove-ADUser -Identity ChrisB -Confirm:$false  Similarly, to delete user accounts by reading from a text file, use the following  command:  Get-Content C:\temp\users.txt  % { Remove-ADUser -Identity $_ -     Confirm:$false}  The Get-Content cmdlet reads the usernames from users.txt and passes them to  the Remove-ADUser cmdlet to delete the accounts one after another.  Managing computer accounts In previous sections, we have seen several operational tasks that can be performed  on user accounts in Active Directory using PowerShell. This section focuses on  performing similar operations on computer objects.  Managing computer objects is not much different from managing user objects. All you  need to do is to use the correct cmdlets and the rest of the process remains the same.  The following topics are covered as a part of managing computer accounts using  PowerShell. Let's go through these one by one and understand how we can  accomplish them:     Creating computer accounts    Modifying computer properties    Enabling or disabling computer accounts    Deleting computer accounts  [ 33 ]   Creating computer accounts Most system administrators do not create computer accounts manually in Active  Directory. Instead, they join computers to the domain and the account gets created  automatically. After automatic object creation, the administrator moves   the computer accounts from the default container to the desired OU.  Well, this might look quite simple but why is there a need to create a manual  computer account? The aforementioned approach will work for small organizations  where one set of system administrators will manage everything and they will  have all privileges. However, in large organizations, this is not feasible for various  reasons. In large organizations the desktop server builds happen in an automated  way using deployment solutions, such as Windows Development Services  WDS   where the build process looks for a computer account in AD to join the server  desktop to the domain. This process is called prestaging of computer accounts and it  has a good set of advantages such as choosing the OU where you want to place the  computer, group membership, and so on.  So, let's now look at a few examples of creating a computer account. Active Directory  provides a cmdlet called New-ADComputer to facilitate the computer account creation.  The following command will create a computer account with the name SRVMEM2 in  the default computers container:  New-ADComputer -Name SRVMEM2 -PassThru  To create computer account in a particular Organizational Unit in Active Directory,  use the following command:  New-ADComputer -Name SRVMEM2 -Path      "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD" -PassThru  Ensure that the OU mentioned in the preceding command exists prior to the  computer account creation; if not, the command execution fails.  If you just want to create the computer account but keep it in a disabled state, the  following command helps:  New-ADComputer -Name SRVMEM2 -Path      "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD" -Enabled $false -PassThru  Notice: The -Enable parameter in the preceding command, which is  set to $false, is responsible for disabling the computer account.  [ 34 ]   To see the list of other options for this cmdlet and some examples, read its complete  help content. This can done using the following command:  Get-Help New-ADComputer -Full  Modifying computer accounts Computer account attributes often need to be modified. For example, because many  computer accounts are created before the computers are actually assigned to users,  attributes such as description, department, and location cannot be configured at  the time an account is created. In addition, the ownership of a computer can be  transferred to a new user or department, or a computer might be physically moved  to a new location. In such circumstances, the computer account attributes need to   be modified.  Let's see the PowerShell way of doing this using various cmdlets available for  computer objects.  Setting the description for a computer account Active Directory PowerShell module has the Set-ADComputer cmdlet for modifying  computer account properties in Active Directory. Remember the Set-ADUser cmdlet   we used for modifying user object properties? It is similar to that but for computer  accounts.  To update the description of a single computer, you can use the following command.  This example updates the description of the SRVMEM1 computer object:  Set-ADComputer –identity SRVMEM1 –description "Member Server"  The Set-ADComputer cmdlet has ability to set values for the majority of object  attributes. To see the list of attributes it can set, check its help content using the  following command:  Get-Help Set-ADComputer -Full  [ 35 ]   You can use the Get-ADComputer command to check if the description is set as  shown in the following screenshot:  Moving computer accounts to a different OU Sometimes, you might need to move computer accounts to different OUs as the user  might change the location or server accounts in order to segregate them according  to their roles; or you might want to move computer accounts from the default OU to  respective office location OUs.  Let's see a few of the examples related to computer account movements across  Organizational Units. As we have done for user accounts, here too we can make use  of the Move-ADObject cmdlet to move computer accounts from one OU to another.  The following command moves the SRVMEM1 computer account from the default  computer container to Computers OU inside PROD OU:  Move-ADObject -Identity "CN=SRVMEM1,CN=Computers,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -     TargetPath "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -PassThru  Since it is not possible to provide the full DN of the object we want to move every  time, we can either use the Get-ADComputer or Search-ADAccount cmdlet to search  by its name or some other property and then pass the output to the Move-ADObject  cmdlet. The following example demonstrates this:  Get-ADComputer -Filter "name -eq 'SRVMEM1'"  Move-ADObject -     TargetPath "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -PassThru  Similarly, we search for a string in the description of the computer objects and move  them to the designated OU using the following command:  Get-ADComputer -Filter "description -like '*server*'"  Move-ADObject  -TargetPath "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -PassThru  [ 36 ]   This command will look for computer accounts that have the string server in their  description and will move them to the designated OU. Similarly, you can search  based on any other criteria and move them to different OUs, as shown in the  preceding command.  Enabling or disabling computer accounts As a system administrator, it is required to keep your Active Directory database  clean, tidy, and minimal in size. Also, one must adhere to the security policies of  the organization and often needs to reconcile computer accounts data monthly,  quarterly, and annually in accordance with those security policies.  The cmdlet we use here is not specific to computer objects; it can also be used for   any Active Directory user, computer, or service accounts.  Use the following command to enable a particular computer:  Get-ADComputer -Identity COMP1  Enable-ADAccount  To enable multiple computer accounts, you can use filters in conjunction with the  Get-ADComputer or Search-ADAccount cmdlets. The following command will  search for computer accounts inside the given OU and it will enable all of them:  Get-ADComputer -Filter "*" -SearchBase      "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  Enable-ADAccount -     PassThru  Similarly, to disable computer accounts, just replace Enable-ADAccount with the  Disable-ADAccount cmdlet. The following command disables all of the computers  inside the given OU:  Get-ADComputer -Filter "*" -SearchBase      "OU=Computers,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  Disable-ADAccount -     PassThru  Explore more by referring to the help content of these cmdlets. For example, to see  the help of the Get-ADComputer cmdlet, you can use the following command:  Get-Help Get-ADComputer -Detailed  You can read the help content from TechNet site as well  http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library ee617192.aspx .  [ 37 ]   Deleting computer accounts As discussed in the previous section, as a system administrator one must adhere to  the security policies of the organization and keep their Active Directory database  clean and tidy. As part of this process, you might want to delete stale offline  computer objects from Active Directory.  Use the following simple command to delete a computer account:  Remove-ADComputer -Identity COMP1  The most common use case is searching for computers older than x days and  removing them. You can achieve this using the following command:  $Computers = Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties LastLogonDate  ?      {$_.LastLogonDate -lt  get-date .Adddays -10  }  $Computers  Remove-ADComputer  You need to be very careful while performing the delete operation. Any  mistake in the filters can result in your production computers being  deleted. So, I prefer storing the Get-ADComputer cmdlet results in  a variable  $computer in this example , reviewing the list, and then  passing it to the Remove-ADComputer cmdlet.  The first line in the preceding code searches Active Directory for computers that are  not contacted in the last 30 days and stores them in a variable. Later, we can pass the  variable to the Remove-ADComputer cmdlet to delete them. By default, this cmdlet  will prompt for each deletion; you can override it using the -Confirm:$false  property with the Remove-ADComputer cmdlet.  To delete multiple computer accounts that have location value set to OFFICE1, you  can use the following command:  Get-ADComputer –filter 'Location –eq "OFFICE1"'  Remove-ADComputer –     confirm:$false  Use the following command to delete all computer accounts in a particular OU:  Get-ADComputer –SearchBase "OU=DisabledComp,DC=techibee,DC=ad"       Remove-ADComputer –confirm:$false  [ 38 ]   These examples will help you to get started. For instance, you can use the   Get-ADComputer cmdlet to search computer accounts using different patterns   and pass them to the Remove-ADComputer cmdlet to delete them.  Deletion of user accounts or computer accounts is a critical operation  and reverting these changes is not possible in all cases. So, you should  verify what you are searching and removing. Review the output  of the Get-ADComputer cmdlet twice before you pass it to the  Remove-ADComputer cmdlet.  Summary In this chapter, we have seen how to manage Active Directory users and computer  accounts using PowerShell. The examples quoted in each section will help you to get  started. You can enhance your learning further by reviewing the help content of each  cmdlet that we have used throughout this chapter.  You might wonder why managing group membership of users and computers is not  covered in this chapter. Considering the fact that group membership changes are  more frequent in Active Directory environment, the next chapter focuses in depth on  this topic. Various operations related to groups and their memberships are covered  there in great detail.  [ 39 ]    Working with Active Directory  Groups and Memberships  In the previous chapter, you learned about managing user and computer objects  using PowerShell. Now let's discuss how to manage Active Directory groups and  their memberships.  In this chapter, we will see how to perform the following operations in Active  Directory using PowerShell cmdlets:     Creating local, global, and universal security groups    Searching and modifying group object information    Adding group members, user and computer accounts to the security groups    Listing members of a security group in Active Directory    Removing user or computer accounts from groups    Removing a groups from groups    Deleting or removing the AD groups  To start with, let's recollect some basic concepts about Active Directory groups and  their memberships.   What is a group? A group is a collection of different Active Directory objects such   as user accounts, computer accounts, and groups. Active Directory groups are  basically categorized into two types: Security groups and Distribution Lists Groups   DL . A security group can be used to grant permissions to various resources in  a network such as granting permissions to shares, New Technology File System   NTFS  permissions, printer permissions, and many more similar activities. DL is an  e-mail-enabled group, using which information can be shared via e-mail to a group   of people simultaneously. Security groups can be mail-enabled and used as a DL   and vice versa.  Both of these groups are further characterized by a scope that identifies the extent to  which the group is applied in a domain tree or forest. This means that the scope of  a group determines whether it can have members from the same domain, different  domains, or different forests. There are three types of scope available in Active  Directory that apply to both of these groups. They are universal, global, and   domain local.  Note that, because distribution groups are used for e-mail and most  importantly for Microsoft Exchange applications, we are limiting  our discussion to security groups in this chapter. The approaches  described in this article are applicable for distribution group as well.  However, the PowerShell cmdlets provided by Microsoft Exchange  application are more suitable to manage distribution groups. You  may want to refer to group cmdlets mentioned on the TechNet page  available at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library  bb124233%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx.  In a Windows environment, Active Directory security groups play an important role.  Using groups to delegate grant permissions is very scalable compared to granting  permissions to an individual user or computer account. Given these reasons, the  number of group membership changes made in any organization on a day-to- day basis is very high. Since it is one of the tedious tasks every Windows system  administrator has to perform on a daily basis, it is important to understand how to  automate it to its maximum extent.  [ 42 ]   Creating different types of security  groups As mentioned before, there are different types of security groups available in Active  Directory: global, domain local, and universal. You may refer to the TechNet article  at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library cc755692 v=ws.10 .aspx to  know more about group scopes.  To create a new group in Active Directory, the New-ADGroup cmdlet can be  used. This cmdlet accepts three parameters. These are name of the group, the  Organizational Unit path in AD, and groupScope, such as domain local global  universal. Of these, name and groupScope need to be provided mandatorily.  Here is the simple command line to create a new blank AD group in AD with no  members in it.  The following command creates a new Active Directory group of type DomainLocal  in the specified OU:  New-ADGroup -Name "Test Group1" -Path      "OU=Groups,OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -groupScope domainlocal  Similarly, to create other group types, change the parameter -groupScope. The  following sample command creates a global group and a universal group:  New-ADGroup -Name "Test Group Global" -Path      "OU=Groups,OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -groupScope global  New-ADgroup -Name "Test Group Universal" -Path      "OU=Groups,OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -groupScope universal  Note that we just modified the groupScope parameter details and  rest of the command line remains the same. The name of the group  can be anything of your choice.  Searching and modifying group object  information Searching Active Directory for the presence of a group is similar to searching users  and groups. A cmdlet called Get-ADGroup from the Active Directory module can be  used to get group object information.  [ 43 ]   For example, we can use the following command to get display names of all groups  in Active Directory:  Get-ADGroup -Filter *  select Name  By specifying asterisk  *  as an argument to the -Filter parameter, we are querying  all groups in Active Directory and then displaying the value of the Name property  using the select statement.  To search for a specific group by name, we can pass the name of the group to the  -Filter parameter, as shown in the following command:  Get-ADGroup -Filter "Name -eq 'Test Group1'"  This command searches Active Directory for groups with the name that exactly  matches Test Group1 and returns the group object if present; otherwise, no output  is seen.  There is another parameter that helps in performing the search operation in Active  Directory, that is, the -LDAPFilter parameter. The -Filter and -LDAPFilter  parameters perform the same type of search operation but the syntax in which you  pass the values is different. The -Filter parameter takes the PowerShell type of  syntax and -LDAPFilter takes the LDAP type of syntax. The example command  shown in the preceding command was written using the -Filter parameter, which  uses the PowerShell syntax. The same command can be rewritten using -LDAPFilter  as shown in the following command:  Get-ADGroup -LDAPFilter " Name=Test Group1 "  Based on your comfort level, you can use either the -Filter or -LDAPFilter  parameter to perform searches. This is applicable for other cmdlets such as the   Get-ADUser and Get-ADComputer parameters. Another difference to note here is that  -Filter can take the property names returned by cmdlets in the ActiveDirectory  module but the -LDAPFilter parameter requires the exact attribute names.  In general, using the -Filter parameter to perform search operations is  sufficient. The -LDAPFilter parameter can be used to test the existing  LDAP filters or the filters used in other programming languages that  query Active Directory using LDAP.  [ 44 ]   You can read more about AD filters at the following TechNet page: http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library  hh531527%28v=ws.10%29.aspx Also, there are a couple of blog posts from the Active Directory  PowerShell blog explaining the advanced filters, which are as follows: http:  blogs.msdn.com b adpowershell  archive 2009 04 03 active-directory-powershell- advanced-filter.aspx http:  blogs.msdn.com b adpowershell  archive 2009 04 14 active-directory-powershell- advanced-filter-part-ii.aspx  Now that we know how to search for a single group in Active Directory, let's see  how we can perform a search for multiple groups using the Get-ADGroup cmdlet.  Groups that match a particular naming convention can be queried using the  following command:  Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -like '*test*'}  This command will return all group objects that have the string test in their   Name property.  The -Filter parameter can be further customized to cater to various searching  needs. For example, we can extend our previous code to search for groups that  contain the string Domain in their Name attribute. Look at the following command:  Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -like '*test*' -or Name -like '*Domain*'}  Similarly, if you have a list of groups in a text file and you want to know whether  they are present in Active Directory, we can use the following code:  $Groups = Get-Content c:\temp\Groups.txt foreach $Group in $Groups  {   $GroupObj = Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -eq $Group}   if $GroupObj  {     "{0} : Group Found" -f $Group   } else {         "{0} : Group NOT Found" -f $Group     } }  [ 45 ]   This is a simple code that reads the group names from a text file located at c:\temp\ groups.txt, loops through each group name in the text file, and checks whether it is  present in Active Directory or not.  Once you have the object information of the group you are looking for, it is easy  to modify the group object information using the Set-ADGroup cmdlet. Group  object information is the display name of the group, description, group type, and  so on. Modifying the membership of the groups doesn't fall within the scope of this  chapter. The next chapter will talk in detail about membership modification.  The following command will help in adding a description to the group objects. The  Get-ADGroup cmdlet will query Active Directory based on the provided filters and  the results are passed to the Set-ADGroup cmdlet so that it can set the description   to a defined string:  Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -eq "TestGroup" }  Set-ADGroup -     Description "This Group Created for testing purpose only"  If you want to update the description for all groups that have Test in their name,  then the following command can be used:  Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -like "*Test*" }   Set-ADGroup -     Description "This Group is created for testing purpose"  Similarly, GroupScope can be changed using the Set-ADGroup cmdlet, as shown in  the following command:  Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -eq "TestGroup" }  Set-ADGroup -GroupScope      DomainLocal  To see the current scope, and the group category of the group, you can use the  following command:  Get-ADGroup -Identity TestGroup  select Name, GroupCategory,      GroupScope  The output will look like the following screenshot:  [ 46 ]   Also, the group type  security distribution  can be changed by passing the required  type to the -GroupCategory parameter of the Set-ADGroup cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:  Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -like "*Test*" }   Set-ADGroup -     GroupCategory Distribution  Groups can be configured as e-mail-enabled security groups,  which helps in both sending e-mails and granting security  permissions. Since e-mail-enabled security groups require  Microsoft Exchange installation, this topic is not covered here.  The Microsoft Exchange PowerShell snap-in has a cmdlet that can  configure a security group as a mail-enabled security group.  So far, you learned about searching for groups; now let's move forward to the  important topic of group membership modification.  Adding members to a group In the previous sections, we saw how to create groups in Active Directory, how to  search for them, and how to change group object information. Groups are useless  without members in them. In this section, we will concentrate on how to add both  user accounts and computer accounts to security groups in Active Directory.  Like any other operation, Active Directory module has a cmdlet to add members   to groups. The Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet does this for you.  To add a member to the group, use the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet with the member  parameter. Use the samaccountName of the member user for ease of addition.  Adding user accounts to groups Adding a single user account to a security group is very straightforward with the  Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  Add-ADGroupMember –Identity "Group1-Read" –Members LabUser1  Multiple users can be added to security groups by passing their names to the  -Members attribute as shown in the following command:  Add-ADGroupMember –Identity "Group1-Read" –Members      LabUser1,LabUser2,LabUser3  [ 47 ]   Say you want to add a single user to multiple groups at the same time. This can be  achieved by using following command:  "TestGroup","Group1-Read"  % {Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $_ -     Members LabUser3 }  The preceding command will add the LabUser3 user account to the TestGroup and  Group-Read groups. Here, we pass group names to the identity parameter of the  Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet one after the other to add LabUser3.  One of the common use cases for system administrators is that they will have a list   of users to be added in a text file. When you have such a requirement, adding the  users to a specific group is as simple as the following command:  $Users = Get-Content C:\temp\users.txt  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members $Users  In the previous example, we saw how to add user accounts to a text file. Now, let's  see how to add all users from an Organizational Unit to a security group by using  the following command:  $Users = Get-ADUser -SearchBase "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,dc=ad" -Filter      {objectclass -eq "User" }  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members $Users  The first line in the preceding code will query all users in the given Organizational  Unit and store the details in the $User variable. The same variable is passed to the  -Members parameter of the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet in the second line. This kind  of additional cmdlet is useful if you have an OU structure based on departments,  buildings, and offices, and you want to add all sales users to one security group, all  users in the same building to another security group, and so on.  Similarly, we can copy members from one security group to another by following a  sample command:  $members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup-Copy -Members $members  The first line reads the membership details of the TestGroup security group and  stores it in a variable. Then, the same variable is passed to the Add-ADGroupMember  cmdlet to add members to a new security group TestGroup-Copy. Here, you should  note that the target group should be created beforehand.  [ 48 ]   Adding computer accounts to groups Adding computer accounts to groups is no different than adding users. All you need  to do is just replace the user name with the computer account name. The only thing  that you need to do is add the suffix dollar  $  symbol to the computer name while  attempting the addition.  To add a single computer account to a security group, use the following command:  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members "COMP1$"  You might wonder why the dollar sign should be used along with the computer  name. This is simple. In Active Directory, each computer's SamaccountName is stored  in the same format. To check SamaccountName of a computer, use the following  command snippet:  Get-ADComputer -Identity COMP1  select SamaccountName  You might wonder why we add computers to security groups. Many  organizations create Group Policies and target them to list computer  names by adding the computer accounts to a security group and  granting apply permissions to that group alone. Similarly, such groups  based on the computer accounts are used for tasks such as software  deployments, performing reboots, scheduling jobs, and so on.  Computer accounts can be added to security groups based on a certain string in their  name. For example, each organization will have a naming standard; for example, all  test computers might have a string TEST somewhere in their name, and production  could have a string such as PROD in the name. In such cases, if you would like to  automatically add all TEST servers to one security group and all PROD severs to  another security group, you can utilize the following sample example, adjust it  according to your needs, and schedule it so that all new computers will be added to  the groups automatically.  To do this, first let's read the computers with TEST in their name to a variable called  $TestServers, and all computers that have PROD in their name to $ProdServers.  We can do this by using the Get-ADComputer cmdlet with a filter. as shown in the  following command:  $TestServers = Get-ADComputer -Filter {Name -like "*TEST*"}  $ProdServers = Get-ADComputer -Filter {Name -like "*PROD*" }  [ 49 ]   Once these variables are populated with the computer accounts, we can add them  to the designated groups by using the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet, as shown in the  following command, by passing them to the -Members parameter:  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "All Test Servers" -Members $TestServers  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "All Prod Servers" -Members $ProdServers  After running the preceding command, all your TEST computers should be added  to the All Test Servers security group and all the PROD servers should be added  to the All Prod Servers security group. The membership of these groups can be  viewed by the Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet.  So far we discussed various ways of adding members to security groups. This is not  an exhaustive list and the requirement can be different from case to case. So all you  need to remember is, you should have the users computers that you want to add  saved to a variable. Then, you just need to pass it to the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet  to add them to the required group.  Adding one group as a member to an other In previous sections, we saw how to add user accounts and computer accounts to  security groups by using the Active Directory cmdlets. Another common Active  Directory operation related to security groups is adding one security group to  another security group. This is done for ease of management of permissions   and memberships.  Before proceeding to see how groups can be nested, let's first understand what type   scope  of groups can be added to a given security group. Without this, you might  run into errors such as the following and start scratching your head to see where it  went wrong:  If you read the error message carefully, it clearly states that a universal group cannot  be added to a domain local group. It is good to know these things before attempting  to add a group in another group.  [ 50 ]   The TechNet article at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library  dn579255.aspx gives a clear overview of different security group types, their  allowed membership details, and scope conversion details. In short:     A universal group can hold global and universal groups from any domain in   the same forest as members     A global group can hold other global groups from the same forest    A domain local group can hold global groups from any domain  including   trusted , universal groups from the same forest, domain groups from the  same domain, and global and universal groups from other forests  Once you are familiar with groups, let's start with simple group nesting using the  following command:  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members TestGroup1  This command adds a group named TestGroup1 to TestGroup. If you notice, we are  not providing any group scope information at the time of adding. The cmdlet will  automatically calculate the groups and, if the addition is not supported, it will throw  errors; otherwise, execution should get completed without any errors.  As you can see in the following screenshot, the group TestGroup1 is added   to TestGroup:  [ 51 ]   As we saw in the examples of adding bulk users and computer accounts to a group,  security groups can be added in bulk as well. For this demonstration, I created 100  security groups in Active Directory so that I can add them to a new security group   in bulk.  Creating bulk groups is very easy if they share a similar naming convention,   as shown in the following code:  1..100  % { $GroupName = "ChildGroup{0}" -f $_ New-ADGroup -Name $GroupName -GroupScope DomainLocal -Path      "OU=Groups,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD" }  Running the preceding code from PowerShell created 100 groups with the name  ChildGroupX in hardly 4 to 5 seconds. Now, these can be added to another security  group as a members.  First, let's create a group to which we want to add these newly created 100 groups.  As we saw before, a group can be created by using the New-ADGroup cmdlet. The  following command will create the ParentGroup1 security group:  New-AdGroup -Name ParentGroup1 -GroupScope DomainLocal  Once the preceding group is created, we can add the newly created 100 ChildGroup  value to the preceding group using the following command:  $Groups = Get-ADGroup -Filter { Name -like "ChildGroup*" }  Add-ADGroupMember -Identity ParentGroup1 -Members $Groups  The first line of the code will search Active Directory for any group that has a name  starting with ChildGroup and stores the details in the $Groups variable. Once the  details are available, they can be added to another security group, ParentGroup1,  using the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet as shown in the code on the next page.  Listing members of a security group in  Active Directory So far we saw the addition of various Active Directory objects  users, computers, and  groups  to security groups, but how do we know that they are actually added? How  do we find out the current members of a given security group?  [ 52 ]   These questions can be simply answered with the Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet in  Active Directory. As the name of the cmdlet indicates, it queries the members of a  given group. For example, let's see the membership of one of the groups that we  updated in the previous example, by using the following command:  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity ParentGroup1  Measure-Object  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity ParentGroup1  select Name  Refer to the following screenshot of the preceding command for more clarity:  The Measure-Object cmdlet shows how many objects are returned from the   Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet when queried for the members of ParentGroup1.  Remember that this is the same group where we added several child groups in   the previous section while demonstrating the nested group addition operation.   The second command shows the actual members. For ease of understanding,   I just selected the Name property from the output using the select parameter.  As mentioned before, groups can have users, computers, and other groups   as members, but how do we know the object type of each member? This can be   achieved by reading the ObjectClass property of the returned objects from   the Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet as shown in the following command:  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup  select Name, ObjectClass  [ 53 ]   As you can see in the following screenshot, the TestGroup security group has one  computer, one group, and a few users as members:  If you are only interested in users who are part of a given group, then you can adjust  the query as shown in the following command:  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup  ? {$_.ObjectClass -eq "User"      }  select Name  This command queries all members and returns the objects that have the object class  set to user, which means user objects. In the same way, the filter parameter can be  adjusted to return only computer accounts or groups.  If a security group holds another security group as a member, then how do we  know the recursive member's details? The Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet has a  switch parameter called Recursive, which can be used to query nested group  memberships, as shown in the following command:  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Recursive  select Name,      ObjectClass  As you can see in the following screenshot, a new member is now a part of  TestGroup, and TestGroup1, which was there earlier, does not appear in the   output anymore:  [ 54 ]   Since we used the Recursive switch while querying, it checks for group objects in  membership, queries their members, and displays the results. Even if the nested  group, TestGroup1, has other groups in its membership, the members of that group  will also be displayed when group membership is queried recursively.  Group membership of a security group can be easily exported to CSV  or Excel   using the Export-CSV cmdlet in PowerShell. All we need to do is just pass the output  of Get-ADGroupMember to this cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  Get-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup  select Name,      DistinguishedName,ObjectClass  Export-csv      c:\temp\GroupMembership.csv -NoTypeInformation  In the preceding example name, DN, and the object class of TestGroup members are  exported to a CSV file situated in the c:\temp folder. After export, the content of the  CSV file look like the following screenshot:  [ 55 ]   Removing members from an AD group As part of reconciliation activities, a system administrator may need to remove  members from security groups or users who have left the organization or moved to a  different department and no longer require access to a particular network resource  shared drive. These changes generally involve removing user accounts from a given  security group.  The Active Directory PowerShell module provides a cmdlet called Remove- ADGroupMember. Similar to the Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet, the Remove- ADGroupMember cmdlet also has two mandatory parameters: Identity and Members.  The Identity parameter takes the name of the group from which you want to  remove the members and the Members parameter takes the list of users, computers,  or group accounts that you want to remove.  The following sample command is used to remove a user account from a   security group:  Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members LabUser1  As you can see in the following screenshot, the Remove-ADGroupMember cmdlet  prompts for confirmation while removing an object from membership. This is just   a safety measure to make the system administrator verify his action and proceed  with it:  If you are sure about the action you are performing or you don't want to receive this  confirmation prompt, just pass the $false to the -Confirm parameter as shown in  the following command:  Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members LabUser1 -     Confirm:$false  [ 56 ]   This won't prompt for any confirmation and just proceeds with the operation. In the  preceding example, we removed a user object from the security group. To remove a  computer account from the security group, you can follow a similar approach and  pass the name of the computer account to the -Members parameter. You should  remember to suffix the computer name with the dollar sign  $  just as we did for  the Add-ADGroupMember cmdlet; otherwise, your removal will fail. The following  command removes the COMP1$ computer account from the security group:  Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity TestGroup -Members COMP1$ -     Confirm:$false  Removing a single user or computer account from a security group is easy, but how  do we perform this operation in bulk? Let's take a small example where you have  a list of user or computer names in the CSV file along with the group names from  which they should be removed. Now our task is to read the details from the CSV file  and remove the members accordingly. A sample CSV file looks like the following  screenshot. The object name is the name of the user or computer or group that   you want to remove. The object type represents what type of object you want   to remove and the third column holds the group name from which you want   to remove the object.  The following code processes the CSV file and performs the operations:  Import the CSV file into a variable $Removals = Import-CSV C:\temp\GroupRemovals.csv Loop through each entry in CSV file foreach $entry in $Removals  {     Read the group Name     $GroupName = $entry.GroupName     if Object type is Computer, then suffix it with $ sign     if $entry.ObjectType -eq "Computer"  {         $AccountToRemove = "{0}`$" -f $entry.ObjectName     } else {        $AccountToRemove = $entry.ObjectName     }  [ 57 ]   Write-Host "Removing a $ $entry.ObjectType  account with name      $AccountToRemove from $GroupName" Remove the account from Group Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity $GroupName -Members      $AccountToRemove -Confirm:$false }  Save the preceding code in a PS1 file and run it from PowerShell. You will see   an output similar to this. To run a PS1 file from PowerShell, you can give the full  path of the script as shown in the following screenshot or change to the folder   where you stored the PS1 file and then call it by prefixing with \  for example,   \ProcessRemovals.ps1 .  You can refer to the TechNet page at http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library bb613481%28v=vs.85%29. aspx to understand more about how to run PS1 scripts from the  PowerShell window.  The action showed in the output is self-explanatory. The code provided is also  supported with sufficient comments to understand what each statement is doing.  All it does is read the CSV file and store the data in an array. The code then loops  through each item in the array and processes the removal operations. If the entry   has a computer object, then it suffixes the dollar sign to the computer name so   that it completes the execution without any error.  Deleting a security group When a group is no longer required, it needs to be removed or deleted from Active  Directory in order to keep the database clean and up-to-date. Before performing the  delete operation, make sure it has no members inside it. If there are members and  this group is provisioned for any network resources access, then the user will face  problems. Once the group is deleted, it is difficult to revert the change unless you  have efficient restoration mechanisms in your environment. Also, performing such  restore operations is not straightforward and can be done only by specialists. Given  these reasons, it is important to ensure that there are no members in the group   before deletion.  [ 58 ]   A security group in Active Directory can be deleted using the Remove-ADGroup  cmdlet. Similar to removing group membership, deleting the group also prompts  for confirmation. It can be suppressed by using the same logic that we applied  while dealing with the Remove-ADGroupMember cmdlet, as shown in the following  command:  Remove-ADGroup -Identity TestGroup1 -Confirm:$false  Groups that need to be deleted can be searched using the Get-ADGroup cmdlet and  the output can be passed to the Remove-ADGroup cmdlet for deletion, as shown in   the following command:  Get-ADGroup -Filter "Name -like 'TestGroup*'"  Remove-ADGroup -     Confirm:$false  As shown in the following screenshot, Get-ADGroup returned a few groups when we  searched for groups starting with the string TestGroup:  All these groups are passed to Remove-ADGroup via a pipeline and with the  -Confirm option set to $false. This will delete all the security groups that have  names starting with TestGroup.  [ 59 ]   Summary Throughout this chapter, we saw various operations related to group membership  changes such as the addition and removal of Active Directory objects, which include  users, computers, and groups from security groups. The group management using  PowerShell resolves mostly around a handful of cmdlets such as Get-ADGroup,   Add-ADGroupMember, Remove-ADGroupMember, Set-ADGroup, and Remove-ADGroup.  Getting familiar with these cmdlets helps you perform group modifications   very easily.  In the next chapter, we will see how to manage Group Policies using PowerShell.  This is another important topic every system administrator should learn because  troubleshooting Group Policies is a daily job, and one should know how PowerShell  helps in simplifying these tasks.  [ 60 ]   Configuring Group Policies  We saw user, computer, and group object management in the previous chapters. This  chapter will take you through Group Policy Objects  GPO  management in Active  Directory. Group Policies are widely used in the Windows environment for several  purposes. Several user and computer settings can be managed and controlled in the  Windows domain environment using PowerShell.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:  Installing Group Policies       Querying Group Polices    Creating and linking Group Policies    Working with Group Policy permissions    Generating Resultant Set Of Policies    Removing Group Policy links and objects  We will explore various Group Policy operations such as creation, modification,  linking, enforcing, and searching for GPOs using PowerShell. Group Policies in  the Microsoft environment can be easily managed using Group Policy PowerShell  module. This module is available by default when a Windows Server 2008 R2  or later operating system is promoted to domain controller. This module can be  installed on a Windows Server 2008 R2 or on later member servers by installing  GPMC  Group Policy Management Console . This module can be made available  on client operating systems such as Windows 7 or later by installing Remove Server  Administration Tools  RSAT . It contains the GPMC installation, which in turn will  provide the Group Policy module.   Installing the Group Policy module Let's see how to install the GPMC console in Windows Server 2008 R2, which  includes the Group Policy PowerShell module as well. Like any other Windows feature, Group Policy Management can be installed  from Server Manager using the Add Features Wizard. Select the Group Policy  Management option, as shown in the following screenshot, to install the Group  Policy Management console as well as the Group Policy PowerShell module. Select  the aforementioned option and click Next in the wizard to complete the installation. Similarly, the console can be installed on Windows Server 2012 R2 and it works in a  similar way. From Server Manager, you need to add the Group Policy Management  option to install this feature as shown in the following screenshot:  Group Policy Management feature can be installed using PowerShell as well. To  check the current status of this feature installation, try the following command   in the PowerShell window:  Get-WindowsFeature -Name GPMC  [ 62 ]   As highlighted in the following screenshot, the cross mark under the Display Name  field indicates that the GPMC windows feature is installed. The Install State column   indicates the installation status:  If you find that the GPMC feature is not installed, then it can be installed using the  Add-WindowsFeature cmdlet in Server Manager module. This cmdlet takes the name  of the feature to be installed. Passing the value GPMC to the Name parameter will  install the GPMC feature automatically.  The Get-WindowsFeature cmdlet is part of the Server  Manager module. This module gets imported automatically  when you call this cmdlet in Windows Server 2012 or later.  However, in Windows Server 2008 R2, you need to explicitly  import the Server Manager module using the Import-Module  cmdlet to use Get-WindowsFeature. Another thing to note is  you might not see the Install State column when you execute  Get-WindowsFeature in Windows Server 2008 R2.  The installation takes a few minutes and the progress bar shows the progress. Once  the module is installed, you can start using it by importing the following command:  Import-Module GroupPolicy  You can view the list of cmdlets inside this module using the following command:  Get-Command -Module GroupPolicy  Running this code lists all the cmdlets available in the module. There are in all 28  cmdlets in this module; they can help us to perform various Group Policy-related  operations. The following table contains some of the frequently used cmdlets in the  Group Policy module; we will use them in further sections of this chapter:  Cmdlet Name New-GPO New-GPLink Remove-GPO  Description Creates a new Group Policy Object  GPO  Links an existing GPO to a site, domain, or OU Deletes Removes a GPO  [ 63 ]   Cmdlet Name Remove-GPLink Invoke-GPUpdate  Get-GPO Get-GPOReport Get- GPPermission s   Set-GPLink  Description Unlinks a GPO from a site, domain, or OU. This is available only in Windows 2012, Windows 8, or later  versions. Used to refresh Group Policy settings on remote  computers by scheduling and running the GPUpdate.exe  command on the computer. Fetches GP object information for the specified name. Generates reports in XML or HTML format for a specified GPO. The command is just a permission in Windows 2012 and  permissions in Windows 2008 R2. Gets permission levels for one  or more security principals for a specified GPO. Used to set properties such as Enabled Enforced Order for a  specified GPO link.  Querying Group Policies Active Directory in large environments contains policies ranging from a few tens to  hundreds in number, based on need and usage criteria. These policies will be linked  to multiple places in the Active Directory structure such as domains, OUs, and sites.  The Get-GPO cmdlet in the Group Policy module helps in querying the details of  Group Policies at various levels.  To see all Group Policies in the current forest, you can use the following command:  Get-GPO -All  By default, all the Group Policy cmdlets contact the Primary Domain Controller   PDC  emulator to get these results. If you want to query the details from the local  domain controller, you can pass the name of the domain controller with the -Server  parameter, using the following command:  Get-GPO -All -Server TIBDC2  Here, TIBDC2 is a domain controller in a local LAN. The output returned by this code  contains name, Global Unique Identifier  GUID , Creation-Time, Modification- Time, and other details.  If you want to see all the Group Policies modified in the last 24 hours, you can use  the following command:  $datetime =  Get-Date .AddHours -24   Get-GPO -All  ? {$_.Modificationtime -gt $datetime }  [ 64 ]   First, we will store the details of the last 24 hours in the $datetime variable by  passing the -24 value to the AddHours method of Get-Date. So, the $datetime  variable will contain the date and time details of the previous day. Later, we will be  comparing the Modification-Time of each GPO to see if it is modified after the   stored date. Look at the following screenshot for the sample output. If no GPOs   are modified in the last 24 hours, you will not see any results:  Similarly, if you want to list all the Group Policies linked to the given Organizational  Unit, the Get-GPO cmdlet can be used in following manner:  Import-Module ActiveDirectory $LinkedGPOs = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter 'Name -like      "*lab*"'  select -ExpandProperty LinkedGroupPolicyObjects $GUIDRegex = "{[a-zA-Z0-9]{8}[-][a-zA-Z0-9]{4}[-][a-zA-Z0-9]{4}[-     ][a-zA-Z0-9]{4}[-][a-zA-Z0-9]{12}}"  foreach $LinkedGPO in $LinkedGPOs  {     $result = [Regex]::Match $LinkedGPO,$GUIDRegex ;     if $result.Success  {         $GPOGuid = $result.Value.TrimStart "{" .TrimEnd "}"          Get-GPO -Guid $GPOGuid     } }  For the preceding code, refer to the following steps:  1.   In the preceding code, first we query the object of the given Organizational  Unit, with the name lab by the Get-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet and  storing the value of the LinkedGroupPolicyObjects property into the  $LinkedGPOs variable.  [ 65 ]   2.  You need to import the Active Directory module to make use of the    Get-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet. The output returned by this cmdlet  in the preceding code is an array of items that contains the details of Group  Policies linked to the given OU. The details returned by the cmdlet contain  the value of the gpLink attribute, if you check the properties of LAB OU  using Adsiedit.msc.  3.  Using a for loop, we loop through each link and extract the GUID of Group   Policy into a variable after trimming out the curly braces. Trimming the  braces is necessary as the Get-GPO cmdlet needs GUID without braces.  4.  Then pass the GUID to the Get-GPO cmdlet to get the details of the GPO.  You can also save the preceding code into a PS1 file and run it from the PowerShell  window. Remember the procedure for running PS1 files from a PowerShell window;  it will show the details of the Group Policies that are currently linked. As you can see  in the following screenshot, the LAB OU has two Group Policies linked to it and this  output matches the details that GPMC shows:  [ 66 ]   Refer to the following screenshot to understand this better:  Similarly, you can find Group Policies linked to any OU by just changing the filter   in the code. For example, you can query the GPOs linked to PROD OU by changing  the filter value of Get-ADOrganizationalUnit in the previous code, as shown in the  following command:  $LinkedGPOs = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter 'Name -like "PROD"'       select -ExpandProperty LinkedGroupPolicyObjects  Group Policies can be linked to the domain level as well as the site level. To  view the Group Policies linked to the domain level, parse the value of the  LinkedGroupPolicyObjects property returned by the Get-ADDomain cmdlet.   The following command helps you to fetch the GPOs linked to domain level:  Get-ADDomain   select LinkedGroupPolicyObjects  More about the format in which GPO details are stored in the gpLink attribute is  available at http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library cc232505.aspx.  Creating and linking Group Policies So far, we have seen how to query the existing Group Policies using the Active  Directory and Group Policy modules. Now, let's check how to create a new policy   in Active Directory and link it to Organizational Units using PowerShell code.  To do this, we mainly need two cmdlets:     New-GPO: This will help in creating the Group Policies    New-GPLink: This will help in creating links to existing OUs, domains,    and sites  To create a new GPO, we just need to pass the name of the GPO to the New-GPO  cmdlet and it returns the GPO object details after creating the new GPO. The  following command creates a new GPO with the name MyNewGPO:  New-GPO -Name "MyNewGPO"  [ 67 ]   It should look like following screenshot:  When a new GPO is created, it does not get linked to any OUs or domains by  default. It just stays in the Group Policy objects container in the GPMC console. After  creating the GPO, it has to be linked to any of the existing OUs and this can be done  by using the New-GPLink cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  New-GPLink -Name "MyNewGPO" -Target "OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD"  When the preceding code is executed, it returns the results that contain details   about link enable status, the order number of the GPO, enforcement status, and   so on, as shown in the following screenshot:  By default, the GPO link is enabled during the link creation process. If you want   the link to be disabled, then pass a value No to the -LinkEnabled parameter of   the New-GPLink cmdlet during the creation process. Similarly, you can control   the enforcement status by the -Enforced parameter and the order of the GPO   by the -Order parameter.  [ 68 ]   The following command creates a new GPO link at groups OU with default link  status disabled and enforcement enabled:  New-GPLink -Name "MyNewGPO" -Target      "OU=Groups,OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD" -LinkEnabled No -Enforced yes  After running this command, you can verify the result using the GPMC console, which  shows that the newly linked policy at groups OU will have the link disabled and  Enforced is set to Yes. Look at the following screenshot to understand this better:  From Windows Server 2008 onwards Microsoft has introduced a new concept  in Group Policies, which is starter Group Policies. Starter Group Policy is like a  template where you preconfigure certain settings and values. Any new Group Policy  created from this starter GPO will contain the pre-defined settings in the starter GPO.  Starter GPOs in Active Directory can be created using the New-GPStarterGPO cmdlet  as shown in the following command:  New-GPStarterGPO -Name "TIB-StarterGPO"  After the creation of the starter GPO, add some settings to it and save it. These  settings can be something you want by default whenever you create a new   GPO. Once the starter GPO is created and saved, you can use it as a template and  create new GPOs from the starter GPO. The new GPOs will contain the default  settings you already configured in the starter GPO. Please refer to the TechNet  page at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library cc753200.aspx to  understand starter GPOs better.  The following command shows how to create a new GPO from an existing   starter GPO:  New-GPO -Name "First GPO" -StarterGpoName "TIB-StarterGPO  In the next sections, we will see how to modify existing GPOs and GPO link objects.  [ 69 ]   Working with links, enforcements, and  order of GPOs While learning about searching for Group Policies in previous sections, you have  seen how to query GPOs linked to a given OU. When a GPO is linked to an OU,  Link Enable is set to NO and Enforced is also set to NO. These are defaults; however,  it is possible that some of the users might change these values over a period of time  based on their needs. For example, the link might be enabled, enforcement might be  enabled, and many more functions similar to this. So, how do we find these details  using PowerShell so that we can find the exact status of Group Policies linked to an  OU? The following function will help in finding this information. This function queries the specified OU for a list of GPOs linked, their Link  Enable status, enforcement status, and the link order of GPOs. You can refer  to the TechNet page at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library  hh147307%28v=ws.10%29.aspx to understand these GPO parameters better:  function Get-GPOLinkStatus { [cmdletbinding  ] param    [string]$OUName   $OUs = @ Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter * -Properties gPlink  ?      {$_.Name -eq "$OUName"}  Return if no OUs found with given name if !$OUs  { Write-Warning "No such OU found"; return }  foreach $OU in $OUs  {  $OUName = $OU.Name  $OUDN = $OU.DistinguishedName  Hackey way to get LDAP strings. Regex might be best option here  $OUGPLinks = $OU.gPlink.split "]["   Get rid of all empty entries the array  $OUGPLinks =  @ $OUGPLinks  ? {$_}   $order = $OUGPLinks.count;  foreach $GpLink in $OUGPLinks  {   $GpName = [adsi]$GPlink.split ";" [0]  select -ExpandProperty      displayName   $GpStatus = $GPlink.split ";" [1]   $EnableStatus = $EnforceStatus = 0   switch $GPStatus  {     "1" {$EnableStatus = $false; $EnforceStatus = $false}     "2" {$EnableStatus = $true; $EnforceStatus = $true}  [ 70 ]       "3" {$EnableStatus = $false; $EnforceStatus = $true}     "0" {$EnableStatus = $true; $EnforceStatus = $false}   }   $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSobject   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name OUName -     Value $OUName   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name OUDN -     Value $OUDN   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name GPName -     Value $GPName   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name IsLinked      -Value $EnableStatus   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name      IsEnforced -Value $EnforceStatus   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name GPOrder      -Value $Order    $OutputObj     $order--  } } }  Copy and paste this code into the PowerShell window where you have imported   the Active Directory as well as Group Policy modules, and then query the status   of GPOs linked to an OU, using the following command:  Get-GPOLinkStatus -OUName LAB  ft -AutoSize  This command will query the GPO link status at the LAB OU and return the  details. As you can see in the following screenshot, the LogonPolicy of the IsLink  column is enabled, and IsEnforced is set to False and has the order 2. The Get- GPOLinkStatus command we used here is nothing but the function we copied to a  PowerShell window in the previous section, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 71 ]   This output is the same as what you see in the GPMC console. In the following  screenshot, you can notice that both the Group Policies have Link Enabled set   to Yes and Enforced set to No. Also, the Link Order column you see in GPMC  matches the GPO order shown in the preceding output screenshot.  Once we know the link status, we might want to alter some information. For  example, if we want to disable the link of LogonPolicy at LAB OU, the following  command can be used:  Set-GPLink -Name "LogonPolicy" -Target "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=AD" -     LinkEnabled No  This sets the Link Enable status to No for LogonPolicy GPO at LAB OU. Similarly, enforcement of a policy can be changed using the following command:  Set-GPLink -Name "LogonPolicy" -Target "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=AD"      Enforced yes  Changing the order of the policy works in a similar way, as shown by the   following command:  Set-GPLink -Name "LogonPolicy" -Target "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=AD" -     Order 1  After the making the preceding changes, now the GPO's link status at LAB OU   looks like the following screenshot. You can clearly notice that the LogonPolicy of  the IsLink column is disabled, IsEnforced is enabled and the order changed to 1 in  the following screenshot:  [ 72 ]   In a similar way, the GPO's link status at domain level and site level can be changed  using the Set-GPLink cmdlet. The only thing you need to do is just pass the DN of  the domain or site to the -Target parameter.  Working with Group Policy permissions System administrators often need to work with Group Policy permissions.  Sometimes, we modify Group Policy permissions to deploy the GPO settings to new  users computers groups. Similarly, we modify permissions to allow other teams to  manage the Group Policy. These operations are easy if you are granting permissions  to one or two users on a single GPO; however, as the volume increases, it is difficult   to perform this manually and automation makes things easy in this case.  The Group Policy module has two cmdlets that can ease Group Policy permission  management. They are as follows:     Get-GPPermission: This is used to query the permissions that are set    on a GPO     Set-GPPermission: This is used to apply a new set of permissions or modify   existing permissions on a GPO  If you are trying to query GPO permissions from a Windows  Server 2008 or later, use the Get-GPPermissions and Set- GPPermissions cmdlets. Notice the additional 's' at the end of these  cmdlets. In Windows Server 2012 and later, the Get-GPPermissions  and Set-GPPermissions commands will work but they are  aliases to the Get-GPPermission and Set-GPPermission  cmdlets. Hence, the cmdlet names are used in this section instead of  aliases. Microsoft has removed the letter "s" from both the cmdlets  in Windows Server 2012 because they are not in compliance with  cmdlet naming conventions. You might want to refer to the MSDN  page at http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library  dd878270%28v=vs.85%29.aspx for cmdlet naming guidelines.  Querying GPO permissions This section will help you to understand how to query Group Policy permissions  using the Get-GPPermission cmdlet. We need to pass either the name or GUID of  the GPO for which we want to query permissions. Also, we need to specify a target  object name when we want to verify what kind of permissions it has on the GPO. If  you don't know the target name, then you can use the -All parameter to return all  the permissions on the given GPO. Note that, without the -All or -TargetName and  -TargetType parameter, the cmdlet will result in failures.  [ 73 ]   We can get the current permissions of a given GPO using the following command.  As you can notice, we are using an -All parameter to retrieve the complete  permissions list of this GPO:  Get-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -All  This command lists all permissions configured on MyNewGPO. However, if you are  interested in permissions that domain administrators have, you can alter the query.  As you can see, we have passed domain admins to the TargetName parameter and  we have specified that the target we provided is a group by passing it to TargetType  using the following command:  Get-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -TargetName "Domain Admins" -     TargetType Group  Similarly, you can query the permissions assigned to any user or computer by  specifying the name of the user or computer account with the TargetName parameter  and by passing object type to the TargetType parameter.  Look at the following example command, where we are fetching the permissions  assigned to the LabUser1 user account on MyNewGPO:  Get-GPPermission -Name MyNewGPO -TargetName LabUser1 -TargetType User  These permissions can be exported to Excel as well in CSV format using the   following command:  Get-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -All   export-csv      c:\temp\MyNewGPO-Perms.csv -NoTypeInformation  Modifying GPO permissions To modify the GPO permission, we can use the Set-GPPermission cmdlet.  It requires the TargetName and TargetType parameter to be added as the  parameters to process permissions. Along with these, we also need to provide the  -PermissionLevel parameter. The valid permission levels are: GpoRead, GpoApply,  GpoEdit, GpoEditDeleteModifySecurity, or None. The valid GPO permission  levels are as follows:     To grant a group GPO read permissions, we can use the following command:  Set-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -TargetName TestGroup -     TargetType Group -PermissionLevel GpoRead  [ 74 ]       If you change your mind and want to adjust the permissions to GPOApply  instead of GPORead, you can do this using the -Replace switch, with the   help of the following command: Set-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -TargetName TestGroup -     TargetType Group -PermissionLevel GpoApply -Replace     You can verify the status of execution by running Get-GPPermission using   the following command: Get-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -TargetName "TestGroup" -     TargetType Group  As you can see in the following screenshot, TestGroup has GpoApply permission on  MyNewGPO object:  Similarly, if you want to remove permission for TestGroup on the GPO,   then just change the -PermissionLevel parameter to None as shown by the  following command:  Set-GPPermission -Name "MyNewGPO" -TargetName TestGroup -TargetType      Group -PermissionLevel None  You can use a similar approach to grant permissions to users or computer accounts  on a GPO by changing -TargetType to user or computer.  Updating Group Policy and generating  Resultant Set of Policy So far, we have seen operations related to Group Policy objects such as creation  and modifications. Now, let's see how to apply these GPOs and find out the Group  Policy's update status.  [ 75 ]   Remotely triggering Group Policy update Group Policy update on a system can be triggered on a computer using the   gpupdate.exe utility. The Invoke-GPUpdate cmdlet in the Group Policy module  functions the same way and also allows triggering of GP update on computers  remotely. This cmdlet can be used to trigger computer or user policy update  selectively and also provides options to control, reboot, or logoff after the   GPO process.  Note: The Invoke-GPUpdate cmdlet is available on Windows Server  2012 Windows 8 and later only. However, you can use this cmdlet from  Windows Server 2012 Windows 8 or later to trigger Group Policy update  on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows 7.  The following command can trigger synchronous Group Policy update on   TIB-WIN8PC remotely:  Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer TIB-WIN8PC -Sync  By default, the preceding command will not cause reboot or logoff of the remote  computer unless you specify either one of the -Boot or -Logoff switches, as shown  by the following command:  Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer TIB-WIN8PC -Sync -Boot -Target Computer  This command triggers the computer Group Policy update and forces a reboot   after processing, if any of the GPO Client Side Extensions  CSE  requires a reboot   to complete the GPO processing.  Similarly, logoff can be allowed with the -Logoff switch using the following  command:  Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer TIB-WIN8PC -Sync -Target user -LogOff  If you have a list of computers where you want to trigger GP update, you can use the  following command: Get-Content c:\temp\comps.txt  % { Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer $_ -     Sync }  Also, if you want to trigger GP update on all computers in an OU, you can do this  using the following command: Get-ADComputer -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,dc=ad"  % {      Invoke-GPUpdate -Computer $_.Name -Sync }  This queries all computers in LAB OU and triggers GP updates on them.  [ 76 ]   Collecting RSOP data remotely Resultant Set Of Policies  RSOP  output shows which policies are applied for a user  or computer, if any policies are denied or not applied, what is the reason for it, when  the policies are applied, and other details.  The Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy cmdlet helps to find this information. It queries  remote computer for RSOP data and generates a report in HTML or XML format.  By default, it queries the computer's RSOP information; if a user account's RSOP  information is needed then the name of the user should be passed to the -User  parameter as shown in the following command:  Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy -Computer TIB-Win8PC -ReportType HTML -     Path c:\temp\TIB-WIN8PCReport.html  To include a user account's RSOP data in the output, add the -user parameter and  pass the name of the user as shown in the following command:  Get-GPResultantSetOfPolicy -Computer TIB-Win8PC -ReportType HTML -     Path c:\temp\TIB-WIN8PCReport.html -User techibee.ad\testuser1  These commands save the RSOP results in HTML format in the c:\temp folder with  the given name. This HTML will contain information related to a list of applicable  GPOs, their apply status, any errors that occurred during the GPO processing,   and so on.  The XML report type is useful when you want to collect the RSOP data and process  it further programmatically to find certain information. For general analysis, the  HTML format is sufficient and is much more readable.  Removing Group Policy links and objects It is good to remove Group Policy objects and their links when they are no longer  in use. Otherwise, it will create additional confusion while reviewing the policies  through GPMC UI tools and also analyzing the GP result output from such  environments is time-consuming as the computers and users have to process policies  that are just linked to an OU but doesn't apply any policy to an object in particular.  The Group Policy module provides two cmdlets for this cleanup work, namely  Remove-GPO and Remove-GPLink. As their names indicate, their purpose is to   remove Group Policy and its links from an OU, domain, or site as shown by the  following command:  Remove-GPO LogonPolicy  [ 77 ]   This command deletes the LogonPolicy GPO from the Group Policies store and  also deletes links from OUs where it was linked. Use this approach when you are  completely retiring the particular GPO from your environment. Removing a GPO  causes its data to get deleted from the SYSVOL share folder and related objects in  Active Directory will get deleted as well. So, be sure to choose this option as the  restoration of GPOs is not straightforward like other Active Directory objects.  Say, for example, you want to delete the link of a GPO from a particular OU but  not the GPO itself, then you can use the Remove-GPLink cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:  Remove-GPLink -Name MyNewGPO -Target "OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  The preceding command unlinks the MyNewGPO from PROD OU. You can read more  details about these cmdlets by querying their help content using the Get-Help cmdlet.  Summary In this chapter, you have learned about a new module, Group Policy, and how to use  it to perform some of the GPO related operations. We covered topics starting from  creation of GPOs, modifying them, linking them, working with other options such   as enforcement, working with permissions for the removal of GPOs and their links.  We also covered RSOP generation, which is a very common and frequent task  for any level of system administrator; using automation in this area saves time  significantly as the operations can be done remotely without interacting with the   end user.  In the next chapter, we will look into management of Organizational Units, domains,  trusts, and sites with PowerShell in detail. There, you will understand how to create  OUs, sites, and subnets. You will also learn about how to query domain details and  domain controller details of a domain or forest.  [ 78 ]   Managing Domains,  Organizational Units, Sites,  and Subnets  We have discussed about managing various Active Directory objects  such as users,  computers, groups, and so on.  using PowerShell in previous chapters. Active  Directory administration will not end with managing just users and computers. As  an Active Directory administrator, one needs to manage several core components of  Active Directory such as domains, trusts, sites, subnets, Organizational Units, and   so on.  In this chapter, we will focus on the following:     Querying forest and domain details    Managing Organizational Units    Working with sites and subnets  Managing domains Most small organizations comprise only one domain in their environment where all  users, computers, and other resources are created and managed. These are called  single-forest, single-domain environments. However, in large scale organizations,  there might be a complex environment containing several forests, each forest  containing several domains with different types of trusts across domains and forests.  In this section, you will learn to query these details using PowerShell.   Active Directory module has several cmdlets that can help in querying the forest and  domain details. To get the list of cmdlets that work with a domain or forest, run the  following commands after importing the Active Directory module:  Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory -Name *Domain*  Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory -Name *Forest*  Each of the previous commands will return a bunch of cmdlets, that you can go  through and understand in-depth. In this section, we will be using some of these  cmdlets to query forests, domain, domain controllers, and other details.  Querying forest and domain details Forests and domains are high-level logical entities in Active Directory. We can get  the details of the current domain using the Get-ADDomain cmdlet. Running the  following command without any parameters will return the current domain details:  Get-ADDomain  The previous command will return details such as the DNS name of the domain, the  NetBIOS name, default container details of users, computers, deleted objects, child  domains, parent domain details, Group Policy Objects  GPOs  linked at the domain  level, domain mode, and much more. Try this command in your lab setup to check  the details that it returns.   Similarly, the Get-ADForest command will return details about the forest from  PowerShell to the server or domain controller you are running from. Look at the  following output where Get-ADForest retrieved details about current forest details:  PS C:\> Get-ADForest  ApplicationPartitions : {DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=techibee,DC=ad,      DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=techibee,DC=ad}  CrossForestReferences : {}  DomainNamingMaster    : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  Domains               : {sales.techibee.ad, techibee.ad}  ForestMode            : Windows2012Forest  GlobalCatalogs        : {WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad,      TIBDC2.techibee.ad}  Name                  : techibee.ad  PartitionsContainer   :      CN=Partitions,CN=Configuration,DC=techibee,DC=ad  RootDomain            : techibee.ad  SchemaMaster          : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  [ 80 ]   Sites                 : {DEFAULT, SNG, INDIA}  SPNSuffixes           : {}  UPNSuffixes           : {}  PS C:\>  This will help you to understand current forest configuration details, such as a list of  domains and sites in the current forest, forest level operation master roles, and other  similar details.  Querying domain controller details Domain Controllers  DCs  are the actual servers that hold domain information  and replicate the data among themselves. DC details can be queried using the Get- ADDomainController cmdlet, which can get the details of a Domain Controller when  the name or any other identity is provided; it is also capable of getting the DC that  matches given criteria.  Now, let's see the details of a domain controller named TIBDC2 using the   following command:  Get-ADDomainController -Identity TIBDC2  The following screenshot shows the list of details returned by the cmdlet when  queried by a DC directly by identity:  [ 81 ]   You can find all domain controllers in the current domain using the following  command:  Get-ADDomainController -Filter *  select Hostname  All domain controllers in the current forest can be listed using the following piece   of code:  function Get-DCDetails { [cmdletbinding  ] $Domains =  Get-ADForest .Domains foreach $Domain in $Domains  {     $DCs = Get-ADDomainController -Filter * -Server $Domain foreach  $DC in $DCs  {         $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSobject   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name DCName -     Value $DC.HostName   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name SITE -     Value $DC.SITE   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name Domain -     Value $Domain.ToUpper     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name IsGC -     Value $DC.IsGlobalCatalog   $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name IsRODC -     Value $DC.IsReadOnly   $OutputObj     } } }  This is a simple PowerShell function, that you can copy and paste into PowerShell;  you can then call the function by its name.  Running the preceding code will return the name of the Domain Controller, the  domain to which it belongs, and the name of the site where the Domain Controller  currently resides. This also tells us whether a given DC is a global catalog sever or  not and whether it is a Read-Only Domain Controller  RODC  or not. This is   shown in the following screenshot:  [ 82 ]   View the help content of Get-ADDomainController to know more use cases. You  can get help using the following command:  Get-Help Get-ADDomainController -Full  This command will display details of each parameter that the cmdlet takes and some  of the example codes.  Querying flexible single-master operation role  owners You might have already noticed that Get-ADDomain and Get-ADForest cmdlet  outputs have details about the FSMO role owners. The first one will display domain  level roles when the domain name is passed to the -Server parameter and, similarly  the second one returns forest level roles. So, getting the FSMO role owner details   of a given domain is a matter of parsing the output from these two cmdlets for a  given domain.  There are several ways to query FSMO roles and the following query is one of them.  It is a simple PowerShell function, that you can copy and paste to a PowerShell  window; you can then call it by name with the -DomainName parameter.  Function Get-FSMORoles { [cmdletbinding  ] param      [Parameter Mandatory=$true ]     [string]$DomainName   try {     $DomainObj = Get-ADDomain -Server $DomainName -EA Stop     $ForestObj = Get-ADForest -Server $DomainName -EA Stop     $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSobject     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        PDCEmulator -Value $DomainObj.PDCEmulator     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        RIDMaster -Value $DomainObj.RIDMaster     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        InfrastructureMaster -Value $DomainObj.InfrastructureMaster     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        SchemaMaster -Value $ForestObj.SchemaMaster     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name       DomainNamingMaster -Value $ForestObj.DomainNamingMaster     $OutputObj  [ 83 ]   } catch {     Write-Warning "Failed to get Domain details. Verify that it is        valid domain Name" } }  Calling this function is very simple. You can pass the domain name and call it as  shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Get-FSMORoles -DomainName sales.techibee.ad PDCEmulator          : TIBDC3.sales.techibee.ad RIDMaster            : TIBDC3.sales.techibee.ad InfrastructureMaster : TIBDC3.sales.techibee.ad SchemaMaster         : TIBDC2.techibee.ad DomainNamingMaster   : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  PS C:\> Get-FSMORoles -DomainName techibee.ad PDCEmulator          : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad RIDMaster            : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad InfrastructureMaster : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad SchemaMaster         : TIBDC2.techibee.ad DomainNamingMaster   : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  PS C:\> Get-FSMORoles -DomainName dummy.techibee.ad WARNING: Failed to get Domain details. Verify that it is valid domain      Name PS C:\>  As you will notice in the preceding output, the Get-FSMORoles command returned  the FMSO roles for domains. This command is also capable of printing a warning  message when the given domain name is not found.  Managing Organizational Units Organizational Units  OUs  are used for grouping various Active Directory objects  so that they can be managed easily. In this section, we will look at some of the Active  Directory operations related to OUs using PowerShell.  The majority of operations on OUs can be performed using four cmdlets in Active  Directory, they are Get-ADOrganizationalUnit, New-ADOrganizationalUnit,  Set-ADOrganizationalUnit, and Remove-ADOrganizationalUnit. As their names  indicate, they are available to perform designated operations. Now, let's look at the  usage of these cmdlets by performing some sample operations.  [ 84 ]   Searching for OUs In Chapter 4, Configuring Group Policies, we used the Get-ADOrganizationalUnit  cmdlet to get the group policies linked on a given OU. So, from that example, and by  looking at the name of the cmdlet, it is clear that this cmdlet can be used to retrieve  details of OUs in Active Directory. We can retrieve all kinds of details about an OU  using this cmdlet except the objects under the OU.  All OU names in a domain can be queried using the Get-ADOrganizationalUnit  cmdlet:  Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter *  select Name  The -Filter parameter works in exact way explained in the Searching and modifying  group object information section of Chapter 3, Working with Active Directory Groups and  Memberships where we discussed querying AD groups. To query all groups that  match a particular string, the -Filter parameter can be updated, as shown in the  following command:  Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter {Name -like "*Servers*" }  This command returns all the OUs that have the string servers in their name. Like  other AD cmdlets, this one also returns a few properties by default and if you wish  see other properties, you can either pass the asterisk  *  symbol to the -Properties  parameter or the name of the property if you know it in advance, as shown in the  following commands:  Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter {Name -like "*Servers*" } -     Properties *  Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter {Name -like "*Servers*" } -     Properties Name, CreateTimeStamp, ModifyTimeStamp  The first command in the preceding example displays all properties of an OU object  and the second one displays the name, Creation-Time, and Modification-Time  properties of the OU. We can also get the properties of an OU using its Distinguished  Name  DN  by passing the DN value to the -Identity parameter using the   following command:  Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  The previous result can be achieved by a native method, mentioned in the first chapter.  This native method uses Active Directory Service Interface  ADSI  adapter to query  the Active Directory. ADSI is the accelerator of the System.DirectoryServices. DirectoryEntry .Net class as shown in the following command:  [ADSI]"LDAP:  OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  fl *  [ 85 ]   Running the preceding command returns all the properties of LAB OU. You can see  this in the following screenshot:  You might see some changes in property names returned by   Get-ADOrganizationalUnit and the [ADSI] accelerator. This is because the cmdlet  returns the property names in a format that is more user understandable, whereas the  [ADSI] accelerator returns the actual attribute names that you see in the adsiedit. msc GUI tool. Look at the following screenshot taken from ADSI editor for LAB OU:  [ 86 ]   [ADSI] accelerator is useful when you know the exact DN of the OU that you want to  query. Otherwise, use the Get-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet, which is capable of  querying the Active Directory by searching for a given OU name. It is also capable of  querying OU details by taking a DN as input. This cmdlet can be used to find child OUs of a given OU. For example, techibee.ad  lab has an OU called Prod, that has three OUs, as shown in the following screenshot:  The child OUs of Prod OU can be queried using the following command:  Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter * -SearchBase  "OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -SearchScope 1  select Name ,  DistinguishedName  As you can see in the previous screenshot, the command returned the same OUs that  you saw in the GUI. In this case, we passed LAB OU DistinguishedName as the search  base and restricted the search to one level by passing 1 to the SearchScope parameter.  If you want to query all nested OUs inside the LAB OU, you can do this by changing  the SearchScope to 2 or by completely removing the SearchScope parameter.  [ 87 ]   Creating OUs OUs can be created using the New-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet. The name of   the OU is a mandatory parameter for this cmdlet. When this cmdlet is used with  just the -Name parameter, it creates the OU at the root of the domain. The following  example creates a new OU called Australia Users inside the LAB OU with the  City property set to Sydney; and the specified description will be added as well,   as shown in the following command:  New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Australia Users" -Path      "OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -City Sydney -Description "All user      accounts of Australia are inside this OU" -     ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false -PassThru  The output in the following screenshot shows that the values we passed to the   New-ADOrganizationalUnit are reflected in the OU entry that is created:  One thing you might notice is the ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion parameter  that is set to $false. The value of this parameter controls whether protection should  be enabled on the newly created OU or not. Starting from Active Directory 2008 R2,  a new feature was introduced to prevent accidental deletion or movement of Active  Directory Organization Units. This feature is enabled by default on every new OU  that you create using Active Directory 2008. So, this is intentionally set to $false   so that it gets highlighted and you know that it exists.  You can enable or disable this protection feature by accessing the properties of an  OU object with Active Directory Users and Computers  ADUC  using Microsoft  Management Console  MMC .The following screenshot shows the status of  protection on the new OU that we just created:  [ 88 ]   This protection can be enabled or disabled by PowerShell as well; however, we will  focus on this when we discuss modifying OUs.  Modifying OUs The possible changes that we can make to an OU that include changing its name,  city, country, description, managed by, and other properties that you can see in the  General tab of OU properties in ADUC using MMC. The General tab of Australia  Users that we just created is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 89 ]   Now, let's start working on updating these properties using the   Set-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet. Before we start modifying the properties  of this OU, let's query this object from Active Directory and store it in a variable.  Further modifications to this object are made using the following command:  $AusOU = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter "Name -eq 'Australia      Users'"  You have already learned in the previous section about the   Get-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet, so you know what it does. The $AusOU  property will contain the reference to the Australia Users OU that we want to  modify using the following command:   Set-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity $AusOU -Description "New      Description added by Set-ADOrganizationalUnit"  The preceding command modifies the description of the OU. As you can   see, the OU object variable is passed to the -Identity parameter of the   Set-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet. Similarly, the following command   updates the City property to Melbourne from Sydney:  Set-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity $AusOU -City "Melbourne"  Country can be updated to Australia in a similar way but the catch here is that it  accepts only the two-character country or region code that you want to set. Refer to  ISO 3166  http:  www.iso.org iso country_codes.htm  for the list of country  codes. As per the aforementioned, the country code for Australia is AU as shown in  the following command:  Set-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity $AusOU -Country AU  The postal code number also can be added in a similar way using the following  command   Set-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity $AusOU -PostalCode 3004  After making all the previous changes, let's see how the properties of the Australia  Users OU look. The following screenshot clearly shows that all the changes we made  via PowerShell are now visible from ADUC:  [ 90 ]   The protection feature we talked about earlier can also be turned ON or OFF in a  similar way:  Set-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity $AusOU -     ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $true  The previous command enables protection on the OU. To disable it, just change the  value of the ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion parameter to $false from $true.  Renaming, moving, and deleting OUs So far, we have seen how to update the properties of the OU object. Now, let's see  how to rename an OU object using PowerShell. We can use the Rename-ADObject  cmdlet for this purpose, as follows:  Rename-ADObject -Identity $AusOU -NewName AustraliaUsers-New  The previous command renames the AustraliaUsers OU to AustraliaUsers–New.  [ 91 ]   Active Directory OU can be moved from one place to another in the AD logical  structure using the Move-ADObject cmdlet. Before you attempt this, be sure to get  the object of OU that you want to move. Here, we are not using the same $ausOU  variable because we just renamed it. So, we should obtain a fresh reference from AD.  To do this, run the same command again but with the new OU name, as shown:  $AusOU = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter "Name -eq      'AustraliaUsersnew'"  After this is done, use the Move-ADObject command to move it to a new location:  Move-ADObject -Identity $AusOU -TargetPath      "OU=PROD,dc=techibee,dc=ad"  You might get an Access Denied message while moving or deleting an  Organizational Unit though you are a domain administrator. This is  because of the protection feature that is explained earlier. So, be sure to  disable this feature before attempting to move or delete.  OUs can be deleted using the Remove-ADOrganizationalUnit cmdlet. Since  deletion of an OU is a sensitive operation, this cmdlet prompts for confirmation  before deletion. It can be suppressed by setting the -Confirm parameter to $false:  Remove-ADOrganizationalUnit -Identity $AusOU -Confirm:$false  With this, we have completed management of Organizational Units using PowerShell.  Managing sites and subnets Sites and subnets play a critical role in controlling authentication traffic and  replication traffic in the Active Directory environment. In the same way we managed  several logical components of Active Directory, these physical components also can  be managed. However, there are no cmdlets available directly in Active Directory  module to create and modify sites and subnets such as New-ADSite, Set-ADSite,  and so on. We need to write a piece of code to query these objects using the   Get-ADObject cmdlet and modify using the Set-ADObject cmdlet.  Querying sites and subnets Sites and subnets are part of Configuration Naming Context  CNC  in Active  Directory. By default, the Active Directory cmdlets query the domain naming context  where the data of users, computers, groups, and OUs is stored. So, we need to tell the  cmdlets to look at CNC to query sites and subnets.  [ 92 ]   First, we need to get the DN of the CNC partition, so that we can make use of it  further in our code, as follows:  $ConfigNC= Get-ADRootDSE .ConFigurationNamingContext  As shown in the following screenshot, the $ConfigNC cmdlet will now contain the  DN of CNC:  Now, we can query for site objects using the Get-ADObject cmdlet by passing the  DN of Configuration Naming context to SearchBase:  Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "Site" } -SearchBase $ConfigNC  This displays the name of the site, the DN, object class and Globally Unique  Identifier  GUID  of the sites, as shown in the following screenshot:  The -Filter parameter of Get-ADObject can be tuned to search for a particular site,  as shown in the following command:  Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "Site" -and Name -eq "INDIA"} -     SearchBase $ConfigNC  This command will return only that site object that has the name INDIA.  Now, if, for example, you are interested in querying all domain controllers in the  given site, we can get the site object using the previous command and further use it  to get the domain controllers list:  $ConfigNC=   Get-ADRootDSE .ConFigurationNamingContext  $SiteObj = Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "Site" -and Name -eq      "INDIA"} -SearchBase $ConfigNC  Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "Server" } -SearchBase      $SiteObj.DistinguishedName  [ 93 ]   This returns the list of domain controllers in the INDIA site. The output includes  names of the DC, DN, and the GUID, as we can see in the following screenshot:  There is a script available in Chapter 9, Miscellaneous Scripts and Resources for Further  Learning, that helps you to list all domain controllers and their site details in one go. Just as we queried sites, subnets also can be queried using the Get-ADObject cmdlet:  $ConfigNC=   Get-ADRootDSE .ConFigurationNamingContext  $SiteObj = Get-ADObject -Filter {ObjectClass -eq "Site" -and Name -eq      "INDIA"} -SearchBase $ConfigNC -Properties *  $SiteObj.siteObjectBL  As you can see in the preceding code, while querying for the site name that matches  the string INDIA, the Get-ADObject cmdlet is requested to return all properties of  the found objects. One of the properties of the returned site objects is siteObjectBL,  which is a backlink object that stores the DN of subnets that are currently mapped   to the site.  If you want to see the properties of any of these returned subnets, you can use   Get-ADObject, as shown in the following command:  Get-ADObject -Identity "CN=192.168.0.0 24,CN=Subnets,CN=Sites,     CN=Configuration,DC=techibee,DC=ad" -Properties *  Active Directory module has a cmdlet, Get-ADReplicationSite, that can   help in querying the site details without much hassle. However, we have used   Get-ADObject extensively in this section to query sites, so that you can understand  how to query any type of object when there are no direct cmdlets available. Similarly,  subnet details can be queried using the Get-ADReplicationSubnet cmdlet.  Creating and modifying sites In the previous section, we have seen how to query existing sites and their details.  This section talks about creating new sites and modifying their properties. New sites  in Active Directory can be created easily using the New-ADReplicationSite cmdlet  and modifications can be done using Set-ADReplicationSite.  [ 94 ]   Note: These cmdlets are available only in windows 2012 R2  and Windows 8.1  A new site in the existing environment can be easily created using the New- ADReplicationSite cmdlet. Name is a mandatory parameter for this cmdlet and  there are a good number of optional parameters that help in setting different  configuration parameters of the site, as shown in the following command:  New-ADReplicationSite -Name US01  You can enable protection, set Inter-Site Topology Generator  ISTG , enable  universal group membership caching, and many other options at the time  of creation. The following command enables protection and universal group  membership caching on the site while creating it:  New-ADReplicationSite -Name US01 -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $true   -UniversalGroupCachingEnabled $true  You can refer to the TechNet page at http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library hh852286.aspx to  read more about the available options.  To modify the configuration of an already existing site, the Set-ADReplicationSite  cmdlet can be used. Several configuration parameters of the site object  and NTDS  settings  can be modified using the following cmdlet:  Set-ADReplicationSite -Identity US01 -Description "Site created for  United States" -UniversalGroupCachingEnabled $false -PassThru  This command adds a description to the site object and disables universal group  caching for this site, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 95 ]   Creating and modifying subnets Subnets in Active Directory can be created using the New-ADReplicationSubnet  cmdlet, much as we created the site. The -Name parameter to subnet should be in  the network bits masked format. For example, 172.16.10.0 24. The other optional  parameters that can be provided to this cmdlet are site and description. The site is  the name of the Active Directory site to which this subnet should be mapped by  using the following command:  New-ADReplicationSubnet -Name "172.16.10.0 24" -Site US01 -Description  "New IP range in NewYark" -PassThru  The -PassThru parameter helps in viewing the new object that is created after  executing the command, as shown in the following screenshot:  From the Active Directory sites and services UI, you can see that a new site US01 is  created and the new subnet is mapped to it.  After creating the subnet, we can update its description or it can be remapped to  other sites using the Set-ADReplicationSubnet cmdlet:  Set-ADReplicationSubnet -Identity "172.16.10.0 24" -Description "Subnet  for new building" -Site INDIA  [ 96 ]   The preceding command adds a new description to the subnet object and changes  the mapping to the INDIA site.  This screenshot shows the status of the subnet object after modifications.  Removing sites and subnets Removing sites and subnets is very straightforward. Remove-ADReplicationSite  and Remove-ADReplicationSubnet can be used for this purpose:  Remove-ADReplicationSite -Identity US01  You will receive a warning message similar to the one shown in the following  screenshot while attempting to delete a site. It is important to pay attention to such  messages and understand the impact before proceeding with the change. In this case,  also deleting the Active Directory site can cause problems for domain controllers  because the NTDS objects of the domain controllers are children of the site object. It  is recommended to delete a site only when it is empty and doesn't have any domain  controllers inside it.  [ 97 ]   Similarly, AD subnet objects can also be deleted using the following command:  Remove-ADReplicationSite -Identity US01  Like site deletion, the subnet deletion also prompts for confirmation. Choose the  option YES after reading through the message. This confirmation message can be  skipped by adding -Confirm:$false to the previous command.  Summary In this chapter, we explored various operational exercises related to Active Directory  domains, OUs, and sites using PowerShell. These are the stepping stones for further  learning. You can explore each cmdlet by querying its help content. This is the best  way to improve your knowledge of these cmdlets.  The next chapter covers performing some advanced operations in Active Directory  such as installing of new domains and domain controllers, replication management,  the transfer of FSMO roles, and so on using PowerShell. Performing these operations  helps automate complex tasks.  [ 98 ]   Advanced AD Operations  Using PowerShell  As the title suggests, you will learn about performing some of the advanced Active  Directory operations using PowerShell in this chapter. Windows administrators who  manage Active Directory environments can leverage the contents of this chapter to  automate some of these advanced operations and perform troubleshooting. In large  complex environments, these operations are pretty frequent and common, which  calls for automation to save everyone's time.  While PowerShell can be used for performing many high-level operations in Active  Directory, this chapter will focus on the following common and frequently used  topics that are helpful to most administrators:  Installing a new domain        Adding additional domain controllers    Obtaining replication status of Active Directory    Managing fine-grained password policies    Transferring FSMO roles    Restoring deleted objects    Demoting domain controllers and removing domains  Let's see how we can achieve these tasks using PowerShell in the Windows Server  2012 R2 environment. Also, the modules and cmdlets used in this chapter are  available on Windows Server 2012 but the demonstration is completely based   on its R2 version.   Installing a new domain Starting from Windows Sever 2012, Microsoft has changed the way Active Directory  installations work. It stopped supporting dcpromo and now the installation of  Active Directory domain or domain controllers is completely through roles in Server  Manager. If you run the dcpromo.execommand on Windows Server 2012 or later, the  following message will appear:  As you can read from the preceding screenshot, the Active Directory Domain  Services installation has been moved to the Server Manager snap-in. It can be  installed and configured like any role installation that you do from Server Manager.  In this section, we will leverage PowerShell and learn the procedure to perform  installation and configuration of the AD DS role. Configuration is nothing but a  setting whether you want to create a new domain  or forest  or you want to make  the server as domain controller for an existing domain. Configuration also includes  topics such as where you want to place the DIT file, logs, SYSVOL, whether it is a  Read Only Domain Controller  RODC , details of the server from where you want  to perform the initial replication, and so on.  Installation of the AD DS role is very simple and straightforward. The Install- WindowsFeature cmdlet in the ServerManager PowerShell module helps with  installation. Let's first find the status of the role on the server on which we want to  perform the installation. In this demonstration, we are going to install a new domain  called techibee.local on TIBDC4. It is the first domain controller in the domain.  First, import the ServerManager module using the following cmdlet into the current  PowerShell session:  Import-Module ServerManager  Once imported, we can start the installation of AD DS Role using the   Install-WindowsFeature cmdlet in the ServerManager module, as   shown in the following command:  PS C:\>Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services  -IncludeManagementTools fl  [ 100 ]   Success       : True  RestartNeeded : No  ExitCode      : Success  PS C:\>  FeatureResult : {Active Directory Domain Services, Remote Server      Administration Tools, Active Directory module forWindows      PowerShell, AD DS and AD LDS Tools...}  When the preceding command is executed, you will see the PowerShell progress bar  at the top of the PowerShell window. As you can see in the output, the command  installed a few additional features along with the AD DS Role. These are the essential  components for configuring AD DS from PowerShell and are also required for  configuring AD DS using UI components.  The preceding installation provides a new Active Directory module called  ADDSDeployment, that contains cmdlets for performing several deployment tasks  related to Active Directory.  The following command shows the available commands in the ADDSDeployment  module:  Get-Command -Module ADDSDeployment  The following screenshot shows output of the preceding command:  This section completely relies on the preceding cmdlets to configure Active   Directory environment.  [ 101 ]   As we want to install a new forest  techibee.local , we need to choose Install- ADForest from the preceding list of cmdlets. Before we proceed with the installation,  we need to identify a few details that are essential for new domain installation. One  has to do this irrespective of whether PowerShell or GUI is used for installation. The  details of the new domain installation are as follows:     Domain FQDN and NetBIOS name: Decide the FQDN, which is short for  Fully Qualified Domain Name  For example, techibee.local , you want to  keep for the domain and the NetBIOS name. The domain name is mandatory  and the NetBIOS name is optional. When a NetBIOS name is not specified, it  is computed from the domain name. In this demonstration, we are setting the  domain name to techibee.local and NetBIOS name to TIBROOT.     Domain mode and forest mode: Decide on the domain mode and forest   mode that you want to set for the new domain. Available domain and   forest modes are Win2003, Win2008, Win2008R2, Win2012, and Win2012R2.  If you don't specify a mode, it is computed and configured automatically.   In this demonstration, we are setting the domain and forest levels to the  highest  Win2012R2 .     Database path, Logs path, and SYSVOL path: By default, these logs are   placed in the system root folder  for example, C:\Windows . However, some  organizations prefer to have them in different locations than the default.  In such cases, create the folders well in advance before you pass them  to the cmdlet. Executing the command will not create the folders. In this  demonstration, we will keep them in a folder called C:\ADDS.     Safe mode Admin Password: This is also called as Directory Service   Recovery Mode  DSRM  password. This is the password that you need  to enter when you boot your domain controller in AD DS Recovery mode.  Decide on a password and it should be passed as a secure string to the  Install-ADForest cmdlet.  Once you have these details ready, you can proceed with installing a new domain in  the forest using the Install-ADForest cmdlet.  There are two commands that install the new domain:     The following command prompts for the DSRM password. Enter the   password that you have chosen: $dsrmpwd = Read-Host "Enter DSRM Password" -AsSecureString  [ 102 ]      The following command installs the Active Directory domain called   techibee.local: Install-ADDSForest -DomainNametechibee.local -     DomainNetbiosName TIBROOT -DomainMode Win2012R2 -ForestMode      Win2012R2 -SafeModeAdministratorPassword $dsrmpwd -     InstallDns -DatabasePath C:\ADDS\DS_DB_Logs -LogPath      C:\ADDS\DS_DB_Logs -SysvolPath C:\ADDS\SYSVOL -     NoRebootOnCompletion  Here is the output, showing a few warning messages; they are mostly related to the  domain and forest mode that was chosen, and about creation of DNS delegation, as  shown in the following screenshot:  You should carefully read these warnings and understand if any action is required or  if they affect you in anyway. The Status column in the end result shows the installation status. A Success value  indicates that the first domain in the new forest is successfully deployed. The  Message column shows that the server should be rebooted to make the changes  come into effect.  [ 103 ]   After the reboot, you can get details of forest and domain using the commands you  learned in Chapter 5, Managing Domains, OrganizationalUnits, Sites and Subnets, which  are as follows:  Get-ADForest  Get-ADDomain  After the completion of these commands, review any warning or error messages  for necessary actions. The Status column in the output indicates the installation  status. If everything looks good, then proceed with installation of the server so that  the configuration can come into effect. Reboot can be automated by omitting the  -NoRebootOnCompletion parameter but this will not give us a chance to review   the output of the command.  This completes installation of the first domain in the forest. If you would like   to add additional domain controllers to this domain, you can do so using the  Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlet. The next section in this chapter helps   with the required procedure for adding additional domain controllers to a domain  using PowerShell.  If you want to install a new domain in an existing forest, then you can make use of  the Install-ADDSDomain cmdlet. The parameters for this cmdlet are pretty much  common when compared to the Install-ADDSForest cmdlet with slight changes.  At the time of installation, you need to specify the parent domain name using the  -ParentDomainName parameter and a few parameters related to DNS delegation.  You can get complete details about this cmdlet from http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library hh974722.aspx.  Adding additional domain controllers In the previous section, we have seen how to deploy a new domain. Active   Directory domains without any redundancy are prone to lots of problems in  the environment. So, Windows administrators design their Active Directory  environment to be redundant by deploying multiple domain controllers. The  necessity to add multiple domain controllers increases on a frequent basis when  the load increases or a new office is opened. This section helps you to understand  what is required to add additional domain controllers to existing Active Directory  environment using PowerShell.  [ 104 ]   As we have seen earlier, the Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlet is available in  the ADDSDeployment PowerShell module and we can leverage it to build additional  DCs. The prerequisite for installing a new DC is installing an AD DS role. You can  follow the installation of AD DS roles, which we covered in the previous section.  Once you have the AD DS components installed, we can promote it as DC in an  existing domain using the Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlet, as shown   in the following command:  PS C:\> Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName techibee.local -     SiteName SITE-A -SafeModeAdministratorPassword $DSRMPwd-     DatabasePath C:\ADDS\DS_DB_Logs -LogPath C:\ADDS\DS_DB_Logs -     SysvolPath C:\ADDS\SYSVOL -InstallDns -NoRebootOnCompletion -     ReplicationSourceDC TIBDC4.techibee.local -Credential  Get-     Credential   You should carefully review the warning messages or any errors messages that  you encounter after executing this command. These messages will have an effect  on functions that this domain controller can serve and the output you get after you  execute this command is as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 105 ]   As you might have noticed in the preceding screenshot, the command will add  TIBDC5 servers as a DC in an existing domain with database, log files, and SYSVOL  folders placed at a custom location. It places this new DC in an Active Directory  site, SITE-A, using the -SiteName parameter. Also, it installs DNS as part of the  DC installation using the -InstallDNS parameter. The -ReplicationSourceDC  parameter tells the new DC where it should replicate the data from. If you are doing  a media-based installation in offices where you have poor network connectivity,   then you can use the -InstallationMediaPath parameter to provide the path   of a backup file.  Another thing to note here is the -Credential parameter, which is used in the  preceding command. Since the DC we are installing is currently in a workgroup,   the command needs a credential to connect to existing DCs in the domain to  perform a new domain installation. The credentials we provide to the -Credential  parameter are used for this purpose. The preceding command will prompt you  for the credentials and you will need to enter a domain account, that is capable  of adding new DCs to an existing domain. You can also store the credentials in a  variable and pass it to this parameter. The Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlet  has several other options that help you in customizing the installations.  You can get a full list of supported arguments either by looking at the  help content of this cmdlet or from http:  technet.microsoft. com en-us library hh974723.aspx.  There are a few cmdlets in the ADDSDeployment module that help you to verify if  your environment is ready for installing a new forest, domain, or additional DC by  examining the parameters provided to them. The Install-ADDSForest, Install- ADDSDomain, and Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlets are capable of checking  for these prerequisites and display an error if any of them are not met. Though their  names sound like they can verify the installation status of a new forest, domain,  or DC, their purpose is to just verify the prerequisites for installation. Don't get  confused here with the names. However, if you want to check these requisites before  you start installing the DC, you can use the following command:  Get-Command -Module ADDSDeployment -Name Test*  [ 106 ]   The cmdlets in the following screenshot take the same list of arguments as their  Install-*cmdlet counterparts and verify if all the provided parameters are correct  and valid:  For example, the Test-ADDSDomainControllerInstallation cmdlet takes the same  set of arguments as the Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlet and verifies if all the  provided parameters are valid. It tests whether the C:\ADDS\DS_DB_Logs folder exists  and whether the site name you chose exists; it also checks the ability to communicate  with DCs in the domain using the credentials you provided and executes various  checks. It gives a meaningful error message when any of these checks fails.  Note: If you have already verified the prerequisites with the  Test-ADDSDomainControllerInstallation cmdlet and  don't want the checks to be run at the time of DC installation,  you can skip it by passing the -SkipPreChecks parameter  with the Install-ADDSDomainController cmdlet.  Obtaining an Active Directory   replication status In Active Directory, replication is crucial. Any replication failures can cause  inconsistency and might provide different results to different set of users. Because  of this reason, organizations have tight controls around monitoring Active Directory  replication failures and consistency. Windows administrators rely on the most  famous utility, repadmin.exe, to query the replication data. It provides very detailed  information about the replication status between domain controllers and metadata  details of DCs, objects, and so on. However, developing automations around the  repadmin.exe utility is not so easy because the output is in text format and you  need to parse it to get the required portion of data. Given these reasons, Microsoft  has introduced a few cmdlets in the Active Directory module starting from Windows  Server 2012 to deal with Active Directory replication. This list is not exhaustive  enough to perform all sorts of replication activities but serves common needs.  [ 107 ]   To get all cmdlets that work with replication in Active Directory, you can use the  following command:  Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory -Name *repl*  As you can see in the following screenshot, there are a few cmdlets that work with  Active Directory sites, subnets, and links:  We have already discussed the usage of sites and subnet-related cmdlets in   Chapter 5, Managing Domains, Organizational Units, Sites, and Subnets. So in this  section, we will concentrate on cmdlets listed in the following table that are   actually related to replication of Active Directory data:   Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata  Get-ADReplicationFailure  Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata  Get-ADReplicationQueueOperation  Gets the replication metadata for one or more  specified attributes of a given object Gets details of data mentioning Active  Directory replication failure Gets the replication metadata details for a set of  one or more replication partners specified Returns replication queue details for a specified  server, that is, the Active Directory domain  controller. If the queue is 0  zero  no output is  returned in the console  [ 108 ]   Let's look at each of these cmdlets and their use cases as shown in the   following command:  Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata:  This cmdlet is useful in retrieving the replication metadata details of a given object  at attribute level. For demonstration purposes, description of a user account called  DaveW is updated on the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG domain controller. Now, let's see how  the metadata values look for the description attribute change.  When the command queries the metadata information from the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  domain controller, it appears as shown in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata -Filter * -Object  Get-     ADUser -Identity DaveW  -Server localhost  sort      LastOriginatingChangeTime  select -Last 1  AttributeName                                    : description  AttributeValue                                   : Finance User  FirstOriginatingCreateTime                       :  IsLinkValue                                      : False  LastOriginatingChangeDirectoryServerIdentity     : CN=NTDS      Settings,CN=WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG,CN=Servers,CN=DEFAULT,CN=Sites,     CN=Configuration,DC=techibee,DC=ad  LastOriginatingChangeDirectoryServerInvocationId : 85e00f3b-e233-     48aa-9c1d-7485a3f014ab  LastOriginatingChangeTime                        : 3 11 2014      1:47:09 AM  LastOriginatingChangeUsn                         : 157462  LastOriginatingDeleteTime                        :  LocalChangeUsn                                   : 157462  Object                                           :      CN=DaveW,OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad  Server                                           : WIN-     GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  Version                                          : 3  PS C:\>  [ 109 ]   When queried from the other domain controller, TIBDC2, the attribute metadata  information appears as shown in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADReplicationAttributeMetadata -Filter * -Object  Get-     ADUser -Identity DaveW  -Server TIBDC2  sort      LastOriginatingChangeTime  select -Last 1  AttributeName                                    : description  AttributeValue                                   : Finance User  FirstOriginatingCreateTime                       :  IsLinkValue                                      : False  LastOriginatingChangeDirectoryServerIdentity     : CN=NTDS      Settings,CN=WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG,CN=Servers,CN=DEFAULT,CN=Sites,     CN=Configuration,DC=techibee,DC=ad  LastOriginatingChangeDirectoryServerInvocationId : 85e00f3b-e233-     48aa-9c1d-7485a3f014ab  LastOriginatingChangeTime                        : 3 11 2014      1:47:09 AM  LastOriginatingChangeUsn                         : 157462  LastOriginatingDeleteTime                        :  LocalChangeUsn                                   : 58159  Object                                           :      CN=DaveW,OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad  Server                                           :      TIBDC2.techibee.ad  Version                                          : 3  PS C:\>  As you can see in both cases, we are querying the attribute metadata information  of the DaveW user account, sorting by the LastOriginatingChangeTime value and  showing the last result. In both cases, you can see that the description value is set to  Finance User and the change is originated at WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG. The information  provided by this cmdlet is useful for troubleshooting or investigating attribute  changes of any Active Directory object.  The following cmdlet shows the replication status of one or multiple domain  controllers. It also indicates how many times the replication failed and the   starting time of the failures:  Get-ADReplicationFailure:  [ 110 ]   The following command shows that WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG has replication issues since  the last two attempts with its partner TIBDC2:  PS C:\>Get-ADReplicationFailure -Target WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  FailureCount     : 2  FailureType      : Link  FirstFailureTime : 2 11 2014 5:14:40 PM  LastError        : 1256  Partner          : CN=NTDS Settings,CN=TIBDC2,CN=Servers,     CN=INDIA,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=techibee,DC=ad  PartnerGuid      : 9bd89086-4636-4f04-bc20-8728c76a860f  Server           : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  PS C:\>  This DC was offline for some time and hence we are seeing these failures. If we make  the DC online and force the replication, you should see the FailureCount reverting  to 0. The -Target parameter of this cmdlet by default assumes that you provided the  name of a domain controller. However, you can provide a site name, domain name,  or a forest name to get the replication errors from all domain controllers in that  scope. In such cases, you need to specify the -Scope parameter and also specify   what kind of object you passed to the -Target parameter  for example, site, domain,  and forest .  Following are sample commands, that help in querying the replication failures in  site, domain, and forest:     This command queries all the domain controllers in the techibee.ad forest   for replication failures: Get-ADReplicationFailure  -Target techibee.ad -scope Forest     This command queries all the domain controllers in the techibee.ad   domain for replication failures: Get-ADReplicationFailure  -Target techibee.ad -scope Domain     This command queries all the domain controllers in the INDIA site for   replication failures: Get-ADReplicationFailure  -Target INDIA -scope Site  [ 111 ]   You can have a daily script based on this cmdlet to query replication failures in your  Active Directory environment. Having such a check helps in detecting replication  problems well before someone reports them.  The following cmdlet returns the metadata information of the replication partner of a  given domain controller:  Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata:  The information includes the last replication attempt time, status, partner invocation  ID, GUID, details of the partition it is replicating, type transport link  IP SMTP ,  compression status of replication, and so on.  The following command will give you the partner's metadata information from all  domain controllers in domain:  Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata -Target *  If you are looking for this information from a specific domain controller, then you  can specify the name of the DC, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADReplicationPartnerMetadata -Target TIBDC2  CompressChanges                : True  ConsecutiveReplicationFailures : 0  DisableScheduledSync           : False  IgnoreChangeNotifications      : False  IntersiteTransport             :  IntersiteTransportGuid         :  IntersiteTransportType         : IP  LastChangeUsn                  : 157462  LastReplicationAttempt         : 3 11 2014 2:01:15 AM  LastReplicationResult          : 0  LastReplicationSuccess         : 3 11 2014 2:01:15 AM  Partition                      : DC=techibee,DC=ad  PartitionGuid                  : 93cecb73-8da2-468e-96bf-     dfd208e3aa2a  Partner                        : CN=NTDS Settings,CN=WIN-     GU0PBL7NKSG,CN=Servers,CN=DEFAULT,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC     =techibee,DC=ad  PartnerAddress                 : 85e00f3b-e233-48aa-9c1d-     7485a3f014ab._msdcs.techibee.ad  [ 112 ]   PartnerGuid                    : 85e00f3b-e233-48aa-9c1d-     7485a3f014ab  PartnerInvocationId            : 85e00f3b-e233-48aa-9c1d-     7485a3f014ab  PartnerType                    : Inbound  ScheduledSync                  : True  Server                         : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  SyncOnStartup                  : True  TwoWaySync                     : False  UsnFilter                      : 157462  Writable                       : True  PS C:\>  You can see that this cmdlet returns the details that are mentioned earlier.   This information is helpful in troubleshooting replication issues between   domain controllers.  The following cmdlet returns the replication tasks that are currently queued   on a domain controller:  Get-ADReplicationQueueOperation:  For example, if you imitate replication from DC1 to DC2, you can run this cmdlet  against DC2 to verify if the replication task is added to the queue or not. The items  will be removed from the replication queue of the domain controller once the  items processed. One thing to note here is that it doesn't say whether the item in  the replication queue completed successfully or failed. It just displays the list of  replication tasks pending in a domain controller.  The following command is a sample output from the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG domain  controller, which has replication items from TIBDC2 in the queue:   PS C:\>Get-ADReplicationQueueOperation -Server WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  EnqueueTime    : 5 11 2014 7:55:33 PM  OperationID    : 1050  OperationType  : Sync  Options        : 4099  Partition      : DC=techibee,DC=ad  Partner        : CN=NTDS Settings,CN=TIBDC2,CN=Servers,     CN=INDIA,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=techibee,DC=ad  PartnerAddress : 9bd89086-4636-4f04-bc20-     8728c76a860f._msdcs.techibee.ad  [ 113 ]   Priority       : 90  Server         : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  PS C:\>  This command can be executed against all domain controllers in the domain to know  if there is a large number of items stuck in the queue, causing issues. The output of  this cmdlet is the same as what you see when you run the repadmin command:  Repadmin.exe  queue  The preceding command displays the queued replication requests on   the domain controller from where you run this. The advantage of the   Get-ADReplicationQueueOperation cmdlet when compared to the preceding  command is that it can run remotely against a domain controller and it can be   used to check the queue status easily in the middle of a script.  Managing Fine-Grained Password  Policies Fine-Grained Password Policies  FGPP  was introduced with Windows Server 2008  Active Directory to facilitate multiple password policies in domains. Until this was  introduced, whichever password policy was set in the default domain controller was  to be applied for all domain user accounts, without any exceptions or customization  options. If any category of people in a domain wished to tighten or relax password  policies, then they needed to be moved to a separate domain because of the  limitation with password policies. The introduction of fine-grained policies helped in  such situations. This new feature allows creation of separate password policies for a  list of users or groups without moving them to different domain.  You can read more about fine-grained password policies at  http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library  cc770394%28v=ws.10%29.aspx.  In this section, let's find out how to query, create, and modify these FGPP. FGPPs  are stored in a system container in the domain structure inside a container called  Policy Settings Container  PSC . The PSC contains Password Settings Objects   PSO ,which are nothing but another type of object in Active Directory, similar  to user objects or computer objects. These PSOs will have attributes that indicate  various settings for password policies. One of the attribute is PSO link, which is a  multivalued attribute that links to user objects or group objects to which the policy  will be applied.  [ 114 ]   FGPPs can be managed in two ways. One way is using the Get-ADObject and   Set-ADObject cmdlets in Active Directory and the second way is using the cmdlets  that are explicitly designed to work with FGPPs. In both the cases, we are relying  on Active Directory module for management. Let's explore cmdlets that are already  available for managing fine-grained policies.  The following command shows the list of cmdlets that help in managing FGPPs:  Get-Command -Module ActiveDirectory -Name *FineGrainedPassword*  The cmdlet list returned by the preceding command is more than sufficient to  perform any kind of operations on FGPPs, as shown in the following screenshot:  First, let's find out what are the available FGPPs are in the current domain using  following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy -Filter *  AppliesTo                   : {CN=SpecialAccounts,CN=Users,     DC=techibee,DC=local}  ComplexityEnabled           : True  DistinguishedName           : CN=SpecialAccountsPWDPolicy,     CN=Password Settings Container,CN=System,DC=techibee,DC=local  LockoutDuration             : 00:30:00  LockoutObservationWindow    : 00:30:00  LockoutThreshold            : 0  MaxPasswordAge              : 00:00:00  MinPasswordAge              : 1.00:00:00  MinPasswordLength           : 5  Name                        : SpecialAccountsPWDPolicy  ObjectClass                 : msDS-PasswordSettings  [ 115 ]   ObjectGUID                  : 9138f24e-b17f-4d80-bda5-dce449333af1  PasswordHistoryCount        : 5  Precedence                  : 1  ReversibleEncryptionEnabled : False  PS C:\>  Using the Get-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy cmdlet we queried the domain   for a list of FGPPs and the output shows that there is one such policy that exists  with the name SpecialAccountsPWDPolicy. The output also shows details about  password settings such as lockout threshold, lockout duration, min and max  password age, password history count, and precedence of this policy. The output  also shows the list of Active Directory objects to which this policy will be applied.  We can find more details about the object to which it applies using its DN, as shown  in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADObject -Identity      "CN=SpecialAccounts,CN=Users,DC=techibee,DC=local"   fl  DistinguishedName : CN=SpecialAccounts,CN=Users,     DC=techibee,DC=local  Name              : SpecialAccounts  ObjectClass       : group  ObjectGUID        : d457ea6f-c06f-4d11-911c-b6116ac3bf7b  PS C:\>  Modifications to FGPPs can be done using Set-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy.  It has parameters to set most of the password settings that we have seen while  querying for FGPPs. In the following example, we are trying to change the minimum  password length requirement from five to ten:  PS C:\>Set-ADFineGrainedPasswordPolicy -Identity $pwdpolicy -     MinPasswordLength 10 -PassThru  AppliesTo                   : {CN=SpecialAccounts,CN=Users,     DC=techibee,DC=local}  ComplexityEnabled           : True  DistinguishedName           : CN=SpecialAccountsPWDPolicy,     CN=Password Settings Container,CN=System,DC=techibee,DC=local  LockoutDuration             : 00:30:00  [ 116 ]   LockoutObservationWindow    : 00:30:00  LockoutThreshold            : 0  MaxPasswordAge              : 00:00:00  MinPasswordAge              : 1.00:00:00  MinPasswordLength           : 10  Name                        : SpecialAccountsPWDPolicy  ObjectClass                 : msDS-PasswordSettings  ObjectGUID                  : 9138f24e-b17f-4d80-bda5-dce449333af1  PasswordHistoryCount        : 5  Precedence                  : 1  ReversibleEncryptionEnabled : False  PS C:\>  Transferring FSMO roles In the previous chapter, we have seen how to query FSMO role owners using  PowerShell. Instead of relying on the onnetdom command or any other method,  we leveraged Active Directory PowerShell module and wrote a small PowerShell  function, Get-FSMORoles, to get this information. In this section, let's concentrate   on how to transfer these FSMO roles across domain controllers.  Moving FSMO roles might not be a frequent operation in smaller organizations.  However, if you have multiple domains and forests with a large set of domain  controllers, generally you see the need to do it on a frequent basis for various  reasons. For example, if you have a site where you have a PDC emulator running  and there is a power maintenance issue that demands the shutdown of domain  controllers, then it makes sense to move the PDC emulator to another DC in a  different site.  Active Directory module has a cmdlet called Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationM asterRole, which is used for transferring FSMO roles. We need to pass the name of  the FSMO role and the name of the domain controller to which you want to transfer  the role.  Here is a simple example that transfers the RIDMaster role to TIBDC2 as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\>Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity TIBDC2 -     OperationMasterRoleRIDMaster  Move Operation Master Role  [ 117 ]   Do you want to move role 'RIDMaster' to server      'TIBDC2.techibee.ad' ?  [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?]      Help  default is "Y" : Y  PS C:\>  As you can see in the preceding output, this cmdlet prompts for confirmation before  performing the operations. You can suppress it using the -Confirm parameter with  the move command. This command will not display the status of transfer after  completion. It will throw errors if there is some issue with the transfer operation. So,  you can view the status of role transfer using the Get-FSMORoles function, as shown  in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-FSMORoles -DomainName techibee.ad  PDCEmulator          : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  RIDMaster            : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  InfrastructureMaster : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  SchemaMaster         : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  DomainNamingMaster   : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  PS C:\>  This cmdlet can be used for transferring multiple roles at the same time.   For example, if you want to transfer all five roles to TIBDC2, you can use   following command:  Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity TIBDC2 -     OperationMasterRole RIDMaster,PDCEmulator,     InfrastructureMaster,SchemaMaster,DomainNamingMaster -     Confirm:$false  The preceding command can be further simplified by replacing the role names with  numeric numbers, as shown in the following command:  Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity TIBDC2 -     OperationMasterRole 0,1,2,3,4  -Confirm:$false  In the preceding command, the numbers 0 to 4 indicate each FSMO role:     0: This is the PDCEmulator    1: This is the RIDMaster    2: This is the InfrastructureMaster    3: This is theSchemaMaster    4: This is the DomainNamingMaster  [ 118 ]   This cmdlet also has a parameter called -Server for which you can specify the name  of the AD DS instance to connect to from where you want to initiate the transfer  operation. You can also provide the name of the domain  for example, sales. techibee.ad  if the domain from which you are running is different from where   you want to perform the transfer.  Can this cmdlet perform the transfer of roles only? Can't it do seizing of the role?  Yes, it can do that as well when the -Force switch parameter is used. Being a  Windows administrator managing Active Directory environments, you know when  to perform the transfer and when to opt for seizing. The seize operation is performed  when the domain controller holding the FSMO role is permanently offline or down  for a longer period due to a hardware failure or crash. Thus, you have to act to seize  the role forcefully to the other domain controller.  The following code will demonstrate the PDCEmulator seize operation from the  TIBDC2 to the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG domain controller:  First, let's find out the current placement of FSMO Role owners as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\>Get-FSMORoles -DomainName techibee.ad  PDCEmulator          : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  RIDMaster            : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  InfrastructureMaster : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  SchemaMaster         : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  DomainNamingMaster   : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  As you can see from the preceding command, all FSMO roles are currently on  TIBDC2. Now, let's check if TIBDC2 is reachable or not using the following command:  PS C:\>Test-Connection -ComputerName TIBDC2 -Quiet  PS C:\>  False  PS C:\>  The False value in the output indicates that TIBDC2 is offline. You can also use   ping to examine this, but doing it the PowerShell way helps in incorporating the  code into scripts.  [ 119 ]   Now it's time to attempt the seize operation. The following command transfers the  role from the TIBDC2 to the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG domain controller:  Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG -     OperationMasterRolePDCEmulator -Force -Confirm:$false  Notice the -Force switch that is used in the preceding command.  The usage of the -Force switch first attempts to transfer the role in a graceful  manner. If this fails, then it attempts to seize the role. Since TIBDC2 is offline,   the preceding command seizes the role and places it on the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  domain controller.   After successful completion of the preceding command, we can verify the status of  the seize operation by running the Get-FSMORoles function again, as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\>Get-FSMORoles -DomainName techibee.ad  PDCEmulator          : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  RIDMaster            : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  InfrastructureMaster : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  SchemaMaster         : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  DomainNamingMaster   : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  PS C:\>  As you can see in the output, PDCEmulator role is now transferred to the WIN- GU0PBL7NKSG domain controller.  You can find full details about the Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole  cmdlet at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library ee617229.aspx or by  running the following command:  Get-Help Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Full  This completes your learning about managing FSMO roles using PowerShell. In  the next sections, let's look at how to search and restore deleted objects in Active  Directory using PowerShell.  [ 120 ]   Restoring deleted objects Recovery is important for any IT Infrastructure. Windows administrators perform  deletion of users, groups, and computers to clean up stale objects or as part of a  user account deprovision process. However, these operations can sometimes cause  accidental deletions of live Active Directory objects and in turn affect the business.  Recovery is very important in such cases. The faster you can recover these objects,  the less impact it can have on the business.  Deleted object recovery till Windows Server 2008 was not a straightforward  process and requires time and effort. It includes booting the Active Directory  domain controller into Directory Services Restore Mode  DSRM  and performing  authoritative or non-authoritative restoration of objects.  This situation improved greatly with the introduction of the Optional Recycle Bin  feature in Active Directory with Windows Server 2008 R2. With this feature, the  recovery process is easy and less time-consuming. One of the prerequisite to enable  this feature in Active Directory is that the forest functional level should be at least  Windows Server 2008 R2. You can read more about this feature and other details at  http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library dd379484%28v=ws.10%29.aspx.  The Enable-ADOptionalFeature cmdlet in ActiveDirectory module can be used to  enable the Recycle Bin feature in Active Directory. You can follow the instructions at  http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library dd379481%28v=ws.10%29.aspx  to enable this feature.  Once you have enabled the Recycle Bin feature and it is working, you can use  PowerShell to search for deleted objects easily and recover them. There are two  cmdlets that help in searching and restoring Active Directory objects. They are   as follows:     Get-ADObject: This helps in searching Active Directory for any object type.   It has a switch parameter called -IncludeDeletedObjects, that can be  used for displaying deleted objects as well if any found during the search  operation. Since deleted objects in Active Directory are stored inside a  deleted objects container, we need to set the SearchBase parameter to   its DN.     Restore-ADObject: This cmdlet is used for restoring any deleted object.    It takes deleted objects as inputs and can restore to an old location or   a new location.  [ 121 ]   In this section, we will use these two cmdlets to perform search and restore  operations on deleted objects. First, let's look at how to find deleted objects   using the following command:  Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -     Filter * -IncludeDeletedObjects  Group-Object -Property      ObjectClass  This command searches for deleted objects inside the CN=Deleted Objects,  DC=techibee, and DC=ad containers and lists the objects grouped by their class  name. This is shown in the following screenshot:  As you can see in the preceding output, there are 11 user accounts, two containers,  four computers, and five Organizational Units found in deleted objects container.  Also there are other objects related to DFS and DFS-R but we will focus on working  with users, computes, containers, and OUs.  If you don't want to see all object classes and are just interested in user accounts that  are in the Recycle Bin, you can use the following command:  Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -     Filter { ObjectClass -eq "User" } -IncludeDeletedObjects  The filter can be further improved if you want to search for a particular user, for  example LabUser100 shown in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted      Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -Filter { ObjectClass -eq "User" -and      msDS-LastKnownRDN -eq "Labuser100"} -IncludeDeletedObjects  -     Properties *  select Name, DistinguishedName, Description,      Deleted, ObjectClass, LastKnownParent  [ 122 ]   Name              : Labuser100                      DEL:e57d89bf-f585-4fa3-b845-139b56ebc6ad  DistinguishedName : CN=Labuser100\0ADEL:e57d89bf-f585-4fa3-b845-     139b56ebc6ad,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad  Description       : Finance User  Deleted           : True  ObjectClass       : user  LastKnownParent   : OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad  PS C:\>  In the preceding command, the filter is updated to search for deleted user objects  that have the msDS-LastKnownRDN attribute value set to username. This attribute  stores the last known display name of the object. In the preceding output, you can  notice the values of other properties such as DN, LastKnownParent, description,  and so on. The value of the LastKnownParent attributes indicates the location in  Active Directory from where this object is deleted.  Similarly, in this way you can search for deleted computer objects or group objects  by adjusting the values of the -Filter parameter. Following are the sample  commands that you can use for searching other object types:     Search for deleted computer objects:  Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted      Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -Filter { ObjectClass -eq      "Computer"} -IncludeDeletedObjects     Search for deleted group objects:  Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted      Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -Filter { ObjectClass -eq      "Group"} -IncludeDeletedObjects     Search for deleted containers or Organizational Units:  Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted      Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -Filter { ObjectClass -eq      "Container" -or ObjectClass -eq "organizationalUnit"} -     IncludeDeletedObjects  Once we have the object information of the deleted item, we can proceed with  restoration using the Restore-ADObject cmdlet. For demonstration, let's restore   the LabUser100 user account using the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted      Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -Filter { ObjectClass -eq "User" -and      msDS-LastKnownRDN -eq "Labuser100"} -IncludeDeletedObjects       Restore-ADObject -PassThru  ft -AutoSize  [ 123 ]   The restoration is very simple as shown in the following screenshot:  We just need to pass the object of the deleted account to the Restore-ADobject  cmdlet. The output shows the DN of the user that indicates the path it restored.   As mentioned before, it restores to the path that is stored in the LastKnownDN  attribute of the deleted object. We can verify the status of restoration by querying   for the LabUser100 account using the Get-ADUser cmdlet as shown in the   following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADUser -Identity LabUser100  DistinguishedName : CN=Labuser100,OU=LAB,DC=techibee,DC=ad Enabled           : False GivenName         : Name              : Labuser100 ObjectClass       : user ObjectGUID        : e57d89bf-f585-4fa3-b845-139b56ebc6ad SamAccountName    : Labuser100 SID               : S-1-5-21-822638036-2026389545-1116158610-1351 Surname           : UserPrincipalName :  PS C:\>  The Get-ADUser cmdlet output shows that the object is restored to LAB OU. One  thing to note here is that the status of the object will not change after the restoration,  which means that all properties of the object stay intact and the password also  remains the same.  Also restoration of a deleted object can be performed to a new path using the  -TargetPath parameter of the Restore-ADObject cmdlet. Let's modify the previous  restore operation to restore the user object to an OU called PROD, as shown in the  following command:  Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted Objects,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  -     Filter { ObjectClass -eq "User" -and msDS-LastKnownRDN -eq     "Labuser100"} -IncludeDeletedObjects  Restore-ADObject -TargetPath      "OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD"  [ 124 ]   The preceding command restores the LABUser100 user account to the  OU=PROD,DC=techibee,DC=AD OU. Note that LABUser100 is deleted again for  demonstration purposes. You cannot actually restore an account multiple times.  After the restoration to a different path, verify the status of the object by running  Get-ADUser cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\>Get-ADUser -Identity LabUser100  DistinguishedName : CN=Labuser100,OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad  Enabled           : True  GivenName         :  Name              : Labuser100  ObjectClass       : user  Surname           :  UserPrincipalName :  PS C:\>  ObjectGUID        : e57d89bf-f585-4fa3-b845-139b56ebc6ad  SamAccountName    : Labuser100  SID               : S-1-5-21-822638036-2026389545-1116158610-1351  Now you can see that the object is restored to PROD OU. Restoration of any other  deleted computer, group, container, and OU object can be performed in a similar  way using the Restore-ADObject cmdlet.  Demoting domain controllers and  removing domains At the beginning of this chapter, you saw how to create a new domain  or forest   using PowerShell and also learned how to add new domain controllers to existing  domain. Just as we automated this domain or domain controller provision process  with the help of cmdlets in the ADDSDeploy PowerShell module, we can perform  demotion of domain controllers and domains using the cmdlets available in   this module.  The cmdlet used for this purpose is Uninstall-ADDSDomainController. Using this,  we can demote a domain controller alone or the domain  or forest  itself. There is  another cmdlet called Test-ADDSDomainControllerUninstallation, that helps in  verifying prerequisites for uninstalling a domain controller.  [ 125 ]   When you demote a Windows Server 2012 domain controller manually, you will be  prompted with several options that are essential for demotion functionality and later.  Following are some of the important parameters that you should understand and  have handy to input at the time of domain controller demotion:     LocalAdministratorPassword: This parameter specifies the password    to be set for the local administrator account after the demotion of the   domain controller.     LastDomainControllerInDomain: This parameter is used for specifying  that the domain controller you are demoting is the last domain controller  in the domain. If the domain controller being demoted is the last domain  controller in a child domain, then you need to use additional parameters  such as Removednsdelegation, Removeapplicationpartitions,  Ignorelastdnsserverforzone, and so on.  All these parameters  except LocalAdministratorPassword  take $true or $false  as a value. So based on the state of the domain controller you demote, decide on   the parameters to be used and pass them to the Test-ADDSDomainControllerUnins tallation cmdlet to ensure that you meet all prerequisites for demoting the   domain controller.  The following section demonstrates how to demote additional domain controllers  from a domain and demoting the last domain controller in a domain.  First, let's look at how to demote an additional domain controller from a domain. It  assumes that you have other domain controllers in this domain running in a healthy  condition and reachable.  Since it is an additional domain controller, using the LocalAdministratorPassword  parameter should be sufficient.  First, read the password into a variable as a secure string so that we can pass it   to the Test-ADDSDomainControllerUninstallation cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:  $localadminpassword= Read-Host "Enter password for local admin" -     AsSecureString  Now, we can test whether the domain controller meets all the prerequisites for  demoting. This can be done with the following command:  Test-ADDSDomainControllerUninstallation -LocalAdministratorPassword      $localadminpassword  [ 126 ]   If the output shows success, then you are all set to start the demotion process as  shown in the following screenshot:  If the Status shows any error, then review the value of the Message property to  understand the reason for failures.  To demote the domain controller, use the following command. As you can  see it has the same parameters that we passed to the Test cmdlet. Only  -NoRebootOnCompletion is used to capture the output after the demotion process:  Uninstall-ADDSDomainController -LocalAdministratorPassword      $localadminpassword -NoRebootOnCompletion  When the preceding command is executed, you will be prompted for confirmation,  as shown in the following screenshot:  You can suppress it using the -Confirm parameter if you don't want it to prompt.  After saying Yes to the confirmation prompt, the demotion process starts and the  status message after the completion indicates the results. A success message indicates  that demotion is completed successfully. In case of error, review the value of the  Message property to find more details about the reason for failures.  This completes the demotion of an additional domain controller in the domain.   Now, let's look at demoting the last domain controller in the domain.  [ 127 ]   First, we need to test if we have all the prerequisites ready for removing the last  domain controller from the domain. Since this domain is a forest root, specifying the  LastDomainControllerInDomain and RemoveApplicationPartitions parameters is  sufficient. If this is a child domain, then the DNS delegation references from the parent  domain DNS should be removed and you need to use the RemoveDNSDelegation  and other parameters based on your domain setup. The following command verifies  readiness for demoting the last domain controller from the domain:  Test-ADDSDomainControllerUninstallation -LocalAdministratorPassword      $localadminpassword -LastDomainControllerInDomain -     RemoveApplicationPartitions  The output in the following screenshot indicates the cmdlet executed successfully:  Since we are good with prerequisites, let's proceed with the actual process for  demoting the domain controller by passing the same arguments to the Uninstall- ADDSDomainController cmdlet. The following command will start the uninstallation  process and reboots the server after successful completion:  Uninstall-ADDSDomainController -LocalAdministratorPassword      $localadminpassword -LastDomainControllerInDomain -     RemoveApplicationPartitions -Confirm:$false  After the successful completion of this command, you can remove the AD DS role  from the server using the Remove-WindowsFeature cmdlet in the ServerManager  PowerShell module.  This completes the demonstration of demoting domain controllers and domains  using PowerShell in Windows Server 2012 environment. You can find details about  manual demotion process of a domain controller at http:  technet.microsoft. com en-us library jj574104.aspx.  [ 128 ]   Summary In this chapter, we have seen some of the advanced operations in Active Directory  and how to perform them using Active Directory and the AD DS Deployment  PowerShell modules. The code samples provided in this section help you in kick  starting your learning process and improving your skills further. Since these are  advanced operations, it is recommended that you understand each parameter   that is being used thoroughly and test them in a lab setup before attempting in a  production environment.  In the next chapter, we will see how to manage DFS-N  Distributed File System  Namespace  and DFS-R  Distributed File System Replication  using PowerShell. To  manage these components we need to rely on other modules such as DFS-N and  DFS-R in addition to the Active Directory module.  [ 129 ]    Managing DFS-N and DFS-R  Using PowerShell  DFS-N stands for Distributed File System Namespace and DFS-R stands for  Distributed File System Replication. These are two familiar technologies for  any Windows administrator. DFS-N provides a simplified view of all file system  resources across multiple servers and sites, and DFS-R simplifies it further by  replicating content between servers. These two combined together form DFS  technology in Windows.   You can read more about this at http:  technet.microsoft. com en-us library jj127250.aspx.  Both these technologies can be managed to a great extent using PowerShell with the  help of the DFS-N and DFS-R modules. The DFS-N module was introduced with  Windows Server 2012 and the DFS-R module was introduced with Windows Server  2012 R2. So, you need to have Windows Server 2012 R2 installed to get both the  modules. These modules are available and are a part of the DFS Management tools  that come with the DFS-N or DFS-R roles installation. If your DFS infrastructure  has at least one server with Windows Sever 2012 R2 installed, you can leverage  these modules to manage the entire DFS infrastructure. If you don't have a  Windows Server 2012 R2 in your DFS infrastructure, you need to write code to  query DFS Windows Management Instrument  WMI  classes on the Windows  Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 operating systems to manage DFS-N and  DSFS-R. Managing DFS through WMI queries is not discussed here and you might  want to refer to the MSDN link http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library  bb540028%28v=vs.85%29.aspx to understand these WMI classes.   In this chapter, you will be learning about performing the following operations   with PowerShell:  Installing DFS roles        Managing DFS-N    Managing DFS-R  Before proceeding further with exploring the usage of these modules, it is important  to understand some of the basics of DFS-N so that you will understand the  remaining content of this book easily without confusion.  In the following screenshot, you can see two namespaces and we are going to work  with one of the namespace called \\techibee.ad\Personal:  This namespace has a folder inside it with the name Projects, that has two folders  with links such as ADBook, and ADPresentations and one folder without any link  called Music. The Music folder has two more folders linked to it, named as Classic  and New Releases. Here is a brief explanation of DFS-N components that we see in the preceding  screenshot:     Namespace root: This is the starting point of the namespace. Since it starts   with the name of the domain, it is a domain-based namespace where  configuration is stored in Active Directory. The Windows sever that   hosts this namespace share is called as namespace server.  [ 132 ]      Namespace folder: Folders without targets or links are called namespace   folders. The purpose of these folders is to form a hierarchy in the namespace.  These can have other namespace folders or folders with targets and links   as children     Namespace folders with targets: These are the namespace folders that have  targets configured. This means that, when you access these folders, they will  get redirected to the file shares configured behind them as targets. These  targets can be Windows shares, Network Attached Storage  NAS  shares,   or Samba shares.  Installing DFS roles The installation process of DFS-N or DFS-R components is very straightforward.  These roles can be installed on Windows Server 2008 or later using ServerManager  PowerShell module, the default with Windows Server installations. The   Install-WindowsFeature cmdlet in this module helps to install these roles.   These roles can be installed using a GUI as well, but the procedure is not   covered here because we want to leverage PowerShell.  Before proceeding with the installation, let's first verify the status of the role.  Executing the Get-WindowsFeature cmdlet tells us about the role installation   status. This cmdlet is also available as part of the ServerManager module.  In the following command, the FS-DFS-Namespace and FS-DFS-Replication  services are the names of the DFS-N and DFS-R roles:  PS C:\> Get-WindowsFeature -Name FS-DFS-Replication,FS-DFS-Namespace      select DisplayName, Name, Installed  ft -AutoSize  DisplayName     Name               Installed  -----------     ----               ---------  DFS Namespaces  FS-DFS-Namespace       False  DFS Replication FS-DFS-Replication      False  PS C:\>  The Installed column specifies whether a role is currently installed or not. If none of  these roles are installed, both the roles have a False value in the Installed column.  [ 133 ]   Installing the DFS-N role DFS-N can be installed using the Install-WindowsFeature command by passing  a FS-DFS-N name to it. Since we are installing DFS components for the first time  on this box, let's choose to install DFS Management tools as well by adding the  -IncludeManagementTools parameter. In the following command, we have used  the -ComputerName parameter to install the DFS Management tools on the TIBDC3  computer. You can omit this parameter to install the tools on local computer:  PS C:\>Install-WindowsFeature -Name FS-DFS-Namespace -     IncludeManagementTools -ComputerName TIBDC3  Success Restart Needed Exit Code      Feature Result  ------- -------------- ---------      --------------  True    No             Success        {DFS NamespacesDFS Management  Tools, Fi...   PS C:\>  The preceding output shows that the DFS-N feature  along with the Management  tools  is successfully installed and no rebooting is required after installation. You  can automate the reboot by adding the -Restart switch to the preceding command.  Once this has been done, verify the installation of the DFS-N and DFS Management  tools by running the following command:  Get-WindowsFeature -Name FS-DFS-Namespace, RSAT-DFS-Mgmt-Con -     ComputerName TIBDC3  The output of the preceding command is shown in the following screenshot:  Note: The ServerManager module in Windows Server 2008  with  and without R2  didn't support the installation of roles remotely;  we did this in the preceding command using the -ComputerName  parameter. The cmdlets should be executed locally on these  server versions for installation of roles. Also, the Install- WindowsFeature cmdlet is not available in Windows Server 2008  and you need to use the Add-WindowsFeature cmdlet instead.  [ 134 ]   After the installation, you can verify functionality by opening the DFS   Management console.  Installing the DFS-R role Installation of the DFS-R role is similar to the installation of the DFS-N role. Its just  that you need to change role name to DFS-R. Use the following command to do so:  Install-WindowsFeature -Name FS-DFS-Replication -     IncludeManagementTools -ComputerName TIBDC3  After running the preceding command successfully, verify the installation status by  running the Get-WindowsFeature cmdlet:  Get-WindowsFeature -Name FS-DFS-Replication, RSAT-DFS-Mgmt-Con  You will get an output similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:  As indicated in the preceding output, the DFS-R role is successfully installed along  with Management tools.   Managing DFS-N In this section, you will learn about managing DFS-N using PowerShell. The DFS-N  module that we just installed in the previous section comes with a large number of  cmdlets for managing DFS-N. Throughout this section, we will make use of some of  these cmdlets to perform the management of DFS-N.  You can view all the cmdlets in the DFS-N module using the following command:  Get-Command -Module DFSN  There are 23 cmdlets in this module that can help in performing various DFS-N  operations. We will be using these modules to query, create, modify, and delete  namespaces, DFS folders, and targets in following sections. You can refer to the  TechNet page at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library jj884270. aspx to know more about these cmdlets.  [ 135 ]   Querying DFS namespaces In this section, you will be learning how to query lists of namespaces in the domain  environment and their configuration details. Lists of DFS-N roots in a domain  environment can be queried using the Get-DFSNRoot cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:   Get-DFSNRoot  This queries and displays all DFS-N roots in the current domain. If you would like to  query DFS-N roots from a different domain, then you can use the -Domain parameter  as shown in the following command:  Get-DfsnRoot -Domain sales.techibee.ad  This queries all the DFS-N roots in the sales.techibee.ad domain. These queries fetch the data from Computer Integrated Manufacturing  CIM   classes in the background. If you want to see what CIM classes are queried,   pipe the output to Format-List cmdlet as shown in the following command:  Get-DfsnRoot -Domain techibee.ad  Format-List *  The CIM * properties in the output show details about the CIM classes. You can read  more about CIM classes at the MSDN page at http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us  library aa386179%28v=vs.85%29.aspx.  The output of the preceding command is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 136 ]   All DFS namespace roots are hosted on a Windows Server. This is called the  namespace  target. You can view the server on which a DFS-N root is hosted with the  help of the following command:  Get-DfsnRootTarget -Path \\techibee.ad\Personal  Format-List  As you can see in the following screenshot, the TargetPath property shows the  share name where the DFS-N root details are stored. It also gives additional details  such as their status  online offline  and priority details:  If your organization has lots of DFS-N root namespaces and you would like to get  only the namespaces that match a particular string, you can use the Where-Object  parameter to filter it, as shown in the following command:  Get-DfsnRoot -Domain techibee.ad  Where-Object {$_.Path -match      "personal" }  The following screenshot shows a DFS namespace with names containing the word  personal, displayed as a result of the filtering we did:  So far, we have discussed querying DFS namespaces that are hosted in domain  mode. If you ever attempt to create DFS-N root namespace from the DFS  Management GUI, you will notice that DFS-N root namespace can be created as a  standalone namespace. In such cases, the namespace root is accessed using the name  of the server where the namespace is hosted.  [ 137 ]   The Get-DFSNRoot cmdlet can be used to query such standalone DFS namespaces as  well. To query the details, you need to pass the name of the DFS server to this cmdlet  using the -ComputerName parameter, as shown in the following command:  Get-DfsnRoot -ComputerName TIBDC2  The output should look like the following screenshot:  As you can notice in this output screenshot, the Type column indicates what type of  DFS-N root namespace it is.  Refer to the MSDN link http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library  jj152371%28v=vs.85%29.aspx. There are three types of DFS-N root namespaces  that can be created. They are as follows:     Standalone    Domain V1  Windows Server 2000 mode      Domain V2  Windows Server 2008 mode   The feature set of each of these unique, and Domain V2 mode is the best.  This completes querying the DFS namespace details using PowerShell. Now, let's  move on to querying DFS-N folders and the targets configured behind them.  Querying DFS-N folders and targets So far, you have learned how to query the details of DFS-N roots. In this section,  we will look at querying folders and targets inside the root namespace. This can be  achieved using the Get-DfsnFolder cmdlet as shown in the following command:  Get-DfsnFolder -Path \\techibee.ad\Personal\*  [ 138 ]   This lists all the DFS-N folders that have targets. In the following screenshot, the  Format-Table cmdlet with the -Autosize parameter is used to show values of  all properties clearly. Otherwise, you will see property values ending with dots.  The output here shows the list of DFS folders and their State  Offline or Online ,  together with a few additional configuration details of DFS folders:  Note: If there is a folder in the DFS-N structure that has no  target set and no child items exists, then you might see a  description such as "temporary link used by the DFS UI".  Please do not delete that folder.  Each of these folders will have at least one target set and we can access the targets   of these folders using the Get-DFSNFolderTarget cmdlet, as shown in the   following command:  Get-DfsnFolderTarget -Path      \\techibee\Personal\Projects\ADPresentations  This command lists all the targets behind this DFS-N folder. These targets are the  actual file shares where the data is placed. The following output screenshot shows  the DFS-N folders and the targets behind them:  This output helps you to understand other configuration parameters, for example  knowing which one has the highest priority, and so on. As you can see in the  preceding screenshot, the first target has the ReferralPriorityClass column set   to the global-high value.  [ 139 ]   This information is the same as what you see when you go to the DFS tab of the   \\techibee.ad\Personal\Projects\ADPresentations folder from Windows   Explorer, as shown in the following screenshot:  Note that, if you see a discrepancy between what you see in the  PowerShell output and what you see in File Explorer in terms of target  lists, then it can be a caching-related issue on the computer where you  are using the Explorer. In such cases, run the dfsutil  pktflush  command from the command line to clear the local DFS cache and let  Explorer get fresh details from the DFS namespace servers. The output  you see from PowerShell is more accurate because it fetches the data  from DFS namespace servers directly.  You can query all folders and their targets in a given DFS-N root using the following  command. It exports the data into Excel for easy viewing and filtering:  Get-DfsnFolder -Path \\techibee.ad\Personal\*  % {Get-     DfsnFolderTarget -Path $_.Path } Export-csv c:\temp\DFS-N-     PerSonal.csv -NoTypeInformation  [ 140 ]   The contents of output CSV appear similar to what is shown in the following  screenshot:  You can explore this topic further by viewing the help content of the Get-DFSNFolder  and Get-DFSNFolderTarget cmdlets.  Creating the DFS-N root and folders So far, we have seen how to query the existing DFS-N data. This section covers  how to create DFS-N root namespaces and folders. The New-DFSNRoot and New- DFSNFolder cmdlets are used for this purpose.  To create a new DFS-N root, similar to the \\techibee.ad\personal folder, we  first need to create a share on the DFS namespace server where we want to host  this configuration. Say for example, we want to create a new root for the Sales  department so that they can access their data through this namespace. We also  identified the TIBDC2 server, which will host this namespace. Then we need to create  a share on the TIBDC2 server with any name of our choice. This share name is used  with the -TargetPath parameter of the New-DFSNRoot cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:  New-DfsnRoot -Path \\techibee.ad\Sales -TargetPath \\TIBDC2\Sales -     Type DomainV2  As you can see in the preceding command, we have defined the new DFS-N root  path as the \\techibee.ad\sales folder and the target path is set to the share that we  created on the TIBDC2 server. This DFS-N root is of DomainV2 type.  Note: It is important to create the target share beforehand.  Otherwise, the cmdlet will give reporting errors related to  accessing the share. Also, ensure that the domain administrator  has full control on this share.  [ 141 ]   After the preceding command has executed successfully, the new DFS-N root  namespace will appear in the DFS Management console as shown in the following  screenshot. As you can see in the screenshot, the \\techibee.ad\sales DFS  namespace is listed in the DFS Management console:  Now that we have a new root setup, let's add some folders to it. The New- DFSNFolder cmdlet helps in doing this, as shown in the following command:  New-DfsnFolder -Path \\techibee.ad\Sales\Reports      \\TIBDC2\SalesReports  -Description "All the reports of sales     department are here"  The preceding sample command is used to create a DFS folder with the target.  Depending on the type of DFS-N root, you can set different parameters for the  DFS folder during its creation. Some of them are EnableInsiteReferrals,  EnableTargetFailback, ReferralPriorityClass, ReferralPriorityRank,   state, and so on.  You can view the full help content of the New-DFSNFolder cmdlet to know more  about these parameters and their significance by using the following command:  Get-Help New-DfsnFolder -Full  The next section helps to understand how to add targets to existing DFS-N folders.  Adding and removing folder targets In the previous section, you learned about creating new DFS-N roots and folders.  This section will help you to understand how to add targets to existing DFS-N  folders and remove them if necessary.  The cmdlets used for achieving this task are New-DfsnFolderTarget and   Remove-DfsnFolderTarget. If you would like to add a new target to the folder we  created in the last section, we can do it using the New-DfsnFolderTarget cmdlet.  Before proceeding with the command, we need to ensure that the new target is  created and accessible.  [ 142 ]   The following command adds a new target \\tibdc2\salesreports-backup to the  \\techibee.ad\sales\Reports folder. It also sets the priority level to GlobalHigh  while adding it:  New-DfsnFolderTarget -Path \\techibee.ad\sales\Reports -TargetPath      \\TIBDC2\SalesReports-Backup -ReferralPriorityClass GlobalHigh  After the addition, you can view the current targets for the \\techibee.ad\sales\ reports folder by running the following command:  Get-DfsnFolderTarget -Path \\techibee.ad\sales\Reports  From the following screenshot, we can see that the new target we added is reflected  in the configuration:  You will see the same thing in the DFS tab of the Reports Properties dialog in the  following screenshot:  Removing a target path from a DFS folder is also straightforward and we need to use  the Remove-DFSNFolderTarget cmdlet for this purpose:  Remove-DfsnFolderTarget -Path \\techibee.ad\sales\Reports -TargetPath      \\TIBDC2\SalesReports  This will prompt you to confirm the removal of the given target path from the DFS-N  folder. This can be suppressed using the -Confirm:$false parameter. If you receive  errors during the removal, try using the -Force switch.  [ 143 ]   Similarly, the DFS-N folder itself can be removed from the DFS namespace.  Removing a DFS-N folder will delete the complete configuration of that folder  including the targets. This is shown by the following command:  Remove-DfsnFolder -Path \\techibee.ad\sales\Reports  This removes the \\techibee.ad\sales\Reports folder along with its target entries.  Note: Either deleting the targets or deleting the DFS folder itself will just  delete the references to target paths in the DFS configuration. This will  not touch any data inside the target paths.  This completes the topic of managing DFS-N using PowerShell and the   DFS-N module.  Managing DFS-R DFS-R is a technology to replicate data between two Windows Servers. You   can choose to keep data in the d:\Project folder on SERVER1 in sync with the   e:\Project folder on SERVER2. To do this, you need to have the DFS-R role  installed on both the servers. The installation section at the beginning of this chapter  will help you with detailed steps to install the DFS-R service and DFS Management  tools. The replication can be a two-way replication or one-way replication based on  requirements. This is what DFS-R is in a nutshell.  You can visit http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library  cc771058.aspx to know more about DFS-R in detail.  As mentioned earlier, Microsoft released a PowerShell module called DFS-R with  Windows Server 2012 R2 release. This section completely relies on this module for  performing DFS-R related operations. These cmdlets will not work on previous  versions of operating system.  The DFS-R module has a total of 42 cmdlets to perform DFS-R related operations.  This section focuses on some of the most commonly used cmdlets as they are  required during the demonstration. A complete list of cmdlets in this module is  available at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us library dn296591.aspx.  You can also get this list by running the Get-Command -Module DFSR cmdlet.  [ 144 ]   Before proceeding with querying using PowerShell, let's brush up a little bit on the  building blocks of DFS-R. As you can see from the DFS Management console, DFS-R  has groups that keep the configuration related to replication of a set of folders.   A DFS-R Group consists of the following information:     Member Servers: These are the servers where DFS-R components are   installed and have folders to be replicated.     Connections: These are the objects that define the replication topology  between the member servers. If there is a connection from SERVER1 to  SERVER2, it means that data is replicating from SERVER1 to SERVER2. Data  from SERVER2 to SERVER1 will not get replicated unless there is another  connection for it.     Replicated Folders: These define which folders are replicated between the  member servers. They contains the path at source and path at destination.   So, for any DFS-R replication to work successfully, we should have these three  components configured correctly. All our examples in following DFS-R section  revolve around these components only.  Querying DFS-R groups and settings Let's start exploring the usage of the DFS-R module by starting with querying  existing DFS-R groups and configuration. Beginning from Windows Server 2008 R2,  the SYSVOL replication started relying on DFS-R for efficient replication. So, if you  have SYSVOL replication happening through DFS-R in your environment, you will  see the Domain System Volume DFS-R Group in the DFS Management GUI, as  shown in the following screenshot:  [ 145 ]   As you can see in the preceding screenshot, there are two DFS-R groups at   the moment and one of them is the Domain System Volume, which is for   SYSVOL replication. We can query the list of DFS-R groups by running the   Get-DFSReplicationGroup cmdlet, as shown in the following screenshot:  As you can see in the output, the -IncludeSysVol switch is used with the Get- DfsReplicationGroup cmdlet. Without this switch the cmdlet will show only the  Scripts DFS-R group. The output will also contain information about the group, such  as Identifier, DomainName, Description, and State. The State parameter indicates  the current state of the replication group. If the State is set to InComplete, it means  that there is some issue with the replication group configuration.  You can query a single DFS-R group details using the -GroupName parameter, as  shown in the following command:  Get-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName Scripts  Find the members of a replication group using the Get-DfsrMember cmdlet, as  shown in the following command:  Get-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName Scripts  Get-DfsrMember  Running the preceding command will show the ComputerName, Site Name, and  Connection details of each DFS-R member that is configured inside the group. This  information is the same as what you see in the Membership tab of the respective  group in the DFS Management console.  [ 146 ]   The members in a DFS-R group communicate with each other based on what  is configured in the Connections tab in the DFS Management console. This  information includes Source Server, destination server, Enable status, and other  details. These details can be queried using the Get-DfsrConnection cmdlet, as  shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Get-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName Scripts  Get-     DfsrConnection  Identifier              : e5106ebe-0457-437f-9e7f-2e8e3a9ea40c  GroupName               : Scripts  SourceComputerName      : TIBDC2  DestinationComputerName : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  DomainName              : techibee.ad  Enabled                 : True  RdcEnabled              : True  CrossFileRdcEnabled     : True  Description             :  MinimumRDCFileSizeInKB  : 64  State                   : Normal  GroupName               : Scripts  SourceComputerName      : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  DestinationComputerName : TIBDC2  DomainName              : techibee.ad  Enabled                 : True  RdcEnabled              : True  CrossFileRdcEnabled     : True  Description             :  MinimumRDCFileSizeInKB  : 64  State                   : Normal  PS C:\>  [ 147 ]  Identifier              : 6ca2a9f2-c232-4f10-959f-4c2471640472   This command gives a list of connections, the source, and the destination server of  each connection, its Enable status, and other information. This information is the  same as what you see in the Connections tab of the Replication group in the DFS  Management GUI. This can be seen in the following screenshot:  So far, we have seen how to query memberships and connections configured in a  replication group. Now, let's verify the actual folders being replicated. Surprisingly,  there is no cmdlet in the DFS-R module that can actually query the paths of folders  being replicated in the source and destinations. However, we can build our own  function using the underlying WMI classes.  Here is one such simple function, that identifies the members of a given replication  group and connects to them using WMI to fetch the actual folders being replicated:  function Get-ReplicatedFolderPaths { [cmdletbinding  ] param      [string]$FolderName    Import-Module Dfsr  $members = Get-DfsReplicatedFolder -FolderName $FolderName  Get- DfsrMember foreach $member in $members  {     $Rgs = Get-WmiObject -Namespace Root\MicrosoftDFS -Class  DfsrReplicatedFolderConfig -ComputerName $member.ComputerName     $Rgs  ? {$_.ReplicatedFolderName -eq $FolderName }  select  PSComputerName, ReplicatedFolderName, RootPath } }  [ 148 ]   Following is the command, that queries the replication partners of the replication  group with the name PowerShell and gets the actual folder names being replicated:  PS C:\> Get-ReplicatedFolderPaths -FolderName PowerShell  ft -     AutoSize  PSComputerName  ReplicatedFolderName RootPath  --------------  -------------------- --------  WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG PowerShell           C:\scripts\PowerShell  TIBDC2          PowerShell           C:\Scripts\PowerShell  PS C:\>  The output that you see can be found in the Memberships tab in the DFS  Management GUI, as shown in the following screenshot:  If you want to query any other details that are not available through the DFS-R  module, you can leverage DFS-R WMI classes to fetch the information. The following  command will help to aquire the list of WMI classes related to DFS-R:  Get-WmiObject -Namespace Root\MicrosoftDFS -List  ? {$_.Name -match      "dfs" }  The namespace Root\MicrosoftDFS is for V1 version of DFS-R WMI  classes. Starting  with Windows Server 2012 R2, Microsoft introduced  the V2 version of WMI classes, which can be accessed from the Root\ Microsoft\Windows\DFSR namespace. The V1 namespace is also  available in Server 2012 R2 to support the legacy.  [ 149 ]   Creating a DFS-R group In the previous section, we have seen how to query existing DFS-R groups and their  configuration. Now, let's look at creating a new DFS-R group and configuring it for  replicating folders between two servers.  Creating a DFS-R group and configuring it is a step-by-step process. Before you  start, ensure that you have actually installed DFS-R roles on member servers where  you want to replicate the data. Once roles are installed, we can proceed with DFS-R  group creation and configuration.  First, let's create a new DFS-R group called VBScripts. The New- DfsReplicationGroup cmdlet in the DFS-R module helps in creating   a new group, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> New-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName VBScripts  Identifier  : b00e9ea4-c38a-4079-af7b-9d7494a8852f  GroupName   : VBScripts  DomainName  : techibee.ad  Description :   State       : Normal  PS C:\>  Once the group is created, we need to create a replication folder object and associate  it with the newly created group. The New-DfsReplicatedFolder cmdlet helps in  doing this as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> New-DfsReplicatedFolder -GroupName VBScripts -FolderName      AllVBScripts  Identifier             : 59c80183-996b-4766-b589-a8039f9b274f  GroupName              : VBScripts  FolderName             : AllVBScripts  DomainName             : techibee.ad  Description            :   FileNameToExclude      : {~*, *.bak, *.tmp}  DirectoryNameToExclude : {}  DfsnPath               :   [ 150 ]   IsDfsnPathPublished    : False  State                  : Normal  PS C:\>  Once the replication folder object is created and associated to the group, let's add the  members to the group. Say we have a VBscripts group in the TIBDC2 server at the  C:\Scripts\VBScripts path, and we want to replicate them to the C:\Scripts\ VBScripts-Backup folder on the TIBDC3 server. So, to achieve this we need to add  TIBDC2 and TIBDC3 as members to the VBScripts DFS-R group. It can be done using  the Add-DfsrMember cmdlet by passing the replication group name and member  names, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Add-DfsrMember -GroupName VBScripts -ComputerName      TIBDC2,TIBDC3  GroupName                    : VBScripts  ComputerName                 : TIBDC2  DomainName                   : techibee.ad  Identifier                   : 533ba2d5-4066-48e4-a4ed-7976dd0aa778  Description                  :   DnsName                      : TIBDC2.techibee.ad  Site                         : INDIA  NumberOfConnections          : 0  NumberOfInboundConnections   : 0  NumberOfOutboundConnections  : 0  NumberOfInterSiteConnections : 0  NumberOfIntraSiteConnections : 0  IsClusterNode                : False  State                        : Normal  GroupName                    : VBScripts  ComputerName                 : TIBDC3  DomainName                   : techibee.ad  Identifier                   : c5662173-c3f4-4fb0-ae3a-73b374620521  Description                  :   DnsName                      : TIBDC3.techibee.ad  Site                         : INDIA  NumberOfConnections          : 0  [ 151 ]   NumberOfInboundConnections   : 0  NumberOfOutboundConnections  : 0  NumberOfInterSiteConnections : 0  NumberOfIntraSiteConnections : 0  IsClusterNode                : False  State                        : Normal  PS C:\>  After adding members to the group, it will show the properties of each member  added. As you can see, TIBDC2 and TIBDC3 are added as members to the VBScripts  replication group.  Once added, we need to create connections between them to control the replication.  In this case, I want all my scripts in TIBDC2 to be transferred to the TIBDC3   server. This means I want a one-way replication; it can be done using the   following command:  PS C:\>Add-DfsrConnection -GroupName VBScripts -SourceComputerName TIBDC2  -DestinationComputerName TIBDC3 -CreateOneWay  Identifier              : fad5bec6-fe21-4f66-b4dd-b8fbeaadb111  GroupName               : VBScripts  SourceComputerName      : TIBDC2  DestinationComputerName : TIBDC3  DomainName              : techibee.ad  Enabled                 : True  RdcEnabled              : True  CrossFileRdcEnabled     : True  Description             :   MinimumRDCFileSizeInKB  : 64  State                   : Normal  PS C:\>  [ 152 ]  This created a new connection with the source computer as TIBDC2 and the  destination computer as TIBDC3.   Note: We used the -CreateOneWay switch with the Add- DfsrConnection cmdlet to create the connection. If this is not specified,  bidirectional connections will get created between the members.  After the connections are created, we need to tell the members which folders should  be replicated. It can be configured using the Set-DfsrMembership cmdlet, as shown  in the following command:  PS C:\> Set-DfsrMembership -GroupName VBScripts -FolderName      AllVBScripts -ComputerName TIBDC2 -ContentPath      "C:\Scripts\VBScripts" -PrimaryMember $true -force  GroupName                   : VBScripts  ComputerName                : TIBDC2  FolderName                  : AllVBScripts  GroupDomainName             : techibee.ad  ComputerDomainName          : techibee.ad  Identifier                  : 56935cc3-f589-454b-8028-1b708cca990c  DistinguishedName           : CN=59c80183-996b-4766-b589- a8039f9b274f,CN=07688a05-0c46-4b4d-8fe2-6f41e51e5352,CN=DFSR-L                                ocalSettings,CN=TIBDC2,OU=Domain  Controllers,DC=techibee,DC=ad  ContentPath                 : C:\Scripts\VBScripts  PrimaryMember               : True  StagingPath                 : C:\Scripts\VBScripts\DfsrPrivate\Staging  StagingPathQuotaInMB        : 4096  MinimumFileStagingSize      : Size256KB  ConflictAndDeletedPath      : C:\Scripts\VBScripts\DfsrPrivate\ ConflictAndDeleted  ConflictAndDeletedQuotaInMB : 4096  ReadOnly                    : False  RemoveDeletedFiles          : False  Enabled                     : True  DfsnPath                    :   State                       : Normal  PS C:\>  [ 153 ]   After updating the membership for the DFS-R member, it shows the folders that are  configured for replication and some other details, that can control the replication. In  a similar way, we need to set the membership on the TIBDC3 server as well.  The following command will set the membership details of the VBScript replication  group and the AllVBScripts folder:  Set-DfsrMembership -GroupName VBScripts -FolderName AllVBScripts -     ComputerName TIBDC3 -ContentPath "C:\Scripts\VBScripts-Backup" -     Force   Note: The content path is different from what is configured on TIBDC2. It  can be any path on the server that exists. There is no requirement that the  source and destination should keep files at the same file-system location.  This completes creating and configuring a new DFS-R replication group. Since the  DFS-R settings are stored in Active Directory, it takes some time for the replication  to start based on your Active Directory replication schedule and DFS-R refresh  frequency. If you want to see things start working immediately, force-replicate the  Active Directory to the domain controllers to which these members are connecting  and then run the following command:  Update-DfsrConfigurationFromAD -ComputerName TIBDC2,TIBDC3  This command forces the DFS-R on given computers to read the configuration from  Active Directory. Once it is completed, you will see the replication happening.  With this, we have completed the DFS-R replication from the TIBDC2 server to the  TIBDC3 server. If you change your mind and now want to configure by directional  replication so that changes you make on TIBDC3 contents get replicated to TIBDC2  VBscripts folder, then you can create one more DFS-R connection, as shown in the  following command:  Add-DfsrConnection -GroupName VBScripts -SourceComputerName TIBDC3 -     DestinationComputerName TIBDC2 -CreateOneWay  [ 154 ]   After the completion of Active Directory replication, you will see changes replicating  in both directions. The configuration of the VBScripts replication group appears like  the following screenshot from the DFS Management GUI:  You can explore the help content of these cmdlets further to understand various  options for creating replication groups.  Deleting a DFS-R group Deleting a DFS-R replication group is simple and straightforward. It can be   done using the Remove-DfsReplicationGroup cmdlet. Deleting the replication  group will not cause actual data to be deleted; it just deletes the members,  membership details, connections, and other group-related configuration. Using   the -RemoveReplicatedFolders switch, we are removing all the folder objects  that are associated with this group. Use the switch option wisely, as shown in the  following command:  Remove-DfsReplicationGroup -GroupName VBScripts -     RemoveReplicatedFolders -Force  The preceding command removes the VBScripts DFS-R group along with   its configuration.  Note: The -Force switch is used in the preceding command. It  deletes the DFS-R group without asking for confirmation. Remove  this switch if you want to review the message and then provide  confirmation of deletion.  [ 155 ]   Summary In this chapter, you have learned about managing DFS-N and DFS-R using  PowerShell. The code samples given are the starting points for getting yourself  familiarized with the DFS-N and DFS-R modules. These modules have several  cmdlets, each dedicated to perform a particular action. Go through the complete list  of cmdlets in these modules to increase your skill.  The next chapter is about managing DNS servers, another core component of Active  Directory. They can be managed using the DNSServer module, which comes with  the DNS Management tools. You will see how this module comes in handy to  perform DNS server and client-related operations.  [ 156 ]   Managing Active Directory  DNS Using PowerShell  Domain Naming Service  DNS  is a key component in today's computer world.  It plays a crucial role in corporate environments. Without it, logging in to the  desktops will not work, all applications may fail to connect to the network, there  may be authentication issues everywhere, and even Internet browsing might become  impossible. In this chapter, the focus is limited to DNS in the Active Directory  environment, Windows client environment, and managing DNS in these areas   using PowerShell.  Active Directory relies heavily on DNS to function. Without DNS  Microsoft DNS or  Bind , Active Directory cannot function. It uses DNS for various purposes, such as  name resolution, the DC locator process, and to identify some of the services in the  domain. As a Windows administrator, it is important to understand how to manage  DNS in a Windows environment using PowerShell so that most of the daily tasks can  be automated and troubleshooting can be done in a faster way.  Microsoft has introduced two DNS-related PowerShell modules with Windows  Server 2012. These modules simplify the majority of the DNS administration tasks  and help to configure the environment in a much faster way.  The modules are as follows:  1.  DNS server  DNSServer : As the name indicates, this module will help in  managing DNS server components. Using this module we can create and  manage zones, records, servers, configuration, and so on.  2.  DNS client  DNSClient : As the name indicates, this is used to manage    the DNS Client. This module is handy for identifying and modifying what  DNS servers are configured on network adapters, their DNS suffixes, and  other information.   There are no significant differences between the DNSServer module  in Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2. The only  new cmdlet that got added in Windows Server 2012 R2 is the Step- DnsServerSigningKeyRollover cmdlet. Also, a few new parameters  are added for a couple of cmdlets. The DNS Client module remains the  same in both the versions of Windows. You may want to refer to the  following article to learn more: http:  technet.microsoft.com  en-us library dn305898.aspx.  In this chapter, we will learn about performing the following tasks using PowerShell:     Installing and configuring a DNS server    Working with root hints and forwarders    Managing DNS zones    Creating, modifying, and deleting DNS records    Managing DNS clients  Installing and configuring a DNS server In this section, let's learn some of the basic Windows DNS server-related operations,  installation, and configuration of a DNS server. To start with, how do we know if a  given server is a DNS server and can function properly? DNS servers are generally  configured on the network adapter in the Windows operating system. If you have  multiple network adapters, then it is possible for each adapter to have its own set   of DNS servers.  In Windows Server 2012 or later, we can get the DNS server IP addresses that are  assigned to local adapters by running the following command:  PS C:\> Get-NetIPConfiguration -InterfaceAlias LabNet  InterfaceDescription : Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapter 3  InterfaceAlias       : LabNet  InterfaceIndex       : 19  NetProfile.Name      : techibee.ad  IPv4Address          : 10.10.101.20  IPv4DefaultGateway   :  DNSServer            : 10.10.101.20                         10.10.101.10  [ 158 ]   This returns the IP configuration details of the network interface with the name  LabNet. Once we know the DNS server IP addresses, we can perform a test to  confirm if they are functioning or not. Also this cmdlet works for Windows Server  2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. The Test-DnsServer cmdlet in the DNSServer  module can help in performing this test by using following command:  PS C:\> Test-DnsServer -IPAddress 10.10.101.20  ft -AutoSize  IPAddress    Result  RoundTripTime TcpTried UdpTried  ---------    ------  ------------- -------- --------  10.10.101.20 Success 00:00:00      False    True  PS C:\>  A "Success" message in the output indicates that the IP address passed to the Test- DnsServer cmdlet is a valid DNS server and is listening to answer the queries.  You will receive a No Response message as status if the server is not functional.  This cmdlet is also capable of verifying the forwarder functionality and root hints  functionality of the DNS server. It can also verify if the given DNS server hosts a  zone or not.  As you can see in following screenshot, the 10.10.101.10 DNS server is responding  to the normal DNS and the techibee.ad zone-based queries, but it is failing when  queried for root hints. It is failing because 10.10.101.10 server has no access to the  internet so it cannot send queries to root hints:  Once we have found that the given IP address is a functional DNS server, then  we can get further details by using the Get-DnsServer cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:  Get-DnsServer -ComputerName 10.10.101.10  [ 159 ]   This gives a huge amount of detail about the DNS server. The information categories  returned by this cmdlet are server settings, serverDsSetting, server scavenging  settings, server recursion, server diagnostics, global name zone settings, server cache  settings, forwarders, root hints, zones it is hosting, and their aging details. To put it in  a simple way, this cmdlet returns all the details that you want to know about the DNS  server. Since the output returned by this cmdlet is extensive, this cmdlet provides a  few cmdlets that helps in querying the information about each of the aforementioned  components. To get these cmdlet names, use the following command:  PS C:\> Get-Command -Module DNSServer -Name Get-Dnsserver*  CommandType     Name                                       ModuleName  -----------     ----                                       ----------  Function        Get-DnsServer                              DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerCache                         DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerDiagnostics                   DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerDirectoryPartition            DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerDnsSecZoneSetting             DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerDsSetting                     DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerEDns                          DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerForwarder                     DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerGlobalNameZone                DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerGlobalQueryBlockList          DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerRecursion                     DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerResourceRecord                DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerRootHint                      DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerScavenging                    DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerSetting                       DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerSigningKey                    DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerStatistics                    DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerTrustAnchor                   DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerTrustPoint                    DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerZone                          DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerZoneAging                     DNSServer  Function        Get-DnsServerZoneDelegation                DNSServer  PS C:\>  [ 160 ]   As you notice in the output, the names of the cmdlets are very intuitive, as they  tell you what information they return. Since it is very easy to understand their  functionality by looking at the name, further details about each cmdlet individually  are not given here. You may get the help content of each cmdlet by using the  following command to read more about them. These cmdlets will be used as required  throughout this chapter whenever we have a need to query this information:  Get-Help   -Full  Now that we understand how to query the details of a DNS server, let's proceed with  installing a DNS server using PowerShell.  Installing a DNS server In an Active Directory environment, a DNS server is installed along with domain  controller installation. Each DC is expected to have a local DNS server but it is  not mandatory; it is a best practice. In Chapter 6, Advanced AD Operations Using  PowerShell, we learned how to install a DNS server at the time of installing a new  domain or domain controller. Now let's see how to install a standalone DNS server.  We may or may not use this DNS for hosting Active Directory-integrated zones.  Installation of DNS server components is as good as installing the DNS server  feature. This feature can be installed locally or from a remote machine using   the Add-WindowsFeature cmdlet in the ServerManager module. We can verify   the installation status of the DNS role on a remote computer by using the   following command:  PS C:\> Get-WindowsFeature -Name *dns* -ComputerName TIBSRV4  select      DisplayName, Installed  ft -AutoSize  DisplayName      Installed  -----------      ---------  DNS Server           False  DNS Server Tools     False  PS C:\>  [ 161 ]   As you can see in the output, the DNS server role as well as the Management tools  are not installed at the moment. Let's proceed to install them. Installation of any  role or feature can be performed using the Add-WindowsFeature cmdlet. Use the  following command to install DNS server and Management tools:  PS C:\> Add-WindowsFeature -Name DNS, RSAT-DNS-Server -ComputerName      TIBSRV4 -IncludeAllSubFeature  Success Restart Needed Exit Code      Feature Result  ------- -------------- ---------      --------------  True    No             Success        {DNS Server, Remote Server  Administration   PS C:\>  The output of the command shows that the installation was successful, and no restart  is needed after installation. If the Restart Needed property is Yes, then you need  to restart the server to complete the installation. The restart can also be automated  by using the -Restart switch with the preceding command, which will trigger the  reboot if a restart is needed to complete the installation.  After the installation, the functionality can be verified using the Test-DnsServer  command, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Test-DnsServer -IPAddress 10.10.101.26  ft -AutoSize  IPAddress    Result  RoundTripTime TcpTried UdpTried  ---------    ------  ------------- -------- --------  10.10.101.26 Success 00:00:11      True     True  PS C:\>  The Test-DnsServer cmdlet has the -ComputerName parameter,  which can take the FQDN or NetBIOS name of the server to test for DNS  functionality. But even after specifying the parameter, the cmdlet can  keep on prompting for the IP address since it is a mandatory property.  Because of this the, IP address is passed to the Test-DnsServer cmdlet  wherever it is used in this book.  This completes the installation of DNS server using PowerShell.  [ 162 ]   Configuring the DNS server In this section let's look at some of the common DNS configuration tasks that you  need to perform after a new DNS server installation. The configuration of the DNS  server depends on an individual organizations needs and customizations.  Changing the listening IP address When a new DNS server is installed, it listens on all available IP addresses by  default. In some cases, the system administrators want to restrict the DNS server to  listen on only a particular IP. Let's see how we can achieve this using PowerShell.  If you use DNS Management GUI, you will notice the list of IP addresses the DNS  server is listening. You can get this from DNS server properties in the Management  console, as shown in the following screenshot:  This configuration can be obtained either using the Get-DnsServer cmdlet or Get- DnsServerSetting cmdlet. Let's explore and see how we can get this information by  using following command:  Get-DnsServerSetting -All -ComputerName WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  [ 163 ]   This command returns all settings of the DNS server running on the   WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG server. The list of settings returned by this cmdlet is the same as  what you see under the ServerSettings section of the Get-DnsServer cmdlet. The  Get-DnsServerSetting cmdlet also returns 71 properties that talk about various DNS  server configuration settings. If you are just interested in seeing basic components,  then you can remove the -All switch, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerSetting -ComputerName WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  ComputerName       : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  MajorVersion       : 6  MinorVersion       : 2  BuildNumber        : 9200  IsReadOnlyDC       : False  EnableDnsSec       : True  EnableIPv6         : True  ListeningIPAddress : {fe80::246e:8f45:f80a:a44f, 192.168.0.10,      10.10.101.20}  AllIPAddress       : {fe80::246e:8f45:f80a:a44f, 192.168.0.10,     10.10.101.20}  PS C:\>  As you can see in the preceding output, the DNS server is listening on all available  IP addresses  one IPv6 IP and two IPv4 IPs . If you want to configure the DNS server  to listen on only one IP address  for example: 10.10.101.20 , then you can use the  following commands:  $DNSObj = Get-DnsServerSetting -ComputerName WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG -All  $DNSObj.ListeningIPAddress = @ "10.10.101.20"   Set-DnsServerSetting -InputObject $DNSObj  Using the above commands, first we query the instance of DNS server and store it  in the $DNSObj variable. Then we update the ListeningIPAddress property of the  instance to use the IP that we want to set, and then pass the instance object to the  Set-DnsServerSetting cmdlet with -InputObject parameter so that it can write  the changes to the DNS server.  [ 164 ]   After this change, you can verify the DNS server settings again to verify if  the change is applied or not. In the following output, you can see that the  ListeningIPAddresses property is updated to use the 10.10.101.20 IP address by  using the following command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerSetting -ComputerName WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  ComputerName       : WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG.techibee.ad  MajorVersion       : 6  MinorVersion       : 2  BuildNumber        : 9200  IsReadOnlyDC       : False  EnableDnsSec       : True  EnableIPv6         : True  PS C:\>  ListeningIPAddress : 10.10.101.20  AllIPAddress       : {fe80::246e:8f45:f80a:a44f, 192.168.0.10,      10.10.101.20}  One thing to note here is that, while creating an instance of  the DNS server, the -All switch parameter is used with the  Get-DnsServerSetting cmdlet. This is mandatory because  the Set-DnsServerSetting cmdlet takes the object type  generated with the -All switch. Otherwise, it will fail with  errors indicating an incorrect input object type.  You can follow the same approach for changing any property that you see in the  Get-DnsServerSetting cmdlet output.  Enabling or disabling recursion Recursion is another setting that a lot of organizations customize. By default, the  DNS server performs recursive queries on behalf of the client and sends back the  final reply to it by forwarding the queries to other DNS servers or root hints. It is a  name-resolution technique in which the DNS server, queries other DNS servers on  behalf of client to deliver the fully resolved name.  [ 165 ]   We can use the Set-DnsServerRecursion cmdlet to disable or enable recursion on a  DNS server as shown in the following command:  Set-DnsServerRecursion -ComputerName TIBDC2 -Enable $false  This command disables the recursion feature on the TIBDC2 server. So, from now  onwards, the TIBDC2 server will answer the queries related to the zones for which it  is authorized. For other zones, it will either redirect to a forwarder or root hints.  The current settings of recursion can be viewed by using the Get- DnsServerRecursion cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerRecursion -ComputerName TIBDC2  Enable               : False  AdditionalTimeout s  : 4  RetryInterval s      : 3  Timeout s            : 8  SecureResponse       : True  PS C:\>  As you can see in the output, recursion is disabled on the server.  Working with root hints and forwarders In this section we will focus on how to configure root hints and forwarders for the  DNS server that we have just installed. Before proceeding with that, let's learn a bit  about root hints and forwarders. They are as follows:     Root hints: Each DNS server is authorized to provide responses to zones   hosted on them. But what if the DNS server you are querying is not  responsible for the DNS data you are looking for? In such cases, DNS uses  the root hint servers to find the authoritative name servers for the domain  you are looking for and provides you the results by contacting them. The  DNS server should be able to talk to these root hint servers. The default root  hint servers are placed on the Internet since your DNS server should have  access to these root hints for resolution.  [ 166 ]      Forwarders: Using root hints for non-authoritative name resolution   operations is not always possible. DNS servers in corporate environment  may not be allowed to talk to root hint servers on the Internet. In such  cases, you can design one or two DNS servers in the corporate environment  to communicate with root hints for non-authoritative queries, and the  remaining DNS servers can forward the non-authoritative queries to   these designed DNS servers. This is done by configuring forwarders   in DNS configuration.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  IANA  maintains a list of root hint  servers for Internet name resolutions and the list is available at https:  www.iana. org domains root files. You can visit this website if you want more information  about root hints. You can also visit http:  www.root-servers.org  to know the  locations of different root hint servers across the globe.  We can query the root hints configured in a Windows DNS server using the   Get-DnsServerRootHint cmdlet. Using this cmdlet, we can query the root hints  of any local or any other Microsoft DNS server in the network, as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerRootHint -ComputerName TIBDC2  NameServer                                        IPAddress  ----------                                        ---------  b.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:84::b  f.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:2f::f  c.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:2::c  e.root-servers.net.                               192.203.230.10  h.root-servers.net.                               128.63.2.53  g.root-servers.net.                               192.112.36.4  a.root-servers.net.                               2001:503:ba3e::2:30  d.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:2d::d  PS C:\>  [ 167 ]   If you want to add a new root to the list, you can use the Add-DnsServerRoothint  cmdlet. In the following example, we are adding a new root hint m.root-servers. net server to the list and then verifying whether it is added or not by using the Get- DnsServerRootHint cmdlet, as shown in the following commands:  PS C:\> Add-DnsServerRootHint -ComputerName TIBDC2 -NameServer      m.root-servers.net. -IPAddress 202.12.27.33 -PassThru  NameServer                                        IPAddress  ----------                                        ---------  m.root-servers.net.                               202.12.27.33  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerRootHint -ComputerName TIBDC2  NameServer                                        IPAddress  ----------                                        ---------  b.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:84::b  f.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:2f::f  c.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:2::c  e.root-servers.net.                               192.203.230.10  h.root-servers.net.                               128.63.2.53  g.root-servers.net.                               192.112.36.4  a.root-servers.net.                               2001:503:ba3e::2:30  d.root-servers.net.                               2001:500:2d::d  m.root-servers.net.                               202.12.27.33  PS C:\>  You can see in the preceding output that the m.root-servers.net server is added to  the list of root hints. Similarly, you can add any list of root hints.  Let's look at another example where you have a server set with the correct list of root  hints and then want to replicate it to other DNS servers in your network. There are  two ways to achieve that. One way is to, read a list of root hints from the server and  add them one by one to the other server you need. Alternatively, you can use the  Import-DnsServerRootHint cmdlet, which can import the list of root hints in one  go. The following code sample demonstrates the second approach. In this example,  we are reading the root hints list from the TIBSRV4 server and applying it to the  TIBDC2 DNS server.   [ 168 ]   The code, with its description, is as follows:  Import DNS Server module Import-Module DNSServer  Read existing root hints in TIBDC2 $RootHints = Get-DnsServerRootHint -ComputerName TIBDC2  Remove the existing root hits from TIBDC2 foreach $Root in $RootHints  {     Remove-DnsServerRootHint -ComputerName TIBDC2 -InputObject $Root  -Force }  import root hints from TIBSRV4 DNS Server to TIBDC2 Import-DnsServerRootHint -NameServer TIBSRV4 -ComputerName TIBDC2  You can see in the preceding code that, we first remove the existing DNS root hints  from the server where we want to set the new list. This is because the Import- DnsServerRootHint cmdlet appends the list from the source name server to the  target. It will not overwrite the existing ones unless there is a conflict in name. That  is the reason that we first we remove the existing entries and then import from the  source server.  So far we have seen how to manage the root hint servers in DNS server, now  let's look at managing forwarders. The DNSServer PowerShell module has a set  of cmdlets that can help in adding and removing forwarders  and conditional  forwarders  in Microsoft DNS environment. To see the list of cmdlets that help   in doing these operations, use the following command:  PS C:\> Get-Command -Module DNSServer -Name *Forwarder*  CommandType     Name                                       ModuleName  -----------     ----                                       ----------  Function        Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone      DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerForwarder                     DnsServer  Function        Get-DnsServerForwarder                     DnsServer  Function        Remove-DnsServerForwarder                  DnsServer  Function        Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone      DnsServer  Function        Set-DnsServerForwarder                     DnsServer  PS C:\>  [ 169 ]   In the preceding output, the names of the cmdlets are meaningful, and you can  easily pick up the cmdlet for a given task. By default, the Microsoft DNS server is  configured to use root hints for answering non-authoritative queries. However, the  system administrator can configure forwarders so that any queries that cannot be  answered by the DNS server will get the forwarded to forwarder of the DNS server  for resolution. Forwarders will take precedence over the root hints, and the root hints  will be used only when no forwarders are available or are not responding.  Let's first query the configured forwarders in a DNS server by using the following  command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerForwarder -ComputerName TIBSRV4  UseRootHint        : True  Timeout s          : 3  EnableReordering   : True  IPAddress          : 10.10.101.20  ReorderedIPAddress : 10.10.101.20  PS C:\>  This command queries the forwarders configured on the TIBSRV4 DNS server. A  new forwarder can be added to the list by the Add-DnsServerForwarder cmdlet. It  takes the IP address that you want to add as forwarder and the ComputerName server  where you want to set this forwarder as shown in the following command:  Add-DnsServerForwarder -IPAddress 10.10.101.10 -ComputerName TIBSRV4  You can run the Get-DnsServerForwarder cmdlet again to verify if the forwarder  is added or not. In the similar way, forwarders can be deleted using the Remove- DnsServerForwarder cmdlet. It takes the same set of parameters that the Add- DnsServerForwarder cmdlet accepts, as shown in the following command:  Remove-DnsServerForwarder -IPAddress 10.10.101.20 -ComputerName      TIBSRV4 -Force  The preceding command removes the 10.10.101.20 IP address from the forwarders  list. Managing forwarders in a DNS environment is made easy and simple with   these cmdlets.  [ 170 ]   Conditional forwarders Now let's see how to configure conditional forwarders in DNS. As the name  indicates, these forwarders are used for routing the DNS query traffic based on  a certain condition  domain name . For example, any queries for the records in  techibee.com can be forwarded to a specific DNS server instead of using regular  forwarders or root hints. This is often used in multi-forest environments to route   the DNS traffic from one forest to another.  One limitation of the Microsoft DNSServer module is that it doesn't have a cmdlet to  query the existing conditional forwarders from a given DNS server. But don't worry.  We can build our own function to get the conditional forwarder details. All these  DNS cmdlets makes use of WMI CIM classes in Root\MicrosoftDNS namespace.   So for the conditional forwarder details, we can directly query these classes.  The following is a small function wrapped on top of the MicrosoftDNS_Zone WMI  class that stores zone information. This function can be used to query conditional  forwarder details from any DNS server:  function Get-DNSConditionalForwarder { [cmdletbinding  ] param      [string]$ComputerName   $Zones = @ Get-WmiObject -Class MicrosoftDNS_Zone -Namespace      Root\MicrosoftDNS -ComputerName $ComputerName  ? {$_.ZoneType -     eq 4 }   foreach $zone in $Zones  {   if $Zones  {     $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSobject     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        DNSServer -Value $ComputerName     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        ZoneName -Value $Zone.Name     $OutputObj  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name        ForwarderIP -Value $Zone.MasterServers     $OutputObj   } else {     Write-Warning "$ComputerName doesn't have any conditional        forwarders"   } } }  [ 171 ]   Using this function is very simple. Just copy and paste the code into a PowerShell  window and call the function, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Get-DNSConditionalForwarder -ComputerName TIBSRV4  ft -AutoSize  DNSServer ZoneName          ForwarderIP  --------- --------          -----------  TIBSRV4   sales.techibee.ad {10.10.101.25}  PS C:\>  The TIBSRV4 DNS server has a conditional forwarder for the sales.techibee.ad  domain to forward all related queries to the 10.10.101.25 IP address.  We can create a new forwarder zone by using the Add-DnsServerConditionalForw arderZone cmdlet, which takes the name of the domain for which you want to create  conditional forwarding and the target DNS server for that domain, as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\> Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone -ComputerName TIBSRV4 -     Name google.com -MasterServers 216.239.32.10 -PassThru  ft -     AutoSize  ZoneName   ZoneType  IsAutoCreated IsDsIntegrated IsReverseLookupZone  IsSigned  --------   --------  ------------- -------------- ------------------- --- -----  google.com Forwarder False         False          False  PS C:\>  Once this is done, you can verify the current conditional forwarders by using  the Get-DNSConditionalForwarder function that we just wrote and imported.  By default, the Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone cmdlet creates a  standalone forwarder zone, which means that the created forwarder configuration  is specific to the DNS server. At the time of creation of the forwarding, you can set  it as an AD integrated zone by using the -ReplicationScope parameter. When the  conditional forwarder zone is created as an AD integrated zone, it will get replicated  to other DNS servers based on the scope  domain or forest .  The Set-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone cmdlet can be used to modify the  existing conditional forwarder zones. See its help content for more details.  [ 172 ]   Managing DNS zones In the previous sections, we have seen some of the DNS configuration items. In this  section, we will find out how to manage zones in a DNS environment. Zones are  the actual entities in a DNS environment that store the DNS records and control  replication. There are different types of zone available in DNS, each serving a   specific purpose.  There are three main types of zone available in DNS. They are as follows: 1.  Primary zone: As the name indicates, this is the primary source of   information for the zone. When a zone is created as primary zone, it can be as  a standalone or AD DS-integrated. The standard zone stores the data in file  format in the %windir%\System32\Dns folder on the DNS server where it is  hosted. In the case of AD DS-integrated zone, information is stored in Active  Directory based on the replication type set for the zone  domain or forest .  2.  Secondary zone: This zone acts as backup for a primary zone. It obtains data  from the DNS server that hosts the primary zone. The secondary zone stores  the data in file format at the %windir%\System32\Dns folder on the DNS  server where it is hosted.  3.  Stub zone: When a zone is created as a stub zone, it is only responsible for  storing authoritative name servers of the zone it is hosting. It gets this data  from DNS servers that actually host the primary zone of the domain.  Though DNSServer module has cmdlets for managing each of these zones, this  section focuses only on primary zones. Managing secondary zones and stub zones is  similar to managing primary zones, with a slight change based on the functionality.  You can read more about these zones at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us  library cc771898.aspx.  The cmdlets that are useful for managing primary zones can be obtained by using  the following command:  PS C:\> Get-Command -Module DNSServer -Name *PrimaryZone*  CommandType     Name                                       ModuleName  -----------     ----                                       ----------  Function        Add-DnsServerPrimaryZone                   DnsServer  Function        ConvertTo-DnsServerPrimaryZone             DnsServer  Function        Restore-DnsServerPrimaryZone               DnsServer  Function        Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone                   DnsServer  PS C:\>  [ 173 ]   As mentioned before, primary zones can be created as either file-based or AD DS- integrated. In the former, the zone data is stored in a file, and in the latter case, the  zone data is stored in Active Directory. The advantage of storing the data in Active  Directory is that zone information is replicated along with Active Directory data  replication, and no explicit DNS replication is required for transferring the zone to  other DNS servers. In the Active Directory-integrated zone, all DNS servers that   load the zone information from Active Directory host that zone. Also, all the DNS  servers hosting the zone can make modifications to it. But, in the file-based primary  zone, a system administrator needs to configure the secondary zone for backup on   a different DNS server and ensure that DNS replication is always working.  First let's start with querying existing zones in a DNS server. The Get-DnsServerZone  cmdlet can be used to query the available zones on a DNS server as shown in the  following command:  Get-DNSServerZone -ComputerName TIBDC2  ft -AutoSize  The IsDsIntegrated column in the following output screenshot specifies whether it is  a file-based zone or AD integrated:  A true value indicates that it is AD-integrated, otherwise it is file-based. You might  have noticed one more property in the output, which says IsReverseLookupzone.  This indicates whether a zone is forward zone  name-to-IP resolution  or reverse  zone  IP-to-name resolution .  Now let's create a new primary forward zone that is standalone by using the  following command:  Add-DnsServerPrimaryZone -ComputerName TIBDC2 -Name      child2.techibee.ad -ZoneFile child2.techibee.ad.dns  [ 174 ]   This creates a primary zone with its data stored in the child2.techibee.ad.dns  file on the TIBDC2 server. We can verify if the file is created or not using the Get- ChildItem PowerShell cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Get-ChildItem '\\tibdc2\c$\windows\system32\dns'      Directory: \\tibdc2\c$\windows\system32\dns  Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name  ----                -------------     ------ ----  d----        22 10 2014   1:59 AM            backup  d----         23 8 2014  12:06 AM            samples  -a---         23 8 2014  12:07 AM       1171 cache.dns  -a---        23 10 2014  12:33 AM        566 child1.techibee.ad.dns  -a---        23 10 2014  12:43 AM        562 child2.techibee.ad  -a---        23 10 2014  12:44 AM        566 child2.techibee.ad.dns  -a---        22 10 2014   1:59 AM          0 dns.log  PS C:\>  Once the zone is created, it is ready for hosting the records. To get complete details  about the zone you use the following command:  Get-DnsServerZone -ComputerName TIBDC2 -Name child2.techibee.ad  fl      *  After managing it for some time, if you decide to convert this to an Active   Directory-integrated zone so that AD replication takes care of replicating it to other  DNS servers in the domain or forest, you can convert this zone to AD DS-integrated  by using the following command:  ConvertTo-DnsServerPrimaryZone -ComputerName TIBDC2 -Name      child2.techibee.ad -ReplicationScope Domain -Force  [ 175 ]   Once it is converted to AD DS-integrated zone, wait for the replication to complete  and then you will start noticing this zone in other AD DNS servers in the same  domain. You can also verify this by connecting to the DC=DomainDNSZones,DC= techibee,DC=AD naming context. In case you have selected -ReplicationScope as  forest in previous command, you need to look under the DC=ForestDNSZones,DC=t echibee,DC=ad naming context. You will find all AD DS-integrated zones under the  Microsoft DNS container as shown in the following screenshot:  We can make changes to any primary zone by using the Set-DnsServerPrimayZone  cmdlet. At the time of creating the child2.techibee.ad zone, we haven't selected  any input for dynamic updates. After converting it to Active Directory-integrated  zone, if you want to enable secure dynamic updates on this zone, it can be done  using the following command:  Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -Name child2.techibee.ad -ComputerName WIN-     GU0PBL7NKSG -DynamicUpdate secure  In the preceding command you might have noticed that the WIN-GU0PBL7NKSG  server is used to make changes to the child2.techibee.ad zone. Since it is an AD- integrated zone, it doesn't matter on which DNS server we make the change, as it  will automatically get replicated to others as per the AD replication schedule. After  running the following command, you can verify the details about dynamic updates: PS C:\> Get-DnsServerzone -Name child2.techibee.ad  select ZoneName,     dynamicupdate,IsDSIntegrated  fl  ZoneName       : child2.techibee.ad dynamicupdate  : Secure IsDSIntegrated : True  PS C:\>  With this we will conclude this section and start working with DNS records in the  next sections.  [ 176 ]   Creating, modifying, and deleting   DNS records DNS is all about records. It maintains a record name to respective data-type  mapping. Following are the frequently used resource record types in DNS:  Record Type Record Name Address record A Alias record CNAME Name Server  NS record Pointer  or  Reverse  record State Of  Authority  SOA  PTR  MX  SRV  Mail Exchange  record Service record  Description Used for mapping a name to IPv4 address. Used for mapping an alias to hostname. Gives details about name servers for a given domain.  Maps IP address to a hostname.  This contains administrative information about a  domain hosted by the zone. Details like who owns it,  email ID, refresh interval, retry interval, etc. related  to the zone. This gives the list of email servers that can accept  emails for a given domain.  This is used for mapping a service to hostname and  port details.  There are some more resource record types in DNS that can be created and modified  as well, and that serve different data needs. However, they are less common and  hence not mentioned in the preceding table. You can refer to http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library cc958958.aspx for the full list of resource   records supported by Microsoft DNS.  This section focuses on managing A, CNAME, PTR, and SRV records to demonstrate   the DNSServer PowerShell module usage. These are the cmdlets that can work   with resource records in DNS when using the following command:  PS C:\> Get-Command -Module DnsServer -Name *ResourceRecord*  CommandType     Name                                       ModuleName  -----------     ----                                       ----------  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecord                DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA               DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordAAAA            DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordCName           DnsServer  [ 177 ]   Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordDnsKey          DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordDS              DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordMX              DnsServer  Function        Add-DnsServerResourceRecordPtr             DnsServer  Function        Get-DnsServerResourceRecord                DnsServer  Function        Import-DnsServerResourceRecordDS           DnsServer  Function        Remove-DnsServerResourceRecord             DnsServer  Function        Set-DnsServerResourceRecord                DnsServer  Function        Set-DnsServerResourceRecordAging           DnsServer  PS C:\>  Managing A records and PTR records When you ping google.com, your DNS Client contacts the DNS server for the  resource record of type A to give the IP address of google.com. From then on,   your system communicates with google.com using that IP address.  We can query all A records in a domain by using the following command:  Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -RRType A -ZoneName techibee.ad  The output will contain the HostName and RecordData columns that contain the  name of the host and its IP address that is registered in DNS.  For example, we can query the IP address of TIBDC2 computer by using the  following command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -RRType A -ZoneName techibee.ad -     Name TIBDC2   ft -AutoSize  HostName RecordType Timestamp TimeToLive RecordData  -------- ---------- --------- ---------- ----------  TIBDC2   A          0         01:00:00   10.10.101.10  PS C:\>  As you can see in the output, the 10.10.101.10 IP address is mapped to the   TIBDC2 server.  [ 178 ]   A new A type resource record can be created in a zone using either the   Add-DnsServerResourceRecord cmdlet or Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA  cmdlet, as shown in the following command:  Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -A -ZoneName techibee.ad -ComputerName      TIBDC2 -Name testpc20 -IPv4Address 10.10.101.30  The Add-DnsServerResourceRecord cmdlet has several options to create resource  records. If you feel this cmdlet is confusing to understand because of its number of  options, then you can switch to the respective resource record creation cmdlet  for  example, Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA to create an A type resource record .  You can verify that the record is created by using the following command:  PS C:\> Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -Name testpc20 -ComputerName      TIBDC2 -RRType A  -ZoneName techibee.ad  fl  DistinguishedName : DC=testpc20,DC=techibee.ad,cn=MicrosoftDNS,     DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=techibee,DC=ad  The Resolve-DNSName cmdlet in the DNS Client module is used for testing the  resolution status of a record. Let's try it and see if it is able to resolve our newly  created DNS A record, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Resolve-DnsName -Name testpc20 -Server TIBDC2  fl  HostName          : testpc20  RecordType        : A  RecordClass       : IN  TimeToLive        : 01:00:00  Timestamp         : 0  RecordData        : 10.10.101.30  PS C:\>  Name       : testpc20.techibee.ad  Type       : A  TTL        : 3600  DataLength : 4  Section    : Answer  IPAddress  : 10.10.101.30  PS C:\>  [ 179 ]   It is able to resolve the testpc20.techibee.ad name successfully without issues.  That means the creation went fine. Now let's see how to update the records that   are already created.  The Set-DnsServerResourceRecord cmdlet is used for modifying any DNS record.  It takes two objects as input. One is an old DNS object that has original data and the  other is a new DNS object that has the modified data. The code, with its description,  is as follows:  create object of existing DNS record $OldDNSObj = Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -Name testpc20 -     ComputerName TIBDC2 -RRType A -ZoneName techibee.ad make a clone of old object and name it as new $newDNSObj = $OldDNSObj.Clone   Update the IP Address in object $newDNSObj.Recorddata.IPv4Address = "10.10.101.40" set the modified information on the A record Set-DnsServerResourceRecord -NewInputObject $newDNSObj -     OldInputObject $OldDNSObj -ComputerName TIBDC2 -ZoneName      techibee.ad -PassThru  As you see in the preceding code, we first query the A type record using the   Get-DnsServerResourceRecord cmdlet and stored in the $OldDNSObj variable and  then made a clone of it, which is stored in the $newDNSObj variable. Then we modify  the IP address stored in the new object. Both these new and old objects are passed to  the Set-DnsServerResourceRecord cmdlet to implement the change.  The results can be verified using the Resolve-DnsName cmdlet, as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\> Resolve-DnsName -Name testpc20 -Server TIBDC2   fl  Name       : testpc20.techibee.ad  Type       : A  TTL        : 3600  DataLength : 4  Section    : Answer  IPAddress  : 10.10.101.40  PS C:\>  The result shows that the new IP address came into effect.  [ 180 ]   Now let's look at the procedure for deleting A type resource record. The   Remove-DnsServerResourceRecord cmdlet does this task for us, as shown   in the following command:  Remove-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName techibee.ad -ComputerName      TIBDC2 -RRType A -Name testpc20 -Force  Deletion is simple and straightforward. You need to specify the name of the record,  type, zone name, and the DNS server name. The record will get deleted and  replicated to other DCs as part of the AD replication schedule.  Managing CNAME records The previous section discussed how to create, modify, and delete A type resource  record. The same applies to the CNAME records as well with slight adjustments  in parameters. So without much explanation, let's look at the code required for  managing CNAME records.  The CNAME record can be created using the following command. It creates a CNAME   DC2  pointing to TIBDC2.techibee.ad A record:  Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName techibee.ad -ComputerName      TIBDC2 -Name DC2 -CName  -HostNameAlias tibdc2.techibee.ad  The Resolve-DnsName cmdlet shows these mapping details, as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\> Resolve-DnsName -Name dc2 -Server TIBDC2  Name                     Type   TTL   Section    NameHost  ----                     ----   ---   -------    --------  dc2.techibee.ad          CNAME  3600  Answer     tibdc2.techibee.ad  Name       : tibdc2.techibee.ad  QueryType  : A  TTL        : 3600  Section    : Answer  IP4Address : 10.10.101.10  PS C:\>  [ 181 ]   To modify the CNAME record, the following code can be used:  create object of existing DNS record $OldDNSObj = Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -Name DC2 -ComputerName  TIBDC2 -RRType Cname -ZoneName techibee.ad make a clone of old object and name it as new $newDNSObj = $OldDNSObj.Clone   Update the IP Address in object $newDNSObj.Recorddata.HostNameAlias = "tibdc3.techibee.ad" set the modified information on the A record Set-DnsServerResourceRecord -NewInputObject $newDNSObj -OldInputObject  $OldDNSObj -ComputerName TIBDC2 -ZoneName techibee.ad -PassThru  Use the Resolve-DnsName cmdlet to verify the change, as shown in the following  command:  PS C:\> Resolve-DnsName -Name dc2 -Server TIBDC2  Name                     Type   TTL   Section    NameHost  ----                     ----   ---   -------    --------  dc2.techibee.ad          CNAME  3600  Answer     tibdc3.techibee.ad  PS C:\>  To delete the CNAME record, we can use the same cmdlet that we used for deleting A  records, as shown in the following command:  Remove-DnsServerResourceRecord  -ZoneName techibee.ad -ComputerName      TIBDC2 -RRType CName -Name DC2 -Force  The other records  MX, NS, PTR, and SOA  can be managed in a similar way using the  same set of cmdlets.  Managing DNS Clients So far we have seen different DNS sever-related operations in this chapter. As  mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, a module is available for managing the  client-side operations related to DNS. It can be loaded using the following command:  Import-Module DnsClient  In the previous section, we used the Resolve-Dnsname cmdlet from this module,  which helps in resolving the DNS names. The following are some of the frequent  DNS operations that are performed from the client's-side and sample codes:  [ 182 ]   Get client-side DNS cache. This is equivalent to the ipconfig  displaydns  command in Windows as shown in the following command: Get-DnsClientCache  The client-side cache can be cleared by using the following command. This is  equivalent to the ipconfig  flushdns command: Clear-DnsClientCache  The following command displays the DNS servers configured on the LabNet  network interface: Get-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias Labnet -AddressFamily Ipv4  DNS server IP addresses on the client-side can be changed using the following  command: Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias Labnet -ServerAddresses      @ "10.10.101.25","10.10.101.10"   The Set-DnsClientServerAddress cmdlet has a switch parameter -Validate that  verifies that the given DNS servers are valid and reachable before assigning them   to a  network interface. This validation is not performed when this parameter is   not mentioned.  The existing list of DNS servers can be removed using the following command: Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias Labnet -     ResetServerAddresses  This completes our quick stunt with DNS Client module. However, it is recommended  to explore this module further, as it can perform other operations, that can help with  your automated jobs.  Summary In this chapter, we have learned how to automate DNS server-related operations and  how to perform some client-side tasks using PowerShell modules. The DNSServer  module has more than 100 cmdlets, and is each designed to perform a specific task.  Though not all of these cmdlets are not covered here, it is advisable to go through  them and understand their functionality. This will help in identifying the areas that  you can automate using this PowerShell module.  The next chapter provides some resources useful for learning how to manage Active  Directory using PowerShell and some PowerShell resources for improving your  coding abilities. It also provides some sample scripts that you may want to use in  your environment  of course after proper testing in the lab .  [ 183 ]    Miscellaneous Scripts   and Resources for   Further Learning  In previous chapters, you learned about using PowerShell and Active Directory  modules to manage different AD objects. You also learned about managing the Active  Directory configuration using PowerShell; I hope they gave you a good foundation to  start your automation tasks. This chapter provides you with some useful and handy  scripts to perform a designated task in Active Directory. There are several tasks that  demand automation in Active Directory and it is difficult to cover all of them. So, this  chapter gives you code samples to perform the following Active Directory operations,  which are frequently used and common in most environments. These scripts come in  handy for Windows administrators in their day-to-day operations.  The following is the list of scripts that we are going to discuss in this chapter. You  will also find some useful resources and links at the end of this chapter for further  learning and to get your questions answered, if any, about the following topics:     Checking whether user, group, computer, and Organizational Unit exists    Getting membership of a user, computer, and group    Resetting the password for multiple user accounts    Bulk creation of user accounts    Getting the password expiry date of user accounts    Finding all disabled user accounts    Getting all domain controllers and their site names in the forest    Moving objects from one OU to another      Finding inactive computers in Active Directory    Creating groups in bulk    Exporting AD group member details to Comma Separated Value    Finding empty groups in Active Directory    Checking whether a user is a member of the given group or not    Comparing AD group memberships  The code for the preceding topic is written in the form of functions rather than  scripts. It is easy to reuse these functions and incorporate them into any of your  existing scripts. These functions assume that you have already imported the Active  Directory module. Most of these functions return the output in an object format so  that they can be passed as input to any other function or cmdlet. You can also export  such object-based outputs to a CSV file easily using the Export-CSV cmdlet.  Checking whether a user, group,  computer, or an OU exists Here is a simple script to check whether a user, computer, group, or OU exists in  Active Directory with a given name. This script is capable of accepting multiple  names and testing to see whether they exist:  Function Test-ADObject { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=0 ]   [string[]]$Name,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=1 ]   [ValidateSet "User","Group","Computer","organizationalUnit" ]   [string]$Type   foreach $ObjName in $Name  {   $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{         Name = $ObjName;         IsFound = $null;         ObjectClass = $Type }   try {     $ObjOut = @ Get-ADObject -Filter { Name -eq $ObjName -and        ObjectClass -eq $Type } -EA Stop   [ 186 ]       if $ObjOut.count -eq 0  {       $OutputObj.IsFound = $false     }      if $ObjOut.Count -gt 1  {       $OutputObj.IsFound = $false       Write-Verbose "Multiple objects found with the name          $ObjName"     }      if $ObjOut.Count -eq 1  {       $OutputObj.IsFound = $true     }   } catch {     $OutputObj.IsFound = $false   }   $OutputObj  select Name, ObjectClass, IsFound } }  Usage     To check whether a user account exists, use the following command:  Test-ADObject -Name DaveW -Type User     To check whether a computer account exists, use the following command:  Test-ADObject -Name TIBDC2 -Type Computer     To pass the input names from a text file, c:\temp\users.txt to the   command prompt, use the following command: Test-ADObject -Name  Get-Content c:\temp\users.txt  -Type User     To export the test results into an Excel file, use the following command:  Test-ADObject -Name  Get-Content c:\temp\users.txt  -Type User       Export-CSV c:\temp\User-Output.csv -NotypeInformation  [ 187 ]   Getting membership of a user, computer,  and group The function used in this section will help in finding out the group membership of  users, computers, or groups. The output of this function is the same as what you will  see in the MemberOf tab in the object properties. This function takes two types of  input. The first one is the Name parameter and it takes a list of objects for which you  want to query the membership details. The second one is the Type parameter, which  indicates the class of the objects that you supplied to the Name parameter:  Function Get-ADobjectMembership { [CmdletBinding  ] param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=0 ]   [string[]]$Name,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=1 ]   [ValidateSet "User","Group","Computer" ]   [string]$Type   Foreach $ObjName in $Name  {     try {         $MemberOf = @ Get-ADObject -Filter { Name -eq $ObjName  -and ObjectClass -eq $Type} -Properties MemberOf -EA Stop  select  -ExpandProperty MemberOf          if !$MemberOf  {             Write-Warning "$ObjName is not member of any Groups"             Continue         }         foreach $Group in $MemberOf  {             $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property                @{                     Name = $ObjName;                     MemberOf = $null                 }             $GroupName =  Get-ADGroup -Identity $Group -EA               Stop .Name             $OutputObj.MemberOf = $GroupName             $OutputObj         }     } catch {         Write-Warning "Failed to query Membership of $ObjName. $_"         Continue     } } }  [ 188 ]   Usage After copying the preceding code to PowerShell Window, you can use it to query the  membership details of an AD object, as follows:     To query the groups that a user belongs to, use the following command:  PS C:\> Get-ADobjectMembership -Name LabUser100 -Type User     To query the groups that a computer belongs to, use the following command:  PS C:\> Get-ADobjectMembership -Name COMP1 -Type Computer     To query the groups that a group belongs to, use the following command:  PS C:\> Get-ADobjectMembership -Name ChildGroup1 -Type Group  You can pass multiple names to the Name parameter either as comma-separated  values or by reading from a text file.  Resetting the password for multiple user  accounts Often, Windows administrators get requests to reset the password for a bunch  of users. You can do this via a GUI approach if you have the time and patience.  Otherwise, use the following function, which is an efficient way to do this. This  function prompts for the password that you want to set for the users. This password  should match the password complexity policy of your domain. You can pass the  list of users to the UserName parameter either as a Comma-Separated Value or by  reading from a text file:  Function Reset-ADuserPassword { [CmdletBinding  ] Param      [string[]]$UserName   $Password = Read-Host "Enter the password that you want to set for the  users" -AsSecureString foreach $User in $UserName  {     try {         Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $User -Reset -NewPassword            $Password -EA Stop         Write-Host "Password successfully changed for $user"     } catch {         Write-Warning "Failed to reset password for $user. $_"     } } }  [ 189 ]   Usage Copy the preceding code into PowerShell Window and reset a user account  password with the following command:  PS C:\> Reset-ADuserPassword -UserName spamarth  You can reset password for multiple user accounts by passing the list of usernames  to the -UserName parameter.  Bulk creation of user accounts In Chapter 2, Managing User and Computer Objects, we discussed the procedure  to create user accounts in bulk. The code discussed here gives you a high-level  overview of what is needed to read details from a CSV file and create user accounts  using those details. The script in the following code is a much enhanced version and  gives all the required code to create user accounts in bulk. One thing to note here  is, as part of the account creation process, we are only setting up a few properties.  But the real-time requirements might be different. So, you can use the code here as  a sample reference and add more properties as you need so that you can adopt it  in your environment. The input BulkUserCreation.csv file, which is used by this  script, is also available along with the code samples. You can download it along   with the script and make modifications accordingly.  Another thing to note here is that this script sets a default password for all the  accounts created and keeps them in a disabled state. You can have a separate   script to reset the password for users and enable them:  Save this code into a file and name as PS1 Ex : Invoke-ADBulkUserCreation.ps1 [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=0 ]   [ValidateScript {Test-Path $_} ]   [string[]]$CSVFilePath   try {   $CSVData = @ Import-CSV -Path $CSVFilePath -EA Stop      Write-Host "Successfully imported entries from $CSVFilePath"     Write-Host "Total no. of entries in CSV are :        $ $CSVData.count " } catch {     Write-Host "Failed to read from the CSV file $CSVFilePath.        Script exiting"  [ 190 ]       return }  foreach $Entry in $CSVData  { Verify that mandatory properties are defined for each object $Name = $Entry.Name $SamAccountName = $Entry.SAMAccountName $GivenName = $Entry.GivenName $SurName = $Entry.LastName $Email = $Entry.Email $StreetAddress = $Entry.Address $City = $Entry.City $Country = $Entry.Country $State = $Entry.State $Company = $Entry.Company $EmployeeID = $Entry.EmployeeID $Path = $Entry.OUName $Password = "Randompwd1$"  if !$Name  {     Write-Warning "$Name is not provided. Continue to the next        record"     Continue } if !$SamAccountName  {     Write-Warning "$SamAccountName is not provided. Continue to        the next record"     Continue } if $Country.Length -ne 2  {     Write-Warning "Country code should be of 2 characters only.        Setting it to US for now"     $Country = "US" } try {     New-ADUser -Name $Name `                 -SamAccountName $SamAccountName `                 -GivenName $GivenName `                 -Surname $SurName `                 -EmailAddress $Email `                 -AccountPassword  ConvertTo-SecureString -String                    $Password -AsPlainText -Force  `                 -StreetAddress $StreetAddress `                 -City $City `  [ 191 ]                   -State $State `                 -Country $Country `                 -Company $Company `                 -EmployeeID $EmployeeID `                 -Enabled $false `                 -Path $Path     Write-host "$Name : User Account created successfully" } catch {     Write-Warning "$Name : Error occurred while creating account.        $_" } }  Usage Save the preceding code into a file called Invoke-ADBulkUserCreation.ps1 and  prepare the input CSV with the required user creation details. The input CSV  template is available along with the code samples that you got with this book. Once  the file is ready, you can execute the script to read details from the CSV and create  user accounts, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\scripts> .\Invoke-ADBulkUserCreation.ps1 -CSVFilePath      C:\scripts\BulkUserCreation.csv  The preceding command reads details from the C:\scripts\BulkUserCreation.csv   file and creates the user accounts. The output will show whether the creation is  successful or not.  Getting the password expiry date of user  accounts The function discussed in this section helps in retrieving the password expiry date  of the users in the domain. The good thing with this function is that it makes use  of the msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed attribute of the user accounts  to determine the password expiry date. This attribute stores a dynamic value that  indicates the date and time when the password of the user is going to expire. This  value will be in the FileTime format. This function looks for user accounts that are  enabled and has the PasswordNeverExpires attribute set to false:  Function Get-PasswordExpiryDetails { [CmdletBinding  ] Param     [ 192 ]   $Users = Get-ADUser -Filter {PasswordNeverExpires -eq $false -and      Enabled -eq $true} `-Properties msDS-     UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed,*  Foreach $User in $Users  {   $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{           UserName = $User.Name;           DisplayName = $null;           PwdExpirtyDate = $null;           PwdExpiryInDays = $Null         }   $ExpiryDate = [DateTime]::FromFileTime $User."msDS-     UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed"    $ExpirtyInDays =  $ExpiryDate -  Get-Date  .Days   $OutputObj.DisplayName = $User.DisplayName   $OutputObj.PwdExpirtyDate = $ExpiryDate   $OutputObj.PwdExpiryInDays = $ExpirtyInDays   $OutputObj } }  Usage Import the preceding function into any of the PowerShell Windows where you have  an Active Directory module and get the password expiry details of all the users in  the current domain using following command:  PS C:\> Get-PasswordExpiryDetails  The output of the preceding command displays the Name, DisplayName, Expiry in  days, and Date of Expiry fields of the user accounts. If you want to sort the results so the accounts that are going to expire first appear at  the top, then use the following command:  PS C:\> Get-PasswordExpiryDetails  Sort PwdExpiryIndays  UserName   PwdExpiryInDays DisplayName   PwdExpirtyDate --------   --------------- -----------   -------------- ChrisB                 -23 Chris Brown   19 10 2014 7:56:36 AM JohnM                  -23 John Miller   19 10 2014 7:56:36 AM Johnw                  -23 John Williams 19 10 2014 7:18:07 AM Labuser100              39               21 12 2014 12:50:53 AM DaveW                   39 Dave Williams 21 12 2014 1:20:32 AM  PS C:\>  [ 193 ]   As you can see in the preceding command, the accounts that are already expired are  shown at the top. Export the results into a CSV file, if you are more comfortable with  Excel and want to do further filtering there.  The results can be exported by piping the output to the Export-CSV cmdlet.  Finding all the disabled user accounts Finding disabled user accounts in Active Directory is very simple. Each user object  returned by the Get-ADuser cmdlet will have an Enabled property, which holds the  value False when the user account is in the disabled state. Examining this value for  all the user accounts in the domain will tell us how many accounts are currently in  the disabled state.  The following script will query the current domain for disabled users and the exports  to the CSV filename disabled-users.csv in the C:\temp folder. Make sure that the  c:\temp folder exists, or you change the $OutputFilePath variable's value in the  code to a folder path where you want the output to be placed:  Function Find-DisabledUsers { [CmdletBinding  ] param    $OutputFilePath = "c:\temp\Disabled-Users.csv" Add-Content -Path $OutputFilePath -Value "UserName, DisplayName,      DistinguishedName" $DisabledUsers = Get-ADUser -Filter { Enabled -eq $false } -     Properties DisplayName foreach $User in $disabledUsers  { Add-Content -Path $OutputFilePath -Value  "{0},{1},'{2}'" -f      $User.Name, $User.DisplayName, $User.DistinguishedName  } }  Output The preceding code helps you in identifying the disabled accounts in the domain.  It searches Active Directory for disabled accounts and writes the details to the c:\ temp\Disabled-Users.csv file. This function doesn't require any arguments.  Executing the command shown in the following code will generate the output:  PS C:\> Find-DisabledUsers  If the output file already exists, it appends the data to it.  [ 194 ]   Getting all domain controllers and their  site names in the forest The function discussed in this section is a simple wrapper on top of the   Get-ADDomainController cmdlet to query all the domain controllers in forest   and display frequently referred-to details, such as DC name, domain name, site  name—whether these names are global catalog  servers or not—and reachability   of the domain controller:  Function Get-DCDetails { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    $Domains =  Get-ADForest .Domains $DCs = $Domains  % { Get-ADDomainController -Filter * -Server $_      } foreach $DC in $DCs  {   $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{           DCName = $User.Name;           DCDomain = $null;           IsGC = $null;           SiteName = $Null;           IsOnline = $null         }   if Test-Connection -Computer $DC -Count 1 -quiet  {     $OutputObj.IsOnline = $true   } else {     $OutputObj.IsOnline = $false   }     $OutputObj.DCName = $DC.HostName   $OutputObj.DCDomain = $DC.Domain   $OutputObj.IsGC = $DC.IsGlobalCatalog   $OutputObj.SiteName = $DC.Site   $OutputObj } }  Usage The preceding code will display DC details in the forest. You just need to copy the  code into a PowerShell Window and call it with a function name, as shown in the  following command:  PS C:\> Get-DCDetails  [ 195 ]   One thing to remember here is that since the Get-ADDomainController cmdlet  requires permissions to connect to all the DCs, you need to run this cmdlet as an  Enterprise administrator; otherwise, the command execution will fail.  Moving objects from one OU to another Often, Active Directory objects are moved between different OUs for reorganization  purposes. The following script searches the AD for the given objects and moves   them to the mentioned OU target. This script works for user, computer, and group  object types:  Function Move-ObjectsToOU { [CmdletBinding  ] param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=0 ]   [string[]]$Name,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=1 ]   [ValidateSet "User","Group","Computer" ]   [string]$Type,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=2 ]   [string]$TargetOUPath   if [ADSI]::Exists "LDAP:  {0}" -f $TargetOUPath   {   Foreach $ObjectName in $Name  {     try {       $Object = Get-ADObject -Filter { Name -eq $ObjectName -and          ObjectClass -eq $Type } -EA Stop       Move-ADObject -Identity $Object -TargetPath $TargetOUPath -         EA Stop       Write-Host "$ObjectName : Moved successfully to target OU"     } catch {       Write-Warning "Cannot move $ObjectName"}     } } else {   Write-Warning "The target OU not found. Script exiting" } }  [ 196 ]   Usage     To move users in a text file to LAB OU, use the following command:  Move-ObjectsToOU -Name  get-content c:\temp\users.txt  -Type      User -TargetOUPath "OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad"     To move computers in a text file to LAB OU, use the following command: Move-ObjectsToOU -Name  get-content c:\temp\comps.txt  -Type      Computer -TargetOUPath "OU=Prod,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  Finding inactive computers in Active  Directory A computer's inactivity is decided based on when that computer account had its  password changed last time. A computer account changes its password in Active  Directory every 30 days by default. So, any computer that had its password last  set longer than 30 days ago, it will mean that the computer is not connected to the  network for some reason. It could be either decommissioned, crashed, or made  offline for troubleshooting. The following function will help you query computers  older than the given number of days:  Function Find-InactiveComputers { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [int]$DaysOlderThan   $older =  Get-Date .AddDays -$DaysOlderThan  Get-ADComputer -Filter { PasswordLastSet -lt $older }  select      Name, DistinguishedName }  Usage Query computers that are inactive for more than 40 days using following command:  Find-InactiveComputers -DaysOlderThan 40  This displays the name and distinguished name of the computer accounts that are  older than 40 days.  [ 197 ]   Creating groups in bulk Previously, we have seen bulk creation of users using PowerShell. A similar  requirement might come from creating security groups in bulk. The function given  in the following code helps in creating groups in a bulk fashion. It creates a security  group of a given scope  domain local, global, or universal  inside the default  user's container by default. They can be created in different locations in the Active  Directory structure by updating the $TargetOU variable's value with the DN of the  OU where you want to create them:  Function Invoke-ADBulkGroup { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true, Position = 0 ]   [String[]]$GroupName,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true, Position = 1 ]   [ValidateSet "DomainLocal","Global","Universal" ]   [string]$GroupScope   Change the value of $TargetOU variable to the DN of the path      where you want the groups to be created If you leave it, it will create in default users container. $TargetOU =  Get-ADDomain .UsersContainer $TargetOU = "OU=Prod1,DC=techibee,DC=ad"  if ! [ADSI]::Exists "LDAP:  $TargetOU"    {   Write-Warning "The given OU $TargetOU not found. Exiting"   return }  Foreach $Group in $GroupName  { try {   $GroupObj = Get-ADGroup -Identity $Group -EA Stop   if $GroupObj  {     Write-Warning "$Group : Group already exists. Cannot create        another with same name"     Continue   } } catch {   try {     New-ADGroup -Name $Group -GroupScope $GroupScope -EA Stop     Write-Host "$Group : Successfully Created"   } catch {     Write-Warning "$Group : An error occurred during creation"   } } } }  [ 198 ]   Usage To create multiple groups in one go, you can use the following command after  importing the preceding function into a PowerShell Window:  PS C:\> Invoke-ADBulkGroup -GroupName Sales-INDIA,Sales-US,Sales-     Singapore -GroupScope Global  Groups can be created by reading the names from the text file. Use the following  command that reads group names from the c:\temp\groups.txt file and creates  domain local security groups with these names:  PS C:\> Invoke-ADBulkGroup -GroupName  Get-Content      c:\temp\groups.txt  -GroupScope DomainLocal  This function first checks whether the group exists in Active Directory and then  proceeds with creating it.  Exporting an AD group member's details  to CSV Often, end users enquire about the membership of a particular group or list of  groups. It is the job of Windows administrators to help them with the information  in a format that is most suitable for them. We generally share such information in  Excel  or CSV format . But this CSV preparation is not an easy task if there are nested  members, and the number of groups you want to generate this report for are more.  The function discussed in the following code can help here. It takes a list of group  names as input and exports the membership details to a CSV file. At the time of  export, we can choose whether to export direct members only or nested members   as well:  Function Export-ADGroupMembers { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true ]   [String[]]$GroupName,   [Switch]$Nested   $MemArray = @   foreach $Group in $GroupName  {   try {     $GroupMem = @ Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $Group -       Recursive:$Nested -EA Stop      if !$GroupMem  {  [ 199 ]         Write-Warning "$Group has no members"       Continue     }     foreach $Mem in $GroupMem  {       $Mem = $Mem select name,  SamAccountName, objectClass        $Mem  Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name GroupName -         Value $Group       $MemArray += $Mem     }   } catch {     Write-Warning "Error occurred while querying $Group"   } }  $MemArray  select GroupName, name,  SamAccountName, objectClass        Export-CSV c:\temp\GroupMembeship.csv -NotypeInformation Write-Host "Output available at c:\temp\GroupMembeship.Csv" }  Usage The usage of this function is simple. After copying the preceding code to PowerShell  Window, just call name by passing its name of the group that you want to export   the membership to the group, as shown in the following command:  PS C:\> Export-ADGroupMembers -GroupName ChildGroup100  By default, it will export the direct members, and the exported file is available in the  c:\temp folder with the GroupMembeship.csv name. You can change this path in   the code if you want.  You can also export the nested membership of a group using the -Nested switch:  PS C:\> Export-ADGroupMembers -GroupName ChildGroup100 -Nested  Multiple group names can be specified either by a comma separating them or by  reading from a text file:  PS C:\> Export-ADGroupMembers -GroupName ChildGroup100,ChildGroup10 -     Nested  The output that is exported to the CSV contains details about the group name, its  member name, object class, and SamAccount name.  [ 200 ]   Finding empty groups in Active Directory The PowerShell function discussed in this section helps you to find out the groups  that have no members in them. This function has an optional switch parameter called  -Nested, which indicates that a group has to be queried recursively for membership  to determine whether it is empty or not. In some cases, a group can have another  group in it, which might be empty as well. This switch will come in handy to find  such cases:  Function Find-EmptyADGroups { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [switch]$Nested    $Groups = Get-ADGroup -Filter * Write-Host "`nBelow is the list of empty groups in Active      Directory`n`n" $Count = 0 foreach $Group in $Groups  {   $Members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $Group -Recursive:$Nested   if !$Members  {     $Group  select Name, DistinguishedName     $Count++   } } Write-Host "`n`n`nTotal no. of empty groups are : $Count`n`n`n" }  Usage The usage of this code is very simple. Just copy and paste the preceding code   into PowerShell Window where you have the Active Directory module imported,  then run the following command to check the groups that are empty even at the  -Nested level:  PS C:\> Find-EmptyADGroups -Nested  To find groups that don't have any direct members  includes groups  in them, use  the following command:  PS C:\> Find-EmptyADGroups  The output of both the preceding commands shows the name and distinguished  name of the groups that are empty. It also displays the number of empty groups it  found at the end of the output.  [ 201 ]   Verifying whether a user is a member of  the given group or not Sometimes, there comes a need to check whether a user account is member of the  particular AD group or not. If the group has no further groups in it, it is easy to  verify it from either the user account's Memberof or Groups Members tab in ADUC.  If the group has nested groups, it is difficult to go through each group and figure  out whether the user account is member or not. The difficulty increases when you  have multiple accounts to verify. The PowerShell function given in this section will  simplify this task. It takes a single or list of usernames and checks whether they  are members  including nested  of the given AD group. The output indicates the  username, group name, and whether a user is a member or not:  Function Test-IsGroupMember { [CmdletBinding  ] param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=0 ]   [string[]]$UserName,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true,Position=1 ]   [string]$GroupName    $GroupMembers = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $GroupName -Recursive       ? {$_.objectClass -eq "User" } if !$GroupMembers  {   Write-Warning "$GroupName : Group doesn't have any User      accounts as members" }  foreach $User in $UserName  { $OutputObj = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{         UserName = $User;         GroupName = $GroupName;         IsMember = $False       } foreach $Member in $GroupMembers  {   if $User -eq $Member.Name  {     $OutputObj.IsMember = $True   } } $OutputObj } }  [ 202 ]   Usage You can copy and paste the preceding code into the PowerShell Window and start  using it. To check whether a user account is part of a group called ChildGroup100,  use the following command:  PS C:\> Test-IsGroupMember -UserName labuser100 -GroupName      ChildGroup100  If you want to verify this for two or three users, use the command shown here:  PS C:\> Test-IsGroupMember -UserName labuser100,labuser120 -GroupName      ChildGroup100  You can also provide user's list from a text file using the following command:  PS C:\> Test-IsGroupMember -UserName  Get-Content c:\temp\users.txt       -GroupName ChildGroup100  The output is in object format, so you can easily export it to CSV using the   Export-CSV cmdlet.  Comparing AD groups' membership Sometimes, you might find a need to compare membership of two security groups.  This is generally required to find whether they are identical. This not only helps  in getting rid of duplicate groups, but also in troubleshooting permission issues.  The function discussed in the following code takes two group names as input and  compares their members. The output contains a report that shows the number of  objects that exist in both the groups, and the number of objects that are found in   the first group but not the second and vice versa:  Function Compare-ADGroups { [CmdletBinding  ] Param    [Parameter Mandatory=$true, Position = 0 ]   [String]$Group1,   [Parameter Mandatory=$true, Position = 1 ]   [String]$Group2,   [Parameter Position = 2 ]   [switch]$Nested   try {   $Group1Obj = @ Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $Group1 -     Recursive:$Nested -EA Stop   [ 203 ]     $Group2Obj = @ Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $Group2 -     Recursive:$Nested -EA Stop    } catch {     Write-Warning "Failed to query group members."     return   }   if !$Group1Obj  {     Write-Warning "$Group1 is empty. Nothing to Compare"     Continue   }   if !$Group2Obj  {     Write-Warning "$Group2 is empty. Nothing to Compare"     Continue   }   $DiffObj = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $Group1Obj `-     DifferenceObject $Group2Obj `-IncludeEqual   $CommonObj = @     $FoundIn1 = @     $FoundIn2 = @      foreach $Obj in $DiffObj  {     if $Obj.SideIndicator -eq "=="  {       $CommonObj +=$Obj     }     if $Obj.SideIndicator -eq "=>"  {       $FoundIn2 +=$Obj     }     if $Obj.SideIndicator -eq "<="  {       $FoundIn1 +=$Obj     }   }    Write-host "Members found in both the Groups :      $ $CommonObj.count "   Write-host ""   $CommonObj.InputObject  select Name,ObjectClass   Write-host ""   Write-host "Members found in $Group1 but not in $Group2  :      $ $FoundIn1.count "   Write-host ""   $FoundIn1.InputObject  select Name,ObjectClass   Write-host ""   Write-host "Members found in $Group2 but not in $Group1  :      $ $FoundIn2.count "   Write-host ""   $FoundIn2.InputObject  select Name,ObjectClass   Write-host "" }  [ 204 ]   Usage Using the preceding function is simple. After copying the preceding code into a  PowerShell Window where you have an Active Directory module imported, execute  the following command to compare the membership of two groups. Here, we are  comparing ChildGroup1 and TestGroup1:  PS C:\> Compare-ADGroups -Group1 ChildGroup1 -Group2 TestGroup1  As mentioned earlier, the preceding command compares the objects that are   added directly. If you would like to compare nested members as well, then use   the -Nested switch:  PS C:\> Compare-ADGroups -Group1 ChildGroup1 -Group2 TestGroup1 -     Nested  In both the preceding cases, the output will contain the Name and Object class of   the members that are found in both the groups and extra ones.  Resources for further learning Learning is the key to become expert in any topic, and it should be a continuous  exercise. There are several resources freely available on the Internet to learn about  PowerShell and managing Active Directory using it. In this section, let's look at some  of these resources using which you can further increase your knowledge.  PowerShell resources There are several good books available from Packt Publising that are based on  PowerShell. These books will help you to understand how to use the cmdlets  available in the Active Directory module from PowerShell's perspective. You should  definitely take a look at these books to get yourself familiarized with PowerShell.  You can find a few of them towards the end of the book.  Looking for some books to learn PowerShell?

This has lots of resources useful to learn PowerShell.     Visit Hey Scripting Guy's blog at http:  blogs.technet.com b   heyscriptingguy .  Active Directory resources To learn more about managing Active Directory using PowerShell, the help content  of cmdlets in the Active Directory module is the first source. An explanation about  each cmdlet, their parameters, and examples gives more details about the cmdlet   and their use cases.  To get help content of a cmdlet in the Active Directory module, use Get-Help:  Get-Help   -Full  You can also get the same content from the TechNet website at http:  technet. microsoft.com en-us library ee617195.aspx.  The preceding link contains help content of all the cmdlets. If you want to view help  for a given cmdlet, you can try the following command: Get-Help   -Online  Learning about these cmdlets is not everything. To manage Active Directory using  PowerShell, you should have sound knowledge of it. There are many good books on  Active Directory from Packt Publishing.  The TechNet gallery has good number of scripts to manage Active Directory.  Following are some of the links that you may want to look at scripts for   various purposes:     User Account Management  http:  goo.gl e2TiKM     Computer Account Management  http:  goo.gl K9ao3J     Groups Management  http:  goo.gl DJZTSt     Working with OUs  http:  goo.gl M1LcWh     Searching Active Directory  http:  goo.gl CSKAp1   [ 206 ]   You can get some more resources about managing Active Directory with Active  Directory from http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us scriptcenter  dd793613.aspx, which leads you to several other resources, logs, script galleries   including previous , and articles.  Also, there are some good blogs from individuals that give real-world examples   and insights. One such blog from a Microsoft PFE is http:  blogs.technet. com b ashleymcglone .  If you would like to work with SID history during the accounts migration process,  you can check out the SIDHistory module at https:  gallery.technet. microsoft.com scriptcenter PowerShell-Module-for-08769c67.  Above all, use your favorite search engine to get the sample code for specific  requirements. One suggestion is that you should always understand the code and  test it in a lab environment before trying it out in production. Without proper  understanding of the code and lack of testing, it can cause serious problems. This   is not just with PowerShell and is the same for any programming language.
