Web  servers  Web  How did  they begin? What networking protocols and programming languages work  behind the scenes to display a web page? This chapter provides an introduc-  tion to some of these topics and is a foundation for the information that web  developers need to know. You’ll be introduced to Hypertext Markup Language   HTML , the language used to create web pages; eXtensible Hypertext Markup  Language  XHTML , the most recent standardized version of HTML; and HTML5—  the newest draft version of HTML.  1  2  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  1.1 The Internet and the Web  The Internet  The Internet , the interconnected network of computer networks that spans the globe,  seems to be everywhere today. It has become part of our lives. You can’t watch televi-  sion or listen to the radio without being urged to visit a website. Even newspapers and  magazines have their place on the Internet.  Birth of the Internet  The Internet began as a network to connect computers at research facilities and  universities. Messages in this network would travel to their destination by multiple  routes, or paths. This configuration allowed the network to function even if parts of it  were broken or destroyed. In such an event, the message would be rerouted through  a functioning portion of the network while traveling to its destination. This network   was developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency  ARPA —and the ARPAnet  was born. Four computers  located at UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, University of  California Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah  were connected by the end  of 1969.  Growth of the Internet  As time went on, other networks, such as the National Science Foundation’s NSFnet,  were created and connected with the ARPAnet. Use of this interconnected network, or  Internet, was originally limited to government, research, and educational purposes.  The ban on commercial use of the Internet was lifted in 1991. The growth of the Internet  continues: Internet World Stats reported over 2 billion users, about 30% of the world’s  population, on the Internet in 2011. Figure 1.1 shows the growth of Internet use by  geographic area between 2000 and 2011.  Figure 1.1 Growth of Internet use  Statistics  from  http:  www.internetworldstats.com  .

The lifting of the restriction on commercial use of the Internet set the stage for future  electronic commerce: Businesses were now welcome on the Internet. However, the  Internet was still text based and not easy to use. The next set of developments solved  1.1 The Internet and the Web  3  Birth of the Web  VideoNote  Evolution of the Web  While working at CERN, a research facility in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee envisioned  a means of communication for scientists by which they could easily “hyperlink” to  another research paper or article and immediately view it. Berners-Lee created the  World Wide Web to fulfill this need. In 1991, Berners-Lee posted the code for the Web  in a newsgroup and made it freely available. This version of the World Wide Web used  Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  to communicate between the client computer and  the web server, used Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  to format the documents, and  was text based.  The First Graphical Browser  In 1993, Mosaic, the first graphical web browser  shown in Figure 1.2  , became available.   Figure 1.2 Mosaic:  The fi rst graphical  browser  Marc Andreessen and graduate students working at the National Center for  Supercomputing Applications  NCSA  at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign  developed Mosaic. Some individuals in this group later created another well-known web  browser—Netscape Navigator—which is an ancestor of today’s Mozilla Firefox browser.  Convergence of Technologies  By the early 1990s, personal computers with easy-to-use graphical operating systems   such as Microsoft’s Windows, IBM’s OS 2, and Apple’s Macintosh OS  were increas-  ingly available and affordable. Online service providers such as CompuServe, AOL, and  Prodigy offered low-cost connections to the Internet. The convergence of available com-  puter hardware, easy-to-use operating systems, low-cost Internet connectivity, the HTTP  protocol and HTML language, and a graphical browser made information on the Internet  much easier to access. The World Wide Web —the graphical user interface to information  stored on computers running web servers connected to the Internet—had arrived!  Who Runs the Internet?  You may be surprised that there is no single person “in charge” of the global inter-  connected network of computer networks known as the Internet. Instead, Internet  4  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  infrastructure standards are overseen by groups such as the Internet Engineering Task  Force  IETF  and the Internet Architecture Board  IAB  . The IETF is the principal body  engaged in the development of new Internet protocol standard specifications. It is an  open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and research-  ers concerned with the evolution of Internet architecture and the smooth operation of  the Internet. The actual technical work of the IETF is completed in its working groups.  These working groups are organized into areas by topic, such as security and routing.  The IAB is a committee of the IETF and provides guidance and broad direction to the  IETF. As a function of this purpose, the IAB is responsible for the publication of the  Request for Comments  RFC  document series. An RFC is a formal document from the  IETF that is drafted by a committee and subsequently reviewed by interested parties.  RFCs are available for online review at http:  www.ietf.org rfc.html . Some RFCs are  informational in nature, while others are meant to become Internet standards. In the  latter case, the final version of the RFC becomes a new standard. Future changes to the  standard must be made through subsequent RFCs.  T h e Internet  Corporation  http:  www.icann.org ,  for  Assigned  Numbers  and  Names    ICANN    ,  was created in 1998 and is a nonprofit organization. Its main function is to coordinate  the assignment of Internet domain names, IP address numbers, protocol parameters,  and protocol port numbers. Prior to 1998, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority   IANA  coordinated these functions. IANA still performs certain functions under the  guidance of ICANN and maintains a website at http:  www.iana.org .  Intranets and Extranets  Recall that the Internet is an interconnected network of computer networks that is glo-   bally available. When an organization needs the communication capabilities of the  Internet, but doesn’t want its information to be available to everyone, either an intranet  or extranet is appropriate.  An intranet is a private network that is contained within an organization or business. Its  purpose is to share organizational information and resources among coworkers. When  an intranet connects to the outside Internet, usually a gateway or firewall protects the  intranet from unauthorized access.  An extranet is a private network that securely shares part of an organization’s information  or operations with external partners such as suppliers, vendors, and customers. Extranets  can be used to exchange data, share information exclusively with business partners, and  collaborate with other organizations. Privacy and security are important issues in extranet  use. Digital certificates, encryption of messages, and virtual private networks  VPNs  are  some technologies used to provide privacy and security for an extranet. Digital certificates  and encryption used in e-commerce are discussed in Chapter 12 .  1.2 Web Standards and Accessibility  Just as with the Internet, no single person or group runs the World Wide Web. However,  t he World  Wide  Web  Consortium     http:  www.w3.org  ,  referred  to  as  the  W3C,  takes  a proactive role in developing recommendations and prototype technologies related to  the Web. Topics that the W3C addresses include web architecture, standards for web  1.2 Web Standards and Accessibility  5  design, and accessibility. In an effort to standardize web technologies, the W3C  logo  shown in Figure 1.3   produces specifications called recommendations.  W3C Recommendations  Figure 1.3 The  W3C logo  The W3C Recommendations are created in working groups with input from many major  corporations involved in building web technologies. These recommendations are not rules;  they are guidelines. Major software companies that build web browsers, such as Microsoft,  do not always follow the W3C Recommendations. This makes life difficult for web develop-  ers because not all browsers will display a web page in exactly the same way. The good  news is that there is a convergence toward the W3C Recommendations in new versions  of major browsers. There are even organized groups, such as The Web Standards Project,  http:  webstandards.org , whose mission is to promote W3C Recommendations  often called  Web standards  not only to the creators of browsers, but also to web developers and design-  ers. You’ll follow W3C Recommendations as you code web pages in this book. Following the  W3C Recommendations is the first step toward creating a website that is accessible.  Web Standards and Accessibility   The Web Accessibility Initiative  WAI    http:  www.w3.org WAI  , is a major area of work by the W3C. Since the Web has become an integral part of daily life, there is a need for  all individuals to be able to access it.  Focus on  Accessibility  The Web can present barriers to individuals with visual, auditory, physical, and  neurological disabilities. An accessible website provides accommodations that help  individuals overcome these barriers. The WAI has developed recommendations for  web content developers, web authoring tool developers, web browser developers,  and developers of other user agents to facilitate use of the Web by those with  special needs. See the WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  WCAG  at  http:  www.w3.org WAI WCAG20 glance WCAG2-at-a-Glance.pdf for a quick overview.  Accessibility and the Law  The Americans with Disabilities Act   ADA  of 1990 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits dis-  crimination against people with disabilities. The ADA requires that business, federal, and state  services are accessible to individuals with disabilities. A 1996 Department of Justice ruling    http:  www.justice.gov crt foia readingroom frequent_requests ada_coreletter cltr204.txt    Focus on  Accessibility  indicated that ADA accessibility requirements apply to Internet resources.  Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act was amended in 1998 to require that  U.S. government agencies give individuals with disabilities access to information  technology that is comparable to the access available to others. This law requires  developers creating information technology  including web pages  for use by the  federal government to provide for accessibility. The Federal IT Accessibility Initiative    http:  www.section508.gov   provides accessibility requirement resources for  information technology developers.  In recent years, state governments have also begun to encourage and promote  web accessibility. The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility  Act  IITAA  guidelines are an example of this trend.   See http:  www.dhs.state.il.us IITAA IITAAWebImplementationGuidelines.html .   6   Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  Universal Design for the Web  The Center for Universal Design defines universal design as “the design of products  and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, with-  out the need for adaptation or specialized design”   http:  www.ncsu.edu project   design-projects udi center-for-universal-design the-principles-of-universal-design   .  Examples of universal design are all around us. The cutouts on curbs that make it  possible for people in wheelchairs to access the street also benefit a person push-  ing a stroller or doing a little rollerblading   Figure 1.4  . Doors that open automatically  for people with mobility challenges also benefit people carrying packages. A ramp is  useful for a person in a wheelchair, a person dragging a rolling backpack or carry-on  bag, and so on.  Awareness of universal design by web developers has been  steadily increasing. Forward-thinking web developers design  with accessibility in mind because it is the right thing to do.  Providing access for visitors with visual, auditory, and other  challenges should be an integral part of web design rather than  an afterthought.  A person with visual difficulties may not be able to use graphi-  cal navigation buttons and may use a screen reader device to  provide an audible description of the web page. By making a  few simple changes, such as providing text descriptions for the  images and perhaps providing a text navigation area at the bot-  tom of the page, web developers can make the page accessible.  Figure 1.4 Inline skaters benefi t from universal  Often, providing for accessibility increases the usability of the  design  website for all visitors.  Accessible websites, with alternative text for images, headings used in an organ-  ized manner, and captions or transcriptions for multimedia features, are more eas-  ily used not only by visitors with disabilities, but also by visitors using a browser  Focus on  Accessibility  on a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. Finally, accessible websites may be  more thoroughly indexed by search engines, which can be helpful in bringing new  visitors to a site. As this text introduces web development and design techniques,  corresponding web accessibility and usability issues are discussed.  1.3 Information on the Web  These days anyone can publish just about anything on the Web. In this section we’ll  explore how you can tell if the information you’ve found is reliable and how you can use  that information.  Reliability and Information on the Web  There are many websites—but which ones are reliable sources of information? When  visiting websites to find information, it is important not to take everything at face value    Figure 1.5  .     Figure 1.5  .  1.3 Information on the Web  7  follows;  Questions to ask about web resources are listed as  ● Is the organization credible?  Anyone can post anything on the Web! Choose your  information sources wisely. First, evaluate the credibility of  the website itself. Does it have its own domain name, such  as http:  mywebsite.com , or is it a free website consisting  of just a folder of fi les hosted on a free web server? The  URL of a site hosted on a free web server usually includes  part of the free web server’s name and might begin  with something such as http:  mysite.tripod.com or  http:  www.angelfi re.com foldername mysite . Information  obtained from a website that has its own domain name will  Figure 1.5 Who really updated that web page  usually  but not always  be more reliable than information  you are viewing?  obtained from a free website.  Evaluate the type of domain name: Is it for a nonprofi t organization  .org ,  a business  .com or .biz , or an educational institution  .edu ? Businesses  may provide information in a biased manner, so be careful. Nonprofi t  organizations and schools will sometimes treat a subject more  objectively.  ● How recent is the information?  Another item to look at is the date the web page was created or last updated.  Although some information is timeless, very often a web page that has not  been updated for several years is outdated and may not be the best source of  information.  ● Are there links to additional resources?  Hyperlinks indicate websites with supporting or additional information that can   be helpful to you in your research as you explore a topic. Look for these types of  hyperlinks to aid your studies.  ● Is it Wikipedia?  Wikipedia is a good place to begin research, but don’t accept what you read there  for fact, and avoid using Wikipedia as a resource for academic assignments. Why?  Well, except for a few protected topics, anyone can update Wikipedia with any-  thing! Usually it all gets sorted out eventually—but be aware that the information  you read may not be valid.  Feel free to use Wikipedia to begin exploring a topic, but then scroll down to the  bottom of the Wikipedia web page and look for “References”—and then explore  those websites and others that you may fi nd. As you gather information on these  sites, also consider the other criteria: credibility, domain name, timeliness, and  links to additional resources.  Ethical Use of Information on the Web  This wonderful technology called the World Wide Web provides us with information,  graphics, and music—all virtually free  after you pay your Internet service provider,  Focus on  Ethics  8  information:  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  of course . Let’s consider the following issues relating to the ethical use of this  ● Is it acceptable to copy someone’s graphic to use on your own website?  ● Is it acceptable to copy someone’s website design to use on your own site or on  a client’s site?  of it, as your own writing?  a derogatory manner?  ● Is it acceptable to copy an essay that appears on a web page and use it, or parts  ● Is it acceptable to insult someone on your website or link to that person’s site in  The answer to all these questions is no. Using someone’s graphic without permis-  sion is the same as stealing it. In fact, if you link to it, you are actually using up  some of the site’s bandwidth and may be costing the owner money. Instead, ask  the owner of the website for permission to use the graphic. If permission is granted,  store the graphic on your own website and be sure to indicate the source of the  graphic when you display it on your web page. The key is to request permission  before using someone else’s resources. Copying the website design of another per-  son or company is also a form of stealing. Any text or graphic on a website is auto-  matically copyrighted in the United States, regardless of whether a copyright symbol  appears on the site or not. Insulting a person or company on your website or linking  to the person’s or company’s website in a derogatory manner could be considered a  form of defamation.   Issues like these, related to intellectual property, copyright, and freedom of  speech, are regularly discussed and decided in courts of law. Good Web etiquette  requires that you ask permission before using others’ work, give credit for what you  use  “fair use” in the U.S. copyright law , and exercise your freedom of speech in a  manner that is not harmful to others. The World Intellectual Property Organization   WIPO  , http:  wipo.int , is dedicated to protecting intellectual property rights  internationally.  What if you’d like to retain ownership, but make it easy for others to use or adapt  your work? Creative Commons , http:  creativecommons.org , is a nonprofit organiza-  tion that provides free services that allow authors and artists to register a type of  a copyright license called a Creative Commons license. There are several licenses  to choose from, depending on the rights you wish to grant. The Creative Commons  license informs others as to exactly what they can and cannot do with your creative  work.

Is the concept of universal design important to web developers? Explain your answer.  A network consists of two or more computers connected for the purpose of communicat-  ing and sharing resources. Common components of a network are shown in Figure 1.6  1.5 The Client Server Model  9  1.4 Network Overview  and include the following:  ● Server computer s   ● Client workstation computer s   ● Shared devices such as printers  Figure 1.6  Common  components of a  network  ● Networking devices  router and switch  and the media that connect them  The clients are the computer workstations used by individuals, such as a personal  computer  PC  on a desk. The server receives requests from client computers for   resources such as files. Computers used as servers are usually kept in a protected,  secure area and are accessed only by network administrators. Networking devices such  as hubs and switches provide network connections for computers, and routers direct  information from one network to another. The media connecting the clients, servers,  peripherals, and networking devices may consist of copper cables, fiber optic cables,  or wireless technologies.  Networks vary in scale. A local area network  LAN  is usually confined to a single  building or group of connected buildings. Your school computer lab may use a LAN. If  you work in an office, you probably use a computer connected to a LAN. A wide area  network  WAN  is geographically dispersed and usually uses some form of public or  commercial communications network. For example, an organization with offices on both  the East and West Coasts of the United States probably uses a WAN to provide a link  between the LANs at each of the offices.  A backbone is a high-capacity communication link that carries data gathered from  smaller links that interconnect with it. On the Internet, a backbone is a set of paths that  local or regional networks connect to for long-distance interconnection. The Internet is  a group of interconnected networks with very high-speed connectivity provided by the  Internet backbones.  1.5 The Client Server Model  The term client server dates from the last millennium  the 1980s  and refers to per-  sonal computers joined by a network. “Client server” can also describe a relation-  ship between two computer programs—the client and the server. The client requests  10  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  some type of service  such as a file or database access  from the server. The server  fulfills the request and transmits the results to the client over a network. While both  the client and the server programs can reside on the same computer, typically they  run on different computers   Figure 1.7  . It is common for a server to handle requests  from multiple clients.  The Internet is a great example of client server architecture at work. Consider the  following scenario: An individual is at a computer using a web browser client to  access the Internet. The individual uses the web browser to visit a website, let’s say  http:  www.yahoo.com . The server is the web server program running on the computer  with an IP address that corresponds to yahoo.com . It is contacted, locates the web  page and related resources that were requested, and responds by sending them to  the individual.  Figure 1.7 Web  client and web  Browser  server  Request  Server  Response  Web Client  Web Server   Here’s how to distinguish between web clients and web servers:  ● Connected to the Internet when needed  ● Usually runs web browser  client  software such as Internet Explorer or Firefox  Web Client  ● Uses HTTP  Web Server  ● Requests web pages from a server  ● Receives web pages and files from a server  ● Continually connected to the Internet  ● Runs web server software  such as Apache or Internet Information Server   ● Uses HTTP  ● Receives a request for the web page  ● Responds to the request and transmits the status code, web page, and  associated files  When clients and servers exchange files, they often need to indicate the type of file that  is being transferred; this is done through the use of a MIME type. Multipurpose Internet  Mail Extensions  MIME  are rules that allow multimedia documents to be exchanged  among many different computer systems. MIME was initially intended to extend the  1.6 Internet Protocols  11  original Internet e-mail protocol, but it is also used by HTTP. MIME provides for the  exchange of seven different media types on the Internet: audio, video, image, applica-  tion, message, multipart, and text. MIME also uses subtypes to further describe the  data. The MIME type of a web page is text html. MIME types of GIF and JPEG images are  image gif and image jpeg, respectively.  A web server determines the MIME type of a file before the file is transmitted to the web  browser. The MIME type is sent along with the document. The web browser uses the  MIME type to determine how to display the document.  How does information get transferred from the web server to the web browser? Clients   such as web browsers  and servers  such as a web server  exchange information  through the use of communication protocols such as HTTP, TCP, and IP, which are intro-  duced in the next section.  1.6 Internet Protocols  Protocols are rules that describe how clients and servers communicate with each other  over a network. There is no single protocol that makes the Internet and Web work; a  number of protocols with specific functions are needed.  File Transfer Protocol  FTP   File Transfer Protocol  FTP  is a set of rules that allow files to be exchanged between  computers on the Internet. Unlike HTTP, which is used by web browsers to request web  pages and their associated files in order to display a web page, FTP is used simply to  move files from one computer to another. Web developers commonly use FTP to transfer  web page files from their computers to web servers. FTP is also commonly used to down-  load programs and files from other servers to individual computers.  E-mail Protocols  Most of us take e-mail for granted, but there are two servers involved in its smooth   Most of us take e-mail for granted, but there are two servers involved in its smooth  functioning: an incoming mail server and an outgoing mail server. When you send  e-mail to others, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  SMTP  is used. When you receive  e-mail, Post Office Protocol  POP; currently POP3   and Internet Message Access  Protocol  IMAP  can be used.  Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP   HTTP is a set of rules for exchanging files such as text, images, audio, video, and  other multimedia on the Web. Web browsers and web servers usually use this pro-  tocol. When the user of a web browser requests a file by typing a website address  or clicking on a hyperlink, the browser builds an HTTP request and sends it to the  server. The web server in the destination machine receives the request, does any  necessary processing, and responds with the requested file and any associated  media files.  12  TCP  IP  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol  TCP IP   Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol  TCP IP  has been adopted as the  official communication protocol of the Internet. TCP and IP have different functions that  work together to ensure reliable communication over the Internet.  The purpose of TCP is to ensure the integrity of network communication. TCP starts by  breaking files and messages into individual units called packets . These packets  see  Figure 1.8   contain information such as the destination, source, sequence number, and  checksum values used to verify the integrity of the data.  Figure 1.8 TCP  packet  TCP is used together with IP to transmit files efficiently over the Internet. IP takes over  after TCP creates the packets, using IP addressing to send each packet over the Internet  via the best path at the particular time. When the destination address is reached, TCP  verifies the integrity of each packet by using the checksum, requests a resend if a packet  is damaged, and reassembles the file or message from the multiple packets.  Working in harmony with TCP, IP is a set of rules that controls how data is sent between  computers on the Internet. IP routes a packet to the correct destination address. Once  sent, the packet gets successively forwarded to the next closest router  a hardware  device designed to move network traffic  until it reaches its destination.  Each device connected to the Internet has a unique numeric IP address . These  addresses consist of a set of four groups of numbers, called octets. The current ver-  sion of IP, Internet Protocol Version 4  IPv4  , uses 32-bit  binary digit  addressing.  This results in a decimal number in the format of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, where each xxx is a  value from 0 to 255. Theoretically, this system allows for at most 4 billion possible IP   addresses  although many potential addresses are reserved for special uses . However,  even this many addresses will not be enough to meet the needs of all of the devices  expected to be connected to the Internet in upcoming years.  IP Version 6  IPv6  will be the next standard IP protocol and will provide a huge increase  in the number of possible addresses and many technological advances. IPv6 was  designed as an evolutionary set of improvements to the current IPv4 and is backwardly  compatible with it. Service providers and Internet users can update to IPv6 independ-  ently without having to coordinate with each other. IPv6 provides for more Internet  addresses because the IP address is lengthened from 32 bits to 128 bits. This means  that there are potentially 2 128 unique IP addresses possible, or 340,282,366,920,938,  463,463,347,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.  Now there will be enough IP addresses  for everyone’s PC, notebook, cell phone, tablet, toaster, and so on!   1.7 Uniform Resource Identifiers and Domain Names  13  The IP address of a device may correspond to a domain name. The Domain Name  System  DNS  associates these IP addresses with the text-based URLs and domain  names you type into a web browser address box. For example, at the time this book  was written, one of Google’s IP addresses was 74.125.73.106. You can enter this number  in the address text box in a web browser  as shown in Figure 1.9  , press Enter, and the  Google home page will display. Of course, it’s much easier to type “google.com,” which  is why domain names such as google.com were created in the first place! Since long  strings of numbers are difficult for humans to remember, the Domain Name System was  introduced as a way to associate text-based names with numeric IP addresses.  Figure 1.9  Entering an IP  address in a web   browser  1.7  Uniform Resource Identifiers  and Domain Names  URIs and URLs  A Uniform Resource Identifier  URI  identifies a resource on the Internet. A Uniform  Resource Locator  URL  is a type of URI which represents the network location of a  resource such as a web page, a graphic file, or an MP3 file. The URL consists of the  protocol, the domain name, and the hierarchical location of the file on the web server.  The URL http:  www.webdevfoundations.net , shown in Figure 1.10 , denotes the use of HTTP  protocol and the web server named www at the domain name of webdevfoundations.net.  In this case, the root file  usually index.html or index.htm  of the chapter1 directory will be  displayed.  Figure 1.10 URL  Describing a fi le  within a folder  14  Domain Names  to a device.  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  A domain name locates an organization or other entity on the Internet. The purpose of  the Domain Name System  DNS  is to divide the Internet into logical groups and under-  standable names by identifying the exact address and type of the organization. The DNS  associates the text-based domain names with the unique numeric IP address assigned  Let’s consider the domain name www.yahoo.com . The “.com” is the top-level domain  name. The portion “yahoo.com” is the domain name that is registered to Yahoo! and  “yahoo” is considered a second-level domain name. The “www” is the name of the web  server  sometimes called web host server   at the yahoo.com domain. Taken all together,  www.yahoo.com is considered to be a fully qualified domain name  FQDN  .  Top-Level Domain Names  A top-level domain  TLD  identifies the rightmost part of the domain name, starting  with the final period. A TLD is either a generic top-level domain, such as .com for  commercial, or a country-code top-level domain, such as .fr for France. ICANN administers  the generic top-level domains shown in Table 1.1 .  Table 1.1 Top-level domains  Generic TLD  Used By  .aero  Air-transport industry  .asia  .biz  .cat  Businesses  Pan-Asia and Asia Pacific community  Catalan linguistic and cultural community   Corresponds to a .com website—the .mobi site is designed for easy access  Restricted to accredited degree-granting institutions of higher education  Commercial entities  Cooperative  Restricted to government use  Unrestricted use  International organization  rarely used   Human resources management community  Restricted to military use  .com  .coop  .edu  .gov  .info  .int  .jobs  .mil  .mobi  .org  .post  .pro  .tel  .xxx  15  by mobile devices  .museum  Museums  .name  Individuals  .net  Nonprofit entities  Entities associated with network support of the Internet, usually Internet  service providers or telecommunication companies  Universal Postal Union, an agency of the United Nations  Professionals such as accountants, physicians, and lawyers  Contact information for individuals and businesses  .travel  Travel industry  Adult entertainment  1.7 Uniform Resource Identifiers and Domain Names  The .com, .org, and .net TLD designations are currently used on the honor system, which  means that, for example an individual who owns a shoe store  not related to network-  ing  can register shoes.net.  Country-Code Top-Level Domain Names  Two-character country codes have also been assigned as TLD names. These codes were   originally intended to be meaningful by designating the geographical location of the  individual or organization that registered the name. In practice, however, it is fairly easy  to obtain a domain name with a country-code TLD that is not local to the registrant. See  http:  register.com and many other domain name registration companies for examples.  Table 1.2 lists some popular country codes used on the Web.  Table 1.2 Country codes  Country Code  TLD  Country  Australia  Germany  India  Japan  .au  .de  .in  .jp  .nl  .us  .eu  The Netherlands  United States  European Union  a group of countries rather than a single country   The IANA website at http:  www.iana.org cctld cctld-whois.htm has a complete list of  country-code TLDs. Domain names with country codes are often used for municipali-  ties, schools, and community colleges in the United States. For example, the domain  name www.harper.cc.il.us denotes, from right to left, the United States, Illinois,  community college, Harper, and the web server named “www” as the site for Harper  The DNS associates domain names with IP addresses. The following happens each time  College in Illinois.  a new URL is typed into a web browser:  1. The DNS is accessed.  2. The corresponding IP address is obtained and returned to the web browser.  3. The web browser sends an HTTP request to the destination computer with the  corresponding IP address.  4. The HTTP request is received by the web server.  5. The necessary files are located and sent by HTTP responses to the web browser.  6. The web browser renders and displays the web page and associated files.  The next time you wonder why it is taking so long to display a web page, think about all  of the processing that goes on behind the scenes.  16   Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  FAQ Will there be any new TLDs soon?  ICANN has approved the expansion of generic TLDs and announced that it will accept appli-  cations for new, customized TLDs. Think of the marketing possibilities—your organization’s  name, product, or service as a TLD! Sound too good to be true? Well, there’s a catch. With a  $185,000 application fee and an annual $25,000 fee, deep pockets are needed. Visit  http:  icann.org for more information.  1.8 Markup Languages  Markup languages consist of sets of directions that tell the browser software  and other  user agents such as mobile phones  how to display and manage a web document.  These directions are usually called tags and perform functions such as displaying  graphics, formatting text, and referencing hyperlinks.  Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML   SGML is a standard for specifying a markup language or tag set. SGML in itself is not  a document language, but a description of how to specify one and create a document  type definition  DTD . When Tim Berners-Lee created HTML, he used SGML to create the  specification.  Hypertext Markup Language  HTML   HTML is the set of markup symbols or codes placed in a file intended for display on a  web browser. The web browser renders the code in the HTML file and displays the web  page document and associated files. The W3C   http:  www.w3.org   sets the standards  for HTML.  Extensible Markup Language  XML   XML was developed by the W3C as a flexible method to create common information  formats and share the format and the information on the Web. It is a text-based syntax  designed to describe, deliver, and exchange structured information. It is not intended  to replace HTML, but to extend the power of HTML by separating data from presenta-  tion. Using XML, developers can create whatever tags they need to describe their  information.  Extensible Hypertext Markup Language  XHTML   XHTML was developed by the W3C to reformulate HTML 4.01 as an application of XML. It  combines the formatting strengths of HTML 4.01 and the data structure and extensibil-  ity strengths of XML. The primary advantages of XHTML include the ability to extend the  language by creating new tags and the promise of increased platform interoperability as  mobile devices are used more frequently to access the Web.  1.9 Popular Uses of the Web  17  HTML5—the Newest Version of HTML  As this was being written, the W3C’s HTML Working Group  HTML WG  was busy creating  a draft recommendation for HTML5 , which is intended to be the successor to HTML4 and  will replace XHTML. HTML5 incorporates features of both HTML and XHTML, adds new   elements, provides new features such as form edits and native video, and is intended to  be backward compatible. Although this version still in draft form, much of the proposal  is stable and supported by modern browsers. You’ll learn to use HTML5 syntax as you  1.

Checkpoint 1.2  do not use the Web.  1.9 Popular Uses of the Web  E-Commerce  Continued growth is expected for e-commerce , which is the buying and selling  of goods and services on the Internet. Forrester Research projects that by 2014,  over $248 billion will be spent on online retail sales   http:  techcrunch.com   2010 03 08 forrester-forecast-online-retail-sales-will-grow-to-250-billion-by-2014   .  With over 2 billion people online worldwide, as reported by Internet World Stats    http:  www.internetworldstats.com emarketing.htm  , that’s quite a few potential  shoppers! As mobile web access becomes more commonplace, e-commerce will be reg-  ularly done not only from stationary computers, but also from portable devices—tablets,  netbooks, smartphones, and technology we haven’t even imagined yet.  Mobile Access  Accessing the Web with devices other than the standard desktop, notebook, and net-  book computers is a growing trend. Gartner predicts that by 2013, mobile phones  includ-  ing smartphones and browser-equipped phones  will “overtake PCs as the most common  Web access device worldwide”   http:  www.gartner.com it page.jsp?id=1278413  .  SearchBlog reported a Google 2011 projection that “between 15% and 30% of  site traffic will come from mobile devices within eighteen months”    http:  www.mediapost.com publications ?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=147794  .  Bloomberg Businessweek reported that electronics manufacturers expect a huge  demand for tablet computers  such as the Apple iPad, Motorola Xoom, and Blackberry  Playbook  and anticipate $49 billion in sales by 2015   http:  buswk.co fK2Q9e  . Web designers must consider how their pages will display and function not only on personal  computers, but also on smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices.  Chapter 1 Introduction to the Internet and World Wide Web  18  Blogs  The trend of keeping a web log, or blog, has been driven by individuals as a forum for  personal expression. A blog is a journal that is available on the Web; it is a frequently  updated page with a chronological list of ideas and links. Blog topics range from poli-  tics to technical information to personal diaries. Blogs can focus on one subject or  range across a diverse group of topics—it’s up to the person, called a blogger, who  has created and maintains the blog. Bloggers usually update their blogs daily with  easy-to-use software designed to allow people with little or no technical background  to update and maintain a blog. Many blogs are hosted at blog communities such as  http:  www.blogger.com , http:  www.wordpress.com , and http:  www.tumblr.com .   Others are hosted at individual websites, such as the blog kept by the web designer Eric  Meyer at http:  meyerweb.com . Businesses have noted the value of blogs as communica-  tion and customer relationship tools. Companies such as Adobe   http:  feeds.adobe.com   and I B M    https:  www.ibm.com developerworks mydeveloperworks blogs    utilize  blogs  in  this manner.  Wikis  A wiki is a website that can be updated immediately at any time by visitors, using a  simple form on a web page. Some wikis are intended for a small group of people,  such as the members of an organization. The most powerful wiki is Wikipedia    http:   wikipedia.org  , an online encyclopedia, which can be updated by anyone at  any time. Wikis are a form of social software in action—visitors sharing their collective  knowledge to create a resource freely used by all. While there have been isolated inci-  dents of practical jokes, and inaccurate information has occasionally been posted at  Wikipedia, the given information and linked resources are a good starting point when  exploring a topic.  Social Networking  Blogs and wikis provide web visitors with new methods for interacting with websites  and other people—a use referred to as social computing, or social networking . A trendy  activity these days is participating in a social networking site such as Facebook    http:  www.facebook.com   or LinkedIn   http:  www.linkedin.com  . Research firm eMarketer  predicts that by 2014, close to two-thirds of all Internet users will regularly access social  networking sites   http:  www.emarketer.com Report.aspx?code=emarketer_2000644  .  If it seems to you as if most of your friends are on Facebook, that may be  the case: As of 2011, Facebook had over 500 million active users     http:  www.digitalbuzzblog.com facebook-statistics-stats-facts-2011    . While  LinkedIn  was created with professional and business networking in mind, businesses  have also found it useful to create Facebook sites to promote their products and services.  Twitter   http:  www.twitter.com    is a social networking site for microblogging , or frequently communicating with a brief message  140 characters or less  called a tweet .  Twitter users  called twitterers  tweet to update a network of friends and followers  about their daily activities and observations. Twitter is not limited to personal use. The  business world has also discovered the marketing reach that Twitter can provide. Information  Week     http:  www.informationweek.com news hardware desktop 217801030    reported  that Dell attributes $3 million in sales to its use of Twitter.  1.9 Popular Uses of the Web  19  RSS  Really Simple Syndication, or Rich Site Summary  RSS  is used to create newsfeeds  from blog postings and other websites. The RSS feeds contain a summary of new  items posted to the site. The URL to the RSS feed is usually indicated by the letters  XML or RSS in white text within an orange rectangle. A newsreader is needed to access  the information. Some browsers, such as Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer  version  7 or later , can display RSS feeds. Commercial and shareware newsreader applications  are also available. The newsreader polls the feed URL at intervals and displays the   new headlines when requested. RSS provides web developers with a method to push  new content to interested parties and  hopefully  generate return visits to the site.  Podcasts are audio files on the web that take the format of an audio blog, radio  show, or interview. Podcasts are typically delivered by an RSS feed, but can also be  made available by providing the link to a recorded MP3 file on a web page. These  files can be saved to your computer or to an MP3 player  such as an iPod  for later  Podcasts  listening.  Web 2.0  Flickr   http:  www.flickr.com    and del.icio.us   http:  del.icio.us    are two social  software sites that provide information-sharing opportunities. Flickr, a photo-sharing  site, calls itself the “best way to store, search, sort, and share your photos.” Once  owned by Yahoo!, but sold to AVOS Systems in April 2011, del.icio.us is a collection of  users’ favorite sites, or bookmarks. Registered users post lists of favorites, share their  favorites with others, and discover new sites by looking at others’ favorites. Websites  such as Wikipedia, Flickr, Twitter, and del.icio.us are examples of what is called  Web 2.0 . While a consensus on the definition of Web 2.0 has yet to be reached,  think of it as the next step in the transition of the Web from isolated static websites  to a platform that utilizes technology to provide rich interfaces and social networking  opportunities.

You’ll  be introduced to Hypertext Markup Language  HTML , the language used to  create web pages; eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language  XHTML , the most  recent standardized version of HTML; and HTML5, the newest draft version  of HTML. The chapter begins with an introduction to the syntax of XHTML and  HTML5; continues with sample web pages; and introduces HTML structural,  phrase, and hyperlink elements as more example web pages are created. You  will learn more if you work along with the sample pages in the text. Coding HTML  is a skill, and every skill improves with practice.  23  24  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  2.1 HTML Overview  Markup languages consist of sets of directions that tell the browser software  and other  user agents such as mobile phones  how to display and manage a web document.  These directions are usually called tags and perform functions such as displaying graph-  ics, formatting text, and referencing hyperlinks.  The World Wide Web is composed of files containing Hypertext Markup Language  HTML   and other markup languages that describe web pages. Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML   using Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML . SGML prescribes a standard  format for embedding descriptive markup within a document and for describing the  structure of a document. SGML is not in itself a document language, but rather a  description of how to specify one and create a document type definition  DTD . The W3C    http:  www.w3c.org   sets the standards for HTML and its related languages. Like the  Web itself, HTML is in a constant state of change.  HTML  HTML is the set of markup symbols or codes placed in a file that is intended for dis-  play on a web page. These markup symbols and codes identify structural elements  such as paragraphs, headings, and lists. HTML can also be used to place media   such as graphics, video, and audio  on a web page and describe fill-in forms. The  browser interprets the markup code and renders the page. HTML permits the plat-  form-independent display of information across a network. No matter what type of  computer a web page was created on, any browser running on any operating system  can display the page.  Each individual markup code is referred to as an element , or tag . Each tag has a pur-  pose. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, the   symbols. Most tags come in  pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags act as containers and are some-  times referred to as container tags. For example, the text that is between the    and   tags on a web page would display in the title bar on the browser win-  dow. Some tags are used alone and are not part of a pair. For example, a   tag that  configures a line break on a web page is a stand-alone, or self-contained, tag and does  not have a closing tag. Most tags can be modified with attributes that further describe  their purpose.  XHTML  The most recent standardized version of HTML used today is eXtensible HyperText  Markup Language  XHTML  . XHTML uses the tags and attributes of HTML4 along with the  syntax of XML. HTML was originally developed to provide access to electronic  documents via a web browser. Web browsers that evolved along with HTML were written  to forgive coding errors, ignore syntax errors, and allow “sloppy” HTML code. Web  browsers contain many program instructions that are designed to ignore mistakes such  as missing ending tags and to guess how the developer meant the page to display.  These extra instructions are not a problem for a personal computer, which has relatively  large processing power. However, it could be an issue for electronic devices with fewer  resources, such as an Internet tablet or mobile phone.  2.1 HTML Overview  25  The purpose of XHTML was to provide a foundation for device-independent web access.  XHTML was developed by the W3C to be the reformulation of HTML as an application of  XML. XHTML combines the formatting strengths of HTML and the data structure and  extensibility strengths of XML. Since XHTML was designed using XML, let’s take a quick   look at XML.  XML  eXtensible Markup Language  is the W3C standard method for creating new  markup languages that will support the display of nontraditional content such as  mathematical notation, as well as support a variety of display devices. XML can fulfill  these diverse needs because it is an extensible language—that is, it is designed to  allow the definition of new tags or markup. The syntax of XML is very exacting so that  devices do not have to waste processing power guessing how the document should  display, but can instead display information efficiently. An XML document must be  well formed. A well-formed document is a document that adheres to the syntax rules  of the language.  HTML5  As this textbook was being written, the W3C’s HTML Working Group  HTML WG  was busy  creating a draft recommendation for HTML5, which is intended to be the successor to  HTML4 and will replace XHTML. HTML5 incorporates features of both HTML and XHTML,  adds new elements of its own, provides new features such as form edits and native  video, and is intended to be backward compatible.  It is possible to begin using HTML5 right away! The newest versions of popular brows-  ers, such as Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 4, Safari 5, Google Chrome, and Opera 10,  already support some of the new features of HTML5. When new versions of each  browser are released, you can expect increased support of HTML5. As you learn to  design web pages, you need not only to know what works today in current browsers,  but also to get ready to use new HTML5 coding techniques. To meet this challenging  goal, this book introduces both XHTML syntax and HTML5 syntax, presents instruction  for coding web pages in HTML5 with backward-compatible elements that work in cur-  rent browsers, and provides practice with the new features of HTML5 that will work only  in the latest versions of browsers. Since HTML5 is in draft status and may change after  this book is printed, consult http:  www.w3.org TR html-markup for the most current  list of HTML5 elements.  FAQ What software do I need?  No special software is needed to create a web page document; all you need is a text editor. The  Notepad text editor is included with Microsoft Windows. TextEdit is distributed with the Mac OS X  operating system.  See http:  support.apple.com kb TA20406 for configuration information.  An alternative to the operating system’s basic text editor is one of the many free or shareware editors  that are available, such as Notepad++ for Windows   http:  notepad-plus-plus.org download    and TextWrangler for Macs   http:  www.barebones.com products textwrangler download.html  .  Another commonly used alternative is a commercial web-authoring tool, such as Microsoft  Expression Web or Adobe Dreamweaver. Regardless of the software or program you use,  having a solid foundation in HTML will be useful.  26  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  You will need to test your web pages in the most popular browsers, which are listed as follows,  along with the URLs where you can download them for free:  ● Internet Explorer   http:  microsoft.com ie9     ● Mozilla Firefox   http:  www.mozilla.com en-US products download.html    ● Apple Safari   http:  www.apple.com safari download     ● Google Chrome   http:  www.google.com chrome    You will also find the Web Developer Extension for Firefox    https:  addons.mozilla.org en-us firefox addon web-developer   to be useful.  2.2 Document Type Definition  Because multiple versions and types of HTML and XHTML exist, the W3C recommends  identifying the type of markup language used in a web page document with a Document  Type Definition  DTD  . The DTD identifies the version of HTML contained in your docu-  ment. Browsers and HTML code validators can use the information in the DTD when  processing the web page. The DTD statement, commonly called a doctype statement, is  placed at the top of a web page document. XHTML is the current standard version of  HTML and is supported by popular browsers. HTML5 is the newest version and is cur-  rently in draft status. Most of the examples in this book use HTML5 syntax. Except where  specifically noted, the HTML5 syntax will display on commonly used browsers.  Example XHTML Web Page  In this example, we will use the XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD, which is the least strict  version of XHTML 1.0. The DTD for XHTML 1.0 Transitional is as follows:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd  The rest of your web page document will consist of HTML elements and text. After the  DTD, each web page begins with an opening   tag and ends with a closing    tag. These tags indicate that the text between them is HTML formatted for  display in a browser. Every single XHTML web page you create will include the DTD  statement, followed by the html, head, title, meta, and body elements. A basic XHTML  web page template  found in the student files at chapter2 templatex.html  is as follows:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd  <html xmlns="  http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml  " lang="en" xml:lang="en">   Page Title Goes Here      2.3  "  ">  "  ">                 ... body text and more XHTML tags go here ...  2.4 Example HTML5 Web Page   27  The XHTML tags are lowercase in the code sample. This format conforms to XML syntax.  Notice also that the DTD statement does not follow this syntax. The DTD statement  indicates the markup language being used and has mixed-case formatting. With the  exception of the specific page title, the first eight lines will usually be the same on every  XHTML web page that you create.  When using XHTML, the   tag also needs to describe the XML namespace   xmlns , which is the location of the documentation for the elements being used.  This additional information is added to the   tag in the form of an attribute ,  which modifies or further describes the function of an element. The xmlns attribute  points to the URL of the XHTML namespace used in the document, the standard  http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml . The optional lang and xml:lang attributes specify the spoken language of the document. For example, lang="en" xml:lang="en"  indicate the English language. Search engines and screen readers may access these  attributes.  Don’t worry if the concept of specifying a DTD and the xmlns URL seem a bit overwhelm-  ing at first—these lines are reused over and over again in every web page. Once you  create your web page template, you’ll have these statements ready and waiting for all of  your future pages.  2.4  Example HTML5 Web Page  is as follows:     Now that you’ve seen an example of a web page using XHTML, let’s focus on HTML5. The  syntax is streamlined and easier to use. We will follow the coding style to use lowercase  letters and place quotation marks around attribute values. The HTML5 doctype statement  Just as with XHTML, the doctype statement is the first line in the document. Next, the  web page begins with an opening   tag and ends with a closing   tag.  These tags indicate that the text between them is HTML formatted for display in a  browser. Every HTML5 web page contains the doctype statement, followed by the html,  head, title, meta, and body elements. A basic HTML5 web page template  found in the  student files at chapter2 template.html  is as follows:            Page Title Goes Here                  28  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  ... body text and more HTML5 tags go here ...  The next section discusses the purpose of the head, title, meta, and body elements.   2.5  Head, Title, Meta, and Body Elements  There are two sections on a web page: the head and the body. The head section , some-  times called the header section, contains information that describes the web page doc-  ument. The body section contains the actual tags, text, images, and other objects that  are displayed by the browser as a web page.  The Head Section  Elements that are located in the head section include the title of the web page, meta  tags that describe the document  such as the character encoding used and information  that may be accessed by search engines , and references to scripts and styles. Many of  these features do not show directly on the web page. The head element contains the  head section, which begins with the   tag and ends with the   tag. You  will always code at least two other elements in the head section: a title element and a  meta element.  The first element in the head section, the title element , configures the text that will appear  in the title bar of the browser window. The text between the   and   tags is called the title of the web page and is accessed when web pages are bookmarked and  printed. The title should be descriptive. If the web page is for a business or organization,  the title should include the name of the organization or business.  The meta element describes a characteristic of a web page, such as the character  encoding. Character encoding is the internal representation of letters, numbers, and  symbols in a file such as a web page or other file that is stored on a computer and may  be transmitted over the Internet. There are many different character-encoding sets.  However, it is common practice to use a character-encoding set that is widely supported,  such as utf-8, which is a form of Unicode. The meta tag is not used as a pair of opening  and closing tags. It is considered to be a stand-alone, or self-contained , tag  referred to  as a void element in HTML5 . The meta tag is coded differently in XHTML and HTML5. The  XHTML meta tag has more detailed attributes and is coded with an ending  > . The HTML5  meta tag is streamlined and includes only the charset attribute to indicate the character     encoding.  XHTML Meta Tag  HTML5 Meta Tag     The Body Section  The body section contains text and elements that display directly on the web page in  the browser viewport. The purpose of the body section is to configure the contents of  the web page. The body element contains the body section, which begins with the    tag and ends with the   tag. You will spend most of your time writing  code in the body of a web page. If you type text into the body section, it will appear  directly on the web page.  2.6 Your First Web Page   29  2.6 Your First Web Page  Hands-On Practice 2.1  VideoNote  Your First  Web Page  fi rst web page.  Create a Folder  Now that you’re familiar with basic elements used on every web page, it’s your turn to create your  You’ll find it helpful to create folders to organize your files as you develop the web pages in this  book and create your own websites. Use your operating system to create a new folder named  mychapter2 on your hard drive or a portable flash drive.  To create a new folder on a Mac:  1. Launch Finder, and select the location where you would like to create the new folder.  2. Choose File > New Folder to create an untitled folder.  3. To rename the folder, select the folder and click on the current name. Type a name for the  folder, and press the Return key.  To create a new folder with Windows:  1. Launch Windows Explorer  either press the Windows key or select Start > All Programs >  Accessories > Windows Explorer , and navigate to the location where you would like to cre-  ate the new folder, such as My Documents or your C: drive.  2. Select Organize > New Folder.  3. To rename the New Folder, right-click on it, select Rename from the context-sensitive menu,  type in the new name, and press the Enter key.  Your First Web Page  Now  you  are  ready  to  create  your  first  HTML5  web  page.  Launch  Notepad  or  another  text editor.  Type in the following code:            My First HTML5 Web Page            Hello World        Notice  that  the  first  lines  in  the  file  contain  the  doctype.  The  HTML  code  begins  with  an opening    tag and ends with a closing   tag. The purpose of these tags is to indicate that  the content between the tags makes up a web page. The head section is delimited by    and   tags and contains a pair of title tags with the words “My First HTML5 Web Page”  in between, along with a   tag to indicate the character encoding. The body section is  delimited by   and   tags.   30  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  The  words  “Hello  World”  are  typed  on  a  line  between  the  body  tags.  See  Figure  2.1  for  a screen-  shot of the code as it would appear in Notepad. You have just created the source code for a  web page document.  Figure 2.1 Your web page source code displayed in Notepad  FAQ Do I have to start each tag on its own line?  No, you are not required to start each tag on a separate line. A browser can display  a page even if all the tags follow each other on one line with no spaces. Humans,  however, find it easier to write and read web page code if line breaks and indentation  are used.  Save Your File  You will save your file with the name of index.html. A common file name for the home page of  a website is index.html or index.htm. Web pages use either a .htm or a .html file extension. The  web pages in this book use the .html file extension. Display your file in Notepad or another text  editor. Select File from the menu bar, and then select Save As. The Save As dialog box will  appear.  Navigate  to  your  mychapter2  folder.  Using  Figure  2.2  as  an  example,  type  the  file name.  Click the Save button after you type the file name. Sample solutions for the exercises are avail-  able in the student files. If you like, you can compare your work with the solution in the student  files at chapter2 index.html before you test your page.

In some older versions of Windows, Notepad will automatically append a .txt file exten-  sion. If this happens, type the name of the file within quotation marks  “index.html” , and  save your file again.  Test Your Page  There are two ways to test your page:  1. Launch Windows Explorer  Windows  or Finder  Mac . Navigate to your index.html fi le.  Double-click index.html. The default browser will launch and will display your index.html  page. Your page should look similar to the one shown in Figure 2.3 .  Figure 2.3 Web page displayed by Internet Explorer  2. Launch a browser.  If you are using Internet Explorer 9, right-click in the area at the top of the  browser window and select the Menu bar.  Select File > Open > Browse. Navigate to your  index.html fi le. Double-click index.html, and click OK. If you used Internet Explorer, your page  should look similar to the one shown in Figure 2.3 . A display of the page using Firefox 4 is  shown in Figure 2.4 .  Figure 2.4 Web page displayed by Firefox  Examine your page. Look carefully at the browser window. Notice how the browser title bar  or browser tab displays the title text, “My First HTML5 Web Page.” Some search engines use  the text enclosed within the   and   tags to help determine the relevancy of  keyword searches, so make certain that your pages contain descriptive titles. The title element  is also used when viewers bookmark your page or add it to their Favorites. An engaging and  descriptive page title may entice a visitor to revisit your page. If your web page is for a com-  pany or an organization, it’s a best practice to include the name of the company or organiza-  tion in the title.   32  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  Checkpoint 2.1  2.7  Heading Element  1. Describe the origin, purpose, and features of HTML.  2. Describe the software needed to create and test web pages.  3. Describe the purpose of the head and body sections of a web page.  Heading elements are organized into six levels: h1 through h6. The text contained within  a heading element is rendered as a “block” of text by the browser  referred to as block  display  and displays with empty space  sometimes called “white space”  above and  below. The size of the text is largest for      called the heading 1 tag  and smallest for     called the heading 6 tag . Depending on the font being used  more on font sizes in  Chapter 3  , the text contained within   ,   , and   tags may be displayed smaller than the default text size. All text contained within heading tags is displayed with  bold font weight. Figure 2.5 shows a web page document with six levels of headings.  FAQ Why doesn’t the heading tag go in the head section?  It’s common for students to try to code the heading tags in the head section of the document,  but someone doing this won’t be happy with the way the browser displays the web page. Even  though “heading tag” and “head section” sound similar, always code heading tags in the body  section of the web page document.  Figure 2.5 Sample  headings  Hands-On Practice 2.2   To create the web page shown in Figure 2.5 , launch Notepad or another text editor. Select File > Open  to edit the HTML5 template fi le located at chapter2 template.html in the student fi les. Modify the title  element and add heading tags to the body section as indicated by the following highlighted code:  2.8 Paragraph Element  33            Heading Example             Heading Level 1    Heading Level 2    Heading Level 3    Heading Level 4    Heading Level 5    Heading Level 6         Save the document as heading2.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser  such as Internet Explorer or Firefox to test your page. It should look similar to the page shown  in Figure 2.5 . You can compare your work with the HTML5 solution found in the student files   chapter2 heading.html  and the XHTML solution  chapter2 headingxhtml.html . Notice that in  this  example,  the  code  for  both  solutions  is  the  same  except  for  the  Document  Type Declaration,  html,  and  meta  tags.  This  is  true  for  most  of  the  examples  in  this  chapter.  The  HTML5 solutions  for each hands-on practice activity are provided in the student files. The XHTML solution is also  provided when deemed useful for comparison.  Accessibility and Headings  Heading tags can help to make your pages more accessible and usable. You create an  outline of the page content when you code heading tags numerically as appropriate   h1, h2, h3, and so on  and configure page content in block display elements such as  Focus on  Accessibility  paragraphs and lists. Visually challenged visitors who are using a screen reader can  direct the software to display a list of the headings used on a page to focus on the  topics that interest them. Your well-organized page will be more usable for every visitor  to your site, including those who are visually challenged.   More Heading Options in HTML5  You may have heard about the new HTML5 header hgroup elements. They offer additional  options for configuring headings, but they are supported only in newer browsers. We will  introduce these new elements in Chapter 6 .  2.8  Paragraph Element  Paragraph elements are used to group sentences and sections of text together. Text that  is contained by   and   tags display as a “block”  referred to as block display  and will appear with empty space above and below it. Figure 2.6 shows a web page document with a paragraph after the first heading.  To create the web page shown in Figure 2.6 , launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the fi le  located  at  chapter2 heading.html  in  the  student  fi  les.  Modify  the  page  title,  and  add  a paragraph  of text to your page below the line with the   tags and above the line with the   tags.

Launch a browser to  test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.6 . You can compare your  work  with  the  solution  found  in  the  student  files   chapter2 paragraph.html .  Notice  how  the text in  the paragraph wraps automatically as you resize your browser window.  2.9 Line Break Element  35  Alignment  As you tested your web pages, you may have noticed that the headings and text begin  near the left margin. This placement is called left alignment and is the default align-  ment for web pages. There are times, however, when you want a paragraph or heading  to be centered or right aligned. The align attribute can be used for this purpose. The  purpose of an attribute is to modify the properties of an HTML element. In this case,  the align attribute modifies the element’s horizontal alignment  left, center, or right  on  a web page. To center an element on a web page, use the attribute align="center" .  To right-align the text within an element, use the align="right" attribute. In XHTML  syntax, the align attribute can be used with a number of block display elements,  including the paragraph       and heading     through     tags. The align  attribute is obsolete in HTML5, which means that while it may be used in XHTML, the  attribute has been removed from the W3C HTML5 draft specification. In Chapter 6 , you  will learn how to configure alignment using a more modern approach with Cascading   Style Sheets  CSS .  2.9  Line Break Element  The line break element causes the browser to advance to the next line before displaying  the next element or portion of text on a web page. The line break tag is not coded as a  pair of opening and closing tags. It is considered to be a stand-alone, or void , element.  In HTML5 syntax, the line break tag is coded as   . In XHTML  which follows XML syn-  tax , the line break tag is coded as   .  The ending  > indicates a self-contained  tag.  Figure 2.7 shows a web page document with a line break after the first sentence in  the paragraph.  Figure 2.7 Notice the line break after the fi rst sentence  36  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  Hands-On Practice 2.4  To create the web page shown in Figure 2.7 , launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the  fi  le  located  at  chapter2 paragraph.html  in  the  student  fi  les.  Modify  the  text  contained between  the title tags to be “Line Break Example”.  Place  your  cursor  after  the  fi  rst  sentence  in  the para-  graph  after “This is a sample paragraph.” . Press the Enter key. Save your fi le. Test your page in a  browser,  and  notice  that  even  though  your  source  code  showed  the  “This  is  a  sample paragraph.”  sentence on its own line, the browser did not render it that way. A line break tag is needed to con-  fi gure the browser to display the second sentence on a new line. Edit the fi le in a text editor, and  add a   tag  the fi le uses HTML5 syntax  after the fi rst sentence in the paragraph, as shown   This is a sample paragraph.   Heading tags can help to make  your pages more accessible and usable. It is good coding practice to  use heading tags to outline the structure of your web page content.  in the following code snippet:      Heading Level 1       Heading Level 2    Heading Level 3    Heading Level 4    Heading Level 5     Heading Level 6      Save your file as linebreak2.html. Launch a browser to test your page. It should look similar to  the page shown in Figure 2.7 . You can compare your work with the solution found in the  student files  chapter2 linebreak.html . An XHTML solution can also be found in the student  files  chapter2 linebreakxhtml.html .  FAQ Why does my web page still look the same?  Often, students make changes to a web page document, but get frustrated because their  browser shows an older version of the page. The following troubleshooting tips are helpful  when you know you modified your web page, but the changes do not show up in the  1. Make sure you save your page after you make the changes.  2. Verify the location that you are saving your page to—a specific folder on the hard drive or  browser:  removable storage.  3. Verify the location that your browser is requesting the page from—a specific folder on the  hard drive or removable storage.  4. Be sure to click the Refresh or Reload button in your browser.  2.10 Blockquote Element  37  2.10  Blockquote Element  In addition to organizing text in paragraphs and headings,  sometimes you need to add a quotation to a web page. The  blockquote element is used to display a block of quoted text  in a special way—indented from both the left and right mar-  gins. A block of indented text begins with a     tag and ends with a   tag. Figure 2.8 shows a  web page document with a heading, a paragraph, and a  Figure 2.8 The text within the blockquote  blockquote.  element is indented  Hands-On Practice 2.5  To create the web page shown in Figure 2.8 , launch a text editor.

Add  a heading tag, a paragraph tag, and a blockquote tag to the body section as indicated by the  following highlighted code:            Blockquote Example            http:  www.w3.org WAI   at  :                The Power of the Web    According to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web,  The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone  regardless of disability is an essential aspect.  Save the document as blockquote2.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser to  test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.8 . You can compare your  work with the solution found in the student files  chapter2 blockquote.html .  You have probably noticed how convenient the   tag could be if you  need to indent an area of text on a web page. You may have wondered whether it  would be OK to use the blockquote element anytime you would like to indent text  38  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  or whether the blockquote element is reserved only for long quotations. The  semantically correct use of the blockquote element is only for displaying large  blocks of quoted text within a web page. Why should you be concerned about  semantics? Consider the future of the Semantic Web, described in Scientific  American   http:  www.scientificamerican.com article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web   as  “[a] new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers [that] will unleash a  revolution of new possibilities.” Using HTML in a semantic, structural manner is one  step toward the Semantic Web. So, avoid using a blockquote element just to indent  text. You will learn modern techniques to configure margins and padding on ele-  ments later in this book.  2.11  Phrase Elements  Phrase elements , sometimes referred to as logical style elements , indicate the context  and meaning of the text between the container tags. It is up to each browser to interpret  that style. Phrase elements are displayed right in line with the text  referred to as inline   display  and can apply to a section of text or even just a single character of text. For  example, the    element indicates that the text associated with it has strong  importance and should be displayed in a “strong” manner in relation to normal text on  the page. Table 2.1 lists common phrase elements and examples of their use. Notice  that some tags, such as   and   , result in the same type of display  italics   as the   tag in today’s browsers. These tags semantically describe the text as a  citation or definition, but the physical display is usually italics in both cases.  Table 2.1 Phrase elements  Element  Example  Usage     WIPO     bold text     cite text     code text     dfn text        kbd text     mark text     samp text     small text  emphasized text     italicized text  Identifies text as an abbreviation; configure the title attribute with the full name  Text that has no extra importance, but is styled in bold font by usage and convention  Identifies a citation or reference; usually displayed in italics  Identifies program code samples; usually a fixed-space font  Identifies a definition of a word or term; usually displayed in italics  Causes text to be emphasized in relation to other text; usually displayed in italics  Text that has no extra importance, but is styled in italics by usage and convention  Identifies user text to be typed; usually a fixed-space font  Text that is highlighted in order to be easily referenced  HTML5 only   Shows program sample output; usually a fixed-space font  Legal disclaimers and notices  “fine print”  displayed in small font size   Strong importance; causes text to stand out from surrounding text; usually displayed in bold     strong text     sub text     sup text     var text  Displays a subscript as small text below the baseline  Displays a superscript as small text above the baseline  Identifies and displays a variable or program output; usually displayed in italics  Each phrase element is a container element, so an opening and a closing tag must be  used. As shown in Table 2.1 , the   element indicates that the text associated  with it has “strong” importance. Usually, the browser  or other user agent  will display    text in bold font type. A screen reader, such as JAWS or Window-Eyes, might  2.12 Unordered List  39  interpret   text to indicate that the text should be more strongly spoken. In the  following line, the phone number is displayed with strong importance:  Call for a free quote for your web development needs:  888.555.5555  The corresponding code is   Call for a free quote for your web development needs:   888.555.5555    Notice that the opening   and closing   tags are contained within the  paragraph tags     and    . This code is properly nested and is considered to be  well formed . When improperly nested, the   and   tag pairs overlap each  other instead of being nested within each other. Improperly nested code will not pass  validation testing  see Section 2.18 , “HTML Validation”  and may cause display issues.

Figure 2.9 The    tag in action  2.12  Unordered List  Lists are used on web pages to organize information. When writing for the Web, head-  ings, short paragraphs, and lists make your pages clear and easy  to read. HTML can be used to create three types of lists: descrip-  tion lists , ordered lists , and unordered lists . This section focuses  on the unordered list, often referred to as a bulleted list when  using word processing applications.  An unordered list displays a bullet, or list marker, before each entry  in the list. This bullet can be one of several types: disc  the default ,  square, and circle. See Figure 2.10 for a sample unordered list.  Each list item begins with an   tag and ends with an   tag. The code to configure the heading and unordered list shown in Figure 2.10 is  Figure 2.10 Sample unordered list  Unordered lists begin with a  tag and end with a   tag.   Popular Web Servers    Apache Web Server    Microsoft IIS    Oracle iPlanet Web Server            40  Chapter 2 HTML Basics   The Type Attribute  The type attribute can be used to change the type of list marker, or bullet. For example, to  create an unordered list organized with square list markers, use   .  Table 2.2 documents the type attribute and its values for unordered lists.  Table 2.2 The type attribute for unordered lists  HTML5 and Unordered Lists  The type attribute is widely used in unordered lists and is valid in XHTML. However, be  aware that the type attribute on the   tag is considered obsolete in HTML5 because  it is decorative and does not convey meaning. No worries—you will learn how to config-  ure the list markers in an unordered list with CSS in Chapter 6 .

In Chapter 6 , you will learn to use Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  to configure the  list markers  “bullets”  in an unordered list to display graphic files as list markers.  2.13  Ordered List  An ordered list displays a numbering or lettering system to  itemize the information contained in the list. Ordered lists can  be organized by the use of numerals  the default , uppercase  letters, lowercase letters, uppercase Roman numerals, and  lowercase Roman numerals. See Figure 2.12 for a sample  ordered list.  Ordered lists begin with an   tag and end with an  Figure 2.12 Sample ordered list  Each list item begins with an   tag and ends with an     tag.

The code to configure the heading and ordered list shown in Figure 2.12 follows:  The type attribute configures the symbol used for ordering the list. For example, to  create an ordered list organized by uppercase letters, use   . Table 2.3  documents the type attribute and its values for ordered lists.

In HTML5, the type attribute is obsolete for use with unordered lists. However,  the type attribute is valid when used with ordered lists because the sequencing provides  information. The start attribute is useful when you need a list to begin with an integer  value other than 1  for example, start="10"  . Use the new HTML5 reversed attribute  set  reversed="reversed"   to configure the list markers to display in descending order.  Hands-On Practice 2.7  In this Hands-On Practice, you will use a heading and an ordered list on the same page. To create  the  web  page  shown  in  Figure  2.13  ,  launch  a  text  editor.  Select  File  >  Open  to  edit  the template  fi le located at chapter2 template.html in the student fi les.

A description list is useful for organ-  izing terms and their descriptions. The terms stand out, and their descriptions can be as  long as needed to convey your message. Each term begins on its own line at the margin.   Each description begins on its own line and is indented. Description lists are also handy  for organizing Frequently Asked Questions  FAQs  and their answers. The questions and  answers are offset with indentation. Any type of information that consists of a number of  corresponding terms and longer descriptions is well suited to being organized in a  description list. See Figure 2.14 for an example of a web page that uses a description list.  Figure 2.14 A  description list  Description lists begin with the    tag and end with the   tag. Each term or name  in the list begins with the    tag and ends with the   tag. Each description  begins with the   tag and ends with the   tag.  Hands-On Practice 2.8  In this Hands-On Practice, you will use a heading and a description list on the same page. To  create the web page shown in Figure 2.14 , launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the  template fi le located at chapter2 template.html in the student fi les. Modify the title element and  add h1, dl, dd, and dt tags to the body section as indicated by the following highlighted code:            Description List      Chapter 2 HTML Basics  44         Sample Description List       TCP    Transmission Control Protocol is a method  protocol  used  along with the Internet Protocol  IP  to send data in the form of  message units, called packets, between computers over the Internet.

Launch a browser and test your page. It should look similar  to the page shown in Figure 2.14 . Don’t worry if the word wrap is a little different; the impor-  tant formatting is that each   term should be on its own line and the corresponding    description should be indented under it. Try resizing your browser window, and notice how the  word wrap on the description text changes. You can compare your work with the solution in the  student files  chapter2 description.html .  FAQ Why is the HTML code in the Hands-On Practice examples indented?  Actually, it doesn’t matter to the browser if web page code is indented, but humans find it  easier to read and maintain code when it is logically indented. Review the description list cre-  ated in Hands-On Practice 2.7. Notice how the   and   tags were indented. This  makes it easier for you or another web developer to understand the source code in the future.  There is no rule as to how many spaces to indent, although your instructor or the organization  you  work  for  may  have  a  standard.  Consistent  indentation  helps  to  create  more  easily maintain-  able web pages.  Checkpoint 2.2  1. Describe the features of a heading element and how it configures the text.  2. Describe the difference between ordered lists and unordered lists.  3. Describe the purpose of the blockquote element.  2.15 Special Characters  45  2.15  Special Characters  In order to use special symbols such as quotation marks, the greater-than sign  > , the  less-than sign  < , and the copyright symbol     in your web page document, you need  to use special characters , sometimes called entity characters . For example, if you  wanted to include a copyright line on your page as follows:    Copyright 2013 My Company. All rights reserved.  Use the special character   to display the copyright symbol, as shown in the  following code:    Copyright 2013 My Company. All rights reserved.  Another useful special character is     , which stands for nonbreaking space. You  may have noticed that web browsers treat multiple spaces as a single space. If you need  a small number of spaces in your text, you may use   multiple times to indicate  multiple blank spaces. This practice is acceptable if you simply need to tweak the posi-  tion of an element a little. However, if you find that your web pages contain many    special characters in a row, you should use a different method, such as configuring the  padding or margin with Cascading Style Sheets  see Chapters 4 and 6 . . Table 2.4 and  Appendix C , “Special Entity Characters,” provide descriptions of special characters and  their corresponding code.  Table 2.4 Common special characters  Right single quotation mark  Character  Entity Name  Code  Quotation mark  “  "  ‘  ’        &  &     —  —      Copyright symbol  Ampersand  Empty space  Nonbreaking space  Long dash  Vertical Bar  Hands-On Practice 2.9  Figure  2.15  shows  the  web  page  you  will  create  in  this  Hands-On  Practice.  Launch  a  text editor.  Select File > Open to edit the template fi le located at chapter2 template.html in the student fi les.  Modify the title of the web page by changing the text between the   and   tags  to “Web Design Steps.”  The sample page shown in Figure 2.15 contains a heading, an unordered list, and copyright  information.  Configure  the  heading  “Web  Design  Steps”  as  a  level  1  heading           as follows:   Web Design Steps    46  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  Figure 2.15 The design.html web page  Now create the unordered list. The first line of each bulleted item is the title of the web design  step, which should be strong or stand out from the rest of the text. The code for the beginning  of the unordered list is as follows:       Determine the Intended Audience    The colors, images, fonts, and layout should be tailored to the   preferences of your audience.  The type of site content   reading level, amount of animation, etc.  should be appropriate for  your chosen audience.   Now code the entire ordered list in your design.html file. Remember to code the closing    tag  at  the  end  of  the  list.  Don’t  worry  if  your  text  wraps  a  little  differently;  your  screen resolution  or browser window size may be different from what is displayed in Figure 2.15 .  Finally, configure the copyright information with the small element. Use the special character    for the copyright symbol. The code for the copyright line is as follows:    Copyright   2011 Your name. All Rights Reserved.  How did you do? Compare your work to the sample in the student files  chapter2 design.html .      2.16  Div Element  The div element configures a structural block area, or “division,” on a web page, with  empty space above and below. A div element begins with a   tag and ends with a    tag. Use a div element when you need to format an area of a web page, such as  a logo, navigation, or footer area. The div element is also useful for configuring a section  that contains other block display elements, such as   ,   ,   , and   2.16 Div Element  47  even other   elements. You will use Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  later in this book  to style and configure the color, text typeface, and layout of div and other structural ele-  ments such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. Chapter 6 will introduce new HTML5  structural elements that you can use in modern browsers instead of div elements to con-  figure common page areas, including the header, nav, footer, aside, article, and section  elements.  Hands-On Practice 2.10  In this Hands-On Practice, you will practice using the div element as you edit the Trillium Media  Design home page, shown in Figure 2.16 . Launch a text editor, and open the starter.html fi le from  the chapter2 folder in the student fi les. Save your page as div2.html.

As you  continue to develop web pages, youwill find that div elements are very handy for configuring  FAQ Are there new structural elements in HTML5 that configure  areas on web pages.  areas on web pages?  Yes, one of the characteristics of HTML5 is an emphasis on semantics. While the div element  is useful, it is also quite generic. HTML5 offers a variety of special-purpose structural elements,  including section, article, heading, nav, aside, and footer. You’ll explore these elements in  Chapter 6 .  2.17  Anchor Element  and ends with a    Use the anchor element to specify a hyperlink , often referred to as a link , to another  web page or file that you want to display. Each anchor element begins with an   tag  tag. The opening and closing anchor tags surround the text to  click to perform the hyperlink. Use the href attribute to configure the hyperlink refer-  ence, which identifies the name and location of the file to access. Figure 2.17 shows a  web page document with an anchor tag that configures a hyperlink to this book’s web-  site, http:  webdevfoundations.net .   2.17 Anchor Element  49  Figure 2.17  Sample hyperlink  <a href="  http:  webdevfoundations.net  ">Web Development & Design  Foundations   The code for the anchor tag in Figure 2.17 is as follows:  Notice that the href value is the URL for the website. The text that is typed between the  two anchor tags displays on the web page as a hyperlink and is underlined by most  browsers. When you move the mouse cursor over a hyperlink, the cursor changes to a  pointing hand, as shown in Figure 2.17 .  Hands-On Practice 2.11  To create the web page shown in Figure 2.17 , launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the  template fi le located at chapter2 template.html in the student fi les. Modify the title element and  add anchor tags to the body section as indicated by the following highlighted code:            Anchor Example            <a href="        http:  webdevfoundations.net  ">Web Development & Design  Foundations   Save the document as anchor2.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser to test   your page. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.17 . You can compare your work  with the solution found in the student files  chapter2 anchor.html .  FAQ Can images be hyperlinks?  Yes. Although we’ll concentrate on text hyperlinks in this chapter, it’s also possible to configure  an image as a hyperlink. You’ll get practice with image links in Chapter 4 .  An absolute hyperlink indicates the absolute location of a resource on the Web.  Use absolute hyperlinks when you need to link to resources on other websites. The  href value for an absolute hyperlink to the home page of a website includes the  http:   protocol and the domain name. The following hyperlink is an absolute hyper-  link to the home page of this book’s website:  50  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  Absolute Hyperlinks  <a href="  http:  webdevfoundations.net  ">Web Development & Design  Foundations   Note that if we want to access a web page other than the home page on the book’s web-  site, we could also include a specific folder name and file name. For example, the fol-  lowing anchor tag configures an absolute hyperlink for a file named chapter1.html  located in a folder named 6e on this book’s website:  http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter1.html  <a href="  ">Web Development  & Design Foundations  Chapter  1      Relative Hyperlinks  When you need to link to web pages within your site, use a relative  hyperlink. The href value for a relative hyperlink does not begin with  the http:   and does not include a domain name. For a relative hyper-  link, the href value will contain only the file name or file name and  folder of the web page you want to display. The hyperlink location is  Figure 2.18 Site map  relative to the page currently being displayed. For example, if you were  coding a home page  index.html  for the website whose site map is illustrated in Figure  2.18 and wanted to link to a page named contact.html located in the same folder as index.  html, you would use the following code sample:   Contact Us   Hands-On Practice 2.12  The best way to learn how to code web pages is by actually doing it! Let’s practice and create  three pages in a sample website.  1. Create a new folder. Name your folder “mypractice”. The site we will create here is an ex-  ample of a personal website. It will contain a home page called index.html and two content  pages called background.html and favorites.html. A sample site map  see Figure 2.18   shows  Figure 2.19 Sample index.html  displayed in the Firefox browser  2.17 Anchor Element  51  the organization of the site: a home page  index.html  with navigation hyperlinks to two other  pages  background.html and favorites.html .  2. Now create the home page for your mypractice website, as shown in Figure 2.19 . Launch a  text editor. Select File > Open to edit the template fi le located at chapter2 template.html in  the student fi les. Modify the title element and confi gure the following:  ● A “My Website” heading—use   tags  ● An unordered list with the following:  ● An absolute link to your favorite search engine  ● An absolute link to the website of your school  ● A relative link to background.html   ● A relative link to favorites.html  The body section of your web page will be similar to the following code sample:      My Website       <a href="  http:  google.com  ">Google     <a href="  http:  harpercollege.edu  ">Harper College            My Background      My Favorites    Save your page as index.html in the mypractice folder. Display your page in a browser. It  should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.19 . Compare your work to the sample   chapter2 practice index.html  in the student fi les. Test your page by clicking each link. When  you click the absolute links to your favorite search engine and your school, you should see  those pages displayed if you are connected to the Internet. The relative links should not work  yet; let’s create the background.html page in Step 3.  3. Create the background.html page, as shown in Figure 2.20 .  Figure 2.20 Sample background.html page  52  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  Let’s work effi ciently by building on the previous page. Launch a text editor and open the  index.html fi le. Select File > Save As to save the fi le with the name background.html in the  mypractice folder. In order to create a consistent logo for the site, do not change the h1  heading area. Replace the rest of the web page content with the following:  ● A subheading of “My Background”—use   tags  ● A paragraph that contains one or two sentences about your background  ● A navigation bar confi gured within a div that contains relative hyperlinks to the home page   index.html , the “My Background” page  background.html , and the “My Favorites” page   favorites.html . As shown in Figure 2.20 , you will need to add a blank space between each an-  chor element. The body section of your web page will be similar to the following code sample:      My Website    My Background    As a college student majoring in Web Design, I’m interested  in developing my skills in design principles, HTML, and CSS.     Home     Background    Favorites       Save your fi le. Now test your index.html page again. This time, when you click the “My  Background” hyperlink, your browser should display your new page. Click the “Home”  hyperlink on your background.html page to redisplay your home page. Don’t worry if these  hyperlinks do not work perfectly the fi rst time. If you have problems, carefully examine  the source code of the pages, and verify the existence and location of the fi les by using  Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder.  4. Using Step 3 as a guide, create the “My Favorites” page  favorites.html , and confi gure an  unordered list of your favorite topics. See an example in the student fi les  chapter2 practice   favorites.html .  FAQ What if my relative hyperlink doesn’t work?  Check the following:  ● Did you save files in the specified folder?  ● Did you save the files with the names as requested? Use Windows Explorer, My  Computer, or Finder  Mac users  to verify the actual names of the files you saved.  ● Did you type the file names correctly in the anchor tag’s href property? Check for typo-  graphical errors.  ● When you place your mouse cursor over a link, the file name of a relative link will display in the  status bar in the lower edge of the browser window. Verify that the correct file name appears.  On many operating systems, such as UNIX or Linux, the use of uppercase and lowercase in file  names matters, so make sure that the file name and the reference to it are in the same case.  It’s a good practice to use only lowercase letters for file names used on the Web.  2.17 Anchor Element  53  E-Mail Hyperlinks   The anchor tag can also be used to create e-mail hyperlinks. An e-mail link will automat-  ically launch the default mail program configured for the browser. The href value of an  e-mail link begins with “mailto:”, followed by a valid e-mail address. For example, to  create an e-mail link to the e-mail address help@terrymorris.net, code the following:   help@terrymorris.net   It’s a good practice to configure the e-mail address as the hyperlink text. Not everyone  has an e-mail program configured with his or her browser. You increase usability for all  your visitors by displaying the e-mail address as text on the web page.  Hands-On Practice 2.13  In this Hands-On Practice, you will modify the home page of the website you created in Hands-  On Practice 2.12 by adding an e-mail link to the page’s footer area. Launch a text editor, and  open the index.html fi le from your mypractice folder. This example uses the index.html fi le found in  the student fi les in the chapter2 practice folder.  Figure 2.21 E-mail link added to  index.html  Configure a div that contains the text “Contact:” and an e-mail hyperlink at the bottom of the  page as shown in Figure 2.21 . Use your e-mail address as the href value. Save the page, and  test it in a browser. The browser display should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.21 .  Compare your work with the sample in the student files  chapter2 practice2 index.html . Modify  the favorites.html and background.html files in a similar manner.

While it’s possible that some unethical spammers may harvest web pages for  e-mail addresses, chances are that your e-mail application’s built-in spam filter will prevent  your inbox from being flooded with messages. When you configure an easily readable  54  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  situations:  e-mail hyperlink, you increase the usability of your website for your visitors in the following  ● The visitor may be at a public computer with no e-mail application configured. In such a  case, clicking the e-mail hyperlink usually causes an error message to display. The visitor  will have difficulty contacting you in this manner.  ● The visitor may be at a private computer, but prefer not to use the e-mail application  or  address  that is configured by default to work with the browser. Perhaps he or she shares  the computer with others, or perhaps he or she wishes to preserve the privacy of the  default e-mail address.   If you prominently displayed your actual e-mail address, then a visitor in either of these  situations can still access your e-mail address and use it to contact you  in either their e-mail  application or via a web-based e-mail system such as Google’s Gmail . The result is a more  usable website for your visitors.  Accessibility and Hyperlinks  Visually challenged visitors who are using a screen reader can configure the software to  display a list of the hyperlinks in the document. However, a list of links is useful only if  the text describing each link is actually helpful and descriptive. For example, on your  Focus on  Accessibility  that simply says, “More information.”  Block Anchor  college website, a “Search the course schedule” link would be more useful than a link  It’s typical to use anchor tags to configure phrases, or even just a single word, as a  hyperlink. HTML5 provides a new function for the anchor tag: the block anchor. A block  anchor can configure one or more elements  even those which display as a block,  such as a div, h1, or paragraph  as a hyperlink. See an example in the student files  at chapter2 block.html.  FAQ What are some tips for using hyperlinks?  ● Make your link names descriptive and brief to minimize possible confusion.  ● Avoid using the phrase “Click here” in your hyperlinks. In the early days of the Web,  this phrase was needed because clicking links was a new experience for web users.  Now that the Web is a daily part of our lives, this phrase is slightly redundant, and  even archaic.  ● Try not to bury hyperlinks within large blocks of text; use lists of hyperlinks instead. Be  aware that it is more difficult to read web pages than printed pages.  ● Be careful when linking to external websites. The Web is dynamic, and it’s possible that  the external site may change the name of the page, or even delete the page. If this hap-  pens, your link will be broken.   2.18 HTML Validation  55  Checkpoint 2.3  2.18  HTML Validation  1. Describe the purpose of special characters.  2. Describe when to use an absolute link. Is the http protocol used in the href value?  3. Describe when to use a relative link. Is the http protocol used in the href value?  The W3C’s free Markup Validation Service, available at http:  validator.w3.org , will validate your HTML code and check it for syntax errors. HTML validation provides  students with quick self-assessment—you can prove that your code uses correct  syntax. In the working world, HTML validation serves as a quality assurance tool.  Invalid code may cause browsers to render the pages slower than otherwise.  Hands-On Practice 2.14  In this Hands-On Practice, you will use the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate a web page  fi le. This example uses the page completed in Hands-On Practice 2.8  located in the student fi les at  VideoNote  HTML Validation  chapter2 design.html . Open design.html in a text editor. Add an error to the design.html page by  deleting  the  fi  rst  closing     tag.  This  modifi  cation  should  generate  several  error messages.  Next, attempt to validate the design.html file. To do so, launch a browser, and visit the W3C  Markup Validation Service file upload page at http:  validator.w3.org validate_by_upload . Click  the  Browse  button,  and  select  the  chapter2 design.html  file  from  your  computer.  Click  the Check  button to upload the file to the W3C site   Figure 2.22  .  An error page will display. Notice the “Errors found while checking this document” message. You  can view the errors by scrolling down the page, as shown in Figure 2.23 .  Figure 2.22 Validating a page with the W3C Markup Validation Service   56  Chapter 2 HTML Basics  Figure 2.23 The service indicates that the error is on line 12  Notice that the message indicates line 12, which is the first line after the missing closing    tag. HTML error messages often point to a line that follows the error. The text of the  message,  “End  tag  for  li  seen,  but  there  were  unclosed  elements,”  lets  you  know  that something  is wrong. It is up to you to figure out what it is. A good place to start is to check your container  tags and make sure they are in pairs. In this case, that is the problem. You can scroll down to  view the other errors. However, since multiple error messages are often displayed after a single  error occurs, it is a good idea to fix one item at a time and then revalidate.  Edit the design.html file in a text editor, and add the missing   tag. Save the file.  Launch a browser, and visit http:  validator.w3.org validate_by_upload . Select your file, select  More Options, and verify that the Show Source and Verbose Output check boxes are checked.  Click the Revalidate button to begin the validation.  Figure 2.24 The page has passed the validation test   2.18 HTML Validation  57  Your display should be similar to that shown in Figure 2.24 . Notice the “This document was  successfully checked as HTML5!” message. This means that your page passed the validation  test. Congratulations, your design.html page is valid! You may also notice a warning mes-  sage, which you can overlook, indicating that the HTML5 conformance checker is in experi-  mental status.  It is good practice to validate your web pages. However, when validating code, use common  sense. Since web browsers still do not completely follow W3C recommendations, there will be  situations, such as when adding multimedia to a web page, in which HTML code configured to  work reliably across a variety of browsers and platforms will not pass validation.  FAQ Are there other ways to validate my HTML?  In addition to the W3C validation service, there are other tools that you can use to check the  syntax of your code. Explore the HTML5 validator at http:  html5.validator.nu and the HTML5  “lint” tool at http:  lint.brihten.com html .  Chapter Summary  This chapter has provided an introduction to HTML, XHTML, and HTML5. The basic elements that are part of  every web page were demonstrated. Structural HTML elements including div, paragraph, and blockquote were  presented. Additional  topics  included  confi  guring  lists  and  using  special  characters,  phrase elements, and hy-  perlinks. You have practiced testing your HTML5 code for valid syntax. If you worked along with the samples  in the chapter, you should be ready to create some web pages on your own. The Hands-On Exercises and  Web Case Studies that follow will provide some additional practice.

Prime Properties  Prime Properties is a small real estate company that specializes in residential properties.  The owner, Maria Valdez, would like a website to showcase her listings and provide a  point of contact for her clients, who are mainly middle-class working adults who are  looking for a home in the northwest Chicago suburbs. Maria would like a home page, a  listings page that contains information about her properties, a fi nancing page, and a  contact page.  A site map for the Prime Properties website is shown in Figure 2.37 . The site map  describes the architecture of the website, which consists of “Home” page with three  main content pages: “Listings,” “Financing,” and “Contact.”   Figure 2.38 displays a wireframe sketch of the page layout for the website.

Web designers use CSS to separate the presen-  tation style of a web page from the information on the web page. CSS is used  to configure text, color, and page layout. CSS is not new—it was first proposed  as a standard by the W3C in 1996. In 1998, additional properties for positioning  web page elements were introduced to the language with CSS level 2  CSS2 ,  which was used for over a decade before reaching official “recommendation”  status in 2011. CSS continues to evolve, with proposals for CSS level 3  CSS3   properties that support features such as embedding fonts, rounded corners,  and transparency. This chapter introduces you to the use of CSS on the Web as  you explore how to configure color and text.  77   78  3.1  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  Overview of Cascading Style Sheets  For years, style sheets have been used in desktop  publishing to apply typographical styles and spac-  ing instructions to printed media. CSS provides this  functionality  and much more  for web developers.  CSS allows web developers to apply typographic  styles  typeface, font size, and so on  and page lay-  out instructions to a web page. The CSS Zen  Garden, http:  www.csszengarden.com , exemplifies  the power and flexibility of CSS   Figure 3.1  . Visit  this site for an example of CSS in action. Notice  how the content looks dramatically different  depending on the design  CSS style rules  you  select. Although the designs on the CSS Zen  Garden are created by CSS masters, at some point  Figure 3.1 The CSS Zen Garden home page at  http:  www.csszengarden.com  these designers were just like you—starting out  with CSS basics.  CSS is a flexible, cross-platform, standards-based language developed by  the W3C. The W3C’s description of CSS can be found at http:  www.w3.org Style .   Be aware that even though CSS has been in use for many years, it is still considered  an emerging technology, and different browsers do not support it in exactly the  same way. We concentrate on aspects of CSS that are well supported by popular  browsers.  Advantages of Cascading Style Sheets  There are several advantages to using CSS  see Figure 3.2  :  ● Typography and page layout can be better controlled. These features  include font size, line spacing, letter spacing, indents, margins, and  element positioning.  ● Style is separate from structure. The format of the text and colors used on the  page can be configured and stored separately from the body section of the web  page document.  ●  Styles can be stored. You can  store styles in a separate docu-  ment and associate them with  the web page. When the styles  are modified, the HTML remains  intact. This means, for example,  that if your client decides to  change the background color of  a set of web pages from red to  white, you only need to change  one file that contains the styles,  instead of modifying each web  Figure 3.2 The power of a single CSS fi le  page document.  3.1 Overview of Cascading Style Sheets  79  ● Documents are potentially smaller. The formatting is separate from the document;  therefore, the actual documents should be smaller.  ● Site maintenance is easier. Again, if the styles need to be changed,  then it is possible to complete the modifications by changing the style  sheet only.  You may be wondering if there are any disadvantages to using CSS. In fact, there  is one large disadvantage: CSS technology is not yet uniformly supported by  browsers. This disadvantage will be less of an issue in the future as browsers comply  with standards. Modern browsers have good support for CSS2 properties. Browser  support for new CSS3 features such as rounded corners and color transparency is  increasing, although there are differences in syntax, and not all browsers offer  the same level of support. See http:  caniuse.com cats=CSS for a list of CSS3  features supported by various browsers. This book will focus on aspects of CSS  that are well supported by modern browsers and note when differences in syntax  are needed.  Configuring Cascading Style Sheets   Web developers use four methods to incorporate CSS technology: inline, embedded,  external, and imported.  ● Inline styles are coded in the body of the web page as an attribute of an  HTML tag. The style applies only to the specific element that contains it as an  attribute.  ● Embedded styles are defined in the header of a web page. These style instructions  apply to the entire web page document.  ● External styles are coded in a separate text file. This text file is associated with  the web page by using a link element in the head section.  ● Imported styles are similar to external styles in that they can connect styles  coded in a separate text file with a web page document. An external style sheet  can be imported into embedded styles or into another external style sheet by  using the @import directive.  CSS Selectors and Declarations  Style sheets are composed of style rules that describe the styling to be applied. Each  rule has two parts: a selector and a declaration :  ● CSS Style Rule Selector The selector can be an HTML element name, a class  name, or an id name. In this section, we will focus on applying styles to element  name selectors. We will work with class selectors and id selectors later in this  chapter.  ● CSS Style Rule Declaration The declaration indicates the CSS property you are  setting  such as color  and the value you are assigning to the property.  For example, the CSS rule shown in Figure 3.3 would set the color of the text used on a  web page to blue. The selector is the body tag, and the declaration sets the color prop-  erty to the value of blue.  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  80  Figure 3.3 Using   The CSS background-color property configures the background color of an  element. The following style rule will configure the background color of a web page  to be yellow. Notice how the declaration is enclosed within braces and how the colon  symbol  :  separates the declaration property and the declaration value.

The  following CSS style rule will configure the text color of a web page to be blue:  body { color: blue }  Configure Background and Text Color  Figure 3.4 displays a web page with a blue text and a yellow background. To configure  more than one property for a selector, use a semicolon  ;  to separate the declarations  The spaces in these declarations are optional. The ending semicolon  ;  is also optional,  but useful in case you need to add additional style rules at a later time. The following  body { color: blue; background-color: yellow; }  as follows:  Figure 3.4 A web  page with yellow  background color  and blue text color  code samples are also valid:  3.1 Overview of Cascading Style Sheets  body {color:blue;background-color:yellow}  81  }  body { color: blue;  background-color: yellow; }  body {  color: blue;  background-color: yellow;  used on web pages.

See the CSS Property Reference in Appendix D for a detailed list of CSS properties.

RGB intensity values are numerical from 0 to  255. Each RGB color has three values, one each for red, green, and blue. These values   are always listed in the same order  red, green, blue  and specify the numerical value  of each color used  see the examples in Figure 3.5  . You will usually use hexadecimal  color values to specify RGB color on web pages.  Hexadecimal Color Values  Hexadecimal is the name for the base-16 numbering system, which uses the characters  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F to specify numeric values.  Hexadecimal color values specify RGB color with numeric value pairs ranging from  00 to FF  0 to 255 in base 10 . Each pair is associated with the amount of red, green,  and blue displayed. Using this notation, one would specify the color red as FF0000  and the color blue as 0000FF. The  symbol signifies that the value is hexadecimal.  You can use either uppercase or lowercase letters in hexadecimal color values;  FF0000 and ff0000 both configure the color red.  Don’t worry—you won’t need to do calculations to work with web colors. Just become  familiar with the numbering scheme. See Figure 3.6 for an excerpt from the color chart  at http:  webdevfoundations.net color .  Figure 3.5 Color  swatches and  hexadecimal color  values  Figure 3.6 Partial  color chart  Web-Safe Colors  Back in the day of 8-bit color monitors, web page color could be problematic  and it was important to use one of the 216 web-safe colors , which display in a  similar manner on both the Mac and PC platforms. The hexadecimal color  values of web-safe colors use the numerals 00, 33, 66, 99, CC, and FF. The  216 web-safe colors make up the Web-Safe Color Palette , shown in Appendix F   also at http:  webdevfoundations.net color  . Now that most monitors display millions of colors, using web-safe colors is less important. The Web-Safe Color Palette is rather  limited, and it is common for today’s web designers to choose colors creatively rather  than select them only from the palette.  3.3 Inline CSS with the Style Attribute  83  CSS Color Syntax  CSS syntax allows you to configure colors in a number of ways, including hexadecimal  color values, color names, and decimal color values. Table 3.2 shows CSS syntax  examples that configure a paragraph with red text.  Table 3.2 CSS color syntax examples  CSS Syntax  Color Type  p { color: red; }  Color name   p { color: FF0000; }  Hexadecimal color value  p { color: F00; }  Shorthand hexadecimal  one character for each  hexadecimal pair; used only with web-safe colors   p { color: rgb 255,0,0 ; }  Decimal color value  RGB triplet   FAQ Are there other methods to configure color with CSS?  Yes, the CSS3 Color Module  currently in proposed recommendation status  provides a way for  web developers to configure not only color, but also the transparency of the color, with RGBA   Red, Green, Blue, Alpha . You’ll explore this technique in Chapter 4 .  3.3  Inline CSS with the Style Attribute  Recall that there are four methods for configuring CSS: inline, embedded, external, and  imported. In this section, we focus on inline CSS using the style attribute.  The Style Attribute  Inline styles are coded as an attribute on an HTML tag using the style attribute . The  value of the style attribute is set to the style rule declaration that you need to configure.  Recall that a declaration consists of a property and a value. Each property is separated  from its value with a colon  : . The following code will use inline styles to set the text  color of an   tag to a shade of red:   This is displayed as a red heading   If there is more than one property, they are separated by a semicolon  ; . The  following code configures the heading with a red text color and a gray background  color:     This is displayed as a red heading on a gray background   Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  84  Hands-On Practice 3.1  specify the following:  In this Hands-On Practice, you will confi gure a web page with inline styles. The inline styles will  ● Global body tag styles for an off-white background with teal text. These styles will be  inherited by other elements by default. For example:      ● Styles for an h1 element with a teal background with off-white text. This style will override  the global styles confi gured on the body element. For example:     Figure 3.7 Web page using  inline styles  A sample is shown in Figure 3.7 . Launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the template file  located  at  chapter2 template.html  in  the  student  files.  Modify  the  title  element,  and  add heading  tags,  paragraph  tags,  style  attributes,  and  text  to  the  body  section  as  indicated  by  the following  highlighted code:            Inline CSS Example             Inline CSS    This paragraph inherits the styles applied to the body tag.         Save the document as inline2.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser  to test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 3.7 . Note that  the inline styles applied to the body tag are inherited by other elements on the page   such as the paragraph  unless more-specific styles are specified  such as those coded  on the   tag . You can compare your work with the solution found in the student files   chapter3 inline.html .  Let’s continue and add another paragraph, with the text color configured to be dark gray:   This paragraph overrides the text color  style applied to the body tag.    3.4 Embedded CSS with the Style Element  85  Figure 3.8 The second paragraph’s  inline styles override the global styles  confi gured on the body tag  Save the document as inline3.html. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 3.8 . You  can compare your work with the solution found in the student files  chapter3 inlinep.html . Note  that the inline styles applied to the second paragraph override the global styles applied to the  body of the web page.  FAQ Are inline styles recommended?  While inline styles can sometimes be useful, you’ll find that you won’t use this technique much  in practice—it’s inefficient, adds extra code to the web page document, and is inconvenient to  maintain. However, inline styles can be quite handy in some circumstances, such as when you  post  an  article  to  a  content  management  system  or  blog  and  need  to  tweak  the  sitewide styles  a bit to help get your point across.  3.4  Embedded CSS with the Style Element  In the previous Hands-On Practice, you added inline styles for one of the paragraphs. To  do so, you coded a style attribute on the paragraph element. But what if you needed to  configure the styles for 10 or 20 paragraphs instead of just one? Using inline styles, you  might be doing a lot of repetitive coding! While inline styles apply to one HTML element,  embedded styles apply to an entire web page.  Style Element  Embedded styles are placed within a   element located in the  head section of a web page. The opening   tag and the closing    tag contain the list of embedded-style rules. When using  XHTML syntax, the   tag requires a type attribute with the value  of "text css" to indicate the MIME type. HTML5 syntax does not require  The web page in Figure 3.9 uses embedded styles to set the text color  and background color of the web page document with the body element  the type attribute.  Figure 3.9 Web page with  embedded styles   86  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  selector. See the example in the student files at chapter3 embed.html. The  code follows:            Embedded Styles      body { background-color: CCFFFF;  color: 000033;     }                  Embedded CSS    This page uses embedded styles.   Notice the way the style rules were coded, with each rule on its own line. This  formatting is not required for the styles to work, but it makes the styles more readable  and easier to maintain than one long row of text. The styles are in effect for the entire  web page document because they were applied to the   tag using the body  Launch a text editor, and open the starter.html fi le from the chapter3 folder in the student fi les.

Notice that the web page code uses  the   ,   ,   ,   ,   , and   elements. In this Hands-On Practice, you will code embedded styles to configure selected background and text colors. You will use the body  element selector to configure the default background color  e6e6fa  and default text color   191970  for the entire page. You will also use the h1 and h2 element selectors to configure  different background and text colors for the heading areas. Edit the embedded.html file in a  text editor, and add the following code below the   element in the head section of the  web page:        body { background-color: e6e6fa; color: 191970; }  h1 { background-color: 191970; color: e6e6fa; }  h2 { background-color: aeaed4; color: 191970; }  Save your file, and test it in a browser. Figure 3.11 displays the web page along with  corresponding color swatches. A monochromatic color scheme was chosen. Notice how  the repetition of a limited number of colors unifies the design of the web page. View the  source code for your page, and review the CSS and HTML code. An example of this  web page is in the student files at chapter3 embedded.html. Note that all the styles were  located in a single place on the web page. Since embedded styles are coded in a specific  location, they are easier to maintain over time than inline styles. Also, notice that you coded  the styles for the h2 element selector only once  in the head section , and both of the    elements applied the h2 style. This approach is more efficient than coding the same  inline style on each   element. However, it is uncommon for a website to have only  one page. Repeating the CSS in the head section of each web page file is inefficient and  difficult to maintain. In the next section, you’ll use a more productive approach—configuring  an external style sheet.  Figure 3.11 The web page after embedded styles are  confi gured   88  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  FAQ My CSS doesn’t work; what can I do?  Coding CSS is a detail-oriented process. There are several common errors that can cause the  browser not to apply CSS correctly to a web page. With a careful review of your code and the  following tips, you should get your CSS working:  ● Verify that you are using the colon  :  and semicolon  ;  symbols in the right spots—they  are easy to confuse. The colon should separate the properties from their values, while the  semicolon should be placed between each property:value configuration.  ● Check that you are not using equal  =  signs instead of colons  :  between each property and  ● Verify that curly braces  { and }  are properly placed around the style rules for each selector.  ● Check the syntax of your selectors, the selectors’ properties, and the property values for  ● If part of your CSS works and part doesn’t, read through the CSS and determine the first rule  that is not applied. Often, the error is in the rule above the rule that is not applied.  ● Use a validation application to check your CSS code. The W3C has a free CSS code validator  at http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator . The W3C’s CSS validator can help you find syntax  errors. See Section 3.9 for an overview of how to use this tool to validate your CSS.  List three reasons to use CSS on a web page.  When designing a page that uses colors other than the default colors for text and background,  explain why it is a good reason to configure both the text color and the background color.  Describe one advantage to using embedded styles instead of inline styles.  Configuring Text with CSS  In Chapter 2 , you discovered how to use HTML to configure some characteristics of text  on web pages, including phrase elements such as the   element. You have also  already configured text color using the CSS color property. In this section, you will learn  to use CSS to configure font typeface. Using CSS to configure text is more flexible   especially when using an external style sheet, as you will discover later in the chapter   than using HTML elements and is the method preferred by modern web developers.

Create a built-in backup plan by listing multiple fonts and categories for the value  of the font-family property. The browser will attempt to use the fonts in the order listed.  The following CSS configures the p element selector to display text in Arial  if installed ,   Helvetica  if installed , or the default installed sans-serif font:  p { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }  FAQ I’ve heard about “embedding” fonts in order to use special fonts on  a web page—what’s that all about?  Still in draft form and not yet an official standard, CSS3 introduces @font-face , which can be  used to “embed” fonts within web pages, although what actually happens is that you provide  the location of the font and the browser downloads it. For example, if you own the rights to  freely distribute the font named MyAwesomeFont and it is stored in a file named myawesome-  font.otf in the same folder as your web page, the CSS to make it available to your web page  visitors is  @font-face { font-family: 'MyAwesomeFont';  src: url 'myawesomefont.otf' ; }  Current browsers support @font-face , but there are file size and copyright issues to  consider. You may have purchased a font, but you need to check your license to determine  whether you also have the right to freely distribute the font. For more information about  @font-face ,  see  http:  nimbupani.com font-in-your-face.html and  the  textbook’s  website  at http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter3.html . Keep in mind that if you need a nonstandard font just for a logo area or for an image on a web page, there is an easy  solution: You are free to use any font that is available to you when you create an image with  a graphics application.  90  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  More CSS Font Properties  CSS provides you with lots of options for configuring the text on your web pages. In this  section, you will explore the font-size , font-weight , font-style , and line-height  properties.  The font-size Property  The font-size property sets the size of the font. Table 3.4 lists a wide variety of text  and numeric values—there are almost too many choices available. See the notes in  Table 3.4 for recommended use.  Table 3.4 Configuring font size  Value Category  Values  Notes  Text Value  xx-small, x-small, small,  Scales well when text is resized in browser;  medium  default , large,  limited options for text size  x-large, xx-large  Pixel Unit  px   Numeric value with unit,  Pixel-perfect display depends on screen  such as 10 px  resolution; may not scale in every browser  when text is resized   Point Unit  pt   Numeric value with unit,  Use to configure print version of web page  such as 10 pt   see Chapter 7  ; may not scale in every  browser when text is resized  Em Unit  em   Numeric value with unit,  Recommended by W3C; scales well when  such as .75 em  text is resized in browser; many options for  text size  Percentage Value  Numeric value with per-  Recommended by W3C; scales well when  centage, such as 75%  text is resized in browser; many options for  text size  The em unit is a relative font unit that has its roots in the print industry, dating back to  the day when printers set type manually with blocks of characters. An em unit is the  width of a square block of type  typically the uppercase M  for a particular font and type  size. On web pages, an em unit corresponds to the width of the font and size used in  the parent element  typically the body element . So, the size of an em unit is relative to  the font typeface and default size. Percentage values work in a similar manner to em  units. For example, font-size: 100% and font-size: 1em should render the same  in a browser. To compare font sizes on your computer, launch a browser and view  chapter3 fonts.html in the student files.  The font-weight Property  The  The  font-weight property configures the boldness of the text. Configuring the CSS rule  font-weight: bold; has a similar effect as the   or   HTML element.  The font-style Property  font-style property typically is used to configure text displayed in italics. Valid  values for font-style are normal  the default , italic, and oblique. The CSS font-style:  italic; has the same visual effect in the browser as an   or   HTML element.  3.5 Configuring Text with CSS  91  The line-height Property  The line-height property modifies the default height of a line of text and is often  configured with a percentage value. For example, code line-height: 200%; to configure   text to appear double spaced.  The text-align Property  text-align  HTML elements are left-aligned by default; They begin at the left margin. The CSS  property configures the alignment of text and inline elements within block  display elements such as headings, paragraphs, and divs. The values for the text-align  property are left  default , right, and center. The following CSS code sample configures  an h1 element to have centered text:  h1 { text-align: center; }  While it can be quite effective to center the text displayed in web page headings,  be careful about centering text in paragraphs. According to WebAIM    http:  www.webaim.org techniques textlayout  , studies have shown that centered  text is more difficult to read than left-aligned text.  The text-indent Property  The CSS  text-indent  property configures the indentation of the first line of text within  an element. The value can be numeric  such as a px, pt, or em unit  or a percentage. The  following CSS code sample configures the first line of all paragraphs to be indented:  p { text-indent: 5em; }  The text-decoration Property  The purpose of the CSS text-decoration property is to modify the display of text.  Commonly used values for the text-decoration property include none , underline ,  overline , and line - through . Did you ever wonder why some hyperlinks are not under-  lined? Although hyperlinks are underlined by default, you can remove the underline with the  text-decoration property. The following code sample removes the underline on a hyperlink:  a { text-decoration: none; }  Hands-On Practice 3.3  Now that you’ve got a collection of new CSS properties for font and text confi guration, let’s try  them  out  by  modifying  the  embedded.html  page.  Launch  a  text  editor,  and  open embedded.html.  You will now code additional CSS style rules to confi gure the text on the page.  Set Default Font Properties for the Page  As you have already seen, CSS rules applied to the body selector apply to the entire page.  Modify the CSS for the body selector to display text using a sans-serif font. The new font  typeface style rule shown in the following code will apply to the entire web page unless more   92  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  specific style rules are applied to a selector  such as h1 or p , a class, or an id  more on  Save your page as embedded1.html, and test it in a browser. Your page should look similar to  the one shown in Figure 3.12 . Notice that just a single line of CSS changed the font typeface of  classes and ids later :  body { background-color: E6E6FA;  color: 191970;  font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; }  all the text on the page!  Figure 3.12 CSS  confi gures the  font on the web  page  Configure the h1 Selector  Now you will configure the line-height and font-family CSS properties. Set the  line-height property to 200%; this will add a bit of empty space above and below the heading  text.  In Chapters 4 and 6 , you will explore other CSS properties, such as the margin, border, and  padding,  that  are  more  commonly  used  to  configure  space  surrounding  an  element.   Next, modify  the  h1  selector  to  use  a  serif  font.  When  a  font  name  contains  spaces,  type  quotes  as indicated in  the code that follows. While it is generally recognized that blocks of text using sans-serif fonts are  easier to read, it is common to use a serif font to configure page or section headings.  h1 { background-color: 191970;  color: E6E6FA;  line-height: 200%;  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif; }   Save your page, and test it in a browser. If you notice that the “Trillium Media Design” text  seems to crowd the left margin, add a   nonbreaking space special character in the body  of the web page after the opening   tag.  Configure  the  CSS  rule  to  use  the  same  font  typeface  as  the  h1  selector  and  to  display centered text.  3.5 Configuring Text with CSS  93  Configure the h2 Selector  h2 { background-color: AEAED4;  color: 191970;  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;  text-align: center; }  Confi gure the Paragraphs  Edit  the  HTML,  and  remove  the  line  break  tag  that  is  after  the  first  sentence  of  each paragraph;  these line breaks look a bit awkward. Next, configure text in paragraphs to display just slightly  smaller than the default text size. Use the font-size property set to .90em. Configure the first  line of each paragraph to be indented. Use the text-indent property to configure a 3em indent.  p { font-size: .90em;  text-indent: 3em; }  Confi gure the Unordered List  Configure the text displayed in the unordered list to be bold.  ul { font-weight: bold; }  Save your page as embedded2.html, and test it in a browser. Your page should look similar to the  one  shown  chapter3 embedded2.html.  in  Figure  3.13   .  The  student   files  contain  a  sample  solution  at  CSS is quite powerful—just a few lines of code significantly changed the appearance of the web  page. You may be wondering if even more customization is possible. For example, what if you did   not want all the paragraphs to display in exactly the same way? While you could add inline styles to  the  web  page  code,  that  is  usually  not  the  most  efficient  technique.  The  next  section introduces the  CSS class and id selectors, which are widely utilized to configure specific page elements.  Figure 3.13 CSS  confi gures color  and text  properties on the  web page  94  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  FAQ Is there a quick way to apply the same styles to more than one HTML  tag or more than one class?  Yes, you can apply the same style rules to multiple selectors  such as HTML elements, classes,  or ids  by listing the selectors in front of the style rule. Place a comma between each selector.  The following code sample shows the font-size of 1em being applied to both the paragraph  and list-item elements:  p, li { font-size: 1em; }  3.6  CSS Class, id, and Contextual Selectors  The Class Selector  Use a CSS class selector when you need to apply a CSS declaration to certain elements  on a web page and not necessarily tie the style to a particular HTML element. See  Figure 3.14 , and notice that the last two items in the unordered list are displayed in a  different color than the others; this is an example of using a class. When setting a style  for a class, configure the class name as the selector. Place a dot, or period  . , in front of  the class name in the style sheet. The following code configures a class called feature in  a style sheet with a foreground  text  color set to red:  .feature { color: FF0000; }  The styles set in the new class can be applied to any element you wish. You do this by  using the class attribute, such as class="feature" . Do not type the dot in front of the  class value in the opening tag where the class is being applied. The following code will  apply the feature class styles to a   element:   Usability Studies   The id Selector  Use a CSS id selector to identify and apply a CSS rule uniquely to a single area on a web  page. For example, the copyright information in the page footer in Figure 3.14 displays in  small italic text with a gray color  333333 . This style could have been configured with  a class. However, because the page will have only one footer area, an id is more appro-  priate. When setting a style for an id, place a hash mark    in front of the id name in the  style sheet. The following code will configure an id called footer in a style sheet with   gray, small, italic text:  footer { color: 333333;  font-size: .75em;  font-style: italic; }  The styles set in the footer id can be applied to any element you wish by using the id  attribute, id="footer" . Do not type the  in front of the id value in the opening tag. The  following code will apply the footer id styles to a div tag:   This paragraph will be displayed using styles  configured in the footer id.   3.6 CSS Class, id, and Contextual Selectors  95  Using CSS with an id selector is similar to using CSS with a class selector. Use an id  selector to configure a single element on a web page. Use a class selector to configure  one or more elements on a web page.  Figure 3.14 Using  classes and ids  Hands-On Practice 3.4  In this Hands-On Practice, you will modify the CSS and the HTML in the Trillium Technologies page  to  confi  gure  the  navigation  and  page  footer  areas.  Launch  a  text  editor,  and  open embedded2.html.  Configure the Navigation Area  The navigation links would be more prominent if they were displayed in a larger and bolder font.  Create a class named nav that sets the font-size and font-weight properties.  .nav { font-weight: bold;   font-size: 1.25em; }  Modify the opening div tag of the navigation area. Add a class attribute that associates the div  with the nav class as follows:    Home    Services    Contact    Configure the Content Area  Trillium Technologies would like to draw attention to its new usability and search optimization  services. Create a class named feature that configures the text color to be red  ff0000 .  .feature { color: ff0000; }  Modify the last two items in the unordered list. Add a class attribute to each opening li tag that  96  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  associates the list item with the feature class as follows:   Usability Studies    Search Engine Optimization   Configure the Footer Area  Create an id named footer that sets the text color, font-size, and font-style properties.  footer { color: 333333;  font-size: .75em;  font-style: italic; }  id class:  Modify the opening div tag of the footer area to add an id attribute that associates div with the   Copyright   2012 Your Name Here   Save your file as embedded3.html, and test it in a browser. Your page should look  similar to the image shown in Figure 3.14 . The student files contain a sample solution at  chapter3 embedded3.html. Notice how the class and id styles are applied.  FAQ How do you choose class and id names?  You can choose almost any name you wish for a CSS class or id. However, CSS class names  are more flexible and easier to maintain over time if they are descriptive of the structure rather  than of specific formatting. For example, a class name of largeBold would no longer be mean-  ingful if the design were changed to display the area differently; however, a structural class  name such as nav, header, footer, content, or subheading is meaningful regardless of how the  area is configured. Here are more hints for class names:  ● Use short, but descriptive, names.  ● Both letters and numbers may be used.  ● Avoid spaces in class names.  ● Class names are not case sensitive, but consistency will make page maintenance easier.  A final tip about CSS classes is to be wary of “classitis”—that is, creating a brand new class  each time you need to configure text a bit differently. Decide ahead of time how you will  configure page areas, code your classes, and apply them. The result will be a more cohesive   and better organized web page.  The Contextual Selector  Use a CSS contextual selector when you want to specify an element within the context  of its container  parent  element. Contextual selectors are sometimes referred to as  descendent selectors. To configure a contextual selector, list the container selector   which can be an element selector, class, or id  followed by the specific selector you are  3.7 Span Element  97  3.7  Span Element  styling. For example, to specify a green text color only for anchor tags located within the  footer id declared earlier, code the following style rule:  footer a { color: 00ff00; }  You will get practice with contextual selectors in Chapters 6 and 7 . The next section  introduces a new HTML element that is useful when configuring page areas.  Recall from Chapter 2 that the div element configures a section or division on a web  page with empty space above and below. The div element is useful when you need to  format a section that is physically separated from the rest of the web page, referred to  as a block display. In contrast, the span element defines a section on a web page that is  not physically separated from other areas; this formatting is referred to as inline dis-  play. Use the   tag if you need to format an area that is contained within another,  such as within a   ,   ,   , or   tag.  Hands-On Practice 3.5  You will experiment with the span element in this Hands-On Practice by confi guring a new class  to format the company name when it is displayed within the text on the page and using the   span  98  element to apply this class. Open the embedded3.html fi le in a text editor. Your web page will look  similar to the one shown in Figure 3.15 after the changes are complete.  Figure 3.15 This web page uses the span element  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  Configure the Company Name  View Figure 3.15 , and notice that the company name, Trillium Technologies, is displayed in bold  and serif font within the first paragraph. You will code both CSS and HTML to configure this  formatting. First, create a new CSS rule that configures a class called companyname in bold,  serif font, and 1.25em in size. The code follows:  .companyname { font-weight: bold;  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;  font-size: 1.25em; }  Next, modify the beginning of the first paragraph of HTML to use the span element to apply the  class as follows:    Trillium Media Design  will bring  Save your file, and test it in a browser. Your page should look similar to the one shown in  Figure 3.15 . The student files contain a sample solution at chapter3 embedded4.html. View the  source code for your page, and review the CSS and HTML code. Note that all the styles were  located in a single place on the web page. Since embedded styles are coded in a specific loca-  tion, they are easier to maintain over time than inline styles. Also notice that you needed to code  the styles for the h2 element selector only once  in the head section , and both of the    elements applied the h2 style. This approach is more efficient than coding the same inline style  on  each     element.  However,  it  is  uncommon  for  a  website  to  have  only  one  page. Repeating  the CSS in the head section of each web page file is inefficient and difficult to maintain. In the next  section, you will use a more efficient approach: configuring an external style sheet.  The flexibility and power of CSS are best utilized when the CSS is external to the web  page document. An external style sheet is a text file with a .css file extension that  contains CSS style rules. The external style sheet file is associated with a web page by  3.8  Using External Style Sheets  VideoNote  External Style  Sheets  using the link element. This approach provides a way for multiple web pages to be  associated with the same external style sheet file. The external style sheet file does not  contain any HTML tags; it contains only CSS style rules.  The advantage of external CSS is that styles are configured in a single file. This means  that when styles need to be modified, only one file needs to be changed, instead of  multiple web pages. On large sites, this approach can save a web developer much time   and increase productivity. Let’s get some practice with this useful technique.  Link Element  The link element associates an external style sheet with a web page. It is placed in  the head section of the page and is a stand-alone, void tag. In HTML5 syntax, the link  element is coded as   . When using XHTML syntax, the link element is coded as    . Three attributes are used with the link element: rel, href, and type.  ● The value of the rel attribute is “ stylesheet ”.  ● The value of the href attribute is the name of the style sheet file.  3.8 Using External Style Sheets  99  ● The value of the type attribute is "text css" , which is the MIME type for CSS.  The type attribute is optional in HTML5 and required in XHTML.  Code the following in the head section of a web page to associate the document with  the external style sheet named color.css:     Hands-On Practice 3.6  Let’s practice using external styles. First, you will create an external style sheet. Next, you will  confi gure a web page to be associated with the external style sheet.  Create an External Style Sheet  Launch a text editor, and type in the following style rules to set the background color of a page  to blue and the text color to white. Save the file as color.css.  body { background-color: 0000FF;  color: FFFFFF; }  Figure 3.16 shows the external color.css style sheet displayed in Notepad. Notice that there is  no HTML in this file. HTML tags are not coded within an external style sheet. Only CSS rules   selectors, properties, and values  are coded in an external style sheet.  To create the web page shown in Figure 3.17 , launch a text editor and open the template file located  at chapter2 template.html in the student files. Modify the title element, add a link tag to the head  section,  and  add  a  paragraph  to  the  body  section  as  indicated  by  the  following  highlighted code:  Figure 3.16 The external  style sheet color.css  Confi gure the Web Page             External Styles                      This web page uses an external style sheet.   Save your file as external.html. Launch a browser, and test your page. It should look similar to  the page shown in Figure 3.17 . You can compare your work with the solution in the student files   chapter3 external.html . The color.css style sheet can be associated with any number of web  pages. If you ever need to change the style of formatting, you need to change only a single file  100  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS   color.css  instead of multiple files  all of the web pages . As mentioned earlier, this technique   can  boost productivity on a large site.  Figure 3.17 This page is  associated with an external  style sheet  to use an external style sheet.  Hands-On Practice 3.7  The advantage of having only a single file to update is significant for both small and large  websites. In the next Hands-On Practice, you will modify the Trillium Technologies home page  In this Hands-On Practice, you will continue to gain experience using external style sheets as you  create the external style sheet fi le named trillium.css, modify the Trillium Technologies home page  to use external styles instead of embedded styles, and associate a second web page with the  trillium.css style sheet.  A version of the Trillium home page is in the student files. Open the embedded4.html file in a browser.  The  display  should  be  the  same  as  the  web  page  shown  in  Figure  3.15  from  Hands-On Practice 3.5.  Figure 3.18  The external  style sheet  named  trillium.css  3.8 Using External Style Sheets  101  Now that you’ve seen what you’re working with, let’s begin. Launch a text editor, and save the  file  as  index.html  in  a  folder  called  trillium.  You  are  ready  to  convert  the  embedded  CSS  to exter-  nal CSS. Select the CSS rules  all the lines of code between, but not including, the opening and  closing   tags . Use Edit > Copy, or press the Ctrl + C keys  Cmd + C keys on a Mac ,  to copy the CSS code to the clipboard. Now you will place the CSS in a new file. Launch a text  editor and create a new file. Use Edit > Paste ,or press the Ctrl + V keys  Cmd + V keys on a   Mac , to paste the CSS style rules. Save the file as trillium.css. See Figure 3.18 for a screenshot  of the new trillium.css file in Notepad. Notice that there are no HTML elements in trillium.css—  not even the   element. The file contains CSS rules only.  Next, edit the index.html file in a text editor. Delete the CSS code you just copied. Delete the  closing   tag. Replace the opening   tag with a link element to associate the  style sheet named trillium.css. The   tag code is as follows:     Save the file, and test it in a browser. Your web page should look just like the one shown in  Figure 3.15 . Although it looks the same, the difference is in the code: The page now uses  external, instead of embedded, CSS.  Now, for the fun part—you will associate a second page with the style sheet. The student  files contain a services.html page for Trillium at chapter3 services.html. When you display  this page in a browser, it should look similar to the one shown in Figure 3.19 . Notice that  although the structure of the page is similar to the home page, the styling of the text and  colors is absent.  Figure 3.19 The services.html page is not associated with a style sheet  Launch a text editor to edit the services.html file. As you view the HTML code, you will notice  that this page is ready for our trillium.css styles—for example, the nav class and footer id have  been coded as attributes in the corresponding navigation and page footer areas. All that is left  for you to do is to code an HTML   tag to associate the services.html web page with the  102  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS    tag:     trillium.css  external  style  sheet.  Place  the  following  code  in  the  header  section  above  the closing   Save your file, and test it in a browser. Your page should look similar to Figure 3.20 —the CSS  rules have been applied!  Figure 3.20  The services.html  page has been  associated with  trillium.css  in the chapter3 3.7 folder.  If you click the Home and Services hyperlinks, you can move back and forth between the  index.html and services.html pages in the browser. The student files contain a sample solution  Notice that when using an external style sheet, if the use of color or fonts on the page ever  needs to be changed, modifications are made only to the external style sheet. Think about how  this approach can improve productivity on a site with many pages. Instead of modifying hun-  dreds of pages to make a color or font change, only a single file—the CSS external style sheet —  needs to be updated. Becoming comfortable with CSS will be important as you develop your  skills and increase your technical expertise.  Checkpoint 3.2  Describe a reason to use embedded styles.

You may decide to configure classes or ids in  ● Create one prototype page that contains most of the elements you plan to use and test.  your CSS to configure these areas.  Revise your CSS as needed.   ● Plan and test. These are important activities when designing a website.  3.9  Center HTML Elements with CSS  You learned how to center text on a web page earlier in this chapter—but what about  centering the entire web page itself? A popular page layout design that is easy to  accomplish with just a few lines of CSS is to center the entire contents of a web page  within a browser viewport. The key is to configure a div element that contains, or  “wraps,” the entire page content. The HTML follows:        . page content goes here .  .  .  .  .        margin-left  and  margin-right  width  property configures  wrapper { width: 700px;  margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto; }  Next, configure CSS style rules for this container. As will be discussed further in  Chapter 6 , the margin is the empty space surrounding an element. In the case of the  body element, the margin is the empty space between the page content and the edges  of the browser window. As you might expect, the  properties configure the space in the left and right margins, respectively. The margins  can be set to 0, pixel units, em units, percentages, or auto. When margin-left and  margin-right are both set to auto, the browser calculates the amount of space available  and divides it evenly between the left and right margins. The  the width of a block display element. The following CSS code sample sets the width of  an id named wrapper to 700 pixels and centers it:  You’ll practice this technique in the next Hands-On Practice.   104  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  Hands-On Practice 3.8  In this Hands-On Practice, you will code CSS properties to confi gure a centered page layout,  using the fi les from Hands-On Practice 3.7 as a starting point. Create a new folder called  trillium2. Locate the chapter3 3.7 folder in the student fi les. Copy the index.html, services.html,  and trillium.css fi les to your trillium2 folder. Open the trillium.css fi le in a text editor. Create an id  named wrapper. Add the margin-left, margin-right, and width style properties to the style rules  as follows:  wrapper { margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;  width: 80%; }  Save the file.  Open  the  index.html  file  in  a  text  editor.  Add  the  HTML  code  to  configure  a  div  element assigned  to the id wrapper that “wraps,” or contains, the code within the body section. Save the file.  When you test your index.html file in a browser, it should look similar to the page shown in  Figure 3.21 . The student files contain a sample solution in the chapter3 3.8 folder.  Figure 3.21 The page content is centered within the browser viewport  FAQ Is there an easy way to add a comment for documentation purposes in CSS?  Yes. An easy way to add a comment to CSS is to type " *" before your comment and "* "  after your comment, as shown in the following example:   * Configure Footer *   footer { font-size: .80em; font-style: italic; text-align: center; }   3.10 The “Cascade”  105  3.10  The “Cascade”  Figure 3.22 shows the “cascade”   rules of precedence   that applies the styles in  order from outermost  external styles  to innermost  HTML attributes coded on the  page . This set of rules allows the sitewide styles to be configured, but overridden  when needed by more granular page-specific styles  such as embedded or inline  Figure 3.22 The “cascade” of Cascading  styles .  Style Sheets  External styles can apply to multiple pages. If a web page contains both a link to an  external style sheet and embedded styles, the external styles will be applied first, and  then the embedded styles will be applied. This approach allows a web developer to  override global external styles on selected pages.  If a web page contains both embedded styles and inline styles, the embedded styles are  applied first, and then the inline styles are applied. This approach allows a web devel-  oper to override pagewide styles for particular HTML tags or classes.  Any XHTML tag or attribute will override styles. For example, a   tag will over-  ride corresponding font-related styles configured for an element. If no attribute or style  is applied to an element, the browser’s default is applied. However, the appearance of  the browser’s default may vary by browser, and you might be disappointed with the  result. Use CSS to specify the properties of your text and web page elements. Avoid  depending on the browser’s default.  In addition to the general cascade of CSS types described previously, the style rules  themselves follow rules of precedence. Style rules applied to more local elements  such  as a paragraph  take precedence over those applied to more global elements  such as a    that contains the paragraph .  Let’s look at an example of the cascade. Consider the following CSS code:  .content { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }  p { font-family: "Times New Roman", serif; }  The CSS has two style rules: a rule creating a class named content that configures text  using the Arial  or generic sans-serif  font family, and a rule configuring all paragraphs  to use the Times New Roman  or generic serif  font family. The HTML on the page   106  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  contains a   with multiple elements, such as headings and paragraphs, as shown  in the following code:      Main Heading   the div.       This is a paragraph. Notice how the paragraph is contained in  Here is how the browser would render the code:  1. The text contained in the heading is displayed with Arial font because it is part  of the   assigned to the content class. It inherits the properties from its  parent       class. This is an example of inheritance , in which certain CSS  properties are passed down to elements nested within a container element, such  as a   or   element. Text-related properties  font-family, color, etc.   are generally inherited, but box-related properties  margin, padding, width, etc.   are not. See http:  www.w3.org TR CSS21 propidx.html for a detailed list of CSS  properties and their inheritance status.  2. The text contained in the paragraph is displayed with Times New Roman font  because the browser applies the styles associated with the most local element   the paragraph . Even though the paragraph is contained in  and is considered a  child of  the content class, the local paragraph style rules takes precedence and  are applied by the browser.  Don’t worry if CSS and rules of precedence seem a bit overwhelming at this point.  CSS definitely becomes easier with practice. You will get a chance to practice with the  “cascade” as you complete the next Hands-On Practice.  Hands-On Practice 3.9  You will experiment with the “cascade” in this Hands-On Practice as you work with a web page  that uses external, embedded, and inline styles.  1. Create a new folder named mycascade.  2. Launch a text editor. Open a new fi le. Save the fi le as site.css in the mycascade folder.  You will create an external style sheet that sets the background-color of the web page  to a shade of yellow  FFFFCC  and the text color to black  000000 . The code  follows:  body { background-color: FFFFCC;  color: 000000; }  Save and close the site.css fi le.  3. Open a new fi le in the text editor, and save it as mypage1.html in the mycascade folder. The  web page will be associated with the external style sheet site.css, use embedded styles  to set the global text color to blue, and use inline styles to confi gure the text color of the   second paragraph. The fi le mypage1.html will contain two paragraphs of text. The code for  3.11 CSS Validation  107  mypage1.html follows:            The Cascade in Action         body { color: 0000FF; }               This paragraph applies the external and embedded styles  — note how the blue text color that is configured in  the embedded styles takes precedence over the black text color  configured in the external stylesheet.    Inline styles configure this paragraph  to have red text and take precedence over the embedded and  external styles.         Figure 3.23 Mixing external,  embedded, and inline styles  Save mypage1.html, and display it in a browser. Your page should look similar to the sample shown  in Figure 3.23 . The student files contain a sample solution at chapter3 cascade mypage1.html.  Take a moment to examine the mypage1.html web page and compare it with its source code. The  web page picked up the yellow background from the external style sheet. The embedded style  configured the text to be the color blue, which overrides the black text color in the external style  sheet. The first paragraph in the web page does not contain any inline styles, so it inherits the style  rules  in  the  external  and  embedded  style  sheets.  The  second  paragraph  contains  an  inline style of  red text color; this setting overrides the corresponding external and embedded styles.  3.11  CSS Validation   The W3C has a free Markup Validation Service   http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator    that will validate your CSS code and check it for syntax errors. CSS validation provides  students with quick self-assessment—you can prove that your code uses correct syntax.  VideoNote  CSS Validation  In the working world, CSS validation serves as a quality assurance tool. Invalid code  may cause browsers to render the pages more slowly than otherwise.  108  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  Hands-On Practice 3.10  In this Hands-On Practice, you will use the W3C CSS Validation Service to validate an exter-  nal CSS style sheet. This example uses the color.css fi le completed in Hands-On Practice 3.6   student fi les chapter3 color.css . Locate color.css, and open it in a text editor. Now add an error  to the color.css fi le By fi nding the body element selector style rule and deleting the fi rst “r” in the  background-color property. Add another error by removing the  from the color property  value. Save the fi le.  Next, attempt to validate the color.css file. Visit the W3C CSS Validation Service page at  http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator and select the “by File Upload” tab. Click the Browse button  and select the color.css file from your computer. Click the Check button. Your display should  be  similar  to  that  shown  in  Figure  3.24  .  Notice  that  two  errors  were  found.  The  selector  is listed,  followed by the reason an error was noted.  Figure 3.24 The validation results indicate errors  Notice that the first message in Figure 3.24 indicates that the “ backgound-color ”  property does not exist. This is a clue to check the syntax of the property name.  Edit color.css and correct the first error. Test and revalidate your page. Your browser  should now look similar to the one shown in Figure 3.25 and should be reporting only   one error.  and test again.  The error reminds you that FFFFFF is not a color value; you are expected to already know that  you need to add a "" character to code a valid color value, as in FFFFFF . Notice how any  valid CSS rules are displayed below the error messages. Correct the color value, save the file,  Your results should look similar to those shown in Figure 3.26 . There are no errors listed. The  Valid CSS Information contains all the CSS style rules in color.css. This means your file passed  3.11 CSS Validation  109  Figure 3.25 The valid CSS code is displayed below the errors  and warnings, if any   the CSS validation test. Congratulations, your color.css file is valid CSS syntax! It is good  practice to validate your CSS style rules. The CSS validator can help you to quickly identify  code that needs to be corrected and indicate which style rules a browser is likely to consider  valid. Validating CSS code is one of the many productivity techniques that web developers   commonly use.  Figure 3.26 The CSS is valid!

Hands-On Exercises  Write the HTML for a paragraph that uses inline styles to configure the background  color of red and the text color of white.  2. Write the HTML and CSS code for an embedded style sheet that configures a back-  ground color of eaeaea and a text color of 000033.  3. Write the CSS code for an external style sheet that configures the text to be brown,  1.2em in size, and in Arial, Verdana, or a sans-serif font.  4. Write the HTML and CSS code for an embedded style sheet that configures a class  called new that is bold and italic.  5. Write the HTML and CSS code for an embedded style sheet that configures  links without underlines; a background color of white; text color of black;  is in Arial, Helvetica, or a sans-serif font; and has a class called new that is bold  6.

Practice with External Style Sheets. In this exercise, you will create two external  style sheet files and a web page. You will experiment with linking the web page to  the external style sheets and note how the display of the page is changed.  a. Create an external style sheet  call it format1.css  to format as follows: document  background color of white, document text color of 000099, and document font  family of Arial, Helvetica, or sans-serif. Hyperlinks should have a background  color of gray  CCCCCC . Configure the h1 selector to use the Times New Roman  font with red text color.  b. Create an external style sheet  call it format2.css  to format as follows: document  background color of yellow and document text color of green. Hyperlinks should  have a background color of white. Configure the h1 selector to use the Times New  Roman font with white background color and green text color.  c. Create a web page about your favorite movie that displays the movie name in an    tag, a description of the movie in a paragraph, and an unordered  bulleted   list of the main actors and actresses in the movie. The page should also have a  hyperlink to a website about the movie. Place an e-mail link to yourself on the  web page. This page should be associated with the format1.css file. Save the  page as moviecss1.html. Be sure to test your page in more than one browser.  Modify the moviecss1.html page to link to the format2.css external style sheet  instead of the format1.css file. Save the page as moviecss2.html and test it in a  browser. Notice how different the page looks!  8. Practice with the Cascade. In this exercise, you will create two web pages that link  to the same external style sheet. After modifying the configuration in the external  style sheet, you will test your pages again and find that they automatically pick up  the new style configuration. Finally, you will add an inline style to one of the pages  and find that it takes effect and overrides the external style.  a. Create a web page that includes an unordered list describing at least three  advantages of using CSS. The text “CSS Advantages” should be contained within    tags. This page should include a hyperlink to the W3C website. Write the  HTML code so that one of the advantages is configured to be a class called  news. Place an e-mail link to yourself on the web page. The web page should  be associated with the external style sheet called ex8.css. Save the page as  advantage.html.  b. Create an external style sheet  call it ex8.css  to format as follows: document  background color of white; document text color of 000099; and document font  family of Arial, Helvetica, or sans-serif. Hyperlinks should have a background  color of gray  CCCCCC .   elements should use the Times New Roman font  with black text color. The news class should use red italic text.  c. Launch a browser, and test your work. Display the advantage.html page. It  should use the formatting configured in ex8.css. Modify the web page or the CSS  file until your page displays as requested.  d. Change the configuration of the external style sheet  ex8.css  to use a docu-  ment background color of black, document text color of white, and     text color of gray  CCCCCC . Save the file. Launch a browser, and test the  advantage.html page. Notice how it picks up the new styles from the external  e. Modify the advantage.html file to use an inline style.

Notice how the   text color specified in the  style sheet is overridden by the inline style.  9. Practice Validating CSS. Choose a CSS external style sheet file to validate;  perhaps you have created one for your own website. Otherwise, use an external  style sheet file that you worked with in this chapter. Use the W3C CSS validator at  http:  jigsaw.w3.org css- validator . If your CSS does not immediately pass the  validation test, modify it and test again. Repeat this process until the W3C validates  your CSS code. Write a one- or two-paragraph summary about the validation  process that answers the following questions: Was the CSS validator easy to use?  Did anything surprise you? Did you encounter a number of errors or just a few? How  easy was it to determine how to correct the CSS file? Would you recommend the  validator to other students? Why or why not?  This chapter has introduced you to using CSS to configure web pages. Use a search  engine to find CSS resources. The following resources can help you get started:  Web Research  1.    http:  www.w3.org Style CSS    http:  positioniseverything.net    http:  www.dezwozhere.com links.html  Create a web page that provides a list of at least five CSS resources on the Web.  For each CSS resource, provide the URL, website name, and a brief description.  Configure text and background colors with good contrast. Place your name in the  e-mail address at the bottom of the web page.  2. There is still much for you to learn about CSS. A great place to learn about web  technology is the Web itself. Use a search engine to search for CSS tutorials. The  following resources can help you get started:    http:  www.echoecho.com css.htm    http:  www.w3schools.com css    http:  www.davesite.com webstation css  Choose a tutorial that is easy to read. Select a section that discusses a CSS  technique that was not covered in this chapter. Create a web page that uses this  new technique. The web page should provide the URL of your tutorial, the name  of the website, and a description of the new technique you discovered. Place your  name in the e-mail address at the bottom of the web page.  Focus on Web Design  In this chapter, you have learned how to confi gure color and text with CSS. In this activity,  you will design a color scheme, code an external CSS fi le for the color scheme, and code  an example web page that applies the styles you confi gured. Use any of the following   sites to help you get started with color and web design ideas:  Psychology of Color    http:  www.infoplease.com spot colors1.html    http:  www.sensationalcolor.com meanings.html    http:  designfestival.com the-psychology-of-color    http:  www.designzzz.com infographic-psychology-color-web-designers    http:  www.digital-web.com articles color_theory_for_the_colorblind  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  116  Color Theory    http:  www.colormatters.com colortheory.html    http:  colortheory.liquisoft.com   Color Scheme Generators    http:  meyerweb.com eric tools color-blend    http:  colorschemer.com schemes    http:  www.colr.org    http:  colorsontheweb.com colorwizard.asp    http:  kuler.adobe.com    http:  colorschemedesigner.com  Complete the following tasks:  a. Design a color scheme. List three hexadecimal color values in addition to neutral  colors such as white  FFFFFF  or black  000000  in your design.  b. Describe the process you went through as you selected the colors. Describe why you  chose these colors. What type of website would they be appropriate for? List the  URLs of any resources you used.  c. Create an external CSS file named color1.css that configures font properties,  text color, and background color selections for the document, h1 element  selector, p element selector, and footer class, using the colors you  d.

WEBSITE CASE STUDY  Implementing CSS  Each of the case studies in this section continues throughout most of the text. This  chapter implements CSS in the websites.  JavaJam Coffee House  See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the JavaJam Coffee House Case Study. Figure 2.25  shows a site map for the JavaJam website. The Home page and Menu page were created  in Chapter 2 . You will develop a new version of the website that uses an external style  sheet to configure text and color. Figure 2.26 depicts the wireframe page layout.   Website Case Study  You have the following tasks:  117  1.  Create a new folder for this JavaJam case study.  2. Create an external style sheet named javajam.css that confi gures the color and text  for the JavaJam website.  3. Modify the Home page to utilize an external style sheet to confi gure colors and fonts.  The new Home page and color swatches are shown in Figure 3.27 .  4. Modify the Menu page to be consistent with the new Home page.  5. Confi gure centered page layout.  Figure 3.27 New JavaJam index.html  Hands-On Practice Case  Task 1: Create a folder on your hard drive or portable storage device called  javajamcss. Copy all the fi les from your Chapter 2 javajam folder into the  javajamcss folder.  Task 2: The External Style Sheet. You will use a text editor to create an external style  sheet named javajam.css. Code the CSS to confi gure the following:  1. Global styles for the document  use the body element selector  with background  color ffffcc; text color 330000; and Verdana, Arial, or any sans-serif font.  2. Styles for the h1 element selector that confi gure background color ccaa66, text  color 000000, 200% line height, and centered text.  3. Styles for the navigation area  use an id named nav   that confi gure centered text.  Hint : Use the CSS text-align property.  4. Styles for the page footer area  use an id named footer   that confi gure  background color ccaa66, text color 000000, small font size  .60em , italics,  and centered text.  Save the fi le as javajam.css in the javajamcss folder. Check your syntax with the CSS  validator   http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator  . Correct and retest if necessary.  118  Chapter 3 Configuring Color and Text with CSS  Task 3: The Home Page. Launch a text editor, and open the index.html fi le. You will  modify this fi le to apply styles from the javajam.css external style sheet as follows:   1. Add a   element to associate the web page with the javajam.css external  style sheet fi le. Save and test your index.html page in a browser and you’ll notice  that the styles confi gured with the body and h1 element selectors are already  2. Confi gure the navigation area. Assign the div that contains the navigation to the id  applied!  named nav . Hint :   .  3. Confi gure the page footer area. Remove the   and   elements, because the  font-size and font-style are confi gured as part of the footer id. Assign the div  that contains the footer information to the id named footer .  Save the index.html fi le, and test it in a browser. Your page should look similar to the  one shown in Figure 3.27 except that your page content will be left-aligned instead of  centered. Don’t worry—you’ll center your page layout in Task 5 of this case study.  Task 4: The Menu Page. Launch a text editor, and open the menu.html fi le. You will  modify this fi le in a similar manner as you modifi ed the home page: Add the    element, confi gure the navigation area, and confi gure the page footer area. Save and  test your new menu.html page. It should look similar to the one shown in Figure 3.28 ,  except for the alignment.  Task 5: Center Page Layout with CSS. Modify javajam.css, index.html, and menu.html  to confi gure page content that is centered with 80% width  refer to Hands-On Practice 3.8  1. Launch a text editor, and open the javajam.css fi le. Add a style rule for an id named  wrapper with width set to 80%, margin-right set to auto, and margin-left set  2. Launch a text editor, and open the index.html fi le. Add the HTML code to confi gure  a div element assigned to the id wrapper that “wraps,” or contains, the code within  the body section. Save and test your index.html page in a browser and you’ll notice  that the page content is now centered within the browser viewport as shown in  3. Launch a text editor, and open the menu.html fi le. Add the HTML code to confi gure  a div element assigned to the id wrapper that “wraps,” or contains, the code within  the body section. Save and test your menu.html page in a browser and you’ll notice  that the page content is now centered within the browser viewport as shown in  if necessary :  to auto.  Figure 3.27 .  Figure 3.28 .  Experiment with modifying the javajam.css fi le. Change the page background color, the  font family, and so on. Test your pages in a browser. Isn’t it amazing how a change in a  single fi le can aff ect multiple fi les when external style sheets are used?

This chapter introduces you to working with visual  elements on web pages.  When you include images on your website, it is important to remember that not  all users are able to view them. Some users may have vision problems and   need assistive technology such as a screen reader application that reads the  web page to them. In addition, search engines send out spiders and robots to  walk the web and catalog pages for their indexes and databases; such programs  do not access your images. Visitors using a mobile device may have images  disabled. As a web developer, strive to create pages that are enhanced by  graphical elements, but are usable without them.  129  130  4.1  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Configuring Lines and Borders  Web designers often use visual elements such as lines and borders to separate or  define areas on web pages. In this section, you’ll explore two coding techniques to  configure a line on a web page: the HTML horizontal rule element and the CSS border  and padding properties.  The Horizontal Rule Element  A horizontal rule element visually separates areas of a page and configures a horizontal  line across a web page. Since the horizontal rule element does not contain any text, it is  coded as a void tag and not in a pair of opening and closing tags. XHTML syntax for the  horizontal rule is   . HTML5 syntax for the horizontal rule is   . The horizontal  rule element has a new semantic meaning in HTML5, indicating a thematic break.  Horizontal rules are centered within their container element by default.  Hands-On Practice 4.1  Open the web page found at chapter4 starter1.html in the student fi les in a text editor. This fi le  should  be  familiar  to  you;  it  is  similar  to  the  web  page  you  worked  with  in  Chapter  3  .   See Figure  3.14 .  Add an   tag above the div element that contains the page footer.  Save your file as hr.html, and test it in a browser. The lower portion of your web page should  look similar to the partial screenshot shown in Figure 4.1 . Compare your work with the solution in  the student files  chapter4 hr.html . While a horizontal rule can be easily created using HTML, a  more modern technique for configuring lines on web pages is to use CSS to configure a border.  Figure 4.1 The    tag confi gures a horizontal line  The border and padding Properties  As you may have noticed when you configured background colors for heading elements  in Chapter 3 , block display HTML elements form the shape of a rectangular box on a web   page. This is an example of the CSS box model, which you will explore in detail in  Chapter 6 . For now, let’s focus on two CSS properties that can be configured for the  “box”: the border and padding properties.  The  border  Property  The border property configures the border, or boundary, around an element. By default,  the border has a width set to 0 and does not display. You can set the border-width ,  4.1 Configuring Lines and Borders  131  border-color , and border-style with the border property. And there’s more—you  can even configure individual settings for the top , right , bottom and left borders  using the border-top , border-right , border-bottom , and border-left properties.  The  border-style  Property  The border-style property configures the type of line displayed in the border. The  formatting options include inset , outset , double , groove , ridge , solid , dashed ,  and dotted . Be aware that these property values are not all uniformly applied by  browsers. Figure 4.2 shows how Firefox 4 and Internet Explorer 9 render various  Figure 4.2 Not all border-style values are rendered the same way  border-style values.  by popular browsers  The CSS to configure the borders shown in Figure 4.2 uses a border-width of 3 pixels,  the value indicated for the border-style property, and a border-color of 000000.  For example, the style rule to configure the dashed border follows:  A shorthand notation allows you to configure all the border properties in one style rule  by listing the values of border-width , border-style , and border-color , as in the  .dashedborder { border-width: 3px;  border-style: dashed;  border-color: 000033; }  .dashedborder { border: 3px dashed 000033; }  following example:  The  padding Property  The padding   property configures empty space between the content of the HTML  element  usually text  and the border. By default, the padding is set to 0. If you  configure a background color for an element, the color is applied to both the padding  and the content areas. You’ll apply the padding and border properties in the next  Hands-On Practice.

Hands-On Practice 4.2  In this Hands-On Practice you will work with the border and padding properties. Launch a text  editor, and open the web page found at chapter4 starter1.html in the student fi les. You will modify  the CSS style rules for the h1 element selector, h2 element selector, and footer id. When you are  fi nished, your page should look similar to the one shown in Figure 4.3 .  Edit the CSS style rules as follows:  1 . Modify  the  style  rules  for  the  h1  element  selector.

True or False: CSS can be used to configure visual elements such as rectangular shapes  Graphics can make web pages compelling and engaging. This section discusses features  of graphic files commonly used on the Web: GIF, JPEG, and PNG. A new web graphic format,  WepP, is also introduced.  Graphic Interchange Format  GIF  Images  GIF images are best used for line drawings containing mostly solid tones and simple  images such as clip art. The maximum number of colors in a GIF file is 256. GIF images  have a .gif file extension. Figure 4.5 shows a logo image created in GIF format.  and lines on web pages.  4.2  Types of Graphics  Figure 4.5 This  logo is a GIF  Transparency   The format GIF89A used by GIF images supports image transparency . In a graphics  application, such as the open-source GIMP, one color  typically the background color   of the image can be set to be transparent. The background color  or background image   of the web page shows through the transparent area in the image. Figure 4.6 displays  two GIF images on a blue textured background.  4.2 Types of Graphics  137  Figure 4.6  Comparison of  transparent and  nontransparent  GIFs  Animation  An animated GIF consists of several images or frames, each of which is slightly different.  When the frames display on the screen in order, the image appears animated. Animated  GIFs can be created in a graphics application such as Adobe Fireworks.  Compression  Lossless compression is used when a GIF is saved. This means that nothing in the origi-  nal image is lost and that the compressed image, when rendered by a browser, will con-  tain the same pixels as the original.  Optimization  To avoid slow-loading web pages, graphic files should be optimized for the Web. Image  optimization is the process of creating an image with the lowest file size that still  renders a good-quality image—balancing image quality and file size. GIF images are  typically optimized by reducing the number of colors in the image by using a graphics  application such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks, or GIMP.  Interlacing  Browsers render, or display, web page documents in order, line by line, starting at the  top of the document. They display standard images as the files are read in order from  top to bottom. The top of a standard image begins to display after 50 percent of the  image has been read by a browser. When a GIF graphic file is created, it can be config-  ured as interlaced. An interlaced image progressively displays and seems to fade in as  it downloads. The image first appears fuzzy but gradually becomes clearer and sharper,  which can help to reduce the perceived load time of your web page.  Joint Photographic Experts Group  JPEG  Images  JPEG images are best used for photographs. In contrast to a GIF image, a JPEG image  can contain 16.7 million colors. However, JPEG images cannot be made transparent, and  they cannot be animated. JPEG images have a .jpg or .jpeg file extension.  Compression  JPEG images are saved using lossy compression . This means that some pixels in the  original image are lost or removed from the compressed file. When a browser renders   the compressed image, the display is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the  original image.  Optimization  There are trade-offs between the quality of the image and the amount of compression.  An image with less compression will have higher quality and result in a larger file size.  138  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  An image with more compression will have lower quality and re-  sult in a smaller file size. Most graphics applications allow you to  preview the quality–compression trade-off and choose the image  that best suits your needs.  When you take a photo with a digital camera, the file size is too  large for optimal display on a web page. Figure 4.7 shows an  optimized version of a digital photo with an original file size of  250KB. The image was optimized using a graphics application set  to 80-percent quality, is now only 55KB, and displays well on a  web page.  Figure 4.7 A JPEG saved at 80-percent  Figure 4.8 was saved with 20 percent quality and is only  quality  55KB fi le size  displays well on a  19KB, but its quality is unacceptable. The quality of the image  web page  degrades as the file size decreases. The square blockiness  you see in Figure 4.8 is called pixelation and should be   avoided.  Another technique used with web graphics is to display a  small version of the image, called a thumbnail image . Often,  the thumbnail is configured as an image hyperlink that  displays the larger image when clicked. Figure 4.9 shows a  thumbnail image.  Progressive JPEG  When a JPEG file is created, it can be configured as progres-  sive. A progressive JPEG is similar to an interlaced GIF in that  Figure 4.8 JPEG saved at 20-percent  the image progressively displays and seems to fade in as it  quality  19KB file size   downloads.  Portable Network Graphic  PNG  Images  PNG images combine the best of GIF and JPEG images and will be a replacement for GIF  images in the future.

WebP   pronounced “weppy”  graphics are currently supported only by the Google  Chrome browser. Visit http:  code.google.com speed webp for more information  The image element configures graphics on a web page. These graphics can be photo-  graphs, banners, company logos, navigation buttons, and so on; you are limited only by  your creativity and imagination.  The image element is not coded as a pair of opening and closing tags. It is considered  to be a void element. Use   for XHTML syntax and   for HTML5 syntax. The  following code example configures an image named logo.gif, which is located in the  same folder as the web page:     The src attribute specifies the file name of the image. The alt attribute provides a  text replacement, typically a text description, of the image. The browser reserves the  correct amount of space for your image if you use the height and width attributes  with values either equal to or approximately the size of the image. Table 4.3 lists    tag attributes and their values. Commonly used attributes are shown in bold.

Although obsolete  in HTML5, they are still valid in XHTML so you’ll see them coded in existing web pages.  As you work through this book, you’ll use CSS to re-create the functions of these now-  obsolete attributes.  140  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  FAQ What if I don’t know the height and width of an image?  Most graphics applications can display the height and width of an image. If you have a graph-  ics application such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Fireworks handy, launch the application  and open the image. These applications include options that will display the properties of the  image, such as height and width.  If  you  don’t  have  a  graphics  application  available,  you  can  determine  the  dimensions  of  an image  by using a browser. Display the image on a web page. Right-click on the image to display the  context-sensitive menu. Select a menu option such as Properties or “View Image Info” to view the  dimensions  height and width  of the image.   Warning : If the height and width are specified on the  web  page,  those  values  will  be  displayed  even  if  the  image’s  actual  height  and  width  are different.   Accessibility and Images  Use the alt attribute to provide accessibility. Recall from Chapter 1 that Section 508 of   the Rehabilitation Act requires the use of accessibility features for new information tech-  nology  including websites  associated with the federal government. The alt attribute  Focus on  Accessibility  configures an alternative text description of the image. This alt text is used by the  browser in two ways. The browser will show the alt text in the image area before the  graphic is downloaded and displayed. Some browsers will also show the alt text as a  tool tip whenever a visitor to the web page places the mouse cursor over the image  area. Applications such as screen readers will read the text in the alt attribute out loud.  A mobile browser may display the alt text instead of the image.  Standard browsers such as Internet Explorer and Safari are not the only type of application  or user agent that can access your website. Major search engines run programs called  spiders or robots; these programs index and categorize websites. They cannot process  text within images, but some process the value of the alt attributes in image tags.  Image Hyperlinks  The code to make an image function as a hyperlink is very easy. To create an image  link, all you need to do is surround your image element with anchor tags. For example,  to place a link around an image called home.gif, use the following HTML code:   <img src="home.gif" height="19" width="85"  alt="Home">   When an image is used as a hyperlink, the default is to show a blue outline  border   around the image. If you would prefer not to display this outline, you could use the  border="0" attribute in your image tag as follows:   <img src="home.gif" height="19"  width="85" alt="Home" border="0">   A more modern approach is to use CSS to configure the border on the img selector. The  next Hands-On Practice will demonstrate this technique as you configure images and  add image links to a web page.   4.3 Image Element  141  Hands-On Practice 4.3  In this Hands-On Practice you will add a graphical logo banner and image navigation buttons  to a web page. Then you’ll confi gure the image buttons as image links. Create a new folder  called trilliumch4. The graphics used in this Hands-On Practice are located in the student fi les  chapter4 starters folder. Save the trilliumbanner.jpg, home.gif, services.gif, and contact.gif fi les in  your trilliumch4 folder. A starter version of the Trillium Media Design Home page is ready for you in  the  student  fi  les.  Save  the  chapter4 starter2.html  fi  le  to  your  trilliumch4  folder.  Launch  a browser  to display the starter2.html web page; notice that a monochromatic green color scheme has been  confi gured with CSS. When you are fi nished with this Hands-On Practice, your page will look  similar to the one shown in Figure 4.10 .  Figure 4.10 The new Trillium Home page with a logo banner  Launch a text editor, and open starter2.html in the trilliumch4 folder.  1. Confi gure the logo banner image:  ● Replace the text contained between the   opening and closing tags. Code an    element to display trilliumbanner.jpg in this area. Remember to include the src , alt ,  height , and width attributes. Sample code follows:  <img src="trilliumbanner.jpg" alt="Trillium Media Design"  width="700" height="86">  the image. Add the following style rule:  height: 86px;  ● Edit the embedded CSS to confi gure the h1 element selector to have the same height as   142  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  2. Confi gure the image links. Notice that the anchor tags are already coded; you’ll just need to  convert the text links to image links. However, before you start changing the code, let’s take  a minute to discuss accessibility. Whenever the main navigation consists of media, such as  an image, some individuals may not be able to see the images  or may have images turned  off in their browser . To provide navigation that is accessible to all, confi gure a set of plain-text  navigation links in the page footer area as follows:  ● Copy the   element containing the navigation area to the lower portion of the page,  and paste it above the page footer.  ● Modify the style rules in the nav class. Change the font size to .75em.  3. Now, focus on the top navigation area. Replace the text contained between each pair of  anchor tags with an image element. Use home.gif for the link to index.html, services.gif for  the link to services.html, and contact.gif for the link to contact.html. Sample code follows:   <img src="home.gif" alt="Home" width="120"  4. Edit the embedded CSS to create a new style rule that confi gures no border for the img  height="40">   element selector. The code follows:  img { border-style: none; }  Save your page as index.html in the trilliumch4 folder. Launch a browser, and test your page. It  should look similar to the one shown in Figure 4.10 . Note : If an image did not display on your web  page, verify that you have saved the trilliumbanner.jpg, home.gif, services.gif, and contact.gif files  in the trilliumch4 folder and that you have spelled the file name correctly in the   element.  As you test your page, resize the browser window, make it smaller, and note how the image  links move around. To prevent them from moving, add a new style rule to the body selector that  sets a minimum width for the page. This rule will cause the browser to automatically display a  horizontal scroll bar if a visitor to the web page resizes the browser window below the size  specified. Sample code follows:  min-width: 700px;  Save and test your page again. The student files contain a sample solution in the chapter4 4.3  folder. Isn’t it interesting how just a few images can add visual interest to a web page?  FAQ What if my images don't show?  The following are common reasons for images not displaying on a web page:  ● Are your images really in the website folder? Use Windows Explorer or Mac Finder to  double-check.  ● Did you code the HTML and CSS correctly? Check for common mistakes such as typing  scr instead of src and missing quotation marks.  ● Do your images have the exact file names that you have used in the background or src  attributes in your HTML code? Attention to detail and consistency will be very helpful here.   4.3 Image Element  143  FAQ How should I name my image files?  Guidelines for naming image files:  ● Use all lowercase letters.  ● Do not use punctuation symbols and spaces.  ● Do not change the file extensions  should be .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, or .png .  ● Keep your file names short, but descriptive. Here are some examples:  i1.gif is probably too short.  myimagewithmydogonmybirthday.gif is too long.  dogbday.gif may be just about right.  Optimize an Image for the Web  Photos taken with a digital camera are too large—in both their dimensions and their file  size—to display well on a web page. Recall that image optimization requires balancing  image quality and file size. It is the process of creating an image with the lowest file size  that still renders with good quality. Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Fireworks are often used  by  web  professionals  to  optimize  images  for  the  Web.  GIMP     http:  gimp.org    is  a  popular open-source image editor that supports multiple platforms. Pixlr offers a free, easy-to-use,  online photo editor at http:  pixlr.com editor.  Hands-On Practice 4.4  In  this  Hands-On  Practice  you  will  confi  gure  an  image  with  a  caption  on  a  web  page.  The photo  used in this Hands-On Practice is located in the student fi les chapter4 starters folder. Save the  myisland.jpg fi le in a folder named mycaption.  Step 1: Launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the template fi le located at chapter2   template.html in the student fi les. Modify the title element.

Assign the div to the id named fi gure. Save the  fi le as index.html in the mycaption folder. Launch a browser to test your page. It should look  similar to the page shown in Figure 4.12 . The student fi les contains a sample solution in the  In Hands-On Practice 4.4, you configured an image and a caption on a web page. You  used a div element to contain the image and text caption. In this section, you’ll explore  an approach that implements new HTML5 elements and requires a modern browser that  supports HTML5  such as Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet Explorer 9 . You’ll  use the new HTML5 figure and figcaption elements.  HTML5 Figure Element  The block display figure element comprises a unit of content that is self-contained,   such as an image, along with one optional figcaption element.  4.4 HTML5 Visual Elements  145  HTML5 Figcaption Element  Hands-On Practice 4.5  The block display figcaption element provides a caption for a figure.  In this Hands-On Practice you will confi gure an area on a web page that contains an image with a  caption by using the HTML5 fi gure and fi gcaption elements. The graphic used in this Hands- On  Practice is located in the student fi les chapter4 starters folder. Save the myisland.jpg fi le in a  folder named mycaption2.  Step 1: Launch a text editor. Select File > Open to edit the template fi le located at  chapter2 template.html in the student fi les. Modify the title element. Add an image tag  to the body section to display the myisland.jpg image as follows:  <img src="myisland.jpg" alt="Tropical Island" height="480"  width="640">  Save the fi le as index.html in the mycaption2 folder. Launch a browser to test your page. It should  look similar to the page shown in Figure 4.11 .  Step 2: Confi gure a fi gure caption and border for the image. Launch a text editor and open the  web page fi le. Add embedded CSS to the head section that confi gures the fi gure element  selector to be 640 pixels wide, with a border, and with padding set to 5px. Confi gure the  fi gcaption element  selector  to  have  centered  text  using  the  Papyrus  font  typeface   or  the default  fantasy family font . The code follows:     fi gure { width: 640px;  border: 1px solid 000000;  padding: 5px; }  fi gcaption { text-align: center;  font-family: Papyrus, fantasy; }     the fi gcaption. The code follows:        Tropical Island Getaway        Edit the body section. Below the image, add a figcaption element that contains the following  text: “Tropical Island Getaway.” Confi gure a figure element that contains both the image and      Save the fi le as index.html in the mycaption2 folder. Launch a browser to test your page. It should  look similar to the page shown in Figure 4.13 . The student fi les contains a sample solution in the  chapter4 caption2 folder.  146  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Figure 4.13 The  HTML5 fi gure and  fi gcaption elements  were used in this  web page  You might be wondering why these new HTML5 elements were created when the same  design can be configured using a div element as a container. The reason is semantics. The  div element is useful but very generic in nature. When the figure and figcaption elements  are used, the structure of the content is well defined. However, if you are designing pages  for commercial websites, hold off on using the new figure and figcaption elements until  browser support of HTML5 is more widespread.  HTML5 Meter Element  The meter element displays a visual gauge of a numeric value within a known range, typically  as part of a bar chart. At the time this textbook was written, this new HTML5 element was  supported only in the Chrome and Opera 11 browsers. The meter element is configured with  several attributes, including value  the value displayed , min  the lowest possible value in  the range , and max  the highest possible value in the range . The following code snippet   from the student files chapter4 meter.html  configures the display of a monthly browser-  usage report that shows total visits and the number of visits by users for each browser:   Monthly Browser Report    14417 14,417 Total  Visits    7000  7,000 Firefox    3800  3,800 Internet    2062  2,062 Chrome    1043  1,043 Safari    312       200      Explorer   312 Opera   200 other   4.5 Background Images  147  Figure 4.14 displays the page in the Opera browser.

For example, the following CSS code configures the  background of a web page to be a soft yellow:  body { background-color: ffff99; }  The background-image Property  Use the CSS background-image property to configure a background image. For exam-  ple, the following CSS code configures the HTML body selector with a background of the  graphic texture1.png located in the same folder as the web page file:  body { background-image: url texture1.png ; }  Using Both Background Color and a Background Image  You can configure both a background color and a background image. The back-  ground color  specified by the background-color property  will display first. Next,  the image specified as the background will be displayed as it is loaded by the  browser.   148  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  By coding both a background color and a background image, you provide your visitor  with a more pleasing visual experience. If the background image does not load for some  reason, the background color will still have the expected contrast with your text color. If  the background image is smaller than the web browser window and the web page is  configured with CSS not to automatically tile  repeat the image , the background color  of the page will display in areas not covered by the background image. The CSS for a  page with both a background color and a background image follows:  body { background-color: 99cccc;  background-image: url background.jpg ; }  Browser Display of a Background Image  You may think that a graphic created to be the background of a web page would  always be about the size of the browser window viewport. However, the dimensions of  the background image are often much smaller than the typical viewport. The shape of  a background image is often either a thin rectangle or a small rectangular block.  Unless otherwise specified in a style rule, browsers repeat, or tile, these images to  cover the page’s background, as shown in Figures 4.16 and 4.17 . The images have  small file sizes so that they download as quickly as possible.  Figure 4.16 A long, thin  background image tiles down  the page  Figure 4.17 A small rectangular  background is repeated to fi ll  the web page window   4.5 Background Images  149  The background-repeat Property  As just discussed, the default behavior of a browser is to repeat, or tile, background  images to cover the entire element’s background. This behavior also applies to other  elements, such as backgrounds for headings, paragraphs, and so on. You can change  this tiling behavior with the CSS background-repeat property . The values for the  background-repeat property include repeat  default , repeat-y  vertical repeat ,  repeat -x  horizontal repeat , and no-repeat  no repeat . Figure 4.18 provides examples  of the actual background image and the result of applying various background-repeat  property values.

Valid values for the background-  position property include percentages; pixel values; or left, top, center, bottom, and   150  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  right. The first value indicates horizontal position. The second  value indicates vertical position.

In Figure 4.19 , the small  confi gured to display on the right side with CSS  flower image has been placed in the background on the right  side of the element by using the following style rule:  h2 { background-image: url trilliumbg.gif ;  background-position: right;  background-repeat: no-repeat; }  Hands-On Practice 4.6  Let’s practice using a background image. You will update the index.html fi le from Hands-On  Practice  4.3   shown  in  Figure  4.10   .  In  this  Hands-On  Practice  you  will  confi  gure  the  h2 element  selector with a background image that does not repeat. Obtain the trilliumbullet.gif image from the  student fi les chapter4 starters folder. Save the image in your trilliumch4 folder. When you have  completed this exercise, your page should look similar to the one shown in Figure 4.20 .

Save your page as index.html. Launch a browser, and test your page. You may notice that  the text in the h2 element is displayed over the background image. In this case, the page  would look more appealing if there were more space, or padding, before the beginning of the  text displayed by the h2 elements. Use the CSS padding-left property to add empty  space within the left side of the element. Add the following declaration to the h2 element  selector to add empty space before the text:  padding-left: 30px;  3. Save and test your page again. It should look similar to the one shown in Figure 4.20 . The  student fi les contain a sample solution in the chapter4 4.6 folder.  FAQ What if my images are in their own folder?  It’s a good idea to organize your website by placing all your  images in a folder. Notice that the CircleSoft website whose  file structure is shown in Figure 4.21 contains a folder called  images, which contains GIF and JPEG files. To refer to these  files in code, you also need to refer to the images folder. The  following are some examples:  ● The CSS code to configure the background.gif file from  the images folder as the page background follows:  body { background-image:  url images background.gif ; }  Figure 4.21 A folder named  ● The HTML to display the logo.jpg file from the images  “images” contains the graphic   folder follows:  fi les  <img src="images logo.jpg"  alt="CircleSoft" width="588" height="120">  The background-attachment Property  Use the background-attachment property to configure whether the background image  remains fixed in place or scrolls along with the page in the browser viewport.

Topics discussed include image maps, the favorites icon, image slicing, and CSS Sprites.  An image map is an image that can be used as one or more hyperlinks. An image map  will typically have multiple clickable or selectable areas that link to another web page or  website. The selectable areas are called hotspots . You have probably used image maps  many times, but never realized it. One common use of image maps is to create interac-  tive maps that website visitors can manipulate to choose a location. Figure 4.22 shows  a page in the http:  nerrs.noaa.gov website that displays a map of the Ace Islands.  When a visitor selects an island, a new web page displays with detailed information   about the island.  Figure 4.22 An image map is used to select a location on this website  Most web authoring software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, provides wizards or other  tools to help you create image maps quickly and easily. If you don’t have access to a  web authoring tool to create an image map, the most difficult part is determining the  pixel coordinates of the hyperlink area. The coordinates are in pairs of numbers that  signify the number of pixels from the top and the number of pixels from the left edge of  the image. If you are working with a graphic artist, he or she may be able to supply you  with the coordinates. Another option is to open the image in a graphics application  such as Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Photoshop, or GIMP to obtain approximate coordi-  nates. You can modify these coordinate values as you work with the HTML on your web  page. Image maps can be used to create clickable areas in three shapes: rectangles,  circles, and polygons.  4.6 More About Images  153  An image map uses two new elements: map and area. The map element is a con-  tainer tag and is used to begin and end the image map. The name attribute is  coded to associate the   tag with its corresponding image. Configure the  image tag with the usemap attribute to indicate which   to use. For example,    will be associated with the  image map described by   . The id attribute uniquely  identifies the map area.  The   tag defines the coordinates or edges of the map area and uses  shape , coords , alt , and href attributes. XHTML syntax for the horizontal rule is    . Table 4.4 describes the type of coordinates   coords   needed for each  Table 4.4 Shape coordinates  shape value.  Shape  Coordinates  Meaning  rect  “x1,y1, x2,y2”  circle  “x,y,r”  The coordinates at point  x1,y1  represent the upper-left corner  of the rectangle. The coordinates at point  x2,y2  represent the  lower-right corner of the rectangle.  The coordinates at point  x,y  indicate the center of the circle.  The value of r is the radius of the circle, in pixels.  polygon  “x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3”, etc.  The values of each  x,y  pair represent the coordinates of a  corner point of the polygon.  We’ll focus on a rectangular image map. For a rectangular image map, the value of  the shape attribute is rect , and the coordinates indicate the pixel positions as   follows: distance of the upper-left corner from the left side of the image, distance of  the upper-left corner from the top of the image, distance of the lower-right corner  from the left edge of the image, and distance fo the lower-right corner from the top  of the image.  Figure 4.23 shows an image of a fishing boat. The dotted rectangle around the  fishing boat indicates the location of the hotspot. The coordinates shown  24, 188   indicate that the top-left corner is 24 pixels from the left edge of the image and  188 pixels from the top of the image. The pair of coordinates in the lower-right  corner  339, 283  indicates that this corner is 339 pixels from the left edge of the  image and 283 pixels from the top of the image. Visit the textbook’s website at  http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter4.html to see an image map in action. The  HTML code to create this image map follows:     http:  www.doorcountyvacations.com  coords="24, 188, 339, 283" alt="Door County Fishing">  <area href="  " shape="rect"     height="350">  <img src="fi shingboat.jpg" usemap="boat" alt="Door County" width="416"  Most web developers do not hand-code image maps. As mentioned previously, the easi-  est way to create a client-side image map is to use a web authoring tool, such as Adobe  Dreamweaver   http:  adobe.com dreamweaver   or Coffee Cup Software’s HTML Editor    http:  www.coffeecup.com html-editor  .   154  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Figure 4.23 Sample image map  The Favorites Icon  Ever wonder about the small icon you sometimes see in the address bar or tab of a  browser? That’s a favorites icon , usually referred to as a favicon , which is a square  image  either 16×16 pixels or 32×32 pixels  associated with a web page. The favicon,  shown in Figure 4.24 , may display in the browser’s address bar, tab, or the favorites and  bookmarks lists.  Figure 4.24 The favorites icon displays in the browser tab and address bar  You can create a favicon in a graphics application, such as Adobe Fireworks, or at a  number of websites including http:  www.favicongenerator.com , http:  www.favicon.cc ,  and http:  www.freefavicon.com . While some versions of Internet Explorer  version 6  and earlier  expected the file to be named favicon.ico and to reside in the root directory  of the web server, a more modern approach is to associate the favicon.ico file with a  web page by using the link element. Recall that in Chapter 3 , you coded the   tag  in the header section of a web page to associate an external style sheet file with a web  page file. You can also use the   tag to associate a favorites icon with a web page.  4.6 More About Images  155  Three attributes are used to associate a web page with a favorites icon: rel , href , and  type . The value of the rel attribute is icon . The value of the href attribute is the name  of the image file. The value of the type attribute describes the MIME type of the image—  which defaults to image x-icon for .ico files. The HTML code to associate a favorites  icon named favicon.ico to a web page follows:     Note that to be compatible with Internet Explorer and follow Microsoft’s proprietary   syntax, you’ll also need to code a second link tag:     Be aware that Internet Explorer’s support of the favorites icon is somewhat buggy. You  may need to publish your files to the Web  see the FTP tutorial in Appendix G  in order  for the favicon to display even in current versions of Internet Explorer. Other browsers,  such as Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera, display favicons more reliably and  also support GIF and PNG image formats.  Hands-On Practice 4.7  Let’s practice using a favorites icon. Obtain the favicon.ico fi le from the student fi les in the  chapter4 starters folder. In this exercise, you will use your fi les in the trilliumch4 folder from  Hands-On Practice 4.6  also see the student fi les chapter4 4.6 folder  as a starting point.  1. Launch a text editor, and open index.html. Add the following link tags to the head section of  the web page:        2. Save your page as index.html. Launch the Firefox browser, and test your page. You should  notice the small trillium fl ower in the Firefox browser tab as shown in Figure 4.25 . The student  fi les contain a sample solution in the chapter4 4.7 folder.  Figure 4.25 The favorites icon displays  in the Firefox browser tab  Image Slicing  Graphic artists and designers can create complex web page images. Sometimes,  parts of these images are better optimized as GIFs than as JPEGs, while other parts  of the images may be better optimized as JPEGs than as GIFs. By image slicing the  156  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  single, complex images into multiple, smaller images, you can optimize all portions  for the most efficient display. In addition, there may be times when you plan special  mouse rollover effects for parts of a large, complex image. In this case, parts of the  image need to be individually accessible to scripting languages, and so the image  needs to be sliced. When an image is sliced, it is broken into multiple graphic files.  Most graphics applications, such as Adobe Fireworks and Adobe Photoshop, have  features for image slicing that automatically create the HTML for you. Visit the text-  book’s website at http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter4.html for more infor-  mation on image slicing.  CSS Sprites  A modern technique to optimize the use of images on web pages is called CSS  Sprites. A sprite is an image file that contains multiple small graphics that are con-  figured as background images for various web page elements. The CSS background-  image , background-repeat , and background-position properties are used to  manipulate the placement of the image. Having just a single image saves download   time, because the browser needs to make only one http request for the combined  image instead of many requests for the individual smaller images. You’ll work with  CSS Sprites in Chapter 7 .  4.7  Sources and Guidelines for Graphics  Sources of Graphics  There are many ways to obtain graphics: You can create them using a graphics applica-  tion, download them from a website providing them for free, purchase and download  them from a graphics website, purchase a graphics collection on a DVD, take digital pho-  tographs, scan photographs, scan drawings, or hire a graphic designer to create graphics  for you. Popular graphic applications include Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Fireworks.  Popular free graphics applications include GIMP   http:  gimp.org  , Google’s Picasa    http:  picasa.google.com  , and the Pixlr web application   http:  pixlr.com editor  .  These applications usually include tutorials and sample images to help you get  started. Visit the textbook’s website at http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter4.html  for tutorials on using Adobe Fireworks and Adobe Photoshop to create a logo  Sometimes you might be tempted to right-click on an image on a web page and down-  load it for use on your own website. Be aware that materials on a website are copy-  righted  even if a copyright symbol or notice does not appear  and are not free to use  unless the owner of the site permits it. So, contact the owner of an image and request  permission for use rather than just taking it. If you’re using Flickr   http:  flickr.com   to search for images, select the advanced-search page and check “ Only search within  Creative Commons-licensed content .” Be sure to follow the instructions for attribution  There are many web sites that offer free and low-cost graphics.

Images  can also hurt your web page by slowing down its performance to a crawl and discouraging  visitors. This section explores some guidelines for using images on web pages.  Reuse Images  Once an image from your site is requested for a web page, it is stored in the cache on your  visitor’s hard drive. Subsequent requests for the image will use the file from the hard drive in-  stead of another download. This approach results in faster page loads for all pages that use  the image. It is recommended that you reuse common graphics such as logos and navigation  buttons on multiple pages instead of creating different versions of these common graphics.  Consider the Size vs. Quality Issue  You can choose among varying levels of image quality when using a graphics applica-  tion to create or optimize an image. There is a correlation between the quality of the  image and the size of the image file: The higher the quality, the larger the file size will  be. Choose the smallest file that gives you appropriate quality. You may need to experi-  ment until you get the right match.  Consider Image Load Time  Be careful when using images on web pages—it takes time for them to load. Optimize  the file size and the dimensions of images for efficient web page display.  158  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Use Appropriate Resolution  Web browsers display images at relatively low resolution —72ppi  pixels per inch  or  96ppi. Many digital cameras and scanners can create images with much higher resolu-  tion. Of course, higher resolution means larger file size. Even though the browser does  not display the depth of resolution, more bandwidth is still used for the large file size.  Be careful when taking digital photographs or scanning images. Use a resolution setting  appropriate for web pages. A one-inch image saved at 150ppi could appear close to two  inches wide on a 72ppi monitor.  Specify Dimensions  Always use accurate height and width attributes on image tags. This will allow the  browser to allocate the appropriate space on the web page for the image and load the  page faster. Do not try to resize the appearance of an image by modifying the settings of  the height and width attributes. While this approach will work, your page will load more  slowly, and your image quality may suffer. Instead, use a graphics application to create  a smaller or larger version of the graphic when needed.  Be Aware of Brightness and Contrast  Gamma refers to the brightness and contrast of the monitor display. Monitors used with   Macintosh and Windows operating systems use a different default gamma setting   Macintosh uses 1.8; Windows uses 2.2 . Images that have good contrast on a computer  running Windows may look slightly washed out on a Macintosh. Images created on a  Macintosh may look darker, with less contrast, when displayed on a computer with a  Windows operating system. Be aware that even monitors on the same operating system  may have slightly different gamma values than the default for the platform. A web devel-  oper cannot control gamma, but should be aware that images will look different on vari-  ous platforms because of this issue.  Accessibility and Visual Elements  Even though images help to create a compelling, interesting website, remember that  not all your visitors will be able to view your images. The Web Accessibility Initiative’s  WCAG 2.0 includes a number of guidelines for web developers in the use of color  Focus on  Accessibility  and images:  image tags.  tom of the page.  this is true.  ● Don’t rely on color alone.

The CSS3 background-clip Property  image with the following values:  The new CSS3 background-clip property confines the display of the background  ● content-box  clips the display to the area behind the content   ● padding-box  clips the display to the area behind the content and padding   ● border-box  default; clips the display to the area behind the content, padding,  and border; similar to the padding-box property except that the image will dis-  play behind a border configured to be transparent   The background-clip property is supported by modern browsers, al-  though Safari requires the proprietary -webkit-background - clip  property instead of the W3C draft background-clip property. Be  aware that when you code the nonstandard property, your CSS will not  pass W3C validation. Figure 4.26 shows a background image that is  configured to clip to the content box. The sample page is located in  the student files  chapter4 clip folder .  The CSS is shown as follows:  Figure 4.26 The CSS3  .test { background-image: url myislandback.jpg ;  background-clip property  -webkit-background-clip: content-box;  background-clip: content-box;  width: 400px;  padding: 20px;  border: 1px solid 000; }   The new CSS3 background-origin property positions the background image, using the  160  Property  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  The CSS3 background-origin  following values:  ● content-box  positions relative to the content area   ● padding-box  default; positions relative to the padding area   ● border-box  positions relative to the border area   Figure 4.27 shows a background image that is configured to  Figure 4.27 The CSS3  background-origin property  display in the lower right corner of the content box. The sample  page is located in the student files  chapter4 origin folder .  The CSS is shown as follows:  .test { background-image: url trilliumsolo.jpg ;  background-origin: content-box;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  background-position: right bottom;  width: 400px;  padding: 20px;  border: 1px solid 000; }  to the value “fixed”.  The CSS3 background-size  Property  You may have noticed that it’s common to use several CSS properties when configuring  background images. The properties typically work together. However, be aware that the  background-origin property has no effect if the background-attachment property is set  The new CSS3 background-size property can be used to resize or scale the back-  ground image. Valid values for the background-size property can be:  ● a pair of percentage values  width, height   ● a pair of pixel values  width, height   ● auto , contain , or cover  If only one numeric or percentage value is provided, the second value defaults to  auto . The value contain causes the background image to be scaled  with aspect  ratio intact  to vertically fill the container. The value cover causes the background   image to be scaled  with aspect ratio intact  to horizontally fill the container. In Figure  4.28  see the student files chapter4 size folder , the background image has been  configured to vertically fill the container using the following style rule:  div { background-image: url myislandback.jpg ;  background-size: cover;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  Figure 4.28 The CSS3  width: 200px;  background-size  property  padding: 20px; }  4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects  161  When using new CSS3 properties, be mindful that they are supported only in modern  browsers. Be sure to test without the CSS3 properties to verify that the pages are still  readable and usable. Visit http:  www.quirksmode.org css contents.html to get current  information about browser support of CSS3 properties.  CSS3 Multiple Background Images  Let’s explore applying multiple background images to a web page. Although the CSS3  Backgrounds and Borders module is still in working draft status, current versions of  most popular web browsers support the use of multiple background images.  Figure 4.29 shows a web page with two background images configured on the body  selector: a green gradient image that repeats across the entire browser viewport, and a  flower image that displays once in the right footer area. Use the CSS3 background prop-  erty to configure multiple background images. Each image declaration is separated by a  comma. You can optionally add property values to indicate the image’s position and  whether the image repeats. The background property uses a shorthand notation: Just  list the values that are needed for relevant properties such as background-position  and background-repeat .  Figure 4.29 The Firefox  browser displays multiple  background images  Progressive Enhancement  Multiple background images are currently supported by recent versions of Firefox, Chrome,   Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer 9. Be aware that multiple background images are not  supported by earlier versions of Internet Explorer. You’ll use the technique of progressive  enhancement , which is defined by web developer and HTML5 evangelist Christian  Heilmann as “starting with a baseline of usable functionality, then increasing the richness  of the user experience step by step by testing for support for enhancements before apply-  ing them.” In other words, start with a web page that displays well in most browsers and  then add new design techniques, such as multiple background images, in a way that  enhances the display for visitors who are using browsers that support the new technique.  To provide for progressive enhancement when using multiple background images, first  configure a separate background-image property with a single image  rendered by most  browsers  before the background property with multiple images  rendered by supporting  browsers and ignored by nonsupporting browsers . Figure 4.30 shows the page displayed  in Internet Explorer 8, which rendered the standard background-image property.  162  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Figure 4.30 Progressive enhancement in action. Although only one  background image displays, the web page has a similar display to  Figure 4.29  Hands-On Practice 4.8  Let’s practice confi guring multiple background images. In this Hands-On Practice you will  confi gure the body element selector to display multiple background images on the web  page. Obtain the trilliumgradient.png and the trilliumfoot.gif images from the student fi les  chapter4 starters folder. Save the images in your trilliumch4 folder. You’ll update the index.html  fi le from the previous Hands-On Practice. Launch a text editor, and open index.html.  1. Modify the style rule for the body element selector. Confi gure the background-image  property to display trilliumgradient.png. This style rule will be applied by browsers that do  not support multiple background images. Confi gure a background property to display  both the trilliumgradient.png image and the trilliumfoot.gif image. The trilliumfoot.gif image  should not repeat and should be displayed in the lower right corner. The body selector style  rules are as follows:  body { background-color: f4ffe4; color: 333333;   font-family: Arial; Verdana, sans-serif;  min-width: 700px;  background-image: url trilliumgradient.png ;  background: url trilliumfoot.gif  no-repeat bottom right,  url trilliumgradient.png ; }  2. Save your page as index.html. Launch a browser, and test your page. It will look different,  depending on which browser you use—similar to either Figure 4.29  in a browser that  supports multiple background images  or Figure 4.30  in a browser that does not support  multiple background images . Note : The W3C CSS validator currently defaults to CSS level  2.1, but the background property is part of CSS level 3  CSS3 . You need to choose the  appropriate CSS level when validating. Visit http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator and select  “CSS level 3” for the Profi le value.  3. There is usually more than one way to design a web page. Let’s consider the placement of  the fl ower image in the footer area of the web page. Why not confi gure the gradient image  4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects  163  as the body element selector background and the fl ower image as the footer background?  This confi guration will provide for a similar display on all currently popular browsers. Let’s try  this out. Edit the index.html fi le. Remove the background property from the body selector. A  Next, confi gure the trilliumfoot.gif image as the background for the footer selector. Confi gure  a height value that will be large enough to display the image. The code is  code sample is  body { background-color: f4ffe4; color: 333333;  background-image: url trilliumgradient.png ; }  footer { font-size: .75em; font-style: italic;  background-image: url trilliumfoot.gif ;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  background-position: right;  height: 90px; }  4. Save your page as index2.html. Launch a browser, and test your page. It should look similar  to Figure 4.29 on all popular modern browsers. See the chapter4 4.8 folder in the student  fi les for solutions to this Hands-On Practice.  CSS3 Rounded Corners  As you’ve worked with borders and the box model, you may have begun to notice a  lot of rectangles on your web pages! CSS3 introduces the border-radius property ,  VideoNote  Rounded Corners  with CSS  which can be used to create rounded corners and soften up those rectangles.  Valid values for the border-radius property include one to four numeric values   using pixel or em units  or percentages that configure the radius of the corner.  If a single value is provided, it configures all four corners. If four values are  provided the corners are configured in order of top left, top right, bottom right,  and bottom left. You can configure corners individually with the border-bottom-  left-radius , border-bottom-right-radius , border-top-left-radius ,   and border-top-right-radius properties.  There is a complication when configuring rounded corners, though. Developers of  browser-rendering engines, such as WebKit  used by Safari and Google Chrome  and  Gecko  used by Firefox and other Mozilla-based browsers , have created proprietary  properties to implement rounded corners. In addition, Internet Explorer 9 is the first  version of IE to support the border-radius property. So, you need to code three  different style declarations to round those corners:  ● -webkit-border-radius  for WebKit browsers   ● -moz-border-radius  for Gecko browsers   ● border-radius  W3C Draft Syntax   Eventually, all browsers will support CSS3 and the border-radius property, so code  this property last in the list. CSS declarations to set a border with rounded corners  are shown in the next segment of code. If you would like a visible border to display,  164  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  configure the border property. Then set the value of the three border-radius proper-  ties to a value below 20px for best results. For example:  border: 3px ridge 330000;  -webkit-border-radius: 15px;  -moz-border-radius: 15px;  border-radius: 15px;   See Figure 4.31  chapter4 box.html in the student files  for an example of this code in  action. With progressive enhancement in mind, note that your visitors using older  versions of Internet Explorer will see right-angle rather than rounded corners. However,  the functionality and usability of the web page will not be affected.  Figure 4.31  Rounded corners  were confi gured  with CSS  Be aware that when you code the nonstandard properties, your CSS will not pass W3C  validation. Also, keep in mind that another approach to getting a rounded look is to  create a rounded rectangle background image with a graphics application. However,  once CSS3 becomes a well-supported standard, the box model will be easy to “round  out” and is a much more efficient way to accomplish rounded corners.  Hands-On Practice 4.9  You’ll confi gure a logo header area that uses a background image and rounded borders in this  Hands-On Practice. When complete, your web page will look similar to the one shown in Figure 4.32 .  Figure 4.32 The web page with the logo area confi gured  1. Create a new folder called borderch4.

Launch a  browser to display the starter3.html web page shown in Figure 4.33 .  4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects  165  Figure 4.33 The  starter3.html fi le  2. Launch a text editor, and open the starter3.html fi le. Save the fi le as index.html. Edit the  embedded CSS, and add the following style declarations to the h1 selector that will confi gure  the  lighthouselogo.jpg  image  as  a  background  image  that  does  not  repeat:  height  set  to 100px,  width set to 700px, font size set to 3em, 150px of left padding, 30px of top padding, and a solid   dark-blue border  000033  with a border radius of 15px. The style declarations are as follows:  h1 { background-image: url lighthouselogo.jpg ;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  height: 100px; width: 700px; font-size: 3em;  padding-left: 150px; padding-top: 30px;  border: 1px solid 000033;  -webkit-border-radius: 15px;  -moz-border-radius: 15px;  border-radius: 15px; }  3. Save the fi le. When you test your index.html fi le in a browser, it should look similar to the one  shown in Figure 4.32 if you are using a browser that supports rounded corners. Otherwise  the logo will have right-angle corners, but the web page will still be usable. Compare your  work with the solution in the student fi les  chapter4 lighthouse index.html .  FAQ After I added the new properties, my CSS no longer passes W3C validation.  What should I do?  Because you are using the browser-proprietary properties - webkit-border-radius and  - moz-border-radius in addition to the CSS3 border-radius property, your CSS code will  not pass validation, but your pages will display in modern browsers with the visual aesthetic you  envisioned. In this case, it’s a deliberate decision to choose the visual display over the use of ab-  solutely correct syntax. In time, all browsers will support the border-radius property, you’ll be able  to remove the proprietary code, and your CSS will pass W3C CSS Level 3 validation testing. In the  meantime, if you are intentionally using nonstandard properties to enhance your web pages, don’t  worry when your CSS validation test generates errors related to those properties.  166  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  FAQ Why do some browsers use proprietary properties?  When adding early support for a CSS effect or proposed property, browser vendors  typically use a prefix to identify the property as a browser extension. As time goes by and  the W3C specification for the property becomes stable, the browser vendor will eventually  support the official property. Since CSS is rendered top down, a standard practice is to  code your style rules with the browser-specific properties listed before the W3C standard  property.  The CSS3 box-shadow Property  The CSS3 box-shadow property can be used to create a shadow effect on block-display  elements such as div and paragraph elements. The developers of the WebKit and Gecko  browser rendering engines have introduced proprietary properties for the box shadow  effect. You’ll need to code three style declarations to create a shadow and provide three  to five values for each:   ● Numeric pixel value for the shadow’s horizontal offset:  Positive value confi gures a shadow on the right. Negative value confi gures a  shadow on the left.  ● Numeric pixel value for the shadow’s vertical offset:  Positive value configures a shadow below. Negative value configures a  shadow above.  ● Optional: Numeric pixel value for the blur radius:  Higher values configure more blur for a softer shadow. 0 configures a sharp  ● Optional: Numeric pixel value for the spread distance:  Positive values cause the shadow to expand. Negative values cause the shadow  shadow.  to contract.  ● Valid color value  Here’s an example that configures a dark-gray drop shadow with 5px horizontal offset,  5px vertical offset, and a 5px blur radius:  -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 828282;  -moz-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 828282;  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 828282;  Eventually, all browsers will support CSS3 and the official box-shadow property, so  code this property last in the list. Note that when you include the nonstandard proper-  ties, your CSS will not pass W3C validation.  Include the optional inset value to configure an inner shadow. For example:  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 5px 5px 5px 828282;  -moz-box-shadow: inset 5px 5px 5px 828282;  box-shadow: inset 5px 5px 5px 828282;  4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects   167  The CSS3 text-shadow Property  The CSS3 text-shadow  property configures a shadow effect on text and is supported by  most recent versions of modern browsers, except for Internet Explorer 9. The property  requires four values:  ● Numeric pixel value for the shadow’s horizontal offset:  Positive value configures a shadow on the right. Negative value configures a  shadow on the left.  ● Numeric pixel value for the shadow’s vertical offset:  Positive value configures a shadow below. Negative value configures a shadow  below.  ● Numerical pixel value for the blur radius:  Higher values configure more blur. 0 configures a sharp shadow.  ● Valid color value  Here’s an example:  text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px 666;  Hands-On Practice 4.10  You’ll confi gure a centered content area and apply the text-shadow and box-shadow  properties in this Hands-On Practice. When complete, your web page will look similar to the one  Figure 4.34 The centered neutral background along with shadow properties add dimension  shown in Figure 4.34 .  168  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Create  a  new  folder  called  shadowch4.  Copy  the  lighthouselogo.jpg  and  the  background.jpg files  from the chapter4 starters folder to your shadowch4 folder. Launch a text editor, and open the  chapter4 lighthouse index.html  file   shown  in  Figure  4.32   .  Save  the  file  in  your  shadowch4 folder.  1. Confi gure the page content to be centered, with an 800-pixel width, a white background,  and some padding.  a. Edit the HTML. Confi gure a div element assigned to the id named container that wraps  the code within the body section. Code the opening   tag on a new line after the  opening body tag. Code a closing div tag on a new line before the closing body tag.  b. Edit the embedded CSS to confi gure a new selector, an id named container. Confi gure a  white background color and 20 pixels of padding. Recall from Chapter 3 the style  declarations that will center the page content. Use the width , margin-left , and  margin-right properties as follows:  container { background-color: ffffff;  padding: 20px;  width: 800px;  margin-right: auto;  margin-left: auto; }  confi gure a box shadow:  2. Edit the embedded CSS to add the following style declarations to the container selector to   -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 1e1e1e;  -moz-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 1e1e1e;  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 1e1e1e;  text shadow:  text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px 666;  shadow with no blur:  text-shadow: 1px 1px 0 ccc;  3. Add the following style declaration to the h1 element selector to confi gure a dark-gray  4. Add the following style declaration to the h2 element selector to confi gure a light-gray text  5. Save the fi le. When you test your index.html fi le in a browser, it should look similar to the one  shown in Figure 4.34 if you are using a browser that supports the box-shadow and  text-shadow properties. Otherwise the shadows will not display, but the web page will still  be usable. See the student fi les for a solution  chapter4 lighthouse shadow.html .  Browser support changes with each new browser version. There is no substitute for  thoroughly testing your web pages.  However, several resources provide support lists. The following websites provide this  information:  ● http:  westciv.com wiki Experimental_CSS_compatibility_table  ● http:  www.findmebyip.com litmus  ● http:  www.quirksmode.org css contents.html  ● http:  www.impressivewebs.com css3-click-chart  4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects  169  The CSS3 opacity  Property  The CSS3 opacity property configures the transparency of the background color.  Opacity values range from 0  which is completely transparent  to 1  which is completely   opaque and has no transparency . See Figure 4.35 for an example of using the opacity  property to configure a white background that is only 60% opaque.  Figure 4.35 The  background of  the h1 area is  transparent  Hands-On Practice 4.11  shown in Figure 4.35 .  In this Hands-On Practice you’ll work with the opacity property as you confi gure the web page  1. Create a new folder called opacitych4. Copy fall.jpg fi le from the chapter4 starters folder to your  opacitych4 folder. Launch a text editor and open the chapter2 template.html fi le. Save it in your  opacitych4 folder with the name index.html. Change the page title to “Fall Nature Hikes”.  2. Let’s create the structure of the web page with a div that contains an h1 element. Add the  following code to your web page in the body section:      Fall Nature Hikes      3. Now, add style tags to the head section, and confi gure the embedded CSS. You’ll create an id  named  content  to  display  the  fall.jpg  as  a  background  image  that  does  not  repeat.  The content  id also has a width of 640 pixels, a height of 480 pixels, left and right auto margins  which will  center the object in the browser viewport , and 20 pixels of top padding. The code is  content { background-image: url fall.jpg ;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;  width: 640px;  height: 480px;  padding-top: 20px;}  170   Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  4. Now configure the h1 element selector to have a white background color with opacity  set to 0.6, font size set to 4em, and 10 pixels of padding. Sample code is  h1 { background-color: FFFFFF;  opacity: 0.6;  font-size: 4em;  padding: 10px; }  5. Save the fi le. When you test your index.html fi le in a browser that supports opacity  such  as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer 9 , it should look similar to the page  shown in Figure 4.35 . See the student fi les for a solution  chapter4 opacity index.html . If  you look very carefully at the web page, you’ll see that the opacity property confi gured  both the background color and the text color of the h1 element to be partially transpar-  ent. The opacity property is inherited and would also affect any elements contained  within the h1 element. Experiment by changing the opacity property to different values,  and observe the results.  Figure 4.36 shows the web page displayed in Internet Explorer 8, which does not support the  opacity property. Notice that the visual aesthetic is not exactly the same, but the page is still  usable. While Internet Explorer 9 supports opacity, earlier versions support the proprietary  filter property with an opacity level configured between 1  transparent  and 100  opaque .  A sample is found in the student files  chapter4 opacity opacityie.html . The CSS for the filter  property is  filter: alpha opacity=60 ;  Figure 4.36 Internet Explorer 8 does not support the opacity  property and displays an opaque background color   4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects  171  CSS3 RGBA Color  CSS3 supports new syntax for the color property that configures transparent color,  called RGBA color . Four values are required: red color, green color, blue color, and alpha   transparency . RGBA color does not use hexadecimal color values. Instead, decimal  color values are configured; see the partial color chart in Figure 4.37 and the Web-Safe  Color Palette in the Appendix for examples.  Figure 4.37 Hexadecimal and RGB decimal color values  The values for red, green, and blue must be decimal values from 0 to 255. The alpha  value must be a number between 0  transparent  and 1  opaque . Figure 4.38 shows a  web page with the text configured to be slightly transparent.  Figure 4.38 CSS3 RGBA color confi gures the transparent text  172  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Hands-On Practice 4.12  In this Hands-On Practice you’ll confi gure transparent text as you code the web page shown in  Figure 4.38 .  1. Launch a text editor, and open the fi le you created in the previous Hands-On Practice  also  located  in  the  student  fi  les  chapter4 opacity index.html .  Save  the  fi  le  with  the  name rgba.html.  2. Delete the current style declarations for the h1 element selector. You will create new style  rules for the h1 selector to confi gure 10 pixels of right padding and right-aligned sans-serif  white text that is 70% opaque, with a font size of 5em. Since not all browsers support RBGA  color, you’ll confi gure the color property twice. The fi rst instance will be the standard color   value that is supported by all modern browsers; the second instance will confi gure the RGBA  color. Older browsers will not understand the RGBA color and will ignore it. Newer browsers  will “see” both of the color style declarations and will apply them in the order they are coded,  so the result will be transparent color. The CSS code is  h1 { color: ffffff;  color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;  font-size: 5em;  padding-right: 10px;  text-align: right; }  3 . Save the fi le. When you test your rgba.html fi le in a browser that supports RGBA color  such  as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer 9 , it should look similar to the page shown in  Figure 4.38 . See the student fi les for a solution  chapter4 opacity rgba.html . If you are using a  nonsupporting browser such as Internet Explorer 8  or earlier , you’ll see white text instead of  transparent text. While Internet Explorer 9 supports RGBA color, earlier versions support the  proprietary fi lter property; an example is in the student fi les  chapter4 opacity rbgaie.html .  FAQ What's HSLA color all about?  There is another new method to configure color when using CSS3, called HSLA color. The let-  ters in HSLA stand for hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha. It’s a different way of thinking  about color than the RGB system that web designers typically use. HSLA color is not yet sup-  ported on all browsers. Check out the following resources for more information:  ● http:  www.w3.org TR 2003 CR-css3-color-20030514 hsla-color  ●  http:  www.useragentman.com blog 2010 08 28 coding-colors-easily-using-css3-hsl-notation  ● http:  css-tricks.com yay-for-hsla  CSS3 Gradients  CSS3 provides a method to configure color as a gradient , which is a smooth blending of  shades from one color to another color. A CSS3 gradient background color is defined purely  with CSS; no image file is needed! This provides flexibility for web designers, along with a  savings in the bandwidth required to serve out gradient background image files.  4.8 CSS3 Visual Effects  173  Sound great? Yes, it does, but there is a catch: The WebKit and Gecko browser rendering   engines use a proprietary coding syntax to process CSS gradients. The W3C has added  gradient support to the CSS Image Value and Replaced Content Module  in draft status ,  but at the time this textbook was written, this syntax had not yet been adopted by  browsers. This section will provide an example of a CSS3 gradient, along with links to  resources for further study.  Figure 4.34 displays a web page with a JPG gradient background image that was config-  ured in a graphics application. The web page shown in Figure 4.39  available in the stu-  dent files chapter4 lighthouse gradient.html  does not use a JPG for the background;  CSS3 gradient properties re-created the look of the linear gradient image.  CSS3 Gradients and Progressive Enhancement  It’s very important to keep progressive enhancement in mind when using CSS3  gradients. Configure a “fallback” background-color property or background-image  property which will be rendered by browsers that do not support CSS3 gradients.  In Figure 4.39 the background color was configured to be same value as the ending  gradient color.  Figure 4.39 The gradient  in the background was  confi gured with CSS3  without an image fi le.  Configuring CSS3 Gradients  Code four style declarations to configure a gradient background:  ● -webkit-gradient  for Webkit browsers   ● -moz-linear-gradient  for Gecko browsers   ● filter  for Internet Explorer   ● linear-gradient  W3C draft syntax   Configure the gradient as the value of the background-image property  except for  Internet Explorer, which uses its filter property . The following CSS code first config-  ures a background color  for nonsupporting browsers  and then configures a linear gra-  dient that blends from white  FFFFFF  to a medium blue  8FA5CE :  174  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  background-color: 8FA5CE;  background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, left top, left bottom,  from FFFFFF , to 8FA5CE  ;  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient top, FFFFFF, 8FA5CE ;  fi lter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient   startColorstr=FFFFFFFF, endColorstr=FF8FA5CE ;  background-image: linear-gradient FFFFFF, 8FA5CE ;  WebKit Syntax  Examine the WebKit code syntax which is used by the Safari and Google Chrome brows-  ers. In its most basic form, the value of –webkit-gradient lists the type of gradient   linear or radial , starting point, ending point, starting color, and ending color.  Gecko Syntax  Review the Gecko code syntax which is used by browsers such as Firefox and Flock. The  value of –moz-linear-gradient lists the starting point and color-stops  in this case   there are two colors: FFFFFF and 8FA5CE .  Internet Explorer Syntax  Internet Explorer version 9 and below implements the filter property rather than the  background-image property . The color values are each eight characters long. The  first two characters indicate the alpha value  00 is transparent; FF is opaque . The  next six characters indicate the hexadecimal color value.  W3C Syntax  The W3C syntax uses different functions for linear   linear-gradient   and radial    radial-gradient   gradients. The basic format for a two-color linear gradient lists the  value for each color  in this example, FFFFFF and 8FA5CE .  As shown in the code samples, the syntax for configuring gradients varies by browser  engine. It is expected that eventually all browsers will support W3C linear-gradient  syntax, so code this declaration last in the list. Recall that the browser-proprietary CSS  syntax in this section is nonstandard. Your CSS code will not pass W3C validation when  you use these properties.

The number-one  reason  visitors  leave  web  pages  is  long  download  times.  When  using  images,  be  careful  to optimize the  images for the Web, reducing both the size of the fi le and the dimensions of the image, in order to minimize  download time.  You explored new HTML5 elements and many CSS properties in this chapter. When using the new CSS3  properties and HTML5 elements, be mindful of the concepts of progressive enhancement and accessibility.  Verify  that  the  pages  display  in  an  acceptable  manner  even  if  new  techniques  are  not supported by the  browser. Provide text alternatives to images with the alt attribute.

Use one of the following sites to determine the current browser sup-  port of the property, and include a summary of this information  along with the URLs  of the resources you used  in your web page:  ● http:  www.quirksmode.org css contents.html  ● http:  westciv.com wiki Experimental_CSS_compatibility_table  ● http:  www.findmebyip.com litmus  ● http:  www.impressivewebs.com css3-click-chart  Focus on Web Design  Visit a website that interests you. Print the home page or one other pertinent page  from the site. Write a one-page summary and reaction to the website you chose to  visit. Address the following topics:  a. What is the purpose of the site?  b. Who is the intended audience?   180  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  c. Do you believe the site reaches its audience?  d. Was this site useful to you? Why or why not?  e. List the colors and or graphics that are used on the home page of this website: back-  ground, backgrounds of page sections, text, logo, navigation buttons, and so on.  f. How does the use of color and graphics enhance the website?  WEBSITE CASE STUDY  Using Graphics & Visual Elements  Each of the case studies in this section continues throughout most of the text. In this  chapter, we add images to the websites, create a new page, and modify existing pages.  JavaJam Coffee House  See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the JavaJam Coff ee House Case Study. Figure 2.25  shows a site map for the JavaJam website. The Home page and Menu page were created in  earlier chapters. Using the existing website as a starting point, you will modify the design of  the pages and create a new page, the Music page. You have fi ve tasks in this case study:  1.  Create a new folder for this JavaJam case study, and obtain the starter image fi les.  2. Modify the Home page to display a logo image, a JPEG image, and a content div as  shown in Figure 4.40 .  3. Modify the Menu page to be consistent with the Home page.  4. Create a new Music page, as shown in Figure 4.41 .  5. Modify the style rules in the javajam.css fi le as needed.  Figure 4.40 New JavaJam Home page  Website Case Study  181  Hands-On Practice Case   Task 1: Create a folder on your hard drive or portable storage device called javajam4.  Copy all the fi les from your Chapter 3 javajamcss folder into the javajam4 folder. Obtain  the images used in this case study from the student fi les. The images are located in the  chapter4 casestudystarters javajam folder. The images are background.gif, greg.jpg,  gregthumb.jpg, javalogo.gif, melanie.jpg, melaniethumb.jpg, and windingroad.jpg. Save  them in your javajam4 folder.  Task 2: The Home Page. Launch a text editor, and open the index.html fi le from your  javajam4 folder. Modify the index.html fi le to look similar to the web page shown in  1. Replace the “JavaJam Coff ee House” text contained within the h1 element with the  javalogo.gif.

Hint : Use the special character ’ for the apostrophe character.  Save the music.html fi le. If you test your page in a browser, you’ll notice that it looks  diff erent from Figure 4.41 —you still need to confi gure style rules.  Task 5: Configure the CSS. Open javajam.css in a text editor. Edit the style rules  Website Case Study  183  as follows:  1.   Modify the body element selector style rules. Confi gure background.gif as the  background image.  2. Modify the style rules for the wrapper id. Confi gure the background color to be  ff ff cc. Confi gure a minimum width of 700px  use min-width  . Use the box-shadow  property to confi gure a drop-shadow eff ect.  3. Modify the h1 element selector. Remove the line-height style rule.  4. Add a new style rule for the h2 selector that confi gures a background color   ccaa66 , font size  1.2em , left padding  10px  and bottom padding  5px . The style  rules follow:  background-color: ccaa66;  font-size: 1.2em;  padding-left: 10px;  padding-bottom: 5px;  5. Modify the footer id. Confi gure 10 pixels of padding.  6. Add a new style rule for the id named content to confi gure 25 pixels of padding.  7. Add a new style rule for the class named details to add 20% left and right padding   use padding-left and padding-right  . Notice how this rule adds empty space on  either side of the music performance description and image.  8. Add a new style rule for the img element selector not to display a border.  Save the javajam.css fi le. Test your pages  index.html, menu.html, and music.html  in a  browser. If your images do not appear or your image links do not work, examine your work  carefully. Use Windows Explorer or Mac Finder to verify that the images are saved in your  javajam4 folder. Examine the src attribute on the   tags to be sure you spelled the  image names correctly. Another useful troubleshooting technique is to validate the HTML  and CSS code. See Chapters 2 and 3 for Hands-On Practice exercises that describe how to  use these validators.  Fish Creek Animal Hospital  See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the Fish Creek Animal Hospital Case Study. Figure  2.29 shows a site map for Fish Creek. The Home page and Services page were created in  earlier chapters. Using the existing website as a starting point, you will modify the  design of the pages and create a new page, the Ask the Vet page. You have fi ve tasks in  this case study:  1.  in Figure 4.42 .

Copy the nav div, and paste it inside the footer area  above the copyright line.    Refer to Figure 4.42 , and replace the main navigation text hyperlinks with image  links. The home.gif should link to index.html. The services.gif should link to  services.html. The askthevet.gif should link to askvet.html. The contact.gif should  link to contact.html. Use appropriate attributes on the   tag: alt, height, and  width. Assign the div that contains the main navigation to the id named main. The  div tag is coded as follows:     Save and test your new index.html page. It will be similar to Figure 4.42 , but you’ll notice  that a few fi nal touches  like the text shadow on the categories  are missing; you’ll confi g-  ure these with CSS in Task 5.   Website Case Study  185  Task 3: The Services Page. Launch a text editor, and open the services.html page from  your fi shcreek4 folder.

Be sure to include the alt, height, and width attributes on the    tag for the graphic.  2. Update the navigation area.  190  Chapter 4 Visual Elements and Graphics  Figure 4.46 Prime Properties Home page    Since you will be replacing the main navigation with image links, it’s a good idea  to provide for accessibility by including a set of text navigation links in the footer  section of the web page. Copy the navigation div, and paste it inside the footer  area above the copyright line.    Refer to Figure 4.46 , and replace the main navigation text hyperlinks with image  links. The navigation buttons use color as a visual cue for visitors. The navigation  button for the current page has a blue background. The navigation buttons for other  pages have a green background. To confi gure this area for the Home page, use  primehomebtn.gif  link to index.html , primelistingsnav.gif  link to listings.html ,  primefi nancingnav.gif  link to fi nancing.html , and primecontactnav.gif  link to  contact.html . Use appropriate attributes on the   tag: alt, height, and width.  Save and test your new index.html page. It will be similar to Figure 4.46 but you’ll notice  that a few fi nal touches  like the dark-blue page background  are missing; you’ll confi gure  these with CSS in Task 5.  Task 3: The Financing Page. Launch a text editor, and open the fi nancing.html page  from your prime4 folder. Replace the “Prime Properties” heading with the primelogo.gif.  Confi gure the navigation areas in a similar way as in the home page. In the top navigation,  use primehomenav.gif  link to index.html , primelistingsnav.gif  link to listings.html ,  primefi nancingbtn.gif  link to fi nancing.html , and primecontactnav.gif  link to contact.html .  Save and test your new fi nancing.html page.  Task  4:  The  Listings  Page. Use  the  Financing  page  as  the  starting  point  for  the  Listings page.   Launch a text editor, and open the fi nancing.html fi le in the prime4 folder. Save the fi le as  listings.html. Modify your fi le to look similar to the Listings page, as shown in Figure 4.47 .  1.  Change the title to an appropriate phrase.  2. Confi gure the top navigation area to display primehomenav.gif  link to index.html ,  primelistingsbtn.gif  link to listings.html , primefi nancingnav.gif  link to fi nancing.  html , and primecontactnav.gif  link to contact.html .

Confi gure an unordered list with the following text:  Close to train  Two bedrooms, two baths  Two indoor parking spaces  Listing 3432432  Save the listings.html fi le. If you test your page in a browser, you’ll notice that it looks  diff erent from Figure 4.47 ; you still need to confi gure style rules.  Task 5: Configure the CSS. Open pacifi c.css in in a text editor. Edit the style rules as  follows:    Modify the style rules for the body element selector to confi gure a very dark  background color  000033 . Choose either primevertical.png, primehorizontal.  png or primediagonal.png to use as the background image.    Modify the style rules for the wrapper id. Confi gure FFFFCC as the background  color. Confi gure a minimum width of 700px  use min-width  , no top padding, no  right padding, 20 pixels of bottom padding, 30 pixels of left padding, and a 1 pixel  blue  00332B  ridge border with rounded corners. Also confi gure an inset box  shadow with the following CSS:  -webkit-box-shadow: inset -3px -3px 3px 3px 00332B;  -moz-box-shadow: inset -3px -3px 3px 3px 00332B;  box-shadow: inset -3px -3px 3px 3px 00332B;    Modify the style rules for the h3 element selector to have 10 pixels of top padding.    The background properties on the header id selector, h2 element selector, and h3  element selector interfere with the inset box shadow in some browsers. Remove  the background-property style rule from these selectors.    Confi gure the img element selector to display no border.  Save the prime.css fi le. Test your pages  index.html, fi nancing.html, and listing.html  in a  browser. If your images do not appear or your image links do not function, examine your  work carefully. Use Windows Explorer or Mac Finder to verify that the images are saved in  your prime folder. Examine the src attributes on the   tags to be sure you spelled the  image names correctly. Another useful troubleshooting technique is to validate the HTML  and CSS code.

What separates the good from the bad? This chapter discusses  recommended web design practices. The topics include site organization,  navigation design, page layout design, text design, graphic design, and  accessibility considerations.  193   194  5.1  Chapter 5 Web Design  Design for Your Target Audience  Whatever your personal preferences, design your website to appeal to your target audience —  the people who will use your site. Your intended target audience may be specific, such as  kids, college students, young couples, or seniors, or you may intend your site to appeal to  everyone. The purpose and goals of your visitors will vary—they may be casually seeking  information, performing research for school or work, comparison shopping, job hunting, and  so on. The design of a website should appeal to and meet the needs of the target audience.  For  example,  NASA’s  website,  http:  www.nasa.gov  ,  as  shown  in Figure  5.1  ,  features compelling  graphics  and  has  a  different  look  and  feel  from  the  text-based,  link-intensive Bureau  of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index web page, http:  www.bls.gov cpi , in Figure 5.2 .  Figure 5.1  The compelling  graphic draws  you in  Figure 5.2  This text-intensive  web page offers  numerous choices   5.2 Website Organization  195  The first site engages you, draws you in, and invites exploration. The second site  provides you with a wide range of choices so that you can quickly get down to work.  The layout, navigation, and even the use of color and text can work together to appeal  to your target audience. Keep your target audience in mind as you explore the web  How will visitors move around your site? How will they find what they need? This is  largely determined by the website’s organization or architecture. There are three com-  design practices in this chapter.  5.2  Website Organization  mon types of website organization:  ● Hierarchical  ● Linear  ● Random  sometimes called Web organization   A diagram of the organization of a website is called a site map . Creating the site map is  one of the initial steps in developing a website  more on this in Chapter 10  .  Hierarchical Organization  Most websites use hierarchical organization . A site  map for hierarchical organization, such as the one  shown in Figure 5.3 , is characterized by a clearly  defined home page with links to major site sec-  tions. Web pages within sections are placed as  needed. The home page and the first level of pages  in a hierarchical site map typically indicate the  hyperlinks on the main navigation bar of each  web page.  Figure 5.3  It is important to be aware of the pitfalls of hierarchi-  Hierarchical site organization  cal organization. Figure 5.4 shows a site design  that is too shallow—there are too many major site sections.  This site design needs to be organized into fewer, easily managed topics or units of  information, a process called chunking . In the case of web page design, each unit  Figure 5.4 This site design uses a shallow hierarchy      http:  web.missouri.edu ~cowann   research.html   . Following  this  principle,  be  aware  of  the number of major navigation links and  196  Chapter 5 Web Design  of information is a page. Nelson Cowan, a research psychologist  at the University of Missouri, found that adults typically can  keep about four items or chunks of items  such as the three  parts of a phone number 888-555-5555  in their short-term memory  try to group them into visually separate sections on the page with  each group having no more than about four links.  Another pitfall is designing a site that is too deep. Figure 5.5 shows  an example of this. The interface design “three click rule” says that a  web page visitor should be able to get from any page on your site to  any other page on your site with a maximum of three hyperlinks. In  other words, a visitor who cannot get what they want in three mouse  clicks will begin to feel frustrated and may leave your site. This rule  may be very difficult to satisfy on a large site, but in general, the goal  is to organize your site so that your visitors can easily navigate from  Figure 5.5 This site design uses a deep   page to page within the site structure.  hierarchy  Linear Organization  Figure 5.6 , is useful.  Figure 5.6 Linear  site organization  When the purpose of a site or series of pages on a site is to provide a tutorial, tour, or  presentation that needs to be viewed sequentially, linear organization , as shown in  In linear organization, the pages are viewed one after another. Some  websites use hierarchical organization in general, but with linear  organization in a few small areas.  Random Organization  Random organization  sometimes called Web organization  offers no  clear path through the site, as shown in Figure 5.7 . There is often no clear  home page and no discernable structure. Random organization is not as  common as hierarchical or linear organization and is usually found only  Figure 5.7 Random site organization  on artistic sites or sites that strive to be especially different and original.  This type of organization is typically not used for commercial websites.  FAQ What’s a good way to build my site map?  Sometimes it is difficult to begin creating a site map for a website. Some design teams meet in  a room with a blank wall and a package of large Post-it® Notes. They write the titles of topics  and subtopics needed in the site on the Post-it® Notes. They arrange the notes on the wall and  discuss them until the site structure becomes clear and there is consensus within the group. If  you are not working in a group, you can try this on your own and then discuss the organization  of the website with a friend or fellow student.  5.4 Design to Provide Accessibility  197  5.3  Principles of Visual Design  There are four visual design principles that you can apply to the design of just about  anything: repetition, contrast, proximity, and alignment. Whether you are designing a  VideoNote  Principles of  Visual Design  web page, a button, a logo, a DVD cover, a brochure, or a software interface, the four  design principles will help to create the “look,” or visual aesthetic, of your project and  will determine whether your message is effectively communicated.  Repetition: Repeat Visual Elements  Throughout the Design   When applying the principle of repetition , the designer repeats one or more elements  throughout the product. The repeating aspect ties the work together. Whether it is color,  shape, font, or image, the repetition of elements helps to unify a design.  Contrast: Add Visual Excitement and Draw Attention  To apply the principle of contrast , the designer should make the elements very different   add contrast  in order to make the design interesting and to direct attention. When  designing web pages, there should be good contrast between the background color and  the text.  Proximity: Group Related Items  When designers apply the principle of proximity , related items are placed physically  close together. Unrelated items should have space separating them. The placing of  items close together gives visual clues to the logical organization of the information  or functionality.  Alignment: Align Elements to Create Visual Unity  Another principle that helps to create a cohesive web page is alignment . When applying this  principle, the designer organizes the page so that each element placed has some alignment   vertical or horizontal  with another element on the page.  Repetition, contrast, proximity, and alignment are four principles that can greatly  improve your web page designs. If you apply these principles effectively,  your web pages will look more professional and you will communicate your  message more clearly. Keep these visual design principles in mind as you design  In Chapter 1 , you were introduced to the concept of universal design . The Center for  Universal Design defines universal design as “the design of products and environments  to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adapta-  and build websites.  5.4  Design to Provide Accessibility  Focus on  Accessibility  tion or specialized design.”  198  Chapter 5 Web Design  Who Benefits from Universal Design  and Increased Accessibility?  Consider the following scenarios:  ● Maria, a young woman in her twenties with physical challenges who cannot   manipulate a mouse and who uses a keyboard with much effort: Accessible web  pages designed to function without a mouse will help Maria to access content.  ● Leotis, a college student who is deaf and wants to be a web developer: Captions  for audio video content and transcripts will provide Leotis access to content.  ● Jim, a middle-aged man who has a dial-up Internet connection and is using  the Web for personal enjoyment: Alternate text for images and transcripts for  multimedia will provide Jim improved access to content.  ● Nadine, a mature woman with age-related macular degeneration who has dif-  ficulty reading small print: Web pages that are designed so that text can be  enlarged in the browser will make it easier for Nadine to read.  ● Karen, a college student using a smartphone to access the Web: Accessible  content organized with headings and lists will make it easier for Karen to surf  the Web on a mobile device.  ● Prakesh, a man in his thirties who is legally blind and  needs access to the Web in order to do his job: Web  pages that are designed to be accessible  which are  organized with headings and lists, display descriptive  text for hyperlinks, provide alternate text descriptions  for images, and are usable without a mouse  will help  Prakesh to access content.  All of these individuals benefit from web pages that are  designed with accessibility in mind. A web page that is  designed to be accessible is typically more usable for  all—even a person who has no physical challenges and is  Figure 5.8 Everyone benefi ts from an accessible  using a broadband connection benefits from the improved  web page    Figure 5.8  .  presentation and organization of a well-designed web page  Accessible Design Can Benefit Search Engine Listing  Search engine programs  commonly referred to as bots or spiders  walk the Web and fol-  low hyperlinks on websites. An accessible website with descriptive page titles that is  well organized with headings, lists, descriptive text for hyperlinks, and alternate text for  images is more visible to search engine robots and may result in a better ranking.  Accessibility Is the Right Thing to Do  The Internet and the World Wide Web are such a pervasive part of our culture that  accessibility is mandated by law in the United States. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation  Act requires electronic and information technology, including web pages, used by  5.5 Writing for the Web  199  federal agencies to be accessible to people with disabilities. At the time this was  written, the Section 508 standards were undergoing revision; see  http:  www.access-board.gov for current information. The accessibility recommenda-  tions presented in this text are intended to satisfy the Section 508 standards and the  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0  WCAG 2.0  recommended by the W3C’s   Web Accessibility Initiative  WAI . The following four principles are essential to  conformance with WCAG 2.0: P erceivable, O perable, U nderstandable, and R obust,  referred to by the acronym POUR .  1. Content must be Perceivable . Perceivable content is easy to see or hear. Any  graphic or multimedia content should be available in a text format, such as text  descriptions for images, closed captions for videos, and transcripts for audio.  2. Interface components in the content must be Operable . Operable content has  navigation forms, or other interactive features that can be used or operated with  either a mouse or a keyboard. Multimedia content should be designed to avoid  flashing, which may cause a seizure.  3. Content and controls must be Understandable . Understandable content is easy  to read, organized in a consistent manner, and provides helpful error messages  when appropriate.  4. Content should be Robust enough to work with current and future user agents,  including assistive technologies. Robust content is written to follow W3C recom-  mendations and should be compatible with multiple operating systems, browsers,  and assistive technologies such as screen reader applications.  The WCAG 2.0 Quick Reference in Appendix E contains a brief list of guidelines for  designing accessible web pages. See http:  www.w3.org TR WCAG20 Overview for a  detailed description of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. These guidelines are segmented into  three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. In addition to satisfying  the Section 508 guidelines, the accessibility recommendations discussed in this textbook  are also intended to fully satisfy the WCAG 2.0 Level AA  includes Level A  guidelines and  partially satisfy the Level AAA guidelines. Visit http:  www.w3.org WAI WCAG20 quickref  for an interactive checklist of these guidelines. Developing accessible web pages  is an important aspect of web design. WebAIM has created a WCAG 2.0 checklist with  helpful tips at http:  webaim.org standards wcag checklist . The University of  Toronto   http:  achecker.ca checker index.php   provides a free accessibility validation service.  As you work through this book, you’ll learn to include accessibility features as you  create practice pages. You’ve already discovered the importance of the title tag, head-  ing tags, descriptive text for hyperlinks, and alternate text for images in Chapters 2 , 3 ,  and 4 . You’re well on your way to creating accessible web pages!  Long-winded sentences and explanations are often found in academic textbooks and  romance novels, but they really are not appropriate on a web page. Large blocks of text  and long paragraphs are difficult to read on the Web. The following suggestions will  help to increase the readability of your web pages.  5.5  Writing for the Web  200  Chapter 5 Web Design  Organize Your Content  According to web usability expert Jakob Neilsen, people don’t really read web pages;  they scan them. Organize the text content on your pages to be quickly scanned.  Be concise. Use headings, subheadings, brief paragraphs, and unordered lists to  organize web page content so that it is easy to read and visitors can quickly find what   they need.  Also be aware of line length—use white space and multiple columns if possible. Look  ahead to Figure 5.15 for examples of text placement on a web page. While it’s fine to  center headings and navigation areas, avoid centering all of your text—a paragraph of  centered text is more difficult to read than left-aligned text.  Text in Hyperlinks  Hyperlink key words or descriptive phrases; do not hyperlink entire sentences. Avoid  use of the words “Click here” in hyperlinks because users know what to do by now.  Also, be aware that an increasing number of people are using touch screens so they’ll  be selecting or tapping rather than clicking.  Reading Level  Match the reading level and style of writing to your target audience. Use vocabulary  that they will be comfortable with. Juicy Studio offers a free online readability test at  http:  juicystudio.com services readability.php .  Use Common Fonts  Use common font typefaces such as Arial, Verdana, Georgia, or Times New Roman.  Remember that the web page visitor must have the font installed on his or her  computer in order for that particular font to appear. Your page may look great  with Gill Sans Ultra Bold Condensed, but if your visitor doesn’t have the font, the  browser’s default font will be displayed. Explore the list of “browser safe fonts” at  http:  www.ampsoft.net webdesign-l WindowsMacFonts.html .  Font Size and Weight  Be aware that fonts display smaller on a Mac than on a PC. Even within the PC platform,  the default font size displayed by browsers may not be the same. Consider creating  prototype pages of your font size settings to test on a variety of browsers and screen  resolution settings. Bold or emphasize important text. However, be careful not to bold  everything—that has the same effect as bolding nothing.  Font Color Contrast  Use appropriate color combinations. Newbie web designers sometimes choose color  combinations for web pages that they would never dream of using in their wardrobe. An  easy way to choose colors that contrast well and look good together is to select colors  from an image or logo that you will use for your site.  5.6 Use of Color  201  Spelling and Grammar  Unfortunately, many websites contain misspelled words. Most web authoring tools such  as Adobe Dreamweaver have built-in spell checkers; consider using this feature. Finally,  be sure that you proofread and test your site thoroughly. It’s very helpful if you can find   web developer buddies—you check their sites and they check yours. It’s always easier  to see someone else’s mistake than your own.  5.6  Use of Color  Choosing Colors  You may be wondering how to select colors to display on web pages. One easy way to  choose colors is to use a monochromatic color scheme—all shades or tints of the same  color along with neutrals such as white, black, and or gray. Try the Color Blender at  http:  meyerweb.com eric tools color-blend to select colors for a monochromatic color scheme. Another way to create a color scheme is to base it on a photograph or image. If  you have a favorite color and would like to create a color scheme around it, visit one of  the following sites that suggest color schemes:  ● Colors on the Web: http:  colorsontheweb.com colorwizard.asp  ● Kuler: http:  kuler.adobe.com  ● Lee Street Management: http:  www.leestreet.com QuickColor.swf  ● Color Scheme Designer: http:  colorschemedesigner.com  ● ColorJack: http:  www.colorjack.com articles color_formulas.html  Accessibility and Color  While color can help you create a compelling web page, keep in mind that not all of  your visitors will see or be able to distinguish between colors. Some visitors will use a  screen reader and will not experience your colors, so your information must be clearly  conveyed even if the colors cannot be viewed.  Focus on  Accessibility  Your color choices can be crucial. For example, red text on a blue background, as shown  in Figure 5.9 , is usually difficult for everyone to read. Also avoid using a red and green  color scheme or a brown and purple color scheme because individuals with color-  deficient vision may have difficulty differentiating the colors. According to Vischeck    http:  www.vischeck.com vischeck  , about 1 out of 20 people experience some type of  color perception deficiency. Visit http:  www.vischeck.com vischeck vischeckURL.php  to simulate how a person with a color deficiency experiences the colors on a  web page. White, black, and shades of blue and yellow are easier for most people  to discern.  Figure 5.9  Some color  combinations are  diffi cult to read  202  Chapter 5 Web Design  Choose background and text colors with a high amount of contrast. The WCAG 2.0  guidelines recommend a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text. If the text has a large  font, the contrast ratio can be as low as 3:1. Jonathan Snook’s online Colour Contrast   Check  at  http:  snook.ca technical colour_contrast colour.html can  help  you  to  verify  the contrast level of your text and background colors.  See Lighthouse International’s website    http:  lighthouse.org accessibility design accessible-print-design effective-color-contrast    for more information on the effective use of color. When choosing color, it’s important to  consider the preferences of your target audience. The next sections focus on this aspect  of web design.  Colors and Your Target Audience  Choose colors that will appeal to your target audience. Younger audiences, such  as children and preteens, prefer bright, lively colors along with animation and  interactivity. Individuals in their late teens and early twenties generally prefer dark  background colors with occasional use of bright contrast, music, and dynamic  navigation. For an older target audience, light backgrounds, well-defined images, and  large text are appropriate.  If your goal is to appeal to everyone, follow the example of the popular Amazon.com  and eBay websites in their use of color. These sites use a neutral white background  with splashes of color to add interest and highlight page areas. Use of white as a  background color was also reported by Jakob Nielsen and Marie Tahir in Homepage  Usability: 5 0 Websites Decon structed , a book that includes analyses of 50 top websites.  According to this study, 84% of the sites used white as the background color and 72%  used black as the text color. This maximized the contrast between text and background,  providing maximum ease of reading.  You’ll also notice that websites targeting “everyone” often include compelling  visual graphics while providing the main content on a white background for  maximum contrast.

Describe the target audience for each site. How do their designs differ? Do the sites meet  203  3.  5.7  the needs of their target audiences?  Use of Graphics and Multimedia  As shown in Figure 5.1 , a compelling graphic can be an engaging element on a web  page. However, avoid relying on images to convey meaning. Some individuals may not  be able to see your images and multimedia—they may be accessing your site with a mo-  bile device or using an assistive technology such as a screen reader to visit your page.  You may need to include text descriptions of important concepts or key points that a  graphic image or multimedia file conveys. In this section, you’ll explore recommended  techniques for the use of graphics and multimedia on web pages.  File Size and Image Dimensions Matter  Keep both the file size and the dimensions of images as small as possible. Try to display  only exactly what is needed to get your point across. Use a graphic application to crop an  image or create a thumbnail image that links to a larger version of the image.  Antialiased Aliased Text in Media  Antialiasing introduces intermediate colors to smooth jagged  edges in digital images. Graphic applications such as Adobe  Photoshop and Adobe Fireworks can be used to create antiali-  ased text images. The graphic shown in Figure 5.10 was created  using antialiasing. Figure 5.11 displays an image created with-  Figure 5.10 Antialiased text  out antialiasing; notice the jagged edges.  Use Only Necessary Multimedia   Use animation and multimedia only if it will add value to your site. Don’t  include an animated GIF or a Flash animation  see Chapter 11   just because  you have one. Limit the use of animated items. Only use animation if it makes  the page more effective. Consider limiting how long an animation plays.  In general, younger audiences find animation more appealing than older  audiences. However, a well-done navigation animation or an animation  that describes a product or service could be appealing to almost any target  group. Adobe Flash is frequently used on the Web to add visual interest  and interactivity to web pages. You’ll configure a Flash animation on a web  Figure 5.11 This graphic was not  antialiased: The letter “A” has a  page in Chapter 11 .  jagged look  204  Chapter 5 Web Design  Provide Alternate Text  Focus on  Accessibility  As discussed in Chapter 4 , each image on your web page should be configured with  alternate text. Alternate text may be displayed by mobile devices, displayed briefly  when an image is slow to load, and displayed when a browser is  configured to not show images. Alternate text is also read aloud  when a person with a disability uses a screen reader to access your  website. In Figure 5.12 , the Firefox Web Developer extension was  used to display the alt text for an image on the National Park Service  website   http:  nps.gov  .  To satisfy accessibility requirements, also provide alternate text  equivalents for multimedia, such as video and audio. A text transcript  of an audio recording can be useful not only to those with hearing  challenges, but also to individuals who prefer to read when accessing   new information. In addition, the text transcript may be accessed by  a search engine and used when your site is categorized and indexed.  Captions help to provide accessibility for video files. See Chapter 11 for  more on accessibility and multimedia.  Figure 5.12 The alt  text is displayed  above the image  by the Firefox  5.8  Navigation Design  Web Developer  extension  Ease of Navigation  each page.  Navigation Bars  Sometimes web developers are so close to their sites that they can’t see the forest  for the trees. A new visitor will wander onto the site and not know what to click or  how to find the information he or she seeks. Clearly labeled navigation on each page  is helpful. For maximum usability, the navigation should be in the same location on  Clear navigation bars , either graphic or text based, make it obvious to website  users where they are and where they can go next. It’s quite common for site-wide  navigation to be located either in a horizontal navigation bar placed under the logo  or in a vertical navigation bar on the left side of the page. Less common is a vertical  navigation bar on the right side of the page because this area can be cut off at lower  screen resolutions.  Breadcrumb Navigation  Jakob Nielsen, a well-known usability and web design professional, favors what he calls  a breadcrumb trail for larger sites, which indicates the path of web pages a visitor has  viewed during the current session. A common design technique is to place the bread-  crumb trail navigation at the top of the main content area that indicates the pages the  visitor has viewed during a visit.  5.8 Navigation Design   Using Graphics for Navigation  205  Focus on  Accessibility  provide for accessibility:  Sometimes graphics are used instead of text to provide navigation. When image hyper-  links instead of text hyperlinks provide the main navigation for the site, two techniques  ● Each image element is configured with an alternate text description  see Chapter 4  .  ● The page is configured with text hyperlinks in the footer section.  Skip Repetitive Navigation  Provide a method to skip repetitive navigation links. It is easy for visitors without vision and  mobility challenges to scan a web page and quickly focus on the page content. However,  Focus on  Accessibility  long, repetitive navigation bars quickly become tedious to access when  utilizing a screen reader or a keyboard to visit a web page. Consider  adding a “Skip navigation” or “Skip to content” hyperlink before your  main navigation bar that links to a named fragment  see Chapter 7   at  the beginning of the content section of your page. Figure 5.13 presents  another way to implement the skip navigation feature. Although not  immediately visible in the browser, visitors using a screen reader or a  keyboard to tab through the page will immediately encounter the  “Skip to main content” hyperlink in the upper-left side of the U.S.  Figure 5.13 Press the tab key to access  the “Skip to content” link on the U.S.  Department of Transportation website  Dynamic Navigation  Department of Transportation web page   http:  www.dot.gov  .  In your experiences visiting websites you’ve probably encountered navigation  menus that display additional options when your mouse cursor moves over an item.  This is dynamic navigation, which provides a way to offer many choices to visitors  while at the same time avoid overwhelming them. Instead of showing all the navigation  links all the time, menu items are dynamically displayed  typically using a  combination of HTML and CSS  as appropriate. The additional items are made  available when a related top-level menu item has focus or is selected. Visit Dynamic  Drive  http:  www.dynamicdrive.com dynamicindex1  for sample code that you can  use to create dynamic navigation for your own web pages.  Site Map  Even with clear and consistent navigation, visitors sometimes may lose their way on  large websites. A site map provides an outline of the organization of the website with  hyperlinks to each major page. This can help visitors find another route to get to the in-  formation they seek, as shown in the Ready.gov website in Figure 5.14 .  Site Search Feature  Note the search feature in the upper-right corner of the web page in Figure 5.14 . This site  search feature helps visitors to find information that is not apparent from the navigation   or the site map.  206  Chapter 5 Web Design  Figure 5.14 This  large site offers a  site search feature  and a site map  to visitors  5.9  Page Layout Design  Wireframes and Page Layout  A wireframe is a sketch or blueprint of a web page that shows the structure  but not the  detailed design  of basic page elements such as the logo, navigation, content, and  footer. Wireframes are used as part of the design process to experiment with various  page layouts, develop the structure and navigation of the site, and provide a basis for  communication among project members. Note that the exact content  text, images, logo,  and navigation  does not need to be placed in the wireframe diagram. Figure 5.15  depicts a diagram of a web page with a logo, navigation area, content area  with head-  ings, subheadings, images, paragraphs, and unordered lists , and a footer area.  In Chapter 6 , you’ll learn how to use Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  to configure web   pages with multiple columns. Sometimes the page layout for the home page is different  from the page layout used for the content pages. Even when this is the case, a consistent  logo and color scheme will produce a more cohesive website.  Figure 5.15 This  wireframe page  layout uses images  and columns of  various widths  5.9 Page Layout Design  207  Page Layout Design Techniques  Now that you have been introduced to page layout, it’s time to consider three popular  techniques for web page layout design: ice, jello, and liquid.  Ice Design  The ice design technique is sometimes referred to as a solid or fixed design. The page  hugs the left margin and has a fixed width. Websites that use this technique include  Federal Student Aid website   http:  studentaid.ed.gov   and the League for Innovation in  the Community College website   http:  www.league.org  .  Jello Design  The jello design technique configures content that is centered and may be of a  fixed width or a percentage width, such as 80%. Regardless of the screen resolution,  the content is centered in the page with even margins on both sides. Websites  that use this technique include Public Broadcasting Service   http:  www.pbs.org  ,  Office Depot   http:  www.officedepot.com  , and the State of California   http:  www.ca.gov .  The liquid design technique results in a fluid web page with content that takes  up 100% of the browser window regardless of the screen resolution. There is no  empty margin on the left or right—the multicolumn content will flow to fill whatever  size of window is used to display it. A disadvantage of this page layout is that at high  screen resolutions the lines of text may extend quite far across the browser viewport  and become more difficult to read. Websites using this technique include Amazon.com    http:  www.amazon.com   and Moodle™   http:  moodle.org  .  Websites designed using ice, jello, and liquid techniques can be found throughout the  Web. Ice designs using a fixed-width layout give the web developer the most control  over the page configuration but result in pages with large empty areas when viewed at  higher screen resolutions. Liquid designs may become less readable when viewed at  high screen resolutions because the page stretches to fill a wider area than originally  intended by the developer. Jello designs are often used because the web pages are  typically most pleasing to view on a variety of screen resolutions.  Design for the Mobile Web  Access to the Web from cell phones, smartphones, and tablets makes it possible to  always be online. The research firm eMarketer   http:  emarketer.com   predicts signifi-  cant growth for mobile access to the Web, with a projected 134.3 million mobile Internet  users by 2013. With this growth in mind, it’s becoming more important to design web  pages that are accessible and usable for your mobile visitors.   There are a few schools of thought on the best way to accomplish this, including develop-  ing a new mobile site with a .mobi TLD  see Chapter 1 to review TLDs , creating a separate  website hosted within your current domain that is targeted for mobile users, and using  CSS to create a style sheet along with new CSS3 media queries to configure your current  website for display on mobile devices. You’ll practice using these CSS coding techniques  in Chapter 7 . Whichever method you choose to use, be mindful of the following considera-  tions when designing mobile websites.  208  Chapter 5 Web Design  ● Small screen size. Common mobile phone screen sizes include  320×240, 320×480, 480×800, and 640×960  Apple iPhone 4 . Even  on one of the large phones, that’s not a lot of pixels to work with!  ● Low bandwidth  slow connection speed . Although the use of faster  3G and 4G networks is becoming more widespread, many mobile users  experience slow connection speeds. Images usually take up quite a bit  of bandwidth on a typical website. Depending on the service plan, some  mobile web visitors may be paying per kilobyte. Be aware of this and  eliminate unnecessary images.  ● Font, color, and media issues. Mobile devices may have very limited  font support. Configure font size using ems or percentages. Include  generic font family names in your stylesheet. Mobile devices may have  very limited color support. Choose colors carefully to maximize contrast.  Many mobile devices do not support Adobe Flash media.  ● Awkward controls; limited processor and memory. While smartphones  with touch controls are becoming more popular, many mobile users will  not have access to mouse-like controls. Provide keyboard access to assist  Figure 5.16 A text-intensive  these users. Although mobile device processing speed and available  mobile site features hyperlinks to  memory are improving, they still cannot compare to the resources of a   frequently accessed information  desktop computer. While this won’t be an issue for the websites you cre-  ate for exercises in this textbook, be mindful of this issue in the future as  you continue to develop your skills and create web applications.  ● Functionality. Provide easy access to your website’s features with prominent  hyperlinks or a prominent search button. The mobile site for the White House    Figure 5.16   is quite text-intensive with links to featured content, a search  feature, and a prominent link to the regular  full  website.  5.10  Load Time  More Design Considerations  The last thing you want to happen is for your visitors to leave your page before it has  even finished loading! Make sure your pages load as quickly as possible. Web usability  expert Jakob Nielsen reports that visitors will often leave a page after waiting more  than 10 seconds. It takes just less than 9 seconds at 56Kbps for a browser to display a  web page and associated files of 60KB. It’s a good practice to try to limit the total file  size of a website’s home page and all of its associated images and media files to less  than 60KB. However, it’s common to go over this recommended limit for content pages  when you’re sure that your visitors will be interested enough to wait to see what your  site is presenting.  According to a recent study by the PEW Research Center’s Internet and American Life  Project, the percentage of U.S. Internet users with a broadband  cable, DSL, and so on   connection at home or at work is rising. Sixty-six percent of adult Americans have ac-  cess to broadband at home. Even with the trend of increasing bandwidth available to  your visitors, keep in mind that 34% of households do not have broadband Internet  access. Visit Pew Internet   http:  www.pewinternet.org   for the most up-to-date statis-  tics. The chart shown in Figure 5.17 compares file sizes and connection speed download  5.10 More Design Considerations  209  Figure 5.17 File size download times and Internet connection speeds  times, and was created using a File Transfer Time–Data Transfer Speed Calculator    http:  www.t1shopper.com tools calculate downloadcalculator.php  .  One method to help determine whether the load time of your page is acceptable is to view  the size of your website files in Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. Calculate the total file size   of your web page plus all of its associated images and media. If the total file size for a sin-  gle page and its associated files is more than 60KB and it is likely that your target audience  may not be using broadband access, take a closer look at your design. Consider whether  you really need to use all of the images to convey your message. The perceived load time is  the amount of time that a web page visitor is aware of waiting while your page is loading.  Because visitors often leave a website if a page takes too long to load, it is important to  shorten their perception of waiting. A common technique is to shorten the perceived load-  ing time by optimizing images, using CSS Sprites  see Chapter 7  , and breaking a long page  into multiple smaller pages. Popular web authoring tools such as Microsoft Expression Web  and Adobe Dreamweaver will calculate load time at various transmission speeds.  Above the Fold  Placing important information above the fold is a technique borrowed from the  newspaper industry. When newspapers are placed on counters and in vending machines  to be sold, the portion above the fold on the page is viewable. Publishers noticed that  more papers were sold when the most important, attention-getting information was  placed in this location. You may use this technique to attract visitors to your web  pages and to keep them there. At the most popular screen resolution of 1024×768,  the amount of screen viewable above the fold  after accounting for browser menus  and controls  is about 600 pixels. Avoid placing important information and navigation  on the far right side because this area may not be initially displayed by browsers at  This term white space is also borrowed from the publishing industry. Placing blank or  white space  because paper is usually white  in areas around blocks of text increases  the readability of the page. Placing white space around graphics helps them to stand  out. Allow for some blank space between blocks of text and images. How much is  adequate? It depends—experiment until the page is likely to look appealing to your  some screen resolutions.  White Space  210  Chapter 5 Web Design  target audience.  Avoid Horizontal Scrolling  In order to make it easy for visitors to view and use your web pages, avoid creating  pages that are too wide to be displayed in the browser window. These pages require the  user to scroll horizontally. Currently, the most popular screen resolution is 1024×768.  Cameron Moll   http:  www.cameronmoll.com archives 001220.html   suggests that the optimal web page width for display at 1024×768 screen resolution is  960 pixels. Be mindful that not all of your web page visitors will maximize their  browser viewport.  Browsers  Unless you are designing for an intranet within an organization, expect  your website to be visited using a wide variety of browsers. Just because your  web page looks great in your favorite browser doesn’t automatically mean  that all browsers will render it well. A recent survey by Net Market Share    http:  marketshare.hitslink.com browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&qpcustomd=0    indicates that while Microsoft Internet Explorer is still the most popular web browser,   the Firefox open-source browser and the Google Chrome browser have been gaining  ground. The survey reports that about 54% of website visitors use Internet Explorer   including versions 6 through 9 , 22% use Firefox, 13% use Google Chrome, 7% use  Safari, 2% use Opera, 1% use the Opera Mini mobile browser, and the remaining 1%  use a variety of browsers, including Blackberry, Playstation, and Konqueror.  Apply the principle of progressive enhancement . Design the site so that it looks good in  browsers commonly used by your target audience and then add enhancements with  CSS3 and or HTML5 for display in modern browsers. Always try to test your pages with  the most popular versions of browsers on desktop PC and Mac operating systems. At  the time of this writing, these are Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 4,  Google Chrome 11, and Safari. Many web page components, including default text size  and default margin size, are different among browsers, browser versions, and operating  systems. Also try to test your site on other types of devices such as tablets and smart-  phones. Opera offers free simulators for the Opera Mini mobile browser at  http:  www.opera.com mobile demo .  Screen Resolution  Your website visitors will use a variety of screen resolutions. A recent survey by Net  Market Share   http:  marketshare.hitslink.com report.aspx?qprid=17   reported the use  of more than 90 different screen resolutions, with the top four being 1024×768  with  19.6% , 1280×800  15% , 1366×768  13% , and 1280×1024  8% . A typical smartphone  screen resolution of 320×480 was in use by about 2% of web visitors. Mobile use will  vary with the purpose of the website, but it is expected to grow as the use of smart-  phones and tablets increases. Be aware that mobile devices have low screen resolution,  5.11 Web Design Best Practices Checklist  such as 240×320, 320×480, or 480×800. Popular tablet devices offer a higher screen  resolution: Apple iPad  1024×768 , Motorola Xoom  1280×800 , Samsun Galaxy Tab   1200×800 , and Blackberry Playbook  1024×600 . In Chapter 7 , you’ll explore CSS  media queries, which is a technique for configuring a web page to display well on  various screen resolutions.

Practice creating site maps for the following situations.  a. Doug Kowalski is a freelance photographer who specializes in nature photography.  He often gets contract work shooting photos for textbooks and journals. Doug would  like a website that showcases his talents and provides publishers with an easy way  to contact him. He would like a home page, a few pages with samples of his nature  photographs, and a contact page. Create a site map based on this scenario.  b. Mary Ruarez owns a business, named Just Throw Me, which sells handcrafted   specialty pillows. She currently sells at craft fairs and local gift shops, but would  like to expand her business to the Web. She would like a website with a home  page, a page that describes her products, a page for each of her seven pillow  216  Chapter 5 Web Design  styles, and an order page. She has been advised that because she is collecting  information from individuals, a page describing her privacy policy would be a  good idea. Create a site map based on this scenario.  c. Prakesh Khan owns a dog-grooming business named A Dog’s Life. He would like  a website that includes a home page, a page about grooming services, a page  with a map to his shop, a contact page, and a section that explains how to select  a good pet.

Describe your target audience by age, gender, socioeconomic characteristics, and    What opportunity or issue is your website addressing?  For example, your website might address the opportunity to provide information  about a topic to others or create an initial web presence for a company.    What type of content might be included in your website?  Describe the type of text, graphics, and media you will need for the website.    List the URLs for at least two related or similar websites found on the Web.  2. Web Project Site Map. Use the drawing feature of a word processing program, a  graphics application, or a paper and pencil to create a site map of your website that  shows the hierarchy of pages and relationships between pages.  3. Web Project Page Layout Design. Use the drawing feature of a word processing  program, a graphics application, or paper and pencil to create wireframe page  layouts for the home page and content pages of your site. Unless otherwise directed  by your instructor, use the style for page layout composition shown in Figure 5.15 .  Indicate where the logo, navigation, text, and images will be located. Do not worry  about exact wording or exact images.  6  Page Layout  Chapter Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to . . .  ● Describe and apply the CSS Box Model  ● Configure navigation in unordered lists and style  ● Add interactivity to hyperlinks with CSS pseudo-  with CSS  ● Configure margins with CSS  ● Configure float with CSS  classes  ● Configure relative and absolute positioning  ● Configure web pages with HTML5 structural  with CSS  elements, including section, header, hgroup,  ● Create two-column page layouts using CSS  nav, aside, and footer  You’ve already configured the centered page layout with CSS.  We’ll add to your toolbox of CSS page layout techniques in this chapter, starting  with the box model. You’ll explore floating and positioning elements with CSS.  You’ll be introduced to using CSS to add interactivity to hyperlinks with pseudo-  classes and use CSS to style navigation in unordered lists. You will practice  coding new HTML5 elements that structure web page content.   221  Chapter 6 Page Layout  222  6.1  The Box Model  known as the box model .  Figure 6.1 The CSS box model  Content  Each element in a document is considered to be a rectangular box. As shown in Figure 6.1 ,  this box consists of a content area surrounded by padding, a border, and margins. This is  The content area can consist of a combination of text and web page elements such as  images, paragraphs, headings, lists, and so on. The visible width of the element on a  web page is the total of the content width, the padding width, and the border width.  However, the width property only configures the actual width of the content; it does not  include any padding, border, or margin.  Padding  The padding area is between the content and the border. The default padding value is  zero. When the background of an element is configured, the background is applied to  both the padding and the content areas. Use the padding property to configure an  element’s padding  refer to Chapter 4  .  Border  The border area is between the padding and the margin. The default border has a value  of 0 and does not display. Use the border property to configure an element’s border   refer to Chapter 4  .  Margin  web page.  The margin determines the empty space between the element and any adjacent ele-  ments. The solid line in Figure 6.1 that contains the margin area does not display on a   6.1 The Box Model  223  The Margin Property  Use the margin property to configure margins on all sides of an element. The margin is  always transparent—the background color of the web page or parent element shows in  this area. Browsers have default margin values set for the web page document and for  certain elements such as paragraphs, headings, forms, and so on. Use the margin  property to override the default browser values.  To configure the size of the margin, use a numeric value  px or em . To eliminate the  margin, configure it to 0  with no unit . Use the value auto to indicate that the browser  should calculate the margin. In Chapters 3 and 4 , you used margin-left: auto; and  margin-right: auto; to configure a centered page layout.

Feel free to experiment  with the box model and the chapter6 box.html file.  6.2  Normal Flow  Browsers render your web page code line by line in the order it appears in the .html doc-  ument. This processing is called normal flow. Normal flow displays the elements on the   page in the order they appear in the web page source code.  Figures 6.3 and 6.4 each display two div elements that contain text content. Let’s take  a closer look. Figure 6.3 shows a screenshot of two div elements placed one after  another on a web page. In Figure 6.4 , the boxes are nested inside each other. In both  cases, the browser used normal flow  the default  and displayed the elements in the  order that they appeared in the source code. As you’ve worked through the exercises  in the previous chapters, you created web pages that the browser has rendered using  You’ll practice this a bit more in the next Hands-On Practice. Then, later in the chapter,  you’ll experiment with CSS positioning and float to configure the flow, or placement, of  normal flow.  elements on a web page.

The code is  Create a style rule for a class named div2 to configure a width and height of 100 pixels, white   background color, ridged border, 10 pixel margin, and 5 pixels of padding.

Practice with Normal Flow and Nested Elements  Launch a text editor and open your box1.html file. Save the file with the name box2.html.  Edit the code. Delete the content from the body section of the web page. Add the following  code to configure two div elements—one nested inside the other.  226  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Save the file. Launch a browser and test your page. It should look similar to the one shown in  Figure 6.4 . Notice how the browser renders the nested div elements: The second box is  nested inside the first box because it is coded inside the first div element in the web page  source code. This is an example of normal flow. The student files contain a sample solution   see chapter6 box2.html .  The examples in this Hands-On Practice happened to use two div elements. However, the box  model applies to block display HTML elements in general, not just to div elements. You will get  more practice using the box model in this chapter.  A Look Ahead: CSS Layout Properties  You’ve seen how normal flow causes the browser to render the elements in the order  that they appear in the HTML source code. When using CSS for page layout, there are  situations in which you will want to specify the location of an element on the page—  either the absolute pixel location, the location relative to where the element would  normally display, or floating on the page. The CSS properties that configure the   placement of elements on a web page are discussed in the following sections.  6.3  CSS Positioning  You’ve seen how normal flow causes the browser to render the elements in the order  that they appear in the HTML source code. When using CSS for page layout, there are  situations when you may want more control over the position of an element. This sec-  tion introduces relative and absolute positioning.  Relative Positioning  Use relative positioning to change the location of an element slightly, relative to where  it would otherwise appear with normal flow. Configure relative positioning with the  position: relative; property along with one or more of the following properties:  left , right , top , and bottom . Table 6.2 lists CSS position and offset properties.  Figure 6.5 shows a web page  see chapter6 relative.html in the student files  that uses  relative positioning along with the left property to configure the placement of an ele-  ment in relation to the normal flow. In this case, the container element is the body of  Figure 6.5 The paragraph is confi gured using relative positioning  the web page.  6.3 CSS Positioning  227  Table 6.2 CSS properties for relative and absolute position  Property  Value  Purpose  position  static  relative  absolute  fixed  scrolled  left  Default value; the element is rendered in normal flow  Configures the location of an element relative to where it  would otherwise render in normal flow  Configures the location of an element outside of normal  flow precisely in its container element  Configures the location of an element within the browser  viewport; the element does not move when the page is  The position of the element offset from the left side of  Numeric value or  percentage  the container element  right  Numeric value or  percentage  The position of the element offset from the right side of   The position of the element offset from the top of the  The position of the element offset from the bottom of  The result is that the content of the element is rendered as being offset or shifted 30  pixels from the left, where it would normally be placed at the browser’s left margin.

Absolute Positioning   This paragraph uses CSS relative positioning to be placed 30 pixels  Use absolute positioning to specify the precise location of an element outside of the nor-  mal flow in its container element. Configure absolute positioning with the position:  absolute; property along with one or more of the following offset properties: left ,  right , top , and bottom . See Table 6.2 for a list of CSS position and offset properties.  Figure 6.6 depicts a web page that configures a div element using absolute positioning  to display the content 200 pixels in from the left margin and 100 pixels down from the   top of its container element, which is the body of the document. The padding and  background-color properties configure the heading element. See the student files   chapter8 absolute.html  for an example.  228  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Figure 6.6 The  div element is  confi gured using  absolute positioning  content { position: absolute;  The CSS is  left: 200px;  top: 100px;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  width: 300px; }  h1 { background-color: cccccc;  padding: 5px;  color: 000000; }  The HTML source code is   Absolute Positioning       This paragraph is contained in a div which is 300 pixels wide and  uses CSS absolute positioning to be placed 200 pixels in from the left  and 100 pixels down from the top of the browser window.      When working with absolute positioning, it is important to be aware that elements not  absolutely positioned will be rendered using normal flow by the browser. Elements that  are absolutely positioned are rendered outside of normal flow. You’ll explore this  behavior in the next Hands-On Practice.  Hands-On Practice 6.2  Figure 6.7 shows screenshots of two web pages with similar HTML content. The web page in the  upper screenshot does not have any CSS applied. The web page in the lower screenshot uses  CSS to confi gure text, color, and the absolute position of a paragraph element. Launch a text  editor and open chapter6 starter2.html in the student fi les. When a browser renders the page, it  will use normal fl ow and display the HTML elements in the order in which they are coded:   ,    ,   , and   . Launch a browser and display the page to verify.

Assign the paragraph to the content class. Add class="content" to the opening  paragraph tag in the body of the web page.  Save the file. Launch a browser and test your page. It should look similar to the lower web page  shown in Figure 6.7 . The student files contain a sample solution  see chapter6 trillium.html . Note  that even though the unordered list is coded in the page after the paragraph, it’s displayed im-  mediately after the heading. This is because the paragraph is absolutely positioned   position:  absolute  . Browsers render absolutely positioned elements outside of normal flow.  Note: This Hands-On Practice used embedded CSS for ease of editing. However, for an actual website with  more than one page, the most effi cient solution is to use an external CSS fi le. See Chapter 3 if you’d like to review using external style sheets. You’ll use external style sheets later in this chapter.  6.4  CSS Float  Elements that seem to float on the right or left side of either the browser window or  another element are often configured using the float property. The browser renders  these elements using normal flow and then shifts them to either the right or left as far  as possible within their container  usually either the browser viewport or a div element .    Use float: right; to float the element on the right side of the container.    Use float: left; to float the element on the left side of the container.    Specify a width for a floated element unless the element already has an implicit  width, such as an img element.    Other elements and web page content will flow around the floated element.  Figure 6.8 shows a web page with an image configured  with float: right; to float on the right side of the  browser viewport  see chapter6 float.html in the student  files . When floating an image, the margin property is use-  ful to configure empty space between the image and text  on the page.  View Figure 6.8 and notice how the image stays on the  right side of the browser viewport. An id called yls  was created that applies the float , margin , and border  Figure 6.8 The image is confi gured to fl oat  properties. The attribute id="yls" was placed on the  image tag. The CSS is  h1 { background-color: A8C682;   padding: 5px;  color: 000000; }  p { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }  yls { fl oat: right;  margin: 0 0 5px 5px;  border: 1px solid 000000; }  The HTML source code is   Wildflowers   width="100">  <img id="yls" src="yls.jpg" alt="Yellow Lady Slipper" height="100"  6.4 CSS Float  231   The heading and paragraph follow normal fl ow.

Notice  the order of the images and paragraphs. Note that there is no CSS configuration for floating the  images. Display starter3.html in a browser. The browser renders the page using normal flow and  displays the HTML elements in the order they are coded.  Let’s add CSS to float the image. Save the file as floatyls.html in your ch6float folder. With  floatyls.html open in a text editor, modify the code as follows:   1. Add a style rule for a class name float that confi gures fl oat, margin, and border properties.  .float { float: left;  margin-right:  10px;  border: 3px ridge 000000; }  2. Assign the image element to the class named fl oat  use class="float"  .  Save the file as index.html. Launch a browser and test your page. It should look similar to the web  .  The  student   files  contain  a  sample  solution  page  shown   seechapter6 floatyls.html .  in  Figure  6.9   The Floated Element and Normal Flow  Take  a  moment  to  examine  your  file  in  a  browser   see  Figure  6.9     and  consider  how  the browser  rendered the page. The div element is configured with a light background color to demonstrate  how floated elements are rendered outside of normal flow. Observe that the image and the first  paragraph are contained within the div element. The h2 element follows the div. If all the ele-  ments were rendered using normal flow, the area with the light background color would contain  both child elements of the div: the image and the first paragraph. In addition, the h2 element  would be placed on its own line under the div element.  However, once the image is placed vertically on the page, it is floated outside of normal flow—  that’s why the light background color only appears behind the first paragraph and why the h2  element’s text begins immediately after the first paragraph and appears next to the floated  image. In the following sections, you’ll explore properties that can “clear” this float and improve  232  Chapter 6 Page Layout  the display.  6.5  CSS: Clearing a Float  The clear Property  The clear property is often used to terminate, or clear, a float. You can set the value of the  clear property to left , right , or both , depending on the type of float you need to clear.  Review Figure 6.9 and the code sample  see chapter6  floatyls.html in the student files .  Notice that although the div element contains both an image and the first paragraph,  the light background color of the div only displays behind the screen area occupied by  the first paragraph—it stops a bit earlier than expected. Clearing the float will help take  care of this display issue.  Clear a Float with a Line Break  A common technique to clear a float within a container element is to add a line break  element configured with the clear property. See chapter6 floatylsclear1.html in the stu-  dent files for an example. Observe that a CSS class is configured to clear the left float:  .clearleft { clear: left; }  Also, a line break tag assigned to the clearleft class is coded before the closing div  tag. The code for the div element is     <img class="fl oat" src="yls.jpg" alt="Yellow Lady Slipper"  height="100" width="100">    The Yellow Lady Slipper grows in wooded areas and blooms in June  each year. The fl ower is a member of the orchid family.         Figure 6.10 displays a screen shot of this page. Review Figure 6.9 and note two changes:  the light background color of the div element extends farther down the page and the h2  element’s text begins on its own line under the image.  Another Technique to Clear a Float  If you are not concerned about the light background color display, another option is to  omit the line break tag and, instead, apply the clearleft class to the h2 element,  which is the first block display element after the div. This does not change the display  of the light background color, but it does force the h2 element’s text to begin on its own  line, as shown in Figure 6.11  see chapter6 floatylsclear2.html in the student files .  6.5 CSS: Clearing a Float  233  Figure 6.10 The clear property is applied to a line  Figure 6.11 The clear property is applied to the h2  break tag  element  The overflow Property  The overflow property is often used to clear a float, although its intended purpose is  to configure how content should display if it is too large for the area allocated. See  Table 6.3 for a list of commonly used values for the overflow property.  Table 6.3 The overflow property   Value  Purpose  visible  hidden  auto  scroll  Clear a Float  Default value; the content is displayed, and if it’s too large, the content will overflow and  extend outside the area allocated to it  The content is clipped to fit the area allocated to the element in the browser viewport  The content fills the area allocated to it and, if needed, scrollbars are displayed to allow  access to the remaining content  The content is rendered in the area allocated to it and scrollbars are displayed  Review Figure 6.9 and the code sample  chapter6 floatyls.html in the student files .  Observe the div element, which contains the floated image and first paragraph on the  page. Notice that although the div element contains both an image and the first para-  graph, the light background color of the div element does not extend as far as expected;  it is only visible in the area occupied by the first paragraph. You can use the overflow  property assigned to the container element to resolve this display issue and clear the  float. In this case, we’ll apply the overflow and width properties to the div selector.  The CSS to configure the div in this manner is  div { background-color: F3F1BF;  overfl ow: auto;  width: 100%; }  This will clear the float. The web page will display as shown in Figure 6.12  see chapter6   floatylsoverflow.html in the student files .   234  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Figure 6.12 The overfl ow property is applied to the  Figure 6.13 The browser displays scrollbars  div selector  Notice that using the overflow property  see Figure 6.12   and applying the clear prop-  erty to a line break tag  see Figure 6.10   result in a similar web page display. You may be  wondering about which CSS property   clear or overflow   is the best one to use when  you need to clear a float.  Although the clear property is widely used, in this example, it is more efficient to apply  the overflow property to the container element  for example, a div element . This will  clear the float, avoid adding an extra line break tag, and ensure that the container ele-  ment expands to enclose the entire floated element. You’ll get more practice with the  float , clear , and overflow properties as you continue working through this textbook.  Floating elements is a key technique for designing multicolumn page layouts with CSS.  Configure Scrollbars  The web page in Figure 6.13 demonstrates the use of overflow: auto; to automati-  cally display scrollbars if the content exceeds the space allocated to it. In this case, the  div that contains the paragraph and the floated image was configured with a width of  See the example web page  chapter6 floatylsscroll.html in the student files . The CSS  300px and a height of 100px.  for the div is shown below:  div { background-color: F3F1BF;  overfl ow: scroll;  width:  300px;  height: 100px; }  Checkpoint 6.1  1.  2.

This can be accomplished with  CSS by configuring one of the columns to float on the web page. This section introduces  you to two formats for the two-column page layout.  Two Columns with Left Navigation  navigation.  The HTML template for the page layout is  See Figure 6.14 for a wireframe for a two-column web page. The left column will contain  Figure 6.14  Wireframe for a     two-column layout     with left navigation                     The web page in Figure 6.15 implements a two-column layout with the navigation on the  left  see chapter6 twocolumn1.html in the student files . The key to this layout is that  the left column is coded to float to the left with the float property. The browser renders  the other content on the page using normal flow.    The wrapper is centered and takes up 80% of the web page width. This area is  assigned a medium-blue background color that will display behind the left column:              wrapper { width: 80%;  margin-left:  auto;  auto;  margin-right:  Figure 6.15  A two-column  page layout with  left navigation  background-color: b3c7e6; }  236  Chapter 6 Page Layout    The left column is assigned a fixed width and configured to float to the left.  Because no background color is configured, the background color of the  container element  the wrapper div  displays:  leftcolumn { float: left;   width: 150px; }    The right column is assigned a margin on the left that is equal to or greater than  the width of the left column. This margin creates the look of two columns  often  called faux columns . A white background color is assigned to the right column,  which overrides the background color configured in the wrapper:  rightcolumn { margin-left: 155px;  background-color: ffffff; }  Two Columns with Top Header and Left Navigation  two columns with a navigation area in the left column.  The HTML template for the page layout is  See Figure 6.16 for a wireframe for a web page with that has a top logo header spanning                                      The web page shown in Figure 6.17 implements a two-column layout with a top header   see chapter6 twocolumn2.html in the student files . The CSS that configures the  Figure 6.16 Wireframe for a two-column  Figure 6.17 A two-column page layout with a top logo and  layout with a top logo area  left navigation  6.7 Hyperlinks in an Unordered List  237  the left and right columns.  FAQ Do I have to use a wrapper?  wrapper , leftcolumn , and rightcolumn areas is the same as for the web page shown  in Figure 6.15 . However, notice that the location of the div assigned to the header id is  different. It is now coded as the first div element within the wrapper and displays before  No, you are not required to use a wrapper or container for a web page layout. However, it  does make it easier to get the two-column look because the background color of the wrapper   div will display behind any of its child elements that do not have their own background color  configured. This technique also provides you with the option of configuring a different back-  ground color or background image for the page  as shown in Figure 6.17   using the body  element selector.  Not Yet Ready for Prime Time  There is one more aspect of the two-column layout web page design to consider before  it is ready for “prime time.” The navigation area is a list of hyperlinks. In order to more  closely semantically describe the navigation area, the hyperlinks should be configured  in an unordered list. In the next section, you’ll learn techniques to configure horizontal  and vertical navigation hyperlinks in unordered lists.  6.7  Hyperlinks in an Unordered List  One of the advantages of using CSS for page layout involves the use of semantically  correct code. Writing semantically correct code means choosing the markup tag that  most accurately reflects the purpose of the content. Using the various levels of heading  tags for content headings and subheadings or placing paragraphs of text within para-  graph tags  rather than using line breaks  are examples of writing semantically correct  code. This type of coding is a step in the direction of supporting the Semantic Web.  Leading Web developers such as Eric Meyer, Mark Newhouse, Jeffrey Zeldman, and  others have promoted the idea of using unordered lists to configure navigation menus.  After all, a navigation menu is a list of hyperlinks.  Configuring navigation with a list also helps to provide accessibility. Screen reader  applications offer easy keyboard access and verbal cues for information organized in  lists, such as the number of items in the list.  Focus on  Accessibility  Configure List Markers with CSS  Recall that the default display for an unordered list is to show a disc marker  often  referred to as a bullet  in front of each list item. The default display for an ordered list  is to show a decimal number in front of each list item. When you configure navigation  hyperlinks in an unordered list, you may not always want to see those list markers.  It’s easy to configure them with CSS. Use the list-style-type property to con-  figure the marker for an unordered or ordered list. See Table 6.4 for common property  values.

In Figure 6.20 , an image named trillium.gif was configured to  replace the list markers using the following CSS:  ul {list-style-image: url trillium.gif ; }  Figure 6.21 shows the navigation area of a web page  see chapter6 twocolumn3.html  in the student files  that uses an unordered list to organize the navigation links. The  6.7 Hyperlinks in an Unordered List  239  Vertical Navigation with an Unordered List  HTML is  Figure 6.21     Navigation in an  unordered list    Home      Menu      Directions       Contact       Configure with CSS  OK, so now that we’re semantically correct, how about improving the visual aesthetic?  Let’s use CSS to eliminate the list marker. We also need to make sure that our special  styles only apply to the unordered list in the navigation area  within the leftcolumn  id , so we’ll use a contextual selector. The CSS to configure the list in Figure 6.22 is  leftcolumn ul { list-style-type: none; }  Figure 6.22 The list  markers have been  eliminated with CSS  Remove the Underline with CSS  The text-decoration property modifies the display of text in the browser. This prop-  erty is most often used to eliminate the underline from the navigation hyperlinks with  text-decoration: none; .  The CSS to configure the list in Figure 6.23  see chapter6 twocolumn4.html in the  student files  that eliminates the underline on the hyperlinks in the navigation area   within the leftcolumn id  is  leftcolumn a { text-decoration: none; }  Horizontal Navigation with an Unordered List  Figure 6.23 The  CSS text-decoration  property has been  applied  You may be wondering how to use an unordered list for a horizontal navigation menu.  The answer is CSS! List items are block display elements. They need to be configured as  inline display elements to display in a single line. The CSS display property configures  how the browser renders, or displays, an element on a web page. See Table 6.5 for a list  of commonly used values.  Table 6.5 The display property  The element will not display  Value  Purpose  none  inline  block  240  and or elements  The element will display as an inline element in the same line as the surrounding text  The element will display as a block element with a margin above and below  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Figure 6.24 shows the navigation area of a web page  see  chapter6 navigation.html in the student files  with a hori-   zontal navigation area organized in an unordered list. The  Figure 6.24  HTML is  Navigation in an  unordered list          Home      Menu      Directions      Contact          Configure with CSS  The following CSS was applied in this example:  ● To eliminate the list marker, apply list-style-type: none; to the ul element  selector:  nav ul { list-style-type: none; }  inline; to the li element selector:  nav li { display: inline; }  ● To render the list items horizontally instead of vertically, apply display:  ● To eliminate the underline from the hyperlinks, apply text-decoration: none;  to the a element selector. Also, to add some space between the hyperlinks, apply  padding-right: 10px; to the a element selector:  nav a { text-decoration: none; padding-right: 10px; }  6.8  CSS Interactivity with Pseudo-Classes  Have you ever visited a website and found that the text hyperlinks changed color when  you moved the mouse pointer over them? Often, this is accomplished using a CSS  pseudo-class , which can be used to apply a special effect to a selector. The five pseudo-  VideoNote  Interactivity with  CSS pseudo-classes  classes that can be applied to the anchor element are shown in Table 6.6 .  Table 6.6 Commonly used CSS pseudo-classes  Pseudo-Class  When Applied  :link  :visited  :focus  :hover  Default state for a hyperlink that has not been clicked  visited   Default state for a visited hyperlink  Triggered when the hyperlink has keyboard focus  Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over the hyperlink   :active  Triggered when the hyperlink is actually clicked  6.8 CSS Interactivity with Pseudo-Classes  241  Notice the order in which the pseudo-classes are listed in Table 6.6 . Anchor element  pseudo-classes must be coded in this order  although it’s OK to omit one or more of  those listed . If you code the pseudo-classes in a different order, the styles will not be  reliably applied. It’s common practice to configure the :hover , :focus , and :active  pseudo-classes with the same styles.  To apply a pseudo-class, write it after the selector. The following code sample will  configure text hyperlinks to be red initially. The sample also uses the :hover pseudo-  class to configure the hyperlinks to change their appearance when the visitor places  the mouse pointer over them so that the underline disappears and  the color changes.  a:link { color: ff0000; }  a:hover { text-decoration: none;  color: 000066; }  Figure 6.25 shows part of a web page that uses a similar  technique. Note the position of the mouse pointer over the  Print This Page hyperlink. The text color has changed and has  Figure 6.25 Using the hover pseudo-  no underline. Most modern browsers support CSS pseudo-  class  classes.  Hands-On Practice 6.4   You will use pseudo-classes to create interactive hyperlinks in this Hands-On Practice. Create a  folder named ch6hover. Copy the lighthouseisland.jpg, lighthouselogo.jpg, and starter3.html fi les  from the chapter6 folder in the student fi les into your ch6hover folder. Display the web page in  a browser. It should look similar to Figure 6.26 . Notice that the navigation area needs to be  confi gured.  folder.  Launch a text editor and open starter3.html. Save the file as index.html in your ch6hover  Figure 6.26 The navigation area needs to be styled in this two-column page layout  Chapter 6 Page Layout  1. Review the code for this page, which uses a two-column layout. Examine the leftcolumn  id and modify the code to confi gure the navigation in an unordered list.  242          Home      Menu      Directions      Contact    Let’s add CSS to the embedded styles to confi gure the unordered list elements in the  leftcolumn id. Eliminate the list marker and set the padding to 10 pixels.  2. Next, confi gure basic interactivity with pseudo-classes.  ● Confi gure the anchor tags in the leftcolumn id to have 10 pixels of padding, use bold  leftcolumn ul { list-style-type: none;  padding: 10px; }  font, and display no underline.  leftcolumn a { text-decoration: none;  padding: 10px;  font-weight: bold; }  leftcolumn a:link { color: ffffff; }  leftcolumn a:visited { color: eaeaea; }  leftcolumn a:hover { color: 000066; }  ● Use pseudo-classes to confi gure anchor tags in the leftcolumn id to display white   ffffff  text for unvisited hyperlinks, light-gray  eaeaea  text for visited hyperlinks, and  dark-blue  000066  text when the mouse pointer hovers over hyperlinks:  Save your page and test in a browser. Move your mouse pointer over the navigation area and   notice the change in the text color. Your page should look similar to Figure 6.27  see chapter6   hover index.html in the student files .

Let’s reinforce these skills with a  Hands-On Practice.  Hands-On Practice 6.5  In this Hands-On  Practice,  you’ll  create  a  new  version  of  the  Lighthouse  Island  Bistro  home page  with a top header section spanning two columns, content in the left column, navigation in the  right column, and a footer section below the two columns. See Figure 6.28 for a wireframe. You  will confi gure the CSS in an external style sheet. Create a new folder named ch6practice. Copy  the starter4.html, lighthouseisland.jpg, and lighthouselogo.jpg fi les from the chapter6 folder in the  student fi les into your ch6practice folder.  Figure 6.28 Wireframe for a two-  column layout with a top header  area  1. Launch a text editor and open starter4.html. Save the fi le as index.html.

It takes a while to get used to it.  Fixing problems in code is called debugging . This term dates back to the early days of  programming when an insect  a bug  lodged inside the computer and caused a malfunc-  tion. Debugging CSS can be frustrating and requires patience. One of the biggest issues  is that even modern browsers implement CSS in slightly different ways. Browser support  changes with each new browser version. Testing is crucial. Expect your pages to look  slightly different in various browsers. Although Internet Explorer’s support of the CSS  standard is improving, there still are differences in compliance. The following are help-  ful techniques to use when your CSS isn’t behaving properly:  Verify Correct HTML Syntax  Invalid HTML code can cause issues with CSS. Use the W3C Markup Validation Service  at http:  validator.w3.org to verify the correct HTML syntax.  Verify Correct CSS Syntax  Sometimes a CSS style does not apply because of a syntax error. Use the W3C CSS Validation  Service at http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator to verify your CSS syntax. Carefully check your  code. Many times, the error is in the line above the style that is not correctly applied.  Configure Temporary Background Colors  Sometimes your code is valid but the page is not rendered in the way that you would ex-  pect. If you temporarily assign distinctive background colors such as red or yellow and  test again, it should be easier to see where the boxes are ending up.  Configure Temporary Borders  Similar to the temporary background colors, you could temporarily configure an element  with a 3 pixel red solid border. This will really jump out at you and help you recognize  the issue quickly.  Use Comments to Find the Unexpected Cascade   Style rules and HTML attributes configured farther down the page can override earlier style  rules. If your styles are misbehaving, try “commenting out”  see below  some styles and test  with a smaller group of statements. Then add the styles back in one by one to see where or  when the breakdown occurs. Work patiently and test the entire style sheet in this manner.  Browsers ignore code and text that is contained between comment markers. A CSS com-  ment begins with  * and ends with *  . The comment below is an example of documen-  tation that explains the purpose of a style rule.   * Set Page Margins to Zero *   body { margin: 0; }  Comments can span multiple lines. The comment on next page begins on the line above the  nav class and ends on the line below the nav class. This causes the browser to skip the nav  class when applying the style sheet. This technique can be useful for testing when you are  experimenting with a number of properties and may need to temporarily disable a style rule.  6.10 CSS Resources  247  *    * temporarily commented out during testing  .nav { text-decoration: none; }  A common mistake when using comments is to type the beginning  * without subse-  quently typing *  to end the comment. As a result, everything after the  * is treated as a  comment by the browser.  CSS Web Resources  This chapter introduces you to CSS for page layout configuration and should get you  started in your exploration of this technology. It may help you to know that you are not  alone in your quest to learn CSS. There are many resources with documentation, tutori-  als, and support for this technology.

Chapter 6 Page Layout  HTML5 Structural Elements  HTML5 introduces a number of semantic structural elements that you can use to config-  ure areas on a web page. These new block display elements are not intended to com-  pletely replace the div element, but are intended to be used along with div and other  elements to structure web page documents in a more meaningful manner that indicates  the purpose of the structural areas.  Standard HTML4 and XHTML coding practice is to use only one h1 element on a web  page and configure the heading-level elements in outline format. Outlining is differ-  ent in HTML5. Instead of a heading-level outline, the outline is also configured by  sectioning elements  such as section, article, nav, and aside  with heading levels  within each section. Try out an HTML5 outliner at http:  gsnedders.html5.org outliner .  We’ll explore the HTML5 header, hgroup, nav, footer, section, article, aside, and time  elements in this section. Let’s first take a closer look at the header, hgroup, nav, and  footer elements.  Header Element  The header element contains the headings of either a web page document or an area  in the document such as a section or article. The header element begins with the    tag and ends with the   tag. The header element is block display  and will typically contain one or more heading-level elements  h1 through h6  and,  optionally, the hgroup element.  Hgroup Element  The hgroup element groups heading-level tags and is useful if the logo header area  of a web page contains both the website name and a tagline  a phrase that  identifies and captures the essence of a business, e.g., the tagline of L. L. Bean  [ http:  www.llbean.com ] is “GUARANTEED TO LAST” . The hgroup element is block  display and begins with the   tag and ends with the   tag. When   there is more than one heading-level element in an hgroup, only the first heading  element is placed in the page outline.  Nav Element  The nav element contains a section of navigation hyperlinks. The block display nav ele-  ment begins with the   tag and ends with the   tag.  Footer Element  The footer element contains the footer content of a web page, section, article, para-  graph, or even the blockquote element. The block display footer element begins with  the   tag and ends with the   tag.  Remember that these new HTML5 elements are not supported by all browsers. However,  you can begin to practice with them today.  6.11 HTML5 Structural Elements  249  Hands-On Practice 6.6  In this Hands-On Practice, you’ll start with the two-column Lighthouse Island Bistro home page  from Hands-On Practice 6.5  shown in Figure 6.30   and modify it to use HTML5 structural  elements.  You’ll  also  add  a  tagline  to  the  header  area.  Create  a  new  folder  named ch6structure.  Copy the index.html, lighthouse.css, lighthouseisland.jpg, and lighthouselogo.jpg fi les from the  chapter6 practice folder in the student fi les and save them in your ch6structure folder.  1. Launch a text editor and open index.html. Replace the div assigned to the header id with  an HTML5 header element that contains an hgroup. Also add the tagline “the best coffee on  the coast” with an h2 element. The new code is   Lighthouse Island Bistro    the best coffee on the coast               element.  footer element.  2. Replace the opening and closing tags for the div assigned to the nav id with the HTML5 nav  3. Replace the opening and closing tags for the div assigned to the footer id with the HTML5  4. Recall that the HTML5 fi gure and fi gcaption elements were introduced in Chapter 4 . Code a  fi gure element that contains the image. Code a fi gcaption element that displays the text  “Island Lighthouse, Built in 1870” within the fi gure container below the image. Remove  id="floatright" from the image element. You’ll confi gure the entire fi gure element to  fl oat in step 9. The code is shown below:     <img src="lighthouseisland.jpg" width="250" height="355"  alt="Lighthouse Island">    Island Lighthouse, Built in 1870      5. Save the index.html fi le.  6. Open lighthouse.css in a text editor. Edit the CSS to use HTML element selectors for the  header, nav, and footer elements. Replace the header selector with the HTML header  element selector. Replace all instances of the nav selector with the HTML nav element  selector. Replace the footer selector with the HTML footer element selector.  7. Confi gure CSS for the h1 and h2 elements in the header. Use contextual HTML selectors.  Set the h1 bottom margin to 0. Set the h2 with 20 pixels of right padding; no margins; and  .80em italic, right-aligned, 00005D color text. The CSS is  header h1 { margin-bottom: 0; }  header h2 { margin: 0;  padding-right: 20px;  font-size: .80em;  font-style: italic;  text-align: right;  color: 00005D; }  250  Chapter 6 Page Layout  rule from the CSS.  8. Clean up some leftover CSS. Remove the floatright style rule and the h1 element style  9 . Confi  gure  the  style  rules  for  the  fi  gure  and  fi  gcaption  element  selectors.  The  fi  gure element  selector is set as follows: fl oat to the right, 260 pixels in width, and 10 pixel margin. The  fi gcaption element selector is set to render small, italic, centered text. The CSS is  figure { float: right;   fi gcaption { text-align: center;  width:  260px;  margin: 10px; }  font-size:  .80em;  font-style: italic; }  10. The most recent versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera support the  HTML5 elements that you have coded. But how can you help older browsers understand the  HTML5 code? One technique is to use CSS to confi gure the HTML5 element selectors as  block display elements. At the time that this was written, popular browsers  except Internet  Explorer 8 and earlier versions  correctly applied this style declaration. Add the following CSS:  header, nav, footer, figure, figcaption { display: block; }  11. Save your lighthouse.css fi le.  12. Display your index.html page in a modern browser. It should look similar to the page shown  in Figure 6.31  see chapter6 structure index.html in the student fi les .  Figure 6.31 HTML5 structural elements were used on this web page  6.11 HTML5 Structural Elements  251  As you completed the Hands-On Practice, you might have noticed that some of the id  names used for standard page areas, such as header , nav , and footer , were also the  names of new HTML5 structural elements. This is a great way to prepare for HTML5, even  if you are still coding XHTML! Become accustomed to the new HTML5 element names  by configuring divs with these names as id or class values. Then, later, when it’s time  to always code in HTML5 syntax, you’ve got a head start! The HTML5 Gallery at  http:  html5gallery.com contains  many  examples  of  how  HTML5  is  being  used  on  the  Web today. Next, we’ll explore the HTML5 section, article, aside, and time elements.  Section Element  The section element contains a “section” of a document, such as a chapter or topic.  The block display section element begins with the   tag and ends with the    tag. A section element might contain header, footer, article, aside, div,  and other elements needed to display the content. Section elements can contain other  section elements.  Article Element  to display the content.  Aside Element  The article element contains an independent entry, such as a blog posting, comment, or  e-zine article that could stand on its own. The block display article element begins with  the   tag and ends with the   tag. An article element is block dis-  play and might contain header, footer, section, aside, div, and other elements needed  The aside element is block display and contains a sidebar, a note, or other tangential con-   tent. The aside element begins with the   tag and ends with the   tag.  Time Element  The time element represents a date or a time and could be useful to date articles  or blog postings. The inline display time element begins with the   tag and ends  with the   tag. An optional datetime attribute can be used to specify a  calendar date and or time in machine-readable format. Use YYYY-MM-DD for a date.  Use a 24-hour clock and HH:MM for time. See HTML: The Markup Language at  http:  www.w3.org TR html-markup time.html for additional datetime syntax options.  Hands-On Practice 6.7  In this Hands-On Practice, you’ll begin with the HTML5 Lighthouse Island Bistro home page   shown in Figure 6.31   and modify the content to use a blog format that is structured with the new  HTML5 elements article, header, aside, and time. Create a new folder named ch6blog. Copy the  index.html, lighthouseisland.jpg, and lighthouselogo.jpg fi les from the chapter6 structure folder in  the student fi les into your ch6blog folder.  1. Launch a text editor and open index.html. Delete the text and elements contained within the  div assigned to the content id. Replace them with an HTML5 section element  assigned to  the content id  that contains an h1 element with “Bistro Blog” and two blog articles. Use  the section, article, header, aside, and time elements to create two blog postings for the  home page. Confi gure the new section as follows and save the fi le.  252  Chapter 6 Page Layout      Bistro Blog      whole wheat wrap.

Recall from Hands-On Practice 6.6 the CSS technique that helps older browsers to render  HTML5 elements as expected. Add the section, article, and aside HTML element selectors to  the CSS. The new style rule is  header, nav, footer, figure, figcaption, section, article, aside  { display: block; }  4. Save the lighthouse.css fi le. Display your index.html page in a modern browser. It should look  similar to the page shown in Figure 6.32  see chapter6 blog index.html in the student fi les .  Figure 6.32 The HTML5 section, article, and aside elements were used on this page  HTML5 and Today’s Browsers   Internet Explorer 9 and current versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera offer  good support of HTML5 structural elements. The issue is that many people still use  earlier versions of browsers. There are two different approaches that you can follow if  you’d like to begin using HTML5 today: a conservative, straightforward approach and  a progressive, enthusiastic approach that is more involved and requires JavaScript   see Chapter 11  .  Conservative Approach to Using HTML5 Today  For the best chance at compatibility, code using either HTML5 or XHTML syntax and  avoid using the new HTML5 elements. Instead, use the new element names as class names  or id names. In this way, you’ll become acquainted with the new element names and  it will be easier to update the pages to all HTML5 later on. See chapter6 blog all.html  for an example of this technique. As time goes by and older browsers are used less and  less, you’ll be all set!  254  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Progressive Approach to Using HTML5 Today  For starters, use Hands-On Practice 6.6 and 6.7 as an example: Code using the new  HTML5 elements and include CSS that configures older non-supporting browsers to  render the HTML5 header, figure, figcaption, footer, nav, section, article, and aside ele-  ments as block display  use display: block;  . This will work well in all browsers ex-  cept for Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions.  So, what to do about Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions? Remy Sharp offers a  solution to enhance the support of Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions  see  http:  remysharp.com 2009 01 07 html5-enabling-script  .  The  technique  uses  conditional comments that are only supported by Internet Explorer and are ignored by other  browsers. The conditional comments cause Internet Explorer to interpret JavaScript  statements that configure it to recognize and process CSS for the new HTML5 element  selectors. Sharp has uploaded the script to Google’s code project and has made it  available for anyone to use. Add the following code to the head section of a web page  after CSS to cause Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions to correctly render your  http:  html5shim.googlecode.com svn trunk html5.js  HTML5 code:     <script src="  ">        What’s the drawback to this approach? Be aware that your web page visitors using  Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions may see a warning message and must have  JavaScript enabled for this method to work. Try out an example  see chapter6 blog   today.html in the student files .   Why should you use HTML5 structural elements instead of div elements for some page  Checkpoint 6.3  areas?  1.  2.  3.

Modify the web  page to use external rather than embedded CSS. Save the file as hobby.css.   Web Research  This chapter introduced using CSS to confi gure web page layout. Use the resources  listed in the textbook as a starting point. You can also use a search engine to search  for CSS resources. Create a web page that provides a list of at least fi ve CSS resources  on the Web. For each CSS resource, provide the URL  confi gured as a hyperlink , the  name of the website, a brief description, and a rating that indicates how helpful it is to  beginning web developers.  260  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Focus on Web Design  There is still much for you to learn about CSS. A great place to learn about web technology  is on the Web itself. Use a search engine to search for CSS page layout tutorials. Choose a  tutorial that is easy to read. Select a section that discusses a CSS technique that was not  covered in this chapter. Create a web page that uses this new technique. Consider how  the suggested page layout follows  or does not follow  principles of design such as con-  trast, repetition, alignment, and proximity  see Chapter 5  . The web page should provide  the URL of your tutorial  confi gured as a hyperlink , the name of the website, a descrip-  tion of the new technique you discovered, and a discussion of how the technique follows   or does not follow  principles of design.  WEBSITE CASE STUDY  Implementing a CSS Two-Column  Page Layout  Each of the following case studies continues throughout most of the textbook. This  chapter implements a CSS two-column page layout in the websites.  JavaJam Coffee House  See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the JavaJam Coff ee House case study. Figure 2.25  shows a site map for the JavaJam. In this case study, you will implement a new two-col-  umn CSS page layout for JavaJam. Figure 6.33 shows a wireframe for a two-column page  layout with wrapper, header, left column, right column, fl oating, and footer areas.  Figure 6.33 Wireframe for a   two-column page layout for the  JavaJam website  this case study:  1.  You will modify the external style sheet and the Home, Menu, and Music pages. Use the  Chapter 4 JavaJam website as a starting point for this case study. You have fi ve tasks in  Create a new folder for this JavaJam case study.  2. Modify the style rules in the javajam.css fi le to confi gure a two-column page layout,  as shown in Figure 6.33 .  Website Case Study  261  Figure 6.34 .  Figure 6.34 The new JavaJam two-column layout  index.html   3. Modify the Home page to implement the two-column page layout, as shown in  4. Modify the Menu page to be consistent with the Home page.  5. Modify the Music page   Figure 6.35   to be consistent with the Home page.  Hands-On Practice Case  Task 1: Create a Folder. Create a folder called javajam6. Copy all of the fi les from your  Chapter 4 javajam4 folder into the javajam6 folder. You will modify the javajam.css fi le and  each web page fi le  index.html, menu.html, and music.html  to implement the two-column  page layout shown in Figure 6.33 . See the new JavaJam Home page, as shown in Figure 6.34 .  Task 2: Configure the CSS. Open javajam.css in a text editor. Edit the style rules as follows:  1.  Confi gure the header area. Create a new id named header with a background   ccaa66  and text  000000  color, center alignment   text-align: center;  , and  no margin   margin: 0;  . Remove the h1 element selector and style rules.  2. Confi gure the left-column navigation area. Add style rules to the nav id to confi gure  an area that fl oats to the left, is 100 pixels wide, displays centered text, and has 10  pixels of padding on the top.  3. Confi gure the navigation hyperlinks. Use a contextual selector to add a new style rule  for the anchor tags within the nav id. Confi gure this selector with 15 pixels of bottom  padding and no underline on hyperlinks.  nav a { text-decoration: none;   padding-bottom: 15px; }  4. Confi gure the :link , :visted , and :hover pseudo-classes for the navigation  hyperlinks. Use the following text colors: 996633  unvisited hyperlinks , ccaa66   visited hyperlinks , and 330000  hyperlinks with :hover  . For example,  nav a:link { color: 996633; }  262  Chapter 6 Page Layout  list markers.  nav ul { list-style-type: none; }  5. You will organize the navigation hyperlinks within an unordered list in later tasks.  The navigation area in Figure 6.33 does not show list markers. Use a contextual  selector to confi gure unordered lists in the navigation area to display without  6. Modify the content id style rules for the right column. Change the padding to 10  pixels top, 30 pixels bottom, 20 pixels left, and 20 pixels right. Confi gure a 150 pixel  left margin, background  f2eab7  color, and text  000000  color.  7. Confi gure an area that fl oats to the right. Notice how the winding road graphic  shown in Figure 6.33 fl oats on the right side—this is confi gured with the  floatright class. Images are more compelling when they are separated from  other elements  such as text  by empty space. Add 20 pixels of padding to the left  side of this area.  8. Modify the footer id style rules. Change the padding to 20 pixels top and bottom.  Confi gure the footer to clear all fl oats.  9. Confi gure the :link , :visited , and :hover pseudo-classes for the footer hyperlink.  Use the following text colors: ff ff cc  unvisited hyperlink , f2eab7  visited hyperlink ,  and 330000  hyperlink with :hover  .  10. Modify the h2 element selector style rules. View the Music page shown in Figure 6.35  and notice that the   tags are styled diff erently, with all uppercase text  using a  new property, text-transform   and diff erent background and text colors, font size,  bottom border, padding, and margin. Also confi gure styles to clear fl oats on the left.  Replace the h2 element selector style rules with the following:  h2 { text-transform: uppercase;  background-color: ffffcc;  color: 663300;  font-size: 1.2em;  border-bottom: 1px solid 000000;  padding: 5px 0 0 5px;  margin-right: 20px;  clear: left; }  11. Refer to the Music page shown in Figure 6.35 and notice how the images fl oat on the  left side of the paragraph description. Confi gure a new class named floatleft that  fl oats to the left with 20 pixels of right and bottom padding.  12. Confi gure a new class named clear that clears the left fl oat.  Save the javajam.css fi le.  Task 3: The Home Page. Open index.html in a text editor. Edit the code as follows:  1.   Confi gure the header area. Assign the   element to the header id.  2. Confi gure the left-column navigation area, which is the div assigned to the  nav id. Remove any   characters that may be present. Code an unordered  Website Case Study  263  within   tags.  road image element.  list to organize the navigation hyperlinks. Each hyperlink should be contained  3. Confi gure the image that fl oats to the right. Modify the winding road image element.  Remove the align="right" attribute and add class="floatright" to the winding  Save the index.html fi le. It should look similar to the web page shown in Figure 6.34 .  Remember that validating your HTML and CSS can help you fi nd syntax errors. Test and  correct this page before you continue.  Task 4: The Menu Page. Open menu.html in a text editor. Confi gure the header area,  left-column navigation area, and navigation hyperlinks in the same manner as the home  page. Save your new menu.html page and test it in a browser. Use the CSS and HTML  validators to help you fi nd syntax errors.  Figure 6.35 The new JavaJam Music page  Task 5: The Music Page. Open music.html in a text editor. Confi gure the header area,  left-column navigation area, and navigation hyperlinks in the same manner as the  home page.  1.  clearleft class.  Confi gure the thumbnail images to fl oat to the left. Add class="floatleft" to the  image tag for each thumbnail image.  2. Add a blank line above the closing div tag for the content id. Clear the last  fl oated thumbnail image by coding a line break tag that is assigned to the  Save your new menu.html page and test it in a browser. Use the CSS and XHTML validators   to help you fi nd syntax errors.  264  Chapter 6 Page Layout  In this case study, you changed the page layout of the JavaJam website. Notice that with  just a few changes in the CSS and HTML code, you confi gured a two-column page layout.  OPTIONAL: JavaJam Case Study: HTML5 Extension  Get more practice with the new HTML5 structural elements by creating a new version of  the JavaJam website. Create a folder called javajam6HTML5 to contain your JavaJam  website fi les. Copy the fi les from the javajam6 folder.  1.  Modify the javajam.css fi le in a text editor. Confi gure new styles and use HTML  element selectors for the header, nav, and footer elements.    All style declarations previously associated with the header id will apply to the  header element selector. Replace the header id with the header element selector.    Confi gure an h1 element selector with a zero margin.    Replace all instances of the nav selector with the nav element selector.    Replace all instances of the footer selector with the footer element selector.    Modify the details class. Confi gure 35 pixels of bottom padding.    Add the following CSS to be compatible with most older browsers:  header, nav, figure, footer { display: block; }  2. Modify each web page in a text editor. Confi gure HTML5 elements.    Confi gure an HTML5 header element to contain the h1 element. Remove    Replace the opening and closing tags for the div assigned to the nav id with the    Replace the opening and closing tags for the div assigned to the footer id with  id="header" from the h1 tag.  HTML5 nav element.  the HTML5 footer element.    Note the image on the home page. Use the HTML5 fi gure element to contain the  image element. Confi gure the fi gure element to use the floatright class.  Remove the floatright class from the image tag.    Note the image links on the Music page. Use the HTML5 fi gure element to contain  each image link. Confi gure the fi gure element to use the floatleft class. Remove  the floatleft class from the image tags. Also replace the paragraph tags  assigned to the details class with div tags assigned to the details class.    Add the following code in the head section of the web page after the link element  to assist Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions :  http:  html5shim.googlecode.com svn trunk html5.js     <script src="  ">        Save your fi les. Display your pages in a modern browser. Your new case study web pages  should look similar to the previous version. This optional exercise provided you with  additional practice using new HTML5 elements.   See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the Fish Creek Animal Hospital case study.  Figure 2.29 shows a site map for Fish Creek. In this case study, you will implement a  redesign with a new two-column CSS page layout. Figure 6.36 displays a wireframe for  a two-column page layout with wrapper, logo header, left column, right column, and  Website Case Study  265  Fish Creek Animal Hospital  footer areas.  Figure 6.36 Wireframe for a two-  column page layout for the Fish  Creek website  You will modify the external style sheet and the Home, Services, and Ask the Vet pages.  Use the Chapter 4 Fish Creek website as a starting point for this case study. You have fi ve  tasks in this case study:  1.  as shown in Figure 6.36 .  Figure 6.37 .

Modify the Home page to implement the two-column page layout, as shown in  4. Modify the Services page to be consistent with the Home page.  5. Modify the Ask the Vet page to be consistent with the Home page.  Hands-On Practice Case  Task 1: Create a Folder. Create a folder called fi shcreek6. Copy all of the fi les from your  Chapter 4 fi shcreek4 folder  except the fi sh navigation images home.gif, services.gif,  askvet.gif, and contact.gif  into the fi shcreek6 folder. You will modify the fi shcreek.css  fi le and each web page fi le  index.html, services.html, and askvet.html  to implement the  two-column page layout, as shown in Figure 6.36 . See the new Fish Creek home page, as  Task 2: Configure the CSS. Open fi shcreek.css in a text editor. Edit the style rules as  shown in Figure 6.37 .  follows:  1.  Confi gure a background image for the body element selector. Use the chapter6   gradientblue.jpg fi le found in the student fi les.   2. Modify the wrapper id. Confi gure a white background color  FFFFFF  and dark-blue  text color  000066  for this area. Change the width to 80%. Set the minimum width  to 700 pixels.  266  Chapter 6 Page Layout  Figure 6.37 The new Fish Creek two-column home page  index.html   3. Confi gure the header area. Remove the h1 element selector and style rules. Create a  new id named header with centered text, a dark-blue background color  000066 ,  and 10 pixels of padding.  4. Confi gure the left column area. Add a new style rule for the leftcolumn id to confi g-  ure an area that fl oats to the left and is 150 pixels wide.  5. You will organize the navigation hyperlinks within an unordered list in later tasks. The  navigation area in Figure 6.37 does not show list markers. Use a contextual selector  to confi gure unordered lists in the left column area to display without list markers  and no padding.  padding-left: 0;}  leftcolumn ul { list-style-type: none;  6. Confi gure the anchor tags in the leftcolumn id to display no underline.  leftcolumn a { text-decoration: none; }  7. Confi gure the :link , :visited , and :hover pseudo-classes for the leftcolumn  hyperlinks. Use the following text colors: 3262A3  unvisited hyperlinks , 6699FF   visited hyperlinks , and CCCCCC  hyperlinks with :hover  . For example,  leftcolumn a:link { color: 3262A3; }  8. Confi gure the right column area. Add a new style rule for the rightcolumn id to  confi gure an area with a 180 pixel left margin, 10 pixels of right padding, and 20  pixels of bottom padding.  9. Remove the main id. It is no longer used.  10. Modify the category class. Remove the background color style rule.  Save the fi shcreek.css fi le.

As you completed the  Chapter 5 Web Project case study activities, you completed a Web Project Topic Approval,  Web Project Site Map, and Web Project Page Layout Design. In this case study, you will  use your design documents as a guide as you develop the pages for your Web Project  using CSS in an external style sheet for both formatting and page layout.  Hands-On Practice Case  1.  Create a folder called project. All of your project fi les and graphics will be organized  in this folder and in subfolders as needed.  2. Refer to your Site Map to view the pages that you need to create. Jot down a list of the  fi le names. Add these to the Site Map.  3. Refer to the Page Layout Design. Make a list of the common fonts and colors used on  the pages. These may become the CSS you confi gure for the body element. Note where  typical elements used for organization  such as headings, lists, paragraphs, and so on   may be used. You may want to confi gure CSS for these elements. Identify various page  areas such as header, navigation, footer, and so on, and list any special confi gurations  needed for these areas. These will be confi gured as classes in your CSS. Create an  external style sheet, called project.css, which contains these confi gurations.  4. Using your design documents as a guide, code a representative page for your site.  Use CSS to format text, color, and layout. Apply classes and ids where appropriate.  Associate the web page to the external style sheet.  Save and test the page. Modify both the web page and the project.css fi le as needed.  Test and modify them until you have achieved the look you want.  5. Using the completed page as a template wherever possible, code the rest of the  pages on your site. Test and modify them as needed.  6. Experiment with modifying the project.css fi le. Change the page background color,  the font family, and so on. Test your pages in a browser. Notice how a change in a  single fi le can aff ect multiple fi les when external style sheets are used.  7  More on Links, Layout,  and Mobile   Chapter Objectives In this chapter, you will learn how to . . .  ● Code relative hyperlinks to web pages in folders  ● Configure a three-column page layout using CSS  within a website  ● Configure CSS for printing  ● Configure a hyperlink to a named fragment  ● Configure CSS for mobile display  internal to a web page  ● Utilize CSS3 media queries to target mobile devices  ● Configure images with CSS sprites  Now that you’ve had some experience coding HTML and CSS,  you’re ready to explore a variety of techniques in this chapter, including rela-  tive hyperlinks and named fragment hyperlinks, CSS sprites, three-column  page layout, styling for print, styling for mobile browsers, and configuring CSS3  media queries to target mobile devices.  277  278  7.1  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Another Look at Hyperlinks  Hyperlinks make the Web a “web” of interconnected information. In this section, you’ll  revisit the topic of hyperlinks and explore coding relative links using the target attribute  to open web pages in a new browser window, as well as coding hyper-  links that are internal to a web page.  More on Relative Linking  As indicated earlier in Chapter 2 , a relative hyperlink is used to link to  web pages within your site. You’ve been coding relative links to display  web pages within the same folder. There are times when you need to link  to files in other folders on your website. Let’s consider the example of a  website for a dog groomer that highlights services and products. The  web developer for this site created separate folders called services and  products in order to organize the site. See the folder and file listing  shown in Figure 7.1 .  Figure 7.1 The   dog groomer site  Relative Link Examples  contains the  images, products,  and services  folders  To review, when linking to a file in the same folder or directory, the value of the href is  the name of the file. For example, to link to the contact.html page from the home page   index.html , code the anchor element as follows:   Contact   When linking to a folder located within the current directory, use both the folder name  and the file name in the relative link. For example, to link to the collars.html page in the  products folder from the home page  index.html , code the anchor element as follows:   Collars   In Figure 7.1 , the collars.html page is located in a subfolder of the groomer folder. The  home page for the site  index.html  is located in the groomer folder. When linking to a file  that is up one directory level from the current page, use the “ ..  ” notation. To link to the  home page for the site from the collars.html page, code the anchor element as follows:   Home   When linking to a file that is in a folder on the same level as the current folder, the href  value will use the “ ..  ” notation to indicate moving up one level and then down to the  chosen folder. For example, to link to the bathing.html page in the services folder from  the collars.html page in the products folder, code the anchor element as follows:   Dog Bathing   Don’t worry if the use of “ ..  ” notation and linking to files in different folders seems  new and different. In most of the exercises in this book, you will code either absolute  links to other websites or relative links to files in the same folder.   7.1 Another Look at Hyperlinks  279  Fragment Identifiers  Browsers begin the display of a web page at the top of the document. However, there  are times when you need to provide the capability to link to a specific portion of a web  page instead of the top. You can accomplish this by coding a hyperlink to a fragment  identifier  sometimes called a named fragment or fragment id , which is simply an  VideoNote  Linking to a Named  Fragment  this technique.  HTML element assigned to an id. Lists of frequently asked questions  FAQs  often use  There are two components to your coding when using fragment identifiers:  1. The tag that identifies the named fragment of a web page: The tag must be as-  signed to an id. For example,    2. The anchor tag that links to the named fragment on a web page.  Linking to a named fragment is often seen on long web pages. You might see a “Back to  top” hyperlink that a visitor could select to cause the browser to quickly scroll the page  back to the top of the page for easy site navigation.  Another use of fragment identifiers helps to provide for accessibility. Web pages  may have a fragment identifier to indicate the beginning of the actual page content.  When the visitor clicks on the “Skip to content” hyperlink, the browser links to the  fragment identifier and shifts focus to the content area of the page. This “Skip to  content” or “Skip navigation” link provides a way for screen reader users to skip  repetitive navigation links  see Figure 7.2  . This is accomplished in two steps as  1. Establish the Target. Create the “Skip to content” fragment identifier by config-  uring a div that contains the page content with an id. For example,  Focus on  Accessibility  follows:     Figure 7.2 The  “Skip to Content”  link in action   280  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  2. Reference the Target. At the point of the page where you want to place a hyper-  link to the content, type an anchor element. Use the href attribute and place a    called a hash mark   before the name of the fragment identifier. The HTML for a  hyperlink to the named fragment “content” is   Skip to Content>   The hash mark indicates that the browser should search for an id on the same page. If  you forget to type the hash mark, the browser will not look on the same web page; it will  look for an external file.  Hands-On Practice 7.1  You  will  work  with  chapter7 starter1.html in  fragment   identifi  ers   in   this  Hands-On  Practice.  Locate  the student fi les. Figure 7.3 shows a screenshot of this web page.  Launch  a  text  editor  and  open  starter1.html.  Save  the  file  as  favorites.html.  Examine  the source  code and notice that the top portion of the page contains an unordered list with categories of in-  terest   such  as  Hobbies,  HTML,  Mobile  Web  Display,  and  Professional  Organizations   that corre-  spond  to  the  text  displayed  in  the  h2  elements  below.  Each  h2  element  is  followed  by  a definition  list of topics and URLs related to that category. It might be helpful to web page visitors if they  can click a category item and immediately jump to the page area that has information related to  that item. This could be a useful application of linking to fragment identifiers!  Figure 7.3 You will add   hyperlinks to fragment  identifi ers  7.1 Another Look at Hyperlinks  281  Modify the page as follows:   Hobbies   1. Code a named fragment for each h2 element in the defi nition list. For example,  2 . Add  hyperlinks  to  the  items  in  the  unordered  list  so  that  each  entry  will  link  to  its correspond-  3. Add a named fragment near the top of the page.  4. Near the bottom of the favorites.html page, add a hyperlink to return to the top of  ing heading.  the page.  Save the file and test it in a browser. Compare your work with the sample found in the student  files  chapter7 favorites.html .  There may be times when you need to link to a named fragment on another web page.  To accomplish this, place a “  ” followed by the fragment identifier id value after the file name  in the anchor tag. So, to link to the “Professional Organizations”  given that it is a named  fragment called “prof”  from any other page on the same website, you could use the  following HTML:   Professional Organizations   FAQ Why don’t some of my hyperlinks to fragment identifiers work?  The web browser fills the browser window  viewport  with the web page and will scroll to  display the named fragment at the top of the viewport. However, if there is not enough  “page” left below the named fragment, the content where the named fragment is located will  not be displayed at the top of the browser viewport. The browser tries to do the best it can  while still filling the viewport with the web page content. Try adding some blank lines  use  the   tag  or padding to the lower portion of the web page. Save your work and test  your hyperlinks again.  The Target Attribute  You may have noticed in Hands-On Practice 7.1 that when a visitor clicks on a hyperlink,  the new web page will automatically open in the same browser window. You can config-  ure the target attribute on an anchor tag with target="_blank" to open a hyperlink in  a new browser window or browser tab. For example,  <a href="  http:  yahoo.com  " target="_blank">Yahoo!  will open Yahoo!  home page in a new browser window or tab.  Note that you cannot control whether the web page opens in a new window or opens in  a new tab; this is dependent upon your visitor’s browser configuration. Why not create a  test page and try it? The target attribute with the value  "_blank"   configures the web  page to open in a new browser window or tab.  282  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Hands-On Practice 7.2  You  will  work  with  chapter7 favorites.html in  the   target  attribute   in   this  Hands-On  Practice.  Locate  the student fi les. Launch a text editor and open favorites.html. Save the fi le as target.html. Let’s  practice using the target attribute. Choose one of the external hyperlinks to modify. And add  target="_blank" so that the hyperlink opens in a new browser window or tab. The code is  shown below:  <a href="  http:  www.isoc.org  "     target="_blank">  http:  www.isoc.org  Save  the  file.  Launch  a  browser  and  test  the  file.  When  you  click  on  the  hyperlink  that  you modi-  fied, the new page will display in a new browser window or tab. You can compare your work to  the solution in the student files  chapter7 target.html .  Block Anchor  It’s typical to use anchor tags to configure phrases or even just a single word as a hyperlink.  HTML5 provides a new function for the anchor tag—the block anchor. A block anchor can  configure one or more elements  even those that display as a block, such as a div, h1, or  paragraph  as a hyperlink. See an example in the student files  chapter 7 block.html .  Telephone and Text Message Hyperlinks  If a web page displays a phone number, wouldn’t it be handy for a person using a smart-  phone to be able to tap on the phone number and place a call or send an SMS  Short  Message Service  text message? It’s very easy to configure a telephone hyperlink or SMS  hyperlink for use by smartphones.  According to RFC 3966, you can configure a telephone hyperlink by using a telephone  scheme: Begin the href value with tel: followed by the phone number. For example, to  configure a telephone hyperlink on a web page for use by mobile browsers, code as  follows:  Call 888-555-5555  .  RFC 5724 indicates that an SMS scheme hyperlink intended to send a text message can  be configured by beginning the href value with sms: followed by the phone number, as  shown in the following code:   Text 888-555-5555 .  Not all mobile browsers and devices support telephone and text hyperlinks, but expect  increased use of this technology in the future. You’ll get a chance to practice using the  tel: scheme in the Chapter 7 case study.   7.2  CSS Sprites  When browsers display web pages, they must make a separate http request for every  file used by the page, including .css files and image files such as .gif, .jpg, and .png  files. Each http request takes time and resources. As mentioned in Chapter 4 , a sprite is  7.2 CSS Sprites  283  an image file that contains multiple small graphics. Using  CSS to configure the small graphics combined in the sprite as  background images for various web page elements is called  CSS sprites , a technique made popular by David Shea    http:  www.alistapart.com articles sprites  .  The CSS sprites technique uses the CSS background-image ,  background-repeat , and background-position properties to  manipulate the placement of the background image. The single  graphics file saves download time because the browser only  needs to make one http request for the combined image instead  Figure 7.4 The sprite consists of two images  of many requests for the individual smaller images. Figure 7.4   in a single graphics fi le  shows a sprite with two lighthouse images on a transparent  background. These images are configured as background images for the navigation  hyperlinks with CSS as shown in Figure 7.5 . You’ll see this in action as you complete the  next Hands-On Practice.  Figure 7.5 Sprites in action  Hands-On Practice 7.3  You will work with CSS sprites in this Hands-On Practice as you create the web page  shown in Figure 7.5 . Create a new folder named sprites. Locate chapter7 starter2.html in  the student fi les. Copy starter2.html into your sprites folder. Copy the following fi les from  chapter7 starters into your sprites folder: lighthouseisland.jpg, lighthouselogo.jpg, and  sprites.gif. The sprites.gif, shown in Figure 7.4 , contains two lighthouse images. The fi rst  lighthouse image starts at the top of the graphics fi le. The second lighthouse image begins  100 pixels down from the top of the graphics fi le. We’ll use the value 100 when we confi gure  the display of the second image.  284  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Launch  a  text  editor  and  open  starter2.html.  Save  the  file  as  index.html.  You  will  edit  the embed-  ded styles to configure background images for the navigation hyperlinks.  1. Confi gure the background image for navigation hyperlinks. Add the following styles to the  nav a selector to set the background image to the sprites.gif with no repeat. The value  right in the background-position property confi gures the lighthouse image to display  at the right of the navigation element. The value 0 in the background-position  property  confi  gures  the  display  at  offset  0  from  the  top   at  the  very  top   so  the  fi  rst lighthouse  image displays.  nav a { text-decoration: none;  display: block;  padding: 20px;  background-color: b3c7e6;  border-bottom: 1px solid ffffff;  background-image: url sprites.gif ;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  background-position: right 0; }  2. Confi gure the second lighthouse image to display when the mouse pointer passes over the  hyperlink. Add the following styles to the nav a:hover selector to display the second  lighthouse image. The value right in the background-position property confi gures the  lighthouse image to display at the right of the navigation element. The value -100px in the  background-position property confi gures the display at an offset of 100 pixels down  from the top so the second lighthouse image appears.  nav a:hover { background-color: eaeaea;   color: 869dc7;  background-position: right -100px; }  Save the file and test it in a browser. Your page should look similar to Figure 7.5 . Move your  mouse pointer over the navigation hyperlinks to see the background images change. Compare  your work with the sample found in the student files  chapter7 sprites index.html .  FAQ How can I create my own sprite graphics file?  Most web developers use a graphics application such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks,  or GIMP to edit images and save them in a single graphics file for use as a sprite. Or, you  could use a web-based sprite generator such as the ones listed below:  ● CSS Sprites Generator: http:  csssprites.com  ● CSS Sprite Generator: http:  spritegen.website-performance.org  ● SpriteMe: http:  spriteme.org  If you already have a sprite graphic, check out the online tool at Sprite Cow     http:  www.spritecow.com     that  can  generate  pixel-perfect background-position  property values for a sprite.  7.3 Three-Column CSS Page Layout   285  Checkpoint 7.1  1. Why should you organize the files in a website using folders and subfolders?  2. Which attribute configures a hyperlink to open the file in a new browser window or tab?  3. State an advantage of using CSS sprites in a website.  7.3  Three-Column CSS Page Layout  Often a web page layout will consist of a header across the top of the  page with three columns below: navigation, content, and sidebar. If you  are thinking about this layout as a series of boxes—you’re thinking cor-  rectly for configuring pages using CSS! Figure 7.6 shows a wireframe of  this page layout design. Figure 7.7 shows a web page configured using  this design. You will create this page in the next Hands-On Practice.  Figure 7.6 Wireframe for a three-  column page layout  Figure 7.7 This three-column page layout is designed using CSS  Hands-On Practice 7.4  In this Hands-On Practice, you will develop your fi rst three-column web page using CSS. The  same techniques that you used to confi gure the two-column page will apply here. Think of the  page as a series of elements or boxes. Using a wireframe as a guide, confi gure the basic page  structure  with  HTML.  Then  code  CSS  to  confi  gure  page  areas;  use  ids  or  classes  when appropri-  ate.  Recall  that  a  key  technique  for  creating  a  two-column  web  page  with  left-column navigation  was to design the left column to fl oat to the left. A key technique for our three-column page is to  286  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  code the left column with float:left and the right column with float:right . The center  column occupies the middle of the browser window. Refer to Figures 7.6 and 7.7 as you  complete this Hands-On Practice.  Getting Started  the folder.  Part 1: Code the HTML  Locate the showybg.jpg, plsthumb.jpg, and trillium.jpg files in the chapter7 starters  folder in the student files. Create a new folder called wildflowers3. Copy the files to  Review Figures 7.6 and 7.7 . Notice the page elements: a header area with a background  image; a left column with a navigation area and an image; a center column with paragraphs  of text, headings, and an image that floats to the right; a right column with two news items;  and a footer. These will all be coded to use ids and classes that correspond to CSS, which  configures a number of properties, including the float, margin, border, font-family, and so on.  The navigation menu hyperlinks will be configured using an unordered list. As you code the  HTML document, you will place the elements on the page and assign id and class values that  correspond to the wireframe areas in Figure 7.6 .

Your dis-  play will not look like Figure 7.7 because you have not yet configured the CSS. The top of your  page should look similar to the page shown in Figure 7.8 .  Figure 7.8 The three-column  page before CSS is applied  288  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Part 2: Code the Basic CSS  For ease of editing, in this Hands-On Practice, you will code the CSS as embedded styles in the  header section of the web page. However, if you were creating an entire website, you would  most likely use an external style sheet. Launch a text editor and open index.html. Let’s take a   moment to consider the main elements used on the page shown in Figure 7.6 : header, left-col-  umn navigation area, right-column sidebar area, center column, and footer. The left column will  contain  a  navigation  area  and  a  small  image.  The  center  column  will  contain  paragraphs,  a head-  ing, and a right-floating image. The right column will contain a series of headings and news  items. Locate these areas on the sketch in Figure 7.6 . Notice also that the same font is used  throughout the page and the page begins immediately at the browser margin.  With your file open in a text editor, modify the head section of your document and code a    tag. Now let’s consider the CSS configuration. Type the CSS in your document as in-  1. Body Element Selector. Set the margin to 0. Confi gure the background color to ffffff.  dicated below:  body { margin:0;  background-color: ffffff; }  2. Container. Confi gure this area with background  eeeeee  and text  006600  colors, a  minimum width of 960 pixels, and a font family of Verdana, Arial, or sans-serif.  3. Header. Confi gure a background color  636631  and a background image  position  showybg.jpg at the bottom of the element to repeat horizontally . Set the height to 120  pixels, text color to cc66cc, text alignment to right, no top padding, no bottom padding,  20 pixels left padding, and 20 pixels right padding. Confi gure a 2 pixel solid black border  container { background-color: eeeeee;  color: 006600;  min-width: 960px;  font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }  across the bottom of this area.  header { background-color: 636631;  background-image: url showybg.jpg ;  background-position: bottom;  background-repeat: repeat-x;  height: 120px;  color: cc66cc;  text-align: right;  padding: 0 20px;  nav { float: left;  width: 150px; }  border-bottom: 2px solid 000000; }  4. Left Column. One of the keys to this three-column page layout is that the left navigation  column is designed to fl oat to the left of the browser window. Confi gure a width of 150 pixels.  5. Right Column. One of the keys to this three-column page layout is that the right sidebar  column  is  designed  to  fl  oat  to  the  right  of  the  browser  window.  Confi  gure  a  width  of  200 pixels.   7.3 Three-Column CSS Page Layout  289  sidebar { float: right;  width: 200px; }  6. Center. The center column will take up all of the room that is available after the left and right columns fl oat. The content area has a special need for margins because the left and right  columns are fl oating on either side. Set the left margin to 160 pixels, the right margin to 210  pixels, and the remaining margins to 0. Also confi gure the padding for this area. Set the  background  ffffff  and text  006600  colors.  center { margin: 0 210px 0 160px;  padding: 1px 10px 20px 10px;  background-color: ffffff;  color: 006600; }  7. Footer. Confi gure the page footer with very small text that is centered. Confi gure the  background  ffffff  and text  006600  colors for this area. Set the top padding to 10 pixels.  Clear the fl oated image in the center content area.  footer { font-size: .70em;  text-align: center;  color: 006600;  background-color: ffffff;  padding-top: 10px;  clear: both; }  At this point, you have configured the main elements of the three-column page layout. Code the  closing HTML style tag with   . Save index.html in the wildflowers3 folder. It’s a good  idea to open your page in a browser to make sure you are on the right track. It should look  similar to the one shown in Figure 7.9 . Note that there is still some detail work to do, but you  are well on your way!  Figure 7.9 The CSS for the basic elements of the three-column layout has been completed   290  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Part 3: Continue Coding CSS  Now you are ready to continue with your styles. Open index.html in a text editor and position  your cursor on a blank line above the closing style tag.  1. Header Area.  a.  The h1 Element Selector. Notice the extra space above the “Door County Wildfl owers”  text, which is contained within the   element in the header area. You can reduce this  extra space by setting a 0 top margin for the h1 element selector. Also confi gure left  alignment, text shadow, and a font size of 3em for the h1 selector.  Skip to Content. Confi gure the “Skip to Content” hyperlink in the header area with a  0.80em font size. Also confi gure pseudo-classes for :link , :visited , :hover ,  Navigation Menu.

Part 4: Test the Page  Now that your styles are coded, test the index.html page again. Your page should look similar  to the screenshot shown in Figure 7.7 . Recall that Internet Explorer does not support the  text-shadow property. If there are other differences, verify the id and class values in your  HTML. Also check the syntax of your CSS. You may find the W3C CSS Validation Service at  http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator to  be  helpful  when  verifying  CSS  syntax.  The  student  files contain a copy of this page in the chapter7 wildflowers folder.  7.4  CSS Styling for Print  Even though the “paperless society” has been talked about for decades, the fact is that  many people still love paper and you can expect your web pages to be printed. CSS of-  fers you some control over what gets printed and how the printouts are configured. This  is easy to do using external style sheets. Create one external style sheet with the config-  urations for browser display and a second external style sheet with the special printing  configurations. Associate both of the external style sheets to the web page using two  292  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile   link elements. The link elements will utilize the media attribute , which indicates the  media type for which the styles are intended, such as screen display or print display.  See a list of media attribute values in Table 7.1 .  Table 7.1 The media attribute  Value  Purpose  screen  print  handheld  Default value; Indicates the style sheet that configures the typical browser viewport  display on a color computer screen  Indicates the style sheet that configures the printed formatting  Although this value is intended by the W3C to indicate the style sheet that configures display  on handheld mobile devices, in practice, the attribute value is not reliably applied  see Return  of the Mobile Stylesheet at http:  www.alistapart.com articles return-of-the-mobile-stylesheet  for more information . The next section will describe other methods for configuring the  design of mobile web pages.  Modern browsers will use the correct screen or print style sheet, depending on whether  they are rendering a screen display or preparing to print a document. Configure the link  element for your browser display with media="screen" . Configure the link element for  your printout with media="print" . An example of the HTML follows:        Print Styling Best Practices  You might be wondering how a print style sheet should differ from the CSS used to display  the web page in a browser. Commonly used techniques for styling print are listed below.  Hide Non-Essential Content  It’s common practice to prevent banner ads, navigation, or other extraneous areas from  appearing on the printout. Use the display: none; style declaration to hide content  that is not needed on a printout of the web page.  Configure Font Size and Color for Printing  Another common practice is to configure the font sizes on the print style sheet to use pt  units. This will better control the text on the printout. You might also consider configuring  the text color to black  000000  if you envision the need for visitors to print your pages  often. The default setting on most browsers prevent background colors and background  images from printing, but you can also prevent background image display in your print  style sheet.  Control Page Breaks  Use the CSS page-break-before or  page-break-after  properties to control page  breaks when printing the web page. Well-supported values for these properties are  always  the page break will always occur as designated , avoid  if possible, the page  break will occur before or after, as designated , and auto  default . For example, to   7.4 CSS Styling for Print  293  configure a page break at a specific point in the document  in this case, right before an  element assigned to the class named newpage  , configure the CSS as shown below:  .newpage { page-break-before: always; }  Print URLs for Hyperlinks  Consider whether a person would find it useful to see the actual URL for a resource  when reading the printout of your web page. You can use CSS to display the value of the  href attribute right on the page using two CSS coding techniques: a CSS pseudo-ele-  ment and the CSS content property. The purpose of a CSS pseudo-element is to apply  some type of effect to its selector. Table 7.2 lists pseudo-elements and their purpose.  Table 7.2 CSS 2.1 pseudo-elements  Inserts generated content after the selector: Configure the generated content  Inserts generated content before the selector: Configure the generated content  Pseudo-element  Purpose  :after  with the content property  :before  with the content property  :first-letter  :first-line  Applies styles to the first letter of text  Applies styles to the first line of text  Use the CSS content property along with the :after and :before pseudo-elements to  generate content. A useful feature of the content property is the attr X  function,  which returns the value of the HTML attribute provided. You can use this to print the URL  of a hyperlink  the value of the href attribute . Use quotation marks to contain addi-  tional text or characters, such as parentheses. The CSS below will display the URL for  each hyperlink in the sidebar area within parentheses after the text hyperlink.  sidebar a:after { content: "  " attr href  "  "; }  Figure 7.10 shows the print preview of the content page you created in Hands-On   Practice 7.4  see Figure 7.7  . Notice that the print preview includes the navigation area.  Figure 7.10 Print  preview of the  page displayed in  Figure 7.7  294  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Figure 7.11 Print preview using CSS to confi gure for printing  Figure 7.11 displays an alternate version of the page that uses CSS to prevent the  display of the navigation area, configures pt units for font sizes, and prints the URL  for the hyperlinks in the sidebar area. You will explore these techniques in the next  Hands-On Practice.  Hands-On Practice 7.5  In this Hands-On Practice, you will code special styles for use when printing a web page. We  will use the Door County Wildfl owers index.html page from Hands-On Practice 7.4 as a  starting point. Figure 7.7 shows a browser display of the index.html page. You will create a  new version of index.html that is associated with two external style sheets: one for the screen  display and the other for printing. When you are fi nished, your printed page should resemble  Figure 7.11 .  Getting Started  Create a new folder named wildflowersPrint. Copy into your new folder index.html, plsthumb.jpg,  showybg.jpg, and trillium.jpg from the chapter7 wildflowers folder in the student files.  Part 1: Create a Style Sheet for Screen Display   Launch a text editor and open index.html. Copy all of the style rules between the opening and  closing style tags. Use your text editor to create a new file and save it as wildflower.css in your  wildflowersPrint folder. Paste the style rules into wildflower.css and save the file.  7.4 CSS Styling for Print  295  Part 2: Edit the HTML  Edit index.html and remove the style tags. Code a link element to associate the web page with  the external style sheet that you just created  wildflower.css . Add the media attribute with the  value of "screen" to the link element for wildflower.css. Code a second link element to invoke  an external style sheet called wildflowerprint.css for printing   media="print"  . The HTML is  as follows:        Save index.html in the wildflowersPrint folder.  Part 3: Code the New Style Sheet for Print Display  Launch a text editor and open wildflower.css. Because you want to keep most of the styles for  printing, you will modify a copy of the screen display external style sheet. Save wildflower.css as  wildflowerprint.css  in  the  wildflowersPrint  folder.  You  will  modify  several  areas  on  this  style sheet,  including the container id, h1 element selector, header id, nav id, center id, and the  hyperlinks located in the header and sidebar ids.  Remove the style declaration for minimum width   min-width   from the container id.  1. Modify the h1 element selector so that the printer will use 24 point font size. Remove the  2. Modify the header id style rules. Confi gure a white background color  ffffff . Remove the  background image declaration. The height property is also not needed because there is no  longer a background image. Also remove the text alignment and padding properties.  text-align property.  h1 { margin-top: 0;  font-size: 24pt;  text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 000000; }  header { color: cc66cc;  background-color: ffffff;  border-bottom: 2px solid 000000;  padding: 0 20px; }  3. Confi gure the “Skip to Content” hyperlink in the header id to not display. Replace all style  rules associated with header a with the following:  header a { display: none; }  4. Confi gure the navigation area to not display. Remove all style rules associated with nav and  5. Confi gure the center area. Modify the style rule for center . Set the left margin to 0, the  add the following:  nav { display: none; }  right margin to 40%, and the font size to 12pt.  296  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile   6. Confi gure the width of the sidebar to 40%.  center { margin: 0 40% 0 0;  padding: 1px 10px 20px 10px;  font-size: 12pt;  background-color: ffffff;  color: 006600; }  sidebar { float: right;  width: 40%; }  .news { font-size: 10pt;  margin: 10px; }  Add the following CSS:  sidebar a:after { content "  " attr href  "  ";  font-size: 8pt;  color: 000000; }  element selector to be white  ffffff .  Save your file in the wildflowersPrint folder.  Part 4: Test Your Work  7. Confi gure the news class. Modify the style rule to confi gure the font size to 10pt.  8. Confi gure the hyperlinks in the sidebar area so that the URLs are printed in 8pt black font.  9. Look through the style rules and confi gure the background-color for each h2 and h3  Test index.html in a browser. Select File > Print > Preview. Your display should look similar to the  page shown in Figure 7.11 . The font sizes have been configured and the navigation does not  display. The URLs appear after the hyperlink text in the sidebar area. The student files contain a  solution in the chapter7 print folder.  Note that there is a change in CSS3 syntax, which requires two colons in front of each pseudo-  element  for example, CSS3 uses ::after instead of :after  . However, we’ll stick with the  CSS2 pseudo-elements and syntax for now because there is broader browser support.  7.5  CSS Styling for the Mobile Web  Chapter 5 introduced you to three methods that can be used to provide access for website  visitors who use mobile devices. One option is to design and publish a second website  with a .mobi TLD. Visit JCPenney at http:  jcp.com and http:  jcp.mobi to see this in  practice. Another option is to design and publish a separate website within your own do-  main that is optimized for mobile use. This technique is utilized by the White House at  http:  www.whitehouse.gov   Figure 7.12  . The mobile version of the White House website  can be viewed at http:  m.whitehouse.gov   Figure 7.13  .

Before  we focus on coding, let’s consider design techniques for the mobile web.  Mobile Web Design Best Practices  Mobile web users are typically on-the-go, need information quickly, and  may be easily distracted. A web page that is optimized for mobile access  should try to serve these needs. Take a moment to review Figures 7.12 and  7.13 and observe how the design of the mobile website addresses the de-  sign considerations discussed in Chapter 5 :  ● Small screen size. The size of the header area is reduced to accom-   modate a small screen display.  ● Low bandwidth  slow connection speed . Note that the large  images visible in Figure 7.12 are not displayed on the mobile ver-  sion of the web page.  ● Font, color, and media issues. Common font typefaces are utilized.  There is also good contrast between text and background color.  ● Awkward controls, and limited processor and memory. The mobile  website uses a single-column page layout that facilitates keyboard  Figure 7.13 The mobile version  of the White House website    http:  m.whitehouse.gov    tabbing and will be easy to control by touch. The page is mostly  text, which will be quickly rendered by a mobile browser.  ● Functionality. Hyperlinks to popular site features display directly under the  header. A search feature is also provided.  298  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Let’s build on this base of design considerations and expand them.  Optimize Layout for Mobile Use  A single-column page layout   Figure 7.14   with a small header, key navigation links,  content, and page footer works well for a mobile device display. Mobile screen resolutions  vary greatly  for example, 320×240 [BlackBerry Pearl], 320×480 [Apple iPhone3, Android  HTC Dream], 360×640 [Nokia], 480×800 [Android HTC Desire, Windows HTC Pro], and  640×690 [Apple iPhone4, but with a higher pixel density than iPhone3] . W3C recom-  mendations include the following:  ● Limit scrolling to one direction.  ● Use heading elements.  ● Use lists to organize information  such as unordered lists, ordered lists, and  ● Avoid using tables  see Chapter 8   because they typically force both horizontal  definition lists .  Figure 7.14  Wireframe for a  typical single-  column mobile  and vertical scrolling on mobile devices.  ● Provide labels for form controls  see Chapter 9  .   page layout  ● Avoid using pixel units in style sheets.  ● Avoid absolute positioning in style sheets.  ● Hide content that is not essential for mobile use.  Optimize Navigation for Mobile Use  following:  ● Provide minimal navigation near the top of the page.  ● Provide consistent navigation.  Easy-to-use navigation is crucial on a mobile device. The W3C recommends the  ● Avoid hyperlinks that open files in new windows or pop-up windows.  ● Try to balance both the number of hyperlinks on a page and the number of levels  of links needed to access information.  Optimize Graphics for Mobile Use  for mobile use:  Graphics can help to engage visitors, but be aware of the following W3C recommendations  ● Avoid displaying images that are wider than the screen width  assume a 320  pixel screen width on a smartphone display .  ● Configure alternate small, optimized background images.  ● Some mobile browsers will downsize all images, so images with text may become  difficult to read.  ● Avoid the use of large graphic images.  ● Specify the size of images.  ● Provide alternate text for graphics and other non-text elements.   7.5 CSS Styling for the Mobile Web  299  Optimize Text for Mobile Use  It can be difficult to read text on a small mobile device. The following W3C recommenda-  tions will aid your mobile visitors.  ● Configure good contrast between text and background colors.  ● Use common font typefaces.  ● Configure font size with em units or percentages.  ● Use a short, descriptive page title.  The W3C has published Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0, a list of 60 mobile  web design best practices, at http:  www.w3.org TR mobile-bp . Visit  http:  www.w3.org 2007 02 mwbp_flip_cards.html for flipcards that  summarize the Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 document.  Design for One Web  The W3C mission of building “ One Web” refers to the concept of providing  a single resource that is configured for optimal display on multiple types of  devices. This is more efficient than creating multiple versions of a web  document. With the “One Web” in mind, we’ll next explore using the view-  port meta tag and CSS media queries to target and deliver style sheets  that are optimized for mobile display to mobile devices.  Viewport Meta Tag  There are multiple uses for meta tags. You’ve used the meta tag since  Chapter 2 to configure the character encoding on a web page. Now,  Figure 7.15 Mobile display of a  we’ll explore the new viewport meta tag, which was created as an  web page  Apple extension that helps with displays on mobile devices such as  iPhones and Android smartphones by setting the width and scale of  the viewport. Figure 7.15 displays a screen shot of a web page dis-  played on an Android smartphone without the viewport meta tag.   Examine Figure 7.15 and notice that the mobile device zoomed out to  display the entire web page on the tiny screen. The text on the web  page is difficult to read.  Figure 7.16 shows the same web page after the viewport meta tag  was added to the head section of the document. The code is shown  below:  <meta name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  Code the viewport meta tag with the HTML name="viewport" and  content attributes. The value of the HTML content attribute can be  one or more directives  also referred to as properties by Apple ,  such as the device-width directive and directives that control  zooming and scale. Table 7.3 lists viewport meta tag directives and  Figure 7.16 The viewport meta tag  their values.  helps with mobile displays  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Table 7.3 Viewport meta tag directives  300  Directive  Values  Purpose  width  Numeric value or device-width which  The width of the viewport in pixels  indicates actual width of the device screen  height  Numeric value or device-height  The height of the viewport in pixels  which indicates actual height of the   Numeric multiplier; Set to 1 for 100%  Initial scale of the viewport  Numeric multiplier; Mobile Safari default  Minimum scale of the viewport  Numeric multiplier; Mobile Safari default  Maximum scale of the viewport  device screen  initial-scale  initial scale  minimum-scale  is 0.25  maximum-scale  is 1.6  user-scalable  yes allows scaling, no disables scaling  Determines whether a user can zoom  in or out  use? That’s where CSS comes into play.  CSS Media Queries  Now that you’ve scaled the page to be readable, what about styling it for optimal mobile  Earlier in the chapter, you used the link element along with media="print" to  configure styles for printing web pages. The attribute value media="handheld" was  originally intended to serve the same purpose, but it has not been well supported.  So, with media="handheld" not working, what can you do? Use a media query  see  http:  www.w3.org TR css3-mediaqueries    to  determine  the  capability  of  the  mobile  device, such as screen resolution and orientation  portrait or  landscape , and direct browsers to styles configured specifically for those  capabilities. Figure 7.17 shows the same web page as Figures 7.15 and  7.16 , but it looks quite different because of a link element that includes  media queries and is associated with a style sheet configured for optimal  mobile display. The HTML is shown below:  <link href="lighthousemobile.css" rel="stylesheet"  media="only screen and  max-device-width: 480px ">  The code sample above will configure an optimal display for the most pop-  ular smartphones. The value only is a keyword that will hide the media  query from outdated browsers. The value screen targets devices with  screens. The max-device-width media feature  see Table 7.4   is set to  480px , which will target the most popular smartphone viewport dimen-  sions. Commonly used media types and keywords include the following:  ● all targets all devices  ● screen targets screens  Figure 7.17 CSS media queries  help to confi gure the page for  mobile display  ● only causes older nonsupporting browsers to ignore the media query   ● print targets printout  7.5 CSS Styling for the Mobile Web  Table 7.4 Commonly used media query features  301  Features  Values  Criteria  max-device-height  Numeric value  max-device-width  Numeric value  min-device-height  Numeric value  min-device-width  Numeric value  max-height  Numeric value  min-height  Numeric value  max-width  Numeric value  min-width  Numeric value  The height of the screen size of the output device in  pixels is smaller than or equal to the value  The width of the screen size of the output device in  pixels is smaller than or equal to the value  The height of the screen size of the output device in  pixels is greater than or equal to the value  The width of the screen size of the output device in  pixels is greater than or equal to the value  The height of the viewport in pixels is smaller than or  equal to the value;  reevaluated when screen is resized   The height of the viewport in pixels is greater than or  equal to the value;  reevaluated when screen is resized   The width of the viewport in pixels is smaller than or  equal to the value;  reevaluated when screen is resized   The width of the viewport in pixels is greater than or  equal to the value;  reevaluated when screen is resized   orientation  Portrait or landscape  The orientation of the device  Testing Mobile Display  The best way to test the mobile display of a web page is to publish it to the Web and  access it from a mobile device.  See Appendix G for an introduction to publishing a   website with FTP.  However, not everyone has access to a smartphone. Several options  for emulating a mobile display are listed below:  ● Opera Mobile Emulator  Windows Only download and install   http:  www.opera.com developer tools mobile  Supports media queries.  ● Mobilizer  Windows and Mac download and install   http:  www.springbox.com mobilizer  Supports media queries.  ● Web-Based Opera Mini 4.2 Simulator  Runs in a browser window   http:  www.opera.com mobile demo ?ver=4  Disables background images; supports media queries.  ● Web-Based Opera Mini 6 Simulator  Runs in a browser window   http:  www.opera.com mobile demo  Disables background images; supports media queries.  ● iPhone Emulator  Runs in a browser window   http:  www.testiphone.com  Does not support media queries.  ● iPhoney  Mac only download and install   http:  www.marketcircle.com iphoney  Does not support media queries.  302  1.  2.  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  Testing with a Desktop Browser  What if you don’t have a smartphone and are unable to publish your files to  the Web? You can approximate the mobile display of your site using a desk-  top browser by using the following technique:  Modify the link element to point to your mobile CSS style sheet.  Display your page in a desktop browser and then reduce the width  and height of the viewport until it approximates a mobile screen size   such as 320×480 .   Figure 7.18 demonstrates this technique. The Firefox browser was  used to display the same website using the mobile style sheet  Figure 7.18 A desktop browser   see Figure 7.17  .  was used to approximate the  mobile display  For Serious Developers Only  If you are a software developer or information systems major, you may want to explore  the SDKs  Software Developer Kits  for the iOS and Android platforms. Each SDK in-  cludes a mobile device emulator.  ● iOS SDK  Mac only   http:  developer.apple.com programs ios develop.html  ● Android SDK  http:  developer.android.com sdk index.html  Now that you’re aware of some mobile design considerations, how to target a mobile  device, and options for mobile testing and emulation, let’s apply your new knowledge  by configuring the web page shown in Figure 7.17 .  Hands-On Practice 7.6  Create a new folder named mobile. Locate chapter7 starter2.html in the student fi les. Copy  starter2.html into your mobile folder. Rename the starter2.html fi le as index.html. Copy the  following files from chapter7 starters into your mobile folder: lighthouseisland.jpg,  lighthouselogo.jpg, and mobilelogo.jpg. Launch a browser and view starter2.html as shown  in Figure 7.19 . You will confi gure the web page to use the viewport meta tag and media  queries to target mobile devices. You’ll confi gure CSS for both desktop and mobile display.  Part 1: Create a New Style Sheet  Launch a text editor and open index.html. Copy all the style rules between the opening and  closing style tags. Use your text editor to create a new file and save it as lighthouse.css in your  mobile folder. Paste the style rules into lighthouse.css and save the file.  Part 2: Edit the HTML  1. Edit index.html and remove the style tags. Code a link element to associate the web page  with the external style sheet that you just created  lighthouse.css . Add the media attribute  with the value of screen to the link element for lighthouse.css. Code a second link element  to invoke an external style sheet called lighthousemobile.css for mobile display. The HTML  code follows:   7.5 CSS Styling for the Mobile Web  303  Figure 7.19 Web  page displayed in  a desktop  browser     <link href="lighthousemobile.css" rel="stylesheet"  media="only screen and  max-device-width: 480px ">  2. Confi gure a viewport meta tag below the link elements. The HTML code follows:  <meta name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  3. The mobile display will benefi t from a “Back to Top” link at the bottom of the page. Add a div  assigned to an id named backtotop at the bottom of the content area that contains a  hyperlink to the header id. The HTML code follows:    Back to Top    Save the index.html file in the mobile folder.  Part 3: Code the New CSS  Launch  a  text  editor  and  open  lighthouse.css.  Because  you  will  want  to  keep  most  of  the styles  for mobile display, you will start by creating a new version of the external style sheet. Save the  lighthouse.css file as lighhousemobile.css in the mobile folder. You will modify several areas on  this style sheet, including the body element selector, wrapper id, h1 element selector, header  id, nav id, content id, footer id, and the navigation hyperlinks.  1. Modify the body element selector. Add a style rule to confi gure no margins.  body { font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;  background-color: 00005D;  margin: 0; }  304   4. Eliminate the margin confi gured for the h1 element selector.  5. Modify the nav id style rules. Remove the fl oat. Set the width to 100% and the font size  Chapter 7 More on Links, Layout, and Mobile  2. Modify the wrapper id style rules to also confi gure 100% width, no margin, no padding, and  no minimum width.  wrapper { background-color: b3c7e6;  3. Modify the header id style rules. Change the padding as indicated below. Change the font  size to 100%. Confi gure the mobilelogo.jpg as a background image that does not repeat. Set  the position of the background image to display at the top on the right side.  color: 000066;  width: 100%;  margin: 0;  padding: 0;  min-width: 0; }  header { background-color: 869dc7;  color: 00005D;  font-size: 100%;  padding: 0.5em 0 0 0.5em;  background-image: url mobilelogo.jpg ;  background-repeat: no-repeat;  background-position: right top; }  h1 { margin: 0; }  to 120%.  nav { float: none;  width: 100%;  font-size: 120%;  letter-spacing: 0.1em;  font-weight: bold; }  color: 000000;  padding: 0.5em;  overfl ow: auto; }  6. Modify the content id style rules. Change the padding to 0.5em.  content { background-color: ffffff;  7. Modify the footer id style rules. Set the padding to 0.  footer { font-size: 70%;  text-align: center;  padding: 0;  background-color: 869dc7;  clear: both; }  7.5 CSS Styling for the Mobile Web  305  h2 { color: 869dc7;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  margin: 0; }  8. Eliminate the margin for the h2 element selector.   9. Confi gure the paragraph element selector to have a 0.05em margin.  10. Confi gure the floatright class to not fl oat and to have no margin.  11. Confi gure a new style rule for li elements in the nav id. Set the padding to 0.  12. Modify the styles for hyperlinks in the nav id. Set the padding as shown below:  p {margin: 0.05em; }  floatright { margin: 0;  fl oat: none; }  nav li { padding: 0; }  nav a { text-decoration: none;  display: block;  padding: 0.5em;  background-color: b3c7e6;  border-bottom: 1px solid ffffff; }  backtotop {display: block; }  Save your file in the mobile folder.

The Media Queries website at http:  mediaqueri.es displays a gallery of  sites that demonstrate responsive web design , which Ethan Marcotte  http:  www.alistapart.com articles responsive-web-design    describes  as  progressively     enhancing a web page for different viewing contexts  such as smartphones and  tablets  through the use of techniques, including media queries. The screen captures  in the gallery at http:  mediaqueri.es show web pages at the following screen  widths: 320px  smartphone display , 768px  tablet display , 1024px  netbook  display , and 1600px  desktop display . Visit Hardboiled CSS3 Media Queries at  http:  www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk blog about hardboiled_css3_media_queries  to explore sample media query code that targets a variety of device types and  displays.   Although the examples in this book use separate style sheets for desktop and mobile  display, you could include all of the styles in a single style sheet and write media  queries directly in the CSS using the @media rule . The sample code below displays a  different background image specifically for smartphone display.  @media only screen and  max-device-width: 480px  {  header { background-image: url mobile.gif ; }  FAQ Does using media queries save on bandwidth?  While using media queries to target mobile devices creates a useful and functional web  page for your mobile web visitors, the technique does not save bandwidth. While media  queries should cause browsers to apply only specific styles, current browsers still  download all of the style sheets and resources  such as background images  associated  with your web page just in case they are needed. So, it’s still a good idea to optimize all  of your images to reduce the amount of bandwidth required by mobile devices. Hopefully,  future versions of browsers will only download the resources that are initially needed when  a page displays.  This section provided an introduction to mobile web design. You created a style  sheet that configured a single-column mobile page layout for an existing website. If  you are designing a new website, an alternate approach is to design the mobile  style sheet first and then develop alternate style sheets for tablet and or desktop  browsers that progressively enhance the design with multiple columns and  larger images. You can find out more about this “Mobile First” approach at  http:  www.lukew.com ff entry.asp?933 . As mobile devices evolve and usage  increases, there are sure to be new developments in this area of web design.

Modify the Design of Hands-On Practice 7.4. Locate the index.html page  you created in Hands-On Practice 7.4. This file is in the chapter 7 wildflowers  folder in the student files. Recall from Chapter 5 that a web page using jello  design has content in the center of the web page with blank margins on  either side. Configure the style rules for index.html to display the page in this  manner.  9. Create a Mobile Design for Hands-On Practice 7.4. Locate the index.html  page you created in Hands-On Practice 7.4. This file is in the chapter 7 wildflowers  folder in the student files. Modify the web page so that it links to an external  style sheet  flowers.css  instead of using embedded styles. Save and test  your page. Create a new style sheet  mymobile.css , which will configure the  page for mobile display with a single-column layout  see Figure 7.14  . Modify  the index.html page to be associated with this file. Configure the viewport  meta tag and CSS media queries for smartphone mobile display. Save all  files and test your page with both a desktop browser and a mobile device or  emulator.  10. Practice Validating CSS. Choose a CSS external style sheet file to validate   perhaps you have created one for your own website . Otherwise, use an external  style sheet file that you worked on in this chapter. Use the free W3C CSS  Validation Service   http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator  . If your CSS does not im-  mediately pass the validation test, modify it and test again. Repeat this process   until W3C validates your CSS code. Write a one- or two-paragraph summary about  the validation process. Answer the following questions: Was it easy to use? Did  anything surprise you? Did you encounter a number of errors or just a few? How  easy was it to determine how to correct the CSS file? Would you recommend this  to other students? Why or why not?  Web Research  As you read about mobile web design best practices in this chapter, you may have no-  ticed some overlap with techniques that provide for accessibility, such as alternate text  and use of headings. Explore the Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web document at  http:  www.w3.org WAI mobile  .  Explore  related  links  that  interest  you.  Write  a  one-page, double-spaced summary that describes areas of overlap and how web developers can  support both accessibility and mobile devices.  Focus on Web Design  Take a few moments and visit the CSS Zen Garden at http:  www.csszengarden.com .  Explore the site and note the widely diff erent designs.

In  this chapter, you’ll become familiar with coding HTML tables to organize infor-  mation on a web page.  329  330  8.1  Chapter 8 Tables  Table Overview   The purpose of a table is to organize information. In the past, before CSS was well sup-  ported by browsers, tables were also used to format web page layouts. An HTML table is  composed of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet. Each individual table cell is at the  VideoNote    tag.    tag.  a   tag.

HTML for this table is         Name    Birthday    Phone                Jack    5 13    857-555-5555    Sparky    11 28    303-555-5555         Notice how the table is coded row by row. Also, each row is coded cell by cell. This  attention to detail is crucial for the successful use of tables. An example can be found  in the student files  chapter8 table1.html .  Table Element  Table elements are block display elements that contain tabular information. The table  begins  with  a   tag  and  ends  with  a   tag.  See  Table  8.1  for  the  common attributes of the table element.   Table 8.1 Commonly used attributes of the table element  8.1 Table Overview  331  Attribute  Value  Purpose  align  bgcolor  Valid color value  border  0  1–100  cellpadding  Numeric value  cellspacing  Numeric value  left  default , right , center  Horizontal alignment of the table  obsolete in HTML5   Background color of the table  obsolete in HTML5   Default; there is no visible border  obsolete in HTML5   Visible border with pixel width specified  Specifies the number of pixels of padding between the content of a table  cell and its border  obsolete in HTML5   Specifies the number of pixels of space between the borders of each cell  in a table  obsolete in HTML5   summary  Text description  Provides accessibility with a text description that gives an overview of and  the context for the information in the table  at the time this was written,  the summary attribute was obsolete in HTML5, but efforts were underway  for reinstatement; check the textbook website for further information   title  Text description  A brief text description that provides an overview of the table; may be  displayed by some browsers as a tooltip  width  Numeric value or percentage  Specifies the width of the table  obsolete in HTML5   Table Captions   The caption element is often used with a data table to describe its  contents. The caption begins with a    tag and ends with a    tag. The text contained within the caption element displays  on the web page above the table, although you’ll see later in the chapter  that you can configure the placement with CSS. The table shown in  Figure 8.2 uses the caption element to set the table caption to “Bird  Sightings”. Notice that the caption element is coded on the line imme-  diately after the opening   tag. An example can be found in the  Figure 8.2 The caption for this table is  student files  chapter8 table2.html . The HTML for the table is  “Bird Sightings”      Bird Sightings    Name    Date    Bobolink    5 25 10                   Upland Sandpiper    6 03 10         332  8.2  Chapter 8 Tables  Table Rows, Cells, and Headers  Table Row Element  Attribute  Value  Purpose  align  The table row element configures a row within a table on a web page. The table row  begins with a   tag and ends with a   tag. See Table 8.2 for common attributes of the table row element.  Table 8.2 Commonly used attributes of the table row element   The table data element configures a cell within a row in a table on a web page. The  table  cell  begins  with  a   tag  and  ends  with  a   tag.  See  Table  8.3  for  common attributes of the table data cell element.

Its purpose  is to configure column and row headings. Text displayed within a  table header element is centered and bold. The table header ele-  Figure 8.3 Using    tags to indicate column  ment begins with a   tag and ends with a    tag. See Table  headings  8.3 for common attributes of the table data cell element.

Notice that the first row uses   instead of   tags.  8.2 Table Rows, Cells, and Headers  333                     Name    Birthday    Phone    Jack    5 13    857-555-5555    Sparky    11 28    303-555-5555         Hands-On Practice 8.1   In this Hands-On Practice, you will create a web page similar to Figure 8.4 that describes two  schools you have attended. Use the caption “School History Table.” The table has three rows and  three  columns.  The  fi  rst  row  will  have  table  header  elements  with  the  headings  School Attended,  Years,  and  Degree  Awarded.  You  will  complete  the  second  and  third  rows  with  your  own informa-  tion within table data elements.  To get started, launch a text editor and open chapter2 template.html in the student files. Save  the file as mytable.html. Modify the title element. Use table, table row, table header, table data,  and caption elements to configure a table similar to Figure 8.4 .  Figure 8.4 School  History Table  Hints:    tag.  ● The table has three rows and three columns.  ● To confi gure a border, use border="1" on the   tag.  ● To eliminate space between the cell borders, use cellspacing="0" on the  ● To confi gure padding within each cell, use cellpadding="5" on the   tag.  ● Use the table header element for the cells in the fi rst row.  334  Chapter 8 Tables  A sample solution is found in the student files  chapter8 table4.html . Your HTML5 code will not  pass W3C validation testing when using obsolete attributes such as border , cellspacing ,  and cellpadding . This chapter introduces these obsolete attributes because they are still valid  in XHTML and are still used often on the Web. Don’t worry, you’ll get practice configuring a table  with CSS properties later in the chapter.  8.3  Span Rows and Columns  You can alter the gridlike look of a table by applying the colspan and rowspan attributes  to table data or table header elements. As you get into more complex table configurations  like these, be sure to sketch the table on paper before you start typing the HTML.  The colspan Attribute  The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns that a cell will occupy.  Figure 8.5 shows a table cell that spans two columns.

To  create  the  web page  shown in Figure 8.7 , launch a text editor and open chapter2 template.html in the student fi les.  Save the fi le as myrowspan.html. Modify the title element. Use table, table row, table head, and  table data elements to confi gure the table.  Figure 8.7  Practice with the  rowspan attribute  1. Code the opening   tag. Confi gure a border with border="1" , eliminate space  between the cell borders with cellspacing="0" , and confi gure padding within each cell  with cellpadding="5" .  2. Begin the fi rst row with a   tag.  3. The table data cell with “Cana Island Lighthouse” spans three rows. Code a table data  element. Use the rowspan="3" attribute.  4. Code a table data element that contains the text “Built: 1869”.  5. End the fi rst row with a   tag.  6. Begin the second row with a   tag. This row will only have one table data element  because the cell in the fi rst column is already reserved for “Cana Island Lighthouse”.  7. Code a table data element that contains the text “Automated: 1944”.  8. End the second row with a   tag.  9. Begin the third row with a   tag. This row will only have one table data element because  the cell in the fi rst column is already reserved for “Cana Island Lighthouse”.  10. Code a table data element that contains the text “Tower Height: 65 feet”.  11. End the third row with a   tag.  12. Code the closing   tag.  Save the file and view it in a browser. A sample solution is found in the student files   chapter8 table6.html . The use of the border , cellpadding , and cellspacing attributes  will cause your web page to fail HTML5 validation. However, these attributes are still valid in  XHTML syntax. Notice how the “Cana Island Lighthouse” text is vertically aligned in the middle  of the cell, which is the default vertical alignment. You can modify the vertical alignment using  the valign attribute on the td element. While this example uses HTML attributes, the modern  approach is to configure tables using CSS, which you’ll explore later in this chapter.  336  8.4  Chapter 8 Tables   Configure an Accessible Table  Tables can be useful to organize information on a web page, but what if you couldn’t  see the table and were relying on assistive technology like a screen reader to read the  Focus on  Accessibility  table to you? You’d hear the contents of the table just the way it is coded—row by row,  cell by cell. This might be difficult to understand. This section discusses  coding techniques to improve the accessibility of tables.  For a simple informational data table like the one shown in Figure 8.8 ,  the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative  WAI  Web Content Accessibility  Guidelines 2.0  WCAG 2.0  recommend the following:  ● Use table header elements     tags  to indicate column or  ● Use the caption element to provide a text title or caption for  An example web page is in the student files  chapter8 table7.html . The HTML is  row headings.  Figure 8.8 This simple data table  uses   tags and the caption  the table.  element to provide accessibility      Bird Sightings    Name    Date    Bobolink    5 25 10                   Upland Sandpiper    6 03 10             Bird Sightings    Name    Date         However, for more complex tables, the W3C recommends specifically associating the table  data cell values with their corresponding headers. The technique that is recommended  uses the id attribute  usually in a   tag  to identify a specific header cell and the  headers attribute in a   tag. The code to configure the table in Figure 8.8 using  headers and ids is as follows  also see chapter8 table8.html in the student files :    Bobolink    5 25 10         8.4 Configure an Accessible Table   Upland Sandpiper    6 03 10   337           Focus on  Accessibility  FAQ What about the summary attribute?  At  the  time  this  was  written,  the  summary  attribute  was  deemed  obsolete  in  HTML5,  but efforts  were  underway  for  reinstatement.  Check  the  textbook  website  for  further  information.  The summary  attribute  was  used  for  many  years  and  is  still  valid  in  XHTML.  The  purpose  of  coding  a summary  attribute on a table element is to provide an overview of the purpose and organization of the  table,  setting  the  context  for  the  information  in  the  table.  The  information  in  the  summary attribute  is  available  to  screen  readers  but  does  not  display  in  the  browser  viewport. An  example  of using  the summary attribute for the table shown in Figure 8.8 follows:  <table border="1" summary="A list of bird sightings with one bird  listed in each row. The first column contains the name of the bird.  The second column contains the date the bird was identified.">  New for the HTML5 specification, W3C suggests the following techniques to provide context  for the information in a table: Configure descriptive text in the caption element, provide an  explanatory paragraph directly on the web page, or simplify the table.   Focus on  Accessibility  FAQ What about the scope attribute?  The scope attribute specifies the association of table cells and table row or column headers. It  is used to indicate whether a table cell is a header for a column   scope="col"   or row    scope="row"  . An example of the code for the table in Figure 8.8 that uses this attribute is  as follows  also see chapter8 table9.html in the student files :      Bird Sightings    Name    Date                   Bobolink    5 25 10    Upland Sandpiper    6 03 10         338  Chapter 8 Tables  As you reviewed the code sample in the previous page, you may have noticed that using the  scope attribute to provide accessibility requires less coding than implementing the headers  and id attributes. However, because of inconsistent screen reader support of the scope  attribute, the WCAG 2.0 recommendations for coding techniques encourage the use of  headers and id attributes rather than the scope attribute.  Checkpoint 8.1  1. What is the purpose of using a table on a web page?  2. What is the difference between the cellpadding and cellspacing table attributes?  3. Describe one coding technique that increases the accessibility of an HTML table.  8.5  Style a Table with CSS  Back in the day, it was common practice to configure the visual aesthetic of a table with  HTML attributes. A more modern approach is to use CSS to style a table. In this section,  you’ll explore using CSS to style the border, padding, alignment, width, height, vertical  alignment, and background of table elements. Table 8.4 lists corresponding CSS proper-  ties with the HTML attributes used to style tables.  Table 8.4 CSS properties used to style tables   HTML Attribute  CSS Property  align  width  width  height  height  cellpadding  padding  cellspacing  bgcolor  valign  background-color  background-image  border  none  none  and bottom  To align a table, configure the width and margin properties for the table selector.  For example, to center a table, use  table { width: 75%;  margin: auto; }  To align items within table cells, use text-align  border-spacing ; a numeric value  px or em  or percentage. If you set a value to 0,  omit the unit. One numeric value with unit  px or em  configures both horizontal and  vertical spacing. Two numeric values with unit  px or em : The first value configures  the horizontal spacing and the second value configures the vertical spacing.  border-collapse configures the border area. The values are separate  default   and collapse . Use border-collapse: collapse; to remove extra space  between table and table cell borders.  vertical-align specifies the vertical placement of content.

Create a folder named ch8table. Copy the starter.html fi le from the chapter8  folder to your ch8table folder. We’ll use embedded styles for ease of editing and testing your  page. Open the starter.html fi le in a browser. The display should look similar to the one shown  in Figure 8.9 .  Figure 8.9 This table is confi gured with HTML  Launch a text editor and open starter.html from your ch8table folder.  1. Review the web page code and notice the attributes on the   tag that confi gure  the border, width, alignment, cell padding, and cell spacing of the table. Delete these  attributes from the   tag. You will code embedded CSS style rules to replace  their functions.  2. Confi gure the table element selector. Locate the embedded styles in the head section of the  web page. Add a style rule for the table element selector in this area that confi gures the table  to be centered, have a border, and have a width of 600px.  table { margin: auto;  border: 1px solid 5c743d;  width: 600px; }  td, th { border: 1px solid 5c743d;  padding: 5px;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }  Save the fi le as menu.html. Open your page in a browser. Notice that there is a border  surrounding the entire table but not surrounding each table cell.  3. Confi gure the td and th element selectors. Add a style rule that confi gures a border and  padding. Confi gure these selectors to use Arial or the default sans-serif font typeface.  Save the fi le and open your page in a browser. Each table cell should now be outlined with a  border and should display text in a sans-serif font.   340  Chapter 8 Tables  a browser.  as follows:  4. Notice the empty space between the borders of the table cells. The border-spacing  property can be used to eliminate this space. Add a border-spacing: 0;  declaration to the table element selector. Save the fi le and open your page in  5. Confi gure the caption to be displayed with Verdana or the default sans-serif font typeface,  bold font weight, 1.2em font size, and 5 pixels of bottom padding. Confi gure a style rule  caption { font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;  font-weight: bold;  font-size: 1.2em;  padding-bottom: 5px; }  The new style rule for the cells is  td, th { padding: 5px;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }  6. Let’s experiment and confi gure background colors for the rows instead of cell borders.  Modify the style rule for the td and th element selectors and remove the border declaration.  7. Create a new class called altrow that sets a background color.  .altrow { background-color: eaeaea; }  8. Modify the   tags in the HTML. Assign the second and fourth   tags to the altrow  class. Save the fi le and open your page in a browser. The table area should look similar to the  one shown in Figure 8.10 .  Figure 8.10 Rows are confi gured with alternating background colors  Notice how the background color of the alternate rows adds subtle interest to the web page.  Compare your work with the sample in the student files  chapter8 menu.html . In this Hands- On  Practice, you configured the display of an HTML table using CSS. You’ll see this coding  technique used increasingly in the future.   8.6 CSS3 Structural Pseudo-Classes  341  FAQ Is there a way to create a table-like page layout with CSS?  Yes, if you’d like to explore using CSS to style table-like layouts on web pages, check out the CSS  display property. As you may recall from previous chapters, the CSS display property config-  ures whether and how an element is displayed. You’ve already worked with display: none ,  display: block , and display: inline . Internet Explorer 8 was the last major browser to  add support for the display: table property values. Rachel Andrew’s article, “Everything You  Know  web.com articles everything_you_know_about_  About   CSS   Is   Wrong”       http:  www.digital-  CSS_Is_wrong  , encourages developers to embrace the display: table coding methods.  Be aware that this technique is still quite limited. For example, there is no built-in mechanism to  emulate the rowspan or colspan attribute in HTML tables. However, this is in the works with  the CSS3 draft recommendation at http:  www.w3.org Style CSS current-work , which includes new CSS specifications for working with multicolumn layouts and grid positioning.  8.6  CSS3 Structural Pseudo-Classes  In the previous section, you configured CSS and applied a class to every other table row to  configure alternating background colors, often referred to as “zebra striping.” You may have  found this to be a bit inconvenient and wondered if there was a more efficient method. Well,  there is! CSS3 structural pseudo-class selectors allow you to select and apply classes to  elements based on their position in the structure of the document, such as every other  row. CSS3 pseudo-classes are supported by current versions of Firefox, Opera, Chrome,  Safari, and Internet Explorer 9. Earlier versions of Internet Explorer do not support CSS3  pseudo-classes, so consider using this coding technique only for enhancements to a web  page. Table 8.5 lists common CSS3 structural pseudo-class selectors and their purpose.  Table 8.5 Common CSS3 structural pseudo-classes  Pseudo-Class  Purpose  :first-of-type  :first-child  :last-of-type  :last-child  Applies to the first element of the specified type  Applies to the first child of an element  CSS2 selector   Applies to the last element of the specified type  Applies to the last child of an element  :nth-of-type n   Applies to the “nth” element of the specified type  Values: a number, odd , or even  To apply a pseudo-class, write it after the selector. The following code sample will  configure the first item in an unordered list to display with red text.   li:first-of-type { color: FF0000; }  Hands-On Practice 8.4  In this Hands-On Practice, you will rework the table you confi gured in Hands-On Practice 8.3 to  use CSS3 structural pseudo-class selectors to confi gure color.  1. Launch a text editor and open menu.html in your ch8table folder  it can also be found as  chapter8 menu.html in the student fi les . Save the fi le as menu2.html.  342  Chapter 8 Tables  2. View the source code and notice that the second and fourth tr elements are assigned to the  altrow class. You won’t need this class assignment when using CSS3 structural pseudo-  class selectors. Delete class="altrow" from the tr elements.  3. Examine the embedded CSS and locate the altrow class. Change the selector to use a  structural pseudo-class that will apply the style to the even-numbered table rows. Replace  .altrow with tr:nth-of-type  even  as shown in the following CSS declaration:  tr:nth-of-type even  { background-color: eaeaea; }  4. Save the fi le and open your page in a browser. The table area should look similar to the one  shown in Figure 8.10 if you are using a modern browser that supports CSS3 structural  pseudo-classes.  5. Let’s confi gure the fi rst row to have a dark-gray background  666  and light-gray text   eaeaea  with the :first-of-type structural pseudo-class. Add the following to the  tr:first-of-type { background-color: 666;  embedded CSS:  color: eaeaea; }  6. Save the fi le and open your page in a browser. The table area should look similar to the one  shown in Figure 8.11 if you are using a modern browser that supports CSS3 structural  pseudo-classes. A sample solution is available in the student fi les  chapter8 menucss.html .  Figure 8.11 CSS3 pseudo-class selectors style the table rows  CSS structural pseudo-classes are convenient to use, but be aware that Internet Explorer 8 and  earlier versions do not support this technology. Although browser support will increase in the  future, today it’s best to apply these pseudo-classes with progressive enhancement in mind.  8.7  Configure Table Sections  There are a lot of configuration options for coding tables. Table rows can be put together   into three types of groups: table head with   , table body with   , and  table footer with   .  These groups can be useful when you need to configure the areas in the table in differ-  ent ways, using either attributes or CSS. The   tag is required if you configure a    or   area, although you can omit either the table head or table footer if  8.7 Configure Table Sections  343  you like. When you use table row groups, the   and    sections must be coded before the   section to  pass W3C XHTML validation. The code sample in this section uses  HTML5 syntax with the   coded after the   , which is  more intuitive.  The following code sample  see chapter8 tfoot.html in the student  files  configures the table shown in Figure 8.12 and demonstrates  the use of CSS to configure a table head, table body, and table  footer with different styles.  The CSS styles a centered 200-pixel-wide table with a caption that  is rendered in large, bold font; a table head section with a light-  gray  eaeaea  background color; a table body section styled with  Figure 8.12 CSS confi gures the thead,  slightly smaller text  .90em  using Arial or sans-serif font; table  tbody, and tfoot element selectors  body td element selectors set to display with some left padding  and a dashed bottom border; and a table footer section that has centered,  bold text and a light-gray background color  eaeaea . The CSS code is  table { width: 200px;  margin: auto; }  caption { font-size: 2em;  font-weight: bold; }  thead { background-color: eaeaea; }  tbody { font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  font-size: .90em; }  tbody td { border-bottom: 1px 000033 dashed;  padding-left: 25px; }  tfoot { background-color: eaeaea;   font-weight: bold;  text-align: center; }  The HTML for the table is   Time Sheet    Day    Hours                         Monday    4    Tuesday    3            344                                   Chapter 8 Tables   Wednesday    5    Thursday    3    Friday    3    Total    18       This example demonstrates the power of CSS in styling documents. The   tags  within each table row group element selector  thead, tbody, and tfoot  inherited the  font styles configured for their parent group element selector. Notice how a contextual  selector configures the padding and border only for   tags that are contained within   actually, “children of”  the   element. Sample code is located in the student  files  chapter8 tfoot.html . Take a few moments to explore the web page code and  open the page in a browser.  Checkpoint 8.2  1.

They are  used by search engines to accept keywords and by online stores to process  e-commerce shopping carts. Websites use forms to help with a variety of func-   tions, including accepting visitor feedback, encouraging visitors to send a news  story to a friend or colleague, collecting e-mail addresses for a newsletter, and  accepting order information. This chapter introduces a very powerful tool for  web developers—forms that accept information from web page visitors.  357  358  9.1  Chapter 9 Forms  Overview of Forms  Figure 9.1 The  search form on  Google’s home  page  Every time you use a search engine, place an order, or join an online mailing list, you  use a form . A form is an HTML element that contains and organizes objects called form  controls , including text boxes, check boxes, and buttons, that can accept information  from website visitors.  For example, look at Google’s search form shown in Figure 9.1 . You may have used this  many times but never thought about how it works. The form is quite simple; it contains  just two form controls: the text box that accepts the keywords used in the search and  the search button that submits the form and gets the search started.  Figure 9.2 shows a more detailed form that is used to enter shipping information at the   IRS website   http:  www.irs.gov  . This form contains text boxes to accept information  such as name and address. Select lists  sometimes called drop-down boxes  are used to  capture information with a limited number of correct values, such as state and country  information. When a visitor clicks the continue button, the form information is submitted  and the ordering process continues. Whether a form is used to search for web pages or to  order a publication, the form alone cannot do all of the  processing. The form needs to invoke a program or script  on the web server in order to search a database or record  an order. There are usually two components of a form:  1. The HTML form itself, which is the web page user  interface  2. The server-side processing, which works with the  form data and sends e-mail, writes to a text file,  updates a database, or performs some other type  of processing on the server  Form Element  Now that you have a basic understanding of what forms  do, let’s focus on the HTML code to create a form. The  Figure 9.2 This form accepts order information  form element contains a form on a web page. The  9.1 Overview of Forms  359    tag specifies the beginning of a form area. The closing   tag specifies the  end of a form area. There can be multiple forms on a web page, but they cannot be nested  inside one another. The form element can be configured with attributes that specify which  server-side program or file will process the form, how the form information will be sent to  the server, and the name of the form.

Form controls are  the objects that accept the information. Types of form controls include text boxes,  scrolling text boxes, select lists, radio buttons, check boxes, and buttons. HTML5 offers  new form controls, including those that are customized for e-mail addresses, URLs,  dates, times, numbers, and even date selection. HTML elements that configure form  controls will be introduced in the following sections.   360  9.2  Chapter 9 Forms  Input Element Form Controls  The input element is a stand-alone tag that is used to configure several different types  of form controls. The input element is coded as   when using HTML5 syntax and  as   when using XHTML syntax. Use the type attribute to specify the type of  form control that the browser should display.  Text Box  The   tag with type="text" configures a text box. The  text box form control accepts text or numeric information such  as names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other text.  Common input element attributes for text boxes are listed in  Figure 9.3 The    tag with  type="text" confi gures this form element  Table 9.2 . A sample text box is shown in Figure 9.3 .  The code for the text box is shown below:  E-mail:    Table 9.2 Common text box attributes  Attribute  Value  Purpose  type  text  name  Configures a text box  Alphanumeric, no spaces,  begins with a letter  should be unique  id  Alphanumeric, no spaces,  begins with a letter  size  Numeric value  Names the form element so that it can be easily accessed by client-side  scripting languages  such as JavaScript  or by server-side processing; the name  Provides a unique identifier for the form element  Configures the width of the text box as displayed by the browser; if size is  omitted, the browser displays the text box with its own default size   maxlength  Numeric value  value  Text or numeric characters  Configures the maximum length of data accepted by the text box  Assigns an initial value to the text box that is displayed by the browser; accepts  information typed in the text box; this value can be accessed by client-side  scripting languages and by server-side processing  Form control is disabled  Form control is for display; cannot be edited  autocomplete  disabled  disabled  readonly  readonly  on  off  list  autofocus  autofocus  HTML5 attribute; default; browser will use autocomplete to fill the form control  HTML5 attribute; browser will not use autocomplete to fill the form control  HTML5 attribute; browser places cursor in the form control and sets the focus  HTML5 attribute; associates the form control with a datalist element  HTML5 attribute; brief information intended to assist the user  Datalist element id value  placeholder  Text or numeric characters  required  required  accesskey  Keyboard character  tabindex  Numeric value  Configures a hot key for the form control  HTML5 attribute; browser verifies entry of information before submitting the form  Configures the tab order of the form control  Several attributes are new in HTML5. The new required attribute is exciting because it  will cause supporting browsers to perform form validation. Browsers that support the  HTML5 required attribute will automatically verify that information has been entered in the  text box and display an error message when the condition is not met. A code sample is   9.2 Input Element Form Controls  361  E-mail: <input type="text" name="email" id="email"  required="required">  Figure 9.4 shows an error message automatically generated  by Firefox 4 that is displayed after the user clicked the  form’s submit button without entering information in the re-  quired text box. Browsers that do not support HTML5 or the  required attribute will ignore the attribute.  Although web designers are enthusiastic about the re-  quired attribute and other new form-processing functions  offered by HTML5, it will be some time before all browsers  support these new features. In the meantime, be aware  that verification and validation of form information also  must be done the old-fashioned way—with client-side or  Figure 9.4 The Firefox 4 browser displayed an error  server-side scripting.  message  FAQ Why use both the name and id attributes on form controls?  The name attribute names the form element so that it can be easily accessed by client-side  scripting languages such as JavaScript or by server-side processing languages such as PHP.  The value given to a name attribute for a form element should be unique for that form. The id  attribute is included for use with CSS and scripting. The value of the id attribute should be  unique to the entire web page document that contains the form. Typically, the values assigned  to the name and id attributes on a particular form element are the same.  Submit Button   The submit button form control is used to submit the form. When clicked, it triggers the  action method on the form element and causes the browser to send the form data  the  name and value pairs for each form control  to the web server. The web server will in-  voke the server-side processing program or script listed on the form’s action property.  The input element with type="submit" configures a submit button. For example,     Reset Button  The reset button form control is used to reset the form fields to their initial  values. A reset button does not submit the form.  The input element with type="reset" configures a reset button. For example,  A form with a text box, a submit button, and a reset button is shown in     Figure 9.5 .  Figure 9.5 This form contains a  text box, a submit button, and a  reset button  Common attributes for submit buttons and reset buttons are listed in Table 9.3 .

To get started, launch a text editor and open  chapter2 template.html in the student fi les. Save the fi le as form1.html. You will create a web  page with a form similar to the example in Figure 9.6 .  Figure 9.6 The text on the submit  button says “Sign Me Up!”  1. Modify the title element to display the text “Form Example”.  2. Confi gure an h1 element with the text “Join Our Newsletter”.  You are ready to confi gure the form area. A form begins with the form element. Insert a blank  line under the heading you just added and type in a   tag as follows:     In your fi rst form, we are using the minimal HTML needed to create the form; we’ll begin  working with the action attribute later in the chapter.  3. To create the form control for the visitor’s e-mail address to be entered, type the following  code on a blank line below the form element:  E-mail:      9.2 Input Element Form Controls  363  This places the text “E-mail:” in front of the text box used to enter the visitor’s e-mail  address. The input element has a type attribute with the value of text that causes the  browser to display a text box. The name attribute assigns the name e-mail to the   information entered into the text box  the value   and could be used by server-side  processing. The id attribute uniquely identifi es the element on the page. The    elements confi gure line breaks.  4. Now you are ready to add the submit button to the form on the next line. Add a value  attribute set to “Sign Me Up!”:     This causes the browser to display a button with “Sign Me Up!” instead of the default value of  “Submit Query”.  5. Add a blank space after the submit button and code a reset button:     6. Next, code the closing form tag:     in Figure 9.6 .  Save form1.html and test your web page in a browser. It should look similar to the page shown  You can compare your work with the solution found in the student files  chapter9 form1.html .  Try entering some information into your form. Try clicking the submit button. Don’t worry if  the form redisplays but nothing seems to happen when you click the button—you haven’t  configured this form to work with any server-side processing. Connecting forms to server-side  processing is demonstrated later in this chapter. The next sections will introduce you to  more form controls.  Check Box  The check box form control allows the user to select one or more  of a group of predetermined items. The input element with  type="checkbox" configures a check box. Common check box  attributes are listed in Table 9.4 .  Figure 9.7 shows an example with several check boxes. Note  that more than one check box can be selected by the user.  The HTML is  Figure 9.7 Sample check box  Choose the browsers you use:       Internet Explorer         Firefox   Opera   364  Chapter 9 Forms   Table 9.4 Common check box attributes  Attribute  Value  Purpose  type  checkbox  name  Configures a check box  Alphanumeric, no spaces,  Names the form element so that it can be easily  begins with a letter  accessed by client-side scripting languages  such as  JavaScript  or by server-side processing; the name  Provides a unique identifier for the form element  Configures the check box to be checked by default when  Assigns a value to the check box that is triggered when the  check box is checked; this value can be accessed by client-  side and server-side processing  Form control is disabled  Form control is for display; cannot be edited  HTML5 attribute; browser places cursor in the form control  should be unique  id  Alphanumeric, no spaces,  begins with a letter  checked  checked  displayed by the browser  value  Text or numeric  characters  disabled  disabled  readonly  readonly  autofocus  autofocus  and sets the focus  required  required  submitting the form  accesskey  Keyboard character  HTML5 attribute; browser verifies entry of information before  Configures a hot key for the form control   tabindex  Numeric value  Radio Button  Configures the tab order of the form control  The radio button form control allows the user to select exactly one  and  only one  choice from a group of predetermined items. Each radio button  in a group is given the same name attribute and a unique value attribute.  Because the name attribute is the same, the elements are identified as  part of a group by the browsers and only one may be selected.  The input element with type="radio" configures a radio button.  Figure 9.8 shows an example with a radio button group. Note that  Figure 9.8 Use radio buttons when only  one choice is an appropriate response  only one radio button can be selected at a time by the user. Common  radio button attributes are listed in Table 9.5 . The HTML is  Select your favorite browser:     Internet        Notice that all the name attributes have the same value: favbrowser .

The input element with type="password" configures a pass-  word box. When the user types information in a password box,  asterisks  or another symbol, depending on the browser  are  displayed instead of the characters that have been typed, as  shown in Figure 9.9 .

Connecting forms to server-side processing is  demonstrated later in this chapter.  FAQ How can I send form information in an e-mail?  Forms usually need to invoke some type of server-side processing to perform functions such  as sending e-mail, writing to text files, updating databases, and so on. Another option is to set  up a form to send information using the e-mail program configured to work with the web page  visitor’s browser. In what is sometimes called using a mailto: URL, the   tag is coded to  use your e-mail address in the action attribute:     9.4 Select List  369  When a form is used in this manner, the web visitor will see a warning message. The warning  message presents a nonprofessional image and is not the best way to inspire trust and confi-  dence in your website or business.  Be aware that information sent in e-mail messages is not secure. Sensitive information, such as  credit card numbers, should not be transmitted using e-mail. See Chapter 12 for information  about using encryption to transmit data securely.  There are other reasons not to use mailto: URL. For example, when people share a computer,  they may not be using the default e-mail application. In this case, filling out the form is a waste  of  time.  Even  if  the  person  using  the  computer  also  uses  the  default  e-mail  application, perhaps  he or she may not want to divulge this particular e-mail address. Perhaps they have another e-  mail address that is used for forms and newsletters, and do not want to waste time filling out  your form. In either case, the result is an unhappy website visitor. So, while using mailto: URL is  easy, it does not always create the most usable web form for your visitors. What’s a web de-  veloper to do? Use server-side processing  see Hands-On Practice 9.5  to handle form data in-  T he select list form control shown in Figures 9.12 and 9.13 is also known by several other names, including select box, drop-down list, drop-down box, and option box.  A select list is configured with one select element and multiple option elements.  The select element contains and configures the select list form control. The    tag denotes the beginning of the select list. The closing   tag denotes the end  of the select list. Attributes configure the number of options to display and whether  more than one option item may be selected. Common attributes for select elements are  listed in Table 9.8 .

You are designing a website for a client who sells items in a retail store. They want to cre-  ate a customer list for e-mail marketing purposes. Your client sells to consumers and needs  a form that accepts a customer’s name and e-mail address. Would you recommend using  two input boxes  one for the name and one for the e-mail  or three input boxes  one each  for the first name, last name, and e-mail address ? Explain your answer.  2. A question on a survey asks participants to indicate their favorite browsers. Most people will  select more than one response. What type of form control would you use to configure this  question on the web page? Explain your answer.  3. True or False? In a radio button group, the value attribute is used by the browser to pro-  cess the separate radio buttons as a group.  9.5  Image Buttons and the Button Element  As you have worked with forms in this chapter, you may have noticed that the standard  submit button  see Figure 9.11   is a little plain. You can make the form control that visitors  select to submit the form a bit more compelling and visually interesting in two ways:  1. Configure an image with the input element.  2. Create a custom image that is configured with the button element.  Image Button  Figure 9.14 shows an image used in place of the standard  submit button. This is called an image button . When an  image button is clicked or tapped, the form is submitted.  The image button is coded using the   tag  along with type="image" and a src attribute with the  value of the name of the image file. For example, to use  Figure 9.14 The web page visitor will select the  the image called login.gif as an image button, the  image button to submit the form  HTML code is      Button Element  Another way to add more interest to a form is to use the but-  ton element , which can be used to configure not only images  but also blocks of text as the selectable area that can submit  or reset a form. Any web page content that is between the    and   tags is configured to be part of the  button. Common attributes for button elements are listed in  Table 9.10 .

In this section, you’ll explore techniques to increase the accessibility of form controls,  including the label element, fieldset element, legend element, tabindex attribute,  and accesskey attribute, which make it easier for individuals with vision and mobility  challenges to use your form pages. The use of label, fieldset, and legend elements may  increase the readability and usability of the web form for all visitors.  The label element is a container tag that associates a text description with a form con-  trol. This is helpful to visually challenged individuals who are using assistive technology  such as a screen reader to match up the text descriptions on forms with their corre-  sponding form controls. The label element also benefits individuals who have difficulty  with fine motor control. Clicking anywhere on either a form control or its associated text  label will set the cursor focus to the form control.  There are two different methods to associate a label with a form control.  1. The first method places the label element as a container around both the text de-  scription and the HTML form element. Notice that both the text label and the form  control must be adjacent elements. The code is   E-mail:     9.6 Accessibility and Forms  373  2. The second method uses the for attribute to associate the label with a particular  HTML form element. This is more flexible and is does not require the text label  and the form control to be adjacent. The code is   E-mail:        Notice that the value of the for attribute on the label element is the same as the  value of the id attribute on the input element. This creates the association between  the text label and the form control. The input element uses both the name and id  attributes for different purposes. The name attribute can be used by client-side  scripting and server-side processing. The id attribute creates an identifier that  can be used by the label element, anchor element, and CSS selectors. The label  element does not display on the web page—it works behind the scenes to provide  for accessibility.  Hands-On Practice 9.3  the fi le as form3.html.  as follows:  id="fname">   form controls.  In this Hands-On Practice, you will add the label element to the text box and scrolling text  area form controls on the form you created in Hands-On Practice 9.2  see Figure 9.11   as a  starting point. Launch a text editor and open chapter9 form2.html in the student fi les. Save  1. Locate the text box for the fi rst name. Add a label element to wrap around the input tag   First Name: <input type="text" name="fname"  2. Using the method shown previously, add a label element for the last name and e-mail  3. Confi gure a label element to contain the text “Comments”. Associate the label with the  scrolling text box form control. The sample code is   Comments:    <textarea name="comments" id="comments" rows="4"  cols="40">   Save form3.html and test your web page in a browser. It should look similar to the page  shown in Figure 9.11 —the label elements do not change the way that the page displays, but  a web visitor with physical challenges should fi nd the form easier to use.  You can compare your work with the solution found in the student files  chapter9 form3.html .  Try entering some information into your form. Try clicking the submit button. Don’t worry if the  form  redisplays  but  nothing  seems  to  happen  when  you  click  the  button—you  haven’t configured  this form to work with any server-side processing. Connecting forms to server-side processing is  demonstrated later in this chapter.   374  Chapter 9 Forms  Fieldset and Legend Elements  A technique that can be used to create a more visually pleasing form is to group ele-  ments of a similar purpose together using the fieldset element , which will cause the  browser to render a visual cue, such as an outline or a border, around form elements  grouped together within the fieldset. The   tag denotes the beginning of the  grouping. The closing   tag denotes the end of the grouping.  The legend element provides a text description for the fieldset grouping. The    tag denotes the beginning of the text description. The closing   tag denotes  the end of the text description. The HTML to create the grouping shown in Figure 9.16 is      Billing Address    Street: <input type="text" name="street" id="street"  size="54">      City:      State: <input type="text" name="state" id="state" maxlength="2"   Zip: <input type="text" name="zip" id="zip" maxlength="5"  size="5">   size="5">      Figure 9.16 Form controls that are all related to a mailing address  The grouping and visual effect of the fieldset element creates an organized and appeal-  ing web page containing a form.

You may notice that when you activate the submit button, the  form redisplays. This is because there is no action property in the form element. You’ll work  with setting the action property in Section 9.8 .  5. How about a quick preview of styling a form with CSS? Figures 9.17 and 9.18 show the  same form elements, but the form in Figure 9.18 is styled with CSS, which gives it the same  functionality with increased visual appeal.

The  tabindex Attribute  Focus on  Accessibility  Some of your website visitors may have difficulty using a mouse and will access your  form with a keyboard. The Tab key can be used to move from one form control to another.  The default action for the Tab key within a form is to move to the next form control in the  order in which the form controls are coded in the web page document. This is usually  appropriate. However, if the tab order needs to be changed for a form, use the tabindex  attribute on each form control.  For each form tag     ,   , and    , code a tabindex attribute  with a numeric value, beginning with 1, 2, 3, and so on in numerical order. The HTML  code to configure the customer e-mail text box as the initial position of the cursor is     If you configure a form control with tabindex="0" , it will be visited after all of the  other form controls that are assigned a tabindex attribute. If you happen to assign two  form controls the same tabindex value, the one that is coded first in the HTML will be  You can configure the tabindex attribute for anchor tags in a similar manner.

The   Another technique that can make your form keyboard-friendly is the use of the accesskey  attribute on form controls. You can also configure the accesskey attribute on an anchor  accesskey Attribute  Focus on  Accessibility  tag. Assigning the accesskey attribute a value of one of the characters  a letter or  number  on the keyboard will create a hot key that your website visitor can press to  move the cursor immediately to a form control or hyperlink.  The method used to access this hot key varies depending on the operating system. Windows  users will press the Alt key and the character key. Mac users will press the Ctrl key and the  character key. For example, if the form shown in Figure 9.11 had the customer e-mail text  9.7 Styling a Form  377  coded with accesskey="E" , the web page visitor using Windows could press the Alt and E  keys to move the cursor immediately to the e-mail text box. The HTML code for this is     Note that you cannot rely on the browser to indicate that a character is an access key,  also called a hot key. You will have to manually code information about the hot key. A  visual cue may be helpful, such as displaying the hot key in bold or by placing a message  such as  Alt+E  after a form control or hyperlink that uses a hot key. When choosing  accesskey values, avoid combinations that are already used by the operating system   such as Alt+F to display the File menu . Testing hot keys is crucial.  Checkpoint 9.2  1. Describe the purpose of the fieldset and legend elements.  2. Describe the purpose of the accesskey attribute and how it supports accessibility.  3. When designing a form, should you use the standard submit button, an image button, or  a button tag? Are these different in the way in which they provide for accessibility? Explain  your answer.  9.7  Styling a Form   This section introduces three methods to style and  configure the display of a form—from the old-fash-  ioned  using an HTML table , transitional  using an  HTML table and CSS , to the modern  using CSS .  Table Structure  The form in Figure 9.11  from Hands-On Practice 9.2   looks a little “messy” and you might be wondering  how that can be improved. A while back, web de-  signers always used a table to configure the design  of form elements, typically placing the text labels  and form field elements in separate table data cells.  An example of this technique is shown in Figure 9.19  and is found in chapter9 formtable.html in the  Figure 9.19 The form controls are well aligned  student files.  The HTML is         First Name:              378                 Chapter 9 Forms   Last Name:         E-mail:         Comments:                                          Another approach is to organize a form with an HTML table but configure it with CSS rather  than with HTML attributes. While this is not a completely table-less design, using a table to  configure a small portion of a page that otherwise uses CSS is a method to be considered. It  would be best to reserve the use of a table for pure tabular data, such as price lists and budg-  ets. However, the purpose of this example is to show how CSS can be used to streamline even  the HTML needed by a table. Later in the chapter, you’ll explore how  to configure the layout and styling of a form with only CSS—without  using an HTML table.  Transitional Approach  Figure 9.20 shows a web page  see chapter9 formtable2.html in the  student files  with the form area coded with a table but styled with  CSS. The CSS to style the table configures table, th, and td element  selectors with properties that would otherwise be defined with  HTML attributes. The table element selector is configured with a  light-gray background color, no border, 20em width, and Arial or  sans-serif font. Recall that th elements display text as bold and cen-  tered by default. The th element selector configures normal-weight  font, right-aligned text, and top vertical alignment. Finally, the td  Figure 9.20 This page uses a table styled  with CSS  and th elements are configured with 5 pixels of padding. The CSS is  table { background-color: eaeaea;  border-style: none;  width: 20em;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }  th { font-weight: normal;  text-align: right;  vertical-align: top; }  td, th { padding: 5px; }   Because we are styling the table with CSS, the HTML border and align attributes are no  longer needed. Another HTML change is that the text label for each form control is now  contained in a th element instead of in a td element.  9.7 Styling a Form  379            Name:                                         E-mail:         Comments:   cols="20">     <textarea name="myComments" id="myComments" rows="2"        The result is more streamlined, flexible code. Further style changes  can be easily made in CSS, leaving the structure of the form’s table in-  tact. But the most flexible option of all is not using a table and relying  on CSS to configure the entire form. You’ll explore this technique next.  Style a Form with CSS  Many web developers cruise along using CSS for page layout  until they need to code a form. As discussed in a previous sec-  tion, tables have long been used to configure forms. This section  Figure 9.21 Wireframe for a form  will demonstrate a more modern approach, using CSS to style a  form layout without using an HTML table.  With this method, the CSS box model is used to create a series  of boxes, as shown in Figure 9.21 . The outermost box defines the  form area. Other boxes indicate label elements and form con-  trols. CSS is used to configure these components.  Figure 9.22 displays a web page with a form configured in this man-  ner  see chapter9 formcss.html in the student files . As you view  the following CSS and HTML, note that the label element selector is  configured with block display, a 100 pixel width, and floats to the  left side of the form, and clears any previous left floats. The input  and textarea elements have a top margin and are also configured  with block display. The submit button is assigned to an id with a  left margin. The styles result in a well-aligned form.  Figure 9.22 This form is confi gured with CSS  form { background-color:eaeaea;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  380  Chapter 9 Forms  The CSS is  width: 350px;  padding: 10px; }  label { fl oat: left;  width: 100px;  display: block;  clear: left;  text-align: right;  padding-right: 10px;  margin-top: 10px; }  input, textarea { margin-top: 10px;  display: block; }  mySubmit { margin-left: 110px; }  The HTML code is      Name:        E-mail:       Comments:   <textarea name="myComments" id="myComments" rows="2"  cols="20">         This section provided you with a method to style a form with CSS. Testing the way that  different browsers render the form is crucial.  As you’ve coded and displayed the forms in this chapter, you may have noticed that when  you click the submit button, the form just redisplays—the form doesn’t do anything. This  is because there is no action attribute in the   tag. The next section focuses on the  second component of using forms on web pages—server-side processing.  9.8  Server-Side Processing  Your web browser requests web pages and their related files from a web server. The web  server locates the files and sends them to your web browser. Then the web browser  renders the returned files and displays the requested web pages. Figure 9.23 illustrates  the communication between the web browser and the web server.  Sometimes a website needs more functionality than static web pages, possibly a site  search, order form, e-mail list, database display, or other type of interactive, dynamic  processing. This is when server-side processing is needed. Early web servers used a pro-  tocol called Common Gateway Interface  CGI  to provide this functionality. CGI is a  protocol, or standard method, for a web server to pass a web page user’s request  which  9.8 Server-Side Processing  381  Figure 9.23 The  web browser   client   communicates  with the web  server   is typically initiated through the use of a form  to an application program and to accept  information to send to the user. The web server typically passes the form information to  a small application program that is run by the operating system and that processes the  data, usually sending back a confirmation web page or message. Perl and C are popular  programming languages for CGI applications.  Server-side scripting is a technology by which a server-side script is run on a web server to  dynamically generate web pages. Examples of server-side scripting technologies include PHP,  Ruby on Rails, Microsoft Active Server Pages, Adobe ColdFusion, Sun JavaServer Pages, and  Microsoft .NET. Server-side scripting differs from CGI in that it uses direct execution : The  script is run either by the web server itself or by an extension module to the web server.  A web page invokes server-side processing by either an attribute on a form or by a hy-  perlink  the URL of the script is used . Any form data that exists is passed to the script.  The script completes its processing and may generate a confirmation or response web  page with the requested information. When invoking a server-side script, the web devel-  oper and the server-side programmer must communicate about the form  method attri-  bute   get or post  , form  action attribute  the URL of the server-side script , and any  special form element control s  expected by the server-side script.  The method attribute is used on the form tag to indicate the way in which the name and  value pairs should be passed to the server. The method attribute value of get causes  the form data to be appended to the URL, which is easily visible and not secure. The  method attribute value of post does not pass the form information in the URL; it passes  it in the entity body of the HTTP request, which makes it more private. The W3C recom-  mends the method =“ post ” method.  The action attribute is used on the   tag to invoke a server-side script. The name  attribute and the value attribute associated with each form control are passed to the  server-side script. The name attribute may be used as a variable name in the server-side  processing. In the next Hands-On Practice, you will invoke a server-side script from a form.  VideoNote  Connect a Form to  Server-Side Processing  Hands-On Practice 9.5  In this Hands-On Practice, you will confi gure a form to invoke a server-side script. Please note that  your  computer  must  be  connected  to  the  Internet  when  you  test  your  work.  When  using  a server-side  script,  you  will  need  to  obtain  some  information,  or  documentation,  from  the  person  or organization  providing the script. You will need to know the location of the script, whether it requires any specifi c  names for the form controls, and whether it requires any hidden form elements.   382  Chapter 9 Forms  A server-side script has been created at the author’s website     http:  webdevbasics.net scripts demo.php     for  students  to  use  for  this  exercise.  The documen-  tation for the server-side script is listed below:  ● Script URL: http:  webdevbasics.net scripts demo.php  ● Form method: post  ● Script purpose: This script will accept form input and display the form control  names and values in a web page. This is a sample script for student assignments. It  demonstrates that server-side processing has been invoked. A script used by an  actual website would perform a function such as sending an e-mail message or  updating a database.  Now you will add the configuration required to use the demo.php server-side processing with a  form. Launch a text editor and open formcss.html  see chapter9 formcss.html in the student files .  Modify the   tag by adding a method attribute with a value of “ post ” and an action  attribute with a value of “ http:  webdevbasics.net scripts demo.php ”. The HTML  code for the revised   tag is     Save your file as contact.html and test your web page in a browser. Your screen should look  similar to the one shown in Figure 9.22 . Now you are ready to test your form. You must be  connected to the Internet to test your form successfully. Enter information in the form controls  and click the submit button. You should see a confirmation page similar to the one shown in  Figure 9.24 .  Figure 9.24 The server-side script has created this web  page in response to the form  The demo.php script creates a web page that displays a message and the form information  that you entered. Where did this confirmation page originate? This confirmation page was  created by the server-side script on the action attribute in the form element.

Try these troubleshooting hints:  ● Verify that your computer is connected to the Internet.  ● Verify the spelling of the script location in the action attribute.  ● Attention to detail is crucial!  Privacy and Forms  You’ve just learned how to collect information from your website visitors. Do you  think that your visitors may want to know how you plan to use the information that  you collect? The guidelines that you develop to protect the privacy of your visitors’  information is called a privacy policy . Websites either indicate this policy on the  form page itself or create a separate page that describes the privacy policy  and  other company policies . For example, the order form page at MyMoney.gov    http:  www.mymoney.gov privacy.html   indicates the following:  “We do not give, sell or transfer personal information to third parties unless  required by law, such as the Freedom of Information Act.”  If you browse popular sites such as Amazon.com or eBay.com, you’ll find links to their privacy  policies  sometimes called a privacy notice  in the page footer area. The privacy policy  of the Better Business Bureau can be found at http:  www.bbb.org us privacy-policy .  Include a privacy notice on your site to inform your visitors how you plan to use the  information that they share with you.  Server-Side Processing Resources  Sources of Free Remote-Hosted Form Processing  If your web host provider does not support server-side processing, free remotely hosted  scripts may be an option. The script is not hosted on your server so you don’t need to  worry about installing it or whether your web host provider will support it. The disadvan-  tage is that there usually is some advertising displayed. The following are a few sites  that offer this service:  ● FormBuddy.com: http:  formbuddy.com  ● ExpressDB: http:  www.expressdb.com  ● FormMail: http:  www.formmail.com  ● Master.com: http:  www.master.com  Sources of Free Server-Side Scripts  To use free scripts, you need to have access to a web server that supports the language  used by the script. Contact your web host provider to determine what is supported. Be  aware that many free web host providers do not support server-side processing  you get  what you pay for! . The following are a few sites that offer free scripts and other resources:  ● The PHP Resource Index: http:  php.resourceindex.com  ● ASP101: http:  www.asp101.com   Many types of technologies can be used for server-side scripting, form processing, and  384  Chapter 9 Forms  ● HotScripts: http:  www.hotscripts.com  ● Matt’s Script Archive: http:  www.scriptarchive.com  ● ScriptSearch.com: http:  www.scriptsearch.com  Exploring Server-Side Processing Technologies  information sharing:  ● PHP: http:  www.php.net  ● Sun JavaServer Pages Technology:  http:  www.oracle.com technetwork java javaee jsp  ● Adobe ColdFusion and Web Applications:  http:  www.adobe.com products coldfusion  ● Ruby on Rails: http:  www.rubyonrails.org  ● Microsoft .NET: http:  www.microsoft.com net  ● Active Server Pages: http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library ms972337.aspx  Any of these technologies would be a good choice for future study.

Describe server-side processing.  2. Why is communication needed between the developer of a server-side script and the web  page designer?  9.9  HTML5 Form Controls  HTML5 offers a variety of new form controls for web developers that provide increased  usability for web page visitors who are using modern browsers. For example, some new  form controls offer built-in browser edits and validation. Future web designers will prob-  ably take these features for granted someday, but you are right in the middle of this  huge advance in web page coding, so now is a great time to become familiar with these  new elements. The display and support of the new HTML5 form controls will vary by  browser, but you can use them right now! Browsers that do not support the new input  types will display them as text boxes and ignore unsupported attributes or elements. In  this section, you’ll explore the new HTML5 e-mail address, URL, telephone number,  search field, datalist, slider, spinner, calendar, and color form controls.  E-mail Address Input  The e-mail address input form control is similar to the text box. Its purpose is to accept  information that must be in e-mail format, such as “DrMorris2010@gmail.com”. The  input element with type="email" configures an e-mail address input form control. Only   9.9 HTML5 Form Controls  385  browsers that support the HTML5 email attribute value will verify the format of the infor-  mation. Other browsers will treat this form control as a text box. Attributes supported by  the e-mail address input form control are listed in Table 9.2 .  Figure 9.25  see chapter9 email.html in the student files  shows an error message dis-  played by the Opera 11 browser when text other than an e-mail address is entered. Note  that the browser does not verify that the e-mail address actually exists, just that the text  entered is in the correct format. The HTML is   E-mail:      URL Input  The URL input form control is similar to the text box. It is intended to accept any valid type of  URL or URI, such as “ http:  webdevfoundations.net ”. The input element with type="url"  configures a URL input form control. Only browsers that support the HTML5 url attribute  value will verify the format of the information. Other browsers render this form control as a  text box. Attributes supported by the URL input form control are listed in Table 9.2 .  Figure 9.26  see chapter9 url.html in the student files  shows an error message displayed  by Firefox 4 when text other than a URL is entered. Note that the browser does not verify that  the URL actually exists, just that the text entered is in the correct format. The HTML is   Suggest a Website:      Figure 9.25 The Opera 11 browser displays an error  Figure 9.26 The Firefox 4 browser displays an error  message  message  Telephone Number Input   The telephone number input form control is similar to the text box. Its purpose is to accept a  telephone number. The input element with type="tel" configures a telephone number input  form control. An example is in the student files  chapter9 tel.html . Attributes supported by  the telephone number input form control are listed in Table 9.2 . Browsers that do not support  type="tel" will render this form control as a text box. The HTML is   Mobile Number:      386  Chapter 9 Forms  Search Field Input  The search field is similar to the text box and is used to accept a search term. The input  element with type="search" configures a search field input form control. An example  is in the student files  chapter9 search.html . Attributes supported by the search field  control are listed in Table 9.2 . Browsers that do not support type="search" will render  this form control as a text box. The HTML is   Search:      FAQ How can I tell which browsers support the new HTML5 form elements?  There’s no substitute for testing. With that in mind, several resources are listed below that pro-  vide information about browser support for new HTML5 elements:  ● When can I use …: http:  caniuse.com  ● HTML5 and CSS3 Support: http:  findmebyip.com litmus  ● HTML5 and CSS3 Readiness: http:  html5readiness.com  ● The HTML5 Test: http:  html5test.com  ● HTML5 Web Forms and Browser Support: http:  www.standardista.com html5  Datalist Form Control  Figure 9.27 shows the datalist form control in action. Notice how a selection of choices  is offered to the user along with a text box for entry. The datalist is configured using  three elements: an input element, the datalist element, and one or more option ele-  ments. Only browsers that support the HTML5 datalist element will display and process   the datalist items. Other browsers ignore the datalist element and render the form con-  trol as a text box.  Figure 9.27 Firefox 4 displays the datalist form control  The source code for the datalist is available in the student files  chapter9 list.html .   Favorite Color:      9.9 HTML5 Form Controls  387  The HTML is                          Notice that the value of the list attribute on the input element is the same as the  value of the id attribute on the datalist element. This creates the association between  the text box and the datalist form control. One or more option elements can be used  to offer predefined choices to your web page visitor. The option element’s value  attribute configures the text displayed in each list entry. The web page visitor can  choose an option from the list  see Figure 9.27   or type directly in the text box, as  Figure 9.28 The list disappeared when the user began typing in the  shown in Figure 9.28 .  text box  The datalist form control offers a convenient way to offer choices yet provide for flexibil-  ity on a form. At the time this was written, only the Firefox 4 browser supported this new  HTML5 element. See http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter9.html for new developments on this intriguing form control.  FAQ Why should I learn about the new HTML5 form controls if they are not yet  supported by all browsers?  The new form controls offer increased usability for your web page visitors who have modern  browsers. And, they are backward compatible with older browsers, too. Browsers that do not   support the new input types will display them as text boxes and ignore unsupported attributes  or elements. Figure 9.29 depicts the display of a datalist in the Google Chrome browser.  Notice that, unlike Firefox 4, this version of the Chrome browser does not render the list—it  388  Chapter 9 Forms  only renders a text box.  Figure 9.29  Browsers that do  not support the  datalist form  control display a  text box  Slider Form Control  The slider form control provides a visual, interactive user interface that accepts nu-  merical information. The input element with type="range" configures a slider control  in which a number within a specified range is chosen. The default range is from 1 to  100. Only browsers that support the HTML5 range attribute value will display the in-   teractive slider control, shown in Figure 9.30  see chapter9 range.html in the student  files . Note the position of the slider in Figure 9.30 ; this resulted in the value 80 being  chosen. The nondisplay of the value to the user may be a disadvantage of the slider  control.

Use the step attribute to configure a value  for the incremental steps between values to be other than 1.  9.9 HTML5 Form Controls  389  The HTML for the slider control rendered in Figures 9.30 and 9.31 is   Choose a number between 1 and 100:    Low   High  Table 9.11 Additional attributes for slider, spinner, and date time form controls  Attribute  Value  Purpose  max  Maximum numeric  specifies a maximum value  Minimum numeric  specifies a minimum value  value  min  value  step  HTML5 attribute for range, number, and date time input controls;  HTML5 attribute for range, number, and date time input controls;   Incremental numeric  HTML5 attribute for range, number, and date time input controls;  step value  specifies a value for incremental steps  Spinner Form Control  The spinner form control displays an interface that accepts numerical information  and provides feedback to the user. The input element with type="number" configures  a spinner control in which the user can either type a number into the text box or  select a number from a specified range. Only browsers that support the HTML5 number  attribute value will display the interactive spinner control, shown in Figure 9.32   see chapter9 spinner.html in the student files . Other browsers render this form  control as a text box. You should expect increased support in the future.

At the time  this was written, only the Opera browser displayed a calendar interface for date and  time controls. Other browsers currently render the date and time form controls as a text  box, but you should expect increased support in the future.  Color-well Form Control  The color-well form control displays an interface that of-  fers a color-picker interface to the user. The input element  with type="color" configures a control with which the  user can choose a color. Only browsers that support the  HTML5 color attribute value will display a color-picker in-  terface, shown in Figure 9.34  see chapter9 color.html in  the student files . Other browsers render this form control  as a text box.

Hands-On Practice 9.6  In this Hands-On Practice, you will code HTML5 form controls as you confi gure a form  that accepts a name, e-mail address, rating value, and comments from a website visitor.  Figure 9.35 displays the form in the Opera 11 browser, which supports the HTML5 features  used in the Hands-On Practice. Figure 9.36 displays the form in Internet Explorer 9,  which does not support the HTML5 features. Notice that the form is enhanced in  Opera 11, but is still usable in both browsers, demonstrating the concept of progressive  enhancement.  Figure 9.35 The form displayed  in the Opera 11 browser  392  Chapter 9 Forms  Figure 9.36 The form displayed in  the Internet Explorer 9 browser  To get started, launch a text editor and open chapter9 formcss.html in the student files, shown  in Figure 9.22 . Save the file as form5.html. You will modify the file to create a web page similar to  the examples in Figures 9.35 and 9.36 .  1. Modify the title element to display the text “Comment Form”. Confi gure the text contained  within the h1 element to be “Send Us Your Comments”. Add a paragraph to indicate  “Required fi elds are marked with an asterisk *.”  2. Modify the embedded styles:  Change the width of the label element selector to 150 pixels.  a.  b.  Change the left margin of mySubmit to 160 pixels.  3. Modify the form element to submit the form information, using the post method, to the form  processor at http:  webdevbasics.net scripts demo.php :     4. Modify the form controls.   a.  b.  c.  Confi gure the name, e-mail, and comment information to be required. Use an asterisk to  inform your web page visitor about the required fi elds.

Save form5.html and test your web page in a browser. If you use a browser that supports  the HTML5 features used in the form  such as Opera 11 , your page should look similar to  Figure 9.35 . If you use a browser that does not support the form’s HTML5 attributes  such  as Internet Explorer 8 , your form should look similar to Figure 9.36 . The display in other  browsers will depend on the level of HTML5 support. See HTML5 Web Forms and Browser  Support     http:  www.standardista.com html5 html5-web-forms     for  an  HTML5  browser support list.   7. Try submitting the form without entering any information. Figure 9.37 shows the result when  using Opera 11. Note the error message which indicates that the name fi eld is required.  Compare your work with the solution in the student fi les  chapter9 form5.html .  Figure 9.37 The Opera 11 browser  displays an error message  As this Hands-On Practice demonstrated, support of the new HTML5 form control attributes and  values is not uniform. It will be some time before all browsers support these new features.  Design forms with progressive enhancement in mind and be aware of both the benefits and the  limitations of using the new HTML5 features.  HTML5 and Progressive Enhancement  Use HTML5 form elements with the concept of progressive enhancement in mind.  Nonsupporting browsers will display text boxes in place of form elements that are not  recognized. Supporting browsers will display and process the new form controls. This is  progressive enhancement in action: Everyone sees a usable form and visitors who are  using modern browsers benefit from the enhanced features.  This chapter introduced the use of forms on web pages. You learned how to confi gure form controls, provide  for accessibility, and confi gure a form to access server-side processing. You also explored new HTML5 form  elements.

This chapter mentioned a number of sources of free remotely hosted scripts, includ-  ing FormBuddy.com   http:  formbuddy.com  , FormMail   http:  www.formmail.com  ,  Response-o-Matic   http:  response-o-matic.com  , and Master.com   http:  master.com  .  Visit two of these sites or use a search engine to find other resources for free  remotely hosted scripts. Register  if necessary  and examine the website to see  Chapter Summary  399  exactly what is offered. Most sites that provide remotely hosted scripts have a demo  you can view or try. If you have time  or your instructor asks you to , follow the direc-  tions and access a remotely hosted script from one of your web pages. Now that  you’ve at least been through a demo of the product or tried it yourself  even better! ,  it’s time to write your review.  Create a web page that lists the two resource sites you chose and provides a com-  parison of what they offer. List the following for each website:  ● Ease of registration  ● Number of scripts or services offered  ● Types of scripts or services offered  ● Site banner or advertisement  ● Ease of use  ● Your recommendation  Provide links to the resource sites you reviewed and place your name and e-mail  address at the bottom of the page.  2. Search the Web for a web page that uses an HTML form. Print the browser  view of the page. Print out the source code of the web page. Using the printout,  highlight or circle the tags related to forms. On a separate sheet of paper,  create some HTML notes by listing the tags and attributes related to the  forms found on your sample page along with a brief description of their  purpose.  3. Choose one server-side technology mentioned in this chapter: PHP, ASP, JSP,  Ruby on Rails, or ASP.NET. Use the resources listed in the chapter as a starting  point, but also search the Web for additional resources on the server-side  technology you have chosen. Create a web page that lists at least five useful  resources along with information about each that provides the name of the  site, the URL, a brief description of what is offered, and a recommended page   such as a tutorial, free script, and so on . Place your name in an e-mail link on  the web page.   Focus on Web Design  The design of a form, such as the justifi cation of the labels, the use of background colors,  and even the order of the form elements can either increase or decrease the usability of a  form. Visit some of the following resources to explore form design:  ● Web Application Form Design: http:  www.uie.com articles web_forms  ● 10 Tips to a Better Form:  http:  particletree.com features 10-tips-to-a-better-form  ● Sensible Forms: http:  www.alistapart.com articles sensibleforms  ● Best Practices for Form Design:  http:  www.lukew.com resources articles WebForms_LukeW.pdf  Create a web page that lists the URLs of at least two useful resources along with a brief  description of the information you found most interesting or valuable. Design a form on  the web page that applies what you’ve just learned in your exploration of form design.  Place your name in an e-mail link on the web page.  400  Chapter 9 Forms  WEBSITE CASE STUDY  Adding a Form  JavaJam Coffee House  Each of the following case studies continues throughout most of the textbook.

They are created  by a group of people working together as a team. The job roles of project manager, infor-  mation architect, marketing representative, copywriter, editor, graphic designer, data-  base administrator, network administrator, and web developer designer are usually  needed for large projects. In smaller companies or organizations, each person can wear  many hats and juggle his or her job roles. For a smaller-scale project, one of the web de-  velopers may double as the project manager, web designer, graphic designer, database  administrator, and or information architect. It is important to realize that each project is  unique; each has its own needs and requirements. Choosing the right people to work on  a web project team can make it or break it.  Project Job Roles  Project Manager  The project manager oversees the website development process and coordinates team  activities. The project manager creates the project plan and schedule. This individual is  accountable for reaching project milestones and producing results. Excellent organiza-  tional, managerial, and communication skills are required.  Information Architect  The information architect clarifies the mission and goals of the site; assists in determining  the functionality of the site; and is instrumental in defining the site organization, navigation,  and labeling. Web developers and or the project manager sometimes take on this role.  Marketing Representative  The marketing representative handles the organization’s marketing plan and goals. He  or she works with the web designers to create a web presence , or a look and feel, that  aligns with the marketing goals of the organization. The marketing representative also  helps to coordinate the website with other media used for marketing, such as print,  radio, and television marketing.  Copywriter and Editor  The copywriter prepares and evaluates copy. When material from existing brochures,  newsletters, and white papers will be used on the website, it must be repurposed or re-  worked for the web media. The content manager or editor may work with the copywriter  to check the text for correct grammar and consistency.  Content Manager  The content manager participates in the strategic and creative development and en-  hancement of the website. He or she oversees changes in content. The skill set of a suc-  cessful content manager includes editing, copywriting, marketing, technology, and  communications. The person in this dynamic job role must be able to facilitate change.  10.2 The Development Process  413  Graphic Designer  The graphic designer determines the appropriate use of color and graphics on the site,  designs wireframes and page layouts, creates logos and graphic images, and optimizes   images for display on the Web.  Database Administrator  A database administrator is needed if the site accesses information stored in data-  bases. Database administrators create databases, create procedures to maintain data-  bases  including backup and recovery , and control access to databases.  Network Administrator  The network administrator configures and maintains the web server , installs and main-  tains system hardware and software, and controls access security.  Web Developer Web Designer  The job titles of web developer and web designer are often used interchangeably, but  typically a web developer has more of a coding and scripting focus and a web designer  has more of a design and graphics focus. The web designer writes HTML and CSS code  and may fulfill some graphic designer job duties, such as determining the appropriate  use of color, designing wireframes and page layouts, creating logos and graphics, and  optimizing images for display on the Web. The web developer , sometimes referred to as  a front-end web developer , writes HTML, CSS, and client-side scripting such as  JavaScript. Some web developers may specialize in writing server-side scripting with da-  tabase access. Typically, there are multiple web designers and web developers assigned  to a large project, each with his or her area of expertise.  Project Staffing Criteria  Whether the project is large or small, finding the right people to work on it is crucial.  When selecting staff for a project, consider each individual’s work experience, portfolio,  formal education, and industry certifications.  Another option for staffing a web project  or developing an entire website  is to outsource  the project—that is, hire another company to do the work for you. Sometimes portions of  a project are outsourced, such as graphics creation, multimedia animation, or server-side  scripting. When this option is chosen, communication between the project manager and  the external organization is crucial. The outsourcing team needs to be aware of the  project goals and deadlines.  Large or small, developed in-house or outsourced, the success of a website project depends  on planning and communication. Formal project development methodology is used to coor-  dinate and facilitate the planning and communication needed for a successful web project.  10.2  The Development Process  Large corporate and commercial websites don’t just happen. They are carefully built,  usually by following a project development methodology. A methodology is a step-by-step  plan that encompasses the life cycle of a project from start to finish. It comprises a   414  Chapter 10 Web Development  Figure 10.1 The  System  Development Life  Cycle  SDLC   series of phases , each having specific activities and deliverables. Most modern method-  ologies have their roots in the System Development Life Cycle  SDLC  , a process that  has been used for several decades to build large-scale information systems. The SDLC  comprises a set of phases, sometimes called steps or stages. Each phase is usually  completed before beginning the activities in the next phase. The basic phases of the  standard SDLC  see Figure 10.1   are systems investigation, systems analysis, systems  design, systems implementation, and maintenance.  Websites are often developed using a variation of the SDLC that is modified to apply to  web projects. Large companies and web design firms usually create their own special  methodology for use on projects. The Website Development Cycle is a guide to successful  web project management. Depending on the scope and complexity of a particular project,  some steps can be completed in a single meeting; other steps can take weeks or months.  The Website Development Cycle, shown in Figure 10.2 , usually consists of the following   steps: Conceptualization, Analysis, Design, Production, Testing, Launch, Maintenance,  and Evaluation.  Figure 10.2 The  Website  Development  Cycle  10.2 The Development Process  415  FAQ What about other development methodologies?  The development methodology presented in this chapter is a version of the traditional SDLC  modified for website development. Other development methods include the following:  ● Prototyping. A small working model is created and shown to the client. It is continually  revised by the developer until it is usable for the intended purpose. This method can easily  be included in the Website Development Cycle during the Design phase.  ● Spiral System Development. This is excellent for very-large-scale or phased projects  where it is important to reduce risk. Small portions of the project are completed one after  another in a spiral system of development.  ● Joint Application Development  JAD . This type of development focuses on group  meetings and collaboration between the users and developers of a website or system. It is  generally used only with in-house development.  ● Agile Software Development. This development methodology is viewed as innovative  in that it stresses responsiveness based on generating and sharing knowledge within a  development team and with the client. The philosophy emphasizes code over documenta-  tion and results in the project being developed in many small, iterative steps.  ● Organization-Specific Development Methodologies. Large companies and web  development firms often create their own version or interpretation of a site development  methodology to be used for projects.  An important aspect of website development is that you are never finished—your site  needs to be kept fresh and up-to-date, there will be errors or omissions that need to be  corrected, and new components and pages will be needed. The first step is to decide  why the website is needed in the first place.  Conceptualization  What opportunity or issue is the site addressing? What is the motivation for the site?  Perhaps your client owns a retail store and wishes to sell products over the Internet.  Perhaps your client’s competitor just launched a website and your client needs to create  one just to keep up. Perhaps you have a great idea that will be the next eBay!  Because the focus of your work is to make the site usable and appealing to your target  audience, you must determine the site’s intended audience. It is crucial to be aware of  who your audience is and what their preferences are.  Another task during conceptualization is to determine the site’s long-term and short-  term goals or mission. Perhaps a short-term goal is simply to publish a home page.   Perhaps a long-term goal is for 20% of a company’s product sales to be made on the  website or you may simply want a certain number of website visitors each month.  Whatever they are, it is better if the objectives are measurable. Decide how you will  measure the success  or failure  of your website.  Determining the purpose and goals of a site is usually done with the cooperation of the  client, project manager, and information architect. In a formal project environment, a  document that details the results of this step is created and then approved by the client  before development can proceed.  416  Analysis  Chapter 10 Web Development  The Analysis phase involves meetings and interviews with key client personnel. Analysis  is usually completed by the project manager, information architect or other analyst, and  the client’s marketing representative and related personnel. The network administrator  and database administrator may be interviewed depending on the scope of the project.  Common tasks completed during the Analysis phase are as follows:  ● Determine Information Topics. Organize the information to be presented on the  site into categories and create a hierarchy. These information topics will be used  later as a starting point for developing the site navigation.  ● Determine Functionality Requirements. State what the site will do, not how it  will do it. For example, state that “the site will accept credit card orders from cus-  tomers,” not “the site will perform order processing using PHP to look up each  price and sales tax information in MySQL databases and use real-time credit card  verification supplied by somewebsite.com.” Note the difference in the level of  detail in these functionality requirements .  ● Determine Environmental Requirements. What environmental requirements ,  such as hardware, operating system, memory capacity, screen resolution, and  bandwidth, will your site visitors use? What type of hardware and software  requirements will the web server need?  ● Determine Content Requirements. Does content already exist in another format   for example, brochures, catalogs, white papers ? Determine who is responsible  for creating and repurposing the content for the site. Does the client company  or marketing department have any content requirements that must be met? For  example, is there a specific visual aesthetic or corporate branding component  that must be present on the site?  ● Compare the Old Approach to the New Approach. Perhaps you are not creating  a new website, but modifying an existing one. What benefits or added value will  the new version provide?  ● Review Your Competitors’ Sites. A careful review of your competitors’ web presence  will help you design a site that will stand out from the crowd and be more appealing  to your shared customer base. Note the good and bad components of these sites.  ● Estimate Costs. Create an estimate of the costs and time involved to create the site.  A formal project plan is often created or modified at this point. Often, an application  such as Microsoft Project is used to estimate costs and plan project schedules.  ● Do a Cost Benefit Analysis. Create a document that compares the costs and   benefits of the site. Measurable benefits are the most useful and most appealing  to clients. In a formal project environment, a document that details the results  of this cost benefit analysis must be approved by the client before the team  can proceed.  Design  Once everyone knows what is needed, it is time to determine how it can be accom-  plished. The Design phase involves meetings and interviews with key client personnel.  Design tasks are usually completed by the project manager, information architect or  10.2 The Development Process  417  other analyst, graphic designer s , senior web developer s , and the client’s marketing  representative and related personnel. Common tasks during the Design phase include  the following:  ● Choose a Site Organization. As discussed in Chapter 5 , common website organi-  zational forms are hierarchical, linear, and random. Determine which is best for  the project site and create a site map.  ● Design the Prototype. As a starting point, sketch out the design on paper.  Sometimes it’s useful to sketch within an empty browser frame  see chapter10   sketch.doc in the student files . Often, a graphics application is used to create  sample web page mock-ups, or wireframes. These can be shown to clients as a  prototype, or working model, of the system for approval. They can also be shown  to focus groups for usability testing .  ● Design a Page Layout. Determine the visual aesthetic and layout with wireframes  and sample page mock-ups. Items such as the site color scheme, the size of logo  graphics, button graphics, and text should be determined. Using the page lay-  out design and site map, create sample layouts for the home page and content  pages. Use a graphic application to create mock-ups of these pages to get a good  idea of how the site will function. If you use a web authoring tool at this early  stage, you run the risk of your manager or client thinking that you already have   the site half done and insisting on early delivery.  ● Document Each Page. While this may seem unnecessary, lack of content is a  frequent cause of website project delays. Prepare a content sheet for each page,  such as the one shown in Figure 10.3  see chapter10 contentsheet.doc in the stu-  dent files , which describes the functionality of the document, text and graphic  content requirements, source of content, and approver of content.  The site map and page design prototypes are usually approved by the client before the  Figure 10.3  Sample content  sheet  team can progress to the Production phase.  418  Production  Chapter 10 Web Development  During production , all the previous work comes together  hopefully  in a usable and ef-  fective website. During the Production phase, the web designers and web developers  are on the critical path—their work must be completed as scheduled or the project will  be late. The other project members are consulted, as needed, for clarification and ap-  proval. Common tasks of the Production phase include the following:  ● Choose a Web Authoring Tool. The use of a web authoring tool, such as Adobe  Dreamweaver or Microsoft Expression Web, can greatly increase productivity.  Specific productivity aids include designer notes, page templates, task man-  agement, and web page check-in and check-out to avoid overlapping page  updates. The use of an authoring tool will serve to standardize the HTML used in  the project pages. Any standards related to indentation, comments, and so on  should be determined at this time.  ● Organize Your Site Files. Consider placing images and media in their own folder.  Also, place server-side scripts in a separate folder. Determine naming conven-  tions for web pages, images, and media.  ● Develop and Individually Test Components. During this task, the graphic design-  ers and web developers create and individually test their contributions to the  site. As the images, web pages, and server-side scripting are developed, they  are individually tested. This is called unit testing . On some projects, a senior  web developer or the project manager will review the components for quality and  Once all components have been created and unit tested, it’s time to put them together  standards compliance.  and begin the Testing phase.  Testing  The components should be published to a test web server. This test web server should  have the same operating system and web server software that the production  actual   web server will be using. Some common site testing considerations follow:  ● Test on Different Browsers and Browser Versions. It is very important to test  your pages on commonly used browsers and versions of those browsers.  ● Test with Different Screen Resolutions. Although, as a web developer, you may  use a very high screen resolution, not everyone uses 1920×1200 screen resolu-   tion. The most commonly used screen resolutions at the time of this writing are  1024×768, 1280×800, and 1366×768. Be sure to test your web pages on various  resolutions—you might be surprised at the results.  ● Test Using Different Bandwidths. If you live and work in a metropolitan area,  everyone you know may have broadband access to the Internet. However, many  people still use dial-up connections to access the Web. It is important to test  your site on both slow and fast connections. Images that look great over your  school’s T3 line may load very slowly over a 56K modem.  ● Test from Another Location. Be sure to test your website using a computer other  than the one the website was developed on, in order to simulate the web page  visitor’s experience more closely.  10.2 The Development Process  419  ● Test Using Mobile Devices. Mobile use of the Web is increasing all the time—test  your site on one or more of the currently popular smartphones. See Chapter 7 for  mobile web testing tools.  ● Test, Test, Test. There is no such thing as too much testing. Humans make mis-  takes. It is much better for you and your team to find the errors than for your cli-  ent to point them out to you when they review the website.  Does this sound like a lot to keep track of? It is. That’s why it’s a good idea to create a  test plan , which is a document that describes what will be tested on each page of a website.  A sample test plan for a web page, shown in Figure 10.4  see chapter10 testplan.pdf in  the student files , can help you organize your testing as you check your document in  different browsers and screen resolutions. The document validation section covers  content, links, and any forms or scripting that are required for the page. Search engine  optimization meta tags are discussed in Chapter 13 . However, at this point, you should  be able to verify that the page title is descriptive and includes the company or organiza-  tion’s name. Testing your page using different bandwidths is important because web  pages that take too long to download are often abandoned.   Figure 10.4  Sample test plan  Automated Testing Tools and Validators  The web authoring tool you use for your project will provide some built-in site reporting and  testing features. Web authoring applications such as Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft  Expression Web provide functions such as spell-check, link checks, and load time calcula-  tions. Each application has unique features. Dreamweaver’s reporting includes link check-  ing, accessibility, and code validation. There are other automated testing tools and  validators available. The W3C Markup Validation Service   http:  validator.w3.org   can be  used to validate both HTML and XHTML. Test CSS for proper syntax using the W3C CSS  Validation Service   http:  jigsaw.w3.org css-validator  . Analyze the download speed of your  page using the Web Page Analyzer   http:  www.websiteoptimization.com services analyze  .  420  Chapter 10 Web Development  Adobe also offers cross-browser testing at BrowserLab   http:  browserlab.adobe.com  .  Testing tools that offer additional features such as spell-check, browser compatibil-  ity, page load time, and broken link checking are available from NetMechanic    http:  www.netmechanic.com   and others.  Accessibility Testing  Accessible web pages can be used by all individuals, including those with visual, hearing,  mobility, and cognitive challenges. As you’ve worked through this book, accessibility has  been an integral part of your web page design and coding rather than an afterthought.  Focus on  Accessibility  You’ve configured headings and subheadings, navigation within unordered lists, images  with alternate text, and associations between text and form controls. These techniques all  increase the accessibility of a web page.  Web Accessibility Standards  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Section 508    http:  www.access-board.gov sec508 guide 1194.22.htm   requires electronic and information technology, including web pages, that are used by U.S. federal  agencies to be accessible to people with disabilities. At the time this was  written, the Section 508 standards were undergoing revision.  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  WCAG 2.0 .  WCAG 2.0     http:  www.w3.org TR WCAG20     considers  an  accessible  web  page  to  be  perceivable, operable, and understandable for people with a wide range of abilities. The  page should be robust enough to work with a variety of browsers and other user  agents, such as assistive technologies  for example, screen readers  and mobile  devices. The guiding principles of WCAG 2.0 are known as POUR:  1. Content must be P erceivable.  2. Interface components in the content must be O perable.   3. Content and controls must be U nderstandable.  4. Content should be R obust enough to work with current and future user agents,  including assistive technologies.  Prove your compliance with accessibility standards by performing accessibility  testing on your site. There are a variety of accessibility checkers available.  Adobe Dreamweaver includes a built-in accessibility checker. WebAIM Wave     http:  wave.webaim.org    and  ATRC  AChecker     http:  www.achecker.ca checker     are  two popular free online accessibility evaluation tools. Several browser toolbars  are available that can be used to assess accessibility, including the Web Developer  Extension   http:  chrispederick.com work web-developer  , WAT-C Web  Accessibility  Toolbar     http:  www.wat-c.org tools   ,  and  the  AIS  Web  Accessibility  Toolbar    http:  www.visionaustralia.org.au ais toolbar  .  It’s important not to rely completely on automated tests—you’ll want to review the  pages yourself. For example, while an automated test can check for the presence of an  alt attribute, it takes a human to critically think and decide whether the text of the alt at-  tribute is an appropriate description for a person who cannot view the image. WebAIM  provides a detailed checklist   http:  www.webaim.org standards wcag checklist   that prompts you with items to review in order to verify compliance with WCAG 2.0  requirements.  10.2 The Development Process  421  Usability Testing  Usability is the measure of the quality of a user’s experience when interacting with a website.  It’s about making a website that is easy, efficient, and pleasant for your visitors. Usability.gov    http:  usability.gov   describes five factors that affect the user’s experience:  ● Ease of Learning. How easy is it to learn to use the website? Is the navigation  intuitive? Does a new visitor consider it easy to learn to perform basic tasks on  the website or is he or she frustrated?  ● Efficiency of Use. How do experienced users perceive the website? Once they are  comfortable, are they able to complete tasks efficiently and quickly or are they  frustrated?  ● Memorability. When a visitor returns to a website, does he or she remember  enough to use it productively or is the visitor back at the beginning of the learn-  ing curve  and frustrated ?  ● Error Frequency and Severity. Do website visitors make errors when navigating  or filling in forms on the website? Are they serious errors? Is it easy to recover  from errors or are visitors frustrated?  ● Subjective Satisfaction. Do users like using the website? Are they satisfied? Why  or why not?  Testing how actual web page visitors use a website is called usability testing . It can be  conducted at any phase of a website’s development and is often performed more than  once. A usability test is conducted by asking users to complete tasks on a website, such  as placing an order, looking up the phone number of a company, or finding a product.  The exact tasks will vary depending on the website being tested. The users are moni-  tored while they try to perform these tasks. They are asked to think out loud about their  doubts and hesitations. The results are recorded  often on video tape  and discussed   with the web design team. Often, changes are made to the navigation and page layouts  based on these tests. Perform the small-scale usability test in Hands-On Exercise 5 at  the end of this chapter to become more familiar with this technique.  If usability testing is done early in the development phase of a website, it may use the paper  page layouts and site map. If the development team is struggling with a design issue, some-  times a usability test can help to determine which design idea is the better choice. When us-  ability is done during a later phase, such as the Testing phase, the actual website is tested.  This can lead to confirmation that the site is easy to use and well designed, to last minute  changes in the website, or to a plan for website enhancements in the near future.  Launch  Your client—whether another company or another department in your organization—  needs to review and approve the test website before the files are published to the live  site. Sometimes this approval takes place at a face-to-face meeting. Other times, the  test URL is given to the client and the client e-mails approval or requested changes.  Once the test website has been approved, it is published to your live production website   this is called a launch  . If you think you are finished, think again! It is crucial to test all  site components after publishing to make sure the site functions properly in its new en-  vironment. Marketing and promotional activities for the website  see Chapter 13   usually  take place at this time.  422  Chapter 10 Web Development  Maintenance  A website is never finished. There are always errors or omissions that were overlooked  during the development process. Clients usually find many new uses for a website once  they have one and request modifications, additions, and new sections  this is called  site maintenance  . At this point, the project team identifies the new opportunity or en-  hancement and begins another loop through the development process.  Other types of updates needed may be relatively small—perhaps a link is broken, a word is  misspelled, or a graphic needs to be changed. These small changes are usually made as  soon as they are noticed. The question of who makes the changes and who approves them  is often a matter of company policy. If you are a freelance web developer, the situation is  more straightforward—you will make the changes and your client will approve them.  Evaluation  Remember the goals set for the website in the Conceptualization phase? During the  evaluation phase, it’s time to review them and determine whether your website meets  them. If not, consider how you can enhance the site and begin another loop through the  development process.  Checkpoint 10.1  1. Describe the role of the project manager.  2. Explain why many different roles are needed on a large-scale web project.  3. List three different techniques used to test a website. Describe each technique in one or two   Domain Name Overview  sentences.  10.3  VideoNote  Choosing a  Domain Name  A crucial part of establishing an effective web presence is choosing a domain name ; it  serves to locate your website on the Internet. If your business or organization is new,  then it’s often convenient to select a domain name while you are deciding on a company  name. If your organization is well established, choose a domain name that relates to  your existing business presence. Although many domain names have already been pur-  chased, there are still a lot of available options.  Choosing a Domain Name  ● Describe Your Business. Although there is a long-standing trend to use “fun”  words as domain names  for example, yahoo.com, google.com, bing.com,  woofoo.com, and so on , think carefully before doing so. Domain names for  traditional businesses and organizations are the foundation of the organization’s  web presence and should include the business name or purpose.  ● Be Brief, If Possible. While most people find new websites with search engines,  some of your website visitors will type your domain name in a browser. A shorter  domain name is preferable to a longer one—it’s easier for your visitors to remember.  10.3 Domain Name Overview  423  ● Avoid Hyphens  - . Using the hyphen character  commonly called a dash  in a  domain name makes it difficult to pronounce the name. Also, someone typing  your domain name may forget the dash and end up at a competitor’s site! If you  can, avoid the use of dashes in a domain name.  ● There’s More Than .com. While the .com top-level domain name  TLD  is still  the most popular for commercial and personal websites, consider also register-  ing your domain name with other TLDs, such as .biz, .net, .us, .mobi, and so  on. Commercial businesses should avoid the .org TLD, which is the first choice  for nonprofit organizations. You don’t have to create a website for each domain  name that you register. You can arrange with your domain name registrar  for  example, Register.com [ http:  www.register.com ]  for the extra domain names to  point visitors to the domain name where your website is located. This is called  domain name redirection .  ● Brainstorm Potential Keywords. Think about words that a potential visitor might  type into a search engine when looking for your type of business or organization.  This is the starting point for your list of keywords . If possible, work one or more  keywords into your domain name  but still keep it as short as possible .  ● Avoid Trademarked Words or Phrases. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office   USPTO  defines a trademark as a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combi-  nation of words, phrases, symbols, or designs, that identifies and distinguishes  the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A starting point in   researching trademarks is the USPTO Trademark Electronic Search System   TESS ; visit http:  tess2.uspto.gov . See http:  www.uspto.gov for more informa-  tion about trademarks.  ● Know the Territory. Explore the way your potential domain name and keywords  are already used on the Web. It’s a good idea to type your potential domain  names  and related words  into a search engine to see what may already exist.  ● Verify Availability. Check with one of the many domain name registrars to deter-  mine whether your domain name choices are available. A few of the many sites  that offer domain name registration services are listed below:  ● Register.com: http:  www.register.com  ● Network Solutions: http:  www.networksolutions.com  ● GoDaddy.com: http:  www.godaddy.com  Each of these sites offers a search feature that provides you with a way to deter-  mine whether a potential domain name is available, and if it is owned, who owns  it. Often the domain name is already taken. If that’s the case, the sites listed  previously will provide you with alternate suggestions that may be appropriate.  Don’t give up; a domain name is out there waiting for your business.  Registering a Domain Name  Once you’ve found your perfect domain name, don’t waste any time in registering it. The  cost to register a domain name varies, but it is quite reasonable. The top rate for a .com  1-year registration is currently $35  and there are numerous opportunities for discounts  with multiyear packages or bundled web hosting services . It’s perfectly okay to register  a domain name even if you are not ready to publish your website immediately. There are  424  Chapter 10 Web Development  many companies that provide domain name registration services, as listed previously.  When you register a domain name, your contact information  your name, phone number,  mailing address, and e-mail address  will be entered into the WHOIS database and is  available to anyone unless you choose the option for private registration. While there is  usually a small annual fee for private registration , it shields your personal information  from unwanted spam and curiosity seekers.  Obtaining a domain name is just one part of establishing a web presence. You also  need to host your website somewhere. The next section introduces you to the factors in-  volved in choosing a web host.  10.4  Web Hosting  Where is the appropriate place for your web project to “live”? Choosing the most appro-  priate web hosting provider for your business or client could be one of the most impor-  tant decisions you make. A good web hosting service will provide a robust, reliable  home for your website. A poor web hosting service will be a source of problems and  complaints. Which would you prefer?  Web Hosting Providers  A web hosting provider is an organization that offers storage for your website files along  with the service of making them available on the Internet. Your domain name, such as  webdevfoundations.net, is associated with an IP address that points to your website on   the web server at the web hosting provider. It is common for web hosting providers to  charge a setup fee in addition to the monthly hosting fee.  Hosting fees vary widely. The cheapest hosting company is not necessarily the one to  use. Never consider using a free web hosting provider for a business website. These free  sites are great for kids, college students, and hobbyists, but they are unprofessional.  The last thing you or your client wants is to be perceived as unprofessional or not seri-  ous about the business at hand. As you consider different web hosting providers, try  contacting their support phone numbers and e-mail addresses to determine just how  responsive they really are. Word of mouth, web searches, and online directories such as  Hosting Review   http:  www.hosting-review.com   are all resources in your quest for the  perfect web hosting provider.  Types of Web Hosting  ● Virtual Hosting , or shared hosting, is a popular choice for small websites    Figure 10.5  . The web hosting provider’s physical web server is divided into a  number of virtual domains and multiple websites are set up on the same computer.  You have the authority to update files in your own website space, while the web  hosting provider maintains the web server computer and Internet connectivity.  ● Dedicated Hosting is the rental and exclusive use of a computer and connec-  tion to the Internet that is housed on the web hosting company’s premises. A  dedicated server is usually needed for a website that could have a considerable  amount of traffic, such as tens of millions of hits a day. The server can usually be  configured and operated remotely from the client’s company, or you can pay the  web hosting provider to administer it for you.  10.5 Choosing a Virtual Host  425  Figure 10.5 Virtual  web hosting  this computer.  10.5  Choosing a Virtual Host  ● Co-Located Hosting uses a computer that your organization has purchased  and configured. Your web server is housed and connected to the Internet at  the web host’s physical location, but your organization typically administers   A number of factors to consider when choosing a web host have been discussed, includ-  ing bandwidth, disk storage space, technical support, and the availability of e-com-  merce packages. For a handy list of these factors and others to consider in your quest  for a virtual web host, review the web host checklist shown in Table 10.1 .  FAQ Why do I care about knowing which operating system my web hosting  provider uses?  Knowing the operating system used by your web hosting provider is important because it  can help you with troubleshooting your website. Often, students’ websites work great on  their own PC  usually with a Windows-based operating system  but fall apart  with broken  links and images that do not load  after being published on a free web server that uses a  different operating system.  Some operating systems, such as Windows, treat uppercase and lowercase letters in  exactly the same way. Other operating systems, such as UNIX and Linux, consider upper-  case and lowercase letters to be different. This is called being case-sensitive . For  example, when a web server running on a Windows operating system receives a request  generated by an anchor tag coded as  My Page  , it will  return a file named with any combination of uppercase or lowercase letters. The values  MyPage.html, mypage.html, and myPage.html can all be used. However, when the re-  quest generated by the same anchor tag is received by a web server running on a UNIX  system  which is case-sensitive , the file would only be found if it were really saved as  MyPage.html. If the file were named mypage.html, a 404 Not Found error would result.  This is a good reason to be consistent when naming files; consider always using lowercase  letters for file names.  426  Chapter 10 Web Development  Table 10.1 Web host checklist  Operating ❒ UNIX  System ❒ Linux  for both.

While unlimited bandwidth is great, it is not always available. A typical  low-traffic website may transfer between 100 and 500MB per month. A medium-  traffic site should be okay with about 20GB of data transfer bandwidth per month.  Technical ❒ E-mail  Support ❒ Chat  Review the description of technical support on the web host’s site.

Hands-On Exercises  1.  Skip this exercise if you have completed Hands-On Practice 2.14 in Chapter 2 . In  this exercise, you will validate a web page. Choose one of the web pages that you  have created. Launch a browser and visit the W3C Markup Validation Service    http:  validator.w3.org  . Click on the Validate by File Upload tab. Click the Browse  button, select a file from your computer, and click the Check button to upload the  file to the W3C site. Your page will be analyzed and a Results page will be generated  that shows a report of violations of the doctype that is used by your web page. The  error messages display the offending code along with the line number, column  number, and a description of the error. Don’t worry if your web page does not pass the  validation the first time. Many well-known websites have pages that do not validate—  even Yahoo!   http:  www.yahoo.com   had validation errors at the time this was  written. Modify your web page document and revalidate it until you see a message  that states “This document was successfully checked as HTML5!”  see Figure 10.6  .  You can also validate pages directly from the Web. Try validating the W3C’s home  page   http:  www.w3.org  , Yahoo!   http:  www.yahoo.com  , and your school’s  home page. Visit the W3C Markup Validation Service   http:  validator.w3.org   and  notice the Validate by URI area. Enter the URL of the web page you would like to  validate in the Address text box. Click the Check button and view the results.  Experiment with the character encoding and doctype options. The W3C’s page   430  Chapter 10 Web Development  Figure 10.6  Message  indicating that the  web page has  passed the  validation  should pass the validation. Don’t worry if the other pages do not validate.  Validation is not required for web pages. However, web pages that pass the valida-  tion should display well in most browsers.   Note: If you have published pages to the  web, try validating one of them instead of your school’s home page.   2. Run an automated accessibility test on the home page of your school’s website.  Use both the WebAIM Wave   http:  wave.webaim.org   and ATRC AChecker    http:  www.achecker.ca checker   automated tests. Describe the differences in the  way these tools report the results of the test. Did both tests find similar errors? Write  a one-page report that describes the results of the tests. Include your recommenda-  tions for improving the website.  3. The Web Page Analyzer   http:  www.websiteoptimization.com services analyze    calculates download times for a web page and associated assets, along with  providing suggestions for improvement. Visit this site and test your school’s home  page  or a page assigned by your instructor . After the test is run, a web page speed  report will display file sizes and include suggestions for improvement. Print out the  browser view of this results page and write a one-page report that describes the  results of the test and your own recommendations for improvement.  4. The Dr. Watson site   http:  watson.addy.com   offers free web page validation. Visit this  site and test your school’s home page  or a page assigned by your instructor . After the  test is run, a report is displayed with categories such as server response, estimated  download speed, syntax and style analysis, spell-check, link verification, images,  search engine compatibility  see Chapter 13  , site link popularity  see Chapter 13  , and  source code. Print out the browser view of this results page and write a one-page report   that describes the results of the test and your own recommendations for improvement.  5.

Another good resource is Steven Krug’s book, Don’t Make Me Think.  6. See the description of usability testing in Hands-On Exercise 5. In a small group,  perform usability tests on two similar websites, such as the following:  ● Barnes and Noble   http:  www.bn.com   and Powell’s Books   http:  powells.com    ● AccuWeather.com   http:  accuweather.com   and Weather Underground    http:  www.wunderground.com    ● Running.com   http:  running.com   and Cool Running   http:  www.coolrunning.com    Select and list three scenarios to test. Decide who will be the users, the tester, and  the observer. Follow the steps listed in Hands-On Exercise 5.  7. Pretend that you are on a job interview. Choose a role on a web project team that  interests you. In three or four sentences, describe why you would be an excellent  addition to a web development team in that role.  Web Research  1.  This chapter discussed options for hosting websites. In this research exercise, you will   search for web hosting providers and report on three that meet the following criteria:  ● Support PHP and MySQL.  ● Offer e-commerce capabilities.  ● Provide at least 100MB disk space.  Use your favorite search engine to find web hosting providers or visit web host di-  rectories such as Hosting Review   http:  www.hosting-review.com   and HostIndex.  com   http:  www.hostindex.com  . The web server survey results provided by  432  Chapter 10 Web Development  Netcraft   http:  uptime.netcraft.com perf reports Hosters   may also be useful.  Create a web page that presents your findings. Include links to your three web host-  ing providers. Your web page should include a table of information such as the  setup fees, monthly fees, domain name registration costs, amount of disk space,  type of e-commerce package, and cost of e-commerce package. Use color and  graphics appropriately on your web page. Place your name and e-mail address at  the bottom of your web page.  2. This chapter discussed the different job functions that are needed to develop large  websites. Choose a job role that interests you. Search for information about avail-  able jobs in your geographical area. Search for technology jobs with your favorite  search engine or visit a job site such as Monster.com   http:  www.monster.com  ,  Dice   http:  www.dice.com  , Indeed   http:  www.indeed.com  , or CareerBuilder.  com     http:  www.careerbuilder.com   and search for your desired location and job type. Find three possible job positions that interest you and report on them.  Create a web page that includes a brief description of the job role you have chosen,  a description of the three available positions, a description of the types of experience  and or educational background required for the positions, and the salary range   if available . Use color and graphics appropriately on your web page. Place your  name and e-mail address at the bottom of your web page.  Focus on Web Design  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services off ers a free online  PDF book, Research-Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines    http:  www.usability.gov guidelines guidelines_book.pdf  . The book suggests guidelines for a variety of topics, including navigation, text appearance, scrolling and  paging, writing content, usability testing, and accessibility.

Other  types of media, such as audio and video, are introduced in this chapter.  Appropriate movies and sounds on your web pages can make them more inter-  esting and informative. Sources of these media types, the HTML code needed  to place media on a web page, and suggested uses of media are introduced.  435  436  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  You began to work with interactivity in Chapter 6 when you used CSS pseudo-classes to  respond to mouse movements over hyperlinks. You’ll expand your CSS skill set as you  configure an interactive image gallery and explore CSS3 transition and transform proper-  ties. Adding the right touch of interactivity to a web page can make it engaging and  compelling for your visitors.  Technologies commonly used to add interactivity to web pages include Flash, Java applets,  JavaScript, and Ajax. This chapter introduces you to these techniques. Each of these topics  is explored more fully in other books; each technology could be the sole subject of an entire  book or college course. As you read this chapter and try the examples, concentrate on learn-  ing the features and capabilities of each technology, rather than trying to master the details.  11.1  Plug-Ins, Containers, and Codecs  Web browsers are designed to display web pages and GIF, JPG, and PNG images, among  others. When the media is not one of these types, the browser searches for a plug-in or  helper application that is configured to display the file type. If it cannot find a plug-in or  helper application  which runs in a separate window from the browser  on the visitor’s  computer, the web browser offers the visitor the option of saving the file to their  computer. Several commonly used plug-ins are listed as follows:  ● Adobe Flash Player   http:  www.adobe.com products flashplayer  . The Flash Player displays SWF files. These can contain audio, video, and animation, along  with interactivity.  ● Adobe Shockwave Player   http:  www.adobe.com products shockwaveplayer  .  The Shockwave Player displays high-performance multimedia created using the  Adobe Director application.  ● Adobe Reader   http:  www.adobe.com products acrobat readstep2.html  .  Adobe Reader is commonly used to display information stored in PDF format,  such as printable brochures, documents, and white papers.  ● Java Runtime Environment   http:  www.java.com en download manual.jsp  .  The Java Runtime Environment  JRE  is used to run applications and applets   utilizing Java technology.  ● RealPlayer    http:  www.real.com   . The RealPlayer plug-in plays streaming audio, video, animation, and multimedia presentations on the Web.  ● Windows Media Player   http:  www.microsoft.com windows windowsmedia   download   . The Windows Media Player plug-in plays streaming audio, video, animation, and multimedia presentations on the Web.  ● Apple  QuickTime   http:  www.apple.com quicktime download  . The Apple QuickTime plug-in displays QuickTime animation, music, audio, and video  directly within the web page.  The plug-ins and helper applications listed previously have been used on the Web for  many years. What is new about HTML5 audio and video is that it is native to the  browser; no plug-ins are needed. When working with native HTML5 audio and video, you  need to be aware of the container  which is designated by the file extension  and the  codec  which is the algorithm used to compress the media .  11.1 Plug-Ins, Containers, and Codecs  437  Explore Table 11.1 and Table 11.2 , which list common media file extensions, the con-  tainer file type, and a description with codec information  if applicable for HTML5 .

We’ll get started  with the easiest method, which is coding a hyperlink.  Provide a Hyperlink  The easiest way to give your website visitors access to an audio or a video file is to  create a simple hyperlink to the file. For example, the code to hyperlink to a sound file  named WDFpodcast.mp3 is   Podcast Episode 1   MP3   When your website visitor clicks on the hyperlink, the plug-in for MP3 files that is  installed on the computer  such as QuickTime  typically will display embedded in a  new browser window or tab. Your web page visitor can then use the plug-in to play  the sound. If your website visitor right-clicks on the hyperlink, the media file can  be downloaded and saved.  Hands-On Practice 11.1  In this Hands-On Practice, you will create a web page similar to Figure 11.1 that contains an h1  tag  and  a  hyperlink  to  an  MP3  fi  le.  The  web  page  will  also  provide  a  hyperlink  to  a  text transcript  of that fi le to provide for accessibility. It’s useful to your web page visitors to also indicate the type  of fi le  such as an MP3  and, optionally, the size of the fi le to be accessed.  Figure 11.1 The default  MP3 player will launch in  the browser when the visitor  clicks on Podcast Episode 1   Copy the podcast.mp3 and podcast.txt files from the chapter11 starters folder in the student  files  and  save  them  to  a  folder  named  podcast.  Use  the  chapter2 template.html  file  as  a starting  point and create a web page with the heading “Web Design Podcast”, a hyperlink to the MP3  file, and a hyperlink to the text transcript. Save your web page as podcast2.html and display it in  a browser. Test your web page in different browsers, using different versions. When you click on  the MP3 hyperlink, an audio player  whichever player or plug-in is configured for the browser  will  launch  to  play  the  file.  When  you  click  on  the  hyperlink  for  the  text  transcript,  the  text  will display  in the browser. Compare your work to chapter11 podcast podcast.html in the student files.  11.3 XHTML Object and Param Elements  439  11.3  XHTML Object and Param Elements  Object Element  Another way to include multimedia on your web page is to embed the audio or video file  in the page and optionally display a control panel or player for the multimedia. When  coding in XHTML syntax  refer to Chapter 2  , the object element is used for this purpose.  The code in this section uses XHTML syntax, but the object and param elements may  also be used in HTML5. The object element is a multipurpose container tag for adding  various types of objects to a web page. The object element begins with the    tag and ends with the   tag. Additional configuration values, called parame-  ters, will usually need to be coded using the param element. Table 11.3 lists the com-  mon attributes of the object element.  Table 11.3 Common attributes of media object elements  Attribute  Value  Usage  data  File name  classid  Required; provides the media’s file name  Uniquely identifies the  Optional; used with Windows; the classid identifies an  player software  QuickTime:  Windows Player:  ActiveX control that must be installed on the visitor’s PC  classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"  classid="6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6"  Flash Shockwave Player:  classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"  codebase  Specifies a relative path for   Optional; facilitates the location and download of the plug-in if  the location of the plug-in  needed; not used with Windows Media Player 7  QuickTime:  codebase="http:  www.apple.com qtactivex qtplugin.cab"  Flash Shockwave Player:  codebase=  "http:  download.macromedia.com pub shockwave cabs flash   swflash.cabVersion=8,0,22,0  "  height  title  Numeric, number of pixels  Optional; configures the height of the media control console  Brief text description  Optional; may be displayed by browsers or assistive  Optional; specifies the MIME type of the media file, such as  technologies  type  Valid MIME type  audio mpeg or video quicktime  width  Numeric, number of pixels  Optional; configures the width of the media control console  Param Element  The param element is a self-contained tag with two attributes: name and value. Use    for XHTML syntax and   for HTML5 syntax. All the   tags for  the object appear before the ending   tag. The player’s documentation will in-  dicate whether parameters are needed and the format you should use. Table 11.4 lists  common param element attribute values.  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Table 11.4 Common param element media attribute values  440  Attribute  Value  Usage  src  Valid file name, name of   Required; provides the name of the file to be played  Optional; determines whether the media will play  automatically when the page is loaded  if omitted,  the media may not automatically play   Optional; indicates whether the media console will  media file  autoplay  true or false  controller  true or false  not  uniformly supported   display  hidden  true  not uniformly  supported   loop  Numeric value or true  for continuous play  not  will repeat  uniformly supported   Audio on a Web Page  on a web page is  Optional; hides the default media console  Optional; determines how many times the media file  <object data="soundloop.mp3" height="50" width="100"  type="audio mpeg" title="Music Sound Loop">              The basic XHTML code to use the   tag to embed a sound loop within a player  A sample page using this   tag can be found in the student files   chapter11 musicbase.html . See Figure 11.2 for a screenshot of this page displayed in  the Chrome  left screenshot  and Internet Explorer  right screenshot  browsers. If you  see warning messages when the object element is used to play media, click through the  warning message and consider consulting your network administrator or lab support  staff for recommended security settings and or plug-in installation.  Figure  11.2  The  Google  Chrome  browser   left  screenshot   correctly  renders  the  multimedia object;  the Internet Explorer browser  right screenshot  does not properly confi gure the object  Review Figure 11.2 . Notice that the Chrome browser  left screenshot  correctly renders  the object element and displays a media player for the MP3. However, even though the  11.3 XHTML Object and Param Elements  441  XHTML is valid and satisfies W3C recommendations, Internet Explorer    right screenshot  does not properly configure the object. Don’t worry, there is a  solution for this issue: Configure another object element that only Internet Explorer  will process. This technique is described by Elizabeth Castro in “Bye Bye Embed”    http:  www.alistapart.com articles byebyeembed  .  Internet Explorer requires the classid attribute  to indicate the player’s ActiveX control   and its associated codebase attribute in order to properly render an object element  configured for audio or video files. The code to play an audio file with QuickTime  Castro describes a technique in her article that uses both   tags, along with  conditional comments  which only Internet Explorer follows , to direct non-Internet  Explorer browsers to the standard code. The solution  see chapter11 music.html in the  within Internet Explorer is  type="audio mpeg"  <object data="soundloop.mp3" height="50" width="100"  classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"  codebase="http:  www.apple.com qtactivex qtplugin.cab">              student files  is  type="audio mpeg"  <object data="soundloop.mp3" height="50" width="100"  classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"  codebase="http:  www.apple.com qtactivex qtplugin.cab">            -->  type="audio mpeg">  <object data="soundloop.mp3" height="50" width="100"                    Browsers render in a top-down, line-by-line manner. Only Internet Explorer understands  the conditional comments. In this case, the conditional comment indicates that Internet  Explorer should ignore the code within the comments. The conditional comment begins  with  --> and ends with   . So, Internet Explorer will  render the first   tag and skip the second, while other browsers will process  one after another  within the same area in the browser viewport  and render using the  code from the second   tag. If this sounds complicated, it is! Life would be so  much less complex if browsers behaved in a more similar manner. You’ll get some expe-  rience with the object element in the next Hands-On Practice.   442  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Hands-On Practice 11.2  In this Hands-On Practice, you will create a web page that displays a controller to play a sound   see  Figure  11.3   chapter11 music1.mp3    .  Copy   the  music1.mp3  audio   fi   le   from   the  student   fi   les  and save the fi le in a folder named music. Launch a text editor and open the XHTML web page  template found in the student fi les  chapter2 templatex.html .  1. Confi gure a relevant page title.  2. Code an h1 element with the text “Playing Sounds with the Object Tag”.  3. Use the   tag and   tag to confi gure a console that lets the web page  visitor control the audio fi le. Use the previous code and the list of attributes and values in  Table 11.3 and Table 11.4 as a guide. Save your web page as objectaudio.html in the music  folder and test it in a browser.  4. Experiment with the object element’s width attribute: Try the values 25, 50, 100, and 110, and  notice how the display of the controller changes. Explore the param element’s autoplay value  to confi gure the sound to automatically play when the page loads. Use the param element’s  loop value to cause the sound to loop continuously. Test your web page in different browsers,  using different versions. Compare your work to chapter11 object.html in the student fi les.  Figure 11.3 This page uses the object element with width=“50”  FAQ How can I make a podcast?  Podcasts are audio files on the web that may take the format of an audio blog, radio show, or  interview. There are three steps in publishing a podcast:  1. Record the podcast. The Windows and Mac operating systems contain audio recording  utilities. Apple’s Quicktime Pro  available at http:  apple.com quicktime pro for both Windows  and Mac  is a low-cost application that can be used to record audio. If you are using a Mac,  another option is Apple’s GarageBand, which is a pre-installed music application that offers  a range of options for recording and editing audio. Audacity is a free cross-platform digital  audio editor  available at http:  audacity.sourceforge.net for both Windows and Mac . You can use Audacity to record your voice for a podcast and mix in music loops to add interest. Once  the  WAV  file  is  created,  the  LAME  encoder     http:  lame.sourceforge.net    or  a  similar application can be used to convert to an MP3 format.   2. Upload the podcast. Upload the MP3 to your website. If your web host does not permit  MP3 files, an alternative is to upload to a site that accepts audio files at no cost such as  Internet Archive   http:  www.archive.org   or OurMedia   http:  ourmedia.org  .  3. Make the podcast available. The most straightforward method is to code a hyperlink to  the audio file. The hyperlink allows website visitors to access the podcast MP3 file, but does  11.3 XHTML Object and Param Elements  443  not make the podcast available for subscription. An RSS feed must be created in order for  your visitors to subscribe to your current and future podcasts. An RSS feed for a podcast  is an XML file that lists information about your podcast. With a bit of patience, you can  code your own RSS feed using a text editor  see Stephen Downes’s website at  http:  www.downes.ca cgi-bin page.cgi?post=56 or Robin Good’s website at  http:  www.masternewmedia.org news 2006 03 09 how_to_create_a_rss.htm  . However,  a number of websites, such as FeedBurner   http:  feedburner.google.com  , and IceRocket    http:  rss.icerocket.com  , provide a service that generates and hosts the RSS feed for you.  After the RSS feed is uploaded to the Web  either your own or the RSS feed generator’s site ,  you can code a link to the RSS file. Apple provides instructions for submitting your podcast to  iTunes at http:  apple.com itunes whatson podcasts specs.html . Web visitors using software  such as Apple’s iTunes or a free RSS feed reader website such as FeedReader3    http:  feedreader.com   can locate and automatically download your podcast.  Video on a Web Page  Embedding video using an object element and param element is  similar to embedding audio in a web page. Refer to the previous  section for an overview of these elements. The code in this section  uses XHTML syntax. Keep in mind that the object and param ele-  ments may also be used in HTML5, although HTML5 introduces new  audio and video elements that you’ll explore in the next section. A  sample page using the object element to display a video can be  found in the student files  chapter11 video.html  and is shown in  Figure 11.4 .  The page was created using Castro’s technique  Figure 11.4 Playing a video fi le    http:  www.alistapart.com articles byebyeembed   of coding two    tags and using Internet Explorer conditional comments.  The code to play the sparky.mov video with QuickTime is   <object data="sparky.mov" height="150" width="160"  type="video quicktime"  classid="clsid:02BF25D5–8C17–4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"  codebase="http:  www.apple.com qtactivex qtplugin.cab"  title="Video of a cute Pekingese dog barking">            -->  <object data="sparky.mov" height="150" width="160"  type="video quicktime"  title="Video of a cute Pekingese dog barking">            A video of a cute Pekingese dog barking.            444  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Depending on your browser plug-ins, the video may not display on this page using the    tag. The sample pages were tested using the QuickTime plug-in for MOV  files. This plug-in issue can be a problem for video components. Testing with your  target audience in mind, as well as giving your visitors hints on the most appropriate  plug-ins, will help.  What happens if a browser or other user agent cannot display the video? Carefully re-  view the code and notice that there is a descriptive phrase coded before each closing    tag. This phrase will display on the web page if the object  in this case, the   video player  cannot be rendered. Also, to help provide accessibility, the title attribute  has been configured with a brief text description of the video. This area will be read by  some assistive technologies such as screen readers.  Hands-On Practice 11.3  In this Hands-On Practice, you will create the web page shown in Figure 11.5 , which uses the  object and param elements to play a video clip for a web page visitor. Copy the lighthouse.mov  fi le from the chapter11 folder in the student fi les and save the fi le in a folder named movie.  Launch a text editor and open the XHTML web page template found in the student fi les   chatper2 templatex.html .  1. Confi gure a relevant page title.  2. Code an h1 element with the text “Door County Lighthouse Tours”.  3. Use the   tag and   tag to confi gure a console that lets the web page  visitor control the audio fi le. Use the previous code and the list of attributes and values in  Table 11.3 and Table 11.4 as a guide. Save your web page as objectvideo.html in the movie  folder and test it in a browser.  4. Experiment with the object element’s height and width attributes. Explore the param ele-  ment’s autoplay and loop attributes. Test your web page in different browsers, using  different versions. Compare your work to the student fi les  chapter11 lighthouse.html .  Figure 11.5 Using the   tag to embed video  11.3 XHTML Object and Param Elements  445  Working with Multimedia on the Web  More About Audio Files  There are a number of ways that you can obtain audio files. You can record your own  sounds, download sounds or music from a free site, record music from a CD, or pur-  chase a DVD of sounds. There are some ethical issues related to using sounds and  music created by others. You may only publish sounds or music that you have cre-  ated yourself or for which you have obtained the rights  sometimes called a license   to publish. When you purchase a CD or DVD, you have not purchased the rights for  publishing to the Web. Contact the owner of the copyright to request permission to  Focus on  Ethics  use the music.  There are many sources of audio files on the Web. Some offer free files, such as  Microsoft’s Clip Art and Media   http:  office.microsoft.com clipart  , Loopasonic    http:  www.loopasonic.com  , and FreeAudioClips.com   http:  www.freeaudioclips.com  .  Others, like SoundRangers   http:  www.soundrangers.com  , may offer one or two free  sounds, but ultimately they are in the business of selling soundtracks and CDs. An inter-   esting resource for free sound is the Flash Kit site   http:  www.flashkit.com  ; click on  the Sound Loops link. While this site is intended for Adobe Flash developers, the sound  files can be used without Flash.  Audio files can be quite large and it is important to be aware of the amount of time re-  quired to download them for play. If you decide to use an audio file on a web page,  make it as brief as possible. If you are recording your own audio files, be aware that the  sampling rate and bit depth will affect the file size. A sampling rate is a value related to  the number of digital sound samples taken per second when the sound is recorded. It is  measured in kilohertz  kHz . Common sampling rates vary from 8 kHz  AM radio quality  sound or sound effects  to 44.1 kHz  music CD quality sound . As you would expect, a  sound recorded at 44.1 kHz has a much larger file size than a sound recorded at 8 kHz.  Bit depth or resolution is another factor in audio file size. A sound recorded with 8-bit  resolution  useful for a voice or other simple sounds  will have a smaller file size than a  sound recorded using 16-bit resolution  music CD quality .  The Windows and Mac operating systems contain audio recording utilities. Audacity is a free  cross-platform digital audio editor  available at http:  audacity.sourceforge.net for both  Windows and Mac . Apple’s Quicktime Pro  available at http:  apple.com quicktime pro  for both Windows and Mac  is a low-cost application that can be used to record  audio. If you are using a Mac, another option is Apple’s GarageBand, which is a  low-cost music application that offers a range of options for recording and  editing audio. Apple provides tutorials and documentation for GarageBand  see  http:  www.apple.com support garageband podcasts recording for a tutorial about  podcasting with GarageBand .  More About Video Files  Just as with audio files, there are a number of ways that you can obtain video files,  including recording your own, downloading videos, purchasing a DVD that contains  videos, or searching for video files on the Web. Be aware that there are ethical issues  related to using videos that you did not create yourself. You must obtain the rights or  license to publish videos created by other individuals before publishing them on your  Focus on  Ethics  website.  446  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Many digital cameras have the capability to take still photographs as well as short  MP4 movies. This can be an easy way to create short video clips. Digital video cam-  eras and webcams record digital videos. Once you have created your video, software  such as Adobe Premiere   http:  www.adobe.com products premiere  ,  Apple QuickTime Pro   http:  www.apple.com quicktime pro  , Apple iMovie    http:  www.apple.com ilife imovie  , or Microsoft Movie Maker    http:  windows.microsoft.com en-US windows7 products features movie-maker    can be used   to edit and configure your video masterpiece. Many digital cameras and smartphones provide the ability record to videos and immediately upload them to YouTube to  share with the world. You’ll work with a YouTube video in Chapter 13 .  Multimedia and Accessibility Issues  Provide alternate content for the media files you use on your website in transcript, caption,  or printable PDF format. Provide a text transcript for audio files such as podcasts. Often, you  can use the podcast script as the basis of the text transcript file that you create as a PDF and  Focus on  Accessibility  upload to your website. Provide captions for video files. Applications such as Media Access  Generator  MAGpie  can add captioning to videos. See the National Center for Accessible  Media’s website   http:  ncam.wgbh.org webaccess magpie   for the most up-to-date infor-  mation on the application.

Browser Compatibility Issues  As you completed the Hands-On Practice, you may have encountered playback issues in  various browsers. Playing audio and video files on the Web depends on the plug-ins in-  stalled in your visitor’s web browsers. A page that works perfectly on your home computer  may not work for all visitors; it depends on the configuration of the computer. Some visi-  tors will not have the plug-ins properly installed. Some visitors may have file types associ-  ated with incorrect plug-ins or incorrectly installed plug-ins. Some visitors may be using  low bandwidth and have to wait an overly long time for your media file to download. Are  you detecting a pattern here? Sometimes media on the Web can be problematic.  In a response to these browser plug-in compatibility issues and in an effort to reduce re-  liance on a proprietary technology like Adobe Flash, HTML5 introduces new audio and  video elements that are native to the browser. However, because HTML5 is not yet sup-  ported by commonly used browsers  such as older versions of Internet Explorer , web  designers still need to provide a fallback option, such as providing a hyperlink to the  media file or displaying a Flash version of the multimedia. You’ll work with HTML5 audio  and video later in this chapter, but first, let’s explore Adobe Flash.  11.4  Adobe Flash  Adobe Flash is a popular application used to create multimedia that adds visual interest  and interactivity to web pages with slide shows, animation, and multimedia effects.   11.4 Adobe Flash  447  Flash animation is stored in a file with a .swf file exten-  sion. Unlike other media, SWF files play as they download  and give the perception of speedy display of complex  graphic animation. The animation can be as simple as the  Flash effect shown in Figure 11.6  see chapter11 flash1.html  in the student files . Flash can also be used to play audio  and video files, and to create many more complex effects,  including full-screen animation, banner ads, and interac-  tive site navigation using integrated audio clips. Flash  Figure 11.6 This web page displays a Flash SWF fi le  animation can be interactive; it can be scripted, with a  language called ActionScript, to respond to mouse clicks,  accept information in text boxes, and invoke server-side scripting.  Flash requires a browser plug-in, which is free and readily available for download  from Adobe. According to Adobe, 99% of Internet-enabled desktops have a Flash plug-in  installed   http:  adobe.com products player_census flashplayer  . Recall that playing standard format audio and video files on web pages is extremely dependent on the  browser plug-ins that visitors have installed. There was increased use of Adobe Flash  technology to play audio and video files on web pages until the Apple iPhone and  iPad were released without Flash support. However, Flash is supported by other  mobile devices such as Android tablets, Android smartphones, and RIM’s Blackberry  Playbook.  Flash can be used to create interactive ads on web pages that respond to a visitor’s  mouse movements with sound and animation. The results of a study by DoubleClick    http:  static.googleusercontent.com external_content untrusted_dlcp   www.google.com en us doubleclick pdfs DoubleClick-06-2009-The-Brand-Value-of-Rich-  Media-and-Video-Ads.pdf   about the value of rich media ads indicated that rich media  such as Flash with video  increases brand awareness, brand favorability, and purchase  intent significantly more than other types of ads such as plain image ads or simple Flash  banners. Flash can also be used to create entire websites, including navigation, content,  and  forms.  A  compelling  example  is  2Advanced  Studios     http:  2advanced.com  .  All  the interactivity—navigation, animation, and content—is coded in the Flash SWF file.  Adobe licenses the Adobe Flash file format to third-party developers. This means that you  can use applications other than Adobe Flash to create a Flash  SWF file  effect. TechSmith’s  Camtasia   http:  www.techsmith.com   and SWiSH   http:  www.swishzone.com   are just  two of the third-party tools that can be used to create media in the SWF format.  Today’s web developer needs to know how to add a Flash SWF file to a web page. If you  are working on a large project, a graphic designer may create the effect and pass it to  you for placement on a page. If you are working on a small project, you may be expected  to create Flash SWF files yourself. Adobe offers a free trial download of the Flash appli-  cation, including a few tutorials and lessons on using Flash.  Flash Animation on a Web Page  Modern desktop browsers support the display of Flash media with the object and param  elements. As previously discussed, the object element is a multipurpose tag for adding   various types of objects to a web page. The object element’s attributes vary, depending  on the type of object being referenced. The minimum attributes required when working  Optional; specifies a hotkey for keyboard access: Windows users press the  hotkey and the Ctrl key at the same time  with Flash media are described in Table 11.5 .  448  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Table 11.5 Minimal Flash media attributes  Attribute  accesskey  Description and Value  The MIME type of the object; use  type="application x-shockwave-flash"  File name of the Flash media  SWF file   Specifies the height of the object area in pixels  Optional; a numeric value that specifies the tabbing order of the Flash media  Optional; specifies a brief text description that may be displayed by browsers  or assistive technologies  Specifies the width of the object area in pixels  The Flash object uses special values, called parameters, to configure the name of the  SWF file, the quality of the media, and the background color of the page areas. These  are configured with   tags. The parameters used with Flash media are shown in  Table 11.6 Flash media parameters  Description and Value  File name of the Flash media  SWF file   Optional; describes the quality of the media; usually the value “high” is used  Optional; background color of the Flash media area; uses a hexadecimal  Optional; indicates whether the SWF loops; values are “true” and “false”  Optional; configures the transparent background of the Flash media area in  browsers that support this feature; the value is “transparent”  The following code configures the Flash SWF file shown in Figure 11.6 :  type  data  height  title  width  tabindex  Table 11.6 .  Parameter  movie  quality  bgcolor  color value  loop  wmode   <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="flashlogo.swf"  width="300" height="70">            Add a little Flash to your web page.      Notice the code placed before the closing   tag in the previous example. It is  displayed if the browser does not support the multimedia object. Include a link to a web  page that contains alternate text content if needed. While the developers of assistive  technologies such as screen readers are working toward the support of Flash media, it is  not yet universal.  11.4 Adobe Flash  449  Hands-On Practice 11.4  Figure 11.7 Flash slide  show of images  In  this  Hands-On  Practice,  you  will  create  a  web  page  that  displays  a  Flash  slide  show  of photo-  graphs. Your web page will look like the one shown in Figure 11.7 .  Let’s get started. Create a folder called lighthouse. Copy the lighthouse.swf file from the  student files  chapter11 starters folder  and save it in your lighthouse folder. Use the  chapter2 template.html file as a starting point and create a web page with the heading “Door  County Lighthouse Cruise” and the appropriate object and param elements to display a  Flash file named lighthouse.swf, which is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high.  The code is  <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="lighthouse.swf"   Save your web page as lighthouse2.html and test it in a browser. Compare your work to the  width="320" height="240" title="Door County Lighthouse Cruise">            Door County Lighthouse Cruise      student files chapter11 lighthouse lighthouse.html .  HTML5 Embed Element  Although used for many years to configure  media and Flash on web pages, the embed  element was never an official W3C element until  HTML5. One of the design principles of HTML5  is to “pave the cowpaths,” meaning to smooth  the way for the valid use of techniques that,  although supported by browsers, were not part  Figure 11.8 The embed element was used to confi gure the  Flash media  of the official W3C standard. Figure 11.8  see  chapter11 flashembed.html in the student files   shows a web page using an embed element to display a Flash SWF file.  450  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  The embed element is a self-contained, or void, element that provides a way to add con-  tent that requires a plug-in or player to a web page. The embed element can be used to  display a Flash SWF file on a web page. The attributes of the embed element commonly  used with Flash media are listed in Table 11.7 .   src  height  type  width  bgcolor  quality  title  technologies  wmode  src="fall5.swf"  width="640"  height="100"  quality="high"  Focus on  Accessibility  Table 11.7 Embed element attributes  Attribute  Description and Value  File name of the Flash media  SWF file   Specifies the height of the object area in pixels  The MIME type of the object; use type="application x-shockwave-flash"  Specifies the width of the object area in pixels  Optional; hexadecimal value for the background color of the Flash  Optional; describes the quality of the media, usually set to “high”  Optional; specifies a brief text description that may be displayed by browsers or assistive  Optional; set to “transparent” to configure a transparent background in supporting browsers  The following code configures the Flash SWF file shown in Figure 11.7 :  <embed type="application x-shockwave-flash"  title="Fall Nature Hikes">  Notice the value of the title attribute in the previous code. The descriptive text could be  accessed by assistive technologies such as a screen reader.  Hands-On Practice 11.5  In this Hands-On Practice, you will launch a text editor and create a web page that displays a  Flash slide show of photographs. Your web page will look like the one shown in Figure 11.9 .  Figure 11.9 Flash slide  show of images confi gured  with the embed element   11.4 Adobe Flash  451  Create a folder called embed. Copy the lighthouse.swf file from the student files   chapter11 starters folder  and save it in your embed folder. Use the chapter2 template.html  file as a starting point and create a web page with the heading “Door County Lighthouse  Cruise” and an embed element to display a Flash file named lighthouse.swf that is 320 pixels  wide and 240 pixels high. The code is  <embed type="application x-shockwave-flash"  src="lighthouse.swf" quality="high"  width="320" height="240"  title="Door County Lighthouse Cruise">  Save your web page as index.html in the embed folder and test it in a browser. Compare your  work to chapter11 lighthouse embed.html in the student files.  Flash Resources  There are many sources of free Flash animation and Flash tutorials on the Web. In addi-  tion to resources at the Adobe site   http:  adobe.com  , the following websites contain  tutorials and news about Flash:  ● Flash Kit: http:  flashkit.com  ● ActionScript: http:  www.actionscript.org  ● ScriptOcean: http:  www.scriptocean.com flashn.html  ● Kirupa: http:  www.kirupa.com developer flash index.htm  As you visit these and other Flash resource sites, keep in mind that some Flash  media is copyrighted. Obtain permission from the creator of the media before using  it on your site and follow any instructions for giving credit to the source. Some  sites allow personal use of their Flash media for free, but require licenses for  Focus on  Ethics  commercial use.  Focus on  Accessibility  Adobe has been working toward increasing the accessibility of Flash objects. Recent  versions of Flash are accessible to assistive technologies, such as the Window-Eyes  screen reader, enabling rich content for a wider audience of web page visitors. Flash  supports Microsoft Active Accessibility  MSAA , which provides both a standard  method for client technology to communicate with assistive technologies and a  technique for developers to use to ensure that the client software that they create in  compliance with this standard can include Adobe Flash support. Visit Adobe’s website     http:  www.adobe.com accessibility products flash    for  the  most  up-to-date  information  on the issue of Flash accessibility.  FAQ What’s Microsoft Silverlight?  Silverlight   http:  www.silverlight.net   is a plug-in for delivering media experiences and rich  interactive applications for the Web. Microsoft Expression Blend is an application that creates   interactive media for display by the Silverlight plug-in.  452  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  FAQ What will happen if the browser my web page visitor uses does not  support Flash?  If you used the code in this section to display Flash media on a web page and your visitor’s  browser does not support Flash, the browser typically will display a message about the need  for a missing plug-in. The code in this section passes W3C validation and is the minimum code  needed to display Flash media on a web page. If you’d like more features, such as being able  to offer an express installation of the latest Flash player to your visitors, explore SWFObject    http:  code.google.com p swfobject wiki documentation  , which uses JavaScript to embed  Flash content and is W3C standards compliant.  At the time this was written, there was no Flash support for the iPhone, iTouch, or iPad;  however, these devices have been configured to support the new HTML5 audio and video  elements that are introduced in the next section.  Checkpoint 11.1  1. List three common web browser plug-ins and describe their use.  2. Describe the issues involved with adding media such as audio or video to a web page.  3. Describe a disadvantage of using Flash on a web page.  11.5  HTML5 Audio and Video Elements  The new HTML5 audio and video elements enable browsers to natively play media files  without the need for browser plug-ins. When working with native HTML5 audio and  video, you need to be aware of the container  which is designated by the file extension   and the codec  which is the algorithm used to compress the media . Refer to Table 11.1  and Table 11.2 , which list common media file extensions, the container file type, and a  description with codec information  if applicable for HTML5 . If this were a perfect world,  all browsers would support all media codecs. Well, it’s not perfect and there is no single  codec that is supported by all popular browsers. For example, the H.264 codec requires  licensing fees and is not supported by the Firefox and Opera web browsers, which sup-  port OGG and WebM. Internet Explorer and Safari support the H.264 video, but do not  support OGG or WebM. At the time this was written, the Google Chrome browser sup-  ported H.264, OGG, and WebM, but planned to drop support of H.264 in the future.  See http:  www.ibm.com developerworks web library wa-html5video index.html?ca=  drs-table2 for an up-to-date browser compatibility chart. When you work with HTML5  audio and video, you’ll need to offer multiple versions of the media file in various  containers codecs. Let’s get started using the HTML5 audio element.   Audio Element  The new HTML5 audio element supports native play of audio files in the browser without  the need for plug-ins or players. The audio element begins with the   tag and  ends with the   tag. Table 11.8 lists the attributes of the audio element.  11.5 HTML5 Audio and Video Elements  Table 11.8 Audio element attributes  Optional; audio file name  Optional; the MIME type of the audio file, such as audio mpeg  Optional; indicates whether audio should start playing automatically;  Optional; indicates whether controls should be displayed;  453  Attribute  Value  Usage  src  File name  type  MIME type  or audio ogg  autoplay  autoplay  use with caution  controls  controls  recommended  preload  none , metadata ,  loop  loop  auto  title  Optional; indicates whether audio should be played over and over  Optional; values: none  no preload , metadata  only download media  file metadata , and auto  download the media file   Text description  Optional; specifies a brief text description that may be displayed by  browsers or assistive technologies  You’ll need to supply multiple versions of the audio file because of the browser support   of different codecs. Plan to supply audio files in at least two different containers, includ-  ing OGG and MP3. It is typical to omit the src and type attributes from the audio tag  and, instead, configure multiple versions of the audio file with the source element.  Source Element  The source element is a self-contained, or void, tag that specifies a media file and a  MIME type. The src attribute identifies the file name of the media file. The type at-  tribute indicates the MIME type of the file. Code type="audio mpeg" for an MP3 file.  Code type="audio ogg" for audio files using the Vorbis codec. Configure a source ele-  ment for each version of the audio file. Place the source element before the closing  audio tag.  HTML5 Audio on a Web Page  The following code configures the web page shown in Figure 11.10  see chapter11 audio.  html in the student files  to display a controller for an audio file:            Download the Audio File   MP3      Figure 11.10  Internet Explorer 9  supports the  HTML5 audio  element  454  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Current versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera also support the HTML5 audio  element. While Internet Explorer 9 supports the audio element, earlier versions of  Internet Explorer offer no support. The controls displayed by  each browser are different.   Review the previous code and note the hyperlink placed  between the second source element and the closing audio tag.  Any HTML elements or text placed in this area is rendered by  browsers that do not support the HTML5 audio element. This is  referred to as fallback content; if the audio element is not  supported, the MP3 version of the file is made available for  download. Figure 11.11 shows a screen shot of Internet Explorer  Figure 11.11 Internet Explorer 8 does not  recognize the audio element  8 displaying the web page.  Hands-On Practice 11.6  Figure 11.12 Using the  audio element to provide  access to a podcast  In  this  Hands-On  Practice,  you  will  launch  a  text  editor  and  create  a  web  page   see  Figure 11.12    that displays an audio control to play a podcast.  Copy the podcast.mp3, podcast.ogg, and podcast.txt files from the chapter11 starters folder  in the student files and save them to a folder named audio5. Use the chapter2 template.html  file as a starting point and create a web page with the heading “Web Design Podcast”, an  audio control  use the audio element and two source elements , and a hyperlink to the text  transcript. Configure a hyperlink to the MP3 file as the fallback content. The code for the  audio element is            Download the Podcast   MP3      Save your web page as index.html in the audio5 folder and display it in a browser.  Test your web page in different browsers, using different versions. Recall that Internet  Explorer versions prior to Version 9 do not support the audio element, but they will display  the fallback content. When you click on the hyperlink for the text transcript, the text will  display in the browser. Compare your work to chapter11 podcast podcast5.html in the  student files.  11.5 HTML5 Audio and Video Elements  455  FAQ How can I convert an audio file to the Ogg Vorbis codec?  The  http:  audacity.sourceforge.net  open-source   Audacity   application   supports   Ogg   Vorbis.   See  for download information. If you’re looking for a free Web-based converter, you can upload and  share an audio file at the Internet Archive   http:  www.archive.org   and an OGG format file will  automatically be generated.   The new HTML5 video element supports native play of video files in the browser without  the need for plug-ins or players. The video element begins with the   tag and  ends with the   tag. Table 11.9 lists the attributes of the video element.  Table 11.9 Video element attributes  Video Element  Attribute  Value  Usage  src  File name  type  MIME type  or video ogg  autoplay  autoplay  use with caution  controls  controls  recommended  height  number  loop  loop  poster  File name  the video  preload  auto  title  width  Number  Optional; video file name  Optional; the MIME type of the video file, such as video mp4  Optional; indicates whether video should start playing automatically;  Optional; indicates whether controls should be displayed;  Optional; video height in pixels  Optional; indicates whether video should be played over and over  Optional; specifies an image to display if the browser cannot play  none , metadata ,  Optional; values: none  no preload , metadata  only download media  file metadata , and auto  download the media file   Text description  Optional; specifies a brief text description that may be displayed by  browsers or assistive technologies  Optional; video width in pixels   You’ll need to supply multiple versions of the video file because of the browser sup-  port of different codecs. Plan to supply video files in at least two different containers,  including MP4 and OGG  or OGV . It is typical to omit the src and type attributes from  the video tag and, instead, configure multiple versions of the audio file with the  source element.  Source Element  Recall from the previous section that the source element is a self-contained, or void, tag  that specifies a media file and a MIME type. The src attribute identifies the file name of  the media file. The type attribute indicates the MIME type of the file. Code  type="video mp4" for video files using the MP4 codec. Code type="video ogg" for  video files using the Theora codec. Configure a source element for each version of the  video file. Place the source elements before the closing video tag.  456  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  HTML5 Video on a Web Page  The following code configures the web page shown in Figure 11.13   chapter11 sparky2.html in the student files  with the native HTML5 browser   controls to display and play a video:  <video controls="controls" poster="sparky.jpg"  width="160" height="150">         Sparky the Dog   .mov      browser  Figure 11.13 The Opera  Current versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera support the HTML5 video  element. Internet Explorer 9 supports the video element, but earlier versions do  not. The controls displayed by each browser are different. Review the code just  given and note the anchor element placed between the second source element  and the closing video tag. Any HTML elements or text placed in this area is ren-  dered by browsers that do not support the HTML5 video element. This is referred  to as fallback content. In this case, a hyperlink to a QuickTime  .mov  version of  the file is supplied for the user to download. Another fallback option is to con-  figure an embed element to play a Flash SWF version of the video. Figure 11.14  Figure 11.14 Internet  Explorer 8 displays the  fallback option  shows Internet Explorer 8 displaying the web page.  Hands-On Practice 11.7  In this Hands-On Practice, you will launch a text editor and create the web page in Figure 11.15 ,  VideoNote  HTML5 Video  which displays a video control to play a movie.  Figure 11.15 HTML5 video element  Copy the lighthouse.m4v, lighthouse.ogv, lighthouse.swf, and lighthouse.jpg files from the  chapter11 starters folder in the student files and save them to a folder named video. Open  chapter2 template.html  in  a  text  editor  and  configure  a  web  page  with  the  heading “Lighthouse  Cruise” and a video control  use the video element and two source elements . While we could  configure a hyperlink to a video file as fallback content, in this example, we’ll configure an  embed element to display the Flash media file  lighthouse.swf  as fallback content. Configure the  11.6 Multimedia Files and Copyright Law  457   lighthouse.jpg  file  as  a  poster  image,  which  will  display  if  the  browser  supports  the  video element,  but it cannot play any of the video files. The code for the video element is  <video controls="controls" poster="lighthouse.jpg" width="320"  height="240">        <embed type="application x-shockwave-fl ash"  src="lighthouse.swf" quality="high" width="320" height="240"  title="Door County Lighthouse Cruise">     Save your web page as index.html in the video folder and display it in a browser. Test your web  page in different browsers. Compare your work to Figure 11.15 and chapter11 video video.html  in the student files.  FAQ How can I convert a video file to the new codecs?  You can use Firefogg   http:  firefogg.org   to convert your video file to the Ogg Theora codec.  Online-Convert  offers  free  conversion  to  WebM     http:  video.online-convert.com convert-to- webm  .  The free, open-source MiroVideoConverter   http:  www.mirovideoconverter.com   can convert most video files to MP4, WebM, or OGG formats.  11.6  Multimedia Files and Copyright Law  It is very easy to copy and download an image, audio, or video file from a website. It  may be very tempting to place someone else’s file in one of your own projects, but that  may not be ethical or lawful. Only publish web pages, images, and other media that you  Focus on  Ethics  have personally created or have obtained the rights or license to use.

The Creative Commons license informs others ex-  actly what they can and cannot do with the creative work.  Recall from Chapter 6 that the CSS :hover pseudo-class provides a way to configure  styles to display when the web page visitor moves the mouse over an element. You’ll  use this basic interactivity, along with CSS positioning and display properties, to config-  ure an interactive image gallery with CSS and HTML. Figure 11.16 shows the gallery in ac-  tion  see chapter11 gallery gallery.html in the student files . When you place the mouse  over a thumbnail image, the larger version of the image is displayed, along with a cap-  tion. If you click on the thumbnail, the image displays in its own browser window.  11.7  CSS3 and Interactivity  CSS Image Gallery  Figure 11.16 An  interactive image  gallery with CSS  Hands-On Practice 11.8  In this Hands-On Practice, you will create the image gallery web page in Figure 11.16 . Copy the  following images from the chapter11 starters folder in the student fi les: photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg,  photo3.jpg, photo4.jpg, photo5.jpg, photo6.jpg, photo1thumb.jpg, photo2thumb.jpg,  photo3thumb.jpg, photo4thumb.jpg, photo5thumb.jpg, and photo6thumb.jpg. Save them  to a folder named gallery.  Launch a text editor and modify chapter2 template.html to configure a web page as indicated:  1. Confi gure the text “Image Gallery” within an h1 element.  2. Code a div assigned to the id named gallery. This div will contain the thumbnail images.   3. Confi gure an unordered list within the div. Code six li elements, one for each thumbnail  image. The thumbnail images will function as image links with a :hover pseudo-class that  11.7 CSS3 and Interactivity  459  causes the larger image to display on the page. We’ll make this all happen by confi guring a  hyperlink element that contains both the thumbnail image and a span element that comprises  the larger image, along with descriptive text. An example of the fi rst li element is    <img src="photo1thumb.jpg"  width="100" height="75" alt="Golden Gate Bridge">   <img src="photo1.jpg" width="400" height="300"  alt="Golden Gate Bridge"> Golden Gate Bridge       4. Confi gure all six li elements in a similar manner. Substitute the actual name of each image fi le  for the href and src values in the code. Write your own descriptive text for each image. Use  photo2.jpg and photo2thumb.jpg in the second li element. Use photo3.jpg and photo-  3thumb.jpg in the third li element, and so on. Save the fi le as index.html in the gallery folder.  Display your web page in a browser. You’ll see an unordered list with the thumbnail images,  the larger images, and the descriptive text. Figure 11.17 shows a partial screen capture.  Figure 11.17 The  web page display  before CSS  5. Now, let’s add embedded CSS. Open your fi le in a text editor and code a style element in the  head section. The gallery id will use relative positioning. This does not change the location of  the gallery, but instead sets the stage to use absolute positioning on the span element in  relation to its container   gallery   instead of in relation to the entire web page document.   This won’t matter too much for our very basic example, but it would be very helpful if the  gallery was part of a more complex web page. Code embedded CSS to confi gure the gallery  with relative positioning; the unordered list with a width of 300 pixels and no list marker; the  list items with inline display, left fl oat, and 10 pixels of padding; the images with no border;  460  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  the anchor tags with no underline, dark gray color  333 , and italic font; and the span to not  display by default. The CSS is  gallery { position: relative; }  gallery ul { width: 300px;  list-style-type: none; }  gallery li { display: inline;  fl oat: left;  padding: 10px; }  gallery img { border-style: none; }  gallery a { text-decoration: none;  color: 333;  font-style: italic; }  gallery span {display: none; }  position: absolute;  top: 10px;  left: 300px;  text-align: center; }  Next, confi gure the span to display only when the web visitor hovers the mouse over the  thumbnail image link. Set the location of the span to use absolute positioning. Locate the span  10 pixels down from the top and 300 pixels in from the left. Center the text within the span:  gallery a:hover span { display: block;  Save your web page and display it in a browser. Your gallery should work well in modern brows-  ers. Note that the outdated Internet Explorer 6 does not support the dynamic display of the  larger image, but instead displays the unordered list and processes the thumbnail image links.  Compare your work to Figure 11.16 and chapter11 gallery gallery.html in the student files.  CSS3 Transform Property  CSS3 provides a method to change or transform the display of an element. The  transform property allows you to rotate, scale, skew, or move an element. Both  two-dimensional  2D  and three-dimensional  3D  transforms are possible.  Transforms are often used in conjunction with the CSS3 transition property   introduced in the next section .  Developers of browser-rendering engines, such as WebKit  used by Safari and Google  Chrome  and Gecko  used by Firefox and other Mozilla-based browsers , have created  their own proprietary properties to implement the transform property. So, you need to  code multiple style declarations to configure a transform:  ● -webkit-transform  for Webkit browsers   ● -moz-transform  for Gecko browsers   ● -o-transform  for the Opera browser   ● -ms-transform  for Internet Explorer 9    ● transform  W3C draft syntax   11.7 CSS3 and Interactivity  461  Eventually, all browsers will support CSS3 and the transform property,  so code this property last in the list. The web page in Figure 11.18  see  chapter11 transform transform.html in the student files  demonstrates the use of the  CSS3 transform property to slightly rotate the figure. CSS is also used to configure a  border, text caption, and box shadow for the div that contains the image.  Figure 11.18 The  transform property  in action  Configuring a CSS3 Rotation Transform  The rotate   transform type takes a value in degrees  like an angle in geometry . Rotate to  the right with a positive value. Rotate to the left with a negative value. The rotation is around  the origin, which, by default, is the middle of the element. The following CSS code first config-  ures a class named figure to float to the right, with a 260 pixel width; 20 pixel margin; 5 pix-  els of padding; a white background; a gray, solid 1 pixel border; and centered text 0.80em in  size. CSS3 is configured next to rotate 3 degrees and apply a box shadow. The code is  .figure { float: right;  width: 260px;  margin: 20px;  padding: 5px;  background-color: FFF;  border: 1px solid CCC;  text-align: center;  font-size: 0.80em;  -webkit-transform: rotate 3deg ;  -moz-transform: rotate 3deg ;  -o-transform: rotate 3deg ;  -ms-transform: rotate 3deg ;   transform: rotate 3deg ;  -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 828282;  -moz-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 828282;  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 828282; }  462  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Recall that the browser proprietary CSS syntax in this section is nonstandard. Your CSS  code will not pass W3C validation when you use these properties.  This section provided an overview of one type of transform: the rotation of  an element.

Four different properties can be used with transitions:  transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function ,  and transition-delay . The properties can be combined in a single shorthand  transition property . Table 11.10 lists the transition properties and their purpose.  Table 11.10 CSS transition properties  Property  Description  transition-property  Indicates the CSS property to which the transition  applies; a list of applicable properties is available at  http:  www.w3.org TR css3-transitions  transition-duration  Indicates the length of time to apply the transition; a default value  of 0 configures an immediate transition; otherwise, use a numeric  value to specify time  usually in seconds   transition-timing-function  Configures changes in the speed of the transition by describing  how intermediate property values are calculated; common  values include ease  default , linear , ease-in , ease-out ,  ease-in-out  transition-delay   Indicates the beginning of the transition; a default value of 0  configures no delay; otherwise, use a numeric value to specify time   usually in seconds   transition  Shorthand property; list the value for transition-property ,  transition-duration , transition-timing-function ,  and transition-delay separated by spaces; default  values can be omitted, but the first unit of time applies to  transition-duration  11.7 CSS3 and Interactivity  463  Browser vendor prefixes are needed to configure transitions. Transitions are  supported by current versions of most modern browsers. However, transitions are  not currently supported by Internet Explorer. Code four style declarations to configure  a transition:  ● -webkit-transition  for Webkit browsers   ● -moz-transition  for Gecko browsers   ● -o-transition  for the Opera browser   ● transition  W3C draft syntax   The web page in Figure 11.19  see chapter11 gallery transition.html in the student  files  demonstrates the use of the CSS3 transition property to straighten the  lighthouse photo when the web page visitor hovers over it with the mouse. Compare  the position of the lighthouse photo in Figures 11.18 and 11.19 to see the result of the  transition.  Figure 11.19 The interactive CSS3 transition effect   Configuring a CSS3 Transition  The transition was applied to the transform property and uses the shorthand  transition property to configure a rotation back to 0 degrees in 1 2 second with  smooth, linear timing. The key is to configure a style rule for the .figure:hover  pseudo-class with a style declaration with the ending value of the transform property  464  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  in addition to style declarations for the transition property. The new CSS code has a  lot of repetition because of the browser vendor prefixes on the CSS3 properties:  .figure:hover { -webkit-transform: rotate 0deg ;  -moz-transform: rotate 0deg ;  -o-transform: rotate 0deg ;  transform: rotate 0deg ;  -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform .5s linear;  -moz-transition: -moz-transform .5s linear;  -o-transition: -o-transform .5s linear;  transition: transform .5s linear; }  As shown in the previous code, the syntax for configuring transforms varies by browser en-  gine. It is expected that eventually all browsers will support W3C transition syntax, so code  this declaration last in the list. Recall that the browser proprietary CSS syntax in this section  is nonstandard. Your CSS code will not pass W3C validation when you use these properties.  Hands-On Practice 11.9  In this Hands-On Practice, you will modify the web page shown in Figure 11.19 to also change  the background color of the .fi gure class from white to light gray when a web page visitor  hovers the mouse over the lighthouse photo. Create a folder named transition and copy the  lighthouseisland.jpg  and  lighthouselogo.jpg  fi  les  from  the  chapter11 starters  folder  in  the student  fi les. Launch a text editor and open transition.html, which is located in the chapter11 transform  folder  in  the  student  fi  les.  Display  the  page  in  a  browser  and  mouse  over  the lighthouseisland.jpg  image. If your browser supports transitions, your display should be similar to Figure 11.19 .  Edit the embedded CSS in the file and modify the .figure:hover selector to change the  background color to cccccc over a period of 1 second with ease-in timing. Notice how you can  configure transitions for more than one property by separating them with a comma.  .figure:hover { background-color: cccccc;  -webkit-transform:  rotate 0deg ;  -moz-transform:  rotate 0deg ;  -o-transform:  rotate 0deg ;  transform:   rotate 0deg ;  -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform .5s linear,  background-color 1s ease-in;  -moz-transition: -moz-transform .5s linear,  background-color 1s ease-in;  -o-transition: -o-transform .5s linear,  background-color 1s ease-in;  transition: transform .5s linear,  background-color 1s ease-in; }  Save  your  file  as  index.html  in  your  transition  folder  and  test  it  in  a  browser  that  supports transi-  tions. When you hover over the lighthouse photo, you still should see it rotate and you also  should  see  the  background  color  of  the  photo  area  change.  A  solution  is  available  in  the student  files  chapter11 transform transition2.html .  11.8 Java  465  ● CSS Transitions 101:  See the following resources for more examples of CSS transforms and transitions:  http:  www.webdesignerdepot.com 2010 01 css-transitions-101  ● Using CSS Transforms and Transitions:  http:  return-true.com 2010 06 using-css-transforms-and-transitions  ● CSS Fundamentals: CSS3 Transitions: http:  net.tutsplus.com tutorials   html-css-techniques css-fundametals-css-3-transitions  11.8  Java  Java is an object-oriented programming  OOP  language developed  by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle. An  object-oriented program consists of a group of cooperating objects  that exchange messages for the purpose of achieving a common  objective. Java is not the same language as JavaScript. It is more  powerful and much more flexible than JavaScript. Java can be used   to develop both stand-alone executable applications and applets  that are invoked by web pages.  Java applets are platform independent, which means that they can  be written and run on any platform: Mac, UNIX, Linux, and Windows.  Java applets are compiled  translated from the English-like Java  statements to an encoded form  and saved as .class files, which  contain byte code. The byte code is interpreted by the Java Virtual  Machine  JVM  in the web browser. The JVM interprets the byte code  into the proper machine language for the operating system. The ap-  plet is then executed and appears on the web page. See Figure 11.20  for a diagram that shows this process. When a Java applet loads,  Figure 11.20 The Java Virtual Machine  the area reserved for it on the web page displays an empty rectan-  interprets the byte code into machine  language  gular area until the applet begins to execute.  Java applets can process interactive navigation bars on web pages. Visit Java  Boutique   http:  javaboutique.internet.com navigation menu.html   and Apycom    http:  apycom.com   for a variety of navigation and menu Java applets. Online games  are a popular use of Java applets; try some classic Java applet games at Java on the  Brain     http:  www.javaonthebrain.com brain.html  .  Java  applets  can  also  be  used  to  create image and text effects, such as the sample applet shown in Figure 11.21  see  chapter11 java1.html in the student files . While text effects and games are fun, the use  of Java applets in business applications has been increasing for functions such as finan-  cial calculations and visualization. JARS   http:  www.jars.com   provides a Java applet  review service and describes applets that are useful in a business environment, such as  NetCharts  from  Visual  Mining     http:  www.visualmining.com  .  This  type  of  applet  often connects to databases on a web server and can be a very powerful tool if you need to  display live data visually. Java applets can perform a variety of functions on web pages.  As a web developer, your usual role will not be that of a Java software developer—that  is, you should not be expected to write Java applets. However, you could be asked to  work with a Java developer to place his or her applet on your website. Whether you ob-  tain an applet from a coworker or find one on a free site, you need to code HTML to dis-  play the applet.   466  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Figure 11.21 A Java applet that provides changing text  Adding a Java Applet to a Web Page  A while back, the now-obsolete applet element was typically used along with the param ele-  ment to configure a Java applet on a web page. The W3C recommends using the multipur-  pose object element to configure a Java applet on a web page. The   tag specifies  the beginning of an applet area in the body of a web page. Its closing tag,   ,  specifies the ending of an applet area in the body of a web page. The object element has a  number of attributes that are used with Java applets, as described in Table 11.11 .  Table 11.11 Object element attributes used with Java applets  Specifies the MIME type of the Java applet: application x-java-applet  Specifies the height of the applet area in pixels  Specifies the width of the applet area in pixels  Optional; brief text description that may be displayed by browsers or assistive  The software developer who creates an applet determines the parameter values and  names required by a specific Java applet. Therefore, expect each applet to require differ-  ent parameters. Other parameter names and expected values will be provided in the ap-  plet documentation. The parameters will be different, depending on the function of the  applet. One parameter might be used to set a background color; another parameter  could be used to contain a person’s name. Parameters are configured with the param el-  ement. The code parameter indicates the name of the Java applet.  Hands-On Practice 11.10  In this Hands-On Practice, you will launch a text editor and create a web page that contains a  Java applet. This example will use the fader26 applet  provided by Johannes Schellen . This  applet displays text messages one at a time. The list of text messages is obtained from a text fi le   .txt fi le extension  that you will create. An example of this applet at work can be found in the  student fi les  chapter11 java1.html .

Do not change the name  Whether you obtain an applet from a free website or from a coworker, each applet should have  some accompanying documentation that indicates what parameter it expects. Documentation  for the fader26 applet appears in Table 11.12 .

Save the file in the testapplet folder with the file name java.html. You are not yet ready to test the  page because you need to create and format the text file that the applet expects. This applet expects  each  line  of  text  to  begin  with  text=  .  Figure  11.22  shows  a  sample  text  file  created  using Notepad.  Use this as a guide to create your text file. Save your text file as message.txt in the testapplet   folder. The name of the text file must match the value of the Data parameter in the HTML code.  Now launch your web page in a browser. The applet  should display your text one line at a time  your  browser may display a warning message about the  fader26.class applet being created using an earlier ver-  sion of Java—just click OK or Continue . Be aware that  the disadvantage of using Java applets is the lag be-  tween the time that the web page is initially loaded and  the time that the applet actually begins to execute.

If your applet does not function as expected, verify the following:  ● Are Java applets enabled in your browser?  ● Is the applet saved in the testapplet folder?  ● Is the applet saved with the name fader26.class  all letters must be lowercase ?  ● Are the java.html and message.txt files saved in the testapplet folder?  Java Applet Resources  few helpful sites:  There are many resources for free and commercial Java applets on the Web. Here are a  ● Java on the Brain: http:  www.javaonthebrain.com  ● Java Applet Archive: http:  www.echoecho.com freeapplets.htm  As you visit these and other Java resource sites, keep in mind that some Java applets  are copyrighted. Be sure to obtain permission from the creator of the applet before  using it on your site. There may be some requirements for giving credit to the creator  Focus on   either by name or by linking to their website. Follow the instructions provided with the  applet. Some applets are free for use on personal websites, but require licenses for  Ethics  commercial use.  FAQ Can you share an example of using the obsolete applet element?  Sure! Although the applet element is obsolete, you’ll probably run across web pages that still  use it. An example of using the applet element to display a Java applet is  <applet code="fader26.class" width="610" height="30"  alt="Displays a message that describes uses of Java applets.">           Java Applets can be used to display text, manipulate graphics,   Oracle   play games, and more.

Describe a disadvantage of using Java applets on web pages.  11.9 JavaScript  469  11.9  JavaScript  JavaScript is an object-based scripting language. In JavaScript, you work with the objects  associated with a web page document: the window, the document, and elements such as  forms, images, and links. JavaScript, developed by Netscape, was originally called  LiveScript. When Netscape collaborated with Sun Microsystems on modifications to the  language, it was renamed JavaScript. JavaScript is not the same as the Java programming   language. Unlike Java, JavaScript cannot be used to write stand-alone programs that can  run outside of a web browser. JavaScript statements can be placed in a separate file   with a .js extension  that is accessed by a web browser; however, JavaScript statements  are often embedded directly on the web page along with the HTML. In either case, the web  browser interprets the JavaScript statements. JavaScript is considered to be a client-side  scripting language because it runs on the client side  the browser , not the web server.  Note that although some web servers  such as the Sun Java System Web Server  can process  server-side JavaScript, the language is most commonly used for client-side scripting.  FAQ Don’t all browsers support JavaScript?  Most modern browsers support JavaScript. However, they also offer the option to disable  JavaScript. Some assistive technologies, such as screen readers, may not support JavaScript.  You can’t assume that every person who visits your website allows JavaScript. It’s a good idea  to offer your web page visitors an alternative  plain-text links, a phone number to call, and so  on  if the features on your website are dependent upon JavaScript.  JavaScript is often used to respond to events such as moving the mouse, clicking a button,  and loading a web page. This technology is also often used to edit and verify information on  HTML form controls such as text boxes, check boxes, and radio buttons. JavaScript can be  used to create pop-up windows, display the current date, perform calculations, and so on.  Figure 11.23 shows a website that uses JavaScript to determine and display the current date.  Figure 11.23 This web page displays the current date with JavaScript  470  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Figure 11.24 The Document Object Model  DOM   There is an introduction to coding JavaScript in Chapter 14 . An important part of working  with JavaScript is manipulating the Document Object Model  DOM . The DOM defines  every object and element on a web page. Its hierarchical structure can be used to ac-  cess page elements and apply styles to page elements. A portion of a basic DOM that is  common to most browsers is shown in Figure 11.24 .  JavaScript Resources  There is a lot to learn about JavaScript, but there are many free resources for JavaScript   code and JavaScript tutorials on the Web. Here are a few sites that offer free tutorials or  free scripts:  ● JavaScript Tutorial: http:  echoecho.com javascript.htm  ● JavaScript for the Total Non-Programmer: http:  www.webteacher.com javascript  ● JavaScript Tutorial: http:  www.w3schools.com JS  Once you are comfortable with HTML and CSS, the JavaScript language is a good tech-  nology to learn as you continue your studies. Try some of the resources listed and get  your feet wet. See Chapter 14 for a more detailed introduction to JavaScript. The next  section introduces Ajax, a technology that uses JavaScript.  11.10  Ajax  Ajax is not a single technology, but a combination of different technologies. Ajax  stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. These technologies are not new, but  recently have been used together to provide a better experience for web visitors  and create interactive web applications. Jesse James Garrett of Adaptive Path    http:  adaptivepath.com ideas ajax-new-approach-web-applications   is credited with coining the term “Ajax”. The technologies utilized in Ajax are as follows:  11.10 Ajax  471  ● Standards-based HTML and CSS  ● The Document Object Model  ● XML  and the related XSLT technology   ● Asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest  ● JavaScript  Some of these technologies may be unfamiliar to you. That’s okay at this point in your web  development career. You’re currently creating a strong foundation in HTML and CSS and may  decide to continue your studies in the future and learn additional web technologies. Right  now, it’s enough to know that these technologies exist and what they can be used for.  Ajax is part of the Web 2.0 movement—the transition of the Web from isolated  static websites to a platform that uses technology to provide rich interfaces and  social networking opportunities for people. See “What Is Web 2.0?”    http:  www.oreillynet.com pub a oreilly tim news 2005 09 30 what-is-Web-20.html    by Tim O’Reilly, who was instrumental in the creation of the term “Web 2.0”.  Ajax is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications. Recall the  client server model discussed in Chapters 1 and 9 . The browser makes a request to the  server  often triggered by clicking a link or a submit button , and   server  often triggered by clicking a link or a submit button , and  the server returns an entire new web page for the browser to dis-  play. Ajax pushes more of the processing on the client  browser   using JavaScript and XML and often uses behind-the-scenes asyn-  chronous requests to the server to refresh a portion of the browser  display instead of the entire web page. The key is that when using  Ajax technology, JavaScript code  which runs on the client compu-  ter within the confines of the browser  can communicate directly  with the server, exchanging data and modifying parts of the web  page display without reloading the entire web page. For example,  as soon as a website visitor types a zip code into a form, the value  could be looked up in a zip code database and the city state au-  tomatically populated using Ajax—and all of this takes place while  the visitor is entering the form information before they click the  Figure 11.25 Ajax technologies are used to  submit button. The result is that the visitor perceives the web  update the page as the visitor types  page as being more responsive and has a more interactive experi-  ence. See CSS Property Review   http:  webdevfoundations.net css   for an example of Ajax in action. As shown in Figure 11.19 , hints are provided as you type the name of a CSS  property without refreshing the page.  Developers are using Ajax to support the web applications that are part of Web 2.0:  Flickr photo sharing   http:  www.flickr.com  , the Delicious shared collection of favorite  sites   http:  www.delicious.com  , Google e-mail   http:  gmail.google.com  , the Amazon  A9 search engine   http:  www.a9.com  , and Microsoft Live   http:  www.live.com  .  Ajax Resources  Ajax is a very hot topic on the Web right now and there are many resources and articles  available. Some helpful sites are listed here:  ● Getting Started with Ajax: http:  www.alistapart.com articles gettingstartedwithajax  ● Ajax Tutorial: http:  www.tizag.com ajaxTutorial  Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  472  11.11  HTML5 Canvas Element  The HTML5 canvas element configures dynamic graphics. It provides a way to dynami-   cally draw and transform lines, shapes, images, and text on web pages. If that wasn’t  enough, the canvas element also provides methods to interact with actions taken by the  user, like moving the mouse.  The canvas element begins with the   tag and  ends with the   tag. However, the canvas ele-  ment is configured through an application programming  interface  API , which means that a programming or  scripting language, such as JavaScript, is needed to  implement it. The canvas API provides methods for  two-dimensional  2D  bitmap drawing, including lines,  strokes, arcs, fills, gradients, images, and text.  However, instead of drawing visually using a graphics  application, you draw programmatically by writing  JavaScript statements. A very basic example of using  JavaScript to draw within the canvas element is shown  in Figure 11.26  see chapter11 canvas.html in the stu-  var canvas = document.getElementById "myCanvas" ;  dent files . The code is  Figure 11.26 The canvas element            Canvas Element            canvas { border: 2px solid red; }     function drawMe   {  if  canvas.getContext  {  var ctx = canvas.getContext "2d" ;  ctx.fi llStyle = "rgb 255, 0, 0 ";  ctx.font = "bold 3em Georgia";  ctx.fi llText "My Canvas", 70, 100 ;  ctx.fi llStyle = "rgba 0, 0, 200, 0.50 ";  ctx.fi llRect 57, 54, 100, 65 ;  }  }                  The Canvas Element        11.11 HTML5 Canvas Element  473  If some of the code looks like a foreign language to you, don’t worry: JavaScript IS a  different language than CSS and HTML; it has its own syntax and rules. Here’s a quick  overview of the code:  ● The red outline was created by applying CSS to the canvas selector.  ● The JavaScript function drawMe   is invoked when the browser loads the  page. JavaScript looks for a canvas element assigned to the “myCanvas” id.  JavaScript tests for browser support of canvas and, if true, performs the  following actions:  ● Sets the canvas context to 2D.  ● Draws the “My Canvas” text.  ● Uses the fi llStyle attribute to set the drawing color to red.  ● Uses the font attribute to confi gure font weight, font size, and font family.  ● Uses the fi llText method to specify the text to display, followed by the x-value   pixels in from the left  and y-value  pixels down from the top .  ● Draws the rectangle.  ● Uses the fi llStyle attribute to set the drawing color to blue with 50% opacity.  ● Uses the fi llRect method to set the x-value  pixels in from the left , y-value   pixels down from the top , width, and height of the rectangle.  The promise of the canvas element is that it can be used to provide interactions as  sophisticated as those developed with Adobe Flash. At the time this was written, all  modern browsers  with the exception of Internet Explorer  support the canvas element.  Use a browser other than Internet Explorer to see virtuoso examples of the canvas  element in action at the following websites:  ● Implementing a HTML5 Canvas-based, Tilt Sensing Snow Globe:  http:  blog.webreakstuff.com 2010 11 building-a-canvas-snowglobe  ● Canvas Demos: Applications, games, tools, and tutorials for the HTML5 canvas  element: http:  www.canvasdemos.com  This section provided a very quick overview of the canvas element.

Chapter 11 Web Multimedia and Interactivity  Accessibility and Multimedia Interactivity  Multimedia and interactivity can help to create a compelling, engaging experience for  your website visitors. Please keep in mind that not every web visitor will be able to  experience these features, so incorporate the following into your website:  474  11.12  Focus on  Accessibility  ● Provide links to free downloads for the plug-ins used by your multimedia.  ● Text descriptions and equivalent content  such as captions  of audio and video  will provide access for those with hearing challenges and will also assist visitors  using mobile devices or slow Internet connections.  ● When you work with multimedia developers and programmers to create Flash  animation or Java applets for your site, request features that provide accessibility,  such as keyboard access, text descriptions, and so on. If you use Flash or a Java  applet for site navigation, be sure that it can be accessed with a keyboard and or  provide plain-text navigation links in the footer section of the pages. Adobe  provides good resources for web developers on their Accessibility web page    http:  www.adobe.com resources accessibility  .  ● WCAG 2.0 Guideline 2.3.1 recommends that a web page not contain any item that  flashes more than three times per second. This is to prevent optically induced  seizures. You may need to work with your multimedia developer to ensure that  dynamic effects perform within a safe range.  ● If you use JavaScript, be aware that some visitors may have JavaScript disabled  or are unable to manipulate the mouse. In order to be in compliance with Section  508 of the Rehabilitation Act, your site must be functional at a basic level, even if  your visitor’s browser does not support JavaScript. A site using Ajax to redisplay  a portion of the browser window may have issues when accessed using an assis-  tive technology or text browser. The importance of testing cannot be overempha-  sized. W3C has developed ARIA  Accessible Rich Internet Applications , which is  a protocol that supports accessibility for scripted and dynamic content, such as  the web applications created using Ajax. At the time this was written, ARIA was  not uniformly supported by all commonly used browsers. See WAI-ARIA Overview    http:  www.w3.org WAI intro aria.php   for more information about ARIA.  When you design with multimedia interactivity accessibility in mind, you help those  visitors who have physical challenges, as well as those who are using low bandwidth or  who may be missing plug-ins on their browser. As a last resort, consider creating a sep-  arate text-only version of the page if the multimedia and or interactivity used on a page  cannot comply with accessibility guidelines.  Chapter Summary   This  chapter  introduced  technologies  to  add  media  and  interactivity  to  web  pages.  HTML techniques used to  confi gure sound and video were discussed. Adobe Flash, Java applets, JavaScript, Ajax, and the HTML5  canvas  element  were  introduced.  You  confi  gured  an  interactive  CSS  image  gallery  and explored the new  CSS3 transition and transform properties.

Whether business-to-business, business-to-consumer, or consumer-  to-consumer, websites that support e-commerce are everywhere. This chapter  provides an overview of this topic.  487  488  12.1  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  What Is E-Commerce?  VideoNote  E-Commerce Benefi ts  & Risks  financial transactions on the Internet.  Advantages of E-Commerce  A formal definition of e-commerce is the integration of communications, data manage-  ment, and security technologies, which allows individuals and organizations to ex-  change information related to the sale of goods and services. The major functions of  e-commerce include the buying of goods, the selling of goods, and the performance of  There are a number of advantages for both businesses and consumers when engaging   in e-commerce. For businesses, the many advantages include the following:  ● Reduced Costs. Online businesses can stay open 24 hours a day without the  overhead of a brick-and-mortar facility. Many businesses establish a website  before attempting e-commerce. When they add e-commerce functions to their  website, the site becomes a source of revenue and, in many cases, pays for itself  in short order.  ● Increased Customer Satisfaction. Businesses can use their websites to improve  communication with customers and increase customer satisfaction. E-commerce  sites often contain a page for frequently asked questions  FAQs . The availability  of customer service representatives by e-mail, discussion forums, or even online  chats  see LivePerson at http:  www.liveperson.com   can improve customer  relations.  ● More Effective Data Management. Depending on the level of automation,  e-commerce sites can perform credit card verification and authorization, update  inventory levels, and interface with order fulfillment systems, thereby managing  the organization’s data more efficiently.  ● Potentially Higher Sales. An e-commerce store that is open 24 hours a day,  7 days a week and is available to everyone on the planet has the potential for  higher sales than a traditional brick-and-mortar storefront.  Businesses aren’t the only beneficiaries of e-commerce; consumers see some  advantages as well, including the following:  ● Convenience. Consumers can shop at any time of the day. There is no travel time  to get to the store. Some consumers prefer website shopping over traditional  catalog shopping because they can view additional images and join discussion  forums about the products.  ● Easier Comparison Shopping. There is no driving from store to store to check  the price of an item. Customers can easily surf the Web to compare prices and  value.  ● Wider Selection of Goods. Because it is convenient to shop and compare,  consumers have a wider selection of goods available for purchase.  As you can see, e-commerce provides a number of advantages for both businesses and  consumers.  12.1 What Is E-Commerce?  489  Risks of E-Commerce  There are risks involved in any business transaction and e-commerce is no exception.  The possible risks for businesses include the following:  ● Loss of Sales if Technology Fails. If your website isn’t available or your  e-commerce form processing doesn’t work, customers may not return to your  site. It is always important to have a user-friendly, reliable website, but when you  engage in e-commerce, reliability and ease of use are critical factors in the  success of your business.  ● Fraudulent Transactions. Fraudulent credit card purchases or crank orders placed  by vandals  or 13-year-olds with time on their hands  are risks that businesses  need to deal with.   ● Customer Reluctance. Although more and more consumers are willing to  purchase on the Web, the target market of your business may not be. However,  by offering incentives such as free shipping or a “no questions asked” returns  policy, your business may be able to attract these consumers.  ● Increased Competition. Because the overhead for an e-commerce site can  be much lower than that of a traditional brick-and-mortar store, a company  operating out of a basement can be just as impressive as a long-standing  business if its website looks professional. Because it is much easier to enter  the marketplace with an e-commerce store, your business will have increased  competition.  Businesses are not alone in needing to deal with the risks associated with e-commerce.  Consumers may perceive the following risks:  ● Security Issues. Later in this chapter, you will learn how to determine whether  a website uses a Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  protocol for the encryption and  security of information. The general public may not know how to determine  whether a website is using this encryption method and be wary of placing a  credit card order. Another, possibly more important, issue is what the site  does with information after it is transmitted over the Internet. Is the database  secure? Are the database backups secure? These questions are difficult to  answer. It’s a good idea to purchase only from sites that you consider to be  reputable.  ● Privacy Issues. Many sites post privacy policy statements. These describe what  the site will do  or will not do  with the information they receive. Some sites  use the data for internal marketing purposes only. Other sites sell the data to  outside companies. Websites can and do change their privacy policies over  time. Consumers may be leery of purchasing online because of the potential  lack of privacy.  ● Purchasing Based on Photos and Descriptions. There is nothing like holding and  touching an item before you purchase it. Consumers run the risk of purchasing  a product that they will not be happy with because they are making purchasing  decisions based on photographs and written descriptions. If an e-commerce site  490  12.2  a purchase.  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  has a generous returns policy, consumers will feel more confident about making  ● Returns. It is often more difficult to return an item to an e-commerce store than to  a brick-and-mortar store. Consumers may not want to risk this inconvenience.  E-Commerce Business Models  Both businesses and consumers are riding the e-commerce wave. There are four  common e-commerce business models: business-to-consumer, business-to-business,  consumer-to-consumer, and business-to-government.  ● Business-to-Consumer  B2C . Most of the business-to-consumer selling takes  place at online stores. Some, like Amazon.com   http:  www.amazon.com  , are   online only. Others are click-and-mortar—electronic storefronts for well-known  brick-and-mortar stores such as Sears   http:  www.sears.com  .  ● Business-to-Business  B2B . E-commerce between two businesses often takes  the form of exchanging business supply chain information among vendors,  partners, and business customers. Electronic Data Interchange  EDI  is also  included in this category.  ● Consumer-to-Consumer  C2C . Individuals are selling to each other on the  Internet. The most common format is that of the auction. The most well-known  auction site is eBay   http:  www.ebay.com  , which was founded in 1995.  ● Business-to-Government  B2G . Businesses are selling to the government on the  Internet. There are very strict usability standards for businesses that target gov-  ernmental agencies. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that electronic  and information technology  including web pages  used by federal agencies is  accessible to people with disabilities. See http:  www.section508.gov for more  Businesses began exchanging information electronically using EDI many years before  information.  the Web came into existence.  12.3  Electronic Data Interchange  EDI   Electronic Data Interchange is the transfer of structured data between companies over  a network. This facilitates the exchange of standard business documents, including  purchase orders and invoices. EDI is not new; it has been in existence since the 1960s.  Organizations that exchange EDI transmissions are called trading partners.  The Accredited Standards Committee X12  ASC X12  is chartered by the American  National Standards Institute  ANSI  to develop and maintain EDI standards. These  standards include transaction sets for common business forms, such as requisitions  and invoices. This allows businesses to reduce paperwork and communicate  EDI messages are placed in transaction sets, which consist of a header; one or more  data segments, which are strings of data elements separated by delimiters; and a  electronically.  12.4 E-Commerce Statistics  491  trailer. Newer technologies such as XML and web services are allowing trading  partners virtually unlimited opportunities to customize their information exchange  over the Internet.  Now that you are aware of the possibilities of e-commerce and the types of business  models, you may be wondering where the most money is being made. The next section  discusses some statistics related to e-commerce.  12.4  E-Commerce Statistics  You may be surprised to discover that the most money is being made in B2B  e-commerce—businesses selling to other businesses. According to the U.S. Census  Bureau, in 2009, B2B transactions accounted for 91% of e-commerce in the United  States. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that online retail sales increased from  $34 billion in 2002 to $165 billion in 2010.   Although e-commerce growth stalled during the recent economic  downturn, it is again demonstrating growth. eMarketer     http:  www.emarketer.com Report.aspx?code=emarketer_2000770      reported  that  while  e- commerce only grew 1.6% in 2009, more than 14% growth was demonstrated in  2010. The research firm forecasts more than 13% growth in e-commerce in 2011 and  cites mobile commerce, social commerce, and daily deal sites such as Groupon    http:  www.groupon.com   as contributing to growth. According to a TechCrunch report    http:  tinyurl.com 3m7vwku  , Forrester Research predicts online retail sales growth at  a 10% compound annual rate, reaching more than $248 billion by 2014.  You may be wondering what people are buying online. A report compiled by the U.S.  Census Bureau   http:  www.census.gov compendia statab 2011 tables 11s1055.xls    indicated that the top 10 categories for online retail sales in 2008  the most recent year  with actual sales figures  were the following:  1. Clothing, accessories, and footwear  $17 billion   2. Computer hardware and software  $14.3 billion   3. Electronics and appliances  $13 billion   4. Furniture and home furnishings  $9.8 billion   5. Books, music, and videos  $9 billion   6. Office equipment and supplies  $5.8 billion   7. Drugs, health aids, and beauty aids  $5.5 billion   8. Sporting goods  $3.9 billion   9. Toys, hobby goods, and games  $3.3 billion   10. Food, beer, and wine  $2.3 billion   Now that you know what is selling the best online, who are your potential online  consumers? eMarketer forecasts that in 2011, close to 179 million Americans ages 14  and older will shop online. A survey by the PEW Internet and American Life Project    http:  www.pewinternet.org Static-Pages Trend-Data Whos-Online.aspx   indicated that while about the same percentage of men and women are online, Internet usage  varies by age, income, and education. Table 12.1 shows an excerpt from this research.  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  Table 12.1 Online population  Percentage Who Use the Internet  492  Category  Men  78%  Women  76%  Age: 18–29  Age: 30–49  Age: 50–64  90%  84%  76%  46%  Age: 65 and older   Household Income: Less than $30,000  Household Income: $30,000 to $49,999  Household Income: $50,000 to $74,999  Household Income: $75,000 or higher  Education: Did not graduate high school  Education: High school graduate  Education: Some college  Education: College graduate  63%  79%  92%  96%  40%  69%  89%  93%  12.5  E-Commerce Issues  common issues:  Doing business on the Internet is not without its problems. The following are some  ● Intellectual Property. There has been some recent controversy regarding intel-  lectual property rights and domain names. Cybersquatting is the practice of  registering a domain name that is a trademark of another entity in the hopes  of profiting by selling the domain name to the entity. The Internet Corporation  for Assigned Names and Numbers  ICANN  sponsors the Uniform Domain Name  Dispute  Policy  at  http:  www.icann.org udrp udrp.htm ,  which  can  be  used  to  combat cybersquatters.  ● Security. Security is a constant issue on the Internet. Distributed denial of serv-  ice  DDoS  attacks have shut down popular e-commerce sites. Some of these  attacks are carried out by script kiddies  teenagers with technical knowledge and  sometimes malicious intent , who literally have nothing better to do than cause  ● Fraud. Fraudulent websites that ask for credit card numbers without any intent  of delivering products or with fraudulent intent are an understandable source of  havoc on the Web.  concern for consumers.  ● Taxation. State governments and local municipalities need sales tax to fund  education, public safety, health, and many other essential services. When an  item is purchased at a retail store, the sales tax is collected from the purchaser  by the seller at the time of the sale and periodically remitted by the seller to the  state in which the sale occurred.  When an item is purchased on the Internet, the seller usually does not collect  and remit the sales tax. In this situation, many states require that consumers  12.6 E-Commerce Security  493  file a use tax and pay the amount that would have been collected. In reality, few   consumers do this and few states attempt to enforce it. Our local governments  are losing revenue for funding worthwhile programs.  There have been some movements to require that sales tax is collected on all  Internet purchases. At the time this was written, the moratorium on Internet  sales tax was still in effect. However, state and local governments are losing  sources of revenue as more consumers turn to online shopping. Look for the  topic of Internet sales tax to continue to be controversial.  ● International Commerce. Websites that target a global audience have  additional concerns. If a site will be offered in multiple languages, there  are options of automatic translation programs such as SYSTRANLinks    http:  www.systranlinks.com   and companies that provide customized  website translation services such as WorldLingo   http:  www.worldlingo.com  .  Be aware that the graphical user interface  GUI  that works with English may  not work with other languages. For example, comparable words and phrases  often take quite a few more letters in German than in English. If your GUI has  minimal white space in the English version of the site, how will it look in the  German version?  How will your international customers pay you? If you accept credit cards, the  credit card company will perform the currency conversion. What about the culture  of your target international audience? Have you studied the target countries and  made certain that your site is appealing and not offensive? Another issue related  to international commerce is the cost of shipping and the availability of delivery  Now that you are familiar with the concept of e-commerce, let’s take a closer look at  encryption methods and security. The next section introduces encryption methods, SSL,  to remote destinations.  and digital certificates.  12.6  E-Commerce Security  Encryption  Encryption is used to ensure privacy within an organization and on the Internet.  Encryption is the conversion of data into an unreadable form, called a ciphertext .  Ciphertext cannot be easily understood by unauthorized individuals. Decryption is the  process of converting the ciphertext into its original form, called plain text or clear text ,  so that it can be understood. The process of encryption and decryption requires an algo-  rithm and a key. An algorithm involves a mathematical calculation. A key is a numeric  code that should be long enough so that its value cannot easily be guessed.  Encryption is important on the Internet because information in a packet can be  intercepted as it travels the communications media. If a hacker or business competitor  intercepts an encrypted packet, he or she will not be able to use the information  such  as a credit card number or business strategy  because it cannot be read.  A number of types of encryption are commonly used on the Internet, including  symmetric-key encryption and asymmetric-key encryption .   494  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  Figure 12.1 Symmetric-key encryption uses a single key  Figure 12.2 Asymmetric-key encryption uses a key pair  Symmetric-Key Encryption  Symmetric-key encryption, shown in Figure 12.1 , is also called single-key encryption  because both the encryption and decryption use the same key. Because the key must be  kept secret from others, both the sender and the receiver must know the key before  communicating using encryption. An advantage of symmetric-key encryption is speed.  Asymmetric-Key Encryption  Asymmetric-key encryption is also called public-key encryption because there is no  shared secret. Instead, two keys are created at the same time. This key pair contains a  public key and a private key. The public key and the private key are mathematically re-  lated in such a way that it is unlikely that anyone would guess one of the pair even with  knowledge of the other. Only the public key can decrypt a message encrypted with the  private key and only the private key can decrypt a message encrypted with the public  key  see Figure 12.2  . The public key is available via a digital certificate  more on that  later . The private key should be kept secure and secret. It is stored on the web server   or other computer  of the key owner. Asymmetric-key encryption is much slower than  symmetric-key encryption.  Integrity  The encryption methods described above help to keep the contents of a message se-  cret. However, e-commerce security is also concerned with making sure that messages  have not been altered or damaged during transmission. A message is said to have  integrity if it can be proven that is has not been altered. Hash functions provide a way  to ensure the integrity of messages. A hash function, or hash algorithm, transforms a   string of characters into a usually shorter, fixed-length value or key, called a digest ,  which represents the original string.  These security methods—especially the techniques of symmetric-key and asymmetric-  key encryption—are used as part of SSL, the technology that helps to make commerce  on the Internet secure. The next section introduces this technology.  12.6 E-Commerce Security  495  Secure Sockets Layer  SSL   Secure Sockets Layer is a protocol that allows data to be privately exchanged over  public networks. It was developed by Netscape and is used to encrypt data sent  between a client  usually a web browser  and a web server. SSL utilizes both symmetric  SSL provides secure communication between a client and a server by using  and asymmetric keys.  the following:  for authentication  ● Server and  optionally  client digital certificates  ● Symmetric-key cryptography with a “session  key” for bulk encryption  ● Public-key cryptography for transfer of the  session key  ● Message digests  hash functions  to verify the  integrity of the transmission  You can tell that a website is using SSL by the protocol  in the web browser address text box—it shows https  instead of http. Also, browsers typically display a lock  Figure 12.3 The Google Chrome browser indicates that  icon or other indicator of SSL, as shown in Figure 12.3 .  SSL is being used  FAQ When some websites are displayed in a browser, there is a color bar in  the address area. What’s up?  If a website displays a color bar in the address area of the browser in addition to the lock icon  in  the  status  bar,  you  know  that  it  is  using Extended  Validation  SSL   EV  SSL   .  EV  SSL   signifies  that the business has undergone more rigorous background checks to obtain its digital  certificate, including verification of the following:    The applicant owns the domain.    The applicant works for the organization.    The applicant has the authority to update the website.    The organization is a valid, recognized place of business.  Digital Certificate  SSL enables two computers to communicate securely by posting a digital certificate for  authentication. A digital certificate is a form of an asymmetric key that also contains in-  formation about the certificate, the holder of the certificate, and the issuer of the certifi-  cate. The contents of a digital certificate include the following:  ● The public key  ● The effective date of the certificate  ● Details about the certificate authority  the issuer of the certificate   496  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  ● The expiration date of the certificate  ● Details about the certificate holder  ● A digest of the certificate content  certificate authorities.  VeriSign   http:  www.verisign.com   and Entrust  http:  www.entrust.net  are well-known  To obtain a certificate, you request a certificate from a certificate authority and pay the  application fee. The certificate authority verifies your identity, issues your certificate,  and supplies you with a public private key pair. You store the certificate in your soft-  ware, such as a web server, web browser, or e-mail application. The certificate authority  makes your certificate publicly known.  FAQ Do I have to apply for a certificate?  If you are accepting any personal information on your website such as credit card numbers,  you should be using SSL. One option is to visit a certificate authority  such as VeriSign or  Thawte at http:  www.thawte.com   and apply for your own certificate. There may be a waiting  period and you will need to pay an annual fee.  As an alternative, your web host provider may let you piggyback on its certificate. Normally,  there is a setup and or monthly fee for this service. Usually, the web host assigns you a folder  on its secure server. You place the web pages  and associated files such as images  that need  to be securely processed in the folder. When linking to the web pages, you use “https” instead  of “http” on your absolute links. Contact your web host provider for details.  SSL and Digital Certificates  A number of steps are involved in the SSL authentication process. The web browser and  web server go through initial handshaking steps, exchanging information about the server  certificate and keys. Once trust is established, the web browser encrypts the single secret   key  symmetric key  that will be used for the rest of the communication. From this point  on, all data is encrypted through the secret key. Table 12.2 shows this process.

The server’s private key is used to encrypt a message. Only the  public key can decrypt this message.  The browser now verifies the identity of the web server.

What are three advantages of e-commerce for an entrepreneur who is just starting  2. What are three risks that businesses face when engaging in e-commerce?  3. Define SSL. How can an online shopper tell that an e-commerce site is using SSL.  12.7  Order and Payment Processing   In B2C e-commerce, the products for sale are displayed in an online catalog. On large  sites, these catalog pages are dynamically created using server-side scripts to access  databases. Each item usually has a button or image that invites visitors to “Buy Me” or  “Add to Cart”. Items selected are placed in a virtual shopping cart. When visitors are  finished shopping, they click a button or image link which indicates that they want to  “Check Out” or “Place Order”. At this point, the items in their shopping cart are usually  displayed on a Web page with an order form.  Secure ordering is facilitated through the use of SSL. Once an order is placed, there are a  number of methods by which to pay for the merchandise or service. The payment meth-  ods, called payment models, are cash, check, credit, smart card, and mobile payments.  Cash Model  The cash model is the most difficult to implement: How do you send cash through  a computer? You don’t. You use e-cash. You purchase digital money from a bank and  deposit it in a digital wallet. The transfer of funds is immediate. Vendors who provide  this service include InternetCash   http:  www.internetcash.com   and ECash Direct    http:  www.ecashdirect.net  .  Check Model  In the check model , the consumer writes a digital check to make the purchase. As  with real-world checks, the availability of funds must be verified and the funds are not  transferred immediately. One vendor that provides this service is Fiserv  formerly  CheckFree  at http:  www.checkfreecorp.fiserv.com .  Credit Model  Credit card payment processing is a very important component of an e-commerce web-  site. Funds from the customer need to be transferred to the merchant’s bank. In order to  accept credit cards, the site owner must apply for a merchant account and be approved.  498  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  A merchant account is a type of business bank account that allows a business to accept  credit card payments. You may also need real-time credit card verification using a merchant  gateway or third party such as Authorize.Net   http:  www.authorizenet.com  . While  merchant accounts can be expensive, there are low-cost solutions such as PayPal    http:  www.paypal.com   and Google Checkout   http:  checkout.google.com seller  .  Originally intended for consumer-to-consumer credit card sales, PayPal now offers credit  card and shopping cart services for business website owners. You can add an online  shopping experience to your website in minutes with Google’s Checkout Store Gadget    http:  storegadgetwizard.appspot.com storegadgetwizard   .  Smart Card Model  The smart card model is widely used in Europe, Australia, and Japan. A smart card  is similar to a credit card, but it has an integrated circuit instead of a magnetic strip  embedded in it. The smart card is inserted into a smart card reader. For more  information about smart cards, visit Smart Card Alliance    http:  www.smartcardalliance.org pages smart-cards-intro-primer  .  Mobile Payment Model  Juniper Research predicts large growth in the area of mobile payments and predicts that  by 2015, 2.5 billion people will use a mobile device to make a payment of some type     http:  www.ecommercetimes.com story 72807.html  . A  mobile payment  ,  also  called  an m- payment , is an electronic payment for goods or services using a mobile device  such as a smartphone. The emerging trend is to use near field communication   NFC  ,  described  by  TechSpot     http:  www.techspot.com guides 385-everything-about-nfc      as short-range wireless communication that uses a radio frequency to share information  between NFC devices in close proximity, such as NFC-equipped smartphones, NFC-ready  credit card readers, or NFC-ready ticket gates.  According to The Wall Street Journal   http:  on.wsj.com hzmzZt  , Google has partnered  with several credit card companies to include NFC technology in Android mobile devices  that would enable customers to wave the mobile device at a checkout counter reader  when making a purchase. The Google Wallet app running on an NFC-equipped Android  device can effectively “Make your phone your wallet”   http:  www.google.com wallet   .  Google’s competition in the field of mobile payments includes the ISIS mobile wallet    http:  www.paywithisis.com  , PayPal   http:  tinyurl.com paypal2011a  , and Visa  digital  wallet     http:  tinyurl.com visa2011a  .  Expect  more  developments  in  this  emerging technology.  12.8  E-Commerce Storefront Solutions  You have probably shopped at online stores and found some easy to work with and  others difficult. A large problem for e-commerce sites is abandoned shopping carts—  visitors who begin to shop but never place an order. This section explores types of  storefront solutions and shopping carts. A number of different e-commerce storefront  options are available to business owners and web developers. They range from a sim-  ple, instant online storefront supplied by another website to building your own  shopping cart system. This section examines some of the options.  12.8 E-Commerce Storefront Solutions  499  Instant Online Storefront  You supply the products, the instant online storefront does the rest. There is no need to  install software. All you do is use your web browser to point and click your way to a virtual  store. You use a template provided by the online storefront and choose features, configure  settings, and add your products, uploading images, descriptions, prices, and captions.  There are some disadvantages to this approach. You are limited to the templates offered  by the online storefront provider. The number of products that you can sell may also be  limited. Your store may have a look and feel that is similar to the other instant stores  hosted by the provider. However, this method provides a low-overhead, low-risk ap-  proach for a small business owner who has limited technical expertise. The storefront  provider will often offer merchant accounts and payment automation.  Some instant storefront solutions are free, with limited service or a limited number  of products. Others are fee-based and may charge hosting fees, processing fees, and  monthly fees. A few popular instant storefront solutions are Yahoo!    http:  smallbusiness.yahoo.com ecommerce   , Earthstores   http:  earthstores.com  ,  and Shopify   http:  www.shopify.com  . Artists and crafters have found a home on Etsy    http:  www.etsy.com   to create instant e-storefronts to display and sell their wares.  Off-the-Shelf Shopping Cart Software  With this approach, software that provides a standardized set of e-commerce features   is purchased, installed on your web server, and customized. Many web host providers  offer this storefront software, which usually includes a shopping cart, order processing,  and optional credit card payment processing. Shopping cart software provides an on-  line catalog where your visitors can browse, add items to their virtual shopping cart, and  check out through an order form when they are ready to make a purchase. Popular  shopping carts offered by web host providers are AgoraCart   http:  agoracart.com  ,  osCommerce   http:  oscommerce.com  , ZenCart    http:  www.zen-cart.com   , and Mercantec SoftCart   http:  www.mercantec.com  .  Custom-Built Solutions  Custom building a large-scale e-commerce website entirely from scratch usually requires  expertise, time, and a sizable budget! The advantage is that you get exactly what you  need. Software development tools for a custom-built site include Adobe Dreamweaver,  Microsoft Visual Studio.NET, Adobe ColdFusion, IBM’s WebSphere Commerce Studio, a  database management system  DBMS , and server-side scripting. Custom-built solu-  tions may also require a commerce server , which is a web server that is enhanced with  support for certain commerce activities. IBM’s WebSphere Commerce Suite and  Microsoft’s Commerce Server are two choices.  Semi-Custom-Built Solutions on a Budget  If the scope of your e-commerce endeavor is small and you want to avoid the cookie-  cutter look of an instant storefront, some other options may be worth considering. These  include getting pre-written shopping cart and order processing scripts, hiring a company  such as PayPal, and buying e-commerce add-ons to popular web-authoring tools.  500  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  There are a number of free shopping cart scripts available on the Web. Check out  ASPCode.net   http:  aspcode.net  , the PHP Resource Index   http:  php.resourceindex.com  ,  or Mal’s e-commerce   http:  www.mals-e.com   for some alternate solutions. The  level of difficulty and the exact processing of these solutions vary. Each website has  instructions and documentation for its product. Some may require you to register before  they provide you with specific HTML. Others may require you to download and install the  scripts on your own web server.  PayPal     http:  www.paypal.com    offers  a  shopping  cart  and  payment  verification  for businesses at a very low cost. PayPal writes the code that you need to place on your  web pages in order to interface with them. You only need to copy and paste it in. Google  Checkout  https:  checkout.google.com seller  offers a variety of options for adding an  e-commerce component to a website, including Buy Now buttons, Check Out buttons, a  shopping cart wizard, and checkout store gadget.  A number of Adobe Dreamweaver add-ins, or extensions, provide shopping cart  functionality. One easy solution is JustAddCommerce   http:  www.richmediatech.com  ,  which allows you to configure and add a shopping cart and order buttons to your pages  just as easily as you can add images and tables. Budget-wise solutions such as PayPal,  Google Checkout, or JustAddCommerce work best for businesses that fit the standard   business model and do not require special processing needs.

In this Hands-On Exercise, you will create an instant storefront. Choose one of the  following websites that offer free trial online stores: Earthstores   http:  earthstores.com  ,  AAcart   http:  www.aacart.com  , InstanteStore   http:  www.instantestore.com  ,  Shopify   http:  www.shopify.com  , BigCommerce   http:  www.bigcommerce.com  ,  or EasyStoreCreator   http:  www.easystorecreator.com  . Websites are constantly  changing their policies, so these sites may no longer offer free trials when you do this  assignment. If this is the case, check the textbook’s website for updated information,  ask your instructor for assistance, or search the Web for free online storefronts or trial  stores. If you are certain that you have found a website that offers a free trial store,  continue with this exercise and create a store that meets the following criteria:  ● Name: Door County Images  ● Purpose: To sell fine quality prints of Door County scenery  ● Target Audience: Adults age 40+ who have visited Door County; are middle to  upper class; and who enjoy nature, boating, hiking, cycling, and fishing  ● Item 1: Print of Ellison Bay at Sunset, Size: 11 inches by 14 inches, Price: $19.95  ● Item 2: Print of Ellison Bay in Summer, Size: 11 inches by 14 inches, Price: $19.95   Chapter Summary  503  Create a folder called doorcounty. Copy the following images from the chapter 12  folder in the student files to your doorcounty folder: summer.jpg, summer_small.jpg,  sunnydays.jpg, sunset.jpg, and sunset_small.jpg. Once you are organized, visit the  website you have chosen to host your free store. You will have to log in, choose  options, and upload your images. Follow the instructions provided. Most free online  store sites have an FAQ section or technical support to help you. Figure 12.4 shows a  page from a sample store using a BigCommerce instant storefront. After you have  completed your store, print out the browser view of the home page and catalog page.

This  chapter adds a catalog page for an online store to the websites. This catalog page  will connect to sample shopping cart and order pages on the textbook website at  http:  www.webdevfoundations.net .   Website Case Study  505  JavaJam Coffee House  See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the JavaJam Coff ee House case study. Use the  Chapter 9 JavaJam website as a starting point for this case study. As frequently happens  with websites, the client, Julio Perez, is pleased with the response to the site and has an  idea about a new use for it—selling JavaJam gear, such as T-shirts and coff ee mugs. This  new page, gear.html, will be part of the main navigation of the site. All pages should link  to it. A revised site map is shown in Figure 12.5 .  Figure 12.5 Revised JavaJam site map  The Gear page should contain a description, image, and price for each product. It should  link to a shopping cart system when the visitor wants to purchase an item. You may  access a demonstration shopping cart ordering system provided by the textbook’s  website. If you have access to a diff erent shopping cart system, check with your instructor  and ask if you can use it instead.  You have four tasks in this case study:  1.  Create a new folder for this JavaJam case study.  2. Modify the main navigation on each page to include a link to the new Gear page.  3. Modify the javajam.css external CSS fi le.  4. Create the new Gear page  gear.html  shown in Figure 12.6 .  Hands-On Practice Case Study  Task 1: Create a Folder. Create a folder called javajam12. Copy all of the fi les from  your Chapter 9 javajam9 folder into the javajam12 folder. Copy the javamug.gif and  javatshirt.gif images from the chapter12 folder in the student fi les and save them to your  javajam12 folder.  Task 2: Update the Navigation on Each Page. Launch a text editor and open the home  page  index.html . Add a new list item and hyperlink in the main navigation area that  displays the text “Gear” and links to the fi le gear.html. See Figure 12.6 for an example of  the navigation area. Save the fi le. Edit the Menu  menu.html , Music  music.html , and  Jobs  jobs.html  pages in a similar manner and save each fi le.  Task 3: Configure the CSS. Launch a text editor and open javajam.css. Before you create  the Gear page  gear.html , you will add a new style rule to your javajam.css external style  sheet that confi gures a class named clearright . The clearright class will be used to  clear a right fl oat. The style rule is  .clearright { clear: right; }  Task 4: Create the New Gear Page. One way to be productive is to create pages based  on your earlier work. Launch a text editor and open the Music page  music.html . Save   506  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  Figure 12.6 New JavaJam Gear page  the fi le as gear.html. This will give you a head start and ensure that the pages on the  website are similar. Perform the following modifi cations:  a. Change the page title to an appropriate phrase.  b. Delete the contents of the div assigned to the content id.  c. Place each sentence below in a separate paragraph:  JavaJam gear not only looks good, it’s good to your wallet, too.  Get a 10% discount when you wear a JavaJam shirt or bring in your JavaJam mug!  d. Code the text “JavaJam Gear” with an h2 element.  e. Confi gure an image element to display the javashirt.gif graphic. Assign the image to  the floatright class.  Confi gure the following text in a paragraph: “JavaJam shirts are comfortable to wear  to school and around town. 100% cotton. XL only. $14.95”  g. Code a line break tag below the paragraph. Assign the line break tag to the  h. Confi gure an image element to display the javamug.gif graphic. Assign the image to  f.  i.  clearright class.  the floatright class.  Confi gure the following text in a paragraph: “JavaJam mugs carry a full load of  caff eine  12 oz.  to jump-start your morning. $9.95”.   Website Case Study  507  j.  Next you will add a shopping cart button to each item for sale. This is placed in a form. The  action on the form is the script called http:  www.webdevfoundations.net scripts cart.asp .  Remember that whenever you use server-side scripts, there will be some documentation  or specifi cations for you to follow. This script processes a limited shopping cart that works  with two items only. The gear.html web page will pass information to the script by using  hidden fi elds in the form that contains the button to invoke the script. Please pay careful  attention to detail when working on this.  To place the shopping cart button for the T-shirt, add the following code below the  paragraph that describes the T-shirt and above the line break tag.  <form method="post"  action="http:  www.webdevfoundations.net scripts cart.asp">              This HTML invokes a server-side script that processes a demonstration shopping cart.  The hidden fi elds named desc1 and cost1 are sent to the script when the Submit  button is clicked. These indicate the name and cost of the item.  The process for adding the shopping cart button for the mug is similar, using hidden  form fi elds named desc2 and cost2 . Add the following code below the paragraph  that contains the description of the mug.  <form method="post"  action="http:  www.webdevfoundations.net scripts cart.asp">              Save your page and test it in a browser. It should look similar to the one shown in Figure  12.6 . Click the Add to Cart button for the JavaJam shirt. The demonstration shopping cart  will display and your screen should look similar to the one shown in Figure 12.7 .  Figure 12.7 A Shopping Cart page  created by the server-side script  that processes the shopping cart   and order  Experiment with the cart and try to purchase both items. Simulate placing an order, as shown  in Figure 12.8 . The shopping cart and order pages are for demonstration purposes only.  508  Chapter 12 E-Commerce Overview  Figure 12.8 An Order  page created by the  server-side script  that processes the  shopping cart order  FAQ How does the cart.asp server-side script work?  The cart.asp file is an ASP script. It is coded to accept a number of form fields and to  process them. It creates a web page based on the values and fields that were passed to  it. Table 12.3 shows the form fields and values used by the cart.asp file.  Table 12.3 Specifications for cart.asp  http:  www.webdevfoundations.net scripts cart.asp  This script accepts product and price information, displays a shopping cart, and finally displays an order page.

Fish Creek Animal Hospital  See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the Fish Creek Animal Hospital case study. You will  use the Chapter 9 fi shcreek9 folder as the starting point for this case study.   Website Case Study  509  After a site is initially created, it’s typical for a client to think of new ideas for the website.  The owner of Fish Creek, Magda Patel, is pleased with the response to the site and has a  new use for it—selling sweatshirts and tote bags with the Fish Creek logo. She already  has these materials for sale at her front desk in the animal hospital and her customers  seem to like them. This new Shop page  shop.html  will be part of the main navigation of  the site. All pages should link to it. A revised site map is shown in Figure 12.9 .  Figure 12.9 Revised Fish  Creek site map  The Shop page should contain the description, image, and price of each product. It  should link to a shopping cart system when the visitor wants to purchase an item. You  may access a demonstration shopping cart ordering system provided by the textbook’s  website.

Confi gure the jeweltone.jpg.  Next, we will add a shopping cart button to each gift item for selection. The action  on the form is the ASP script called http:  webdevfoundations.net scripts cart1.asp.  Remember that whenever you use server-side scripts, there will be some documenta-  tion or specifi cations for you to follow. This script processes a limited shopping cart  that only works with two items. Because it is designed to function as a gift selec-  tor, no prices are displayed. The services.html web page will pass information to  the script by using a hidden fi eld in the form that contains the button to invoke the  script. Please pay careful attention to detail when working on this.  To place the shopping cart button for the Sunny Days Basket, add the following code  below the image tag for the sunnydays.jpg graphic:  <form method="post"  action="http:  www.webdevfoundations.net scripts cart1.asp">  <input type="hidden" name="desc1" id="desc1"  value="Sunny Days Basket">        script.  j.  This HTML invokes a server-side script that processes a demonstration shopping  cart. The hidden fi eld named desc1 and its value are sent to the script when the  Submit button is clicked. This passes the name of the item chosen to the server-side  The process for adding the shopping cart button for the Jewel-tone Basket is similar,  using the hidden form fi eld desc2 . The HTML is  <form method="post"  action="http:  www.webdevfoundations.net scripts cart1.asp">  <input type="hidden" name="desc2" id="desc2"   value="Jewel-tone Basket">        517  Website Case Study  Save your page and test it in a browser. It should look similar to the one shown in  Figure 12.14 . Click the Place in Cart button for the Sunny Days Basket. The demonstration  shopping cart will display and your screen should be similar to the one pictured in  Figure 12.7  except that no price information will display . Experiment with the cart and  try to select both items. You can simulate selecting gifts. The shopping cart and order  pages are for demonstration purposes only.  Web Project  See Chapter 5 for an introduction to the Web Project. Review the goals of your website  and determine whether they include an e-commerce component. If so, you will add this  component to your web project.  Hands-On Practice Case Study  Revise the site map as needed to include the e-commerce component. Perhaps you will  add a Products page to your website. Perhaps the Products page already exists and you  are just adding functionality to the page. In either case, make sure that the site map and  content sheets refl ect the new processing.  There are a number of free or low-cost shopping cart providers on the Web.

Once you have visitors, how do you encourage them to return? Getting  listed on search engines, site affiliations, and banner ads are some of the  topics that are discussed in this chapter.  to your  519  520  13.1  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  Search Engine Overview  What do you do when you need to find a website? Most people launch their favorite  search engine. A Nielsen NetRatings survey found that 9 out of 10 web users visit a  search engine, portal, or community site every month. These web users also revisit the  sites frequently, almost five times per month.  Using a search engine is a popular way to navigate the Web and find websites.  The PEW Internet and American Life Project   http:  www.pewinternet.org Reports   2010 Generations-2010 Activities All-age-groups.aspx   reports that 87% of American adults use a search engine daily. A Direct Marketing News report    http:  www.dmnews.com cms dm-news search-marketing 37367.html   on a Harris Interactive study states that 80% of Internet traffic begins at a search engine.  A search engine listing helps customers find your site and increases the chances that  they will make a purchase. Search engine listings can be an excellent marketing tool for  your business. To harness the power of search engines and search indexes  sometimes  called search directories , it helps to know how they work.  13.2  Popular Search Engines  According to NetMarketShare    http:  marketshare.hitslink.com search-engine-market-share.aspx  , Google    http:  www.google.com   and Yahoo!   http:  www.yahoo.com   were the two most  popular sites used to search the Web during a recent month. Google was reported to  have an overwhelming market share of almost 84%, while the closest competitors were  Yahoo  6.21% , Baidu  4.64% , and Microsoft’s Bing at http:  www.bing.com  3.57% .  Check http:  marketshare.hitslink.com for the most recent survey results.  Google’s popularity has continued to grow since it was founded in the late 1990s. The  simple and whimsical interface, combined with quick-loading and useful results, has  made it a favorite of web users. The second most popular search engine is Yahoo!  Although Yahoo! is now a search engine, it originally was a search index  also called a  search directory  . Each site that is submitted for inclusion in a search directory is re-  viewed by a person. An example of a current search index is the Open Directory Project    http:  www.dmoz.org  . It contains a hierarchy of topics and sites related to each topic.  In this project, anyone can volunteer to be an editor and site reviewer. There is no cost  to submit your site to the Open Directory Project. An added benefit to being listed in the  Open Directory Project is that the database containing the approved sites is used by a  number of search engines, including Google and Ask.com.   Components of a Search Engine  Search engines have the following components:  ● Database  also used by search directories   ● Search form  also used by search directories   13.3 Components of a Search Engine  13.3  ● Robot  521  Robot  A robot  sometimes called a spider or bot  is a program that automatically traverses the  hypertext structure of the Web by retrieving a web page document and following the  hyperlinks on the page. It moves like a robot spider on the Web, accessing and docu-  menting web pages. The robot categorizes the pages and stores information about the  website and the web pages in a database. Various robots may work differently, but, in  general, they access and may store the following sections of web pages: title, meta tag  descriptions, and some of the text on the page  usually either the first few sentences or  the text contained in heading tags . Visit Web Robots Pages   http:  www.robotstxt.org    if you’d like more details about web robots.  Database  A database is a collection of information which is organized so that its contents can  easily be accessed, managed, and updated. A database management system  DBMS ,  such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or IBM DB2, is used to configure and manage  the database. The web page that displays the results of your search has information  from the database accessed by the search engine site. According to Bruce Clay     http:  www.bruceclay.com searchenginerelationshipchart.htm  , some search engines receive portions of their content from other search engines. For example, AOL Search  receives its primary content from Google.  Search Form  The search form is the component of a search engine that you are most familiar with.  You have probably used a search engine many times but haven’t thought about what  goes on “under the hood.” The search form is the graphical user interface that allows  a user to type in a word or phrase to search for. It is usually simply a text box and a  submit button. The visitor to the search engine types in words  called keywords   related to his or her search into the text box. When the form is submitted, the data  typed into the text box is sent to a server-side script that searches the database using  the keywords entered. The search results  also called a result set  are a list of infor-  mation, such as the URLs for web pages, that meets your criteria. This result set is  formatted with a link to each page, along with additional information which might  include the page title, a brief description, the first few lines of text, or the size of the  page. The type of additional information varies by search engine. Next, the web server  at the search engine site sends the search engine results page  SERP  to your browser  for display.  The order in which the pages are displayed may depend on paid advertisements, alpha-  betical order, and link popularity  more on this later . Each search engine has its own  policy for ordering the search results. Be aware that these policies can change over time.   The components of a search engine  robot, database, and search form  work together to  obtain information about web pages, store information about web pages, and provide a  graphical user interface to facilitate searching for and displaying a list of web pages that  are relevant to the given keywords. Now that you are aware of the components of search  engines, let’s get to the most important part: how to design your pages to promote  your website.  522  13.4  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  Search Engine Optimization  If you have followed recommended web design practices, you’ve already designed your  website so that the pages are appealing and compelling to your target audience. How  can you also make your site work with search engines? This section provides some  suggestions and hints on designing your pages for search engines—a process called  search engine optimization  SEO  .  Keywords  website or business are your keywords .  Page Titles  Spend some time brainstorming about terms and phrases that people may use when  searching for your site. Make a list of them. These terms or phrases that describe your  A descriptive page title  the text between the   tags , which includes your company  and or website name, will help your site market itself. It’s common for search engines  to display the text in the page title in the SERP. The page title is also saved by default  when a visitor bookmarks your site and is often included when a visitor prints a page of  your site. Avoid using the exact same title for every page; include keywords in the page  title that are appropriate for the page. For example, instead of just “Trillium Media  Design,” configure the page title to include both the company name and the purpose of  the page: “Trillium Media Design: Custom E-Commerce Solutions.”  Heading Tags  Use structural tags, such as   ,   , and so on, to organize your page content. If it is  appropriate for the web page content, also include some keywords in the text contained  within the heading tags. Some search engines will give a higher list position if keywords  are included in a page title or heading. Also include keywords, as appropriate, within the  page text content. However, avoid spamming keywords—that is, do not list them over  and over again. The programs behind search engines are becoming more sophisticated  all the time and you can actually be prevented from being listed if it is perceived that  you are not being honest or are trying to cheat the system.  Description  What is special about your website that would make someone want to visit? With this in  mind, write a few sentences about your website or business. This description should be  inviting and interesting so that a person searching the Web will choose your site from  the list provided by a search engine or search directory. Some search engines will display  your description in their search engine results. You might be wondering how these are  applied to the actual web pages. The description is placed on a web page by adding an  HTML meta tag to the head section.   Description Meta Tag  A meta tag is a self-contained tag that is placed in the head section of a web page.  You’ve been using a meta tag to indicate character encoding. There are a number of  13.4 Search Engine Optimization  523  other uses for meta tags. We’ll focus here on providing a description of a website for use  by search engines. The description meta tag content is displayed on the SERP by some  search engines, such as Google. The name attribute indicates the use of the meta tag.  The content attribute indicates the values needed for that specific use. The description  value for the name attribute indicates that the use of the meta tag is to provide a descrip-  tion. For example, a description meta tag for a website about a web development  consulting firm called Acme Design could be configured as follows:  <meta name="description" content="Acme Design, a premier web  consulting group that specializes in e-commerce, web design, web  development, and website redesign.">  FAQ What if I do not want a search engine to index a page?  Sometimes there will be pages that you do not want indexed, perhaps test pages or pages  only meant for a small group of individuals  such as family or coworkers . Meta tags can be  used for this purpose also. To indicate to a search engine robot that a page should not be in-  dexed and the links should not be followed, do not code a description meta tag in the page.  Instead, add a robots meta tag to the page as follows:     Linking  Verify that all hyperlinks are working. Each page on your website should be reachable by a  text hyperlink. The text should be descriptive  avoid phrases like “More info” and “Click  here”  and should include keywords as appropriate. Inbound links  sometimes called  incoming links  are also a factor in SEO; see the link popularity section later in this chapter.  Images and Multimedia  Be mindful that search engine robots do not “see” the text embedded within your images  and multimedia. Configure meaningful alternate text for images. Include relevant keywords  in the alternate text. Although some search engine robots, such as Google’s Googlebot,  have recently added the functionality to index text and hyperlinks contained within Flash  media, be aware that a website that depends on the use of technologies such as Flash and  Silverlight will be less visible to search engines and may rank lower as a result.  Valid Code  Content of Value  Search engines do not require that your HTML and CSS code pass validation tests.  However, code that is valid and well structured is likely to be more easily processed by  search engine robots. This may help with your placement in the search engine results.  Probably the most basic, but often overlooked, component of SEO is providing content  of value contained within a website that follows web design best practices  see   Chapter 5  . Your website should contain high-quality, well-organized content that is of  524  13.5  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  value to your visitors.  Listing in a Search Engine  Although search engines bring visitors to your website, it is not always easy to get listed  in a search engine or search directory. Before you even think about submitting your  website to a search engine, be sure that it is complete and that you have followed basic  SEO techniques  as described in the previous section . Once you’re confident that your  website is ready, follow the steps listed below to submit your site for consideration by a  search engine:  Step 1. Visit the search engine website  such as http:  www.google.com or  http:  www.yahoo.com   and look for the “Add site” or “List URL” link.  This is typically on the home page or the About Us page. Be patient because  these links are sometimes not obvious. To submit your website to Google, visit  http:  www.google.com submityourcontent website-owner  and select the  “Add your URL” link.  Step 2. Sign in with your Google account, follow the directions listed on the page, and  submit the form to request that your site be added to the search engine. At other search  engines, there may be a fee for an automatic listing, called paid inclusion. Currently, there  is no fee to submit a site to Google.  Step 3. The spider from the search engine will index your site. This may take several weeks.  Step 4. Several weeks after you submit your website, check the search engine or search di-  rectory to see if your site is listed. If it is not listed, review your pages and check whether they  are optimized for search engines  see the next section  and display in common browsers.  If the website is for a business, you may want to consider paying for listing consideration  in a search engine or directory  often referred to as an express submit or express  inclusion , paying for preferential placement in search engine displays  called sponsoring  or advertising , and paying each time a visitor clicks the search engine’s link to your  site. Many businesses regard payment for these types of services as another marketing  expense, such as paying for a newspaper ad or a listing in the Yellow Pages.  FAQ Is advertising on a search engine worth the cost?  It depends. How much is it worth to your client to appear on the first page of the search engine  results? You select the keywords that will trigger the display of your ad. You also set your  monthly budget and the maximum amount to pay for each click. While costs and charges vary  by search engine, at this time, Google charges are based on cost per click—you’ll be charged  each time a visitor to Google clicks on your advertisement. Visit http:  google.com adwords for  more information about their program.  If you explore the paid advertising programs that search engines offer, you’ll encounter a  number of acronyms related to marketing. The most common are listed below:   ● CPC: Cost per click  CPC  also referred to as PPC, pay per click  is the price you are charged if you have  signed up for a paid sponsor or ad program and a visitor clicks on a link to your website.  13.5 Listing in a Search Engine  525  ● CPM: Cost per thousand impressions  or not the visitor clicks on your ad .  ● CTR: Click-through rate  CTR would be 20 100, or 20%.  Map Your Site  CPM is your cost for every 1,000 times that your ad is displayed on a web page  whether  CTR is the ratio of the number of times an ad is clicked on to the number of times an ad  is viewed. For example, if your ad was shown 100 times and 20 people clicked on it, your  Google’s Webmaster Guidelines describe two types of site maps that are useful for SEO:  ● An HTML site map is a web page with a map of the site that contains a hierar-  chical list of hyperlinks to the major pages in your website  see Figure 5.14  .  The information on the site map page is not only helpful for your website  visitors, but also may assist search engine robots as they follow hyperlinks on  your site.  ● An XML Sitemap is an XML file that is used by search engines, but it is not  accessed by your web page visitors. A Sitemap provides information to a search  engine, such as Google, about your website and is essentially a list of pages,  along with the following information: date that each page was last modified, an  indicator of how frequently each page changes, and a priority level for each page.  An excerpt from a Sitemap file  sitemap.xml  is shown below:   http:  webdevfoundations.net     2011-07-03T08:10:09+00:00    monthly    1.00    http:  webdevfoundations.net index.html    2011-07-03T08:10:09+00:00    monthly    1.00                   http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter1.html    2011-08-22T15:09:07+00:00    monthly    0.800      Online Sitemap generators, such as http:  www.xml-sitemaps.com will automatically create  a Sitemap file, named sitemap.xml, for you. You will need to upload the Sitemap to your   website and notify Google of its URL. See http:  www.google.com support webmasters for  more information about Sitemaps.  526  Alliances  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  There are a number of alliances between certain search engines and search directories.  The Open Directory Project   http:  www.dmoz.org   provides directory services for a  number of search engines, including Google. Note that these alliances can change over  time. Awareness of search engine alliances will help you to maximize the chances of  your website turning up when a search is performed.  Checkpoint 13.1  1. Describe the three components of a search engine.  2. What is the purpose of the description meta tag?  3. Is it beneficial for a business to pay for preferential listing? Why or why not?  13.6  Monitoring Search Listings  Although you may want your website to appear instantaneously in search engines and  search directories, some time may be required before your site appears in the SERPs.  According  to  Enquiro  Search  Engine  Position     http:  searchengineposition.com  ,  it  can  take from 2 days to 2 weeks for a website to be listed on Google. Also, be mindful that  there is no guarantee when you submit your site that it will be listed; however, it is rare  that a quality website with content of value is not indexed and included in search  engine and search directory listings.  As your sites get listed, it becomes important to determine which keywords are working.  Usually, you need to fine-tune and modify your keywords over time. Here are a few  methods for determining which keywords are working:  ● Manual Checking. Visit search engines and type in the keywords. Assess the  results. You might consider keeping a record of the search engine, keyword s ,  and page ranking.  ● Web Analytics. The Web Analytics Association     http:  www.webanalyticsassociation.org    defines web  analytics  as  “the  measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of Internet data for the purposes  of understanding and optimizing web usage.” Every visitor to your website,  including those who were referred by search engines, is recorded in your website  log files. A website log consists of one or more text files that record each visit to  your site, capturing information about your visitors and about referring websites. You  can discover whether your keywords are successful and which search engines  are being used by analyzing your log. You can also determine the days and  times that your site is visited, the operating systems and browsers being used,  the paths that visitors take through the site, and much more. The log is a rather  cryptic text file. See Figure 13.1 for a partial log.  Web analytics software can analyze your log file and create easy-to-use charts and reports.   If you have your own website and domain name, many web host providers allow free  13.6 Monitoring Search Listings  527  Figure 13.1 A website log fi le contains useful information, but can be diffi cult to read  access to the log and may even run web analysis reports as part of the monthly hosting  fee. By checking information in the log, you can determine not only what keywords  are working, but also which search engines your visitors are using. Webtrends    http:  webtrends.com   is a commonly used tool for website log analysis. See Figure 13.2  for information from a log analysis report listing the top 10 keywords used by actual web  visitors when searching Google to find a particular website.  Figure 13.2 Partial log fi le analysis report  Website log analysis is a powerful marketing tool because you can determine exactly  how visitors are finding your site. This lets you know which keywords are working and  which are not. Perhaps with additional thought, you can add new variations of the pro-  ductive keywords to your list. If you examine Figure 13.2 , you will notice that tutorials  are quite popular for this particular website. The developers of this website could add  additional tutorials and potentially increase the number of visitors to the site.  528  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  Google offers a free web analytics service at http:  www.google.com analytics . The categories of reports provided are as follows:  ● Visitors  including a geographical map and browser information   ● Traffic Sources  such as referring sites, keywords, and AdWords    ● Content  including landing pages, paths through the site, and exit pages   ● Goals  tracks business objectives   Another option is to purchase a program that can help you monitor your search engine  positioning. Applications, such as WebPosition   http:  webposition.com  , can create  reports of your search engine rankings, analyze and track keywords, and even submit  your sites to search engines.  13.7  Link Popularity  Link popularity is a rating determined by a search engine based on the number of sites  that link to a particular website and the quality of those sites. For example, a link from a  well-known site such as Oprah Winfrey’s website   http:  www.oprah.com   would be  considered a higher quality link than one from your friend’s home page on a free web  server. The link popularity of your website can determine its order in the search engine  results page. One way to check which sites link to yours is to analyze your log file.  Another method is to visit a website that offers a link popularity checking service such  as LinkPopularity.com at http:  linkpopularity.com to run a report that checks link popularity on a number of search engines. A third method is to visit particular search  engines and check for yourself. At Google, type “link:yourdomainname.com” into the  search box and the sites that link to yourdomainname.com will be listed. Search engines  and search directories are not the only tools you can use to bring visitors to your website.  The next section looks at some other options.  13.8  Social Media Optimization  Reach out to your current and potential website visitors with social media optimization   SMO , which is described by Rohit Bhargava as optimizing a website so that it is “more  easily linked to, more highly visible in social media searches on custom search engines   such as Technorati , and more frequently included in relevant posts on blogs, podcasts  and vlogs.” The benefits of SMO include increased awareness of your brand and or site,  along with an increase in the number of inbound links  which can help with SEO . Visit  the following resources as a starting point as you search for three SMO tips or hints:  ● 5 Steps to Expand the Business Value of Social Customer Engagement:  http:  social-media-optimization.com  ● 5 Rules of Social Media Optimization  SMO :  http:  rohitbhargava.typepad.com weblog 2006 08 5_rules_of_soci.html  ● http:  www.toprankblog.com 2009 03 sxswi-interview-rohit-bhargava   A key principle of SMO is making tagging and bookmarking easy. Social bookmarking  sites such as Digg   http:  digg.com   and Delicious   http:  delicious.com   provide a way  13.9 Other Site Promotion Activities  529  for people to store, share, and categorize websites. Make it easy for your visitors to add  your site to social bookmarking services and social networking services like Twitter and  Facebook. You can code hyperlinks to these services yourself or use a content-sharing  service such as AddThis   http:  www.addthis.com  .  Blogs and RSS Feeds  Chapter 1 introduced blogs , which are easily updatable and readily available journals on   the Web. The power of the blog to share information and elicit comments is being used by  businesses of various types  ranging from Nike to Adobe  to build and expand customer  relationships. Most blog hosting sites, such as Google’s Blogger   http:  blogger.com   and  WordPress   http:  wordpress.com  , offer free RSS  Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site  Summary  feeds of blog content. The RSS feed for a blog is an XML file  with an .rss file  extension  that contains a summary of postings with links to a blog or another website.  Your customers or business partners can subscribe to the RSS feed and automatically be  updated when you’ve posted new content. RSS feeds are usually identified by an orange  button with “XML” or “RSS” in the text. The Firefox browser has a feature called Live  Bookmarks, which displays RSS news and blog headlines. There are numerous free and  low-cost RSS readers available, including Headline Viewer   http:  www.headlineviewer.com    and NetNewsWire   http:  netnewswireapp.com  . To see a blog in action, visit this textbook’s  blog at http:  webdevfoundations.blogspot.com .  Social Networking  Join groups on social networking sites such as Facebook   http:  www.facebook.com  ,  Google+   http:  plus.google.com  , or LinkedIn   http:  www.linkedin.com    to find and connect with current and potential visitors. Create portable content that  promotes your website and publish it on YouTube   http:  www.youtube.com  ,  SlideShare   http:  www.slideshare.net  , and other similar sites.  Be active on microblogging sites such as Twitter   http:  twitter.com  .

Blog and tweet about your content. Let viral marketing go to work for you as  current and potential visitors find and share your content, which should increase  awareness and bring new and returning visitors to your site.  13.9  Other Site Promotion Activities  There are a number of other ways you can promote your website, including Quick  Response  QR  codes, affiliate programs, banner ads, banner exchanges, reciprocal link  agreements, newsletters, personal recommendations, traditional media advertising, and  placement of the URL on all promotional materials.  Quick Response  QR  Codes  A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode in a square pattern that is readable by a  smartphone camera scan application or a QR barcode reader. The data encoded  can be text, a telephone number, or even the URL of a website. ClickZ reports that  the popularity of QR codes is increasing because of increased smartphone use  530  Chapter 13 Web Promotion    http:  www.clickz.com clickz column 2039242 qr-codes-matter  . There are many   free online QR code generators, including http:  qrcode.kaywa.com ,  http:  www.labeljoy.com en generate-qr-code.html  such as ScanLife and QR Code Scanner, are available for Apple, Android, and  , a n d http:  www.qrstuff.com   . Free  apps,  BlackBerry smartphones that use the camera feature to scan the QR code, typically a  URL for a website, which is then displayed by the smartphone’s web browser. QR  codes are useful for promoting a website; include it on your business card or even a  T-shirt! The QR code in Figure 13.3 displays the home page of the textbook’s website  Figure 13.3 QR code    http:  webdevfoundations.net  .  for http:    webdevfoundations.net  Affiliate Programs  The essence of affiliate programs is that one website  the affiliate  promotes another  website’s products or services  the merchant  in exchange for a commission. Both  websites benefit from this association. Amazon.com reportedly began the first affiliate  marketing program and its Amazon.com Associates program is still going strong. By  joining this program, your website can feature books and other products with a link to  the Amazon website. If one of your visitors makes a purchase, you get a commission.  Amazon benefits because you have delivered an interested visitor who may buy items  now or in the future. Your site benefits from the prestige of being affiliated with a known  site such as Amazon and the potential for income from the program.

Banner Ads  A banner ad is typically a graphic image that is used to announce and advertise the  name or identity of a site. Banner ads are image hyperlinks that display the advertised  site when clicked. You probably see them many times as you surf the Web. They’ve been  around for quite some time; HotWired , the first commercial web magazine, introduced  the first banner ad in 1994 to promote AT&T.  There is no official size for a banner ad. However, the Interactive Advertising  Bureau   http:  www.iab.net   provides guidelines for typical ads, including  a leaderboard banner  728×90 pixels  and a medium rectangle  300×250 pixels .  Visit its website for a full listing of types of ads and common sizes    http:  www.iab.net iab_products_and_industry_services 508676 508767 Ad_Unit  .  The cost to display your banner ad can vary. Some websites charge by the impression  usu-  ally in terms of cost per thousand impressions, or CPM . Others charge for click-throughs  only  when the banner ad is clicked . Some search engines sell banner ads and will display  your ad on a results page for a keyword that relates to your site  for a fee, of course! .  The effectiveness of banner ads has been a topic of study. If you are like most website  visitors, you do not click on banner ads. This means that banner ads do not necessarily   generate more immediate visitors to a site. The Interactive Advertising Bureau  13.9 Other Site Promotion Activities  531  researched the relationship between banner ads and brand awareness. A ClickZ    http:  www.clickz.com stats sectors advertising article.php 804761   report about this  classic study indicates that while standard banner ads helped boost brand awareness,  other formats such as skyscrapers  long, skinny ads that run down one side of a page   and larger rectangular ads were three to six times more effective in increasing brand  awareness and message association. Media technologies such as audio, video, and  Flash also have a greater impact and increase branding effectiveness. Of course, the  thinking is that increased brand awareness will increase the likelihood of an actual  website visit in the future. If the cost associated with banner ads seems to outweigh  their benefits, consider a free option, a banner exchange.  Banner Exchange  While the details of banner exchange programs vary, the idea is that you agree to show  banners from other sites and they will show your banner. Information on banner ex-  changes may be found at ExchangeAd   http:  www.exchangead.com   and Impressionz     http:  www.impressionz.com  . Banner exchanges can be beneficial to all parties because of the free advertising.  Reciprocal Link Agreements  A reciprocal link agreement is usually between two sites with related or complementary  content. You agree to link to each other. The result should be more visitors for each site.  If you find a site that you’d like to set up a reciprocal link agreement with, contact its  webmaster  usually by e-mail  and ask! Because some search engines partially deter-  mine rankings based on the number of quality links to a website, a well-placed recipro-  A newsletter can bring return visitors to your site.

Newsletters  Figure 13.4  Sample newsletter  subscription form   532  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  Offer your visitors some perceived value—timely information on a topic, discounts, and  so on. Send out the newsletter with fresh, compelling content regularly. This helps to re-  mind your previous visitors about your site. They may even forward the newsletter to a  colleague and bring a new visitor to your site.  Sticky Site Features  Updating your website often and keeping your content fresh will encourage visitors to  return to your site. How can you keep them there? Make your website sticky. Stickiness  is the ability to keep visitors at your site. Display your interesting and compelling con-  tent along with features that encourage stickiness, such as news updates, polls and  surveys, and chats or message boards.  Personal Recommendations  While forwarding a newsletter is a form of personal recommendation , some sites make  it even easier to tell a friend about them. They offer a link that is used with a phrase  such as “E-mail this article”, “Send this page to a friend”, or “Tell a colleague about this  site”. This personal recommendation brings a new visitor who is likely to be interested  in the content of your site. See Figure 13.5 for screenshot of the USA.gov website    http:  www.usa.gov  , showing personal recommendation options.  Figure 13.5 The USA.gov site makes it easy to tell friends about interesting articles  Newsgroup and Listserv Postings  Subscribe to relevant Usenet newsgroups , listservs , or forums related to your website  content. Do not reply to postings with an advertisement of your site. Instead, reply to  postings when your response can offer assistance or advice. Include a signature line  13.10 Serving Dynamic Content with Inline Frames  533   with your website URL. Be subtle! You can get banned from some listservs if the modera-  tor perceives that you are merely advertising. However, by offering friendly, helpful ad-  vice in a newsgroup or listserv you can market your website in a subtle, positive manner  at no cost other than your Internet connection. Your Internet service provider may provide  access to Usenet newsgroups. Google also provides access at http:  groups.google.com .  Listservs can be run by individuals or by organizations.  Traditional Media Ads and Existing Marketing Materials  Don’t forget to mention your website in any print, TV, or radio ads that your organization  runs. Include the URL of your website on all brochures, stationery, and business cards.  This will help make your website easy to find by your current and potential customers.  Depending upon your target audience, also consider including a QR code for your web-  site on printed materials.  Checkpoint 13.2  1. Are the results returned by various search engines really different? Choose a place, music  group, or movie to search for. Enter the same search terms, such as “Door County” into the  following three search engines: Google, Yahoo!, and Bing   http:  www.bing.com  . List the  URLs of the top three sites returned by each.

How do the Chicago Bears   http:  www.chicagobears.com   and ABC    http:  abc.com   home pages easily display a variety of multimedia clips? How are the  potential customer referrals provided by the Amazon.com Associates program initiated  and tracked? How does Google facilitate Ad Sense advertisement displays and click-  throughs on third-party websites? At the time this was written, the answer to all of these  questions is inline frames. Inline frames are widely used on the Web for a variety of  marketing and promotional purposes, including displaying banner ads, playing multimedia  that may be hosted on a separate web server, and serving content for associate and  partner sites to display. The advantage is separation of control. The dynamic content—  such as the banner ad or multimedia clip—can be changed by a project team without  allowing them access to change the rest of the website. For example, in the case of the  banner ad served by the Edmunds.com website, a third-party organization  such as  DoubleClick  has control over the ad content, but is prevented from updating the other  items on the Edmunds home page. This is accomplished by configuring the dynamic   534  Chapter 13 Web Promotion  frames are configured.  The iframe Element  content  in the form of banner ads  within an inline frame. Let’s explore how inline  An inline frame , also called a floating frame, can be placed on the body of any web  page, similar to the way you would place an image on a web page. The iframe element  configures an inline frame that displays the contents of another web page within your  web page document, which is referred to as nested browsing . The iframe element begins  with the   tag and ends with the   tag. Fallback content that should  be displayed if the browser does not support inline frames  such as a text description or  hyperlink to the actual web page  should be placed between the tags. Figure 13.6  shows the use of an inline frame  chapter13 dcwildflowers index.html in the student  files . The white background area is the inline frame; it displays another web page that  contains the image of the flower and a text description.

JavaScript is a  scripting language and JavaScript commands can be included in an HTML file.  Using JavaScript, you can incorporate techniques and effects that will make  your web pages come alive! You can display an alert box containing an important  message for the user. You can display an image when a user moves the mouse  pointer over a link and much more. This chapter introduces JavaScript and  some of its capabilities, and provides some samples that you can build on to  create your own web pages.  543  544  14.1  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  Overview of JavaScript  There are a variety of methods for adding interactivity to a web page. As you learned  in Chapter 7 , CSS can be used to achieve a hover effect as you position your mouse  pointer over a hypertext link. CSS can also be used for interactive effects, including  an image gallery and the new CSS3 transitions and transforms. In Chapter 11 , you saw  examples of how JavaScript can be used to add interactivity and functionality to  web pages.  So, what is JavaScript? It’s an object-based, client-side scripting language interpreted  by a web browser. JavaScript is considered to be object-based because it’s used to  work with the objects associated with a web page document : the browser window, the  document itself, and elements such as forms, images, and links. Because JavaScript  is interpreted by a browser, it is considered to be a client-side scripting language. A  scripting language is a type of programming language, but no need to worry! You don’t  have to be a computer programmer to understand this.  Let’s review clients and servers. In Chapter 10 , we discussed hosting a website on a web  server. As you learned, a web host provider allows you to transfer your files to the web  server and stores your website. Visitors to your site  also called users  are able to point  their web browsers to your website using the URL provided by your web host provider.  As you may recall, the user’s web browser is called a client.  JavaScript is interpreted by the client. This means that the JavaScript code, embedded  in the HTML document, will be rendered by the browser. The server’s job is to provide  the HTML document. The web browser’s job is to interpret the code in the HTML file  and display the web page accordingly. Because all the processing is performed by  the client  in this case, the web browser , this is referred to as client-side processing .  There are programming languages that are executed on the server, which are  referred to as server-side programming languages. Server-side processing may  involve sending e-mail, storing items in a database, or tracking items in a shopping  cart. In Chapter 9 , you learned how to set the action of a form to point to a server-  side script.  In summary, JavaScript is an object-based, client-side scripting language interpreted by  a web browser. The JavaScript code is embedded in the HTML file and the web browser  interprets it and displays the results as needed.   14.2  The Development of JavaScript  There is a popular misconception that Java and JavaScript are the same. Java and  JavaScript are completely separate languages with very little in common. As noted in  Chapter 11 , Java is an object-oriented programming language. Java is robust, is very  technical, and can be used to build large applications for businesses, such as inventory  control systems and payroll systems. Sun Microsystems developed Java in the 1990s  and designed the language to run on an operating system such as Windows or Unix.  The developers of Java also wanted the flexibility that would be available if their  language could run in a web browser. Independently, a team at Netscape was developing  a scripting language called LiveScript and eventually partnered with Sun Microsystems.  This partnership was mutually advantageous as it produced the Java plug-in that  enabled web browsers to run Java applets in the browser. The development of  14.3 Popular Uses for JavaScript  545  14.3  LiveScript continued and was renamed JavaScript. However, JavaScript is not the same  as the Java programming language. JavaScript is much simpler than Java. The two  languages have more differences than similarities.  Popular Uses for JavaScript  The uses of JavaScript range from providing some “bells and whistles,” such as simple  animation and fancy menus, to functionality, such as popping up a new window that  contains product information and detecting errors in a form. Let’s look at some examples  of some of these uses.  Alert Message  An alert message is a popular technique used to draw the user’s attention to something  that is happening. For instance, a retail website may use an alert message to list errors  in an order form or remind the user about an upcoming sale. Figure 14.1 illustrates an  alert message that thanks the user for visiting the page. This alert message is displayed  when the user is leaving the website and going to a new site.  Figure 14.1 Alert  message is  displayed when  the user leaves  the website   Notice that the user must click the OK button before the next page will load. This effec-  tively grabs the user’s attention, but it quickly becomes annoying if it is overused.  Popup Windows  And speaking of annoying, a popup window is a web browser window that may appear  when you interact with a web page by clicking on an image or hovering over a page area,  or it may seem to appear somewhat mysteriously. This technique has some legitimate  uses, such as popping up an information window that contains a larger picture and de-  scription of a product when the user clicks on the product in the main window.  Unfortunately, the use of popup windows has been so abused that most browsers allow  users to disable popup windows. This also means that the useful popup windows are  not displayed. Figure 14.2 shows a popup window that appears when the user clicks the  link on the main page.  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  546  Figure 14.2 The  smaller popup  window appears  when the user   JavaScript can also be used to create jump menus based on a select list as introduced  in Chapter 9 . The user can select a web page from a select list and click a button to load  the selected Web page. Figure 14.3 shows this technique.  In this example, the user selected the Contact Information option from the select list and  clicked the Go button. The Contact Information page will load in the browser window.  Mouse Movement Techniques  JavaScript can be used to perform a task based on mouse movement in the browser  window. One popular technique is to display a submenu when the user hovers the  mouse pointer over a menu item. Figure 14.4 shows this technique.  clicks on the link  in the larger  window  Jump Menus  Figure 14.3 Jump  menu that shows  the selection of  the Contact  Information menu  option  Figure 14.4 The  submenu is  displayed when  the user hovers  over the Products  menu item  14.4 Adding JavaScript to a Web Page  547  The window on the left shows the main menu and the window on the right shows the  submenu displayed when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the Products menu  item. When the user moves the mouse away from the Products menu item, the submenu  disappears. Mouse movements also trigger image swapping , often referred to as rollover  images. An image is displayed on the web page when the page initially loads. When the  user positions the mouse pointer on top of the image, the original image is swapped for  a new image. When the user moves the mouse away from the image, the original image  reappears. Figure 14.5 shows the image-swapping technique. For many years, this tech-  nique was commonly used for navigation button bars. However, modern web developers  typically use CSS to configure similar effects with the :hover pseudo-class, such as   changing the background color or background image of an element.  Figure 14.5 The  original image is  on the left and the  swapped image  is on the right with  the mouse pointer  hovering on the  image  In this chapter, we will touch on some of the highlights and concepts involved in using  JavaScript. We will create some scripts to demonstrate the use of the alert message,  mouseovers, and some of the techniques involved in checking a form for input errors.  This chapter offers just a taste of JavaScript, but it will give you on overview of how  some of the techniques are developed.  14.4  Adding JavaScript to a Web Page  JavaScript code is embedded in an HTML web page and is interpreted by the web  browser. This means that the web browser is capable of understanding the code and  running it. The examples in this chapter use the Mozilla Firefox web browser. The code  we will create functions in most web browsers. However, we will use Firefox because it  will provide us with helpful error messages that will be invaluable when we create and  test our pages. If you have not already installed Mozilla Firefox on your computer, visit  http:  www.mozilla.com firefox for a free download.  Script Element  When JavaScript code is embedded in an HTML document, it needs to be contained, or  encapsulated, in a script element . The JavaScript is typed between the opening    tag and the closing   tag. Web pages are rendered by the browser from top to  bottom. The impact on our scripts is that they will execute wherever they are located in the  document. The script element requires a type attribute with the value text javascript .  JavaScript Statement Block Template  Within the script tags, we’ll use HTML comments before and after a JavaScript statement  block. HTML comments are contained between   markup symbols. The <!--  548  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  denotes the beginning of the HTML comment. The --> denotes the end of the HTML  comment. JavaScript comment lines begin with    . The text on that line is ignored by the  browser. We’ll use the HTML comment tag at the beginning of the JavaScript statement  block to hide JavaScript from older browsers. Some very old browsers will display the  JavaScript code rather than execute it. Encapsulating the JavaScript block in HTML  comment tags hides the block from older browsers and the code is ignored by browsers  that do not support it. Use the JavaScript comment    to begin the line with the closing   HTML comment. Each JavaScript block will have following structure:     The JavaScript code is placed inside the statement block. This block can appear any-  where in the HTML document and the code will be executed. Let’s see how this works  with a Hands-On Practice that will display an alert message.  Alert Message Box  The alert message box is displayed using the alert   method. The structure is  alert "message to be displayed" ;  Each JavaScript command line generally ends with a semicolon  ; . Also, JavaScript is  case-sensitive , which means that there’s a difference between uppercase and lower-  case characters and it will be important to be precise when typing JavaScript code.  In this Hands-On Practice, you will create a simple script with an alert message box. Launch a  text editor and type the following HTML and JavaScript code. Note that alert   does not  contain a space between alert and the opening parenthesis.  . JavaScript code goes here .  <!--  .  .  .  .    -->     VideoNote  JavaScipt  Message Box  Hands-On Practice 14.1            JavaScript Practice            <!--     -->            Using JavaScript      alert "Welcome to my web page!" ;   When does this display?    14.4 Adding JavaScript to a Web Page  549  Save this file as alert.html. Launch Firefox and open your page in the browser. Notice that the  first heading appears and then the alert message pops up  see Figure 14.6  . After you click the  OK button, the second heading appears. This illustrates the top-down processing of the web  page and the embedded JavaScript. The JavaScript block is between the headings and that’s  where the alert message appears as well.  Figure 14.6 JavaScript displays the  alert message box  alert.html   Practice with Debugging  Sometimes your JavaScript code does not work the first time you test it. When this happens,  you’ll need to debug the code—find the errors and correct them.  Let’s look at a debugging technique. Edit the JavaScript alert to introduce a typing error:  aalert "Welcome to my web page!" ;  Save the file and view it in the browser. Notice that the alert box does not display this time. Firefox will  point out some errors in JavaScript code, but we need to open the Error Console in order to see them.  In Firefox, select the menu item Tools > Web Developer > Error Console. The Error Console  window will open and the error message will display  see Figure 14.7  .  Figure 14.7 The Firefox Error  Console displays an error  Notice that the error is displayed, along with the line number where the error was detected. It’s  useful to create your documents in a text editor that displays the line numbers, but it’s not neces-  sary. If you are using Notepad, make use of the Go To feature in the Edit menu. This will allow  you to specify a line number and the insertion point will be positioned at the beginning of that   line.  display after the first heading.  Edit the alert.html file to correct the error and test it in the browser. This time the alert box should  550  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  FAQ Will the Error Console display all of the errors in my JavaScript code?  The Error Console will display the syntax errors, which include things like missing quotes and  items that it does not recognize. Sometimes the error is above the line indicated, particularly if  there is a missing parenthesis or quote. The errors displayed indicate that there is something  wrong and they serve as a guide as to where the error might be located. Start by looking at the  line indicated; if that line looks correct, look at the lines above it.  Checkpoint 14.1  1. Describe at least three popular uses for JavaScript.  2. How many JavaScript code blocks can be embedded in an HTML document?  3. Describe a method that can be used to find an error in a JavaScript code block.  14.5  Document Object Model Overview  JavaScript can manipulate the elements of an HTML document, such as container  tags like paragraphs, spans, and div elements. Elements also include images, forms,  and individual form elements such as text boxes and select lists. In order to access  these elements, we need to understand a little bit about the Document Object  Model  DOM .  In general, an object is an entity or a “thing”. When using the DOM, the browser  window, web page document, and any HTML element are considered to be objects.  The browser window is an object. When a web page loads in the browser, the web page  is considered to be a document. The document itself is an object. The document can  contain objects such as images, headings, paragraphs, and individual form elements  such as text boxes. The objects may have properties that can be detected or manipulated.  For example, a property of the document is its title. Another property of the document is  its background color.  There are actions that can be performed on some objects. For example, the window  object can display the alert message box or a prompt box. These actions are called  methods . The command to display an alert message is referred to as a method of the  window object. The DOM is the collection of objects, properties, and methods.  JavaScript uses the DOM to detect and manipulate the elements in the HTML document.  Let’s look at this system of objects, properties, and methods differently. Let’s say that  your car is an object. It has properties such as color, manufacturer, and year. Your car   has elements such as the hood and trunk. The hood and trunk can be opened and  closed. If we were to use a programming language to open and close the hood and  trunk, the commands might look something like the following:  car.hood.open    car.hood.close    car.trunk.open    car.trunk.close    14.5 Document Object Model Overview  551  look something like the following:  car.color  car.year  car.model  car.manufacturer  If we wanted to know the color, year, and manufacturer of the car, the commands might  When we use the values, car.color might be equal to “silver”, car.manufacturer  might be equal to “Nissan”, and car.model might be equal to “370Z”. We might be able  to change the values or only read them without changing them. In this example, car is  an object and its properties are hood, trunk, color, year, model, and manufacturer. Hood  and trunk could be considered properties as well. Open and close are methods of hood  and are also methods of trunk.  With respect to the DOM, we can write to the document using the write   method of  the document object. The structure is  document.write "text to be written to the document" ;  We can use this in JavaScript to write text and HTML tags to a document and the browser  will render it. The alert   method used in the previous Hands-On Practice is a method  of the window object. It can be written as  window.alert "message" ;  The window object is assumed to exist and can be omitted. If the window doesn’t exist,  the script doesn’t exist either.  One property of the document is lastModified . This property contains the date on  which the file was most recently saved or modified and we can access it using  document.lastModified . This is a read-only property that we can display in the  browser window or use for some other purpose.  Hands-On Practice 14.2  In this Hands-On Practice, you will practice using the write   method of the document and the  lastModified property of the document. You will use document.write   to add text and  some HTML tags to an HTML document. You will also use document.write   to write the  date the fi le was last saved to the document.  Open the alert.html file and edit the script block as follows:             JavaScript Practice         Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript   Using JavaScript      document.write " Using document.write to add text " ;  document.write " Notice that we can add HTML tags too! " ;   This document was last modifi ed on:     document.write document.lastModifi ed ;  552     <!--     -->     <!--     -->              Save this file as documentwrite.html and view it in the browser. The text should display   see Figure 14.8  . If the text does not display, open the Error Console and correct any errors  that appear.  Figure 14.8 The Firefox  browser displays  documentwrite.html  JavaScript can be seen in the source code. To confirm this, use the Tools > Web Developer >  Page Source menu command to see the source code. Close the source code window when  you have finished viewing the code.   FAQ Why would I use document.write when I can just type the HTML code  by itself?  In practice, you typically wouldn’t use document.write to generate your web page if you  could just type the HTML code by itself. You would use document.write in conjunction  with other techniques. For instance, you might use JavaScript to detect the time of day and,  if it is before noon, use document.write to write “Good morning” to the document. If it is  afternoon, write “Good afternoon” to the document, and if it is after 6:00 p.m., write  “Good evening” to the document.  14.6 Events and Event Handlers  553  14.6  Events and Event Handlers  As the user is viewing a web page, the browser detects mouse movement and events.  Events are actions taken by the web page visitor, such as clicking the mouse, loading  pages, or submitting forms. For instance, when you move your mouse pointer over a  hypertext link, the browser detects a mouseover event. Table 14.1 lists a few of the  events and their descriptions.  Table 14.1 Events and their descriptions  Event  Description  click  load  mouseover  mouseout  submit  unload  page loads.  The user clicks on an item. This could be an image, hypertext link, or button.  The browser displays a web page.  The mouse pointer hovers over an item. The mouse pointer does not have to rest  on the object. This could be a hypertext link, image, paragraph, or another object.  The mouse pointer is moved away from an item that it had previously hovered over.  The user clicks the submit button on a form.  The web page unloads in the browser. This event occurs just before a new web  When an event occurs, this can trigger some JavaScript code to execute. One widely  used technique is to detect the mouseover and mouseout events and swap images or  display a menu.  We need to indicate which events will be acted upon and what will be  Table 14.2 Events and event handlers  done when an event occurs. We can use an event handler to indicate  which event to target. An event handler is embedded in an HTML tag as an   Event  Event Handler  click  onclick  load  onload  mouseover  onmouseover  mouseout  onmouseout  submit  onsubmit  unload  onunload  attribute and indicates some JavaScript code to execute when the event  occurs. Event handlers use the event name with the prefix “on”. Table 14.2  shows the event handlers that correspond to the events described in  Table 14.1 . For example, the onload event is triggered when browser  renders  loads  a web page. When you move your mouse pointer over a  text hyperlink, a mouseover event occurs and is detected by the browser.  If that hyperlink contains an onmouseover event handler, the JavaScript  code indicated by the event handler will execute. This code might pop  up an alert message, display an image, or display a menu. Other event  handlers such as onclick and onmouseout can cause JavaScript code to execute when  their corresponding event occurs.  Hands-On Practice 14.3  Let’s practice using the onmouseover and onmouseout event handlers and alert messages to  indicate when the event handler has been triggered. We will use simple hypertext links and  embed the event handlers in the anchor tags. We will not need the   block because  event handlers are placed as attributes within the HTML tags. We’ll place the hypertext links in an  unordered list so that there’s a lot of room in the browser window to move the mouse pointer and  test our script.  554  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  Open a text editor and enter the code shown below. Note the use of the double and single  quotes in the onmouseover and onmouseout event handlers. We need quotes around the   message in the alert   method and we need quotes that encapsulate the JavaScript for the  event handler. HTML and JavaScript will allow us to use either double quotes or single quotes.  The rule is that they must match in pairs. So when you have a situation where you need two sets  of quotes, you can use both double and single quotes. Use double quotes for the outer set and  single  quotes  for  the  inner  set.  In  the  anchor  tag,  the    symbol  is  used  for  the  href  value because  we don’t need the functionality of loading another web page. We need the hypertext link to  sense mouseover and mouseout events.            JavaScript Practice       Using JavaScript            test    test               Mouseover    Mouseout  Save this file as mouseovertest.html and load it in the browser. Move your mouse on top  of the Mouseover test link. As soon as your mouse touches the link, the mouseover event  occurs and the onmouseover event handler is triggered. This displays the alert box   see Figure 14.9  .  Figure 14.9 Demonstration of onmouseover  Click the OK button and position your mouse pointer over the Mouseout test link. Notice that  nothing happens. This is because the mouseout event has not occurred yet.  Move the mouse pointer away from the link. As soon as the mouse pointer is no longer on the  link, the mouseout event occurs and the onmouseout event handler is triggered. This displays  the alert box  see Figure 14.10  . A suggested solution can be found in the student files   chapter14 mouseovertest.html .   14.7 Variables  555  Figure 14.10 Demonstration of onmouseout  You can combine event handlers in one hypertext link. This is the essence of the image-  swapping technique. The onmouseover event handler changes the image to a new image  and the onmouseout event handler changes the image back to the original image. This  technique is beyond the scope of this chapter, but perhaps this demonstration sheds some  light on how image swapping is accomplished.  Checkpoint 14.2  1. With respect to objects, describe the difference between a property and a method. Feel free  to use words like thing, action, description, attribute, and so on.  2. What is the difference between an event and an event handler?  3. Where are event handlers placed in the HTML document?  14.7  Variables  Sometimes we need to be able to collect information from the user. A simple example is  prompting the user for a name and writing the name to the document. We would store  the name in a variable . You probably took a math course at some point and used x and y  as variables in equations as placeholders for values. The same principle applies when  using variables in JavaScript.  We won’t do any tricky math here, so relax!  JavaScript  variables are also placeholders for data and the value of the variable can change.  Robust programming languages like C++ and Java have all kinds of rules for variables  and their data types. JavaScript is very loose that way. We won’t have to worry about  what type of data is contained in a variable.  FAQ Are there any tips for creating variable names?  Creating  the  name  of  a  variable  is  really  something  of  an  art  form.  First  of  all,  you  want  to create  a  variable  name  that  describes  the  data  it  contains.  The  underscore,  or  an  uppercase character,  can  be  used  for  readability  to  indicate  more  than  one  word.  Do  not  use  other  special characters,  though. Stick to letters and numbers. Be careful not to use JavaScript reserved words or   556  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  keywords , such as var , return , function , and so on. A list of JavaScript keywords can be  found at http:  www.webreference.com javascript reference core_ref . The following are some  variable names that could be used for a product code:  Before we use a variable, we can declare it with the JavaScript var keyword. This step  isn’t necessary, but it is good programming practice. We can assign data to a variable  using the assignment operator, the equal sign  = . A variable can contain a number or a  string. A string is encapsulated in quotes and can contain alphabetic characters,  spaces, numbers, and special characters. For instance, a string can be a last name,  e-mail address, street address, product code, or paragraph of information. Let’s do a  practice exercise that assigns data to a variable and writes it to the document.  In this Hands-On Practice, you will declare a variable, assign string data to it, and write it to the  Open a text editor and type the following:  ● productCode  ● prodCode  ● product_code  Writing a Variable to a Web Page  Hands-On Practice 14.4  document.            JavaScript Practice             Hello   Using JavaScript      <!--  var userName;  userName = "Karen";  document.write userName ;     -->              Notice that the   tag is placed before the script block and the   tag is placed after the  script block. This renders the value of userName in the   heading format. There is also a  single space after the “o” in “Hello”. If you miss this space, you’ll see the userName value  displayed right after the “o”.   14.7 Variables  557  Notice that the variable is mixed case. This is a convention used in many programming  languages to make the variable readable. Some developers might use an underscore, like  user_name. Selecting a variable name is somewhat of an art form, but try to select names  that indicate the contents of the variable.  Also notice that the document.write   method does not contain quotes. The contents  of the variable will be written to the document. If we had used quotes around the variable  name, the variable name itself would be written to the document and not the contents of  Save this document as variablewrite.html and load it in the browser.

Figure 14.11 Browser with  variablewrite.html displayed  Chopping up the   heading so that it is placed before and after the script is a bit cumber-  some. We can combine strings using the plus  +  symbol. You’ll see later in this chapter that the  plus symbol can also be used to add numbers. The practice of combining strings using the plus  symbol is called concatenation . Let’s concatenate the   information as a string with the  userName value and the   tag.  Edit the variablewrite.html document as follows:            JavaScript Practice             Using JavaScript      <!--  var userName;  userName = "Karen";     -->           document.write " Hello " + userName + " " ;  Be sure to remove the   and   information above and below the script block. Save the   file  as  variablewrite2.html  and  display  it  in  the  browser  window.  You  should  not  see  any difference  in the document in the browser.  558  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  Collecting Variable Values Using a Prompt  To demonstrate the interactive aspect of JavaScript and variables, we can use the  prompt   method to request data from the user and write this data to the web page. For  example, we will build on Hands-On Practice 14.4 and prompt the user for a name rather  than hard code this data in the userName variable.  The prompt   method is a method of the window object. We could use window.prompt   ,  but the window object is assumed, so we can write this simply as prompt   . The prompt    method can provide a message to the user. This method is generally used in conjunction  with a variable so that the incoming data is stored in a variable. The structure is  someVariable = prompt "prompt message" ;  When this command executes, a prompt box pops up that displays the message and an  input box for data entry. The user types in the prompt box, clicks the OK button, and the  data is assigned to the variable. Let’s add this feature to the variablewrite2.html file.  In this Hands-On Practice, you will use the prompt   method to gather data from the user and  Hands-On Practice 14.5  write it to the document.  Edit the variablewrite2.html file as follows:     <!--  var userName;     -->     userName = prompt "Please enter your name" ;  document.write " Hello " + userName + " " ;  Only the userName variable assignment command has changed. The data typed by the user  will be assigned to the variable userName .  Save the file as variablewrite3.html and display it in the browser. The prompt box will appear and   you can type a name in the input box and click the OK button  see Figure 14.12  . The name  should appear in the browser window.  Figure 14.12 The prompt box  is displayed in the browser  when the web page is loaded  14.8 Introduction to Programming Concepts  559  Let’s do a variation on this and allow the user to type a color name. The user’s preference will be  used as the background color of the document. We will use the bgColor property of the docu-  ment object and set it to the user’s color preference. Be sure that an uppercase C is used when  Edit the variablewrite3.html document as follows and save it as changebackground.html:  typing bgColor .     <!--  var userColor;     -->     userColor = prompt "Please type the color name blue or red" ;  document.bgColor = userColor;  We are prompting the user to type the color name “blue” or “red”. You know from your HTML  experience that there are more options for color names. Feel free to experiment!  Save the document and display it in the browser. The prompt box will appear and you can  type a color name and click the OK button. You should notice the background color change  immediately.  14.8  Introduction to Programming Concepts  Until now, we have used the DOM to access properties and methods for the window and  document. We have also used some simple event handlers. There is another aspect of  JavaScript that is more like programming. In this section, we’ll touch on just a small part  of this to get a feel for the power of using programming concepts and build on this later  When working with variables, it is often useful to be able to do some arithmetic. For  instance, you may be creating a web page that calculates the tax on a product. Once  the user has selected a product, you can use JavaScript to calculate the tax and write  the result to the document. Table 14.3 shows a list of arithmetic operators , descriptions,  Table 14.3 Commonly used arithmetic operators  to test input on a form.  Arithmetic Operators  and some examples.  Operator  Description  Example  Value of Quantity  =  Assign   quantity = 10  10  +  16  −  4  x  20     5  560  Addition  quantity = 10 + 6  subtraction  quantity = 10 − 6  multiplication  quantity = 10 x 2  division  quantity = 10   2  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  Programming languages differ greatly in capabilities, but they all have a few things  in common. They all allow the use of variables and have commands for decision  making, command repetition, and reusable code blocks. Decision making would be  used when different outcomes are required, depending on the input or action of  the user. In the next Hands-On Practice, we will prompt the user to enter a number  and write different text on the web page document based on the value entered.  Repetition of commands comes in handy when performing a similar task many times.  For instance, it is tedious to create a select list containing the numbers 1 through 31  for the days of the months. We can use JavaScript to do this with a few lines of code.  Reusable code blocks are handy when you want to refer to a block of code in an  event handler rather than typing many commands in the HTML tag’s event handler.  Because this chapter is meant to be a very brief introduction, it is beyond our scope  to elaborate further. We will touch on decision making and reusable code in the  Hands-On Practice.  Decision Making  As we’ve seen, we can use variables in JavaScript. We may wish to test the value of a  variable and perform different tasks based on the value of the variable. For instance,  perhaps an order form requires that the user enter a quantity greater than 0. We could  test the quantity input box to verify that the number entered is greater than 0. If the  quantity is not greater than 0, we could pop up an alert message that instructs the user  to enter a quantity greater than 0. The if control structure will be  if  condition  {  .  .  .   commands to execute if condition is true  } else {  .  .  .  }  commands to execute if condition is false  Notice that there are two types of grouping symbols used: parentheses and brackets.  The parentheses are placed around the condition and the brackets are used to encapsu-  late a block of commands. The if statement includes a block of commands to execute if  the condition is true and a block of commands to execute if the condition is false. The  brackets are aligned so that you can easily see the opening brackets and closing brack-  ets. It’s very easy to miss a bracket when you’re typing and then you would have to hunt  for the missing bracket. Aligning them makes it much easier to track them visually. As  you are typing JavaScript code, remember that parentheses, brackets, and quotes al-  ways are used in pairs. If a script isn’t working as intended, verify that each of these  items has a “partner.”  If the condition evaluates as true, the first command block will be executed and the else  block will be skipped. If the condition is false, the first command block will be skipped  and the else block will execute.  This overview should give you a sense of how conditions and the if control  structure can be useful. The condition must be something that can be evaluated  as either true or false. We can think of this as a mathematical condition. The  condition will generally make use of an operator. Table 14.4 lists commonly used  comparison operators . The examples in Table 14.4 could be used as conditions in  an if control structure.  14.8 Introduction to Programming Concepts  Table 14.4 Commonly used comparison operators  Sample Values of a Quantity  561  Operator  Description  Example  = =  that Would Result in True  Double equal signs  equivalent ;  quantity = = 10   “is exactly equal to”  Greater than  quantity > 10  11, 12  but not 10   10  >  > =  Greater than or equal to  quantity > = 10  10, 11, 12  <  Less than  quantity < 10  9, 8  but not 10   < =  Less than or equal to  quantity < = 10  10, 9, 8  FAQ What can I do when my JavaScript code doesn’t seem to be working?  You can try the following debugging techniques:  ● Open the Error Console in Firefox  Tools > Web Developer > Error Console  to see if there  are any errors. Common errors include missing a semicolon at the end of a line and typing  errors in commands.  ● Use alert   to print variables to verify the contents. For instance, if you have a variable  named quantity, try alert quantity ; to see what is contained in the variable.  ● Ask a classmate to look at your code. It’s difficult to edit your own code because you tend  to see what you think you wrote rather than what you actually wrote. It’s easier to edit  someone else’s code.  uncover errors.  ● Try to explain your code to a classmate.

Hands-On Practice 14.6  In this Hands-On Practice, you will code the quantity example described earlier. The user will be  prompted for a quantity and must enter a quantity greater than 0. We will assume that the user  will enter a number. If the user enters a value of 0 or a negative number, there will be an error  message displayed. If the user enters a value greater than 0, a message will be displayed  thanking the user for the order. We will use a prompt and will write messages to the document.  Open a text editor and enter the following:            JavaScript Practice          562     Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript   Using JavaScript      <!--  var quantity;  if  quantity <= 0  {  quantity = prompt "Type a quantity greater than 0" ;  document.write " Quantity is not greater than 0. " ;  document.write " Please refresh the web page. " ;  document.write " Thank you for your order! " ;  } else {  }     -->           Save this document as quantityif.html and display it in a browser. If the prompt box does not  appear, remember to check the Error Console for errors. When the prompt box appears, type  the number 0 and click the OK button. You should see the error message you have created in  the browser window  see Figure 14.13  .  on the right shows the result  Figure 14.13 The browser on the left shows the prompt box with input of 0 and the browser  Now, refresh the page and enter a value greater than 0  see Figure 14.14  .

What if we prefer to allow the user to decide when a particular script should  be interpreted or run by the browser? Perhaps we could use an onmouseover event  handler and run the script when the user moves the mouse pointer over a link or  image. Another method, perhaps more intuitive for the user, is to make use of a button  and direct the user to click the button to run the script. The web page visitor doesn’t  need to be aware that a script will run, but can click a button to initiate some sort  of functionality.  Three types of buttons were introduced in Chapter 9 :  ● A submit button,   , is used to submit a form.  ● A reset button,   , is used to clear values entered on a  form.  action related to forms.  ● The third type of button,   , does not have any default  In this section, we will make use of the button,   , and the  onclick event handler to run a script. The onclick event handler can run a single  command or multiple commands. The sample HTML is  <input type="button" value="Click to see a message"  onclick="alert 'Welcome!' ;">  In this sample, the button will display the text “Click to see a message”. When the  user clicks the button, the click event occurs and the onclick event handler executes  the alert 'Welcome!' ; statement. The message box appears. This method is  very effective when there is only one JavaScript statement to execute. It quickly  becomes unmanageable when there are more statements to execute. When that  happens, it makes sense to place all JavaScript statements in a block and somehow  point to the block to execute. If the statement block has a name, we can execute the  block by pointing to the name. In addition to providing a shortcut name, this code  is also easily reused. We can provide a name for a statement block by creating a  A function is a block of JavaScript statements with a specific purpose that can be run  when needed. A function can contain a single statement or a group of statements and  function.  is defined as  function function_name   {  .  .  .  }  JavaScript statements  The function definition starts with the keyword function followed by the name of the  function. The parentheses are required and more advanced functions make use of them.  You can choose a name for the function just like you choose a name for a variable. The   function name should indicate the purpose of the function. The statements are con-  tained within the brackets. The block of statements will execute when you invoke , or  call, the function.  564  }  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  Here’s an example of a function definition:  function showAlerts   {  alert "Please click OK to continue." ;  alert "Please click OK again." ;  alert "Click OK for the last time to continue." ;  The function can be invoked using  showAlerts  ;  Now, we could include the showAlerts   function call in a button as  <input type="button" value="Click to see alerts."  onclick="showAlerts  ;">  When the user clicks the button, the showAlerts   function will be called and the three  alert messages will appear one after the other. Typically, function definitions are placed  in the head section of the HTML document. This loads the function definition code, but  it does not execute or run until it is invoked. This ensures that the function definition is  loaded and ready to use before the function is called.  Hands-On Practice 14.7  In this Hands-On Practice, you will edit the quantityif.html document to move the prompting script into  a function and call it with an onclick event handler. There are a few things to note. The script has  been  moved  into  the  head  section  and  is  included  in  a  function  defi  nition.  The document.write    methods have been changed to alert   methods and the messages have been altered slightly. The  document.write   methods will not work well after the page has already been written, as is the  case in this exercise. Also, there have been some comments added to the end brackets for the if  statement and the function defi nition. These comments can help you keep track of the code blocks  within the script. The indentation of the code blocks also helps to identify which brackets begin and  end various statements. Launch a text editor and edit the quantityif.html fi le as follows:            JavaScript Practice         <!--   function promptQuantity   {  var quantity;  quantity = prompt "Please type a quantity greater than 0" ;  if  quantity <= 0  {  alert "Quantity is not greater than 0." ;  alert "Thank you for entering a quantity greater than 0." ;  } else {  }    end if  14.9 Form Handling  }    end function promptQuantity  565     -->                  Using JavaScript   <input type="button" value="Click to enter quantity"  onclick="promptQuantity  ;">  Save the document as quantityif2.html and display it in a browser. Open the Error Console to  check whether there are typing errors when you run the script.  Click the button to test the script. If the prompt box does not appear, check the Error Console  and correct any errors. Figure 14.15 shows the browser and the prompt box after the button has  been clicked, as well as the resulting alert box. Be sure to test for a value larger than 0 and a  Figure 14.15 The browser on the left shows the prompt box and input; the browser on the right  value of 0 or less.  shows the alert box displayed after the input  Checkpoint 14.3  1. Describe a method that can be used to gather a piece of data such as the user’s age.  2. Write the JavaScript code to display an alert message for users who are under 18 years old  and a different alert message for users who are 18 years or older.   3. What is a function definition?  14.9  Form Handling  As you discovered in Chapter 9 , the data from a web form can be submitted to a  CGI or a server-side script. This data can be added to a database or used for some  other purpose; therefore, it is important that the data submitted by a user is as  accurate as possible. When the user enters information in a form, there is always  566  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  a chance that the information will be incorrect or inaccurate. This is particularly  true when text input boxes are used because the user can easily mistype data.  Often, the form data is checked for invalid data before it is submitted. Form data  validation can be done by the server-side script, but it can also be done client-side,  using JavaScript. Again, this topic is simplified here, but we can get a sense of how  this might be done.  When the user clicks the form’s submit button, the submit event occurs. We can make  use of the onsubmit event handler to call a function that tests form data for validation.  This technique is referred to as form handling . The web developer can validate all form  input, some input, or just one form input. The following list is a selection of some types  of things that might be validated:  ● Required fields such as name and e-mail address  ● A required check box to acknowledge a license agreement  ● A radio button that indicates a method of payment or a delivery option  ● A value entered that is numeric and must be within a particular range  When the user clicks the submit button, the onsubmit event handler invokes a  function that tests all of the appropriate form elements for valid data. Then the  validation function confirms that the data is valid  true  or not valid  false . The form  is submitted to the URL indicated in the form action attribute if the data is valid   true . The form would not be submitted if the data is not valid  false  and some  indication to the user regarding errors would be displayed. The overall structure  of the web page code related to declaring the function and handling the onsubmit  event is  .  .  .  .  .  .  HTML begins the web page  function validateForm   {  JavaScript commands to test form data go here  if form data is valid  return true  else      return false  . HTML continues  }  .  .  .  .  .  .  . form elements go here        . HTML continues  A new concept with regard to functions is indicated here. A function can encapsulate a  group of statements, but it can also send a value back to where it was invoked, or  called. This is referred to as “returning a value” and the JavaScript keyword return is  used in the JavaScript code to indicate the value that will be sent back. Our example will  return a value of true if the data is valid and a value of false if the data does not pass  our validation tests. Notice that the onsubmit event handler also contains the keyword  return . It works like this: If the validateForm    function returns a value of true, the  14.9 Form Handling  567  onsubmit event handler becomes return true and the form is submitted. If the  validateForm    function returns a value of false, the onsubmit event handler becomes  return false and the form is not submitted. Once a function returns a value, it is  finished executing, even if there are more statements in the function.  Hands-On Practice 14.8  In this Hands-On Practice, you will create a form with inputs for name and age, and use  JavaScript  to  validate  the  data  verifydata  in  the  name  fi  eld  and  a  value  for  age  of  18  or greater.  If there is nothing in the name fi eld, an alert message will be displayed that indicates an error.  If the age value entered is less than 18, an alert message will be displayed that indicates an error.  If all data is valid, an alert message will be displayed indicating that the data is valid and the form  Let’s start by creating the form. Open a text editor and type the HTML below. Notice that the  onsubmit form handler is embedded in the   tag and we will add the JavaScript code  later.

Save the file as formvalidation.html and view it in the browser. Figure 14.16 shows the form in  568  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  Figure 14.16 The formvalidation.  html fi le displayed in the browser  Feel free to click the submit button. You will notice that the inputs will be submitted. For the  moment, we have not coded the validateForm   function, so the form simply submits.  Accessing form inputs is a little tricky. The form is a property of the document object. Each form  element is a property of the form object. A property of a form element can be a value. So, the  HTML for accessing the contents of an input box could look something like this:  document.forms[0].inputbox_name.value  The form is identified by forms[0] to indicate which form will be used. An HTML   document can contain multiple forms. Note that there is an s in forms[0] . The first form  is forms[0] . To access the value in the userAge input box, we will need to use  document.forms[0].userAge.value . This is a mouthful, for sure.  Also, notice that the values true and false are not enclosed in quotes. This is important be-  cause true and false are not strings, they are JavaScript reserved words, or keywords, and  represent special values. If you add quotes to them, they become strings and this function will  not work properly.  Let’s start by adding the code to validate the age. Edit the formvalidation.html file to add the fol-  lowing script block in the head section above the   tag:     <!--  function validateForm   {  if  document.forms[0].userAge.value < 18  {  alert  "Age is less than 18. You are not an adult." ;  return false;  }    end if  alert  "Age is valid." ;  return true;  }    end function validateForm     -->     The validateForm    function will check the age in the userAge input box. If it is less than 18, the  alert message will be displayed and a value of false will be returned and the function will finish  executing.  The  onsubmit  event  handler  will  become  return  false  and  the  form  will  not  be submit-  ted. If the value for age is 18 or greater, the statements in the if structure will be skipped and  the alert "Age is valid." ; will execute. After the user clicks the OK button in the alert  message, the statement return true; will execute and the onsubmit event handler will be-  come return true; thus, the form will be submitted. Let’s test this out!   14.9 Form Handling  569  Type a value less than 18 in the userAge input box and click the submit button. If the form sub-  mits right away, there is likely an error in the JavaScript code. If this happens, open the Error  Console and correct the errors indicated. Figure 14.17 shows the input in the Age box and the  alert message displayed after clicking the submit button.  Figure 14.17 The validateform.html fi le  displayed in a browser with input for age that  is less than 18  notice the alert message   Click the OK button and type a value for age that is 18 or greater in the userAge input box.  Click the submit button. Figure 14.18 shows the input in the userAge input box, the alert mes-  sage displayed after the submit button has been clicked, and the resulting web page after the  form has been submitted.  Figure 14.18 The validateform.html fi le displayed in a browser with input for age greater than  or equal to 18  notice the alert message ; the browser on the right shows the resulting web  page after the form is submitted  Now, let’s add another if statement to validate the name. To ensure that something has  been entered in the userName input box, we will test to see if the value of the input box is  empty. The null string  no characters  is represented by two double quotes  “”  or two single  quotes  ‘’  without a space or any other character in between. We can compare the value of  the userName text box to the null string. If the value of the userName box is equal to the null  string, then we know that the user did not enter any information in this box. In our example,  we will be sending only one error message at a time. If the user does not have a name in the  userName box and also does not have an appropriate age in the userAge box, the user  will only see the userName error message displayed. After the user corrects the name and   570  Chapter 14 A Brief Look at JavaScript  resubmits the information, the user will see the userAge error message displayed. This is very  basic form processing, but it gives you an idea of how form handling might be accomplished.  More sophisticated form processing would verify each form field and indicate all errors each  time the form is submitted.  Let’s add the code to validate the userName data. Edit the formvalidation.html file and  modify the following script block. Note that two equal signs represent equivalency in the  if statement. Some students find it helpful to read the two equal signs   ==   as “is exactly  equal to”.  <!--     function validateForm   {  if  document.forms[0].userName.value == ""  {  alert "Name fi eld cannot be empty." ;  if  document.forms[0].userAge.value < 18  {  alert "Age is less than 18. You are not an adult." ;  return false;  }    end if  return false;  }    end if  return true;     -->     alert "Name and age are valid." ;  }    end function validateForm  Save  the  document  and  refresh  it  in  the  browser  window.  Click  the  submit  button  without enter-  ing  data  in  the  Name  or Age  input  boxes.  Figure  14.19  shows  the  alert  message  displayed when  no data has been input and the submit button has been clicked.  Figure 14.19 The validateform.html fi le  displayed in the browser without input   in the Name and Age boxes; the alert  message appears after the form is  submitted  Click the OK button, enter some text in the Name input box, and submit the form again.  Figure 14.20 shows data in the Name input box and the alert message that appears as a  result of validating the age. The age input box does not contain an age and this is interpreted  as a value of 0.  14.9 Form Handling  571  Figure 14.20 The validateform.html fi le  displayed in the browser with input in  the Name box and without input in the  Age box; the alert message appears  after the submit button is clicked  Click the OK button and enter a value for age that is 18 or greater.

However, be aware that some visitors may have JavaScript disabled, may not be able to  see your visual effect, or may be unable to manipulate the mouse. WCAG 2.0 and  Focus on  Accessibility  Section 508 require that your site is functional at a basic level, even if your visitor’s  browser does not support JavaScript. If you use JavaScript to handle mouse events in  your site navigation, you should also provide plain-text navigation that does not require  a mouse and can be easily accessed by a screen reader. If you use JavaScript for form  validation, provide an e-mail address to allow physically challenged visitors to contact  your organization and obtain assistance.  14.11  JavaScript Resources  This chapter has barely scratched the surface regarding the uses of JavaScript in web  development.

You configure images    Chapter 4   and multimedia   Chapter 11   on web pages and provide for  alternative text content.  ● 1.2 Time-Based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media. You don’t  create time-based media in this textbook, but keep this option in mind for the  future if you create animation or use client-side scripting for features such as  interactive slide shows.  ● 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways  for  example, simpler layout  without losing information or structure. In Chapter 2 ,  you use block elements  such as headings, paragraphs, and lists  to create  single-column web pages. You create multicolumn web pages in Chapter 6 and  Chapter 7 . You use HTML tables in Chapter 8 to configure information.  ● 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content, including  separating foreground from background. You are aware of the importance of   good contrast between text and background.  Operable  ● 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard. In  Chapter 2 , you configure hyperlinks to named fragment identifiers on a web  page. The label element is introduced in Chapter 9 .  ● 2.2 Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content. You don’t  create time-based media in this textbook, but keep this option in mind for the  future if you create animation or use client-side scripting for features such as  interactive slide shows.  603  604  Appendix E WCAG 2.0 Quick Reference  ● 2.3 Seizures: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures. Be  careful when you use animation created by others; web pages should not contain  elements that flash more than three times in a one-second period.  ● 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine  where they are. In Chapter 2 , you use block elements  such as headings and lists   to organize web page content. In Chapter 6 , you learn to structure navigation  links within an unordered list. In Chapter 7 , you configure hyperlinks to named  fragment identifiers on a web page.  Understandable  ● 3.1 Readable: Make text content readable and understandable. You explore  techniques used in writing for the Web in Chapter 5 .  ● 3.2 Predictable: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways. The  web pages you create are predictable, with clearly labeled and functioning  ● 3.3 Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes. You learn to use  HTML form controls in Chapter 9 that cause a supporting browser to validate  basic form information and display error messages. Note that client-side scripting  can be used to edit web page forms and provide additional feedback to users.  hyperlinks.

Although your  web host may off er a web-based fi le manager application for client use, a common  method of transferring fi les is to use File Transfer Protocol  FTP . A protocol is a   convention or standard that enables computers to speak to one another. FTP is used to  copy and manage fi les and folders over the Internet. FTP uses two ports to communicate  over a network—one for the data  typically port 20  and one for control commands   typically  port  21 .

Answers  Chapter 1  Checkpoint 1.1  1. The Internet is a public, globally connected network of computer networks. The  Web is a graphical user interface to information stored on computers running  web servers connected to the Internet. The Web is a subset of the Internet.  2. The commercialization and exponential growth of the Internet that began in the  early 1990s was due largely to a convergence of technologies, including the  development of personal computers with graphical operating systems,  widespread availability of Internet connection services, the removal of the  restriction of commercial use on NSFnet, the development of the World Wide  Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, and the development of a graphical browser   called Mosaic  at the NCSA. These events combined to provide the commercial  incentive and an easy way to share and access information in a manner that had  never been experienced.  3. Universal design is a very important concept for web developers because the  websites that they create should be usable by all people. Not only is this the right  thing to do, but in developing websites for the government or for educational  institutions, access to technology  including websites  is mandated by law.  Checkpoint 1.2  1. An example of a web client is a computer running a browser software application  such as Internet Explorer. Typically, the computer is connected to the Internet only  when needed. The web browser software uses HTTP to request web pages and  related resources from a web server. A web server is a computer that is continually  connected to the Internet and that runs some type of web server software  application. It uses the HTTP protocol to receive requests for web pages and  related resources. It responds to these requests and sends the resources.  611  612  Answers  2. In this chapter, several protocols are discussed that use the Internet  but not the Web. E-mail messages are transmitted via the Internet. SMTP   Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  is used to send e-mail messages. POP   Post Office Protocol  and IMAP  Internet Message Access Protocol   can be used to receive e-mail messages. FTP  File Transfer Protocol  can  be used to exchange  send and receive  files with a computer connected  to the Internet.  3. A URL  Uniform Resource Locator  represents the address of a resource that  is available on the Internet. A URL consists of a protocol, a domain name,  and the hierarchical location of the file or resource. An example of a URL is   http:  www.webdevfoundations.net chapter1 index.htm . A domain name locates  an organization or other entity on the Internet and is associated with a unique  numeric IP address. A domain name is part of a URL.

The head section is located between the   and   tags on a web  page. This area is used to contain information that describes the web page,  such as the title of the page that will display in the menu bar of the browser  window. The body section is located between the   and   tags.  This area is used to code text and tags that show directly in the browser’s  display of the web page. The purpose of the body section is to describe the  contents of the web page.  Answers  613  Checkpoint 2.2  1. The heading element is used to display headings and subheadings of  documents. The size of the heading is configured with the particular heading  level used—ranging from 1 to 6.   is the largest heading.   is the  smallest heading. Text contained between heading tags will be displayed in a   bold font and will have a line break above and below.  2. Ordered lists and unordered lists can be used to organize information on a web  page. Unordered lists display a small symbol or bullet in front of each item. Use the    tag to configure an unordered list. By default, ordered lists display a sequence  of numbers in front of each item. Use the   tag to configure an ordered list.  Configure individual items in both ordered and unordered lists using the   tag.  3. The purpose of the blockquote element is to format a long quotation by indenting  a section of text on a web page. Empty space is placed above and below the text  contained in the blockquote element. The text is indented from both the left and  right margins.  Checkpoint 2.3  1. Special characters are used to display items such as quotation marks, greater  than  > , less than   <  , and the copyright symbol   on a web page. These special  characters, sometimes called entity characters, are interpreted by the browser  when the page is rendered.  2. Use an absolute link to display a web page document from a website other than  your own. The http protocol is used in the href value. Example:  3.

Reasons to use CSS on a web page include the following: greater control of  typography and page layout, separation of style from structure, potentially  smaller web page documents, and easier site maintenance.  2. Because visitors may set their browsers to certain colors, it is a good idea when  changing a text or background color to configure both the text color and the  background color properties to provide good contrast between text and background.  3. Embedded styles are coded once in the header section of the web page and  apply to the entire page. This practice is more efficient than using inline styles to  code individual styles on HTML elements.  Checkpoint 3.2  1. Embedded styles can be used to configure the text and color formatting for an  entire web page. Embedded styles are placed in the head section of a web page.  The   tag is used to contain the CSS selectors and properties that  configure the embedded styles.  2. External styles can be used to configure the text and color formatting for some or  all of the pages on a website in one file. This single file can be changed, and all  the web pages associated with it will display the new styles the next time they  are rendered in a browser. External styles are placed in a separate text file that  uses a .css file extension. Web pages use the   tag to indicate that they  are using an external style sheet.  3.

The  CSS background-repeat property configures the way the image is displayed on  3. The browser will display the background color immediately. Then, the browser  will render the background image and repeat the image as specified in the CSS.  The background color will appear in areas not covered by the background image.  Checkpoint 4.3  1. Answers will vary with the site that you choose to review. Suggested solution:  The page reviewed is the home page of a travel soccer league. The URL is  http:  www.alithsa.org . Image links are used for the main navigation of the site.  Each image link contains a rectangle with text and a soccer ball. There is good  contrast between the black text and the background color of either yellow or  green. Yellow background is used to indicate the current page. Because of the alt  attribute values used, this page would not be accessible to a visitor who cannot  see the images. Currently, every graphic has the same value for the alt attribute  “Picture”. To improve accessibility, the alt attribute values on each image tag  should be modified to contain brief descriptive phrases. On the plus side, the   page does display plain text links in the footer section. The images used as  navigation links on this page contribute to the fun, sporty attitude of the site. The  accessibility of the page needs to be improved.  2. The image, map, and area elements work together to create a functioning image  map. The   tag configures the image that will be used for the map and  616  Answers  contains a usemap attribute whose value corresponds to the id value on the    tag associated with the image. The   tag is a container tag and  surrounds one or more   tags. There is one self-contained   tag for  each clickable hotspot on the image map. See the working example on the  textbook website at http:  webdevfoundations.net 6e chapter4.html .  3. False. There is a trade-off between the quality of the image and the file size. The  goal should be to save images that use the smallest file size which provides  acceptable display quality.

The components of the box model, from innermost to outermost, are the content,  padding, border, and margin.  2. Relative positioning allows you to alter the position of an element in relation to  where it would be displayed when normal flow is used. Absolute positioning  allows you to specify by pixels the exact location of an element in a web page.  3. The purpose of the float property is to shift the display of an element to the right  or left side of the container element.  Checkpoint 6.2  1. The page layout is jello.

Configure an id if the style is for a specific element that is  expected to occur only once on a page. Configure a class if the style is expected  to be applied to a variety of different HTML elements.  Checkpoint 6.3   1. The div element is a multipurpose generic element that configures a section or  division of a web page. HTML5 introduces new elements for configuring web page  areas intended to be more specific in their semantic purpose. Depending on the  target audience for a website, it may be appropriate to use new HTML5 elements  instead of div elements to configure page areas for navigation  the nav element ,  logo header  header and hgroup elements , footer  footer element , sidebar   aside element , articles  article element , images charts  figure and figcaption  elements , and page sections  section element . As time goes on and browser  support increases, use of these new HTML5 elements is expected to be the norm.  2.

Checkpoint 7.2  1. Web page areas can be configured specifically for hard copy. For example,  navigation areas can be hidden, page breaks can be configured, and font  typeface can configured in serif fonts. In addition, content useful for a person  with a hard copy—such as a contact phone number or even a map—can be  configured to display and print on the hard copy.  2. A single-column page layout with a small header, key navigation links, content,  and page footer works well for mobile device display. Heading elements and lists  are well suited for mobile web pages. Eliminate content that is not essential for  mobile use. Avoid the use of tables and absolute positioning when configuring  pages for mobile display.  3. False. Although well intended, media="handheld" is not a reliable way to  target mobile devices.

Although either solution would be appropriate, the solution that uses three input  boxes  first name, last name, and e-mail address  is the more flexible solution.  These separate values could be stored in a database by server-side processing,  where they could easily be selected and placed into personalized e-mail  messages. This approach provides the most useful functionality of the collected  information in future manipulations.  Answers  621  2. There are a number of possible solutions for this design question. If the  responses are short and of about equal length, perhaps a group of radio buttons  would be appropriate. If the responses are lengthy or of widely varying lengths,  a select list would be a good choice. Radio button groups can accept only one  response per group. By default, select lists accept only one response. Check  boxes would not be appropriate because they allow more than one response to  be selected.  3. False. In a radio button group, the name attribute is used by the browser to  process separate elements as a group.  Checkpoint 9.2  1. The fieldset element creates a visual border around the elements contained  within the fieldset. The border can help to organize form elements and  increase the usability of the form. The legend element is used to provide  a text description of the area bounded by the fieldset element, further  increasing the usability of the form for visitors using browsers that support  these tags.  2. The accesskey attribute allows a visitor to select an element immediately  by using the keyboard instead of a mouse. This approach improves the   accessibility of the page and can be very helpful to mobility-impaired  visitors. The W3C recommends providing a visual cue of an underlined  letter, bold letter, or message that indicates the hot keys to press to activate  an element.  3. The web designer and client decide which is used: standard submit button,  image button, or button tag. However, it makes sense to use the simplest  possible technology that provides the needed functionality. In most cases,  this is the standard submit button. Visually challenged visitors using a  screen reader will hear that a submit button has been encountered. Submit  buttons automatically invoke the server-side processing configured in the  form tag.  An image button will also automatically invoke the server-side processing  configured for the form and can be more accessible if configured with the alt and  accesskey attributes. Unless there is a very good reason or a very insistent client,  avoid the button element for standard web forms—avoid choosing a complex  solution when a basic submit button can be used.  Checkpoint 9.3  1. A web browser requests web pages and their related files from a web server. The  web server locates the files and sends them to your web browser. Then the web  browser renders the returned files and displays the requested web pages. Server-  side processing is required to save and handle information entered by web page  visitors. The action attribute on a form element specifies the script or program  that the web server should invoke and pass the form data to. The script or  program returns a result  often a web page  that is sent from the web server to  the browser for display.  622  Answers  2. The server-side script developer and the web page designer must work together  to get both parts of the form processing—the front-end web page and the back-  end server-side script—working together. They need to communicate regarding  the method  get or post  to be used by the form and the location of the server-  side script. Because the names of the form elements are often used by the  server-side script as variable names, the form element names are usually  specified at this time.

Answers  623  Checkpoint 10.2  1. A virtual web host that offers reliability and scalability would meet the needs of a  small company for its initial web presence. The web host chosen should offer  higher-end packages with scripting, database, and e-commerce capabilities to  allow for future growth.  2. A dedicated web server is owned and supported by the web host company. The  client company may choose to administer it or may pay the web host company to   perform this task. A co-located server is owned by the client company and  housed at the web host provider. This configuration offers both the advantage of  a reliable Internet connection at the web host and full control of the  administration and support of the web server.  3. If your website is down and your web host is not responding to technical support  requests, it doesn’t matter that you are saving $5.00 per month.

Website promotion methods that do not use search engines  include the following: affiliate programs, banner ads, banner exchanges,  reciprocal link agreements, newsletters, sticky site features such as polls, forums,  surveys, QR codes, personal recommendations, newsgroup listserv postings,  social media marketing techniques, blog postings, RSS feeds, traditional media  ads, and existing paper marketing materials. Any of these are valid as a first  choice—depending on the needs of the organization. The newsletter technique is  an interesting promotion method. Place a form on a web page to allow visitors to  opt into your newsletter. Send them a periodic e-mail with information of value  related to your site  possibly even special offers . This approach encourages  visitors to return to your site. They may even forward your e-mail to a friend.  Note: Be sure to provide a way for visitors to opt out of the newsletter.

Form data validation refers to checking form input against validation rules and  not allowing the form to be submitted if the data does not conform to the rules.  2. Answers may vary, but may include required fields such as name, e-mail address,  and phone number. Numeric fields may require validation to ensure that they are  within particular bounds—for example, order quantity greater than 0 and age  between 1 and 120.  3. When the user clicks the submit button, the submit event occurs and the onsubmit  event handler executes the return validateForm   command. The validateForm  function runs and tests the form data for validation. If the data is valid,  validateForm   returns the value of true, and the form is submitted. If the data is  not valid, validateForm   returns the value of false and the form is not submitted.  Review Questions  Answers  1. a  4. a  2. c  5. d  3. b  6. c  629  7. a  8. b  9. c  17.
