You may even be a little weary of people pontificating about this fact.  Analysts are often trained to handle tabular or rectangular data that is mostly numeric, but much of the data proliferating today is unstructured and text-heavy. Many of us who work in analytical fields are not trained in even simple interpretation of natural language. We  developed  the  tidytext   Silge  and  Robinson  2016   R  package  because  we  were familiar with many methods for data wrangling and visualization, but couldn’t easily apply these same methods to text. We found that using tidy data principles can make many  text  mining  tasks  easier,  more  effective,  and  consistent  with  tools  already  in wide use. Treating text as data frames of individual words allows us to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text easily, and integrate natural lan‐ guage processing into effective workflows we were already using. This book serves as an introduction to text mining using the tidytext package and other tidy tools in R. The functions provided by the tidytext package are relatively simple;  what  is  important  are  the  possible  applications.  Thus,  this  book  provides compelling examples of real text mining problems. Outline We start by introducing the tidy text format, and some of the ways dplyr, tidyr, and tidytext allow informative analyses of this structure:    Chapter 1 outlines the tidy text format and the unnest_tokens   function. It also introduces the gutenbergr and janeaustenr packages, which provide useful liter‐ ary text datasets that we’ll use throughout this book.    Chapter 2 shows how to perform sentiment analysis on a tidy text dataset using  the sentiments dataset from tidytext and inner_join   from dplyr.     Chapter 3 describes the tf-idf statistic  term frequency times inverse document frequency , a quantity used for identifying terms that are especially important to a particular document.    Chapter 4 introduces n-grams and how to analyze word networks in text using  the widyr and ggraph packages.  Text won’t be tidy at all stages of an analysis, and it is important to be able to convert back and forth between tidy and nontidy formats:    Chapter 5 introduces methods for tidying document-term matrices and Corpus objects from the tm and quanteda packages, as well as for casting tidy text data‐ sets into those formats.    Chapter 6 explores the concept of topic modeling, and uses the tidy   method  to interpret and visualize the output of the topicmodels package.  We conclude with several case studies that bring together multiple tidy text mining approaches we’ve learned:    Chapter  7  demonstrates  an  application  of  a  tidy  text  analysis  by  analyzing  the authors’  own  Twitter  archives.  How  do  Dave’s  and  Julia’s  tweeting  habits  com‐ pare?    Chapter  8  explores  metadata  from  over  32,000  NASA  datasets   available  in JSON  by looking at how keywords from the datasets are connected to title and description fields.    Chapter 9 analyzes a dataset of Usenet messages from a diverse set of newsgroups  focused on topics like politics, hockey, technology, atheism, and more  to under‐ stand patterns across the groups.  Topics This Book Does Not Cover This book serves as an introduction to the tidy text mining framework, along with a collection of examples, but it is far from a complete exploration of natural language processing. The CRAN Task View on Natural Language Processing provides details on other ways to use R for computational linguistics. There are several areas that you may want to explore in more detail according to your needs: Clustering, classification, and prediction  Machine learning on text is a vast topic that could easily fill its own volume. We introduce one method of unsupervised clustering  topic modeling  in Chapter 6, but many more machine learning algorithms can be used in dealing with text.   Word embedding  One popular modern approach for text analysis is to map words to vector repre‐ sentations, which can then be used to examine linguistic relationships between words and to classify text. Such representations of words are not tidy in the sense that we consider here, but have found powerful applications in machine learning algorithms.  More complex tokenization  The  tidytext  package  trusts  the  tokenizers  package   Mullen  2016   to  perform tokenization, which itself wraps a variety of tokenizers with a consistent interface, but many others exist for specific applications.  Languages other than English  Some of our users have had success applying tidytext to their text mining needs for languages other than English, but we don’t cover any such examples in this book.  About This Book This book is focused on practical software examples and data explorations. There are few equations, but a great deal of code. We especially focus on generating real insights from the literature, news, and social media that we analyze. We don’t assume any previous knowledge of text mining. Professional linguists and text analysts will likely find our examples elementary, though we are confident they can build on the framework for their own analyses. We assume that the reader is at least slightly familiar with dplyr, ggplot2, and the %>% “pipe” operator in R, and is interested in applying these tools to text data. For users who don’t have this background, we recommend books such as R for Data Science by Hadley  Wickham  and  Garrett  Grolemund   O’Reilly .  We  believe  that  with  a  basic background  and  interest  in  tidy  data,  even  a  user  early  in  his  or  her  R  career  can understand and apply our examples.

CHAPTER 1 The Tidy Text Format  Using tidy data principles is a powerful way to make handling data easier and more effective, and this is no less true when it comes to dealing with text. As described by Hadley Wickham  Wickham 2014 , tidy data has a specific structure:    Each variable is a column.   Each observation is a row.   Each type of observational unit is a table.  We thus define the tidy text format as being a table with one token per row. A token is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word, that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens. This one-token-per-row structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored in current analyses, perhaps as strings or in a document-term matrix. For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or para‐ graph.  In  the  tidytext  package,  we  provide  functionality  to  tokenize  by  commonly used units of text like these and convert to a one-term-per-row format. Tidy data sets allow manipulation with a standard set of “tidy” tools, including popu‐ lar  packages  such  as  dplyr   Wickham  and  Francois  2016 ,  tidyr   Wickham  2016 , ggplot2  Wickham 2009 , and broom  Robinson 2017 . By keeping the input and out‐ put in tidy tables, users can transition fluidly between these packages. We’ve found these tidy tools extend naturally to many text analyses and explorations. At the same time, the tidytext package doesn’t expect a user to keep text data in a tidy form at all times during an analysis. The package includes functions to tidy   objects  see the broom package [Robinson, cited above]  from popular text mining R pack‐ ages such as tm  Feinerer et al. 2008  and quanteda  Benoit and Nulty 2016 . This allows, for example, a workflow where importing, filtering, and processing is done  1   using dplyr and other tidy tools, after which the data is converted into a document- term matrix for machine learning applications. The models can then be reconverted into a tidy form for interpretation and visualization with ggplot2. Contrasting Tidy Text with Other Data Structures As we stated above, we define the tidy text format as being a table with one token per row. Structuring text data in this way means that it conforms to tidy data principles and can be manipulated with a set of consistent tools. This is worth contrasting with the ways text is often stored in text mining approaches: String  Text  can,  of  course,  be  stored  as  strings   i.e.,  character  vectors   within  R,  and often text data is first read into memory in this form.  Corpus  These  types  of  objects  typically  contain  raw  strings  annotated  with  additional metadata and details.  Document-term matrix  This is a sparse matrix describing a collection  i.e., a corpus  of documents with one  row  for  each  document  and  one  column  for  each  term.  The  value  in  the matrix is typically word count or tf-idf  see Chapter 3 .  Let’s hold off on exploring corpus and document-term matrix objects until Chapter 5, and get down to the basics of converting text to a tidy format. The unnest_tokens Function Emily Dickinson wrote some lovely text in her time. text <- c "Because I could not stop for Death -",           "He kindly stopped for me -",           "The Carriage held but just Ourselves -",           "and Immortality"    [1] "Because I could not stop for Death -"   "He kindly stopped for me -"  [3] "The Carriage held but just Ourselves -" "and Immortality"  This is a typical character vector that we might want to analyze. In order to turn it into a tidy text dataset, we first need to put it into a data frame.  library dplyr  text_df <- data_frame line = 1:4, text = text   text  text_df  2      Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format     A tibble: 4 × 2     line                                   text                                          1     1   Because I could not stop for Death -  2     2             He kindly stopped for me -  3     3 The Carriage held but just Ourselves -  4     4                        and Immortality  What  does  it  mean  that  this  data  frame  has  printed  out  as  a  “tibble”?  A  tibble  is  a modern class of data frame within R, available in the dplyr and tibble packages, that has a convenient print method, will not convert strings to factors, and does not use row names. Tibbles are great for use with tidy tools. Notice that this data frame containing text isn’t yet compatible with tidy text analysis. We  can’t  filter  out  words  or  count  which  occur  most  frequently,  since  each  row  is made up of multiple combined words. We need to convert this so that it has one token per document per row.  A token is a meaningful unit of text, most often a word, that we are interested in using for further analysis, and tokenization is the pro‐ cess of splitting text into tokens.  In  this  first  example,  we  only  have  one  document   the  poem ,  but  we  will  explore examples with multiple documents soon. Within our tidy text framework, we need to both break the text into individual tokens  a process called tokenization  and transform it to a tidy data structure. To do this, we use the tidytext unnest_tokens   function.  library tidytext   text_df %>%   unnest_tokens word, text     A tibble: 20 × 2      line    word            1      1 because  2      1       i  3      1   could  4      1     not  5      1    stop  6      1     for  7      1   death  8      2      he  9      2  kindly  10     2 stopped   ... with 10 more rows  The unnest_tokens Function      3   The two basic arguments to  unnest_tokens used here are column names. First we have the output column name that will be created as the text is unnested into it  word, in this case , and then the input column that the text comes from  text, in this case . Remember  that  text_df  above  has  a  column  called  text  that  contains  the  data  of interest. After using unnest_tokens, we’ve split each row so that there is one token  word  in each row of the new data frame; the default tokenization in unnest_tokens   is for single words, as shown here. Also notice:    Other columns, such as the line number each word came from, are retained.   Punctuation has been stripped.   By  default,  unnest_tokens    converts  the  tokens  to  lowercase,  which  makes them  easier  to  compare  or  combine  with  other  datasets.   Use  the  to_lower  = FALSE argument to turn off this behavior .  Having the text data in this format lets us manipulate, process, and visualize the text using  the  standard  set  of  tidy  tools,  namely  dplyr,  tidyr,  and  ggplot2,  as  shown  in Figure 1-1.  Figure 1-1. A flowchart of a typical text analysis using tidy data principles. This chapter shows how to summarize and visualize text using these tools. Tidying the Works of Jane Austen Let’s use the text of Jane Austen’s six completed, published novels from the janeaus‐ tenr package  Silge 2016 , and transform them into a tidy format. The janeaustenr package provides these texts in a one-row-per-line format, where a line in this con‐ text is analogous to a literal printed line in a physical book. Let’s start with that, and also  use  mutate    to  annotate  a  linenumber  quantity  to  keep  track  of  lines  in  the original format, and a chapter  using a regex  to find where all the chapters are.  library janeaustenr  library dplyr  library stringr   original_books  %   group_by book  %>%  4      Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format     mutate linenumber = row_number  ,          chapter = cumsum str_detect text, regex "^chapter [\\divxlc]",                                                  ignore_case = TRUE     %>%   ungroup    original_books    A tibble: 73,422 × 4                      text                book linenumber chapter                                                  1  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY Sense & Sensibility          1       0  2                        Sense & Sensibility          2       0  3         by Jane Austen Sense & Sensibility          3       0  4                        Sense & Sensibility          4       0  5                  1811  Sense & Sensibility          5       0  6                        Sense & Sensibility          6       0  7                        Sense & Sensibility          7       0  8                        Sense & Sensibility          8       0  9                        Sense & Sensibility          9       0  10             CHAPTER 1 Sense & Sensibility         10       1   ... with 73,412 more rows  To work with this as a tidy dataset, we need to restructure it in the one-token-per-row format, which as we saw earlier is done with the unnest_tokens   function.  library tidytext  tidy_books  %   unnest_tokens word, text   tidy_books    A tibble: 725,054 × 4                    book linenumber chapter        word                                        1  Sense & Sensibility          1       0       sense  2  Sense & Sensibility          1       0         and  3  Sense & Sensibility          1       0 sensibility  4  Sense & Sensibility          3       0          by  5  Sense & Sensibility          3       0        jane  6  Sense & Sensibility          3       0      austen  7  Sense & Sensibility          5       0        1811  8  Sense & Sensibility         10       1     chapter  9  Sense & Sensibility         10       1           1  10 Sense & Sensibility         13       1         the   ... with 725,044 more rows  This function uses the tokenizers package to separate each line of text in the original data frame into tokens. The default tokenizing is for words, but other options include characters, n-grams, sentences, lines, paragraphs, or separation around a regex pat‐ tern. Now  that  the  data  is  in  one-word-per-row  format,  we  can  manipulate  it  with  tidy tools like dplyr. Often in text analysis, we will want to remove stop words, which are  Tidying the Works of Jane Austen      5   words that are not useful for an analysis, typically extremely common words such as “the,” “of,” “to,” and so forth in English. We can remove stop words  kept in the tidy‐ text dataset stop_words  with an anti_join  .  The stop_words dataset in the tidytext package contains stop words from three lexi‐ cons. We can use them all together, as we have here, or filter   to only use one set of stop words if that is more appropriate for a certain analysis. We can also use dplyr’s count   to find the most common words in all the books as a whole.  data stop_words   tidy_books  %   anti_join stop_words   tidy_books %>%   count word, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 13,914 × 2       word     n           1    miss  1855  2    time  1337  3   fanny   862  4    dear   822  5    lady   817  6     sir   806  7     day   797  8    emma   787  9  sister   727  10  house   699   ... with 13,904 more rows  library ggplot2   tidy_books %>%   count word, sort = TRUE  %>%   filter n > 600  %>%   mutate word = reorder word, n   %>%   ggplot aes word, n   +   geom_col   +   xlab NULL  +   coord_flip    6      Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format  Because we’ve been using tidy tools, our word counts are stored in a tidy data frame. This allows us to pipe directly to the ggplot2 package, for example to create a visuali‐ zation of the most common words  Figure 1-2 .   Figure 1-2. The most common words in Jane Austen’s novels  Note that the austen_books   function started us with exactly the text we wanted to analyze,  but  in  other  cases  we  may  need  to  perform  cleaning  of  text  data,  such  as removing copyright headers or formatting. You’ll see examples of this kind of pre- processing in the case study chapters, particularly “Preprocessing” on page 153. The gutenbergr Package Now that we’ve used the janeaustenr package to explore tidying text, let’s introduce the gutenbergr package  Robinson 2016 . The gutenbergr package provides access to the  public  domain  works  from  the  Project  Gutenberg  collection.  The  package includes tools both for downloading books  stripping out the unhelpful header footer information , and a complete dataset of Project Gutenberg metadata that can be used to find works of interest. In this book, we will mostly use the gutenberg_download   function that downloads one or more works from Project Gutenberg by ID, but you can also use other functions to explore metadata, pair Gutenberg ID with title, author, language, and so on, or gather information about authors.  The gutenbergr Package      7   To learn more about gutenbergr, check out the package’s tutorial at rOpenSci, where it is one of rOpenSci’s packages for data access.  Word Frequencies A common task in text mining is to look at word frequencies, just like we have done above for Jane Austen’s novels, and to compare frequencies across different texts. We can do this intuitively and smoothly using tidy data principles. We already have Jane Austen’s works; let’s get two more sets of texts to compare to. First, let’s look at some science fiction and fantasy novels by H.G. Wells, who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Let’s get The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, and The Island of Doctor Moreau. We can access these works using gutenberg_down load   and the Project Gutenberg ID numbers for each novel.  library gutenbergr   hgwells <- gutenberg_download c 35, 36, 5230, 159    tidy_hgwells  %   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   anti_join stop_words   Just for kicks, what are the most common words in these novels of H.G. Wells?  tidy_hgwells %>%   count word, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 11,769 × 2       word     n           1    time   454  2  people   302  3    door   260  4   heard   249  5   black   232  6   stood   229  7   white   222  8    hand   218  9    kemp   213  10   eyes   210   ... with 11,759 more rows  Now let’s get some well-known works of the Brontë sisters, whose lives overlapped with Jane Austen’s somewhat, but who wrote in a rather different style. Let’s get Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Villette, and Agnes Grey. We will again use the Project Gutenberg ID numbers for each novel and access the texts using gutenberg_download  .  8      Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format   bronte <- gutenberg_download c 1260, 768, 969, 9182, 767    What are the most common words in these novels of the Brontë sisters?  tidy_bronte  %   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   anti_join stop_words   tidy_bronte %>%   count word, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 23,051 × 2       word     n           1    time  1065  2    miss   855  3     day   827  4    hand   768  5    eyes   713  6   night   647  7   heart   638  8  looked   602  9    door   592  10   half   586   ... with 23,041 more rows  Interesting that “time,” “eyes,” and “hand” are in the top 10 for both H.G. Wells and the Brontë sisters. Now,  let’s  calculate  the  frequency  for  each  word  in  the  works  of  Jane  Austen,  the Brontë  sisters,  and  H.G.  Wells  by  binding  the  data  frames  together.  We  can  use spread and  gather from tidyr to reshape our data frame so that it is just what we need for plotting and comparing the three sets of novels.  library tidyr   frequency <- bind_rows mutate tidy_bronte, author = "Brontë Sisters" ,                        mutate tidy_hgwells, author = "H.G. Wells" ,                        mutate tidy_books, author = "Jane Austen"   %>%   mutate word = str_extract word, "[a-z']+"   %>%   count author, word  %>%   group_by author  %>%   mutate proportion = n   sum n   %>%   select -n  %>%   spread author, proportion  %>%   gather author, proportion, `Brontë Sisters`:`H.G. Wells`   We use  str_extract   here because the UTF-8 encoded texts from Project Guten‐ berg have some examples of words with underscores around them to indicate empha‐ sis   like  italics .  The  tokenizer  treated  these  as  words,  but  we  don’t  want  to  count “any” separately from “any” as we saw in our initial data exploration before choosing to use str_extract  .  Word Frequencies      9   Now let’s plot  Figure 1-3 .  library scales    expect a warning about rows with missing values being removed ggplot frequency, aes x = proportion, y = `Jane Austen`,                       color = abs `Jane Austen` - proportion    +   geom_abline color = "gray40", lty = 2  +   geom_jitter alpha = 0.1, size = 2.5, width = 0.3, height = 0.3  +   geom_text aes label = word , check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5  +   scale_x_log10 labels = percent_format    +   scale_y_log10 labels = percent_format    +   scale_color_gradient limits = c 0, 0.001 ,                        low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75"  +   facet_wrap ~author, ncol = 2  +   theme legend.position="none"  +   labs y = "Jane Austen", x = NULL   Figure 1-3. Comparing the word frequencies of Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, and H.G. Wells  Words that are close to the line in these plots have similar frequencies in both sets of texts, for example, in both Austen and Brontë texts  “miss,” “time,” and “day” at the high frequency end  or in both Austen and Wells texts  “time,” “day,” and “brother” at the high frequency end . Words that are far from the line are words that are found more  in  one  set  of  texts  than  another.  For  example,  in  the  Austen-Brontë  panel, words like “elizabeth,” “emma,” and “fanny”  all proper nouns  are found in Austen’s texts but not much in the Brontë texts, while words like “arthur” and “dog” are found in the Brontë texts but not the Austen texts. In comparing H.G. Wells with Jane Aus‐  10      Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format   ten,  Wells  uses  words  like  “beast,”  “guns,”  “feet,”  and  “black”  that  Austen  does  not, while Austen uses words like “family”, “friend,” “letter,” and “dear” that Wells does not. Overall, notice in Figure 1-3 that the words in the Austen-Brontë panel are closer to the zero-slope line than in the Austen-Wells panel. Also notice that the words extend to lower frequencies in the Austen-Brontë panel; there is empty space in the Austen- Wells  panel  at  low  frequency.  These  characteristics  indicate  that  Austen  and  the Brontë sisters use more similar words than Austen and H.G. Wells. Also, we see that not all the words are found in all three sets of texts, and there are fewer data points in the panel for Austen and H.G. Wells. Let’s quantify how similar and different these sets of word frequencies are using a cor‐ relation test. How correlated are the word frequencies between Austen and the Brontë sisters, and between Austen and Wells?  cor.test data = frequency[frequency$author == "Brontë Sisters",],          ~ proportion + `Jane Austen`      Pearson's product-moment correlation   data:  proportion and Jane Austen  t = 119.64, df = 10404, p-value < 2.2e-16  alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0  95 percent confidence interval:   0.7527837 0.7689611  sample estimates:        cor  0.7609907  cor.test data = frequency[frequency$author == "H.G.

Wells.  Word Frequencies      11   Summary In this chapter, we explored what we mean by tidy data when it comes to text, and how tidy data principles can be applied to natural language processing. When text is organized in a format with one token per row, tasks like removing stop words or cal‐ culating word frequencies are natural applications of familiar operations within the tidy tool ecosystem. The one-token-per-row framework can be extended from single words to n-grams and other meaningful units of text, as well as to many other analy‐ sis priorities that we will consider in this book.  12      Chapter 1: The Tidy Text Format   CHAPTER 2 Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data  In the previous chapter, we explored in depth what we mean by the tidy text format and  showed  how  this  format  can  be  used  to  approach  questions  about  word  fre‐ quency. This allowed us to analyze which words are used most frequently in docu‐ ments  and  to  compare  documents,  but  now  let’s  investigate  a  different  topic.  Let’s address  the  topic  of  opinion  mining  or  sentiment  analysis.  When  human  readers approach a text, we use our understanding of the emotional intent of words to infer whether  a  section  of  text  is  positive  or  negative,  or  perhaps  characterized  by  some other more nuanced emotion like surprise or disgust. We can use the tools of text mining  to  approach  the  emotional  content  of  text  programmatically,  as  shown  in Figure 2-1.  Figure 2-1. A flowchart of a typical text analysis that uses tidytext for sentiment analy‐ sis. This chapter shows how to implement sentiment analysis using tidy data principles.  One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as a combination of its individual words, and the sentiment content of the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words. This isn’t the only way to approach senti‐  13   ment analysis, but it is an often-used approach, and an approach that naturally takes advantage of the tidy tool ecosystem. The sentiments Dataset As discussed above, there are a variety of methods and dictionaries that exist for eval‐ uating opinion or emotion in text. The tidytext package contains several sentiment lexicons in the sentiments dataset.  library tidytext   sentiments    A tibble: 27,314 × 4            word sentiment lexicon score                          1       abacus     trust     nrc    NA  2      abandon      fear     nrc    NA  3      abandon  negative     nrc    NA  4      abandon   sadness     nrc    NA  5    abandoned     anger     nrc    NA  6    abandoned      fear     nrc    NA  7    abandoned  negative     nrc    NA  8    abandoned   sadness     nrc    NA  9  abandonment     anger     nrc    NA  10 abandonment      fear     nrc    NA   ... with 27,304 more rows  The three general-purpose lexicons are:    AFINN from Finn Årup Nielsen   Bing from Bing Liu and collaborators   NRC from Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney  All three lexicons are based on unigrams, i.e., single words. These lexicons contain many  English  words  and  the  words  are  assigned  scores  for  positive negative  senti‐ ment, and also possibly emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and so forth. The NRC lexi‐ con  categorizes  words  in  a  binary  fashion   “yes” “no”   into  categories  of  positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The Bing lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories.  The AFINN lexicon assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with neg‐ ative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sen‐ timent. All of this information is tabulated in the  sentiments dataset, and tidytext provides the function  get_sentiments   to get specific sentiment lexicons without the columns that are not used in that lexicon.  14      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   get_sentiments "afinn"     A tibble: 2,476 × 2           word score               1     abandon    -2  2   abandoned    -2  3    abandons    -2  4    abducted    -2  5   abduction    -2  6  abductions    -2  7       abhor    -3  8    abhorred    -3  9   abhorrent    -3  10     abhors    -3   ... with 2,466 more rows  get_sentiments "bing"     A tibble: 6,788 × 2            word sentiment                    1      2-faced  negative  2      2-faces  negative  3           a+  positive  4     abnormal  negative  5      abolish  negative  6   abominable  negative  7   abominably  negative  8    abominate  negative  9  abomination  negative  10       abort  negative   ... with 6,778 more rows  get_sentiments "nrc"     A tibble: 13,901 × 2            word sentiment                    1       abacus     trust  2      abandon      fear  3      abandon  negative  4      abandon   sadness  5    abandoned     anger  6    abandoned      fear  7    abandoned  negative  8    abandoned   sadness  9  abandonment     anger  10 abandonment      fear   ... with 13,891 more rows  How were these sentiment lexicons put together and validated? They were construc‐ ted via either crowdsourcing  using, for example, Amazon Mechanical Turk  or by the  labor  of  one  of  the  authors,  and  were  validated  using  some  combination  of  The sentiments Dataset      15   crowdsourcing again, restaurant or movie reviews, or Twitter data. Given this infor‐ mation, we may hesitate to apply these sentiment lexicons to styles of text dramati‐ cally different from what they were validated on, such as narrative fiction from 200 years ago. While it is true that using these sentiment lexicons with, for example, Jane Austen’s novels may give us less accurate results than with tweets sent by a contempo‐ rary  writer,  we  still  can  measure  the  sentiment  content  for  words  that  are  shared across the lexicon and the text. There are also some domain-specific sentiment lexicons available, constructed to be used with text from a specific content area. “Example: Mining Financial Articles” on page 81 explores an analysis using a sentiment lexicon specifically for finance.  Dictionary-based methods like the ones we are discussing find the total sentiment of a piece of text by adding up the individual senti‐ ment scores for each word in the text.  Not every English word is in the lexicons because many English words are pretty neu‐ tral.  It  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  these  methods  do  not  take  into  account  qualifiers before a word, such as in “no good” or “not true”; a lexicon-based method like this is based on unigrams only. For many kinds of text  like the narrative exam‐ ples below , there are no sustained sections of sarcasm or negated text, so this is not an  important  effect.  Also,  we  can  use  a  tidy  text  approach  to  begin  to  understand what  kinds  of  negation  words  are  important  in  a  given  text;  see  Chapter  9  for  an extended example of such an analysis. One last caveat is that the size of the chunk of text that we use to add up unigram sentiment scores can have an effect on an analysis. A text the size of many paragraphs can  often  have  positive  and  negative  sentiment  averaging  out  to  about  zero,  while sentence-sized or paragraph-sized text often works better. Sentiment Analysis with Inner Join With data in a tidy format, sentiment analysis can be done as an inner join. This is another of the great successes of viewing text mining as a tidy data analysis task— much as removing stop words is an anti-join operation, performing sentiment analy‐ sis is an inner join operation. Let’s look at the words with a joy score from the NRC lexicon. What are the most common joy words in Emma? First, we need to take the text of the novel and convert the  text  to  the  tidy  format  using  unnest_tokens  ,  just  as  we  did  in  “Tidying  the Works of Jane Austen” on page 4. Let’s also set up some other columns to keep track  16      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   of which line and chapter of the book each word comes from; we use group_by and mutate to construct those columns.  library janeaustenr  library dplyr  library stringr   tidy_books  %   group_by book  %>%   mutate linenumber = row_number  ,          chapter = cumsum str_detect text, regex "^chapter [\\divxlc]",                                                  ignore_case = TRUE     %>%   ungroup   %>%   unnest_tokens word, text   Notice that we chose the name word for the output column from unnest_tokens  . This  is  a  convenient  choice  because  the  sentiment  lexicons  and  stop-word  datasets have columns named word; performing inner joins and anti-joins is thus easier. Now that the text is in a tidy format with one word per row, we are ready to do the sentiment analysis. First, let’s use the NRC lexicon and  filter   for the joy words. Next, let’s  filter   the data frame with the text from the book for the words from Emma and then use  inner_join   to perform the sentiment analysis. What are the most common joy words in Emma? Let’s use count   from dplyr.  nrcjoy  %   filter sentiment == "joy"   tidy_books %>%   filter book == "Emma"  %>%   inner_join nrcjoy  %>%   count word, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 303 × 2        word     n            1     good   359  2    young   192  3   friend   166  4     hope   143  5    happy   125  6     love   117  7     deal    92  8    found    92  9  present    89  10    kind    82   ... with 293 more rows  We see many positive, happy words about hope, friendship, and love here.  Sentiment Analysis with Inner Join      17   Or instead we could examine how sentiment changes throughout each novel. We can do this with just a handful of lines that are mostly dplyr functions. First, we find a sentiment score for each word using the Bing lexicon and inner_join  . Next, we count up how many positive and negative words there are in defined sec‐ tions of each book. We define an index here to keep track of where we are in the nar‐ rative; this index  using integer division  counts up sections of 80 lines of text.  The  % % operator does integer division  x  % %  y is equivalent to floor x y   so the index keeps track of which 80-line section of text we are counting up negative and positive sentiment in.  Small sections of text may not have enough words in them to get a good estimate of sentiment,  while  really  large  sections  can  wash  out  narrative  structure.  For  these books,  using  80  lines  works  well,  but  this  can  vary  depending  on  individual  texts, how long the lines were to start with, etc. We then use spread   so that we have nega‐ tive and positive sentiment in separate columns, and lastly calculate a net sentiment  positive - negative .  library tidyr   janeaustensentiment  %   inner_join get_sentiments "bing"   %>%   count book, index = linenumber % % 80, sentiment  %>%   spread sentiment, n, fill = 0  %>%   mutate sentiment = positive - negative   Now  we  can  plot  these  sentiment  scores  across  the  plot  trajectory  of  each  novel. Notice that we are plotting against the index on the x-axis that keeps track of narra‐ tive time in sections of text  Figure 2-2 .  library ggplot2   ggplot janeaustensentiment, aes index, sentiment, fill = book   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x"   18      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   Figure 2-2. Sentiment through the narratives of Jane Austen’s novels  We can see in Figure 2-2 how the plot of each novel changes toward more positive or negative sentiment over the trajectory of the story. Comparing the Three Sentiment Dictionaries With several options for sentiment lexicons, you might want some more information on which one is appropriate for your purposes. Let’s use all three sentiment lexicons and examine how the sentiment changes across the narrative arc of Pride and Preju‐  Comparing the Three Sentiment Dictionaries      19   dice.  First,  let’s  use  filter    to  choose  only  the  words  from  the  one  novel  we  are interested in.  pride_prejudice  %   filter book == "Pride & Prejudice"   pride_prejudice    A tibble: 122,204 × 4                  book linenumber chapter      word                                    1  Pride & Prejudice          1       0     pride  2  Pride & Prejudice          1       0       and  3  Pride & Prejudice          1       0 prejudice  4  Pride & Prejudice          3       0        by  5  Pride & Prejudice          3       0      jane  6  Pride & Prejudice          3       0    austen  7  Pride & Prejudice          7       1   chapter  8  Pride & Prejudice          7       1         1  9  Pride & Prejudice         10       1        it  10 Pride & Prejudice         10       1        is   ... with 122,194 more rows  Now, we can use inner_join   to calculate the sentiment in different ways.  Remember  from  above  that  the  AFINN  lexicon  measures  senti‐ ment with a numeric score between -5 and 5, while the other two lexicons  categorize  words  in  a  binary  fashion,  either  positive  or negative.  To  find  a  sentiment  score  in  chunks  of  text  throughout the  novel,  we  will  need  to  use  a  different  pattern  for  the  AFINN lexicon than for the other two.  Let’s again use integer division  % %  to define larger sections of text that span multi‐ ple lines, and we can use the same pattern with count  , spread  , and mutate   to find the net sentiment in each of these sections of text.  afinn  %   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn"   %>%   group_by index = linenumber % % 80  %>%   summarise sentiment = sum score   %>%   mutate method = "AFINN"   bing_and_nrc <- bind_rows    pride_prejudice %>%     inner_join get_sentiments "bing"   %>%     mutate method = "Bing et al." ,   pride_prejudice %>%     inner_join get_sentiments "nrc"  %>%                  filter sentiment %in% c "positive",                                          "negative"    %>%     mutate method = "NRC"   %>%  20      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data     count method, index = linenumber % % 80, sentiment  %>%   spread sentiment, n, fill = 0  %>%   mutate sentiment = positive - negative   We now have an estimate of the net sentiment  positive - negative  in each chunk of the novel text for each sentiment lexicon. Let’s bind them together and visualize them in Figure 2-3. bind_rows afinn,           bing_and_nrc  %>%   ggplot aes index, sentiment, fill = method   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~method, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y"   Figure 2-3. Comparing three sentiment lexicons using Pride and Prejudice  The three different lexicons for calculating sentiment give results that are different in an absolute sense but have similar relative trajectories through the novel. We see sim‐ ilar dips and peaks in sentiment at about the same places in the novel, but the abso‐ lute values are significantly different. The AFINN lexicon gives the largest absolute values, with high positive values. The lexicon from Bing et al. has lower absolute val‐  Comparing the Three Sentiment Dictionaries      21   ues and seems to label larger blocks of contiguous positive or negative text. The NRC results are shifted higher relative to the other two, labeling the text more positively, but detects similar relative changes in the text. We find similar differences between the methods when looking at other novels; the NRC sentiment is high, the AFINN sentiment  has  more  variance,  and  the  Bing  et  al.  sentiment  appears  to  find  longer stretches of similar text, but all three agree roughly on the overall trends in the senti‐ ment through a narrative arc. Why is, for example, the result for the NRC lexicon biased so high in sentiment com‐ pared to the Bing et al. result? Let’s look briefly at how many positive and negative words are in these lexicons.  get_sentiments "nrc"  %>%      filter sentiment %in% c "positive",                              "negative"   %>%   count sentiment     A tibble: 2 × 2    sentiment     n             1  negative  3324  2  positive  2312  get_sentiments "bing"  %>%   count sentiment     A tibble: 2 × 2    sentiment     n             1  negative  4782  2  positive  2006  Both  lexicons  have  more  negative  than  positive  words,  but  the  ratio  of  negative  to positive words is higher in the Bing lexicon than the NRC lexicon. This will contrib‐ ute to the effect we see in the plot above, as will any systematic difference in word matches, for example, if the negative words in the NRC lexicon do not match very well with the words that Jane Austen uses. Whatever the source of these differences, we  see  similar  relative  trajectories  across  the  narrative  arc,  with  similar  changes  in slope, but marked differences in absolute sentiment from lexicon to lexicon. This is important context to keep in mind when choosing a sentiment lexicon for analysis. Most Common Positive and Negative Words One advantage of having the data frame with both sentiment and word is that we can analyze  word  counts  that  contribute  to  each  sentiment.  By  implementing  count   here with arguments of both word and sentiment, we find out how much each word contributed to each sentiment.  22      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   bing_word_counts  %   inner_join get_sentiments "bing"   %>%   count word, sentiment, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    bing_word_counts    A tibble: 2,585 × 3         word sentiment     n                   1      miss  negative  1855  2      well  positive  1523  3      good  positive  1380  4     great  positive   981  5      like  positive   725  6    better  positive   639  7    enough  positive   613  8     happy  positive   534  9      love  positive   495  10 pleasure  positive   462   ... with 2,575 more rows  bing_word_counts %>%   group_by sentiment  %>%   top_n 10  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = reorder word, n   %>%   ggplot aes word, n, fill = sentiment   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~sentiment, scales = "free_y"  +   labs y = "Contribution to sentiment",        x = NULL  +   coord_flip    This can be shown visually, and we can pipe straight into ggplot2, if we like, because of  the  way  we  are  consistently  using  tools  built  for  handling  tidy  data  frames  Figure 2-4 .  Most Common Positive and Negative Words      23   Figure 2-4. Words that contribute to positive and negative sentiment in Jane Austen’s novels  Figure 2-4 lets us spot an anomaly in the sentiment analysis; the word “miss” is coded as  negative  but  it  is  used  as  a  title  for  young,  unmarried  women  in  Jane  Austen’s works. If it were appropriate for our purposes, we could easily add “miss” to a custom stop-words list using bind_rows  . We could implement that with a strategy such as this:  custom_stop_words <- bind_rows data_frame word = c "miss" ,                                           lexicon = c "custom"  ,                                stop_words   custom_stop_words    A tibble: 1,150 × 2            word lexicon                  1         miss  custom  2            a   SMART  3          a's   SMART  4         able   SMART  5        about   SMART  6        above   SMART  7    according   SMART  8  accordingly   SMART  9       across   SMART  10    actually   SMART   ... with 1,140 more rows  24      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   Wordclouds We’ve seen that this tidy text mining approach works well with ggplot2, but having our data in a tidy format is useful for other plots as well. For example, consider the wordcloud package, which uses base R graphics. Let’s look at the most common words in Jane Austen’s works as a whole again, but this time as a wordcloud in Figure 2-5.  library wordcloud   tidy_books %>%   anti_join stop_words  %>%   count word  %>%   with wordcloud word, n, max.words = 100    Figure 2-5. The most common words in Jane Austen’s novels  In  other  functions,  such  as  comparison.cloud  ,  you  may  need  to  turn  the  data frame into a matrix with reshape2’s  acast  . Let’s do the sentiment analysis to tag positive and negative words using an inner join, then find the most common positive and  negative  words.  Until  the  step  where  we  need  to  send  the  data  to  compari  Wordclouds      25   son.cloud  , this can all be done with joins, piping, and dplyr because our data is in tidy format  Figure 2-6 .  library reshape2   tidy_books %>%   inner_join get_sentiments "bing"   %>%   count word, sentiment, sort = TRUE  %>%   acast word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0  %>%   comparison.cloud colors = c "gray20", "gray80" ,                    max.words = 100   Figure 2-6. Most common positive and negative words in Jane Austen’s novels  26      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   The size of a word’s text in Figure 2-6 is in proportion to its frequency within its sen‐ timent. We can use this visualization to see the most important positive and negative words, but the sizes of the words are not comparable across sentiments. Looking at Units Beyond Just Words Lots of useful work can be done by tokenizing at the word level, but sometimes it is useful  or  necessary  to  look  at  different  units  of  text.  For  example,  some  sentiment analysis algorithms look beyond only unigrams  i.e., single words  to try to under‐ stand the sentiment of a sentence as a whole. These algorithms try to understand that “I am not having a good day” is a sad sentence, not a happy one, because of negation. R packages including coreNLP  Arnold and Tilton 2016 , cleanNLP  Arnold 2016 , and  sentimentr   Rinker  2017   are  examples  of  such  sentiment  analysis  algorithms. For these, we may want to tokenize text into sentences, and it makes sense to use a new name for the output column in such a case.  PandP_sentences  %   unnest_tokens sentence, text, token = "sentences"   Let’s look at just one.  PandP_sentences$sentence[2]   [1] "however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."  The sentence tokenizing does seem to have a bit of trouble with UTF-8 encoded text, especially with sections of dialogue; it does much better with punctuation in ASCII. One  possibility,  if  this  is  important,  is  to  try  using  iconv    with  something  like iconv text, to = 'latin1'  in a mutate statement before unnesting. Another option in unnest_tokens   is to split into tokens using a regex pattern. We could use this, for example, to split the text of Jane Austen’s novels into a data frame by chapter.  austen_chapters  %   group_by book  %>%   unnest_tokens chapter, text, token = "regex",                 pattern = "ChapterCHAPTER [\\dIVXLC]"  %>%   ungroup    austen_chapters %>%   group_by book  %>%   summarise chapters = n       A tibble: 6 × 2                   book chapters                         Looking at Units Beyond Just Words      27    1 Sense & Sensibility       51  2   Pride & Prejudice       62  3      Mansfield Park       49  4                Emma       56  5    Northanger Abbey       32  6          Persuasion       25  We have recovered the correct number of chapters in each novel  plus an “extra” row for each novel title . In the  austen_chapters data frame, each row corresponds to one chapter. Near the beginning of this chapter, we used a similar regex to find where all the chap‐ ters were in Austen’s novels for a tidy data frame organized by one word per row. We can use tidy text analysis to ask questions such as what are the most negative chapters in each of Jane Austen’s novels? First, let’s get the list of negative words from the Bing lexicon. Second, let’s make a data frame of how many words are in each chapter so we can normalize for chapter length. Then, let’s find the number of negative words in each  chapter  and  divide  by  the  total  words  in  each  chapter.  For  each  book,  which chapter has the highest proportion of negative words?  bingnegative  %   filter sentiment == "negative"   wordcounts  %   group_by book, chapter  %>%   summarize words = n     tidy_books %>%   semi_join bingnegative  %>%   group_by book, chapter  %>%   summarize negativewords = n    %>%   left_join wordcounts, by = c "book", "chapter"   %>%   mutate ratio = negativewords words  %>%   filter chapter != 0  %>%   top_n 1  %>%   ungroup      A tibble: 6 × 5                   book chapter negativewords words      ratio                                           1 Sense & Sensibility      43           161  3405 0.04728341  2   Pride & Prejudice      34           111  2104 0.05275665  3      Mansfield Park      46           173  3685 0.04694708  4                Emma      15           151  3340 0.04520958  5    Northanger Abbey      21           149  2982 0.04996647  6          Persuasion       4            62  1807 0.03431101  These are the chapters with the most sad words in each book, normalized for number of words in the chapter. What is happening in these chapters? In Chapter 43 of Sense and Sensibility, Marianne is seriously ill, near death; and in Chapter 34 of Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy proposes for the first time  so badly! . Chapter 46 of Mansfield  28      Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data   Park is almost the end, when everyone learns of Henry’s scandalous adultery; Chapter 15 of Emma is when horrifying Mr. Elton proposes; and in Chapter 21 of Northanger Abbey, Catherine is deep in her Gothic faux fantasy of murder. Chapter 4 of Persua‐ sion is when the reader gets the full flashback of Anne refusing Captain Wentworth, how sad she was, and what a terrible mistake she realized it to be. Summary Sentiment analysis provides a way to understand the attitudes and opinions expressed in texts. In this chapter, we explored how to approach sentiment analysis using tidy data principles; when text data is in a tidy data structure, sentiment analysis can be implemented as an inner join. We can use sentiment analysis to understand how a narrative arc changes throughout its course or what words with emotional and opin‐ ion content are important for a particular text. We will continue to develop our tool‐ box for applying sentiment analysis to different kinds of text in our case studies later in this book.  Summary      29   CHAPTER 3 Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf  A central question in text mining and natural language processing is how to quantify what a document is about. Can we do this by looking at the words that make up the document? One measure of how important a word may be is its term frequency  tf , how frequently a word occurs in a document, as we examined in Chapter 1. There are words in a document, however, that occur many times but may not be important; in English, these are probably words like “the,” “is,” “of,” and so forth. We might take the approach of adding words like these to a list of stop words and removing them before analysis, but it is possible that some of these words might be more important in some documents than others. A list of stop words is not a very sophisticated approach to adjusting term frequency for commonly used words. Another  approach  is  to  look  at  a  term’s  inverse  document  frequency   idf ,  which decreases the weight for commonly used words and increases the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection of documents. This can be combined with term frequency to calculate a term’s tf-idf  the two quantities multiplied together , the frequency of a term adjusted for how rarely it is used.  The statistic tf-idf is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection  or corpus  of documents, for exam‐ ple, to one novel in a collection of novels or to one website in a col‐ lection of websites.  The statistic tf-idf is a rule of thumb or heuristic quantity; while it has proved useful in  text  mining,  search  engines,  etc.,  its  theoretical  foundations  are  considered  less than  firm  by  information  theory  experts.  The  inverse  document  frequency  for  any given term is defined as:  31   id f term = ln  ndocuments  ndocuments containing term  We can use tidy data principles, as described in Chapter 1, to approach tf-idf analysis and use consistent, effective tools to quantify how important various terms are in a document that is part of a collection. Term Frequency in Jane Austen’s Novels Let’s start by looking at the published novels of Jane Austen and first examine term frequency, then tf-idf. We can start just by using dplyr verbs such as group_by   and join  . What are the most commonly used words in Jane Austen’s novels?  Let’s also calculate the total words in each novel here, for later use.   library dplyr  library janeaustenr  library tidytext   book_words  %   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   count book, word, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    total_words  %   group_by book  %>%   summarize total = sum n    book_words <- left_join book_words, total_words   book_words    A tibble: 40,379 × 4                  book  word     n  total                          1     Mansfield Park   the  6206 160460  2     Mansfield Park    to  5475 160460  3     Mansfield Park   and  5438 160460  4               Emma    to  5239 160996  5               Emma   the  5201 160996  6               Emma   and  4896 160996  7     Mansfield Park    of  4778 160460  8  Pride & Prejudice   the  4331 122204  9               Emma    of  4291 160996  10 Pride & Prejudice    to  4162 122204   ... with 40,369 more rows  There is one row in this book_words data frame for each word-book combination; n is the number of times that word is used in that book, and total is the total number of words in that book. The usual suspects are here with the highest n, “the,” “and,” “to,”  32      Chapter 3: Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf   and so forth. In Figure 3-1, let’s look at the distribution of n total for each novel: the number  of  times  a  word  appears  in  a  novel  divided  by  the  total  number  of  terms  words  in that novel. This is exactly what term frequency is.  library ggplot2   ggplot book_words, aes n total, fill = book   +   geom_histogram show.legend = FALSE  +   xlim NA, 0.0009  +   facet_wrap ~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y"   Figure 3-1. Term frequency distribution in Jane Austen’s novels  There  are  very  long  tails  to  the  right  for  these  novels   those  extremely  common words!  that we have not shown in these plots. These plots exhibit similar distribu‐  Term Frequency in Jane Austen’s Novels      33   tions for all the novels, with many words that occur rarely and fewer words that occur frequently. Zipf’s Law Distributions  like  those  shown  in  Figure  3-1  are  typical  in  language.  In  fact,  those types of long-tailed distributions are so common in any given corpus of natural lan‐ guage  like a book, or a lot of text from a website, or spoken words  that the relation‐ ship between the frequency that a word is used and its rank has been the subject of study. A classic version of this relationship is called Zipf’s law, after George Zipf, a 20th-century American linguist.  Zipf’s law states that the frequency that a word appears is inversely proportional to its rank.  Since we have the data frame we used to plot term frequency, we can examine Zipf’s law for Jane Austen’s novels with just a few lines of dplyr functions.  freq_by_rank  %   group_by book  %>%   mutate rank = row_number  ,          `term frequency` = n total   freq_by_rank   Source: local data frame [40,379 x 6]  Groups: book [6]                   book  word     n  total  rank `term frequency`                                         1     Mansfield Park   the  6206 160460     1       0.03867631  2     Mansfield Park    to  5475 160460     2       0.03412065  3     Mansfield Park   and  5438 160460     3       0.03389007  4               Emma    to  5239 160996     1       0.03254118  5               Emma   the  5201 160996     2       0.03230515  6               Emma   and  4896 160996     3       0.03041069  7     Mansfield Park    of  4778 160460     4       0.02977689  8  Pride & Prejudice   the  4331 122204     1       0.03544074  9               Emma    of  4291 160996     4       0.02665284  10 Pride & Prejudice    to  4162 122204     2       0.03405780   ... with 40,369 more rows  The rank column here tells us the rank of each word within the frequency table; the table was already ordered by n, so we could use row_number   to find the rank. Then, we can calculate the term frequency in the same way we did before. Zipf’s law is often visualized by plotting rank on the x-axis and term frequency on the y-axis, on loga‐  34      Chapter 3: Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf   rithmic  scales.  Plotting  this  way,  an  inversely  proportional  relationship  will  have  a constant, negative slope  Figure 3-2 .  freq_by_rank %>%   ggplot aes rank, `term frequency`, color = book   +   geom_line size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE  +   scale_x_log10   +   scale_y_log10    Figure 3-2. Zipf’s law for Jane Austen’s novels  Notice that Figure 3-2 is in log-log coordinates. We see that all six of Jane Austen’s novels  are  similar  to  each  other,  and  that  the  relationship  between  rank  and  fre‐ quency does have negative slope. It is not quite constant, though; perhaps we could view this as a broken power law with, say, three sections. Let’s see what the exponent of the power law is for the middle section of the rank range.  rank_subset  %   filter rank < 500,          rank > 10   lm log10 `term frequency`  ~ log10 rank , data = rank_subset   Zipf’s Law      35     Call:  lm formula = log10 `term frequency`  ~ log10 rank , data = rank_subset    Coefficients:   Intercept   log10 rank       -0.6225      -1.1125  Classic  versions  of  Zipf’s  law  have  frequency ∝ 1 rank  and  we  have  in  fact  gotten  a slope close to –1 here. Let’s plot this fitted power law with the data in Figure 3-3 to see how it looks.  freq_by_rank %>%   ggplot aes rank, `term frequency`, color = book   +   geom_abline intercept = -0.62, slope = -1.1, color = "gray50", linetype = 2  +   geom_line size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE  +   scale_x_log10   +   scale_y_log10    Figure 3-3. Fitting an exponent for Zipf’s law with Jane Austen’s novels  36      Chapter 3: Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf   We have found a result close to the classic version of Zipf’s law for the corpus of Jane Austen’s novels. The deviations we see here at high rank are not uncommon for many kinds of language; a corpus of language often contains fewer rare words than predic‐ ted by a single power law. The deviations at low rank are more unusual. Jane Austen uses a lower percentage of the most common words than many collections of lan‐ guage. This kind of analysis could be extended to compare authors, or to compare any other collections of text; it can be implemented simply using tidy data principles. The bind_tf_idf Function The idea of tf-idf is to find the important words for the content of each document by decreasing the weight for commonly used words and increasing the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection or corpus of documents, in this case, the group of Jane Austen’s novels as a whole. Calculating tf-idf attempts to find the words that are important  i.e., common  in a text, but not too common. Let’s do that now. The  bind_tf_idf function in the tidytext package takes a tidy text dataset as input with one row per token  term , per document. One column  word here  contains the terms tokens, one column contains the documents  book in this case , and the last necessary column contains the counts, or how many times each document contains each term  n in this example . We calculated a total for each book for our explora‐ tions in previous sections, but it is not necessary for the  bind_tf_idf function; the table only needs to contain all the words in each document.  book_words  %   bind_tf_idf word, book, n  book_words    A tibble: 40,379 × 7                  book  word     n  total         tf   idf tf_idf                                      1     Mansfield Park   the  6206 160460 0.03867631     0      0  2     Mansfield Park    to  5475 160460 0.03412065     0      0  3     Mansfield Park   and  5438 160460 0.03389007     0      0  4               Emma    to  5239 160996 0.03254118     0      0  5               Emma   the  5201 160996 0.03230515     0      0  6               Emma   and  4896 160996 0.03041069     0      0  7     Mansfield Park    of  4778 160460 0.02977689     0      0  8  Pride & Prejudice   the  4331 122204 0.03544074     0      0  9               Emma    of  4291 160996 0.02665284     0      0  10 Pride & Prejudice    to  4162 122204 0.03405780     0      0   ... with 40,369 more rows  Notice that idf and thus tf-idf are zero for these extremely common words. These are all words that appear in all six of Jane Austen’s novels, so the idf term  which will then be the natural log of 1  is zero. The inverse document frequency  and thus tf-idf  is very low  near zero  for words that occur in many of the documents in a collection;  The bind_tf_idf Function      37   this is how this approach decreases the weight for common words. The inverse docu‐ ment frequency will be a higher number for words that occur in fewer of the docu‐ ments in the collection. Let’s look at terms with high tf-idf in Jane Austen’s works.  book_words %>%   select -total  %>%   arrange desc tf_idf      A tibble: 40,379 × 6                    book      word     n          tf      idf      tf_idf                                                  1  Sense & Sensibility    elinor   623 0.005193528 1.791759 0.009305552  2  Sense & Sensibility  marianne   492 0.004101470 1.791759 0.007348847  3       Mansfield Park  crawford   493 0.003072417 1.791759 0.005505032  4    Pride & Prejudice     darcy   373 0.003052273 1.791759 0.005468939  5           Persuasion    elliot   254 0.003036207 1.791759 0.005440153  6                 Emma      emma   786 0.004882109 1.098612 0.005363545  7     Northanger Abbey    tilney   196 0.002519928 1.791759 0.004515105  8                 Emma    weston   389 0.002416209 1.791759 0.004329266  9    Pride & Prejudice    bennet   294 0.002405813 1.791759 0.004310639  10          Persuasion wentworth   191 0.002283132 1.791759 0.004090824   ... with 40,369 more rows  Here we see all proper nouns, names that are in fact important in these novels. None of them occur in all of the novels, and they are important, characteristic words for each text within the corpus of Jane Austen’s novels.  Some of the values for idf are the same for different terms because there  are  six  documents  in  this  corpus  and  we  are  seeing  the numerical value for ln 6 1 , ln 6 2 , etc.  Let’s look at a visualization for these high tf-idf words in Figure 3-4.  book_words %>%   arrange desc tf_idf   %>%   mutate word = factor word, levels = rev unique word     %>%   group_by book  %>%   top_n 15  %>%   ungroup %>%   ggplot aes word, tf_idf, fill = book   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   labs x = NULL, y = "tf-idf"  +   facet_wrap ~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free"  +   coord_flip    38      Chapter 3: Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf   Figure 3-4. Highest tf-idf words in each of Jane Austen’s novels  Still all proper nouns in Figure 3-4! These words are, as measured by tf-idf, the most important to each novel and most readers would likely agree. What measuring tf-idf has done here is show us that Jane Austen used similar language across her six novels, and what distinguishes one novel from the rest within the collection of her works are the proper nouns, the names of people and places. This is the point of tf-idf; it identi‐ fies words that are important to one document within a collection of documents.  The bind_tf_idf Function      39   A Corpus of Physics Texts Let’s work with another corpus of documents to see what terms are important in a different set of works. In fact, let’s leave the world of fiction and narrative entirely. Let’s download some classic physics texts from Project Gutenberg and see what terms are  important  in  these  works,  as  measured  by  tf-idf.  Let’s  download  Discourse  on Floating Bodies  by  Galileo  Galilei, Treatise on Light  by  Christiaan  Huygens, Experi‐ ments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency by Nikola Tesla, and Relativity: The Special and General Theory by Albert Einstein. This is a pretty diverse bunch. They may all be physics classics, but they were written across a 300-year time span, and some of them were first written in other languages and then translated to English. Perfectly homogeneous these are not, but that doesn’t stop this from being an interesting exercise!  library gutenbergr  physics <- gutenberg_download c 37729, 14725, 13476, 5001 ,                               meta_fields = "author"   Now that we have the texts, let’s use unnest_tokens   and count   to find out how many times each word is used in each text.  physics_words  %   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   count author, word, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    physics_words    A tibble: 12,592 × 3                  author  word     n                          1     Galilei, Galileo   the  3760  2        Tesla, Nikola   the  3604  3  Huygens, Christiaan   the  3553  4     Einstein, Albert   the  2994  5     Galilei, Galileo    of  2049  6     Einstein, Albert    of  2030  7        Tesla, Nikola    of  1737  8  Huygens, Christiaan    of  1708  9  Huygens, Christiaan    to  1207  10       Tesla, Nikola     a  1176   ... with 12,582 more rows  Here we see just the raw counts; we need to remember that these documents are all different  lengths.

Notice that we make a custom list of stop words and use anti_join   to remove them; this is a flexible approach that can be used in many situations.

Highest tf-idf words in classic physics texts  One thing we can conclude from Figure 3-6 is that we don’t hear enough about ram‐ parts or things being ethereal in physics today. Summary Using term frequency and inverse document frequency allows us to find words that are characteristic for one document within a collection of documents, whether that document is a novel or physics text or webpage. Exploring term frequency on its own can give us insight into how language is used in a collection of natural language, and dplyr verbs like  count   and  rank   give us tools to reason about term frequency. The tidytext package uses an implementation of tf-idf consistent with tidy data prin‐ ciples that enables us to see how different words are important in documents within a collection or corpus of documents.  44      Chapter 3: Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf   CHAPTER 4 Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations  So far we’ve considered words as individual units, and considered their relationships to sentiments or to documents. However, many interesting text analyses are based on the relationships between words, whether examining which words tend to follow oth‐ ers immediately, or words that tend to co-occur within the same documents. In this chapter, we’ll explore some of the methods tidytext offers for calculating and visualizing relationships between words in your text dataset. This includes the token =  "ngrams"  argument,  which  tokenizes  by  pairs  of  adjacent  words  rather  than  by individual ones. We’ll also introduce two new packages: ggraph, by Thomas Pedersen, which extends ggplot2 to construct network plots, and widyr, which calculates pair‐ wise correlations and distances within a tidy data frame. Together these expand our toolbox for exploring text within the tidy data framework. Tokenizing by N-gram We’ve been using the unnest_tokens function to tokenize by word, or sometimes by sentence,  which  is  useful  for  the  kinds  of  sentiment  and  frequency  analyses  we’ve been  doing  so  far.  But  we  can  also  use  the  function  to  tokenize  into  consecutive sequences of words, called n-grams. By seeing how often word X is followed by word Y, we can then build a model of the relationships between them. We do this by adding the token = "ngrams" option to unnest_tokens  , and setting n to the number of words we wish to capture in each n-gram. When we set n to 2, we are examining pairs of two consecutive words, often called “bigrams”:  library dplyr  library tidytext   45   library janeaustenr   austen_bigrams  %   unnest_tokens bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2   austen_bigrams    A tibble: 725,048 × 2                    book          bigram                                 1  Sense & Sensibility       sense and  2  Sense & Sensibility and sensibility  3  Sense & Sensibility  sensibility by  4  Sense & Sensibility         by jane  5  Sense & Sensibility     jane austen  6  Sense & Sensibility     austen 1811  7  Sense & Sensibility    1811 chapter  8  Sense & Sensibility       chapter 1  9  Sense & Sensibility           1 the  10 Sense & Sensibility      the family   ... with 725,038 more rows  This data structure is still a variation of the tidy text format. It is structured as one token  per  row   with  extra  metadata,  such  as  book,  still  preserved ,  but  each  token now represents a bigram.  Notice that these bigrams overlap: “sense and” is one token, while “and sensibility” is another.  Counting and Filtering N-grams Our usual tidy tools apply equally well to n-gram analysis. We can examine the most common bigrams using dplyr’s count  :  austen_bigrams %>%   count bigram, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 211,237 × 2       bigram     n             1    of the  3017  2     to be  2787  3    in the  2368  4    it was  1781  5      i am  1545  6   she had  1472  7    of her  1445  8    to the  1387  9   she was  1377  46      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations    10 had been  1299   ... with 211,227 more rows  As one might expect, a lot of the most common bigrams are pairs of common  unin‐ teresting  words, such as “of the” and “to be,” what we call “stop words”  see Chap‐ ter  1 .  This  is  a  useful  time  to  use  tidyr’s  separate  ,  which  splits  a  column  into multiple  columns  based  on  a  delimiter.  This  lets  us  separate  it  into  two  columns, “word1”  and  “word2,”  at  which  point  we  can  remove  cases  where  either  is  a  stop word.  library tidyr   bigrams_separated  %   separate bigram, c "word1", "word2" , sep = " "   bigrams_filtered  %   filter !word1 %in% stop_words$word  %>%   filter !word2 %in% stop_words$word    new bigram counts: bigram_counts  %   count word1, word2, sort = TRUE   bigram_counts   Source: local data frame [33,421 x 3]  Groups: word1 [6,711]        word1     word2     n                  1      sir    thomas   287  2     miss  crawford   215  3  captain wentworth   170  4     miss woodhouse   162  5    frank churchill   132  6     lady   russell   118  7     lady   bertram   114  8      sir    walter   113  9     miss   fairfax   109  10 colonel   brandon   108   ... with 33,411 more rows  We can see that names  whether first and last or with a salutation  are the most com‐ mon pairs in Jane Austen books. In other analyses, we may want to work with the recombined words. tidyr’s unite   function is the inverse of  separate  , and lets us recombine the columns into one. Thus,  “separate filter count unite”  let  us  find  the  most  common  bigrams  not containing stop words.  bigrams_united  %   unite bigram, word1, word2, sep = " "   Tokenizing by N-gram      47   bigrams_united    A tibble: 44,784 × 2                    book                   bigram  *                                       1  Sense & Sensibility              jane austen  2  Sense & Sensibility              austen 1811  3  Sense & Sensibility             1811 chapter  4  Sense & Sensibility                chapter 1  5  Sense & Sensibility             norland park  6  Sense & Sensibility surrounding acquaintance  7  Sense & Sensibility               late owner  8  Sense & Sensibility             advanced age  9  Sense & Sensibility       constant companion  10 Sense & Sensibility             happened ten   ... with 44,774 more rows  In  other  analyses  you  may  be  interested  in  the  most  common  trigrams,  which  are consecutive sequences of three words.

The 12 bigrams with the highest tf-idf from each Jane Austen novel  Much as we discovered in Chapter 3, the units that distinguish each Austen book are almost  exclusively  names.  We  also  notice  some  pairings  of  a  common  verb  and  a name, such as “replied elizabeth” in Pride and Prejudice, or “cried emma” in Emma. There  are  advantages  and  disadvantages  to  examining  the  tf-idf  of  bigrams  rather than individual words. Pairs of consecutive words might capture structure that isn’t present when one is just counting single words, and may provide context that makes tokens more understandable  for example, “pulteney street,” in Northanger Abbey, is more informative than “pulteney” . However, the per-bigram counts are also sparser: a typical two-word pair is rarer than either of its component words. Thus, bigrams can be especially useful when you have a very large text dataset.  50      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations   Using Bigrams to Provide Context in Sentiment Analysis Our sentiment analysis approch in Chapter 2 simply counted the appearance of posi‐ tive or negative words, according to a reference lexicon. One of the problems with this approach is that a word’s context can matter nearly as much as its presence. For example, the words “happy” and “like” will be counted as positive, even in a sentence like “I’m not happy and I don’t like it!” Now that we have the data organized into bigrams, it’s easy to tell how often words are preceded by a word like “not.”  bigrams_separated %>%   filter word1 == "not"  %>%   count word1, word2, sort = TRUE    Source: local data frame [1,246 x 3]  Groups: word1 [1]      word1 word2     n            1    not    be   610  2    not    to   355  3    not  have   327  4    not  know   252  5    not     a   189  6    not think   176  7    not  been   160  8    not   the   147  9    not    at   129  10   not    in   118   ... with 1,236 more rows  AFINN    A tibble: 2,476 × 2           word score               1     abandon    -2  2   abandoned    -2  3    abandons    -2  4    abducted    -2  5   abduction    -2  By  performing  sentiment  analysis  on  the  bigram  data,  we  can  examine  how  often sentiment-associated words are preceded by “not” or other negating words. We could use this to ignore or even reverse their contribution to the sentiment score. Let’s  use  the  AFINN  lexicon  for  sentiment  analysis,  which  you  may  recall  gives  a numeric sentiment score for each word, with positive or negative numbers indicating the direction of the sentiment.  AFINN <- get_sentiments "afinn"   Tokenizing by N-gram      51   We can then examine the most frequent words that were preceded by “not” and were associated with a sentiment.  not_words  %   filter word1 == "not"  %>%   inner_join AFINN, by = c word2 = "word"   %>%   count word2, score, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup     6  abductions    -2  7       abhor    -3  8    abhorred    -3  9   abhorrent    -3  10     abhors    -3   ... with 2,466 more rows  not_words    A tibble: 245 × 3       word2 score     n              1     like     2    99  2     help     2    82  3     want     1    45  4     wish     1    39  5    allow     1    36  6     care     2    23  7    sorry    -1    21  8    leave    -1    18  9  pretend    -1    18  10   worth     2    17   ... with 235 more rows  For example, the most common sentiment-associated word to follow “not” was “like,” which would normally have a  positive  score of 2. It’s  worth  asking  which  words  contributed  the  most  in  the  “wrong”  direction.  To compute that, we can multiply their score by the number of times they appear  so that a word with a score of +3 occurring 10 times has as much impact as a word with a sentiment  score  of  +1  occurring  30  times .  We  visualize  the  result  with  a  bar  plot  Figure 4-2 .  not_words %>%   mutate contribution = n * score  %>%   arrange desc abs contribution    %>%   head 20  %>%   mutate word2 = reorder word2, contribution   %>%   ggplot aes word2, n * score, fill = n * score > 0   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   xlab "Words preceded by \"not\""  +   ylab "Sentiment score * number of occurrences"  +   coord_flip    52      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations   Figure 4-2. The 20 words followed by “not” that had the greatest contribution to senti‐ ment scores, in either a positive or negative direction  The bigrams “not like” and “not help” were overwhelmingly the largest causes of mis‐ identification, making the text seem much more positive than it is. But we can see that phrases like “not afraid” and “not fail” sometimes suggest text is more negative than it is. “Not” isn’t the only term that provides some context for the following word. We could pick  four  common  words   or  more   that  negate  the  subsequent  term,  and  use  the same joining and counting approach to examine all of them at once.  negation_words <- c "not", "no", "never", "without"   negated_words  %   filter word1 %in% negation_words  %>%   inner_join AFINN, by = c word2 = "word"   %>%   count word1, word2, score, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    We could then visualize what the most common words to follow each particular neg‐ ation are  Figure 4-3 . While “not like” and “not help” are still the two most common examples, we can also see pairings such as “no great” and “never loved.” We could  Tokenizing by N-gram      53   combine this with the approaches in Chapter 2 to reverse the AFINN scores of each word that follows a negation. These are just a few examples of how finding consecu‐ tive words can give context to text mining methods.  Figure 4-3. The most common positive or negative words to follow negations such as “never,” “no,” “not,” and “without” Visualizing a Network of Bigrams with ggraph We may be interested in visualizing all of the relationships among words simultane‐ ously, rather than just the top few at a time. As one common visualization, we can arrange the words into a network, or “graph.” Here we’ll be referring to a graph not in the sense of a visualization, but as a combination of connected nodes. A graph can be constructed from a tidy object since it has three variables:  54      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations   The node an edge is coming from  The node an edge is going toward  from  to  weight  A numeric value associated with each edge  The  igraph  package  has  many  powerful  functions  for  manipulating  and  analyzing networks.

We recommend the ggraph package  Pedersen 2017 , because it implements these vis‐ ualizations in terms of the grammar of graphics, which we are already familiar with from ggplot2. We can convert an igraph object into a ggraph with the ggraph function, after which we add layers to it, much like layers are added in ggplot2. For example, for a basic graph we need to add three layers: nodes, edges, and text  Figure 4-4 .  library ggraph  set.seed 2017   ggraph bigram_graph, layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link   +   geom_node_point   +   geom_node_text aes label = name , vjust = 1, hjust = 1   Figure 4-4. Common bigrams in Pride and Prejudice, showing those that occurred more than 20 times and where neither word was a stop word  56      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations   In Figure 4-4, we can visualize some details of the text structure. For example, we see that  salutations  such  as  “miss,”  “lady,”  “sir,”  and  “colonel”  form  common  centers  of nodes, which are often followed by names. We also see pairs or triplets along the out‐ side  that  form  common  short  phrases   “half  hour,''  “thousand  pounds,”  or  “short time pause” . We  conclude  with  a  few  polishing  operations  to  make  a  better-looking  graph  Figure 4-5 :    We  add  the  edge_alpha  aesthetic  to  the  link  layer  to  make  links  transparent  based on how common or rare the bigram is.    We add directionality with an arrow, constructed using grid::arrow  , includ‐  ing an end_cap option that tells the arrow to end before touching the node.    We tinker with the options to the node layer to make the nodes more attractive.   We add a theme that’s useful for plotting networks, theme_void  .  set.seed 2016   a <- grid::arrow type = "closed", length = unit .15, "inches"    ggraph bigram_graph, layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link aes edge_alpha = n , show.legend = FALSE,                  arrow = a, end_cap = circle .07, 'inches'   +   geom_node_point color = "lightblue", size = 5  +   geom_node_text aes label = name , vjust = 1, hjust = 1  +   theme_void    Tokenizing by N-gram      57   Figure 4-5. Common bigrams in Pride and Prejudice, with some polishing  It may take a some experimentation with ggraph to get your networks into a presenta‐ ble format like this, but the network structure is a useful and flexible way to visualize relational tidy data.  Note  that  this  is  a  visualization  of  a  Markov  chain,  a  common model in text processing. In a Markov chain, each choice of word depends only on the previous word. In this case, a random genera‐ tor following this model might spit out “dear,” then “sir,” then “wil‐ liam walter thomas thomas’s” by following each word to the most common words that follow it. To make the visualization interpreta‐ ble, we chose to show only the most common word-to-word con‐ nections, but one could imagine an enormous graph representing all connections that occur in the text.  58      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations   Visualizing Bigrams in Other Texts We  went  to  a  good  amount  of  work  in  cleaning  and  visualizing  bigrams  on  a  text dataset, so let’s collect it into a function so that we can easily perform it on other text datasets.  To make it easy to use the functions count_bigrams   and visual ize_bigrams    yourself,  we’ve  also  reloaded  the  packages  neces‐ sary for them.  library dplyr  library tidyr  library tidytext  library ggplot2  library igraph  library ggraph   count_bigrams <- function dataset  {   dataset %>%     unnest_tokens bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2  %>%     separate bigram, c "word1", "word2" , sep = " "  %>%     filter !word1 %in% stop_words$word,            !word2 %in% stop_words$word  %>%     count word1, word2, sort = TRUE  }  visualize_bigrams <- function bigrams  {   set.seed 2016    a <- grid::arrow type = "closed", length = unit .15, "inches"      bigrams %>%     graph_from_data_frame   %>%     ggraph layout = "fr"  +     geom_edge_link aes edge_alpha = n , show.legend = FALSE, arrow = a  +     geom_node_point color = "lightblue", size = 5  +     geom_node_text aes label = name , vjust = 1, hjust = 1  +     theme_void   }  At this point, we could visualize bigrams in other works, such as the King James Bible  Figure 4-6 :   the King James version is book 10 on Project Gutenberg: library gutenbergr  kjv <- gutenberg_download 10   library stringr   kjv_bigrams  %  Tokenizing by N-gram      59     count_bigrams     filter out rare combinations, as well as digits kjv_bigrams %>%   filter n > 40,          !str_detect word1, "\\d" ,          !str_detect word2, "\\d"   %>%   visualize_bigrams    Figure 4-6. Directed graph of common bigrams in the King James Bible, showing those that occurred more than 40 times  Figure 4-6 thus lays out a common “blueprint” of language within the Bible, particu‐ larly  focused  around  “thy”  and  “thou”   which  could  probably  be  considered  stop words! .  You  can  use  the  gutenbergr  package  and  the  count_bigrams visual  60      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations   ize_bigrams functions to visualize bigrams in other classic books you’re interested in. Counting and Correlating Pairs of Words with the widyr Package Tokenizing by n-gram is a useful way to explore pairs of adjacent words. However, we may also be interested in words that tend to co-occur within particular documents or particular chapters, even if they don’t occur next to each other. Tidy data is a useful structure for comparing between variables or grouping by rows, but it can be challenging to compare between rows: for example, to count the number of times that two words appear within the same document, or to see how correlated they are. Most operations for finding pairwise counts or correlations need to turn the data into a wide matrix first. We’ll examine some of the ways tidy text can be turned into a wide matrix in Chap‐ ter 5, but in this case it isn’t necessary. The widyr package makes operations such as computing  counts  and  correlations  easy  by  simplifying  the  pattern  of  “widen  data, perform an operation, then re-tidy data”  Figure 4-7 . We’ll focus on a set of functions that  make  pairwise  comparisons  between  groups  of  observations   for  example, between documents, or sections of text .  Figure 4-7. The philosophy behind the widyr package, which can perform operations such as counting and correlating on pairs of values in a tidy dataset. The widyr package first “casts” a tidy dataset into a wide matrix, performs an operation such as a correla‐ tion on it, then re-tidies the result.  Counting and Correlating Pairs of Words with the widyr Package      61   Counting and Correlating Among Sections Consider the book Pride and Prejudice divided into 10-line sections, as we did  with larger  sections   for  sentiment  analysis  in  Chapter  2.  We  may  be  interested  in  what words tend to appear within the same section. austen_section_words  %   filter book == "Pride & Prejudice"  %>%   mutate section = row_number   % % 10  %>%   filter section > 0  %>%   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   filter !word %in% stop_words$word   One useful function from widyr is the pairwise_count   function. The prefix pair wise_ means it will result in one row for each pair of words in the word variable. This lets us count common pairs of words co-appearing within the same section.  austen_section_words    A tibble: 37,240 × 3                  book section         word                                1  Pride & Prejudice       1        truth  2  Pride & Prejudice       1  universally  3  Pride & Prejudice       1 acknowledged  4  Pride & Prejudice       1       single  5  Pride & Prejudice       1   possession  6  Pride & Prejudice       1      fortune  7  Pride & Prejudice       1         wife  8  Pride & Prejudice       1     feelings  9  Pride & Prejudice       1        views  10 Pride & Prejudice       1     entering   ... with 37,230 more rows  library widyr    count words co-occuring within sections word_pairs  %   pairwise_count word, section, sort = TRUE   word_pairs    A tibble: 796,008 × 3         item1     item2     n                    1      darcy elizabeth   144  2  elizabeth     darcy   144  3       miss elizabeth   110  4  elizabeth      miss   110  5  elizabeth      jane   106  6       jane elizabeth   106  7       miss     darcy    92  8      darcy      miss    92  62      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations    9  elizabeth   bingley    91  10   bingley elizabeth    91   ... with 795,998 more rows  Notice that while the input had one row for each pair of a document  a 10-line sec‐ tion  and a word, the output has one row for each pair of words. This is also a tidy format, but of a very different structure that we can use to answer new questions. For example, we can see that the most common pair of words in a section is “Eliza‐ beth” and “Darcy”  the two main characters . We can easily find the words that most often occur with Darcy.  word_pairs %>%   filter item1 == "darcy"     A tibble: 2,930 × 3     item1     item2     n                1  darcy elizabeth   144  2  darcy      miss    92  3  darcy   bingley    86  4  darcy      jane    46  5  darcy    bennet    45  6  darcy    sister    45  7  darcy      time    41  8  darcy      lady    38  9  darcy    friend    37  10 darcy   wickham    37   ... with 2,920 more rows  Examining Pairwise Correlation Pairs  like  “Elizabeth”  and  “Darcy”  are  the  most  common  co-occurring  words,  but that’s not particularly meaningful since they’re also the most common individual words.  We may instead want to examine correlation among words, which indicates how often they appear together relative to how often they appear separately. In particular, here we’ll focus on the phi coefficient, a common measure for binary correlation. The phi coefficient focuses on how much more likely it is that either both word X and Y appear, or neither do, than that one appears without the other. Consider Table 4-1.  Table 4-1. Values used to calculate the phi coefficient   Has word X No word X Total  Has word Y No word Y n11 n01 n · 1  Total n1 · n0 · n  n10 n00 n · 0  Counting and Correlating Pairs of Words with the widyr Package      63   For example, n11 represents the number of documents where both word X and word Y appear, n00 the number where neither appears, and n10 and n01 the cases where one appears without the other. In terms of this table, the phi coefficient is:  ϕ =  n11n00 − n10n01 n1 ·n0 ·n · 0n · 1  The phi coefficient is equivalent to the Pearson correlation, which you may have heard of elsewhere, when it is applied to binary data.  The pairwise_cor   function in widyr lets us find the phi coefficient between words based  on  how  often  they  appear  in  the  same  section.  Its  syntax  is  similar  to  pair wise_count  .   we need to filter for at least relatively common words first word_cors  %   group_by word  %>%   filter n   >= 20  %>%   pairwise_cor word, section, sort = TRUE   word_cors    A tibble: 154,842 × 3         item1     item2 correlation                          1     bourgh        de   0.9508501  2         de    bourgh   0.9508501  3     pounds  thousand   0.7005808  4   thousand    pounds   0.7005808  5    william       sir   0.6644719  6        sir   william   0.6644719  7  catherine      lady   0.6633048  8       lady catherine   0.6633048  9    forster   colonel   0.6220950  10   colonel   forster   0.6220950   ... with 154,832 more rows  word_cors %>%   filter item1 == "pounds"     A tibble: 393 × 3      item1     item2 correlation                       1  pounds  thousand  0.70058081  64      Chapter 4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations  This output format is helpful for exploration. For example, we could find the words most correlated with a word like “pounds” using a filter operation.    2  pounds       ten  0.23057580  3  pounds   fortune  0.16386264  4  pounds   settled  0.14946049  5  pounds wickham's  0.14152401  6  pounds  children  0.12900011  7  pounds  mother's  0.11905928  8  pounds  believed  0.09321518  9  pounds    estate  0.08896876  10 pounds     ready  0.08597038   ... with 383 more rows  This lets us pick particular interesting words and find the other words most associ‐ ated with them  Figure 4-8 .  word_cors %>%   filter item1 %in% c "elizabeth", "pounds", "married", "pride"   %>%   group_by item1  %>%   top_n 6  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate item2 = reorder item2, correlation   %>%   ggplot aes item2, correlation   +   geom_bar stat = "identity"  +   facet_wrap ~ item1, scales = "free"  +   coord_flip    Figure 4-8.

We can also see that while pairings of names and titles that dominated bigram pairings are common, such as “colonel fitzwilliam,” we can also see pairings of words that appear close to each other, such as “walk” and “park,” or “dance” and “ball.” Summary This chapter showed how the tidy text approach is useful not only for analyzing indi‐ vidual  words,  but  also  for  exploring  the  relationships  and  connections  between words. Such relationships can involve n-grams, which enable us to see what words tend to appear after others, or co-occurences and correlations, for words that appear in proximity to each other. This chapter also demonstrated the ggraph package for visualizing both of these types of relationships as networks. These network visualiza‐ tions are a flexible tool for exploring relationships, and will play an important role in the case studies in later chapters.  Summary      67   CHAPTER 5 Converting to and from Nontidy Formats  In the previous chapters, we’ve been analyzing text arranged in the tidy text format: a table with one token per document per row, such as is constructed by the function unnest_tokens  . This lets us use the popular suite of tidy tools such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 to explore and visualize text data. We’ve demonstrated that many infor‐ mative text analyses can be performed using these tools. However,  most  of  the  existing  R  tools  for  natural  language  processing,  besides  the tidytext package, aren’t compatible with this format. The CRAN Task View for Natu‐ ral Language Processing lists a large selection of packages that take other structures of input  and  provide  nontidy  outputs.  These  packages  are  very  useful  in  text  mining applications, and many existing text datasets are structured according to these for‐ mats. Computer scientist Hal Abelson has observed that, “No matter how complex and pol‐ ished the individual operations are, it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines the power of the system”  Abelson 2008 . In that spirit, this chapter will discuss the “glue” that connects the tidy text format with other important packages and data structures, allowing you to rely on both existing text mining packages and the suite of tidy tools to perform your analysis. Figure  5-1  illustrates  how  an  analysis  might  switch  between  tidy  and  nontidy  data structures and tools. This chapter will focus on the process of tidying document-term matrices, as well as casting a tidy data frame into a sparse matrix. We’ll also explore how to tidy Corpus objects, which combine raw text with document metadata, into text data frames, leading to a case study of ingesting and analyzing financial articles.  69   Figure 5-1. A flowchart of a typical text analysis that combines tidytext with other tools and data formats, particularly the tm or quanteda packages. This chapter shows how to convert back and forth between document-term matrices and tidy data frames, as well as convert from a Corpus object to a text data frame. Tidying a Document-Term Matrix One  of  the  most  common  structures  that  text  mining  packages  work  with  is  the document-term matrix  or DTM . This is a matrix where:    Each row represents one document  such as a book or article .   Each column represents one term.   Each value  typically  contains the number of appearances of that term in that  document.  Since most pairings of document and term do not occur  they have the value zero , DTMs are usually implemented as sparse matrices. These objects can be treated as though they were matrices  for example, accessing particular rows and columns , but are stored in a more efficient format. We’ll discuss several implementations of these matrices in this chapter. DTM objects cannot be used directly with tidy tools, just as tidy data frames cannot be used as input for most text mining packages. Thus, the tidytext package provides two verbs that convert between the two formats:  70      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats     tidy   turns a document-term matrix into a tidy data frame. This verb comes from the broom package  Robinson 2017 , which provides similar tidying func‐ tions for many statistical models and objects.    cast   turns a tidy one-term-per-row data frame into a matrix. tidytext provides three  variations  of  this  verb,  each  converting  to  a  different  type  of  matrix: cast_sparse     converting  to  a  sparse  matrix  from  the  Matrix  package , cast_dtm     converting  to  a  DocumentTermMatrix  object  from  tm ,  and cast_dfm    converting to a dfm object from quanteda .  As shown in Figure 5-1, a DTM is typically comparable to a tidy data frame after a count  or  a  group_by summarize  that  contains  counts  or  another  statistic  for  each combination of a term and document. Tidying DocumentTermMatrix Objects Perhaps the most widely used implementation of DTMs in R is the DocumentTermMa trix class in the tm package. Many available text mining datasets are provided in this format. For example, consider the collection of Associated Press newspaper articles included in the topicmodels package.  library tm   data "AssociatedPress", package = "topicmodels"  AssociatedPress    >  Non- sparse entries: 302031 23220327  Sparsity           : 99%  Maximal term length: 18  Weighting          : term frequency  tf   We see that this dataset contains documents  each of them an AP article  and terms  distinct words . Notice that this DTM is 99% sparse  99% of document-word pairs are zero . We could access the terms in the document with the Terms   function.  terms <- Terms AssociatedPress  head terms    [1] "aaron"      "abandon"    "abandoned"  "abandoning" "abbott"     "abboud" If we wanted to analyze this data with tidy tools, we would first need to turn it into a data frame with one token per document per row. The broom package introduced the tidy   verb, which takes a nontidy object and turns it into a tidy data frame. The tidytext package implements this method for DocumentTermMatrix objects.  Tidying a Document-Term Matrix      71   library dplyr  library tidytext   ap_td <- tidy AssociatedPress  ap_td    A tibble: 302,031 × 3     document       term count                    1         1     adding     1  2         1      adult     2  3         1        ago     1  4         1    alcohol     1  5         1  allegedly     1  6         1      allen     1  7         1 apparently     2  8         1   appeared     1  9         1   arrested     1  10        1    assault     1   ... with 302,021 more rows  Notice that we now have a tidy three-column tbl_df, with variables document, term, and count. This tidying operation is similar to the melt   function from the reshape2 package  Wickham 2007  for nonsparse matrices.  Notice that only the nonzero values are included in the tidied out‐ put: document 1 includes terms such as “adding” and “adult,” but not  “aaron”  or  “abandon.”  This  means  the  tidied  version  has  no rows where count is zero.  As we’ve seen in previous chapters, this form is convenient for analysis with the dplyr, tidytext, and ggplot2 packages. For example, you can perform sentiment analysis on these newspaper articles with the approach described in Chapter 2.  ap_sentiments  %   inner_join get_sentiments "bing" , by = c term = "word"    ap_sentiments    A tibble: 30,094 × 4     document    term count sentiment                       1         1 assault     1  negative  2         1 complex     1  negative  3         1   death     1  negative  4         1    died     1  negative  5         1    good     2  positive  6         1 illness     1  negative  7         1  killed     2  negative  8         1    like     2  positive  9         1   liked     1  positive  72      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats    10        1 miracle     1  positive   ... with 30,084 more rows  This would let us visualize which words from the AP articles most often contributed to positive or negative sentiment, seen in Figure 5-2. We can see that the most com‐ mon positive words include “like,” “work,” “support,” and “good,” while the most neg‐ ative words include “killed,” “death,” and “vice.”  The inclusion of “vice” as a negative term  is  probably  a  mistake  on  the  algorithm’s  part,  since  it  likely  usually  refers  to “vice president” .  library ggplot2   ap_sentiments %>%   count sentiment, term, wt = count  %>%   ungroup   %>%   filter n >= 200  %>%   mutate n = ifelse sentiment == "negative", -n, n   %>%   mutate term = reorder term, n   %>%   ggplot aes term, n, fill = sentiment   +   geom_bar stat = "identity"  +   ylab "Contribution to sentiment"  +   coord_flip    Figure 5-2.

Tidying a Document-Term Matrix      73   Tidying dfm Objects Other text mining packages provide alternative implementations of document-term matrices, such as the dfm  document-feature matrix  class from the quanteda package  Benoit and Nulty 2016 . For example, the quanteda package comes with a corpus of presidential inauguration speeches, which can be converted to a dfm using the appro‐ priate function.  library methods   inaug_dfm  data "data_corpus_inaugural", package = "quanteda"  inaug_dfm <- quanteda::dfm data_corpus_inaugural, verbose = FALSE    Document-feature matrix of: 58 documents, 9,232 features  91.6% sparse .  The  tidy method works on these document-feature matrices as well, turning them into a one-token-per-document-per-row table.  inaug_td <- tidy inaug_dfm  inaug_td    A tibble: 44,725 × 3            document   term count                       1  1789-Washington fellow     3  2  1793-Washington fellow     1  3       1797-Adams fellow     3  4   1801-Jefferson fellow     7  5   1805-Jefferson fellow     8  6     1809-Madison fellow     1  7     1813-Madison fellow     1  8      1817-Monroe fellow     6  9      1821-Monroe fellow    10  10      1825-Adams fellow     3   ... with 44,715 more rows  We  may  be  interested  in  finding  the  words  most  specific  to  each  of  the  inaugural speeches. This could be quantified by calculating the tf-idf of each term-speech pair using the bind_tf_idf   function, as described in Chapter 3.  inaug_tf_idf  %   bind_tf_idf term, document, count  %>%   arrange desc tf_idf    inaug_tf_idf    A tibble: 44,725 × 6            document        term count          tf      idf     tf_idf                                                1  1793-Washington      arrive     1 0.006802721 4.060443 0.02762206  2  1793-Washington upbraidings     1 0.006802721 4.060443 0.02762206  74      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats    3  1793-Washington    violated     1 0.006802721 3.367296 0.02290677  4  1793-Washington   willingly     1 0.006802721 3.367296 0.02290677  5  1793-Washington   incurring     1 0.006802721 3.367296 0.02290677  6  1793-Washington    previous     1 0.006802721 2.961831 0.02014851  7  1793-Washington   knowingly     1 0.006802721 2.961831 0.02014851  8  1793-Washington injunctions     1 0.006802721 2.961831 0.02014851  9  1793-Washington   witnesses     1 0.006802721 2.961831 0.02014851  10 1793-Washington     besides     1 0.006802721 2.674149 0.01819149   ... with 44,715 more rows  We could use this data to pick four notable inaugural addresses  from Presidents Lin‐ coln, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Obama , and visualize the words most specific to each speech, as shown in Figure 5-3.  Figure 5-3. The terms with the highest tf-idf from each of four selected inaugural addresses. Note that quanteda’s tokenizer includes the “?” punctuation mark as a term, though the texts we’ve tokenized ourselves with unnest_tokens do not.  Tidying a Document-Term Matrix      75   As another example of a visualization possible with tidy data, we could extract the year  from  each  document’s  name,  and  compute  the  total  number  of  words  within each year.  Note that we’ve used tidyr’s complete   function to include zeroes  cases where a word doesn’t appear in a document  in the table.  library tidyr   year_term_counts  %   extract document, "year", " \\d+ ", convert = TRUE  %>%   complete year, term, fill = list count = 0   %>%   group_by year  %>%   mutate year_total = sum count    This  lets  us  pick  several  words  and  visualize  how  they  changed  in  frequency  over time, as shown in Figure 5-4. We can see that over time, American presidents became less likely to refer to the country as the “Union” and more likely to refer to “America.” They also became less likely to talk about the “Constitution” and “foreign” countries, and more likely to mention “freedom” and “God.”  year_term_counts %>%   filter term %in% c "god", "america", "foreign",                      "union", "constitution", "freedom"   %>%   ggplot aes year, count   year_total   +   geom_point   +   geom_smooth   +   facet_wrap ~ term, scales = "free_y"  +   scale_y_continuous labels = scales::percent_format    +   ylab "% frequency of word in inaugural address"   76      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats   Figure 5-4. Changes in word frequency over time within Presidential inaugural addresses, for four selected terms  These examples show how you can use tidytext, and the related suite of tidy tools, to analyze sources even if their origin is not in a tidy format. Casting Tidy Text Data into a Matrix Just as some existing text mining packages provide document-term matrices as sam‐ ple data or output, some algorithms expect such matrices as input. Therefore, tidytext provides cast_ verbs for converting from a tidy form to these matrices. For example, we could take the tidied AP dataset and cast it back into a document- term matrix using the cast_dtm   function.  ap_td %>%   cast_dtm document, term, count     >  Non- sparse entries: 302031 23220327  Sparsity           : 99%  Maximal term length: 18  Weighting          : term frequency  tf   Casting Tidy Text Data into a Matrix      77   Similarly,  we  could  cast  the  table  into  a  dfm  object  from  quanteda’s  dfm  with cast_dfm  . ap_td %>%   cast_dfm term, document, count    Document-feature matrix of: 10,473 documents, 2,246 features  98.7% sparse .  Some tools simply require a sparse matrix.  library Matrix    cast into a Matrix object m  %   cast_sparse document, term, count   class m    [1] "dgCMatrix"  attr ,"package"   [1] "Matrix"  dim m    [1]  2246 10473  library janeaustenr   austen_dtm  %   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   count book, word  %>%   cast_dtm book, word, n   austen_dtm  This  kind  of  conversion  could  easily  be  done  from  any  of  the  tidy  text  structures we’ve used so far in this book. For example, we could create a DTM of Jane Austen’s books in just a few lines of code.    >  Non- sparse entries: 40379 46741  Sparsity           : 54%  Maximal term length: 19  Weighting          : term frequency  tf   This  casting  process  allows  for  reading,  filtering,  and  processing  to  be  done  using dplyr and other tidy tools, after which the data can be converted into a document- term  matrix  for  machine  learning  applications.  In  Chapter  6,  we’ll  examine  some examples where a tidy text dataset has to be converted into a DocumentTermMatrix for processing.  78      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats   Tidying Corpus Objects with Metadata Some data structures are designed to store document collections before tokenization, often called a “corpus.” One common example is Corpus objects from the tm package. These store text alongside metadata, which may include an ID, date time, title, or lan‐ guage for each document. For example, the tm package comes with the acq corpus, containing 50 articles from the news service Reuters.    >  Metadata:  corpus specific: 0, document level  indexed : 0  Content:  documents: 50  data "acq"  acq   first document acq[[1]]    >  Metadata:  15  Content:  chars: 1287  A  Corpus  object  is  structured  like  a  list,  with  each  item  containing  both  text  and metadata  see the tm documentation for more on working with Corpus objects . This is a flexible storage method for documents, but doesn’t lend itself to processing with tidy tools. We can thus use the tidy   method to construct a table with one row per document, including  the  metadata   such  as  id  and  datetimestamp   as  columns  alongside  the text.  acq_td <- tidy acq  acq_td    A tibble: 50 × 16                        author       datetimestamp description                                                   1                         1987-02-26 10:18:06  2                         1987-02-26 10:19:15  3                         1987-02-26 10:49:56  4  By Cal Mankowski, Reuters 1987-02-26 10:51:17  5                         1987-02-26 11:08:33  6                         1987-02-26 11:32:37  7      By Patti Domm, Reuter 1987-02-26 11:43:13  8                         1987-02-26 11:59:25  9                         1987-02-26 12:01:28  10                        1987-02-26 12:08:27                                              heading    id language                                                          1   COMPUTER TERMINAL SYSTEMS   COMPLETES SALE    10       en  Tidying Corpus Objects with Metadata      79    2    OHIO MATTRESS   MAY HAVE LOWER 1ST QTR NET    12       en  3     MCLEAN'S   U.S. LINES SETS ASSET TRANSFER    44       en  4    CHEMLAWN   RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS    45       en  5      BUYS GULFEX FOR UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT    68       en  6          INVESTMENT FIRMS CUT CYCLOPS   STAKE    96       en  7  AMERICAN EXPRESS   SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF   110       en  8   HONG KONG FIRM UPS WRATHER  STAKE TO 11 PCT   125       en  9               LIEBERT CORP   APPROVES MERGER   128       en  10     GULF APPLIED TECHNOLOGIES   SELLS UNITS   134       en   ... with 40 more rows, and 10 more variables: language  , origin  ,     topics  , lewissplit  , cgisplit  , oldid  ,     places  , people  , orgs  , exchanges  , text    This can then be used with unnest_tokens   to, for example, find the most common words across the 50 Reuters articles, or the ones most specific to each article.  acq_tokens  %   select -places  %>%   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   anti_join stop_words, by = "word"    most common words acq_tokens %>%   count word, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 1,566 × 2         word     n             1      dlrs   100  2       pct    70  3       mln    65  4   company    63  5    shares    52  6    reuter    50  7     stock    46  8     offer    34  9     share    34  10 american    28   ... with 1,556 more rows   tf-idf acq_tokens %>%   count id, word  %>%   bind_tf_idf word, id, n  %>%   arrange desc tf_idf     Source: local data frame [2,853 x 6]  Groups: id [50]         id     word     n         tf      idf    tf_idf                                 1    186   groupe     2 0.13333333 3.912023 0.5216031  2    128  liebert     3 0.13043478 3.912023 0.5102639  3    474  esselte     5 0.10869565 3.912023 0.4252199  80      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats    4    371  burdett     6 0.10344828 3.912023 0.4046920  5    442 hazleton     4 0.10256410 3.912023 0.4012331  6    199  circuit     5 0.10204082 3.912023 0.3991860  7    162 suffield     2 0.10000000 3.912023 0.3912023  8    498     west     3 0.10000000 3.912023 0.3912023  9    441      rmj     8 0.12121212 3.218876 0.3901668  10   467  nursery     3 0.09677419 3.912023 0.3785829   ... with 2,843 more rows  Example: Mining Financial Articles Corpus  objects  are  a  common  output  format  for  data-ingesting  packages,  which means the tidy   function gives us access to a wide variety of text data. One example is  tm.plugin.webmining,  which  connects  to  online  feeds  to  retrieve  news  articles based  on  a  keyword.  For  instance,  performing  WebCorpus GoogleFinance Source "NASDAQ:MSFT"    allows us to retrieve the 20 most recent articles related to the Microsoft  MSFT  stock. Here we’ll retrieve recent articles relevant to nine major technology stocks: Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, IBM, Yahoo, and Netflix.  These results were downloaded in January 2017, when this chapter was written, so you’ll certainly find different results if you run it for yourself. Note that this code takes several minutes to run.  library tm.plugin.webmining  library purrr   company <- c "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Amazon", "Facebook",              "Twitter", "IBM", "Yahoo", "Netflix"  symbol <- c "MSFT", "AAPL", "GOOG", "AMZN", "FB", "TWTR", "IBM", "YHOO", "NFLX"   download_articles <- function symbol  {   WebCorpus GoogleFinanceSource paste0 "NASDAQ:", symbol    }  stock_articles <- data_frame company = company,                              symbol = symbol  %>%   mutate corpus = map symbol, download_articles    This  uses  the  map    function  from  the  purrr  package,  which  applies  a  function  to each item in symbol to create a list, which we store in the corpus list column.  stock_articles    A tibble: 9 × 3      company symbol          corpus                         Tidying Corpus Objects with Metadata      81    1 Microsoft   MSFT    2     Apple   AAPL    3    Google   GOOG    4    Amazon   AMZN    5  Facebook     FB    6   Twitter   TWTR    7       IBM    IBM    8     Yahoo   YHOO    9   Netflix   NFLX    Each of the items in the corpus list column is a WebCorpus object, which is a special case of a corpus like acq.

As we’d expect, the company’s name and symbol are typically included, but so are several of their product offerings and executives, as well as companies they are making deals with  such as Disney with Netflix .  82      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats   Figure 5-5. The eight words with the highest tf-idf in recent articles specific to each com‐ pany  If we were interested in using recent news to analyze the market and make invest‐ ment decisions, we’d likely want to use sentiment analysis to determine whether the news coverage was positive or negative. Before we run such an analysis, we should look at what words would contribute the most to positive and negative sentiments, as was shown in “Most Common Positive and Negative Words” on page 22. For exam‐ ple, we could examine this within the AFINN lexicon  Figure 5-6 .  stock_tokens %>%   anti_join stop_words, by = "word"  %>%   count word, id, sort = TRUE  %>%   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn" , by = "word"  %>%   group_by word  %>%  Tidying Corpus Objects with Metadata      83     summarize contribution = sum n * score   %>%   top_n 12, abs contribution   %>%   mutate word = reorder word, contribution   %>%   ggplot aes word, contribution   +   geom_col   +   coord_flip   +   labs y = "Frequency of word * AFINN score"   Figure 5-6. The words with the largest contribution to sentiment scores in recent finan‐ cial articles, according to the AFINN dictionary. The “contribution” is the product of the word and the sentiment score.  In the context of these financial articles, there are a few big red flags here. The words “share” and “shares” are counted as positive verbs by the AFINN lexicon  “Alice will share her cake with Bob” , but they’re actually neutral nouns  “The stock price is $12 per share”  that could just as easily be in a positive sentence as a negative one. The word “fool” is even more deceptive: it refers to Motley Fool, a financial services com‐ pany. In short, we can see that the AFINN sentiment lexicon is entirely unsuited to the context of financial data  as are the NRC and Bing lexicons . Instead, we introduce another sentiment lexicon: the Loughran and McDonald dic‐ tionary of financial sentiment terms  Loughran and McDonald 2011 . This dictionary was developed based on analyses of financial reports, and intentionally avoids words like “share” and “fool,” as well as subtler terms like “liability” and “risk” that may not have a negative meaning in a financial context. The  Loughran  data  divides  words  into  six  sentiments:  “positive,”  “negative,”  “liti‐ gious,”  “uncertain,”  “constraining,”  and  “superfluous.”  We  could  start  by  examining  84      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats   the  most  common  words  belonging  to  each  sentiment  within  this  text  dataset  Figure 5-7 .  stock_tokens %>%   count word  %>%   inner_join get_sentiments "loughran" , by = "word"  %>%   group_by sentiment  %>%   top_n 5, n  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = reorder word, n   %>%   ggplot aes word, n   +   geom_col   +   coord_flip   +   facet_wrap ~ sentiment, scales = "free"  +   ylab "Frequency of this word in the recent financial articles"   Figure 5-7. The most common words in the financial news articles associated with each of the six sentiments in the Loughran and McDonald lexicon  These assignments  Figure 5-7  of words to sentiments look more reasonable: com‐ mon positive words include “strong” and “better,” but not “shares” or “growth,” while negative words include “volatility” but not “fool.” The other sentiments look reason‐ able as well: the most common “uncertainty” terms include “could” and “may.”  Tidying Corpus Objects with Metadata      85   Now  that  we  know  we  can  trust  the  dictionary  to  approximate  the  articles’  senti‐ ments,  we  can  use  our  typical  methods  for  counting  the  number  of  uses  of  each sentiment-associated word in each corpus.  stock_sentiment_count  %   inner_join get_sentiments "loughran" , by = "word"  %>%   count sentiment, company  %>%   spread sentiment, n, fill = 0   stock_sentiment_count    A tibble: 9 × 7      company constraining litigious negative positive superfluous uncertainty  *                                                 1    Amazon            7         8       84      144           3          70  2     Apple            9        11      161      156           2         132  3  Facebook            4        32      128      150           4          81  4    Google            7         8       60      103           0          58  5       IBM            8        22      147      148           0         104  6 Microsoft            6        19       92      129           3         116  7   Netflix            4         7      111      162           0         106  8   Twitter            4        12      157       79           1          75  9     Yahoo            3        28      130       74           0          71  It might be interesting to examine which company has the most news with “litigious” or “uncertain” terms. But the simplest measure, much as it was for most analyses in Chapter 2, is to see whether the news is more positive or negative. As a general quan‐ titative measure of sentiment, we’ll use  positive - negative     positive + neg ative   Figure 5-8 .  stock_sentiment_count %>%   mutate score =  positive - negative     positive + negative   %>%   mutate company = reorder company, score   %>%   ggplot aes company, score, fill = score > 0   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   coord_flip   +   labs x = "Company",        y = "Positivity score among 20 recent news articles"   86      Chapter 5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats   Figure 5-8. “Positivity” of the news coverage around each stock in January 2017, calcula‐ ted as  positive - negative     positive + negative , based on uses of positive and negative words in 20 recent news articles about each company  Based on this analysis, we’d say that in January 2017, most of the coverage of Yahoo and  Twitter  was  strongly  negative,  while  coverage  of  Google  and  Amazon  was  the most positive. A glance at current financial headlines suggests that it’s on the right track. If you were interested in further analysis, you could use one of R’s many quanti‐ tative finance packages to compare these articles to recent stock prices and other met‐ rics. Summary Text analysis requires working with a variety of tools, many of which have inputs and outputs that aren’t in a tidy form. This chapter showed how to convert between a tidy text data frame and sparse document-term matrices, as well as how to tidy a Corpus object  containing  document  metadata.  The  next  chapter  will  demonstrate  another notable example of a package, topicmodels, that requires a document-term matrix as input, showing that these conversion tools are an essential part of text analysis.  Summary      87   CHAPTER 6 Topic Modeling  In text mining, we often have collections of documents, such as blog posts or news articles, that we’d like to divide into natural groups so that we can understand them separately. Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of such docu‐ ments,  similar  to  clustering  on  numeric  data,  which  finds  natural  groups  of  items even when we’re not sure what we’re looking for. Latent Dirichlet allocation  LDA  is a particularly popular method for fitting a topic model. It treats each document as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture of words. This allows documents to “overlap” each other in terms of content, rather than being separated into discrete groups, in a way that mirrors typical use of natural lan‐ guage. As Figure 6-1 shows, we can use tidy text principles to approach topic modeling with the same set of tidy tools we’ve used throughout this book. In this chapter, we’ll learn to  work  with  LDA  objects  from  the  topicmodels  package,  particularly  tidying  such models so that they can be manipulated with ggplot2 and dplyr. We’ll also explore an example  of  clustering  chapters  from  several  books,  where  we  can  see  that  a  topic model “learns” to tell the difference between the four books based on the text content.  89   Figure 6-1. A flowchart of a text analysis that incorporates topic modeling. The topicmo‐ dels package takes a document-term matrix as input and produces a model that can be tidied by tidytext, such that it can be manipulated and visualized with dplyr and ggplot2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation Latent Dirichlet allocation is one of the most common algorithms for topic modeling. Without diving into the math behind the model, we can understand it as being gui‐ ded by two principles: Every document is a mixture of topics  We imagine that each document may contain words from several topics in partic‐ ular proportions. For example, in a two-topic model we could say “Document 1 is 90% topic A and 10% topic B, while Document 2 is 30% topic A and 70% topic B.”  Every topic is a mixture of words  For example, we could imagine a two-topic model of American news, with one topic for “politics” and one for “entertainment.” The most common words in the politics  topic  might  be  “President,”  “Congress,”  and  “government,”  while  the entertainment topic may be made up of words such as “movies,” “television,” and “actor.” Importantly, words can be shared between topics; a word like “budget” might appear in both equally.  90      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling   LDA is a mathematical method for estimating both of these at the same time: finding the mixture of words that is associated with each topic, while also determining the mixture  of  topics  that  describes  each  document.  There  are  a  number  of  existing implementations of this algorithm, and we’ll explore one of them in depth. In  Chapter  5  we  briefly  introduced  the  AssociatedPress  dataset,  provided  by  the topicmodels package, as an example of a DocumentTermMatrix. This is a collection of 2,246 news articles from an American news agency, mostly published around 1988.  library topicmodels   data "AssociatedPress"  AssociatedPress    >  Non- sparse entries: 302031 23220327  Sparsity           : 99%  Maximal term length: 18  Weighting          : term frequency  tf   We can use the LDA   function from the topicmodels package, setting k = 2, to create a two-topic LDA model.  Almost any topic model in practice will use a larger k, but we will soon see that this analysis approach extends to a larger number of topics.  This function returns an object containing the full details of the model fit, such as how words are associated with topics and how topics are associated with documents.   set a seed so that the output of the model is predictable ap_lda <- LDA AssociatedPress, k = 2, control = list seed = 1234   ap_lda   A LDA_VEM topic model with 2 topics.  Fitting the model was the “easy part”: the rest of the analysis will involve exploring and interpreting the model using tidying functions from the tidytext package. Word-Topic Probabilities In Chapter 5 we introduced the tidy   method, originally from the broom package  Robinson  2017 ,  for  tidying  model  objects.  The  tidytext  package  provides  this method  for  extracting  the  per-topic-per-word  probabilities,  called  β   “beta” ,  from the model.  Latent Dirichlet Allocation      91   library tidytext   ap_topics <- tidy ap_lda, matrix = "beta"  ap_topics    A tibble: 20,946 × 3     topic       term         beta                        1      1      aaron 1.686917e-12  2      2      aaron 3.895941e-05  3      1    abandon 2.654910e-05  4      2    abandon 3.990786e-05  5      1  abandoned 1.390663e-04  6      2  abandoned 5.876946e-05  7      1 abandoning 2.454843e-33  8      2 abandoning 2.337565e-05  9      1     abbott 2.130484e-06  10     2     abbott 2.968045e-05   ... with 20,936 more rows  Notice that this has turned the model into a one-topic-per-term-per-row format. For each combination, the model computes the probability of that term being generated from that topic. For example, the term “aaron” has a 1.686917 × 10-12 probability of being generated from topic 1, but a 3.8959408 × 10-5 probability of being generated from topic 2. We could use dplyr’s top_n   to find the 10 terms that are most common within each topic. As a tidy data frame, this lends itself well to a ggplot2 visualization  Figure 6-2 .  library ggplot2  library dplyr   ap_top_terms  %   group_by topic  %>%   top_n 10, beta  %>%   ungroup   %>%   arrange topic, -beta   ap_top_terms %>%   mutate term = reorder term, beta   %>%   ggplot aes term, beta, fill = factor topic    +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ topic, scales = "free"  +   coord_flip    92      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling   Figure 6-2. The terms that are most common within each topic  This visualization lets us understand the two topics that were extracted from the arti‐ cles. The most common words in topic 1 include “percent,” “million,” “billion,” and “company,” which suggests it may represent business or financial news. Those most common in topic 2 include “president,” “government,” and “soviet,” suggeting that this topic represents political news. One important observation about the words in each topic is that some words, such as “new” and “people,” are common within both topics. This is an advantage of topic modeling as opposed to “hard clustering” methods: top‐ ics used in natural language could have some overlap in terms of words. As an alternative, we could consider the terms that had the greatest difference in β between topic 1 and topic 2. This can be estimated based on the log ratio of the two: log2  .  β2 β1  A log ratio is useful because it makes the difference symmetrical: β2 being twice as large leads to a log ratio of 1, while β1 being twice as large results in –1.  To constrain it to a set of especially relevant words, we can filter for relatively com‐ mon words, such as those that have a β greater than 1 1000 in at least one topic.

Figure 6-3. Words with the greatest difference in β between topic 2 and topic 1  We can see that the words more common in topic 2 include political parties such as “democratic”  and  “republican,”  as  well  as  politician’s  names  such  as  “dukakis”  and  94      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling   “gorbachev.”  Topic  1  is  more  characterized  by  currencies  like  “yen”  and  “dollar,”  as well as financial terms such as “index,” “prices,” and “rates.” This helps confirm that the two topics the algorithm identified are political and financial news. Document-Topic Probabilities Besides estimating each topic as a mixture of words, LDA also models each document as  a  mixture  of  topics.  We  can  examine  the  per-document-per-topic  probabilities, called γ  “gamma” , with the matrix = "gamma" argument to tidy  .  ap_documents <- tidy ap_lda, matrix = "gamma"  ap_documents    A tibble: 4,492 × 3     document topic        gamma                      1         1     1 0.2480616686  2         2     1 0.3615485445  3         3     1 0.5265844180  4         4     1 0.3566530023  5         5     1 0.1812766762  6         6     1 0.0005883388  7         7     1 0.7734215655  8         8     1 0.0044516994  9         9     1 0.9669915139  10       10     1 0.1468904793   ... with 4,482 more rows  tidy AssociatedPress  %>%   filter document == 6  %>%   arrange desc count      A tibble: 287 × 3     document           term count                        1         6        noriega    16  2         6         panama    12  3         6        jackson     6  4         6         powell     6  5         6 administration     5  6         6       economic     5  Each of these values is an estimated proportion of words from that document that are generated from that topic. For example, the model estimates that only about 24.8% of the words in document 1 are generated from topic 1. We can see that many of these documents are drawn from a mix of the two topics, but that document 6 is drawn almost entirely from topic 2, having a γ from topic 1 close to zero. To check this answer, we could tidy   the document-term matrix  see “Tidy‐ ing a Document-Term Matrix” on page 70  and check what the most common words in that document are.  Latent Dirichlet Allocation      95    7         6        general     5  8         6              i     5  9         6     panamanian     5  10        6       american     4   ... with 277 more rows  Based on the most common words, this appears to be an article about the relationship between the American government and Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, which means the algorithm was right to place it in topic 2  as political national news . Example: The Great Library Heist When examining a statistical method, it can be useful to try it on a very simple case where you know the “right answer.” For example, we could collect a set of documents that  definitely  relate  to  four  separate  topics,  then  perform  topic  modeling  to  see whether the algorithm can correctly distinguish the four groups. This lets us double- check that the method is useful, and gain a sense of how and when it can go wrong. We’ll try this with some data from classic literature. Suppose a vandal has broken into your study and torn apart four of your books:    Great Expectations by Charles Dickens   The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells   Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne   Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen  This vandal has torn the books into individual chapters, and left them in one large pile. How can we restore these disorganized chapters to their original books? This is a challenging problem since the individual chapters are unlabeled: we don’t know what words might distinguish them into groups. We’ll thus use topic modeling to discover how chapters cluster into distinct topics, each of them  presumably  representing one of the books. We’ll retrieve the text of these four books using the gutenbergr package introduced in Chapter 3.  titles <- c "Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea", "The War of the Worlds",             "Pride and Prejudice", "Great Expectations"   library gutenbergr   books  %   gutenberg_download meta_fields = "title"   As  preprocessing,  we  divide  these  into  chapters,  use  tidytext’s  unnest_tokens    to separate them into words, then remove stop_words. We’re treating every chapter as a separate  “document,”  each  with  a  name  like  Great  Expectations_1  or  Pride  and  96      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling   Prejudice_11.  In other applications, each document might be one newspaper arti‐ cle, or one blog post . library stringr    divide into documents, each representing one chapter reg <- regex "^chapter ", ignore_case = TRUE  by_chapter  %   group_by title  %>%   mutate chapter = cumsum str_detect text, reg    %>%   ungroup   %>%   filter chapter > 0  %>%   unite document, title, chapter    split into words by_chapter_word  %   unnest_tokens word, text    find document-word counts word_counts  %   anti_join stop_words  %>%   count document, word, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    word_counts    A tibble: 104,721 × 3                     document    word     n                                 1     Great Expectations_57     joe    88  2      Great Expectations_7     joe    70  3     Great Expectations_17   biddy    63  4     Great Expectations_27     joe    58  5     Great Expectations_38 estella    58  6      Great Expectations_2     joe    56  7     Great Expectations_23  pocket    53  8     Great Expectations_15     joe    50  9     Great Expectations_18     joe    50  10 The War of the Worlds_16 brother    50   ... with 104,711 more rows  LDA on Chapters Right now our data frame word_counts is in a tidy form, with one term per document per row, but the topicmodels package requires a DocumentTermMatrix. As described in “Casting Tidy Text Data into a Matrix” on page 77, we can cast a one-token-per- row table into a DocumentTermMatrix with tidytext’s cast_dtm  .  Example: The Great Library Heist      97   chapters_dtm  %   cast_dtm document, word, n   chapters_dtm    >  Non- sparse entries: 104721 3410774  Sparsity           : 97%  Maximal term length: 19  Weighting          : term frequency  tf   We  can  then  use  the  LDA    function  to  create  a  four-topic  model.  In  this  case  we know we’re looking for four topics because there are four books; in other problems we may need to try a few different values of k.  chapters_lda <- LDA chapters_dtm, k = 4, control = list seed = 1234   chapters_lda   A LDA_VEM topic model with 4 topics.  Much  as  we  did  on  the  Associated  Press  data,  we  can  examine  per-topic-per-word probabilities.  chapter_topics <- tidy chapters_lda, matrix = "beta"  chapter_topics    A tibble: 72,860 × 3     topic    term         beta                     1      1     joe 5.830326e-17  2      2     joe 3.194447e-57  3      3     joe 4.162676e-24  4      4     joe 1.445030e-02  5      1   biddy 7.846976e-27  6      2   biddy 4.672244e-69  7      3   biddy 2.259711e-46  8      4   biddy 4.767972e-03  9      1 estella 3.827272e-06  10     2 estella 5.316964e-65   ... with 72,850 more rows  top_terms  %   group_by topic  %>%   top_n 5, beta  %>%   ungroup   %>%   arrange topic, -beta   98      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling  Notice that this has turned the model into a one-topic-per-term-per-row format. For each combination, the model computes the probability of that term being generated from that topic. For example, the term “joe” has an almost zero probability of being generated from topics 1, 2, or 3, but it makes up 1.45% of topic 4. We could use dplyr’s top_n   to find the top five terms within each topic.   top_terms    A tibble: 20 × 3     topic      term        beta                      1      1 elizabeth 0.014107538  2      1     darcy 0.008814258  3      1      miss 0.008706741  4      1    bennet 0.006947431  5      1      jane 0.006497512  6      2   captain 0.015507696  7      2  nautilus 0.013050048  8      2       sea 0.008850073  9      2      nemo 0.008708397  10     2       ned 0.008030799  11     3    people 0.006797400  12     3  martians 0.006512569  13     3      time 0.005347115  14     3     black 0.005278302  15     3     night 0.004483143  16     4       joe 0.014450300  17     4      time 0.006847574  18     4       pip 0.006817363  19     4    looked 0.006365257  20     4      miss 0.006228387  This tidy output lends itself well to a ggplot2 visualization  Figure 6-4 .  library ggplot2   top_terms %>%   mutate term = reorder term, beta   %>%   ggplot aes term, beta, fill = factor topic    +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ topic, scales = "free"  +   coord_flip    Example: The Great Library Heist      99   Figure 6-4. The terms that are most common within each topic  These  topics  are  pretty  clearly  associated  with  the  four  books!  There’s  no  question that the topic of “captain,” “nautilus,” “sea,” and “nemo” belongs to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea; and that “jane,” “darcy,” and “elizabeth” belongs to Pride and Prejudice.  We  see  “pip”  and  “joe”  from  Great  Expectations,  and  “martians,”  “black,” and “night” from The War of the Worlds. We also notice that, in line with LDA being a “fuzzy clustering” method, there can be words in common between multiple topics, such as “miss” in topics 1 and 4, and “time” in topics 3 and 4. Per-Document Classification Each document in this analysis represented a single chapter. Thus, we may want to know which topics are associated with each document. Can we put the chapters back together in the correct books? We can find this by examining the per-document-per- topic probabilities, γ  “gamma” .  chapters_gamma <- tidy chapters_lda, matrix = "gamma"  chapters_gamma  100      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling     A tibble: 772 × 3                     document topic        gamma                                      1     Great Expectations_57     1 1.351886e-05  2      Great Expectations_7     1 1.470726e-05  3     Great Expectations_17     1 2.117127e-05  4     Great Expectations_27     1 1.919746e-05  5     Great Expectations_38     1 3.544403e-01  6      Great Expectations_2     1 1.723723e-05  7     Great Expectations_23     1 5.507241e-01  8     Great Expectations_15     1 1.682503e-02  9     Great Expectations_18     1 1.272044e-05  10 The War of the Worlds_16     1 1.084337e-05   ... with 762 more rows  Each of these values is an estimated proportion of words from that document that are generated from that topic. For example, the model estimates that each word in the Great Expectations_57 document has only a 0.00135% probability of coming from topic 1  Pride and Prejudice . Now that we have these topic probabilities, we can see how well our unsupervised learning did at distinguishing the four books. We’d expect that chapters within a book would be found to be mostly  or entirely  generated from the corresponding topic. First we re-separate the document name into title and chapter, after which we can vis‐ ualize the per-document-per-topic probability for each  Figure 6-5 .  chapters_gamma  %   separate document, c "title", "chapter" , sep = "_", convert = TRUE   chapters_gamma    A tibble: 772 × 4                     title chapter topic        gamma  *                                    1     Great Expectations      57     1 1.351886e-05  2     Great Expectations       7     1 1.470726e-05  3     Great Expectations      17     1 2.117127e-05  4     Great Expectations      27     1 1.919746e-05  5     Great Expectations      38     1 3.544403e-01  6     Great Expectations       2     1 1.723723e-05  7     Great Expectations      23     1 5.507241e-01  8     Great Expectations      15     1 1.682503e-02  9     Great Expectations      18     1 1.272044e-05  10 The War of the Worlds      16     1 1.084337e-05   ... with 762 more rows   reorder titles in order of topic 1, topic 2, etc. before plotting chapters_gamma %>%   mutate title = reorder title, gamma * topic   %>%   ggplot aes factor topic , gamma   +   geom_boxplot   +   facet_wrap ~ title   Example: The Great Library Heist      101   Figure 6-5. The gamma probabilities for each chapter within each book  We notice that almost all of the chapters from Pride and Prejudice, The War of the Worlds,  and  Twenty  Thousand  Leagues  Under  the  Sea  were  uniquely  identified  as  a single topic each. It does look like some chapters from Great Expectations  which should be topic 4  were somewhat associated with other topics. Are there any cases where the topic most associated with a chapter belonged to another book? First we’d find the topic that was most associated with each chapter using top_n  , which is effectively the “classifica‐ tion” of that chapter.  chapter_classifications  %   group_by title, chapter  %>%   top_n 1, gamma  %>%  102      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling     ungroup    chapter_classifications    A tibble: 193 × 4                   title chapter topic     gamma                                  1   Great Expectations      23     1 0.5507241  2  Pride and Prejudice      43     1 0.9999610  3  Pride and Prejudice      18     1 0.9999654  4  Pride and Prejudice      45     1 0.9999038  5  Pride and Prejudice      16     1 0.9999466  6  Pride and Prejudice      29     1 0.9999300  7  Pride and Prejudice      10     1 0.9999203  8  Pride and Prejudice       8     1 0.9999134  9  Pride and Prejudice      56     1 0.9999337  10 Pride and Prejudice      47     1 0.9999506   ... with 183 more rows  book_topics  %   count title, topic  %>%   group_by title  %>%   top_n 1, n  %>%   ungroup   %>%   transmute consensus = title, topic   chapter_classifications %>%   inner_join book_topics, by = "topic"  %>%   filter title != consensus   We can then compare each to the “consensus” topic for each book  the most common topic among its chapters , and see which were most often misidentified.    A tibble: 2 × 5                 title chapter topic     gamma             consensus                                                  1 Great Expectations      23     1 0.5507241   Pride and Prejudice  2 Great Expectations      54     3 0.4803234 The War of the Worlds  We  see  that  only  two  chapters  from  Great  Expectations  were  misclassified,  as  LDA described one as coming from the Pride and Prejudice topic  topic 1  and one from The War of the Worlds  topic 3 . That’s not bad for unsupervised clustering! By-Word Assignments: augment One step of the LDA algorithm is assigning each word in each document to a topic. The more words in a document are assigned to that topic, generally, the more weight  gamma  will go on that document-topic classification. We may want to take the original document-word pairs and find which words in each document were assigned to which topic. This is the job of the  augment   function, which also originated in the broom package as a way of tidying model output. While  Example: The Great Library Heist      103   tidy   retrieves the statistical components of the model, augment   uses a model to add information to each observation in the original data.  assignments <- augment chapters_lda, data = chapters_dtm  assignments    A tibble: 104,721 × 4                  document  term count .topic                               1  Great Expectations_57   joe    88      4  2   Great Expectations_7   joe    70      4  3  Great Expectations_17   joe     5      4  4  Great Expectations_27   joe    58      4  5   Great Expectations_2   joe    56      4  6  Great Expectations_23   joe     1      4  7  Great Expectations_15   joe    50      4  8  Great Expectations_18   joe    50      4  9   Great Expectations_9   joe    44      4  10 Great Expectations_13   joe    40      4   ... with 104,711 more rows  This  returns  a  tidy  data  frame  of  book-term  counts,  but  adds  an  extra  col‐ umn, .topic, with the topic each term was assigned to within each document.  Extra columns added by  augment always start with  . to prevent overwriting existing col‐ umns.  We can combine this assignments table with the consensus book titles to find which words were incorrectly classified.  assignments  %   separate document, c "title", "chapter" , sep = "_", convert = TRUE  %>%   inner_join book_topics, by = c ".topic" = "topic"    assignments    A tibble: 104,721 × 6                  title chapter  term count .topic          consensus                                               1  Great Expectations      57   joe    88      4 Great Expectations  2  Great Expectations       7   joe    70      4 Great Expectations  3  Great Expectations      17   joe     5      4 Great Expectations  4  Great Expectations      27   joe    58      4 Great Expectations  5  Great Expectations       2   joe    56      4 Great Expectations  6  Great Expectations      23   joe     1      4 Great Expectations  7  Great Expectations      15   joe    50      4 Great Expectations  8  Great Expectations      18   joe    50      4 Great Expectations  9  Great Expectations       9   joe    44      4 Great Expectations  10 Great Expectations      13   joe    40      4 Great Expectations   ... with 104,711 more rows  This combination of the true book  title  and the book assigned to it  consensus  is useful  for  further  exploration.  We  can,  for  example,  visualize  a  confusion  matrix, showing  how  often  words  from  one  book  were  assigned  to  another,  using  dplyr’s count   and ggplot2’s geom_tile  Figure 6-6 .  104      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling   assignments %>%   count title, consensus, wt = count  %>%   group_by title  %>%   mutate percent = n   sum n   %>%   ggplot aes consensus, title, fill = percent   +   geom_tile   +   scale_fill_gradient2 high = "red", label = percent_format    +   theme_minimal   +   theme axis.text.x = element_text angle = 90, hjust = 1 ,         panel.grid = element_blank    +   labs x = "Book words were assigned to",        y = "Book words came from",        fill = "% of assignments"   Figure 6-6. Confusion matrix showing where LDA assigned the words from each book. Each row of this table represents the true book each word came from, and each column represents what book it was assigned to.  We notice that almost all the words for Pride and Prejudice, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and The War of the Worlds were correctly assigned, while Great Expect‐ ations had a fair number of misassigned words  which, as we saw above, led to two chapters getting misclassified .

For some of these words, such as “love” and “lady,” that’s because they’re more common in Pride and Prejudice  we could confirm that by examining the counts . On the other hand, there are a few wrongly classified words that never appeared in the novel they were misassigned to. For example, we can confirm “flopson” appears only in Great Expectations, even though it’s assigned to the Pride and Prejudice cluster.  word_counts %>%   filter word == "flopson"     A tibble: 3 × 3                 document    word     n                             1 Great Expectations_22 flopson    10  2 Great Expectations_23 flopson     7  3 Great Expectations_33 flopson     1  The LDA algorithm is stochastic, and it can accidentally land on a topic that spans multiple books. Alternative LDA Implementations The  LDA   function in the topicmodels package is only one implementation of the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. For example, the mallet package  Mimno 2013  implements a wrapper around the MALLET Java package for text classification tools, and the tidytext package provides tidiers for this model output as well. The  mallet  package  takes  a  somewhat  different  approach  to  the  input  format.  For instance, it takes nontokenized documents and performs the tokenization itself, and requires a separate file of stop words. This means we have to collapse the text into one string for each document before performing LDA.  library mallet    create a vector with one string per chapter collapsed  %   anti_join stop_words, by = "word"  %>%   mutate word = str_replace word, "'", ""   %>%   group_by document  %>%   summarize text = paste word, collapse = " "     create an empty file of "stop words" file.create empty_file <- tempfile    docs <- mallet.import collapsed$document, collapsed$text, empty_file   mallet_model <- MalletLDA num.topics = 4  mallet_model$loadDocuments docs  mallet_model$train 100   Alternative LDA Implementations      107   Once the model is created, however, we can use the tidy   and augment   functions described in the rest of the chapter in an almost identical way. This includes extract‐ ing the probabilities of words within each topic or topics within each document.   word-topic pairs tidy mallet_model    document-topic pairs tidy mallet_model, matrix = "gamma"    column needs to be named "term" for "augment" term_counts <- rename word_counts, term = word  augment mallet_model, term_counts   We could use ggplot2 to explore and visualize the model in the same way we did the LDA output. Summary This chapter introduced topic modeling for finding clusters of words that character‐ ize a set of documents, and showed how the tidy   verb lets us explore and under‐ stand these models using dplyr and ggplot2. This is one of the advantages of the tidy approach to model exploration: the challenges of different output formats are han‐ dled by the tidying functions, and we can explore model results using a standard set of tools. In particular, we saw that topic modeling is able to separate and distinguish chapters from four separate books, and explored the limitations of the model by find‐ ing words and chapters that it assigned incorrectly.  108      Chapter 6: Topic Modeling   CHAPTER 7 Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives  One type of text that gets plenty of attention is text shared online via Twitter. In fact, several of the sentiment lexicons used in this book  and commonly used in general  were designed for use with and validated on tweets. Both authors of this book are on Twitter and are fairly regular users of it, so in this case study, let’s compare the entire Twitter archives of Julia and David. Getting the Data and Distribution of Tweets An individual can download his or her own Twitter archive by following directions available on Twitter’s website. We each downloaded ours and will now open them up. Let’s use the lubridate package to convert the string timestamps to date-time objects and initially take a look at our tweeting patterns overall  Figure 7-1 .  library lubridate  library ggplot2  library dplyr  library readr   tweets_julia <- read_csv "data tweets_julia.csv"  tweets_dave <- read_csv "data tweets_dave.csv"  tweets  %                       mutate person = "Julia" ,                     tweets_dave %>%                       mutate person = "David"   %>%   mutate timestamp = ymd_hms timestamp    ggplot tweets, aes x = timestamp, fill = person   +   geom_histogram position = "identity", bins = 20, show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~person, ncol = 1   109   Figure 7-1. All tweets from our accounts  David and Julia tweet at about the same rate currently and joined Twitter about a year apart from each other, but there were about five years where David was not active on Twitter and Julia was. In total, Julia has about four times as many tweets as David. Word Frequencies Let’s use unnest_tokens   to make a tidy data frame of all the words in our tweets, and remove the common English stop words. There are certain conventions in how people use text on Twitter, so we will do a bit more work with our text here than, for example, we did with the narrative text from Project Gutenberg. First, we will remove tweets from this dataset that are retweets so that we only have tweets that we wrote ourselves. Next, the mutate   line removes links and cleans out some characters that we don’t want, like ampersands and such.  110      Chapter 7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives   In the call to  unnest_tokens  , we unnest using a regex pattern, instead of just looking for single unigrams  words . This regex pat‐ tern is very useful for dealing with Twitter text; it retains hashtags and mentions of usernames with the @ symbol.  Because  we  have  kept  these  types  of  symbols  in  the  text,  we  can’t  use  a  simple anti_join   to remove stop words. Instead, we can take the approach shown in the filter   line that uses str_detect   from the stringr package.  library tidytext  library stringr   replace_reg1 <- "https:  t.co [A-Za-z\\d]+" replace_reg2 <- "http:  [A-Za-z\\d]+&amp;&lt;&gt;RThttps" replace_reg <- paste0 replace_reg1, replace_reg2  unnest_reg <- " [^A-Za-z_\\d@']' ?![A-Za-z_\\d@]  " tidy_tweets  %   filter !str_detect text, "^RT"   %>%   mutate text = str_replace_all text, replace_reg, ""   %>%   unnest_tokens word, text, token = "regex", pattern = unnest_reg  %>%   filter !word %in% stop_words$word,          str_detect word, "[a-z]"    Now we can calculate word frequencies for each person. First, we group by person and count how many times each person used each word. Then we use left_join   to add a column of the total number of words used by each person.  This is higher for Julia than David since she has more tweets than David.  Finally, we calculate a fre‐ quency for each person and word. frequency  %   group_by person  %>%   count word, sort = TRUE  %>%   left_join tidy_tweets %>%               group_by person  %>%               summarise total = n     %>%   mutate freq = n total   frequency   Source: local data frame [20,736 x 5]  Groups: person [2]      person           word     n total        freq                                1   Julia           time   584 74572 0.007831358  2   Julia    @selkie1970   570 74572 0.007643620  3   Julia       @skedman   531 74572 0.007120635  4   Julia            day   467 74572 0.006262404  5   Julia           baby   408 74572 0.005471222  6   David @hadleywickham   315 20161 0.015624225  7   Julia           love   304 74572 0.004076597  Word Frequencies      111    8   Julia   @haleynburke   299 74572 0.004009548  9   Julia          house   289 74572 0.003875449  10  Julia        morning   278 74572 0.003727941   ... with 20,726 more rows  This is a nice and tidy data frame, but we would actually like to plot those frequencies on the x- and y-axes of a plot, so we will need to use spread   from tidyr to make a differently shaped data frame.  library tidyr   frequency  %   select person, word, freq  %>%   spread person, freq  %>%   arrange Julia, David   frequency    A tibble: 17,640 × 3                 word        David        Julia                                     1                's 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  2  @accidental__art 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  3       @alice_data 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  4        @alistaire 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  5       @corynissen 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  6     @jennybryan's 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  7           @jsvine 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  8     @lizasperling 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  9        @ognyanova 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05  10       @rbloggers 4.960071e-05 1.340986e-05   ... with 17,630 more rows  Now this is ready for us to plot.

Comparing the frequency of words used by Julia and David  Words near the line in Figure 7-2 are used with about equal frequencies by David and Julia, while words far away from the line are used much more by one person com‐ pared to the other. Words, hashtags, and usernames that appear in this plot are ones that we have both used at least once in tweets. This may not even need to be pointed out, but David and Julia have used their Twitter accounts rather differently over the course of the past several years. David has used his  Twitter  account  almost  exclusively  for  professional  purposes  since  he  became more active, while Julia used it for entirely personal purposes until late 2015 and still uses it more personally than David. We see these differences immediately in this plot exploring word frequencies, and they will continue to be obvious in the rest of this chapter.  Word Frequencies      113   Comparing Word Usage We just made a plot comparing raw word frequencies over our whole Twitter histor‐ ies;  now  let’s  find  which  words  are  more  or  less  likely  to  come  from  each  person’s account using the log odds ratio. First, let’s restrict the analysis moving forward to tweets from David and Julia sent during 2016. David was consistently active on Twit‐ ter for all of 2016, and this was about when Julia transitioned into data science as a career.  tidy_tweets  %   filter timestamp >= as.Date "2016-01-01" ,          timestamp < as.Date "2017-01-01"    Next,  let’s  use  str_detect    to  remove  Twitter  usernames  from  the  word  column, because otherwise, the results here are dominated only by people who Julia or David know and the other does not. After removing these, we count how many times each person uses each word and keep only the words used more than 10 times. After a spread   operation, we can calculate the log odds ratio for each word, using:  log odds ratio = ln  n + 1 total+1 David n + 1 total+1 Julia  where n is the number of times the word in question is used by each person, and the total indicates the total words for each person.  What are some words that have been about equally likely to come from David’s or Julia’s account during 2016?  word_ratios  %   filter !str_detect word, "^@"   %>%   count word, person  %>%   filter sum n  >= 10  %>%   ungroup   %>%   spread person, n, fill = 0  %>%   mutate_if is.numeric, funs  . + 1    sum . + 1    %>%   mutate logratio = log David   Julia   %>%   arrange desc logratio    word_ratios %>%   arrange abs logratio      A tibble: 377 × 4           word       David       Julia    logratio                                     1         map 0.002321655 0.002314815 0.002950476  2       email 0.002110595 0.002083333 0.013000812  3        file 0.002110595 0.002083333 0.013000812  4       names 0.003799071 0.003703704 0.025423332  114      Chapter 7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives    5     account 0.001688476 0.001620370 0.041171689  6         api 0.001688476 0.001620370 0.041171689  7    function 0.003376952 0.003240741 0.041171689  8  population 0.001688476 0.001620370 0.041171689  9         sad 0.001688476 0.001620370 0.041171689  10      words 0.003376952 0.003240741 0.041171689   ... with 367 more rows  We are about equally likely to tweet about maps, email, APIs, and functions. Which words are most likely to be from Julia’s account or from David’s account? Let’s just  take  the  top  15  most  distinctive  words  for  each  account  and  plot  them  in Figure 7-3.  word_ratios %>%   group_by logratio  %   top_n 15, abs logratio   %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = reorder word, logratio   %>%   ggplot aes word, logratio, fill = logratio < 0   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   coord_flip   +   ylab "log odds ratio  David Julia "  +   scale_fill_discrete name = "", labels = c "David", "Julia"    Figure 7-3. Comparing the odds ratios of words from our accounts  Comparing Word Usage      115   So David has tweeted about specific conferences he has gone to, genes, Stack Over‐ flow, and matrices; while Julia tweeted about Utah, physics, Census data, Christmas, and her family. Changes in Word Use The section above looked at overall word use, but now let’s ask a different question. Which words’ frequencies have changed the fastest in our Twitter feeds? Or to state this another way, which words have we tweeted about at a higher or lower rate as time has  passed?  To  do  this,  we  will  define  a  new  time  variable  in  the  data  frame  that defines which unit of time each tweet was posted in. We can use floor_date   from lubridate to do this, with a unit of our choosing; using 1 month seems to work well for this year of tweets from both of us. After we have the time bins defined, we count how many times each of us used each word  in  each  time  bin.  After  that,  we  add  columns  to  the  data  frame  for  the  total number of words used in each time bin by each person and the total number of times each word was used by each person. We can then filter   to only keep words used at least some minimum number of times  30, in this case .  words_by_time  %   filter !str_detect word, "^@"   %>%   mutate time_floor = floor_date timestamp, unit = "1 month"   %>%   count time_floor, person, word  %>%   ungroup   %>%   group_by person, time_floor  %>%   mutate time_total = sum n   %>%   group_by word  %>%   mutate word_total = sum n   %>%   ungroup   %>%   rename count = n  %>%   filter word_total > 30   words_by_time    A tibble: 970 × 6     time_floor person    word count time_total word_total                                   1  2016-01-01  David rstats     2        307        324  2  2016-01-01  David     bad     1        307         33  3  2016-01-01  David     bit     2        307         45  4  2016-01-01  David    blog     1        307         60  5  2016-01-01  David   broom     2        307         41  6  2016-01-01  David    call     2        307         31  7  2016-01-01  David   check     1        307         42  8  2016-01-01  David    code     3        307         49  9  2016-01-01  David    data     2        307        276  10 2016-01-01  David     day     2        307         65   ... with 960 more rows  116      Chapter 7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives   Each row in this data frame corresponds to one person using one word in a given time bin. The count column tells us how many times that person used that word in that time bin, the time_total column tells us how many words that person used dur‐ ing that time bin, and the word_total column tells us how many times that person used that word over the whole year. This is the data set we can use for modeling. We can use nest   from tidyr to make a data frame with a list column that contains little miniature data frames for each word. Let’s do that now and take a look at the resulting structure.  nested_data  %   nest -word, -person   nested_data    A tibble: 112 × 3     person    word              data                          1   David rstats    2   David     bad     3   David     bit    4   David    blog    5   David   broom    6   David    call     7   David   check    8   David    code    9   David    data    10  David     day      ... with 102 more rows  This data frame has one row for each person-word combination; the data column is a list column that contains data frames, one for each combination of person and word. Let’s use  map   from the purrr library to apply our modeling procedure to each of those little data frames inside our big data frame. This is count data, so let’s use glm   with family = "binomial" for modeling.  library purrr   nested_models  %   mutate models = map data, ~ glm cbind count, time_total  ~ time_floor, .,                                   family = "binomial"     nested_models    A tibble: 112 × 4     person    word              data    models                               1   David rstats      2   David     bad       3   David     bit      4   David    blog      Changes in Word Use      117    5   David   broom      6   David    call       7   David   check      8   David    code      9   David    data      10  David     day        ... with 102 more rows  We can think about this modeling procedure answering questions like, “Was a given word mentioned in a given time bin? Yes or no? How does the count of word mentions depend on time?”  Now notice that we have a new column for the modeling results; it is another list col‐ umn and contains  glm objects. The next step is to use  map   and  tidy   from the broom package to pull out the slopes for each of these models and find the important ones. We are comparing many slopes here, and some of them are not statistically sig‐ nificant, so let’s apply an adjustment to the p-values for multiple comparisons.  library broom   slopes  %   unnest map models, tidy   %>%   filter term == "time_floor"  %>%   mutate adjusted.p.value = p.adjust p.value    top_slopes  %   filter adjusted.p.value  %   select -statistic, -p.value   top_slopes  Now let’s find the most important slopes. Which words have changed in frequency at a moderately significant level in our tweets?

Trending words in David’s tweets  We see in Figure 7-4 that David tweeted a lot about the UseR conference while he was there and then quickly stopped. He has tweeted more about Stack Overflow toward the end of the year and less about ggplot2 as the year has progressed. Now let’s plot words that have changed frequency in Julia’s tweets in Figure 7-5.  words_by_time %>%   inner_join top_slopes, by = c "word", "person"   %>%   filter person == "Julia"  %>%   ggplot aes time_floor, count time_total, color = word, lty = word   +   geom_line size = 1.3  +   labs x = NULL, y = "Word frequency"   Changes in Word Use      119   Figure 7-5. Trending words in Julia’s tweets  All the significant slopes for Julia are negative. This means she has not tweeted at a higher rate using any specific words, but instead used a variety of different words; her tweets earlier in the year contained the words shown in this plot at higher propor‐ tions. Words she uses when publicizing a new blog post, like the rstats hashtag and “post,” have gone down in frequency, and she has tweeted less about reading. Favorites and Retweets Another important characteristic of tweets is how many times they are favorited or retweeted. Let’s explore which words are more likely to be retweeted or favorited for Julia’s  and  David’s  tweets.  When  a  user  downloads  his  or  her  own  Twitter  archive, favorites  and  retweets  are  not  included,  so  we  constructed  another  dataset  of  the authors’ tweets that includes this information. We accessed our own tweets via the Twitter API and downloaded about 3,200 tweets for each person. In both cases, that is about the last 18 months worth of Twitter activity. This corresponds to a period of increasing activity and increasing numbers of followers for both of us.  tweets_julia <- read_csv "data juliasilge_tweets.csv"  tweets_dave <- read_csv "data drob_tweets.csv"  tweets  %                       mutate person = "Julia" ,                     tweets_dave %>%                       mutate person = "David"   %>%   mutate created_at = ymd_hms created_at    120      Chapter 7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives   Now  that  we  have  this  second,  smaller  set  of  only  recent  tweets,  let’s  use  unn est_tokens   to transform these tweets to a tidy data set. Let’s remove all retweets and replies from this data set so we only look at regular tweets that David and Julia have posted directly.  tidy_tweet %>%   select -source    filter !str_detect text, "^ RT@ "   %>%   mutate text = str_replace_all text, replace_reg, ""   %>%   unnest_tokens word, text, token = "regex", pattern = unnest_reg  %>%   anti_join stop_words   tidy_tweets    A tibble: 11,078 × 7               id          created_at retweets favorites person       word                                                   1  8.044026e+17 2016-12-01 19:11:43        1        15  David      worry  2  8.043967e+17 2016-12-01 18:48:07        4         6  David        j's  3  8.043611e+17 2016-12-01 16:26:39        8        12  David  bangalore  4  8.043611e+17 2016-12-01 16:26:39        8        12  David     london  5  8.043611e+17 2016-12-01 16:26:39        8        12  David developers  6  8.041571e+17 2016-12-01 02:56:10        0        11  Julia management  7  8.041571e+17 2016-12-01 02:56:10        0        11  Julia      julie  8  8.040582e+17 2016-11-30 20:23:14       30        41  David         sf  9  8.040324e+17 2016-11-30 18:40:27        0        17  Julia     zipped  10 8.040324e+17 2016-11-30 18:40:27        0        17  Julia         gb   ... with 11,068 more rows  To start with, let’s look at the number of times each of our tweets was retweeted. Let’s find the total number of retweets for each person.  totals  %   group_by person, id  %>%   summarise rts = sum retweets   %>%   group_by person  %>%   summarise total_rts = sum rts    totals    A tibble: 2 × 2    person total_rts              1  David    110171  2  Julia     12701  Now let’s find the median number of retweets for each word and person. We probably want to count each tweet word combination only once, so we will use  group_by   and  summarise    twice,  one  right  after  the  other.  The  first  summarise    statement counts how many times each word was retweeted, for each tweet and person. In the second summarise   statement, we can find the median retweets for each person and word, count the number of times each word was used by each person, and keep that  Favorites and Retweets      121   in uses. Next, we can join this to the data frame of retweet totals. Let’s filter   to only keep words mentioned at least five times.  word_by_rts  %   group_by id, word, person  %>%   summarise rts = first retweets   %>%   group_by person, word  %>%   summarise retweets = median rts , uses = n    %>%   left_join totals  %>%   filter retweets != 0  %>%   ungroup    word_by_rts %>%   filter uses >= 5  %>%   arrange desc retweets      A tibble: 178 × 5     person          word retweets  uses total_rts                                1   David     animation     85.0     5    110171  2   David      download     52.0     5    110171  3   David         start     51.0     7    110171  4   Julia      tidytext     50.0     7     12701  5   David     gganimate     45.0     8    110171  6   David   introducing     45.0     6    110171  7   David understanding     37.0     6    110171  8   David             0     35.0     7    110171  9   David         error     34.5     8    110171  10  David      bayesian     34.0     7    110171   ... with 168 more rows  At the top of this sorted data frame, we see tweets from Julia and David about pack‐ ages that they work on, like gutenbergr, gganimate, and tidytext. Let’s plot the words that have the highest median retweets for each of our accounts  Figure 7-6 .  word_by_rts %>%   filter uses >= 5  %>%   group_by person  %>%   top_n 10, retweets  %>%   arrange retweets  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = factor word, unique word    %>%   ungroup   %>%   ggplot aes word, retweets, fill = person   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ person, scales = "free", ncol = 2  +   coord_flip   +   labs x = NULL,        y = "Median  of retweets for tweets containing each word"   122      Chapter 7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives   Figure 7-6. Words with highest median retweets  We see lots of words about R packages, including tidytext, a package about which you are reading right now! The “0” for David comes from tweets where he mentions ver‐ sion numbers of packages, like “broom 0.4.0” or similar. We can follow a similar procedure to see which words led to more favorites. Are they different than the words that lead to more retweets?  totals  %   group_by person, id  %>%   summarise favs = sum favorites   %>%   group_by person  %>%   summarise total_favs = sum favs    word_by_favs  %   group_by id, word, person  %>%   summarise favs = first favorites   %>%   group_by person, word  %>%   summarise favorites = median favs , uses = n    %>%   left_join totals  %>%   filter favorites != 0  %>%   ungroup    word_by_favs %>%   filter uses >= 5  %>%   group_by person  %>%   top_n 10, favorites  %>%   arrange favorites  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = factor word, unique word    %>%  We  have  built  the  data  frames  we  need.  Now  let’s  make  our  visualization  in Figure 7-7.

Words with highest median favorites  We see some minor differences between Figures 7-6 and 7-7, especially near the bot‐ tom of the top 10 list, but these are largely the same words as for retweets. In general, the same words that lead to retweets lead to favorites. A prominent word for Julia in both plots is the hashtag for the NASA Datanauts program that she has participated in; read on to Chapter 8 to learn more about NASA data and what we can learn from text analysis of NASA datasets. Summary This chapter was our first case study, a beginning-to-end analysis that demonstrated how to bring together the concepts and code we have been exploring in a cohesive way  to  understand  a  text  data  set.  Comparing  word  frequencies  allowed  us  to  see which  words  we  tweeted  more  and  less  frequently,  and  the  log  odds  ratio  showed which words are more likely to be tweeted from each of our accounts. We can use nest   and  map   with the  glm   function to find which words we have tweeted at higher and lower rates as time has passed. Finally, we can find which words in our tweets led to higher numbers of retweets and favorites. All of these are examples of approaches to measure how we use words in similar and different ways, and how the characteristics of our tweets are changing or compare with each other. These are flex‐ ible approaches to text mining that can be applied to other types of text as well.  124      Chapter 7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives   CHAPTER 8 Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata  There  are  over  32,000  datasets  hosted  and or  maintained  by  NASA;  these  datasets cover topics from Earth science to aerospace engineering to management of NASA itself.  We  can  use  the  metadata  for  these  datasets  to  understand  the  connections between them.  What is metadata? Metadata is a term that refers to data that gives information  about  other  data;  in  this  case,  the  metadata  informs users about what is in these numerous NASA datasets but does not include the content of the datasets themselves.  The  metadata  includes  information  like  the  title  of  the  dataset,  a  description  field, what  organization s   within  NASA  is  responsible  for  the  dataset,  keywords  for  the dataset that have been assigned by a human being, and so forth. NASA places a high priority  on  making  its  data  open  and  accessible,  even  requiring  all  NASA-funded research to be openly accessible online. The metadata for all its datasets is publicly available online in JSON format. In this chapter, we will treat the NASA metadata as a text dataset and show how to implement several tidy text approaches with this real-life text. We will use word co- occurrences and correlations, tf-idf, and topic modeling to explore the connections between the datasets. Can we find datasets that are related to each other? Can we find clusters of similar datasets? Since we have several text fields in the NASA metadata, most importantly the title, description, and keyword fields, we can explore the con‐ nections between the fields to better understand the complex world of data at NASA. This type of approach can be extended to any domain that deals with text, so let’s take a look at this metadata and get started.  125   How Data Is Organized at NASA First, let’s download the JSON file and take a look at the names of what is stored in the metadata.  library jsonlite  metadata <- fromJSON "https:  data.nasa.gov data.json"  names metadata$dataset     [1] "_id"                "@type"              "accessLevel"   [4] "accrualPeriodicity" "bureauCode"         "contactPoint"   [7] "description"        "distribution"       "identifier"  [10] "issued"             "keyword"            "landingPage"  [13] "language"           "modified"           "programCode"  [16] "publisher"          "spatial"            "temporal"  [19] "theme"              "title"              "license"  [22] "isPartOf"           "references"         "rights"  [25] "describedBy"  We see here that we could extract information from who publishes each dataset to what license each dataset is released under. It seems likely that the title, description, and keywords for each dataset may be most fruitful for drawing connections between datasets. Let’s check them out.  class metadata$dataset$title    [1] "character"  class metadata$dataset$description    [1] "character"  class metadata$dataset$keyword    [1] "list"  The title and description fields are stored as character vectors, but the keywords are stored as a list of character vectors. Wrangling and Tidying the Data Let’s set up separate tidy data frames for title, description, and keyword, keeping the dataset IDs for each so that we can connect them later in the analysis if necessary.  library dplyr   nasa_title <- data_frame id = metadata$dataset$`_id`$`$oid`,                          title = metadata$dataset$title  nasa_title    A tibble: 32,089 × 2                           id                                              title                                                                          1  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a77             15 Minute Stream Flow Data: USGS  FIFE  126      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata    2  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a78             15 Minute Stream Flow Data: USGS  FIFE  3  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a79             15 Minute Stream Flow Data: USGS  FIFE  4  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7a 2000 Pilot Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI  5  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7b 2000 Pilot Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI  6  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7c 2000 Pilot Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI  7  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7d       2001 Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI  8  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7e       2001 Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI  9  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7f       2001 Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI  10 55942a58c63a7fe59b495a80       2001 Environmental Sustainability Index  ESI   ... with 32,079 more rows  These are just a few example titles from the datasets we will be exploring. Notice that we have the NASA-assigned IDs here, and also that there are duplicate titles on sepa‐ rate datasets.  nasa_desc <- data_frame id = metadata$dataset$`_id`$`$oid`,                         desc = metadata$dataset$description   nasa_desc %>%   select desc  %>%   sample_n 5     A tibble: 5 × 1    1 MODIS  or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer  is a key instrument  2                                          Fatigue Countermeasures: A Meta-Ana  3  Mobile communications systems require programmable embedded platforms that  4  The Doppler Aerosol WiNd  DAWN , a pulsed lidar, operated aboard a NASA DC-  5 MODIS  or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer  is a key instrument  Here we see the first part of several selected description fields from the metadata. Now we can build the tidy data frame for the keywords. For this one, we need to use unnest   from tidyr, because they are in a list-column.  library tidyr   nasa_keyword <- data_frame id = metadata$dataset$`_id`$`$oid`,                            keyword = metadata$dataset$keyword  %>%   unnest keyword   nasa_keyword    A tibble: 126,814 × 2                           id       keyword                                     1  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a77 EARTH SCIENCE  2  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a77   HYDROSPHERE  3  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a77 SURFACE WATER  4  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a78 EARTH SCIENCE  5  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a78   HYDROSPHERE  6  55942a57c63a7fe59b495a78 SURFACE WATER  7  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a79 EARTH SCIENCE  How Data Is Organized at NASA      127    8  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a79   HYDROSPHERE  9  55942a58c63a7fe59b495a79 SURFACE WATER  10 55942a58c63a7fe59b495a7a EARTH SCIENCE   ... with 126,804 more rows  This is a tidy data frame because we have one row for each keyword; this means we will have multiple rows for each dataset because a dataset can have more than one keyword. Now it is time to use tidytext’s unnest_tokens   for the title and description fields so we can do the text analysis. Let’s also remove stop words from the titles and descrip‐ tions. We will not remove stop words from the keywords, because those are short, human-assigned keywords like “RADIATION” or “CLIMATE INDICATORS.”  These are now in the tidy text format that we have been working with throughout this book, with one token  word, in this case  per row; let’s take a look before we move on in our analysis. nasa_title  library tidytext   nasa_title  %   unnest_tokens word, title  %>%   anti_join stop_words   nasa_desc  %   unnest_tokens word, desc  %>%   anti_join stop_words     A tibble: 210,914 × 2                           id         word                                    1  56d07ee5a759fdadc44e5923       marble  2  56d07ee5a759fdadc44e5923         epic  3  56d07c16a759fdadc44e5922       fitara  4  56d07c16a759fdadc44e5922         ocio  5  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5849 implementing  6  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5846     receding  7  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5846    recursive  8  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5840   complaints  9  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e583b        score  10 56cf5b00a759fdadc44e583a          fix   ... with 210,904 more rows  nasa_desc    A tibble: 2,677,811 × 2                           id            word                                       1  56d07c16a759fdadc44e5922          fitara  2  56d07c16a759fdadc44e5922            ocio  3  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e584a   degradation's  128      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata    4  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847         dchwp1s  5  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847        dchwp1sp  6  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847          dchwdp  7  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847         dchwsnf  8  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847         dchwssf  9  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847        bursting  10 56cf5b00a759fdadc44e5847 consequentially   ... with 2,677,801 more rows  Some Initial Simple Exploration What are the most common words in the NASA dataset titles?

We may want to remove digits and some “words” like “v1” from these data frames for many types of analyses; they are not too meaningful for most audiences.  We can do this by making a list of custom stop words and using anti_join    to  remove  them  from  the  data  frame,  just  like  we removed  the  default  stop  words  that  are  in  the  tidytext  package. This approach can be used in many instances and is a great tool to bear in mind.  my_stopwords <- data_frame word = c as.character 1:10 ,                                     "v1", "v03", "l2", "l3", "l4", "v5.2.0",                                     "v003", "v004", "v005", "v006", "v7"   nasa_title  %   anti_join my_stopwords  nasa_desc  %   anti_join my_stopwords   What are the most common keywords?  nasa_keyword %>%   group_by keyword  %>%   count sort = TRUE     A tibble: 1,774 × 2                     keyword     n                            1            EARTH SCIENCE 14362  2                  Project  7452  3               ATMOSPHERE  7321  4              Ocean Color  7268  5             Ocean Optics  7268  6                   Oceans  7268  7                completed  6452  8  ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR  3142  9                   OCEANS  2765  10            LAND SURFACE  2720   ... with 1,764 more rows  We likely want to change all of the keywords to either lower- or uppercase to get rid of duplicates like “OCEANS” and “Oceans.” Let’s do that here.  nasa_keyword  %   mutate keyword = toupper keyword    Word Co-ocurrences and Correlations As  a  next  step,  let’s  examine  which  words  commonly  occur  together  in  the  titles, descriptions, and keywords of NASA datasets, as described in Chapter 4. We can then  130      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   examine  word  networks  for  these  fields;  this  may  help  us  see,  for  example,  which datasets are related to each other. Networks of Description and Title Words We  can  use  pairwise_count    from  the  widyr  package  to  count  how  many  times each pair of words occurs together in a title or description field.  library widyr   title_word_pairs  %   pairwise_count word, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE   title_word_pairs    A tibble: 156,689 × 3      item1   item2     n               1  system project   796  2     lba     eco   683  3    airs    aqua   641  4   level    aqua   623  5   level    airs   612  6    aura     omi   607  7  global    grid   597  8  global   daily   574  9    data  boreas   551  10 ground     gpm   550   ... with 156,679 more rows  desc_word_pairs    A tibble: 10,889,084 × 3          item1      item2     n                      1        data     global  9864  2        data resolution  9302  3  instrument resolution  8189  4        data    surface  8180  5      global resolution  8139  6        data instrument  7994  7        data     system  7870  8  resolution      bands  7584  9        data      earth  7576  These are the pairs of words that occur together most often in title fields. Some of these words are obviously acronyms used within NASA, and we see how often words like “project” and “system” are used. desc_word_pairs  %   pairwise_count word, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE   Word Co-ocurrences and Correlations      131    10      orbit resolution  7462   ... with 10,889,074 more rows  These  are  the  pairs  of  words  that  occur  together  most  often  in  descripton  fields. “Data” is a very common word in description fields; there is no shortage of data in the datasets at NASA! Let’s plot networks of these co-occurring words so we can see these relationships bet‐ ter in Figure 8-1. We will again use the ggraph package for visualizing our networks.  library ggplot2  library igraph  library ggraph   set.seed 1234  title_word_pairs %>%   filter n >= 250  %>%   graph_from_data_frame   %>%   ggraph layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link aes edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n , edge_colour = "cyan4"  +   geom_node_point size = 5  +   geom_node_text aes label = name , repel = TRUE,                  point.padding = unit 0.2, "lines"   +   theme_void    Figure 8-1. Word network in NASA dataset titles  132      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   We see some clear clustering in this network of title words; words in NASA dataset titles are largely organized into several families of words that tend to go together. What about the words from the description fields  Figure 8-2 ?  set.seed 1234  desc_word_pairs %>%   filter n >= 5000  %>%   graph_from_data_frame   %>%   ggraph layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link aes edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n , edge_colour = "darkred"  +   geom_node_point size = 5  +   geom_node_text aes label = name , repel = TRUE,                  point.padding = unit 0.2, "lines"   +   theme_void    Figure 8-2. Word network in NASA dataset descriptions  Figure 8-2 shows such strong connections between the top dozen or so words  words like “data,” “global,” “resolution,” and “instrument”  that we do not see a clear cluster‐ ing  structure  in  the  network.  We  may  want  to  use  tf-idf   as  described  in  detail  in Chapter 3  as a metric to find characteristic words for each description field, instead of looking at counts of words.  Word Co-ocurrences and Correlations      133   Networks of Keywords Next, let’s make a network of the keywords in Figure 8-3 to see which keywords com‐ monly occur together in the same datasets.  keyword_pairs  %   pairwise_count keyword, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE   keyword_pairs    A tibble: 13,390 × 3             item1                   item2     n                                      1         OCEANS            OCEAN OPTICS  7324  2  EARTH SCIENCE              ATMOSPHERE  7318  3         OCEANS             OCEAN COLOR  7270  4   OCEAN OPTICS             OCEAN COLOR  7270  5        PROJECT               COMPLETED  6450  6  EARTH SCIENCE ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR  3142  7     ATMOSPHERE ATMOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR  3142  8  EARTH SCIENCE                  OCEANS  2762  9  EARTH SCIENCE            LAND SURFACE  2718  10 EARTH SCIENCE               BIOSPHERE  2448   ... with 13,380 more rows  set.seed 1234  keyword_pairs %>%   filter n >= 700  %>%   graph_from_data_frame   %>%   ggraph layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link aes edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n ,                  edge_colour = "royalblue"  +   geom_node_point size = 5  +   geom_node_text aes label = name , repel = TRUE,                  point.padding = unit 0.2, "lines"   +   theme_void    134      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Figure 8-3. Co-occurrence network in NASA dataset keywords  We  definitely  see  clustering  here,  and  strong  connections  between  keywords  like “OCEANS,” “OCEAN OPTICS,” and “OCEAN COLOR,” or “PROJECT” and “COM‐ PLETED.”  These  are  the  most  commonly  co-occurring  words,  but  also  just the most common keywords in general.  To examine the relationships among keywords in a different way, we can find the cor‐ relation  among  the  keywords  as  described  in  Chapter  4.  This  looks  for  those  key‐ words  that  are  more  likely  to  occur  together  than  with  other  keywords  in  a description field.  keyword_cors  %   group_by keyword  %>%   filter n   >= 50  %>%   pairwise_cor keyword, id, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE   Word Co-ocurrences and Correlations      135   keyword_cors    A tibble: 7,875 × 3                   item1       item2 correlation                                      1            KNOWLEDGE     SHARING   1.0000000  2             DASHLINK        AMES   1.0000000  3             SCHEDULE  EXPEDITION   1.0000000  4           TURBULENCE      MODELS   0.9971871  5                APPEL   KNOWLEDGE   0.9967945  6                APPEL     SHARING   0.9967945  7         OCEAN OPTICS OCEAN COLOR   0.9952123  8  ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE       CLOUD   0.9938681  9               LAUNCH    SCHEDULE   0.9837078  10              LAUNCH  EXPEDITION   0.9837078   ... with 7,865 more rows  Notice that these keywords at the top of this sorted data frame have correlation coeffi‐ cients equal to 1; they always occur together. This means these are redundant key‐ words. It may not make sense to continue to use both of the keywords in these sets of pairs; instead, just one keyword could be used. Let’s visualize the network of keyword correlations, just as we did for keyword co- occurences  Figure 8-4 .  set.seed 1234  keyword_cors %>%   filter correlation > .6  %>%   graph_from_data_frame   %>%   ggraph layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link aes edge_alpha = correlation, edge_width = correlation ,                  edge_colour = "royalblue"  +   geom_node_point size = 5  +   geom_node_text aes label = name , repel = TRUE,                  point.padding = unit 0.2, "lines"   +   theme_void    136      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Figure 8-4. Correlation network in NASA dataset keywords  This network in Figure 8-4 appears much different than the co-occurence network. The difference is that the co-occurrence network asks a question about which key‐ word  pairs  occur  most  often,  and  the  correlation  network  asks  a  question  about which keywords occur more often together than with other keywords. Notice here the high number of small clusters of keywords; the network structure can be extrac‐ ted  for further analysis  from the graph_from_data_frame   function above. Calculating tf-idf for the Description Fields The network graph in Figure 8-2 showed us that the description fields are dominated by a few common words like “data,” “global,” and “resolution”; this would be an excel‐ lent opportunity to use tf-idf as a statistic to find characteristic words for individual description fields. As discussed in Chapter 3, we can use tf-idf, the term frequency times inverse document frequency, to identify words that are especially important to a document within a collection of documents. Let’s apply that approach to the descrip‐ tion fields of these NASA datasets. What Is tf-idf for the Description Field Words? We will consider each description field a document, and the whole set of description fields the collection or corpus of documents. We have already used unnest_tokens    Calculating tf-idf for the Description Fields      137   earlier in this chapter to make a tidy data frame of the words in the description fields, so now we can use bind_tf_idf   to calculate tf-idf for each word.  desc_tf_idf  %   count id, word, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup   %>%   bind_tf_idf word, id, n   desc_tf_idf %>%   arrange -tf_idf  %>%   select -id   What are the highest tf-idf words in the NASA description fields?    A tibble: 1,913,224 × 6                                              word     n    tf       idf                                                          1                                            rdr     1     1 10.375052  2  palsar_radiometric_terrain_corrected_high_res     1     1 10.375052  3  cpalsar_radiometric_terrain_corrected_low_res     1     1 10.375052  4                                           lgrs     1     1  8.765615  5                                           lgrs     1     1  8.765615  6                                           lgrs     1     1  8.765615  7                                            mri     1     1  8.583293  8                       template_proddescription     1     1  8.295611  9                       template_proddescription     1     1  8.295611  10                      template_proddescription     1     1  8.295611   ... with 1,913,214 more rows, and 1 more variables: tf_idf    These are the most important words in the description fields as measured by tf-idf, meaning they are common but not too common.  Notice we have run into an issue here; both n and term frequency are equal to 1 for these terms, meaning that these were description fields  that  only  had  a  single  word  in  them.  If  a  description  field only contains one word, the tf-idf algorithm will think that is a very important word.  Depending on our analytic goals, it might be a good idea to throw out all description fields that have very few words. Connecting Description Fields to Keywords We  now  know  which  words  in  the  descriptions  have  high  tf-idf,  and  we  also  have labels for these descriptions in the keywords. Let’s do a full join of the keyword data frame and the data frame of description words with tf-idf, and then find the highest tf-idf words for a given keyword.  desc_tf_idf <- full_join desc_tf_idf, nasa_keyword, by = "id"   138      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Let’s plot some of the most important words, as measured by tf-idf, for a few example keywords used on NASA datasets. First, let’s use dplyr operations to filter for the key‐ words we want to examine and take just the top 15 words for each keyword. Then, let’s plot those words in Figure 8-5.  desc_tf_idf %>%   filter !near tf, 1   %>%   filter keyword %in% c "SOLAR ACTIVITY", "CLOUDS",                         "SEISMOLOGY", "ASTROPHYSICS",                         "HUMAN HEALTH", "BUDGET"   %>%   arrange desc tf_idf   %>%   group_by keyword  %>%   distinct word, keyword, .keep_all = TRUE  %>%   top_n 15, tf_idf  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = factor word, levels = rev unique word     %>%   ggplot aes word, tf_idf, fill = keyword   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~keyword, ncol = 3, scales = "free"  +   coord_flip   +   labs title = "Highest tf-idf words in NASA metadata description fields",        caption = "NASA metadata from https:  data.nasa.gov data.json",        x = NULL, y = "tf-idf"   Figure 8-5. Distribution of tf-idf for words from datasets labeled with select keywords  Calculating tf-idf for the Description Fields      139   Using tf-idf has allowed us to identify important description words for each of these keywords.  Datasets  labeled  with  the  keyword  “SEISMOLOGY”  have  words  like “earthquake,”  “risk,”  and  “hazard”  in  their  description,  while  those  labeled  with “HUMAN HEALTH” have descriptions characterized by words like “wellbeing,” “vul‐ nerability,” and “children.” Most of the combinations of letters that are not English words are certainly acronyms  like OMB for the Office of Management and Budget , and the examples of years and numbers are important for these topics. The tf-idf sta‐ tistic has identified the kinds of words it is intended to—important words for individ‐ ual documents within a collection of documents. Topic Modeling Using  tf-idf  as  a  statistic  has  already  given  us  insight  into  the  content  of  NASA description  fields,  but  let’s  try  an  additional  approach  to  the  question  of  what  the NASA  descriptions  fields  are  about.  We  can  use  topic  modeling,  as  described  in Chapter  6,  to  model  each  document   description  field   as  a  mixture  of  topics,  and each topic as a mixture of words. As in earlier chapters, we will use latent Dirichlet allocation   LDA   for  our  topic  modeling;  there  are  other  possible  approaches  for topic modeling. Casting to a Document-Term Matrix To do the topic modeling as implemented here, we need to make a DocumentTermMa trix, a special kind of matrix from the tm package  of course, this is just a specific implementation of the general concept of a “document-term matrix” . Rows corre‐ spond  to  documents   description  texts  in  our  case ,  and  columns  correspond  to terms  i.e., words ; it is a sparse matrix and the values are word counts. Let’s clean up the text a bit using stop words to remove some of the nonsense “words” left over from HTML or other character encoding. We can use bind_rows   to add our custom stop words to the list of default stop words from the tidytext package, and then use anti_join   to remove them all at once from our data frame.  my_stop_words <- bind_rows stop_words,                            data_frame word = c "nbsp", "amp", "gt", "lt",                                                "timesnewromanpsmt", "font",                                                "td", "li", "br", "tr", "quot",                                                "st", "img", "src", "strong",                                                "http", "file", "files",                                                as.character 1:12  ,                                       lexicon = rep "custom", 30     word_counts  %   anti_join my_stop_words  %>%   count id, word, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    140      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   word_counts    A tibble: 1,895,310 × 3                           id     word     n                                  1  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef     suit    82  2  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef    space    69  3  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     data    41  4  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     leak    40  5  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     tree    39  6  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef pressure    34  7  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef   system    34  8  55942a89c63a7fe59b4982d9       em    32  9  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef       al    32  10 55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef    human    31   ... with 1,895,300 more rows  This is the information we need, the number of times each word is used in each docu‐ ment, to make a  DocumentTermMatrix. We can  cast   from our tidy text format to this nontidy format, as described in detail in Chapter 5.  desc_dtm  %   cast_dtm id, word, n   desc_dtm    >  Non- sparse entries: 1895310 1147044393  Sparsity           : 100%  Maximal term length: 166  Weighting          : term frequency  tf   We see that this dataset contains documents  each of them a NASA description field  and terms  words . Notice that this example document-term matrix is  very close to  100% sparse, meaning that almost all of the entries in this matrix are zero. Each non- zero entry corresponds to a certain word appearing in a certain document. Ready for Topic Modeling Now let’s use the topicmodels package to create an LDA model. How many topics will we tell the algorithm to make? This is a question much like in k-means clustering; we don’t really know ahead of time. We tried the following modeling procedure using 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 topics; we found that at 24 topics, documents are still getting sorted into  topics  cleanly,  but  going  much  beyond  that  caused  the  distributions  of  γ,  the probability  that  each  document  belongs  in  each  topic,  to  look  worrisome.  We  will show more details on this later.  Topic Modeling      141   library topicmodels    be aware that running this model is time intensive desc_lda <- LDA desc_dtm, k = 24, control = list seed = 1234   desc_lda   A LDA_VEM topic model with 24 topics.  This is a stochastic algorithm that could have different results depending on where the algorithm starts, so we need to specify a seed for reproducibility as shown here. Interpreting the Topic Model Now that we have built the model, let’s tidy   the results of the model, i.e., construct a  tidy  data  frame  that  summarizes  the  results  of  the  model.  The  tidytext  package includes a tidying method for LDA models from the topicmodels package.  tidy_lda <- tidy desc_lda   tidy_lda    A tibble: 861,624 × 3     topic  term          beta                    1      1  suit 1.003981e-121  2      2  suit 2.630614e-145  3      3  suit  1.916240e-79  4      4  suit  6.715725e-45  5      5  suit  1.738334e-85  6      6  suit  7.692116e-84  7      7  suit  3.283851e-04  8      8  suit  3.738586e-20  9      9  suit  4.846953e-15  10    10  suit  4.765471e-10   ... with 861,614 more rows  top_terms  %   group_by topic  %>%   top_n 10, beta  %>%   ungroup   %>%   arrange topic, -beta   top_terms    A tibble: 240 × 3     topic        term       beta                       142      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata  The column β tells us the probability of that term being generated from that topic for that  document.  It  is  the  probability  of  that  term   word   belonging  to  that  topic. Notice that some of the values for β are very, very low, and some are not so low. What is each topic about? Let’s examine the top 10 terms for each topic.    1      1        data 0.04488960  2      1        soil 0.03676198  3      1    moisture 0.02954555  4      1        amsr 0.02437751  5      1         sst 0.01684001  6      1  validation 0.01322457  7      1 temperature 0.01317075  8      1     surface 0.01290046  9      1    accuracy 0.01225131  10     1         set 0.01155372   ... with 230 more rows  It is not very easy to interpret what the topics are about from a data frame like this, so let’s look at this information visually in Figures 8-6 and 8-7.  top_terms %>%   mutate term = reorder term, beta   %>%   group_by topic, term  %>%   arrange desc beta   %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate term = factor paste term, topic, sep = "__" ,                        levels = rev paste term, topic, sep = "__"     %>%   ggplot aes term, beta, fill = as.factor topic    +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   coord_flip   +   scale_x_discrete labels = function x  gsub "__.+$", "", x   +   labs title = "Top 10 terms in each LDA topic",        x = NULL, y = expression beta   +   facet_wrap ~ topic, ncol = 3, scales = "free"   Topic Modeling      143   Figure 8-6. Top terms in topic modeling of NASA metadata description field texts  144      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Figure 8-7. Top terms in topic modeling of NASA metadata description field texts  Topic Modeling      145   We can see what a dominant word “data” is in these description texts. In addition, there  are  meaningful  differences  between  these  collections  of  terms,  from  terms about soil, forests, and biomass in topic 12 to terms about design, systems, and tech‐ nology in topic 21. The topic modeling process has identified groupings of terms that we can understand as human readers of these description fields. We just explored which words are associated with which topics. Next, let’s examine which topics are associated with which description fields  i.e., documents . We will look at a different probability for this, γ, the probability that each document belongs in each topic, again using the tidy verb.  lda_gamma <- tidy desc_lda, matrix = "gamma"   lda_gamma    A tibble: 768,072 × 3                     document topic        gamma                                      1  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef     1 6.453820e-06  2  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     1 1.158393e-05  3  55942a89c63a7fe59b4982d9     1 4.917441e-02  4  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e55cd     1 2.249043e-05  5  55942a89c63a7fe59b4982c6     1 6.609442e-05  6  55942a86c63a7fe59b498077     1 5.666520e-05  7  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e56f8     1 4.752082e-05  8  55942a8bc63a7fe59b4984b5     1 4.308534e-05  9  55942a6ec63a7fe59b496bf7     1 4.408626e-05  10 55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986f6     1 2.878188e-05   ... with 768,062 more rows  Notice that some of the probabilities visible at the top of the data frame are low and some are higher. Our model has assigned a probability to each description belonging to each of the topics we constructed from the sets of words. How are the probabilities distributed? Let’s visualize them  Figure 8-8 .  ggplot lda_gamma, aes gamma   +   geom_histogram   +   scale_y_log10   +   labs title = "Distribution of probabilities for all topics",        y = "Number of documents", x = expression gamma    146      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Figure 8-8. Probability distribution in topic modeling of NASA metadata description field texts  First notice that the y-axis is plotted on a log scale; otherwise it is difficult to make out any detail in the plot. Next, notice that γ runs from 0 to 1; remember that this is the probability that a given document belongs in a given topic. There are many values near zero, which means there are many documents that do not belong in each topic. Also, there are many values near γ = 1; these are the documents that do belong in those topics. This distribution shows that documents are being well discriminated as belonging to a topic or not. We can also look at how the probabilities are distributed within each topic, as shown in Figure 8-9.  ggplot lda_gamma, aes gamma, fill = as.factor topic    +   geom_histogram show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ topic, ncol = 4  +   scale_y_log10   +   labs title = "Distribution of probability for each topic",        y = "Number of documents", x = expression gamma    Topic Modeling      147   Figure 8-9. Probability distribution for each topic in topic modeling of NASA metadata description field texts  Let’s look specifically at topic 18 in Figure 8-9, a topic that had documents cleanly sorted in and out of it. There are many documents with γ close to 1; these are the documents that do belong to topic 18 according to the model. There are also many documents with γ close to 0; these are the documents that do not belong to topic 18.  148      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Each document appears in each panel in this plot, and its γ for that topic tells us that document’s probability of belonging in that topic. This plot displays the type of information we used to choose the number of topics for our topic modeling procedure. When we tried options higher than 24  such as 32 or 64 , the distributions for γ started to look very flat toward γ = 1; documents were not getting sorted into topics very well. Connecting Topic Modeling with Keywords Let’s connect these topic models with the keywords and see what relationships we can find. We can  full_join   this to the human-tagged keywords and discover which keywords are associated with which topic.  lda_gamma <- full_join lda_gamma, nasa_keyword, by = c "document" = "id"    lda_gamma    A tibble: 3,037,671 × 4                     document topic        gamma                     keyword                                                              1  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef     1 6.453820e-06        JOHNSON SPACE CENTER  2  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef     1 6.453820e-06                     PROJECT  3  55942a8ec63a7fe59b4986ef     1 6.453820e-06                   COMPLETED  4  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     1 1.158393e-05                    DASHLINK  5  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     1 1.158393e-05                        AMES  6  56cf5b00a759fdadc44e564a     1 1.158393e-05                        NASA  7  55942a89c63a7fe59b4982d9     1 4.917441e-02 GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER  8  55942a89c63a7fe59b4982d9     1 4.917441e-02                     PROJECT  9  55942a89c63a7fe59b4982d9     1 4.917441e-02                   COMPLETED  10 56cf5b00a759fdadc44e55cd     1 2.249043e-05                    DASHLINK   ... with 3,037,661 more rows  Now we can use filter   to keep only the document-topic entries that have proba‐ bilities  γ  greater than some cutoff value; let’s use 0.9.  top_keywords  %   filter gamma > 0.9  %>%   count topic, keyword, sort = TRUE   top_keywords   Source: local data frame [1,022 x 3]  Groups: topic [24]      topic       keyword     n                    1     13   OCEAN COLOR  4480  2     13  OCEAN OPTICS  4480  3     13        OCEANS  4480  4     11   OCEAN COLOR  1216  5     11  OCEAN OPTICS  1216  Topic Modeling      149    6     11        OCEANS  1216  7      9       PROJECT   926  8     12 EARTH SCIENCE   909  9      9     COMPLETED   834  10    16   OCEAN COLOR   768   ... with 1,012 more rows  What are the top keywords for each topic  Figure 8-10 ?  top_keywords %>%   group_by topic  %>%   top_n 5, n  %>%   group_by topic, keyword  %>%   arrange desc n   %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate keyword = factor paste keyword, topic, sep = "__" ,                           levels = rev paste keyword, topic, sep = "__"     %>%   ggplot aes keyword, n, fill = as.factor topic    +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   labs title = "Top keywords for each LDA topic",        x = NULL, y = "Number of documents"  +   coord_flip   +   scale_x_discrete labels = function x  gsub "__.+$", "", x   +   facet_wrap ~ topic, ncol = 3, scales = "free"   150      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   Figure 8-10. Top keywords in topic modeling of NASA metadata description field texts  Topic Modeling      151   Let’s take a step back and remind ourselves what Figure 8-10 is telling us. NASA data‐ sets  are  tagged  with  keywords  by  human  beings,  and  we  have  built  an  LDA  topic model   with  24  topics   for  the  description  fields  of  the  NASA  datasets.  This  plot answers the question, “For the datasets with description fields that have a high proba‐ bility of belonging to a given topic, what are the most common human-assigned key‐ words?” It’s interesting that the keywords for topics 13, 16, and 18 are essentially duplicates of each  other   “OCEAN  COLOR,”  “OCEAN  OPTICS,”  “OCEANS” ,  because  the  top words in those topics do exhibit meaningful differences, as shown in Figures 8-6 and 8-7. Also note that by number of documents, the combination of 13, 16, and 18 is quite a large percentage of the total number of datasets represented in this plot, and even  more  if  we  were  to  include  topic  11.  By  number,  there  are  many  datasets  at NASA that deal with oceans, ocean color, and ocean optics. We see “PROJECT COM‐ PLETED” in topics 9, 10, and 21, along with the names of NASA laboratories and research centers. Other important subject areas that stand out are groups of keywords about atmospheric science, budget finance, and population human dimensions. We can go back to Figures 8-6 and 8-7 on terms and topics to see which words in the description  fields  are  driving  datasets  being  assigned  to  these  topics.  For  example, topic  4  is  associated  with  keywords  about  population  and  human  dimensions,  and some  of  the  top  terms  for  that  topic  are  “population,”  “international,”  “center,”  and “university.” Summary By using a combination of network analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling, we have come to a greater understanding of how datasets are related at NASA. Specifically, we have more information now about how keywords are connected to each other and which datasets are likely to be related. The topic model could be used to suggest keywords based on the words in the description field, or the work on the keywords could sug‐ gest the most important combination of keywords for certain areas of study.  152      Chapter 8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata   CHAPTER 9 Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text  In our final chapter, we’ll use what we’ve learned in this book to perform a start-to- finish analysis of a set of 20,000 messages sent to 20 Usenet bulletin boards in 1993. The Usenet bulletin boards in this dataset include newsgroups for topics like politics, religion, cars, sports, and cryptography, and offer a rich set of text written by many users.  This  data  set  is  publicly  available  at  http:  qwone.com ~jason 20Newsgroups   the 20news-bydate.tar.gz file  and has become popular for exercises in text analysis and machine learning. Preprocessing We’ll start by reading in all the messages from the 20news-bydate folder, which are organized in subfolders with one file for each message. We can read in files like these with a combination of read_lines  , map  , and unnest  .  Note that this step may take several minutes to read all the docu‐ ments.  library dplyr  library tidyr  library purrr  library readr   training_folder <- "data 20news-bydate 20news-bydate-train "   Define a function to read all files from a folder into a data frame read_folder <- function infolder  {   data_frame file = dir infolder, full.names = TRUE   %>%  153       mutate text = map file, read_lines   %>%     transmute id = basename file , text  %>%     unnest text  }   Use unnest   and map   to apply read_folder to each subfolder raw_text  %   unnest map folder, read_folder   %>%   transmute newsgroup = basename folder , id, text   raw_text   A tibble: 511,655 x 3      newsgroup    id               1 alt.atheism 49960  2 alt.atheism 49960  3 alt.atheism 49960  4 alt.atheism 49960  5 alt.atheism 49960  6 alt.atheism 49960  7 alt.atheism 49960  8 alt.atheism 49960  9 alt.atheism 49960 10 alt.atheism 49960  ... with 511,645 more rows, and 1 more variables: text    Notice  the  newsgroup  column,  which  describes  which  of  the  20  newsgroups  each message comes from, and the  id column, which identifies a unique message within that newsgroup. What newsgroups are included, and how many messages were pos‐ ted in each  Figure 9-1 ?  library ggplot2   raw_text %>%   group_by newsgroup  %>%   summarize messages = n_distinct id   %>%   ggplot aes newsgroup, messages   +   geom_col   +   coord_flip    154      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   Figure 9-1. Number of messages from each newsgroup  We can see that Usenet newsgroup names are named hierarchically, starting with a main topic such as “talk,” “sci,” or “rec,” followed by further specifications. Preprocessing Text Most  of  the  datasets  we’ve  examined  in  this  book  were  preprocessed,  meaning  we didn’t have to remove, for example, copyright notices from the Jane Austen novels. Here, however, each message has some structure and extra text that we don’t want to include in our analysis. For example, every message has a header containing fields such as “from:” or “in_reply_to:” that describe the message. Some also have automa‐ ted email signatures, which occur after a line like --. This kind of preprocessing can be done within the dplyr package, using a combina‐ tion of cumsum    cumulative sum  and str_detect   from stringr.  library stringr    must occur after the first occurrence of an empty line,  and before the first occurrence of a line starting with -- cleaned_text  %   group_by newsgroup, id  %>%   filter cumsum text == ""  > 0,          cumsum str_detect text, "^--"   == 0  %>%   ungroup    Many lines also have nested text representing quotes from other users, typically start‐ ing  with  a  line  like  “so-and-so  writes…”  These  can  be  removed  with  a  few  regular expressions.  Preprocessing      155   We also choose to manually remove two messages, 9704 and 9985, that contain a large amount of nontext content.  cleaned_text  %   filter str_detect text, "^[^>]+[A-Za-z\\d]"   text == "",          !str_detect text, "writes :\\.\\.\\. $" ,          !str_detect text, "^In article <" ,          !id %in% c 9704, 9985    At  this  point,  we’re  ready  to  use  unnest_tokens    to  split  the  dataset  into  tokens, while removing stop words.  library tidytext   usenet_words  %   unnest_tokens word, text  %>%   filter str_detect word, "[a-z']$" ,          !word %in% stop_words$word   Every raw text dataset will require different steps for data cleaning, which will often involve  some  trial  and  error,  and  exploration  of  unusual  cases  in  the  dataset.  It’s important to notice that this cleaning can be achieved using tidy tools such as dplyr and tidyr. Words in Newsgroups Now that we’ve removed the headers, signatures, and formatting, we can start explor‐ ing common words. For starters, we could find the most common words in the entire dataset or within particular newsgroups.  usenet_words %>%   count word, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 68,137 × 2            word     n                1       people  3655  2         time  2705  3          god  1626  4       system  1595  5      program  1103  6          bit  1097  7  information  1094  8      windows  1088  9   government  1084  10       space  1072   ... with 68,127 more rows  156      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   words_by_newsgroup  %   count newsgroup, word, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup    words_by_newsgroup    A tibble: 173,913 × 3                   newsgroup      word     n                                  1   soc.religion.christian       god   917  2                sci.space     space   840  3    talk.politics.mideast    people   728  4                sci.crypt       key   704  5  comp.os.ms-windows.misc   windows   625  6    talk.politics.mideast  armenian   582  7                sci.crypt        db   549  8    talk.politics.mideast   turkish   514  9                rec.autos       car   509  10   talk.politics.mideast armenians   509   ... with 173,903 more rows  Finding tf-idf Within Newsgroups We’d expect the newsgroups to differ in terms of topic and content, and therefore for the frequency of words to differ between them. Let’s try quantifying this using the tf- idf metric  Chapter 3 .  tf_idf  %   bind_tf_idf word, newsgroup, n  %>%   arrange desc tf_idf    tf_idf   A tibble: 173,913 x 6                   newsgroup           word     n         tf     idf                                                  1 comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware           scsi   483 0.01761681 1.20397  2    talk.politics.mideast       armenian   582 0.00804890 2.30259  3          rec.motorcycles           bike   324 0.01389842 1.20397  4    talk.politics.mideast      armenians   509 0.00703933 2.30259  5                sci.crypt     encryption   410 0.00816099 1.89712  6         rec.sport.hockey            nhl   157 0.00439665 2.99573  7       talk.politics.misc stephanopoulos   158 0.00416228 2.99573  8          rec.motorcycles          bikes    97 0.00416095 2.99573  9         rec.sport.hockey         hockey   270 0.00756112 1.60944 10           comp.windows.x          oname   136 0.00353550 2.99573  ... with 173,903 more rows, and 1 more variables: tf_idf    We can examine the top tf-idf for a few selected groups to extract words specific to those  topics.  For  example,  we  could  look  at  all  the  sci.  boards,  visualized  in Figure 9-2.  Words in Newsgroups      157   tf_idf %>%   filter str_detect newsgroup, "^sci\\."   %>%   group_by newsgroup  %>%   top_n 12, tf_idf  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word = reorder word, tf_idf   %>%   ggplot aes word, tf_idf, fill = newsgroup   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ newsgroup, scales = "free"  +   ylab "tf-idf"  +   coord_flip    Figure 9-2. The 12 terms with the highest tf-idf within each of the science-related news‐ groups  We see lots of characteristic words specific to a particular newsgroup, such as “wir‐ ing” and “circuit” on the sci.electronics topic, and “orbit” and “lunar” for the space newsgroup. You could use this same code to explore other newsgroups yourself.  158      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   What newsgroups tend to be similar to each other in text content? We could discover this by finding the pairwise correlation of word frequencies within each newsgroup, using  the  pairwise_cor    function  from  the  widyr  package   see  “Examining  Pair‐ wise Correlation” on page 63 .  library widyr   newsgroup_cors  newsgroup_cors  %   pairwise_cor newsgroup, word, n, sort = TRUE     A tibble: 380 × 3                        item1                    item2 correlation                                                        1        talk.religion.misc   soc.religion.christian   0.8347275  2    soc.religion.christian       talk.religion.misc   0.8347275  3               alt.atheism       talk.religion.misc   0.7793079  4        talk.religion.misc              alt.atheism   0.7793079  5               alt.atheism   soc.religion.christian   0.7510723  6    soc.religion.christian              alt.atheism   0.7510723  7     comp.sys.mac.hardware comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware   0.6799043  8  comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware    comp.sys.mac.hardware   0.6799043  9        rec.sport.baseball         rec.sport.hockey   0.5770378  10         rec.sport.hockey       rec.sport.baseball   0.5770378   ... with 370 more rows  library ggraph  library igraph  set.seed 2017   newsgroup_cors %>%   filter correlation > .4  %>%   graph_from_data_frame   %>%   ggraph layout = "fr"  +   geom_edge_link aes alpha = correlation, width = correlation   +   geom_node_point size = 6, color = "lightblue"  +   geom_node_text aes label = name , repel = TRUE  +   theme_void    We could then filter for stronger correlations among newsgroups and visualize them in a network  Figure 9-3 .  Words in Newsgroups      159   Figure 9-3. A network of Usenet groups based on the correlation of word counts between them, including only connections with a correlation greater than 0.4  It looks like there are four main clusters of newsgroups: computers electronics, poli‐ tics religion, motor vehicles, and sports. This certainly makes sense in terms of what words and topics we’d expect these newsgroups to have in common. Topic Modeling In Chapter 6, we used the latent Dirichlet allocation  LDA  algorithm to divide a set of chapters into the books they originally came from. Could LDA do the same to sort out Usenet messages that come from different newsgroups? Let’s  try  dividing  up  messages  from  the  four  science-related  newsgroups.  We  first process  these  into  a  document-term  matrix  with  cast_dtm     “Casting  Tidy  Text Data into a Matrix” on page 77 , then fit the model with the LDA   function from the topicmodels package.   include only words that occur at least 50 times word_sci_newsgroups  %  160      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text     filter str_detect newsgroup, "^sci"   %>%   group_by word  %>%   mutate word_total = n    %>%   ungroup   %>%   filter word_total > 50    convert into a document-term matrix  with document names such as sci.crypt_14147 sci_dtm  %   unite document, newsgroup, id  %>%   count document, word  %>%   cast_dtm document, word, n   library topicmodels  sci_lda <- LDA sci_dtm, k = 4, control = list seed = 2016    What  four  topics  did  this  model  extract,  and  do  they  match  the  four  newsgroups? This approach will look familiar from Chapter 6: we visualize each topic based on the most frequent terms within it  Figure 9-4 .  sci_lda %>%   tidy   %>%   group_by topic  %>%   top_n 8, beta  %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate term = reorder term, beta   %>%   ggplot aes term, beta, fill = factor topic    +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ topic, scales = "free_y"  +   coord_flip    Figure 9-4. The top eight words from each topic fit by LDA on the science-related news‐ groups  Words in Newsgroups      161   From the top words, we can start to suspect which topics may capture which news‐ groups. Topic 1 certainly represents the sci.space newsgroup  thus the most common word being “space” , and topic 2 is likely drawn from cryptography, with terms such as “key” and “encryption.” Just as we did in “Document-Topic Probabilities” on page 95, we can confirm this by seeing how documents from each newsgroup have higher “gamma” for each topic  Figure 9-5 .  sci_lda %>%   tidy matrix = "gamma"  %>%   separate document, c "newsgroup", "id" , sep = "_"  %>%   mutate newsgroup = reorder newsgroup, gamma * topic   %>%   ggplot aes factor topic , gamma   +   geom_boxplot   +   facet_wrap ~ newsgroup  +   labs x = "Topic",        y = " of messages where this was the highest % topic"   Figure 9-5. Distribution of gamma for each topic within each Usenet newsgroup  Much as we saw in the literature analysis, topic modeling was able to discover the dis‐ tinct topics present in the text without needing to consult the labels. Notice that the division of Usenet messages isn’t as clean as the division of book chap‐ ters, with a substantial number of messages from each newsgroup getting high values of  “gamma”  for  other  topics.  This  isn’t  surprising  since  many  of  the  messages  are short  and  could  overlap  in  terms  of  common  words   for  example,  discussions  of space travel could include many of the same words as discussions of electronics . This is a realistic example of how LDA might divide documents into rough topics while still allowing a degree of overlap.  162      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   Sentiment Analysis We can use the sentiment analysis techniques we explored in Chapter 2 to examine how  often  positive  and  negative  words  occur  in  these  Usenet  posts.  Which  news‐ groups are the most positive or negative overall? In this example we’ll use the AFINN sentiment lexicon, which provides numeric posi‐ tivity scores for each word, and visualize it with a bar plot  Figure 9-6 .  newsgroup_sentiments  %   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn" , by = "word"  %>%   group_by newsgroup  %>%   summarize score = sum score * n    sum n    newsgroup_sentiments %>%   mutate newsgroup = reorder newsgroup, score   %>%   ggplot aes newsgroup, score, fill = score > 0   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   coord_flip   +   ylab "Average sentiment score"   Figure 9-6. Average AFINN score for posts within each newsgroup  Sentiment Analysis      163   According  to  this  analysis,  the  misc.forsale  newsgroup  is  the  most  positive.  This makes sense, since it likely includes many positive adjectives about the products that users want to sell! Sentiment Analysis by Word It’s worth looking deeper to understand why some newsgroups end up more positive or negative than others. For that, we can examine the total positive and negative con‐ tributions of each word.  contributions  %   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn" , by = "word"  %>%   group_by word  %>%   summarize occurences = n  ,             contribution = sum score    contributions    A tibble: 1,909 × 3          word occurences contribution                            1    abandon         13          -26  2  abandoned         19          -38  3   abandons          3           -6  4  abduction          2           -4  5      abhor          4          -12  6   abhorred          1           -3  7  abhorrent          2           -6  8  abilities         16           32  9    ability        177          354  10    aboard          8            8   ... with 1,899 more rows  Which words have the most effect on sentiment scores overall  Figure 9-7 ?  contributions %>%   top_n 25, abscontribution  %>%   mutate word = reorder word, contribution   %>%   ggplot aes word, contribution, fill = contribution > 0   +   geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   coord_flip    164      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   Figure 9-7. Words with the greatest contributions to positive negative sentiment scores in the Usenet text  These words look generally reasonable as indicators of each message’s sentiment, but we can spot possible problems with the approach. “True” could just as easily be a part of “not true” or a similar negative expression, and the words “God” and “Jesus” are apparently very common on Usenet but could easily be used in many contexts, posi‐ tive or negative. We may also care about which words contribute the most within each newsgroup, so that we can see which newsgroups might be incorrectly estimated. We can calculate each  word’s  contribution  to  each  newsgroup’s  sentiment  score,  and  visualize  the strongest contributors from a selection of the groups  Figure 9-8 .  top_sentiment_words  %   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn" , by = "word"  %>%   mutate contribution = score * n   sum n    top_sentiment_words    A tibble: 13,063 × 5                  newsgroup   word     n score contribution  Sentiment Analysis      165                                           1  soc.religion.christian    god   917     1  0.014418012  2  soc.religion.christian  jesus   440     1  0.006918130  3      talk.politics.guns    gun   425    -1 -0.006682285  4      talk.religion.misc    god   296     1  0.004654015  5             alt.atheism    god   268     1  0.004213770  6  soc.religion.christian  faith   257     1  0.004040817  7      talk.religion.misc  jesus   256     1  0.004025094  8   talk.politics.mideast killed   202    -3 -0.009528152  9   talk.politics.mideast    war   187    -2 -0.005880411  10 soc.religion.christian   true   179     2  0.005628842   ... with 13,053 more rows  Figure 9-8. The 12 words that contributed the most to sentiment scores within each of 6 newsgroups  166      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   This confirms our hypothesis about the misc.forsale newsgroup: most of the senti‐ ment is driven by positive adjectives such as “excellent” and “perfect.” We can also see how  much  sentiment  is  confounded  with  topic.  An  atheism  newsgroup  is  likely  to discuss “god” in detail even in a negative context, and we can see that it makes the newsgroup look more positive. Similarly, the negative contribution of the word “gun” to the talk.politics.guns group will occur even when the members are discussing guns positively. This helps remind us that sentiment analysis can be confounded by topic, and that we should  always  examine  the  influential  words  before  interpreting  the  analysis  too deeply. Sentiment Analysis by Message We can also try finding the most positive and negative individual messages by group‐ ing and summarizing by id rather than newsgroup.  sentiment_messages  %   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn" , by = "word"  %>%   group_by newsgroup, id  %>%   summarize sentiment = mean score ,             words = n    %>%   ungroup   %>%   filter words >= 5   As a simple measure to reduce the role of randomness, we filtered out  messages  that  had  fewer  than  five  words  that  contributed  to sentiment.  What were the most positive messages?  sentiment_messages %>%   arrange desc sentiment      A tibble: 3,554 × 4                   newsgroup     id sentiment words                                     1         rec.sport.hockey  53560  3.888889    18  2         rec.sport.hockey  53602  3.833333    30  3         rec.sport.hockey  53822  3.833333     6  4         rec.sport.hockey  53645  3.230769    13  5                rec.autos 102768  3.200000     5  6             misc.forsale  75965  3.000000     5  7             misc.forsale  76037  3.000000     5  8       rec.sport.baseball 104458  3.000000    11  9         rec.sport.hockey  53571  3.000000     5  10 comp.os.ms-windows.misc   9620  2.857143     7   ... with 3,544 more rows  Sentiment Analysis      167   Let’s check this by looking at the most positive message in the whole dataset.

Andrew--  Well, we can confidently say that the sentiment analysis worked! N-gram Analysis In Chapter 4, we considered the effect of words such as “not” and “no” on sentiment analysis of Jane Austen novels, such as considering whether a phrase like “don’t like” led  to  passages  incorrectly  being  labeled  as  positive.  The  Usenet  dataset  is  a  much larger corpus of more modern text, so we may be interested in how sentiment analy‐ sis may be reversed in this text. We’ll start by finding and counting all the bigrams in the Usenet posts.  usenet_bigrams  %   unnest_tokens bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2   usenet_bigram_counts  %   count newsgroup, bigram, sort = TRUE  %>%   ungroup   %>%   separate bigram, c "word1", "word2" , sep = " "   We could then define a list of six words that we suspect are used in negation, such as “no,”  “not,”  and  “without,”  and  visualize  the  sentiment-associated  words  that  most often follow them  Figure 9-9 . This shows the words that most often contribute in the “wrong” direction.  negate_words <- c "not", "without", "no", "can't", "don't", "won't"   usenet_bigram_counts %>%   filter word1 %in% negate_words  %>%   count word1, word2, wt = n, sort = TRUE  %>%   inner_join get_sentiments "afinn" , by = c word2 = "word"   %>%   mutate contribution = score * nn  %>%   group_by word1  %>%   top_n 10, abs contribution   %>%   ungroup   %>%   mutate word2 = reorder paste word2, word1, sep = "__" , contribution   %>%   ggplot aes word2, contribution, fill = contribution > 0   +  Sentiment Analysis      169     geom_col show.legend = FALSE  +   facet_wrap ~ word1, scales = "free", nrow = 3  +   scale_x_discrete labels = function x  gsub "__.+$", "", x   +   xlab "Words preceded by a negation"  +   ylab "Sentiment score *  of occurrences"  +   theme axis.text.x = element_text angle = 90, hjust = 1   +   coord_flip    Figure 9-9. Words that contribute the most to sentiment when they follow a “negating” word  170      Chapter 9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text   It looks like the largest sources of misidentifying a word as positive come from “don’t want like care,” and the largest source of incorrectly classified negative sentiment is “no problem.” Summary In this analysis of Usenet messages, we’ve incorporated almost every method for tidy text mining described in this book, ranging from tf-idf to topic modeling, and from sentiment  analysis  to  n-gram  tokenization.  Throughout  the  chapter,  and  indeed through all of our case studies, we’ve been able to rely on a small list of common tools for exploration and visualization. We hope that these examples show how much all tidy text analyses have in common with each other, and indeed with all tidy data anal‐ yses.

Much of the data available today is unstructured and text-heavy, making it challenging for analysts to apply their usual data wrangling and visualization tools. With this practical book, you’ll explore text-mining techniques with tidytext, a package that authors Julia Silge and David Robinson developed using the tidy principles behind R packages like ggraph and dplyr. You’ll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in R can make text analysis easier and more effective. The authors demonstrate how treating text as data frames enables you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics of text. You’ll also learn how to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into effective workflows. Practical code examples and data explorations will help you generate real insights from literature, news, and social media. Learn how to apply the tidy text format to NLP. Use sentiment analysis to mine the emotional content of text, Identify a document’s most important terms with frequency measurements, Explore relationships and connections between words with the ggraph and widyr packages, Convert back and forth between R’s tidy and non-tidy text formats, Use topic modeling to classify document collections into natural groups. Examine case studies that compare Twitter archives, dig into NASA metadata, and analyze thousands of Usenet messages.
