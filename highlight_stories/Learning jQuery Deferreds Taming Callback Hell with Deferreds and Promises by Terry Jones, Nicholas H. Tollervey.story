In building increasingly complex applications, JavaScript programmers have had to become more adept at dealing with asynchronous APIs. In earlier years, JavaScript was all client side. Programmers were only required to deal with single, independent asyn‐ chronous function calls, whose results were used to update an HTML user interface. The  situation  today  is  far  richer.  Server-side  JavaScript  applications  regularly  make multiple asynchronous calls to many other services to produce responses: to databases, caches, load balancers, the filesystem, authentication systems, third-party APIs, etc. Meanwhile, client-side JavaScript now has routine access to dozens of asynchronous APIs, such as those provided by HTML5 as well as good old AJAX  remember, the first A in AJAX stands for asynchronous . Applications need to be able to coordinate simul‐ taneous calls to multiple asynchronous APIs: to get the fastest result, to combine in‐ formation, to wait for multiple calls to complete, to execute calls in specific orders, to alter the flow of control depending on results, to deal with errors, to fall back to alternate services  e.g., on cache misses , to retry failing network calls, and so on. “Callback hell,” a phrase with about 10,000 Google hits, describes what happens when programmers try to build modern applications with old-school single-callback pro‐ gramming. For many programmers, this pain is their daily reality. Using single callbacks to build applications that need to do even basic coordination of asynchronous calls can be very difficult. You have to think hard and often end up with complicated, brittle, and opaque solutions. These contain hard-to-find bugs, are hard to document, and can be very hard to extend when additional asynchronous requirements enter the picture. Coding for multiple asynchronous events with the single-callback model is a real chal‐ lenge, even for very smart and experienced programmers.  vii   About You Firstly, we’re writing for jQuery programmers who do not know about deferreds. We’ve found that most programmers who use jQuery have never heard of deferreds. Among those who have, there are many who find deferreds confusing or who are under the false impression that they are too abstract or difficult to understand. Deferreds are a misun‐ derstood yet powerful programming paradigm. Recently, deferreds have been added to many JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and are now attracting widespread attention. A search for “deferreds” on StackOverflow currently gives over 18,000 hits, up 40% in the six months since we started this book. We also want to help JavaScript programmers, both client side and server side, who know about deferreds but aren’t making heavy use of them. If you’d like to beef up your prac‐ tical knowledge, to see more examples in action, and to think about deferreds from different angles, we’d love to have you as a reader. We want to help you stretch your mind, in both breadth and depth; the book has 18 real-world examples of deferred use along with 75 challenges  and their solutions  to push your thinking. Finally, and most ambitiously, we hope we’ve written a book that will be useful and stimulating to programmers using deferreds and promises beyond those in jQuery and even beyond JavaScript. The conceptual underpinnings of deferreds are almost identical across the many JavaScript packages and other programming languages that support them. Because the concepts are so similar and so few, you’ll find it straightforward to port code between implementations. Virtually everything you learn in this book will be useful for working with other flavors of deferreds. We want it to be a fun and valuable read, no matter what your preferred language is. We’ve tried to write the book we wish had been available as we learned deferreds ourselves. Our Aims In this book we’ll teach you how to avoid callback hell by using deferreds. But there’s much more to deferreds than that. Deferreds provide something that was not there before: a simple mechanism for dealing with future results. This gives you the opportunity to do things in different ways that go beyond mere simplification of syntax. It gives you the opportunity to really think about the practice of programming and to broaden your mental toolkit. The thinking can of course be critical, including conclu‐ sions about which deferred package to use or whether it is even sensible to use deferreds in a given situation. For us, the process of learning about and beginning to appreciate programming with deferreds was a feeling of our brains growing new muscles. Our primary aim is to introduce deferreds to programmers who have had no exposure to them. We’re aiming to give you a really strong general and concrete understanding of what deferreds are and how to wield them. If we succeed, you’ll be fully confident  viii     Preface   when encountering deferreds in any other context: whether with another JavaScript deferred package or in a different programming language. A secondary aim is to provide a broad collection of examples of nontrivial real-world deferred uses. We’ve been programming with deferreds  in Python and JavaScript  for the last 7 years and have pulled together some of the most useful examples we’ve built in that time. These are usually relatively short snippets of code, around 100 lines, but sometimes require careful thought to develop. We hope the detailed recipes in Chap‐ ter 3 will be a place you’ll return to for ideas on how to approach deferred problems you face. Challenges The deferred recipes in Chapter 3 all leave you with a set of challenges. These are meant to encourage you to engage with and think more deeply about the material just pre‐ sented. If you want to write code as well, that’s a bonus. The main point, however, is to think. Don’t be a passive reader! Working with deferreds very often requires focused thinking about how problems, and small variations on them, might be solved. Once you “get” deferreds, solving puzzles with them can be very engaging. The more you do it, the better you get, and the more you see their flexibility and power. Above all though, figuring out how to do things with deferreds is just plain fun! If you’re stuck on a challenge, you’ll find hints and solutions in Appendix A. jQuery Deferreds We chose to focus on jQuery deferreds because jQuery is ubiquitous and because two important and familiar aspects of jQuery  $.ajax and animations  already have deferred support built in. However, jQuery deferreds are certainly not the last word on the subject. As you will see, they differ markedly in one important respect from the many  at least 35  other deferred packages for JavaScript: jQuery deferreds do not currently follow the excellent Promises A+ specification  see “Promises A+” on page 78 . This book was written for the 1.10.2 or 2.0.3 versions of jQuery. Because the jQuery deferred API has changed several times, it is important to know where you stand, as we’ll see in “Changes in the jQuery Deferred API” on page 19. Server side, we’re using version 1.9.1 of the jQuery-deferred node module. The node module and much of the jQuery deferred code was written by Julian Aubourg.  Preface      ix   Our JavaScript Coding Style, or Lack Thereof JavaScript is not a “there’s only one way to do it” language. As a result, almost every line of code in the book could have been written differently. To keep the focus on deferreds, we’ve chosen to write code in the simplest clearest possible way. It will be up to you to slightly change our examples to fit whatever coding style or framework you’re using to, for example, create JavaScript objects  via new, using self-calling anonymous functions, global variables, etc. , loop  for loop, $.map, [].forEach etc. , write variable declara‐ tions, log via console.log, and so on. Also, in the name of keeping the focus on defer‐ reds, we often ignore  or almost ignore  error processing.

Preface      xiii    CHAPTER 1 Introduction  A deferred represents a result that may not be available yet. It is an abstraction for something that has yet to be realized. We attach code to the deferred to take care of the expected or erroneous result when it becomes available. That’s it! Deferred usage is very similar to the way we make plans: when X finishes, if there was no error, do Y, otherwise do Z. To give an everyday example, “when the tumble dryer finishes, if the clothes are dry, fold them and put them away, otherwise hang them on the line.” Here, “the tumble dryer finishes” is the deferred, “fold them” and “put them away” are handlers for the good case  also known as callbacks  and “hang them on the line” is the handler for an error condition  sometimes known as an errback . Once the plan is made, we’re free to get on with something else. Although the outcome of the deferred is undetermined, we can plan ahead for two possibilities: the clothes are either going to be wet or dry when the tumble dryer finishes. The dryer may actually already be finished, but that does not impact our planning. The important thing to note is that deferreds provide a clear separation between initiating something  resulting in a deferred  and handling the result  when the deferred com‐ pletes . There are many advantages from this clean separation, and in this book we’ll explore them. Don’t panic if this all seems a bit abstract; there are plenty of examples coming right up. Food for Thought JavaScript programs operate in an event-based environment. Let’s be clear about what that means. Keystrokes, mouse clicks, and low-level I O operations completing are all events. As your program runs, it can, in advance, tell the JavaScript runtime about events  1   it is interested in and provide code to execute when such events occur. Later, when events relevant to your program happen, the JavaScript runtime will invoke the code you wrote to handle them. This is a simple, efficient, and familiar model. It closely matches the way we plan ahead in our daily lives. Most of us could quickly make a breakfast of fresh orange juice, toast, and boiled eggs by preparing all three items at once. We know that we’ll have time to squeeze the oranges while the toast and the eggs are cooking, so we’ll get them both cooking first. We know what to do, regardless of whether the toast or the eggs are cooked first. On a grander scale, consider the kitchen staff of a busy restaurant. By initiating long-term actions  e.g., putting water on to boil , by reacting to events  e.g., the cheese on a dish is browning , and by switching among other tasks in the meantime, a small team can efficiently prepare a wide range of dishes for a large number of simultaneous diners. In event-based programming  and not only in JavaScript , handling single events is trivial. Coordinating code to handle multiple events, though, can be very challenging. Ad hoc solutions are often awkward to construct, difficult to test, brittle, hard for others to follow, and depressing to maintain. The problem rears its head even in trivial situations. For example, suppose you have a JavaScript food API available, with makeToast and makeEggs functions. Both accept a callback function that they call once their product is done, passing the finished result as an argument. An example call looks like:  makeToast function toast {        Toast is ready! } ;  Your challenge is to write a function called makeBreakfast that gets the toast and the eggs cooking simultaneously and that calls a single callback when both are ready.  function makeBreakfast callback {        Use makeToast and makeEggs to make toast and eggs simultaneously.        When both are ready, pass them to callback. }  Pause now, please, and think about how you’d implement makeBreakfast. Here’s a common strategy: when either underlying function  makeToast or makeEggs  finishes, check to see if the other result is also available. If so, call the callback. If not, store the result so the termination of the other function can pass it to the callback. The resulting code isn’t elegant and doesn’t generalize well. What if making breakfast ex‐ pands to also include making coffee and pancakes?1  1. See “when” on page 13 for jQuery’s solution.  2      Chapter 1: Introduction   This is an extremely trivial example of managing multiple events, yet our code is already a mess. Real-world scenarios are almost always more complex, and can of course be much more complex. If you had to solve problems like the above a few times, you’d soon see a general pattern. You’d likely write a helper function or two. And if you did that, you’d be well on your way to implementing deferreds! Terminology: Deferreds and Promises We need to get a little terminology clear from the very beginning: the difference between deferreds and promises in jQuery.2 Continuing with our food theme, the first edition3 of Twisted Network Programming Essentials by Abe Fettig  O’Reilly  gives a beautiful analogy of deferreds in the real world. Some popular restaurants use remotely activated buzzers to let diners know when a table is available. This avoids a physical queue of waiting customers clogging up the entrance to the restaurant and allows future diners to enjoy a drink at the bar or a short walk in the interim. This elegant approach moves us from a problematic and boring synchronous solution  waiting in line  to an asynchronous one that lets everyone get on with other things in the meantime. When the maître d’hôtel puts your details  number of diners, seating preference, etc.  into the restaurant’s system, he or she is taking the first in a series of steps that will result in you eventually getting a table. In jQuery terminology, the maître d’ creates a de‐ ferred. You are handed a buzzer, which corresponds to a promise. At some point in the future, when a table becomes free, the maître d’ will push a button or click a mouse to “resolve” the deferred and the buzzer will go off in your pocket. Importantly, you  the holder of the promise , cannot cause the buzzer to go off. Only the maître d’  the holder of the deferred  can do that. With jQuery deferreds, things work in exactly the same way. The programmer writing a function that needs to get some slow work done  for example, a database operation or a network call  creates a deferred and arranges to fire it when the result of the work becomes available. From the deferred a promise is obtained and returned to the caller. Just like the diner with the buzzer, the caller cannot cause the promise to fire. Just as future diners can have a drink at the bar, a program that receives a promise can get on  2. Note that jQuery’s terminology  and implementation  is slightly different from other packages, some of which do not use the term “deferred” at all. At some point you might like to read the Wikipedia article on “Futures and promises”.  3. Jessica McKellar was added as an author in the second edition and the nice analogy was removed. Our  reference is to the second edition.  Terminology: Deferreds and Promises      3   with other computations instead of twiddling its thumbs while waiting for the promise to fire. To summarize: create deferreds but return promises. Familiar Promises If you’ve ever used $.ajax in jQuery or used any of the animate methods, you’ve already used a promise. For example, you may have written:  $ 'label' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100, function  {        Animation done. } ;  The return value of the animate function gives you a way to get a promise that is resolved when the animation finishes. You could instead have written:  var promise = $ 'label' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 .promise  ;  promise.done function  {        Animation done. } ;  That may not seem like a big deal, but what if you want to coordinate what happens after two animations have finished? Using promises, it’s trivial:  var promise1 = $ 'label-1' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 .promise  ; var promise2 = $ 'label-2' .animate { opacity: 0.75 }, 200 .promise  ;  $.when promise1, promise2 .done function  {        Both animations are done. } ;  The jQuery $.when method can accept multiple promises and return a new one that will let you know when all the passed promises have resolved. Contrast the simplicity of the above with the breakfast-making shenanigans in “Food for Thought” on page 1. The $.ajax method returns a value that also has promise methods. So, you could write the following:  $.when $.ajax 'http:  google.com' , $.ajax 'http:  yahoo.com'  .then      function googlePage, yahooPage {            Both URLs have been fetched.     }  ;  It’s easy to do more complex things, e.g., fetch the contents of two URLs, run an ani‐ mation after each loads, and then do something else when all four events are finished:  $.when      $.ajax 'http:  google.com' .then function  {         return $ 'label_1' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 ;  4      Chapter 1: Introduction       } ,     $.ajax 'http:  yahoo.com' .then function  {         return $ 'label_2' .animate { opacity: 0.75 }, 200 ;     }   .then      function  {            Both URLs have been fetched and both animations have completed.     }  ;  Notice how the code almost reads like a natural language description of a simple plan. Unfortunately, deferreds have a reputation for being abstract and difficult to under‐ stand. As we’ve seen though, they’re not! They’re conceptually very close to the way we naturally think about and plan for future events. The basic understanding of deferreds provided in this chapter is all you need to enjoy some of the mind-bending, elegant, and downright fun ways in which deferreds can make event-based programming so challenging and rewarding. We’ll see a ton of ex‐ amples of using deferreds in Chapter 3. But before we do that, we’ll need to learn about the jQuery deferred API.  Familiar Promises      5    CHAPTER 2 The jQuery Deferred API  There are different levels at which you can learn about jQuery deferreds, and these each give a different perspective. At  the  lowest  level  there  is  the  JavaScript  source,  the  jQuery  deferred.js  and  call‐ backs.js files. Reading the source is very informative, but it’s definitely not the simplest JavaScript to understand! Besides being challenging to follow  jQuery is optimized for code size and execution speed, not readability , the source also doesn’t tell you what deferreds are for or how to use them. From reading the source, it’s not even clear what the methods available on deferreds might be. Next, there’s the official jQuery documentation for the Deferred object, jQuery.when  which we’ll refer to as $.when from now on , and the .promise   function for DOM element collections. The API documentation tells you what methods are available, what their arguments are, methods that are deprecated or that have changed between ver‐ sions, etc. You’ll want to read the official documentation closely and will probably return to it many times as you become increasingly fluent with deferreds. A further level is a proposal  see “Promises A+” on page 78  for standardizing the be‐ havior  of  promises  across  JavaScript  libraries.  While  not  directly  associated  with jQuery’s deferreds and promises, it illustrates the guidance that informed the imple‐ mentation of the API. What’s missing is a higher-level discussion that explains the API and the dynamics of deferreds. That’s what we aim to provide in this chapter. We discuss every API method and often show examples of API calls, but we’re not attempting to duplicate the online documentation. Read our description to understand the API and then consult the of‐ ficial documentation if you need more detail. A natural way to begin is to first look at what you can do when a promise is returned by a function you call. Once you understand that, it’s easy to learn how to make deferreds yourself so that your code can return promises to others.  7   Consuming Promises What kinds of functions return promises? There are three ways you can receive a promise using jQuery  two of which we men‐ tioned in “Familiar Promises” on page 4 . First, $.ajax returns a promise.1 Most jQuery users are used to using $.ajax by passing error and success functions in the call to create the request. But you can also treat the return value of $.ajax as a promise and reap the benefits of operating on deferreds. Second, we’ve seen that jQuery animate methods return an object with a promise method that returns you a promise. Third, when you select a set of DOM elements  e.g., $ 'p'  to select all HTML   elements , the result is an object with a promise method that also returns a promise. By default it resolves when all animations on the selected elements are finished. In addition to these, you might receive promises from function calls to other  non- jQuery  JavaScript APIs. However it happens, if you have your hands on a promise, it’s important to understand what you can do with it.  More Terminology: Resolve, Reject and Progress The first thing to understand about a promise is that it was created from a deferred. Whoever made the deferred is going to arrange for the promise they gave you to deliver you a value. jQuery uses resolve, reject, and progress to describe the things that can happen to your promise. If nothing goes wrong, the promise will be resolved. If an error occurs, it will be rejected. Along the way, the deferred might make measurable progress and report this to your promise. In this book we’ll sometimes informally say a deferred or a promise has fired. By this we mean that the deferred was rejected or resolved, but that we don’t care which.  1. Actually, this is not strictly true. $.ajax returns an object that has methods that point to the promise methods on a deferred that $.ajax uses internally. For regular jQuery users, this detail is of no importance and can be ignored.  8      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API   In the following API examples, we assume you have a variable called promise  obtained  from  a  function  that  created  a  deferred  and  re‐ turned its promise.  done Use the done method on a promise to arrange for a function to be called if the deferred is resolved:  promise.done function result {        result is the value with which the deferred was resolved.     console.log 'The promise was resolved with', result ; } ;  done can be called many times on the same promise. Each call results in the passed function  being  added  to  a  list  of  functions  that  will  be  called  when  the  promise  is resolved. The function you pass to  done will be called with all the arguments the deferred is resolved with. The above example just shows the simple case of a deferred being resolved with one argument. Note that there is no point in returning a value from a done callback! Any returned value will simply disappear. It will not be passed on. It will not be given to other done callback functions. All  done callbacks are independent. They will all be called with the same value. If you want to modify the result of a promise so as to pass the modified value along, you’ll need to use then, explained on page 11.  fail Use the fail method on a promise to arrange for a function to be called if the deferred is rejected:  promise.fail function error {        error is the value with which the deferred was rejected.     console.log 'The promise was rejected with', error ; } ;  As with  done,  fail can be called multiple times to add failure functions. Functions passed to fail will be called with the full set of arguments the deferred was rejected with. Also, as with callbacks attached via done, there is no point in returning a value from a fail callback.  Consuming Promises      9   always If you want a function to be called no matter whether the original deferred is resolved or rejected, you can pass it to the always method on the promise. This is useful, for example, in cleaning up or logging: promise.always function value {        The deferred fired with value, either via its resolve or reject method.     console.log 'The promise fired with value', value ; } ;  Note that in the callback function above, you may not be able to tell whether the value comes from the deferred being resolved or rejected, and you shouldn’t care. If you do care, you should probably be using done and or fail. As with done and fail, always can be called multiple times to add functions that should always be called. All arguments used to reject or resolve the deferred will be passed along to the promise always functions. Also, as with callbacks attached via done and fail, there is no point in returning a value from an always callback.  progress Deferreds may be able to report periodically on the progress of the asynchronous activity they’re associated with. A progress callback can be used to handle these events:  promise.progress function value {        A progress value has been reported by the deferred.     console.log 'Progress!', value ; } ;  Note that a progress function can be called many times. This can be used to support, for example, a user interface that updates a progress bar as an operation proceeds. jQuery calls progress callbacks every jQuery.fx.interval milliseconds on elements that are being animated. See the entry for the progress attribute of the jQuery ani mate  documentation.  In  reading  the  animate  documentation,  note  that  passing  a progress function to the animate constructor via:  $ 'something' .animate {..., progress: function  { ... }   is equivalent to:  $ 'something' .animate ... .promise  .progress function  { ... }   As with done, fail, and always, progress can be called multiple times to add functions that should receive progress information. Also, as with callbacks attached via  done, fail, and always, there is no point in returning a value from a progress callback.  10      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API   promise The jQuery promise function can be used to obtain a promise against the completion of  actions  on  a  selection  of  DOM  elements.  Here’s  an  example,  adapted  from the .promise   documentation:  $ 'div' .each function i {     $ this .fadeIn  .fadeOut 1000 *  i + 1  ; } ;  $ 'div' .promise  .done function  {        All   animations are finished. } ;  By default, the promise method will return a promise from a deferred that is resolved when all animations on an element collection have fired. You can also pass an argument to promise to name a different event queue that the promise should correspond to  the default name is “fx,” for “effects” . An even more advanced method is to pass an object to promise, in which case jQuery will attach the usual promise methods  done, fail, etc.  to the object and return it. These nondefault uses of promise are outside the scope of this book. To learn more, see the .promise   documentation and hunt for examples online.  The  promise function is only available client side: it operates on a collection of elements jQuery has selected from the DOM.  then then is the only mechanism jQuery provides to take output values from one deferred, modify them, and plug them in as inputs to another deferred. You cannot do this with done, fail, or progress: any values returned by those callbacks are ignored. To properly understand what then does, you need to know that it creates a new deferred and returns its promise. Behind the scenes, it hooks up the output of the original promise to go through the modifying functions you provide and to then trigger the new deferred it has created  whose promise it will return . The modification functions you give to then can themselves return new promises. You can pass then up to three positional function arguments, to process a resolve value, an error value, or progress values from the original promise. Pad the call to then with null arguments, if necessary, to ensure that your function is in the correct position. Here is a fanciful example that passes all three callback functions to then:  Consuming Promises      11   promise.then      function result {            The deferred was resolved with result. Double it and pass it on.         return 2 * result;     },     function error {            The deferred was rejected with error. Log it and pass on a different             null  error.         console.log 'Error received:', error ;         return null;     },     function value {            The deferred made progress. Convert it to a percentage string.         return Math.round value * 100.0  + '%';     }  ;  Below is an example where only progress values from the original promise are modified and passed on. Any resolve or reject value will be passed through unchanged to the new promise, which logs progress and the eventual resolved value. Don’t worry if you don’t understand the calls to promise, notify, and resolve; you’ll learn about them in “Cre‐ ating Deferreds” on page 15.  var d = $.Deferred  ,     promise = d.promise  ;  var newPromise = promise.then      null,     null,     function value {            The deferred made progress. Convert to a percentage string.         return Math.round value * 100.0  + '%';     }  ;  newPromise.progress function value {     console.log 'Progress:', value ; } ;  newPromise.done function value {     console.log 'Finished:', value ; } ;  d.notify 0.141592 ; d.notify 0.618033 ; d.resolve 27 ;  Progress: 14% Progress: 62% Finished: 27  12      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API  The preceding code produces the following output on the console:   Although the call signature of the then method of jQuery promises resembles the then method of promises that follow the Promises A + specification, the two functions behave quite differently when it comes to processing errors and handling exceptions. In addition, the Promises A+  then function only accepts two arguments. We’ll dis‐ cuss the differences in “Promises A+” on page 78.  state New deferreds start life in a pending state and remain that way until they are either resolved or rejected. Once resolved or rejected, their state can no longer change. You can call state to discover the state of a deferred  or its promise . You’ll get back a string, one of 'pending', 'resolved', or 'rejected'. Unless you’re debugging, you’re unlikely to need this function.  when jQuery has a when function to help you work with multiple promises. In this book we’ll refer to it as $.when, which is how you’ll likely use it in your code. Note that $.when is a totally separate top-level jQuery function; it’s not part of a deferred or a promise. If you have to call several functions that return promises and take an action only when all are completed, $.when is your friend. Before we see how convenient $.when is, though, you can learn a lot by thinking about how it might work and by writing a version of it yourself, no matter how primitive or restricted. This should remind you strongly of the makeBreakfast challenge in “Food for Thought” on page 1. Here’s how you might naively write code to take an action after two promises are finished without using $.when:  function callAfter firstAction, secondAction, finalize {        Call finalize after the deferreds returned by firstAction and        secondAction have both finished. Pass finalize the result from both        deferreds.         NOTE: Don't write code like this!  Use $.when instead.      var finishedCount = 0, result1, result2;      firstAction  .done          function result {             finishedCount++;             result1 = result;             if  finishedCount === 2 {                 finalize result1, result2 ;  Consuming Promises      13               }         }      ;      secondAction  .done          function result {             finishedCount++;             result2 = result;             if  finishedCount === 2 {                 finalize result1, result2 ;             }         }      ; }  There are some serious problems with the above!2  1. There is no error checking. If firstAction or secondAction return a promise that  is ultimately rejected, this is not handled.  2. What if we want to call three promise-returning functions, not two? More code duplication is needed and existing calls to callAfter will need to be found and changed.  3. What happens if firstAction or secondAction doesn’t return a promise? 4. The return value of finalize is lost.  In spite of these problems, our code contains the core of what’s needed. It keeps count of how many promises have been resolved and keeps the results for the eventual calling of finalize. Most importantly, it gets its work done in a callback it adds to each promise it needs to monitor. That’s a pattern you’ll encounter repeatedly in this book and in deferred-using code in the wild. It’s part of what makes deferreds so cool. The jQuery $.when function  with some help from then  takes care of all these issues, allowing you to simply write:  $.when firstAction  , secondAction   .then finalize ;  The call to $.when returns a new promise, as does the call to then. If either firstAc tion or secondAction rejects the promise it returns, the error value will be propagated to finalize. Can you see why the final result, from finalize, is no longer lost? When it becomes available, it will be used to resolve the promise returned by then. So if you need the result, you can simply write:  2. Later, in “when2: An Improved jQuery.when” on page 63, we’ll write a much more robust function that doesn’t  have these issues.  14      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API   $.when firstAction  , secondAction   .then finalize .done function  {        arguments holds the result returned by the finalize function. } ;  $.when also correctly handles the case in which the value returned by either  or both  of firstAction or secondAction is not a deferred.  There’s a gotcha to watch out for when using $.when. The follow‐ ing doesn’t behave as you might hope:  var promises = [     $.ajax 'http:  google.com' ,     $.ajax 'http:  yahoo.com' ,     $.ajax 'http:  www.nytimes.com'  ];     NOTE: DON'T DO THIS! $.when promises .then function results {     console.log 'All URLs fetched.' ; } ;  There are two problems here. First, $.when expects promises to be given as individual parameters, not as an array. Second, the results of the promises will be passed by $.when as individual parameters to the callback function, not as a single array of results. To pass an array of promises to $.when, you’ll therefore need to use apply:  var promises = [     $.ajax 'http:  google.com' ,     $.ajax 'http:  yahoo.com' ,     $.ajax 'http:  www.nytimes.com'  ];  $.when.apply $, promises .then      function result1, result2, result3 {         console.log 'All URLs fetched.' ;     }  ;  Creating Deferreds Once you’re comfortable receiving promises from functions and working with them by attaching callbacks, you’ll soon want to write your own function or API that creates a deferred and returns its promise.  Construction To create a deferred, you just call $.Deferred  :  var deferred = $.Deferred  ;  Creating Deferreds      15   As discussed in “Terminology: Deferreds and Promises” on page 3, instead of returning a deferred to the caller of your code, you’ll almost always want to return a promise. The promise is obtained by calling the promise method on the deferred:  var deferred = $.Deferred  ,     promise = deferred.promise  ;  For convenience, the $.Deferred constructor allows you to pass it a function that can be used to initialize the deferred once it is created. The function receives the deferred as its only argument. For example, here’s a handy  succeed function3 that returns a promise that has already been fired with a specified result:  function succeed value {     return $.Deferred function d {         d.resolve value ;     } .promise  ; }  Can you think of situations in which succeed might be useful?  Don’t worry if not— keep reading.  You may find it interesting to read the official API documentation on jQuery.Deferred  .  resolve and resolveWith You normally create a deferred and return its promise to your caller because you want to arrange for a slow task  such as a network or other I O call  to be performed. When the task completes, you use the resolve method on the deferred to trigger the calling of any done or always callbacks attached to the promise. The resolve call signature is dead simple: just call it with any arguments you like. These will be passed to all done and always callbacks added to the deferred’s promise. It is perfectly acceptable, and quite common, to resolve a deferred before returning its promise. This tends to happen in situations where you write a function that normally causes a long-running task to be initiated but which sometimes already knows the an‐ swer, as we’ll see in “Memoization” on page 49. You can keep your function interface consistent  i.e., always returning a promise  by returning a promise that corresponds to a deferred you have already resolved. One beauty of deferreds is that your caller does not need to know whether the promise you return has already been resolved—they just add callbacks to it with no regard for the timing of resolution or rejection. The variant, resolveWith, allows you to also pass a context object, which is then pro‐ vided to the always and done callbacks as their this object.  3. This is named after the Twisted Python function of the same name.  16      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API   reject and rejectWith To indicate to a promise that an error has occurred  thus invoking its always and fail callbacks , use the reject method on the deferred. As with resolve, you may pass any arguments you like to the  reject call. These will be passed to all  fail and  always callbacks added to the deferred’s promise. As with deferred resolution, it is perfectly acceptable to reject a deferred before returning its promise. The variant, rejectWith, allows you to also pass a context object, which is then provided to the always and fail callbacks as their this object.  notify and notifyWith After you’ve created a deferred and returned its promise, you’ll at some later point want to resolve or reject the deferred so your caller  who has the promise  can proceed. In some circumstances, though, you might obtain information about the progress of the underlying operation that you launched, and may want to pass that information along to the promise holder. The classic UI example is an animated progress bar that shows the user what percentage complete a task is. The notify call signature is also dead simple: just call notify with any arguments you like. These will be passed to all progress callbacks added to the deferred’s promise. And yes, you guessed it, the notifyWith variant allows you to also pass a context object, which is then provided to the progress callbacks as their this object. Note that once you have resolved or rejected a deferred, further notify calls on it will have no effect  i.e., they will not result in invocation of any progress callbacks on the promise . Putting It All Together Now that you know all about creating deferreds and consuming promises, it should be clear that there are three pairs of methods on a deferred that you can invoke that cause the running of a corresponding set of callbacks on the promise for the deferred. Table 2-1 shows the naming correspondence. If you call a deferred method named in the left column with some set of arguments, all the callbacks added via the promise method named in the right column will be invoked, in the order they were added, each with the same set of arguments.  Putting It All Together      17   Table 2-1. Correspondence between deferred and promise method names Deferred method resolve or resolveWith done reject or rejectWith notify or notifyWith  Promise method  progress  fail  Deferred Dynamics Here is a summary of aspects of deferred behavior  some of which were described at length earlier  that you need to understand, along with some principles of deferred usage:    If your code creates a deferred but doesn’t eventually cause it to be resolved or rejected, you’re probably doing it wrong. Almost without exception, code that cre‐ ates a deferred should be responsible for getting it fired.    A  function  that  creates  a  deferred  can  resolve  or  reject  it  before  its  promise  is  returned.    If you write a function that creates a deferred that you want to return, return the  result of calling promise   on the deferred.    Any always, done, or fail callbacks added to a promise whose deferred has already  been resolved or rejected will be called immediately, as appropriate.    The resolve, reject, and notify methods of a deferred can be called with any number of arguments, all of which will be passed to the corresponding methods on the promise.    When a deferred is resolved  or rejected , the done  or fail  callbacks of its promise  are invoked in the order they were added.    always callback functions are appended to both the done and fail lists of functions to be called when the deferred fires. So they will be called, in turn, as the functions in the list of done or fail callbacks is invoked.    Fire at will! It’s not an error to resolve or reject a deferred multiple times. As you’d expect, only the first resolve or reject triggers callbacks attached to the promise. You don’t need to keep track of whether a deferred you create has been fired. The de‐ ferred handles that for you.    If you call notify on a deferred that has already been resolved or rejected, nothing happens  i.e., any progress callbacks attached to the deferred’s promise will not be called .    It is perfectly safe to return the same promise instance to multiple independent callers of your code. Any  done,  fail, or  progress callbacks added to it cannot  18      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API   interfere with one another. In other words, there is no chaining of returned values from done, fail, or progress callbacks.    Only then can be used to pass on a modified return value from a deferred. It does  this by creating a new deferred and returning its promise.    If, as a promise consumer, you find yourself wondering about whether a promise has fired or not  i.e., your code relies on state , you probably don’t fully understand deferreds. Part of the point is that you don’t have to worry.    Use reject for low-level, fundamental, exceptional problems  i.e., where you’d raise an exception in nondeferred code . For example, if you make a call to a remote HTTP  service,  use  reject  for  the  cases  where  there’s  a  network  error.  Use  re solve to send back a status code  even if it’s an error code  and a result.  Deprecated Promise Methods We’ll mention the deprecated promise methods in case you ever have to maintain older jQuery-based code. If possible, replace them with the suggested alternatives.  isRejected and isResolved isRejected  and  isResolved  returned  Boolean  values  to  indicate  if  a  deferred  or promise is in a rejected or resolved state. They were deprecated in jQuery 1.7 and re‐ moved in 1.8. Use the new state method instead.  pipe pipe is the now-deprecated  in jQuery 1.8  original name of the then method. The two are identical: a quick look at deferred.js reveals the line promise.pipe = promise.then;. Changes in the jQuery Deferred API Be careful when reading the jQuery Deferred object documentation. Deferreds were introduced  to  jQuery  in  version  1.5  and  in  several  subsequent  versions  there  were changes to parts of the deferred API. For example, in the documentation for then, you’ll see its supported call signatures changed in versions 1.7 and 1.8 and that the different behaviors are all still documented. When reading code that uses jQuery deferreds, it is therefore sometimes important to know what version of jQuery the code will be run against. That advice applies to this book  too   jQuery  versions  1.10.2  and  2.0.3  are  now  current .  And,  needless  to  say  hopefully! , when you’re writing deferred code you need to know what version of jQuery will be loaded.  Deprecated Promise Methods      19   Likewise, if you’re modernizing an existing project that uses deferreds, be careful in moving to a new version of jQuery—especially if, through some inconceivable chain of events, the code you’re working on doesn’t have a test suite!  20      Chapter 2: The jQuery Deferred API   CHAPTER 3 Deferred Recipes  In this chapter you will find many examples of using jQuery deferreds. These are all based on actual use cases. The intention is to show you a broad collection of real-world uses of deferreds in order to make this book maximally useful. Although we’ve arranged the examples to be read in order of increasing difficulty, most of them can be read in isolation. We encourage you to “dip in” wherever it’s useful. A Replacement for the setTimeout Function Sometimes, when using a site such as Twitter or Gmail, a warning message appears when an asynchronous task is taking too long. For example, Twitter will replace the “spinner” at the bottom of their infinite scroll with an “oops” message along with a suggestion that you click a link to trigger the request again or refresh the page. Gmail is cleverer: when there is a connectivity problem, it displays a warning message and then counts down until the point at which it retries the network call that failed. There is a built-in function in JavaScript called setTimeout. It works like this:  setTimeout function  {     console.log 'Display after half a second' ; }, 500 ; console.log 'Display immediately  unblocked ' ;  The result of this is:  Display immediately  unblocked  Display after half a second  Implementing the functionality described above using just setTimeout might be hard to do in a clear and comprehensible way, especially if there were the potential for nested calls to setTimeout.  21   This kind of thing is easy to achieve with deferreds. In fact, the Gmail example almost reads as if it is describing a deferred: “when there is a connectivity problem, display a warning message and then retry after a certain number of seconds.” Here’s a simple replacement for setTimeout that uses deferreds. This is adapted from Fun With jQuery Deferreds by Michael Bleigh.  function wait timeout {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;     setTimeout deferred.resolve, timeout ;     return deferred.promise  ; }  And here’s how you use it:  wait 500 .done function  {     console.log 'Timeout fired!' ; } ;  This produces the following, as you would expect:  Timeout fired!  Given a promise-based timeout, it is not too hard to combine it with other promises to create solutions similar to those implemented by Twitter and Gmail. We’ll show you how you might do this in “Using when2 to Time Out a Single Promise” on page 67, once we have another handy utility in our deferred tool belt. Furthermore, the promise re‐ turned by the wait function is a representation of the timeout that can be reused and passed around your code in ways that would be impossible if you’d stuck to the plain old setTimeout function.  Challenges 1. As you may remember from reading “Construction” on page 15, you can pass a function to $.Deferred. The function will be called with the new deferred instance. This is just a convenience; you can create and configure a deferred in one go. Change wait to work in this way.  2. Suppose there were functions called one and two that you wanted to call when the timeout expired. You could put calls to them into the function you pass to then. Subtly different though would be to instead somehow pass the timeout to those other functions. How would you do that?  3. setTimeout returns a value that can be passed to  clearTimeout to prevent the timeout function from being run. Our wait function lacks this capability. Change it so that it returns a promise that also has a cancel method on it that will cause the promise returned by wait to be rejected.  22      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Messaging in Chrome Extensions A common need when working on a project that uses deferreds is to use an existing callback-based API in a way that’s compatible with deferreds. This is usually a simple task. Here we’ll illustrate the process using the messaging API found in Chrome extensions. Don’t worry if you don’t use Chrome or don’t build extensions with it; this example doesn’t require any prior Chrome experience. A Chrome extension can have an invisible “background” page that communicates with “content scripts” running in the tabs the user has open. The API call used by the back‐ ground page to send a message to a tab is chrome.tabs.sendMessage, with the following signature:  chrome.tabs.sendMessage tabId, message, responseCallback ;  Here the message can be anything at all. The responseCallback, if provided, will be called with a response if the content script running in the tab wants to send back a reply, or will be called with no argument in the case of a Chrome error  e.g., trying to send a message to a nonexistent tab . So a typical nondeferred usage might be:  chrome.tabs.sendMessage 17, { action: 'addSidebar' }, function result {     if  result === undefined {         console.error 'Chrome error:', chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;     }     else if  result.success {         console.log 'Sidebar added to DOM.' ;     }     else {         console.error 'Could not add sidebar to tab 17:', result.error ;     } } ;  To  convert  this  to  code  that  uses  deferreds,  we’ll  first  need  a  replacement  for chrome.tabs.sendMessage that returns a promise: function sendMessageDeferred tabId, message {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;          chrome.tabs.sendMessage tabId, message, function result {         if  result === undefined {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;             }         else {             deferred.resolve result ;             }     } ;      return deferred.promise  ;     }  Messaging in Chrome Extensions      23   You’ll use this pattern over and over again as you work with deferreds.  Make a deferred, whose promise will be returned to the caller. Arrange to reject the deferred if anything goes wrong in making the API call s  you need to make. Arrange to resolve the deferred with a result value if all goes well. Return the deferred’s promise to our caller.  With the sendMessageDeferred function in place, we can now use it in our code:  sendMessageDeferred 17, { action: 'addSidebar' }  .done function result {     if  result.success {         console.log 'Sidebar added to DOM.' ;     }     else {         console.error 'Could not add sidebar to tab 17:', result.error ;     } }  .fail function error {     console.error 'Chrome error:', error ; } ;  We could use $.when to send messages to several tabs, only proceeding once all tabs had replied:  $.when      sendMessageDeferred 17, { action: 'addSidebar' } ,     sendMessageDeferred 18, { action: 'hideSidebar' } ,     sendMessageDeferred 19, { action: 'hideSidebar' }    .done function  {     console.log 'All tab sidebars adjusted.' ; }  .fail function error {     console.error 'Chrome error:', error ; } ;  As we saw in “when” on page 13, it’s quite awkward to log a status line  as in the done callback above  after sending a message to multiple tabs without using deferreds. Fur‐ ther, in this simple example, the set of tabs to send to is static. Writing this code without deferreds is much more difficult if the set of tabs to send to is stored in a list of arbitrary size.  Challenges 1. What will happen if the content script in the tab receiving the message does not call  the sendResponse function?  24      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   2. If the tabs wanted to return a result  for example, the elapsed time taken to hide or  show the sidebar , how would we access the three results?  Accessing Chrome Local Storage As a second example of converting a callback API to a deferred API, let’s write a deferred- based API for access to the Chrome browser’s local storage. The Chrome local storage API differs from the W3C Web Storage localStorage API in some important ways. Of most interest to us is that the Chrome local storage is asynchronous. The methods used to get, set, etc., keys each take a callback function that is called once the storage operation has completed. You can check the chrome.stor age documentation for the complete details of the API. Making a deferred API from the Chrome API is very easy. There are five functions: get, getBytesInUse, set, clear, and remove. They all have similar signatures. For example, set looks like this:  chrome.storage.local.set items, callback   To make a deferred method for set, we don’t really need to know what items represents. All we need to know is that callback will be called by Chrome when it has set the key values it is given. Our version of set will look as follows:  function set items {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;          chrome.storage.local.set items, function  {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;             }         else {             deferred.resolve  ;             }     } ;      return deferred.promise  ;     }  This should look familiar by now. It follows the classic pattern:  Create a deferred. Arrange to reject the deferred in case of error. Arrange to resolve the deferred with a result if no error occurs. Return a promise created from the deferred.  Accessing Chrome Local Storage      25   You’d use the above set function as follows:  set {     lastURL: 'http:  bit.ly jquery-deferreds',     timestamp: new Date  .toUTCString   } .done function  {        Keys for the user's last URL and timestamp saved to local storage. } ;  Challenges 1. Write deferred versions for the other chrome.storage.local functions  get, get  BytesInUse, remove, and clear .  2. The node.js Redis package provides a callback-style interface to the Redis. Choose some Redis API calls and make deferred versions of them. Your functions should call the existing callback-based API to get the Redis work done; you’re just providing a deferred interface.  Running Promise-Returning Functions One by One There will be occasions when you need to call several promise-returning functions one by one, with each function starting only after the preceding one has completed. Some‐ times implicit dependencies between the functions require this, but more commonly you’ll just need to use the result of an early function as an input to a later one. If you read Chapter 2, you’ll already know how to do this by using the then method of a returned promise. For example, if you want to change the opacity on one DOM ele‐ ment and only then change the opacity on a second element, you could write:  var promise = $ 'label-1' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 .promise       .then function  {         return $ 'label-2' .animate { opacity: 0.75 }, 200 .promise  ;     } ;  While this doesn’t look too bad for running two functions one after another, it quickly gets uglier with more. A more serious drawback is that because it is just static code, it can’t be used if we have a list of promise-returning functions we need to run one after the other. It would look much nicer—and be easier to add to—if we could write something like this:  var promise = synchronously [     [ $ 'label-1' .animate, { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 ],     [ $ 'label-2' .animate, { opacity: 0.75 }, 200 ] ] ;  26      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Fortunately, it’s easy to write synchronously, a function that takes a list of functions to run, along with their arguments. It returns a promise that fires when all functions have been run to completion one after another. Here’s how it might look:  function synchronously tasks {     var i, task, func,         promise = $.Deferred  .resolve  .promise  ,             makeRunner = function func, args {                 return function  {                 return func.apply null, args .promise  ;             };         };     for  i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++ {         task = tasks[i];         func = task.shift  ;         promise = promise.then makeRunner func, task  ;         }     return promise; }  This works as follows:  Create a promise variable that we’ll eventually return. The deferred from which the promise is made is resolved immediately with an undefined value. When we first call  then on that promise, the function we pass to  then will be run immediately. Note that we don’t care about the value the promise fires with; we’re just trying to get the task functions run sequentially. makeRunner functions as a closure that returns a function to invoke the current task with its arguments. Note that we assume that calling func returns either a promise or something that can be used to obtain a promise. There  is  an  unfortunate  subtlety  here.  All  promises  have  a  promise  method  undocumented!  that, when called with no arguments, returns the promise. The method is actually identical to the  documented  promise method of its deferred. So if func returns a promise, calling promise   on it simply returns the promise. More usefully, if func happens to be a call to animate, the call to promise   is essential—it ensures that the returned value, passed to then, is a promise. See the challenges below for more on this.  This  slightly  dubious  line  reuses   updates   the  promise  variable  to  hold  the promise returned by calling then on the current promise. In effect, we’re adding a new function to be called when the current promise is done and then forgetting about that promise. We only have to worry about the most recent promise, which we return to our caller. Because the original promise was fired on creation, we don’t have to hang onto it for any reason.  Running Promise-Returning Functions One by One      27   Challenges 1. Improve the synchronously function so that each function is run with a passed  this object for its context.  2. The anonymous function passed to promise.then in synchronously ignores any  arguments it is passed. Why is that? What will its arguments be?  3. How could you improve synchronously to allow for the case in which some of the functions to be called did not return promises or objects with a promise method? 4. The following code fragment is identical to the first one above, but it uses done  instead of then:  var promise = $ 'label-1' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 .promise       .done          function  {             return $ 'label-2' .animate { opacity: 0.75 }, 200 .promise  ;         }      ;  What difference will this make to code that adds callbacks to the promise? The answer is important. If you don’t know it, you don’t properly understand jQuery deferreds yet.  5. This fragment uses when instead of then:  var promise = $.when      $ 'label-1' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 ,     $ 'label-2' .animate { opacity: 0.75 }, 200   ;  How will this behave differently from our earlier two fragments that used then and done? Why is it not necessary to call .promise   on the result of the call to animate?  A Promise Pool with an emptyPromise Method When running a node service, you’ll occasionally need to shut it down. The service might have many requests in progress, so ideally, you should shut things down grace‐ fully. Some of the outstanding requests may have users on the other ends of them. When the shutdown signal arrives, you may need to make several calls to cleanly disconnect from other services or to start others. In these cases, a useful and simple trick is to maintain a pool of promises that correspond to outstanding tasks, and to provide a method that returns a promise that fires when the pool is empty  i.e., when all the promises in the pool have completed .  28      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Creating a Promise Pool Here’s  createPromisePool,  a  function  that  maintains  a  promise  pool  as  described above. It returns an object with add and emptyPromise methods. The former adds a promise to the pool and the latter returns a promise that resolves when the pool empties:  var $ = require 'jquery-deferred' ;      function createPromisePool  {      var inProgress = [],             waitingForEmpty = [];          return {         add: function promise {             inProgress.push promise ;                 promise.always function  {                 var i;                 for  i = 0; i < inProgress.length; i++ {                         if  inProgress[i] === promise {                         inProgress.splice i, 1 ;                         break;                     }                 }                  if  inProgress.length === 0 {                         for  i = 0; i < waitingForEmpty.length; i++ {                         waitingForEmpty[i].resolve  ;                     }                     waitingForEmpty = [];                 }             } ;         },          emptyPromise: function  {                 var deferred = $.Deferred  ;             waitingForEmpty.push deferred ;             return deferred.promise  ;         }     }; }  require is a core node.js function for loading JavaScript from another file. inProgress holds a list of outstanding promises. waitingForEmpty holds a list of deferreds whose promises have been given to pool observers that want to know when the pool is empty. Add the given promise to the list of in-progress tasks. When the promise fires, remove it from the in-progress promises.  A Promise Pool with an emptyPromise Method      29   If we now have no promises in progress, resolve all waiting deferreds. The emptyPromise function creates a new deferred, adds it to the list of waiters, and returns its promise.  Using the Promise Pool Suppose you’re using the Express node HTTP server and you have a function called handleRequest that takes an incoming request and returns a promise that fires once the request has been dealt with. Server code that uses a promise pool might have frag‐ ments like this:  var express = require 'express' ,     app = express  ,     pool = createPromisePool  ,     shuttingDown = false;  app.get ' ', function req, res {     if  shuttingDown {         res.redirect 'http:  example.com' ;         }     else {         pool.add handleRequest req, res  ;         } } ;  app.get ' shutdown', function req, res {     if  shuttingDown === false {         shuttingDown = true;         pool.add flushAvatarCache   ;             pool.add sendShutdownEmail   ;         pool.add flushLogs   ;         pool.emptyPromise  .done                  function  {                 res.send 200 ;                     process.exit 0 ;             }          ;     }     else {         res.send 200 ;         } } ;  app.listen 9999 ; If the server is shutting down when a request arrives, redirect the request to some other URL  alternatively, we could fail the request . The important thing is to stop processing requests—to not add any more request promises to the pool.  30      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Otherwise, call handleRequest and add the promise it returns to the pool. On shutdown, arrange for final tasks to be done, adding the promise for each one to the pool of outstanding work. When all outstanding work is finished, exit the node process. The server status  200  is not written back to the client until the service has really been halted. We could have returned a 200 status immediately, but by waiting until everything is done, the client knows their call succeeded. If a shutdown request arrives while we are already shutting down, we simply return a 200 immediately  see the challenges below .  Challenges 1. Change the emptyPromise function so it consists of a single return statement. Hint:  pass an initialization function to $.Deferred.  2. What will happen if the in-progress pool is empty when emptyPromise is called? 3. Change emptyPromise to accept a Boolean argument, checkImmediately. If check Immediately is true and the in-progress pool is empty when emptyPromise is called, it should return an already resolved promise.  4. The processing of a shutdown request is too simplistic because it may start functions like flushAvatarCache before all existing HTTP requests are finished. Change the shutdown code so that it first waits for the pool of HTTP GET requests to empty, then adds shutdown promises to the pool, and then waits again for the pool to empty before exiting.  5. Change createPromisePool to allow the caller to pass a function. The function should be evaluated each time an outstanding promise fires and if it returns true, resolve all the waiting deferreds. You might like to pass the function the number of items in the inProgress list, or even the list itself  if you’re the trusting type .  6. In createPromisePool the inProgress list is linearly scanned and then spliced  in the always callback  each time a request finishes. This will be very inefficient if you are processing many simultaneous requests. How could you change inProgress to be a JavaScript object so you could then use delete to quickly remove the completed promise? Don’t forget to also change the inProgress.length === 0 test.  7. If a shutdown request arrives while we are already shutting down, the code above returns a 200 immediately. This might be problematic: such a 200 response actually only indicates that a shutdown is in progress, not that it has completed. A better approach would be to only return a  200 when the currently running shutdown process has completed. Change the shutdown code so that additional shutdown requests  receive  a  200  response  only  when  the  in-progress  shutdown  sequence  A Promise Pool with an emptyPromise Method      31   completes. Your code should work no matter how many shutdown requests are received during the shutdown process.  Displaying Google Maps The Google Maps API makes it extremely easy to add map images to web applications. Just add a src attribute containing a latitude and longitude of a location to an HTML   tag and Google takes care of the rest. The direct approach is extremely convenient and easy, but is likely too simplistic in practice. One issue is that network requests are slow, particularly on mobile devices. Also, the Google API is no longer free or may be limited by a quota, so reducing API calls by caching can save money and or keep an application working correctly for longer. Caching can have strong benefits for location-aware applications since many of us are creatures of habit, repeatedly visiting certain places like home, the office, the gym, and favorite restaurants. In this section, we’ll build a function that returns a function that manages a cache of fetched maps. As you’d expect, the returned function does its work without hitting the Google API unless necessary. We’ll end up being able to write code like this:  var fetchMap = createMapCache  ,     latitude = 52.203558,     longitude = 0.119436;  fetchMap latitude, longitude .done function map {        Use the map. } ;  The first time you call fetchMap with a particular  latitude, longitude  pair, the map is fetched from Google. Thereafter, calls for the same location will quickly return a locally cached map. We’ll build a three-level solution, storing a data URI locally. If you’re unfamiliar with them, data URIs are a nice way to easily store image data  as base 64 strings  in memory in a format that can be used in HTML   tags. Our approach will store the coordinates and data URI of the last-requested location in memory as JavaScript variables. When called, our lookup function will first check the last coordinates and return the stored data URI if the location matches. If the in-memory location does not match, we’ll check Chrome local storage. Only if that also fails will we go to the Google API. On any cache miss  either in-memory or local storage, or both  we’ll make sure to save the newly retrieved data URI as appropriate.  32      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   The use of Chrome local storage for the middle layer of our approach is an unimportant detail. Please don’t let it put you off if you’re not a Chrome user. The example is worth considering in any case, and you should be able to swap in your own middle level if necessary. First of all, here are a couple of utility functions to get and set values from Chrome local storage. We covered this topic in “Accessing Chrome Local Storage” on page 25, so these functions should look familiar.  function localStorageGet keys {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;     chrome.storage.local.get keys, function result {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve result ;         }     } ;     return deferred.promise  ; }  function localStorageSet items {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;     chrome.storage.local.set items, function  {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve  ;         }     } ;     return deferred.promise  ; }  We’ll also need a promise-returning function that does a Google Maps API lookup of a map, given a latitude and longitude:  function googleLookup latitude, longitude {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         url =  'http:  maps.googleapis.com maps api staticmap?center=' +                    latitude + ',' + longitude +                '&zoom=10&size=400x200&sensor=false' ,         TIMEOUT = 1500,         xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;      xhr.open 'GET', url, true ;     xhr.send  ;     xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer';          var requestTimer = setTimeout function  {             xhr.abort  ;  Displaying Google Maps      33           deferred.reject  ;     }, TIMEOUT ;      xhr.onload = function  {         clearTimeout requestTimer ;         if  xhr.status === 200 {             deferred.resolve                  'data:image png;base64,' +                 base64ArrayBuffer xhr.response                   ;         }         else {             deferred.reject  ;         }     };      xhr.onerror = function  {         clearTimeout requestTimer ;         deferred.reject  ;     };      return deferred.promise  ; }  The URL here is the endpoint for the Google Maps API. We create our own XMLHttpRequest object so that we can set its responseType to arraybuffer. Normally we’d use a $.ajax call for convenience, but the data Type option for $.ajax does not currently allow for receiving an ArrayBuffer. We set up a timeout to reject the deferred if the Google API call doesn’t complete within TIMEOUT milliseconds. When the data becomes available from Google, we turn it into a data URI. The base64ArrayBuffer function that converts an ArrayBuffer to base 64 is given in Appendix C.  Finally, here’s the main function, createMapCache. It returns a map-fetching function that maintains a cache:  function createMapCache  {      var lastKey, lastDataURI;          return function latitude, longitude {             var deferred = $.Deferred  ;          var getMap = function latitude, longitude {                 var key = 'map-' + latitude + '-' + longitude;                  if  key === lastKey {                     deferred.resolve lastDataURI ;  34      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes               }             else {                 localStorageGet key .then                          function obj {                         if  obj.hasOwnProperty key  {                                 lastDataURI = obj[key];                             lastKey = key;                             deferred.resolve lastDataURI ;                         }                         else {                                key not in local storage, use Google.                             googleLookup latitude, longitude .then                                  function dataURI {                                     var store = {};                                     store[key] = dataURI;                                     localStorageSet store ;                                         lastDataURI = dataURI;                                     lastKey = key;                                     deferred.resolve dataURI ;                                 },                                 function error {                                     deferred.reject error ;                                 }                              ;                         }                     },                     function error {                         deferred.reject error ;                     }                  ;             }         };          if  arguments.length === 2 {                 getMap latitude, longitude ;         }         else {             navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition                      function position {                     getMap position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude ;                 },                 function error {                     deferred.reject error ;                 }              ;         }          return deferred.promise  ;     }; }  Displaying Google Maps      35   lastKey keeps track of the last key we used  in local storage  so we can reply quickly to a repeated request. Similarly, lastDataURI is the value associated with the last key. Return a function that takes a latitude and a longitude. getMap is the function that does all the work. First, we choose a key for local storage. The map- prefix aims to reduce the risk of key collision with other apps. The first check is a simple synchronous test against the location we were called with last time. If the in-memory lookup doesn’t work, arrange to look in the local storage. If we find the key in local storage, remember it and return its value via resolving the deferred. Otherwise, the key was not in local storage so we call the Google Maps API. If that is successful, we store the new value in local storage and in the lastKey and lastDataURI variables. The function we’re returning can accept latitude and longitude arguments, so if we’re provided with these, call getMap directly. Otherwise, get the user’s latitude and longitude from the browser. We assume here that you have a modern browser, with support for navigator.geolocation.  Challenges 1. Storing just one last data URI in memory is pretty stingy. Add an LRU data struc‐  ture to store a larger number of recent results.  2. getMap is the only function in this book that calls a promise-returning function but  ignores the returned promise. Can you see where? Why is the promise ignored?  3. Error handling in the above could be greatly improved. Errors can arise when asking the user to permit location information for the application, in talking to Chrome’s local storage, and  for several reasons  in the Google Maps API. Add a well-defined error object that the deferred is rejected with that will always allow the caller to detect what went wrong.  4. One shortcoming of the above code is that it may make unnecessary simultaneous calls to the Google Maps API. Suppose a first call triggers a query to the Google API and that while that network request is still in progress, a second call to our function arrives for the same location. The second call will trigger an identical request to the Google API. This is not too hard to prevent. Add a JavaScript object that will store deferreds from requests in progress. When a new call arrives, check to see if the coordinates correspond to an outstanding request and, if so, return its promise.  36      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   You’ll need to add cleanup code via a callback on each deferred you create to take the deferred out of the set of in-progress deferreds. This is an excellent example of a common pattern: put deferreds into a data structure as you create  or receive  them and add callbacks to them to remove them from the data structure after they fire. We saw this in “A Promise Pool with an emptyPromise Method” on page 28 and will encounter it again in “Short-Term Memoization of In-Progress Function Calls” on page 52.  Communicating with a Web Worker JavaScript is single-threaded. Calling long-running functions, whether client side or server side, can have a severe usability impact. Client side, the browser UI freezes while the call is in progress. Server side, processing of other requests stops while the long- running function executes. New connections may be missed. Client side, the traditional approach to alleviating this situation has been to perform computations in parts, giving the browser a chance to attend to other tasks. This is an unnatural approach to programming, often made more awkward by the use of  set Timeout to schedule the next phase of a computation. Web workers are designed to fix this problem. A web worker is simply a separate Java‐ Script thread, spawned by the main thread. Communication with the web worker is done using message passing. At any point, the main thread can send a message to a worker, and vice versa. In this example, we’ll make it possible to send a message to a web worker and receive a promise that will fire with the reply. This is very useful because the promise provides a formal mechanism for receiving a reply to a message. When your code makes a call to a web worker, it can immediately arrange for the processing of the response instead of fielding a reply elsewhere in your code  which will likely involve having to figure out what it’s a reply to, as well as reestablishing the context in which you originally sent the message .  The Web Worker Code Below is the code that will be run in the web worker thread:  var METHODS = {         add: function callback, payload {         callback { result: payload[0] + payload[1] } ;     },      ping: function callback {         log 'Ping command received, replying with pong.' ;         callback { result: 'pong' } ;  Communicating with a Web Worker      37       } };  addEventListener 'message', function event {         var job = event.data;     if  METHODS.hasOwnProperty job.method  {         METHODS[job.method]              function result {                 result.requestId = job.requestId;                 postMessage result ;                 },             job.payload ;     }     else {             log "Attempt to call unknown method '" + job.method + "'." ;     } } ;  function log message {         postMessage {         message: message,         type: 'log'     } ; }  The METHODS object has a key for each of the methods that the main thread can call in the web worker. There are two functions: one to add two arguments passed in the payload and one to respond to a ping command with the string pong. The  addEventListener  section  is  the  key  to  the  coordination  of  incoming messages  and  outgoing  results.  It  examines  the  incoming  message  for  the method to call and calls the corresponding method  in the METHODS object  with a callback and the message payload. It takes the result of the call and sends it back to the main thread along with the request ID from the incoming message. The postMessage function is part of the web worker specification. It is used to send a message back to the code that created the web worker. It is possible that you might want your web worker to process messages that don’t need replies and have nothing to do with deferreds, request IDs, etc. If so, those can easily be handled here. For now, we’re just logging the reception of an unrecognized message. The log function illustrates that the web worker can still send an unsolicited message to the main thread. This will be used if an attempt is made to call an unknown method. The ping function also logs its usage.  Let’s suppose we’ve stored this code in a file called examples src web-worker.js. We’ll need the filename below.  38      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Creating a Web Worker The request ID in each message is obviously what ties together requests and their replies. You can see how the ID is used in createWebWorker, below, which creates a web worker and arranges to send it messages. createWebWorker returns an object with add and ping methods on it, both of which return promises. function createWebWorker sourceFile {          var requests = {},    Key is request id, value is a deferred.         requestId = 0,    Incremented on each message sent.         worker = new Worker sourceFile ,          sendJob = function method, payload {                 var deferred = $.Deferred  ,                 id = requestId++;             requests[id] = deferred;             worker.postMessage {                 method: method,                 payload: payload,                 requestId: id             } ;             return deferred.promise  ;         },          handleResponse = function response {                 var deferred, id;             if  response.hasOwnProperty 'requestId'  {                 id = response.requestId;                 if  requests.hasOwnProperty id  {                     deferred = requests[id];                     delete requests[id];                     if  response.hasOwnProperty 'result'  {                         deferred.resolve response.result ;                     }                     else {                         deferred.reject response.error ;                     }                 }             }             else {                    An unsolicited message from the worker.                  if  response.type === 'log' {                     console.log 'Worker says:', response.message ;                 }                 else {                     console.log 'Unknown message from worker:', response ;                 }             }         };  Communicating with a Web Worker      39       worker.addEventListener 'message', function event {             handleResponse event.data ;     } ;      return {             add: function a, b {             return sendJob 'add', [a, b] ;         },          ping: function  {             return sendJob 'ping' ;         }     }; }  The name of the source file containing the web worker code must be passed to createWebWorker, which passes it to the Worker constructor. The sendJob function is used to send a message to the web worker. Each message specifies what method should be run by the web worker, its payload  which may be  undefined , and a request ID. A deferred is created and stored in the  re quests object using the request ID. Storing the deferreds associated with the in- progress tasks requested of the web worker will allow us to pass the eventual result to our caller. The handleResponse function is used to process all incoming messages from the web worker. These are first checked to see if they contain a request ID. If so, the deferred corresponding to the request is taken from the requests object and it is either resolved or rejected depending on the presence of a result in the message. Incoming  messages  that  do  not  have  a  request  ID  can  also  be  handled,  as illustrated by the  log message. The log messages are a handy way of getting information out of a web worker  which does not have its own console object or other mechanism for providing diagnostics . Add an event listener that receives messages from the worker. All messages are passed to handleResponse. The createWebWorker function returns an object with add and ping attributes that can be used to call the corresponding function in the web worker. Both these methods return a promise, as you would  hopefully!  expect.  Using It Finally, here’s an example of how you could use the above:  var worker = createWebWorker 'examples src web-worker.js' ;      $.when worker.add 3, 4 , worker.ping         40      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   .done      function total, pingReply {         console.log 'Total = ' + total + '. Ping reply = ' + pingReply + '.' ;     }  ; First, we create a web worker via a call to createWebWorker. The argument is the name of the file containing the web worker code. The jQuery $.when function is used to coordinate the result of the two promises obtained by calling worker.add and worker.ping.  The above produces the following output on the console log, as you would expect:  Worker says: Ping command received, replying with pong. Total = 7. Ping reply = pong.  Summary The above approach takes nothing away from the informal ad hoc messaging used between the main thread and its web workers. The main thread and the web worker are both still free to use postMessage at any time. Our code just adds some explicit methods that can be called in the web worker and arranges, in the main thread, for the corre‐ sponding functions to return promises. Any incoming message with a request ID is assumed to be a response to such a method call. Messages from the web worker without request IDs are handled separately  as with the log messages .  Challenges 1. Change createWebWorker to log a message if it receives a response containing a  request ID that is unknown.  2. Let’s add some timing information to createWebWorker. Change it to store a time‐ stamp for each request when it is received. In handleResponse, use console.log to log the elapsed processing time for each request. Next, add a slow request method to the web worker  e.g., use iteration to compute large Fibonacci numbers . Then, write a loop to send 1000 of these requests to the web worker and examine the logged elapsed request times. What’s going on?  3. If the code run by a web worker is CPU-bound, once it starts processing a message, it won’t react to further incoming messages until the currently underway compu‐ tation is done. In this scenario, instead of sending multiple messages to a web worker, we could maintain a queue of requests and only send the worker another when the previous request finishes. Change createWebWorker to work in this way. 4. Add to your simple timing statistics to also keep track of how long each request  spends in the queue before being sent to the web worker.  Communicating with a Web Worker      41   5. Enhance your queued version of createWebWorker to create a pool of identical web workers. The thread pool size can be passed as an argument. When a request comes in, add it to the request queue and then look for an available worker to process it. Send 1000 messages to the pool of web workers and examine the request times.  Using Web Sockets Web sockets are a second example of free-form messaging, in which a client and server can send unsolicited messages at any time. There is no built-in formal mechanism for making a call and getting a response. As in “Communicating with a Web Worker” on page 37, we’ll include a request ID each time we send a request, and the server will send it back with the result of the call.  The Web Socket Server Here’s a node.js server to handle incoming web socket requests:  var port = 9999,     $ = require 'jquery-deferred' ,     express = require 'express' ,     app = express  ,     server = require 'http' .createServer app ,     io = require 'socket.io' .listen server ;  var METHODS = {         add: function payload {         return $.Deferred  .resolve payload[0] + payload[1] .promise  ;     },     subtract: function payload {         return $.Deferred  .resolve payload[0] - payload[1] .promise  ;     },     divide: function payload {         if  payload[1] === 0 {                 return $.Deferred  .reject 'Cannot divide by zero.' .promise  ;         }         else {             return $.Deferred  .resolve payload[0]   payload[1] .promise  ;         }     } };  io.sockets.on 'connection', function  socket {     socket.on 'request', function request {         var method = request.method,             func = METHODS[method];             if  func {             func request.payload                      .done function result {  42      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes                       socket.emit 'response', {                             payload: result,                         requestId: request.requestId                     } ;                 }                  .fail function error {                     socket.emit 'response', {                             error: 'Calling ' + method + ' failed: ' + error,                         requestId: request.requestId                     } ;                 }              ;         }         else {             socket.emit 'response', {                     error: 'Unknown method: ' + method,                 requestId: request.requestId             } ;         }     } ; } ;  server.listen port, '0.0.0.0' ; The METHODS object contains the functions that a client can call and expect replies from. Notice that each of the functions returns a promise that has already been resolved  or rejected . This is just to illustrate that, server side, we expect to be making calls to promise-returning functions. In more typical circumstances, the node server would make calls to other asynchronous methods that returned promises that the called methods would fire themselves. The div function checks the denominator of the division, and returns a rejected promise in the case of zero. We look up the method name on all incoming request requests. Note that as in “Communicating  with  a  Web  Worker”  on  page  37,  we  are  not  precluding  a situation in which the client wants to send other kinds of requests, such as those not requiring a response. Supposing  it  exists,  we  call  the  local   server-side   function,  which  returns  a promise. We use done and fail callbacks to process its result or error. If the call was successful, we send a response back to the client with the result and also the request ID from the original request. Returning the original request ID  allows  the  client   see  below   to  route  the  result  to  its  correct   deferred  destination when it arrives. If the call fails, we send a response back to the client with an error and the request ID from the original request, as above.  Using Web Sockets      43   If the client asked us to call a method we don’t know about, we send back an error, again including the original request ID.  The Web Socket Client Below is client code that knows how to send requests and handle responses. It also has an example main function that sends off four requests and logs the results. A cleaner design would separate request handling  makeRequest and handleResponse  from the example usage  main .  var $ = require 'jquery-deferred' ,     socket = require 'socket.io-client' .connect 'http:  localhost:9999' ,     requests = {},         requestId = 0;      function makeRequest method, payload {         var deferred = requests[requestId] = $.Deferred  ;     socket.emit 'request', {         method: method,         payload: payload,         requestId: requestId++         } ;     return deferred.promise  ; }  function handleResponse response {     var deferred = requests[response.requestId];         if  response.error {         deferred.reject response.error ;         }     else {         deferred.resolve response.payload ;         }     delete requests[response.requestId];     }  function main  {     var finishedCount = 0,             possiblyExit = function  {             if  ++finishedCount === 4 {                 process.exit  ;             }         };      makeRequest 'add', [20, 15] .then              function result { console.log '20 + 15 = ', result ; },         function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }      .always possiblyExit ;          makeRequest 'subtract', [20, 15] .then          function result { console.log '20 - 15 = ', result ; },  44      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes           function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }      .always possiblyExit ;      makeRequest 'multiply', [20, 15] .then          function result { console.log '20 * 15 = ', result ; },         function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }      .always possiblyExit ;      makeRequest 'divide', [20, 0] .then          function result { console.log '20   0 = ', result ; },         function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }      .always possiblyExit ; }  socket.on 'connect', function  {         socket.on 'response', handleResponse ;     main  ; } ; requests will be keyed by request ID and its values will be outstanding deferreds. These correspond to server requests that have not yet received an answer. requestId will be a unique ID sent in each server request. The makeRequest function does the work of sending a request to the server. It creates a deferred  whose promise will be returned , puts it into requests, and sends a message to the the server. The message to the server includes the request ID, which is then incremented to be ready for sending the next request  if any . When a response arrives, its corresponding deferred is found in requests. If the response contains an error, the original deferred is rejected. If not, the original deferred is resolved with the result from the server. The entry in the  requests object is removed, seeing as its deferred has now either been resolved or rejected. In the main client code, we manually keep track of how many of our requests have been answered and exit when all responses are in. See the challenges below for more on this. Each time we call makeRequest with a method and a payload, we use then on the returned promise to set up further processing of the server response. We add a call to  possiblyExit to each promise. When the last call to finish completes, the client will exit. By using always, we make sure possiblyExit is called regardless of whether the server call succeeded or resulted in an error. Once the web socket connection is made, arrange to process incoming messages using handleResponse.  Using Web Sockets      45   Running the client code produces the following on the console, as you’d expect:  20 + 15 =  35 20 - 15 =  5 Oops! Unknown method: multiply Oops! Calling divide failed: Cannot divide by zero.  Challenges 1. What trivial change could you make to the server code to allow called functions   i.e., those in METHODS  to return results that are not promises?  2. What would happen if the server had a bug and didn’t send a request ID in a re‐ sponse, or sent a request ID that the client never sent, or sent a request ID that had already been used? Fix the client code to handle these situations as best you can.  3. In the code above, the client can make a call to the server and get a response, but not vice versa. Make it possible for the server to send a request to the client and get a response.  4. The  example  client  code  sends  four  requests  to  the  server  and  uses  a  variable  finishedCount  to count how many responses it has received and to know when to exit. An alternative approach would be to write that part of the client as follows:  function main  {     return $.when          makeRequest 'add', [20, 15] .then              function result { console.log '20 + 15 = ', result ; },             function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }          ,         makeRequest 'subtract', [20, 15] .then              function result { console.log '20 - 15 = ', result ; },             function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }          ,         makeRequest 'multiply', [20, 15] .then              function result { console.log '20 * 15 = ', result ; },             function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }          ,         makeRequest 'divide', [20, 0] .then              function result { console.log '20   0 = ', result ; },             function error { console.log 'Oops!', error ; }                ; }  socket.on 'connect', function  {     socket.on 'response', handleResponse ;     main  .always function  {         process.exit  ;     } ; } ;  46      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   This is much more concise. There’s only one small problem: it won’t work! Why not?  5. Read the jQuery source code and find the line that causes the above $.when ap‐ proach to fail. How could you change $.when to not behave that way, and what would that mean for code that used it? Given that the signature of $.when doesn’t permit  backward-compatible  changes,  how  could  you  write  a  more  flexible $.when? How could the call signature of $.when have been written to allow future changes so we wouldn’t be stuck with this behavior?  Automatically Retrying Failing Deferred Calls These days a common need is to write code that talks to services that may be briefly unavailable. If an error of some kind occurs, the correct  and documented  action to take is just to retry the original call a little later. Examples include the APIs for Amazon’s S3 service and Twitter. Transient API failures occur fairly frequently with both those services. Below is a function where you pass a context  i.e., a value for this , a function to be called, and some arguments for the function. If the function call fails, it is retried re‐ peatedly after increasing delays. The original failure value is returned  via a promise that is rejected  if all attempts to call the function fail:  function retryingCaller   * context, function, args... *   {     var context = arguments[0],         func = arguments[1],         args = arguments.slice 2 ,         deferred = $.Deferred  ,         rejectValue,         delays = [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0],         attempt = 0,          wait = function timeout {                 var d = $.Deferred  ;             setTimeout d.resolve, timeout ;             return d.promise  ;         },          error = function value {                 if  rejectValue === undefined {                 rejectValue = value;                 }             if  attempt === delays.length {                 deferred.reject rejectValue ;                 }             else {                 call  ;                 }  Automatically Retrying Failing Deferred Calls      47           },          call = function  {             wait delays[attempt++] .done                      function  {                     $.when func.apply context, args  .then                          deferred.resolve,                             error                          ;                 }              ;         };      call  ;     return deferred.promise  ; }  This is the wait function we wrote earlier, in “A Replacement for the setTimeout Function” on page 21. error will be run each time a promise returned by the underlying function is rejected. Its job is to save the first reject value and to either reject the master deferred  whose promise is returned by retryingCaller  or to arrange for the underlying function to be called again. Save the first reject value  see the challenges below for different approaches to rejecting the master deferred . If the number of allowed attempts has been reached, reject the master deferred with the original reject value. We still have some attempts left, so call the underlying function again. Wait for the next delay time to elapse before calling the underlying function. If the underlying function runs without error, pass its return value along to the master deferred. If the underlying function hits an error, call our error function, which will either arrange for a retry or reject the master deferred.  Challenges 1. Make it possible for the caller to specify the delay intervals. 2. If all calls to the passed function fail, the promise returned by  retryingCaller should be rejected with the error value from the first failing call. But there’s one condition under which this is violated. Figure out what can go wrong and fix the bug.  3. Instead of rejecting the deferred with the original error value, reject it with the final  value, or keep a list of the failure values and reject it with a list of all failures.  48      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   4. Our code is circular: the call function arranges to invoke error if something goes wrong, but error invokes call if the maximum number of attempts has not been reached. Is there a way this circularity could cause the stack to fill with invocations of call, error, and the function passed to retryingCaller?  5. Make it possible for the caller to pass an error-checking function. Each time the underlying function fails, pass the error value to the checking function. If it returns true, continue to retry the underlying function; otherwise, reject the master de‐ ferred. This allows a caller to provide an error-checking function that, for example, could cause retryingCaller to retry the function on HTTP 500  Internal Server Error , 502  Bad Gateway , and 504  Gateway Timeout  errors, but to not retry on any other HTTP error. As another possibility, an error checker could allow just two 404  Not Found  error retries, as illustrated below:  function tester  {     var count = 0, max404errors = 2;     return function error {         return error.status === 404 ? count++ < max404errors : true;     }; }  Memoization Memoization is a simple technique for greatly speeding up repeat calls to an idempotent function. Informally, an idempotent function is one that returns the same value each time you call it with the same arguments. In those cases, it is safe to store  “memoize”  the function’s result the first time it is called and to return the known result thereafter for identical calls. Ignoring issues of the memory used to store results, memoization of computationally expensive functions has the happy result of delivering massive speed gains. Simple memoization is easy to implement in many programming languages, including JavaScript. At first glance, though, it seems like memoization in the context of deferreds might be more involved. There are three cases we need to consider:  a. The function to be memoized has never before been called with the given argument. b. The  function  has  already  been  called  with  this  argument,  but  the  promise  the  memoizing function originally returned has not yet been resolved.  c. The function has already been called with this argument, and the promise that was  originally returned has been resolved.  Memoization      49   In addition, if we want to be able to memoize arbitrary functions, we’ll have to deal with functions that return promises, functions that return nonpromises, and functions that can return either. Fortunately, it turns out that this is one of the rare cases where a very simple solution solves what seems like a tricky situation:  function memoize func {     var promises = {};          return function arg {         if  promises.hasOwnProperty arg  === false {                 promises[arg] = $.when func arg  .promise  ;             }         return promises[arg];         }; }  The  promises object holds promises corresponding to calls already made to func. When a call is made, check for an existing promise for the given argument. If the promise doesn’t exist, this is the first time we’ve been called with this argument. Call func on the argument, use $.when to create a promise that will be resolved with the result, and store the new promise. Return the promise for this call.  Discussion Firstly, we’ve made a simplifying assumption: that func will not be called with JavaScript objects  lists are objects too  as an argument. See the challenges below if this makes you feel better. If you’ve encountered memoization before, the code above should seem completely unremarkable. But, as simple as it seems, this example deserves some discussion. How does this simple function handle all three cases listed above? Firstly, it turns out that cases  b  and  c  above can be treated identically. One of the beauties of deferreds is that you can use them in blissful ignorance of whether they have been resolved yet or not. In the case of  b , we have an unresolved promise in the promises object. It has already been returned to at least one caller. If another call is made with the same argument, the same unresolved promise is again returned. When the result arrives, both callers will get it. In the case of  c , the promise corresponding to the passed argument has already fired, but we’re still holding the promise and we can simply return it again. The promise already contains the result, which will be passed immediately to any additional callbacks added to it by our caller.  50      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   In normal memoization, a cache of known results is maintained. In our case, we keep a cache of promises. Because we wrap the call to func inside $.when, the function re‐ turned by memoize will always return a promise, even if func does not. This is a departure from strict memoization. To repeat, the result from func is not returned: instead, we return a promise that will resolve with that result. It is the use of $.when that allows us to ignore the issue of whether func returns a promise or not. Because $.when handles both cases, we don’t need to check the returned value.  Avoiding the Dogpile Effect Let’s compare deferred-based memoization to memoization without deferreds. Without deferreds, what happens if a first call comes in with an argument X, but before func X  has finished computing there is another call with argument X? Then another, and another, and maybe thousands of others? The nondeferred code winds up calling func X  many times. That is, it does exactly the thing we are trying to avoid in the first place! This is informally known as the “dogpile effect.” It can result in all sorts of trouble, including memory exhaustion, CPU overload, or a form of denial of service attack. With deferreds though, we immediately have a placeholder for the result of the first call  with any given argument  to the memoized function. With that promise safely stored, we can just return it to the hordes of callers that hit the service before the result is in. When the result finally arrives and the deferred for that call is resolved, all the callers will receive it. Deferreds solve this problem so cleanly, without you having to lift a finger, that you may not have even realized there was a potential problem there at all. Neat. This effortless avoidance of the dogpile effect is a great example of the value of deferreds.  Challenges 1. Modify memoize to allow a context argument to be passed as well as a function. The  context should be used as this when func is called.  2. What happens if func is called with a JavaScript object? 3. How would you modify the above code if func took two arguments instead of one?  What if it took any number of arguments, each of arbitrary type?  4. The returned function will give the same promise to multiple callers. Will this create  a problem if callers each add their own callbacks to the promise?  5. How would you change  memoize if you wanted to be stricter and only return a  promise when func did?  6. What would be the effect of not wrapping the func arg  call in $.when?  Memoization      51   7. The promises object can only grow in size. It would be good to discard results that have not been accessed recently. Add a housekeeping function to memoize that’s invoked periodically by setInterval to delete items from promises that haven’t been accessed recently.  Short-Term Memoization of In-Progress Function Calls Regular functions compute their results each time they’re called. At the other extreme, memoized functions can remember earlier results forever and never recompute any‐ thing. In this example we’ll consider the middle ground, functions that are only briefly memoized. An application built by the authors consisted of multiple front-end HTTP servers using RPC  to  internal  servers  to  fulfill  API  requests.  One  HTTP  API  request  was  called createUser. In a typical setup, a request to create a user in a system will either get a successful result upon user creation or an error if the user already exists. But it is also possible that while a request to create a specific user is underway, another request arrives to create the same username. A simplistic outcome in this situation might be that the first request receives a successful status code and the second results in a database trans‐ action error that is translated into a UserExists error. We can easily improve on this, though, if we’re using deferreds to create users. When a request arrives to create a user and a promise-returning function is called to do the work, we can keep track of the promise as well as returning it to our caller. Then, if a second call arrives to create the same user before the first has finished, we simply return the same promise. At that point, our code will have returned the same promise twice and our callers will both receive the same result. Once the original request has finished, we can forget the promise and allow subsequent requests to flow through the system as normal. Here’s the code:  var promises = {};      function createUser username {     if  promises.hasOwnProperty username  {             return promises[username];     }     else {         var promise = internalCreateUser username ;             promises[username] = promise;             promise.always function  {             delete promises[username];             } ;         return promise;     } }  52      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   The  promises  object  holds  promises  corresponding  to  in-progress  create User requests. This is exactly as in “Memoization” on page 49. createUser  first  checks  to  see  if  promises  contains  a  promise  for  the  given username, and if so it simply returns it. This is the case where a second  or third, etc.  request for an identical username arrives while a first request is in progress. If there is no call in progress, a call is made to the internal function that does the work of making a user. This function is assumed to return a promise. The promise from internalCreateUser is stored in the promises object. A callback is added to the promise returned by internalCreateUser that will remove the promise from promises. As a result, subsequent calls to createUser will trigger another call to internalCreateUser, even if the call has been made before.  createUser Is Not Idempotent In regular memoization, the function being memoized is idempotent: the result of a function call is assumed to never change and can be remembered for all time. But createUser is not idempotent. When it is called with a nonexistent username, it returns a value to indicate the user was created. On subsequent calls  with the same username , it returns a value to indicate the user already existed. So we’re not doing regular  per‐ manent  memoizing of the createUser result. We’re just making sure that if there’s an in-progress call for a given argument, we use its result instead of making a second simultaneous and identical call to  internalCreateUser. The memoization is short- term; it only lasts as long as the function call is outstanding. It’s a funny kind of memo‐ ization, because we’re not storing the result of the function call, we’re effectively storing the in-progress function call. We return to this discussion in “Promises Are First-Class Objects for Function Calls” on page 79.  Challenges 1. What  undesirable  outcome  could  occur  if  the  promise  from  internalCreate  User were put into the promises object after the always callback is set up?  2. The problem in the previous challenge is an example that illustrates a general prin‐ ciple of maintaining data structures that hold deferreds and promises. Can you generalize our specific problem to arrive at the principle?  3. Think about the similarities and differences between the short-term in-progress function call memoization above and regular caching with result expiry after a fixed time.  Short-Term Memoization of In-Progress Function Calls      53   Streaming Promise Events In this example we’ll do some curious things in order to build up a tool we’ll put to good use in a later example. Take a look at the following function and figure out what it does  and doesn’t do!  before reading on:  function simpleEventStream promises {     var i, deferred = $.Deferred  ,         stream = function  {             deferred.notify.apply deferred, arguments ;         };      for  i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i].done stream .fail stream .progress stream ;     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  There are a couple of odd things going on here. The function accepts a list of promises and it adds the same stream function to all of the done, fail, and progress callback lists. The stream function calls the notify function on the deferred whose promise is returned by simpleEventStream. So, every time one of the passed promises is resolved, rejected, or notified of progress, the arguments of that call will be passed on as progress events on the returned promise. In other words, simpleEventStream takes all events generated by a given set of promises and delivers them, as they occur, to its caller via a stream of progress events on its returned promise. But there’s something else that’s odd about simpleEventStream. It never calls resolve or reject on the deferred it creates! Hmm…shouldn’t that be illegal, or something? Not really. There’s no rule that says a deferred has to be fired. Of course they usually are, but we have a case where we’re using a deferred for something slightly different than a one- time conclusion.  Delivering More Information There’s an obvious first improvement we could make to the event streamer: report the index of the promise that created the event as well as whether the promise was resolved, rejected, or notified. That’s an easy addition:  function eventStream promises {     var i, deferred = $.Deferred  ,         callNotify = function index, type {             return function  {                 deferred.notify index, type, arguments ;             };         };  54      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes       for  i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i]             .done callNotify i, 'resolve'               .fail callNotify i, 'reject'               .progress callNotify i, 'notify'  ;     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  Here, any progress callback added to the promise returned by eventStream will be called with the index of the promise that created the event, the type of event  resolution, rejection, or progress notification , and the arguments provided to the promise. If you’re wondering what use this could possibly be, imagine you had a set of promises and you wanted to log all their events, in order. You could of course manually add done, fail, and progress logging functions to each promise and then collate the output, but it would be simpler to just pass the promises to  eventStream and add a single  pro gress function to do the logging. That may not seem particularly useful, but we’re not done yet.  Delegating the Event Stream The eventStream function is interesting, but so far it doesn’t seem all that useful unless you want to observe promise events. The promise we received from eventStream never fires. What if we wanted it to be resolved or rejected under certain circumstances? Here’s  a  slight  variation  on  the  above,  delegateEventStream,  which  also  returns  a promise:  function delegateEventStream promises, eventHandler {         var i, deferred = $.Deferred  ,         callHandler = function index, type {                 return function  {                 eventHandler index, type, arguments, deferred ;                 };         };      for  i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i]             .done callHandler i, 'resolve'               .fail callHandler i, 'reject'               .handler callHandler i, 'notify'  ;     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  Streaming Promise Events      55   A little explanation is probably in order:  delegateEventStream must be passed an array of promises and an event handler function. The callHandler function returns a function that will call the event handler. Each  time  the  event  handler  function  is  called,  it  is  passed  the  index  of  the promise, the type of event  'resolve', 'reject', or 'notify' , the arguments involved, and the deferred delegateEventStream created.  As you may have noticed, although delegateEventStream creates a deferred, it not only never resolves it or rejects it, it also never even calls notify on it as the earlier examples did. Even odder, it passes the deferred off to an unspecified event handler function. What’s going on?  To Be Continued… As unsatisfying as it might be, we’re going to leave this little experiment for now. You can take solace from the variety of unusual tricks we used in working towards delega teEventStream. We made a deferred that was never resolved or rejected, we used a progress callback to deliver events from other deferreds, and, finally, we created a deferred that we never used, but which we instead pass to another function that we didn’t even write. Stay tuned to see how delegateEventStream saves the day in a later example.  Challenges 1. What  would  change  if  simpleEventStream  used  promises[i].then stream,  stream, stream  instead of chaining calls to done, fail, and progress?  2. Modify eventStream so that it keeps a count of the number of its promises that have resolved or been rejected and calls resolve on the deferred whose promise it returned when all promises have fired. This is like a final signal to the caller of eventStream to indicate that there will be no further events.  3. Prove you understand delegateEventStream by writing a function called clone Promise that takes a promise and uses delegateEventStream to return another one that acts in the same way. We can’t think of any reason why you’d want to do that, but don’t let that get in the way of stretching your mind!  56      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises There are occasions when you have multiple ways of obtaining a needed value. You don’t care which one is used, you just want the result as quickly as possible. For example, server-side code might need to retrieve a user’s avatar image. The image might be stored in a fast cache, such as Redis or memcached, it might be stored in a distributed filesystem, or you may need to fall back to making an external network request  perhaps to Grav‐ atar  to get an image after retrieving the user’s email address from either a cache or a database. The normal approach is to query the potential sources in order of expected response time. You look first in the cache. If that fails, you check the local filesystem. If that fails, you make a network request. The problem is that every time the best case doesn’t happen, the call that is finally successful doesn’t even start until after the earlier attempts have all failed. An improved approach  at least if speed is all you care about  is to launch the different attempts all at once. Then you take the first result that comes back. Managing this kind of processing seems pretty easy if you’re working with promises. Let’s start with the simplest approach:  function fastestPromise promises {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         done = function result {             deferred.resolve result ;         },         fail = function error {             deferred.reject error ;         };      for  var i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i].done done .fail fail ;     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  If you’ve been reading your way through this book, the above code will hopefully need no explanation. If you need a summary, though, the fastestPromise function adds a done and a fail callback to all the promises you pass it. The callbacks simply take the value they’re passed and use it to fire the deferred whose promise  fastestPromise originally returned. Because it doesn’t matter how many times a deferred is fired, we don’t have to worry about subsequent promises finishing and also trying to fire the promise fastestPromise returned. Only the first call to resolve or reject counts; the rest have no effect.  Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises      57   Which Promise Fired? This simplistic function can be made more useful. Our caller will likely want to know which of their promises was the first to fire. That way, if the response doesn’t come from the cache, they can cache it. Or if the result comes in while network requests are still ongoing, it may be possible to cancel them. So let’s pass the index of the promise that fires first back to the caller:  function fastestPromiseWithIndex promises {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         makeDone = function index {             return function result {                 deferred.resolve index, result ;             };         },         makeFail = function index {             return function error {                 deferred.reject index, error ;             };         };      for  var i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i].done makeDone i  .fail makeFail i  ;     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  We can use the function as follows, supposing avatarFromRedis, avatarFromFilesys tem and avatarFromGravatar have all been defined elsewhere and that each of them returns a promise:  var fastest = fastestPromiseWithIndex [     avatarFromRedis 'joe' ,     avatarFromFilesystem 'joe' ,     avatarFromGravatar 'joe@example.com'  ]  .then function index, avatar {     if  index !== 0 {            The response was not from Redis. Add the avatar info to Redis so            we have it cached.     }      if  index !== 2 {            The response was not from Gravatar. Cancel the outstanding            Gravatar network request.     }      return avatar; } ;  58      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   fastest.done function avatar {        Use the avatar. } ;  Note that the promise returned by fastestPromiseWithIndex fires with two arguments: the index of the promise arguments that fired and the result  or error . The then function examines the returned index and updates the Redis cache or cancels the network re‐ quest, as appropriate, and passes along just the avatar result.  A Fly in the Soup It seems like we’re done, but in fact the reasoning behind the above approach is massively flawed. Can you figure out what we’ve overlooked?  Hint: What do you think avatar FromRedis might do if it doesn’t find a key?  The problem has to do with timing, cache misses, and failure handling. The avatar FromRedis call is probably always going to be the first to complete. What should it do if it cannot find the key in question? Rejecting its deferred will cause fastestPromise WithIndex to in turn reject its deferred, which is not what we want at all. If avatarFrom Redis instead resolves its deferred with a value to indicate a missing key, fastestPro miseWithIndex will resolve its deferred and pass along the nonanswer. That’s no use to us either. We can’t really expect avatarFromRedis to simply be quiet if it doesn’t find a key. In any case, it should be able to reject its deferred if it runs into some other error. It might even be that the Redis service has been stopped or is unreachable for some reason. That shouldn’t prevent us from getting an answer from another source, though. We have exactly the same set of problems with avatarFromFilesystem, which might also not find the file it’s asked for, etc. What to do? We don’t want to revert to calling our functions sequentially, so we need to figure out a way to ignore cache misses, and maybe other errors, that come from avatarFromRe dis and avatarFromFilesystem  and avatarFromGravatar too, for that matter . We need more control over the promise we get back from fastestPromiseWithIndex.  delegateEventStream Redux If you managed to stay awake all the way through the last example  “Streaming Promise Events” on page 54 , you might realize that the delegateEventStream function we built is just what we need now. All we need is a handler function for the events coming from the promises returned by avatarFromRedis and friends. For simplicity, let’s assume that those functions all call resolve on the deferreds they create when they can’t find what they’re asked for and  Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises      59   that in that case they send a JavaScript object with a status attribute set to 404. Here’s the event handler we need:  function eventHandler index, type, args, deferred {     if  type === 'resolve' {         if  args[0].status === 404 {                Ignore any not-found errors.         }         else {             deferred.resolve.apply deferred, args ;         }     }     else if  type === 'reject' {         deferred.reject.apply deferred, args ;     } }  Using eventHandler we arrive at a solution that looks just like our earlier one that used fastestPromiseWithIndex, but which instead uses delegateEventStream:  var fastest = delegateEventStream [avatarFromRedis 'joe' ,                                    avatarFromFilesystem 'joe' ,                                    avatarFromGravatar 'joe@example.com' ],                                   eventHandler ;  fastest.done function avatar {        Use the avatar. } ;  Challenges 1. Add error processing to the code above that uses fastestPromiseWithIndex. 2. What will happen if fastestPromise or fastestPromiseWithIndex is called with  an empty list of promises?  3. In the code that uses fastestPromiseWithIndex, the user’s email is conveniently embedded in the JavaScript. This is of course unrealistic. Modify the code so that it looks in both Redis and a database to find the email address from the username, passing  the  result  to  avatarFromGravatar.  You  can  assume  the  existence  of promise-returning functions emailFromRedis and emailFromDatabase. Of course you should use  fastestPromiseWithIndex to initially get the email address the fastest way possible, and add it to Redis if it is not already there. For extra credit, replace the use of fastestPromiseWithIndex with delegateEventStream.  4. A nice feature about $.when is that you can safely pass it objects that are not prom‐ ises. It considers any such argument to be, essentially, a value that has already been returned by a promise. Modify fastestPromiseWithIndex to behave in the same way—i.e., if any argument is not a promise, resolve the deferred you created  whose  60      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   promise  you’re  about  to  return .  This  adds  flexibility  because  the  three  avatar- fetching functions will no longer need to return promises. You could, for example, keep an in-memory cache of the most recent user avatars and pass fastestPromi seWithIndex a function that returns a synchronous result from that cache. Hint: jQuery heuristically decides if an argument to $.when is a promise by checking to see if it has a promise attribute that’s a function.  5. How  would  you  change  eventHandler  to  ignore  failures  due  to  Redis  being  unreachable?  6. How would you change eventHandler if one of the called lookup functions rejected its deferred whenever it couldn’t find something  instead of resolving it with a 404 status ? Keep in mind that a lookup function might reject its deferred for other reasons too.  7. In the solution using delegateEventStream, we don’t populate Redis or the file‐  system in case of lookup misses. How would you fix that?  8. There is a small but important bug in our final solution. What is it and how can  you fix it?  A Deferred Queue The Python event-driven networking engine Twisted is entirely based on deferreds. Twisted deferreds are conceptually identical to those in jQuery, but the details of their behavior differs in several important ways. An extraordinarily elegant small class in Twisted is DeferredQueue. Before we examine it, though, think about code for a regular synchronous queue. What happens if you call get on a regular queue that’s empty? Almost certainly one of two things: you’ll get some kind of QueueEmpty error, or else your code will block until some other code puts something into the queue. That is, you either get a synchronous error or you get a synchronous nonempty response. Below is a simplified version of the Twisted class, written for use in node.js. The make Queue function returns an object that has queue get and put methods on it.  function makeQueue  {     var $ = require 'jquery-deferred' ,         waiting = [],             queue = [];          return {         get: function  {             var deferred;             if  queue.length {                 deferred = $.Deferred  .resolve queue.shift   ;      A Deferred Queue      61               }             else {                 deferred = $.Deferred  ;                 waiting.push deferred ;                 }             return deferred.promise  ;         },          put: function item {             if  waiting.length {                 waiting.shift  .resolve item ;                 }             else {                 queue.push item ;                 }         }     }; }  waiting is a list of unresolved deferreds whose promises were returned to callers of get when there were no items in the queue. As items are put into the queue, these deferreds will be resolved. queue is a list of items that have been put, but which have not yet been retrieved with a get. When a call is made to get and there are items in the queue, a new deferred is made, the first item in the queue is used to resolve it immediately, and its promise is returned to the caller. Any callbacks the caller adds to the returned promise will run at once because the deferred has already been resolved. If there is nothing in the queue in get, a new deferred is made, it is added to waiting  so we can later resolve it when an item arrives via put , and its promise is returned. When put is called, if an earlier caller to get received an unresolved promise  i.e., the queue was empty in get so it returned a promise whose deferred is still in waiting , resolve its deferred with the incoming item. If there are no earlier callers who have not yet received a result, push the new item onto the queue so it can be given to a future caller of get.  The Twisted DeferredQueue class is a thing of beauty. It’s a valuable example. This kind of coding with deferreds seems routine and straightforward to us now. But it certainly wasn’t always that way. If you don’t 100% understand the above, we highly recommend that you stop and take the time to read it again and to think about it. Once you really “get” it, you’ll be well on your way to mastering deferreds.  62      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Challenges 1. Implement a deferred priority queue. The put function should accept an optional numeric priority argument and get should return a promise that fires with the highest priority element.  2. Enhance the priority queue with functions that allow an element to be deleted from  the queue or to be re-prioritized.  when2: An Improved jQuery.when In “Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises” on page 57, we focused on requesting the same information  a user’s avatar  from various possible sources and acting on the first response. While our solution is useful, the implementation was a bit simplistic and not as general as it could have been. An obvious first generalization is that we may want to make several calls that are not designed to return the same information. For example, we might make a web socket API request to a remote server and want to set a timeout on the reply. If we have a deferred for both the web socket request and the timeout, it would be useful to have a way to get a third deferred that resolves when the first of the other two is resolved. These situations have a lot in common with what $.when provides. $.when returns a promise that resolves when all its arguments are resolved. In “Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises” on page 57, we wanted a promise that resolves as soon as any of its promises is resolved. There’s another aspect of $.when that can be limiting: as soon as any of its promises is rejected, it rejects the deferred whose promise it returned. So it doesn’t provide a mech‐ anism for monitoring a collection of promises and getting results from all of them— including any errors. We’ve actually already run into this limitation, in the web socket “Challenges” on page 46. In summary, there are three common actions that might be wanted on a set of promises:  1. Resolve on the first success. 2. Reject on the first error  the $.when behavior . 3. Resolve when all results  successes or errors  have been collected.  These behaviors don’t seem that different. Given their similarity to $.when, it shouldn’t be that hard to modify $.when to make it more flexible.  when2: An Improved jQuery.when      63   We wrote when2 to do exactly that. You can load it after loading jQuery  hence its use of jQuery instead of $ . Our when2 function is based on the $.when jQuery deferred.js source. The source for when2, and a test suite, can also be found on GitHub. The when2 function takes two arguments: promises, which is a list of promises  that may  include  nonpromise  values   and  options,  an  optional  JavaScript  object.  The options object lets us choose among the three behaviors just described:  1. If options.resolveOnFirstSuccess is true, the promise returned by when2 will resolve as soon as any of the passed deferreds resolves. The always and done call‐ backs will be passed index and value arguments, where index is the index of the deferred that fired. If nonpromises are in the arguments to when2, the first one seen will trigger the resolve callbacks  not very useful, but consistent .  2. If options.rejectOnFirstError is false, the promise returned by when2 will never be rejected. It will collect the results  successes and failures  from all the passed promises and deliver them all at once via resolve. The when2 caller gets to figure out which values, if any, are errors.  3. If no  options argument is passed or  options.rejectOnFirstError is true, the promise returned by when2 will be rejected on the first error. This is the behavior of $.when. The arguments passed to always and fail callbacks will be an index and a value.  jQuery.when2 = function promises, options {         var i,         coreSlice = [].slice,         resolveValues = promises ? coreSlice.call promises  : [],             length = resolveValues.length,         resolveContexts = length ? new Array length  : window,         remaining = length,             promiseArgFound = false,             resolveOnFirstSuccess =  options &&                                  options.resolveOnFirstSuccess ,             rejectOnFirstError = !options  options.rejectOnFirstError,              deferred = jQuery.Deferred  ,              doneFunc = function i {                 return function value {                 if  deferred.state   === 'pending' {                     --remaining;                         resolveContexts[i] = this;                     resolveValues[i] = arguments.length > 1 ?                         coreSlice.call arguments  : value;                     if  resolveOnFirstSuccess {                         deferred.resolveWith                              this, [i, resolveValues[i]] ;      64      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes                       }                     else if  remaining === 0 {                             deferred.resolveWith resolveContexts, resolveValues ;                     }                 }             };         },          failFunc = function i {                 if  rejectOnFirstError {                 return function value {                     if  deferred.state   === 'pending' {                         value = arguments.length > 1 ?                             coreSlice.call arguments  : value;                         deferred.rejectWith this, [i, value] ;                         }                 };             }             else {                 return function value {                     if  deferred.state   === 'pending' {                         resolveContexts[i] = this;                         resolveValues[i] = arguments.length > 1 ?                             coreSlice.call arguments  : value;                             if  !--remaining {                                 deferred.resolveWith                                  resolveContexts, resolveValues ;                         }                     }                 };             }         },          progressFunc = function i {                 return function value {                 if  deferred.state   === 'pending' {                     value = arguments.length > 1 ?                         coreSlice.call arguments  : value;                     deferred.notifyWith this, [i, value] ;                 }             };         };      for  i = 0; i < length; i++ {             if  resolveValues[i] &&                 jQuery.isFunction resolveValues[i].promise  {             promiseArgFound = true;             resolveValues[i].promise                   .done doneFunc i                   .fail failFunc i                   .progress progressFunc i  ;         }  when2: An Improved jQuery.when      65           else {             if  resolveOnFirstSuccess {                     deferred.resolveWith window, [i, resolveValues[i]] ;             }             resolveContexts[i] = window;             --remaining;             }     }      if  promiseArgFound === false {         deferred.resolveWith resolveContexts, resolveValues ;         }      return deferred.promise  ; };  There’s quite a bit of detail  inherited from $.when  in the above that we won’t try to explain, seeing as the main point here is to understand deferreds rather than all the idiosyncracies  of  JavaScript.  Even  ignoring  those  details,  there’s  a  lot  going  on  in when2. Take a deep breath. Here’s how it works:  Accept two arguments: a list of promises  this may include nonpromise values  and an optional JavaScript object to indicate when the returned promise should be resolved or rejected, as described above. resolveValues will collect the results  and errors, if  rejectOnFirstError is false  returned by the passed promises. remaining will be used to count the number of outstanding promises yet to fire. When it reaches zero, the promise returned by when2 will be resolved  assuming it has not already been resolved or rejected due to the passed value of resol veOnFirstSuccess or rejectOnFirstError . promiseArgFound tracks whether any of the arguments passed to  when2 have promise methods. If no promises are passed to when2, the promise it returns will already have been fired  since there is nothing to wait for . resolveOnFirstSuccess, if true, will cause the returned promise to resolve as soon as any of the passed arguments is resolved. Note that any passed argument that does not have a promise method will be counted as already being “resolved,” and will trigger a resolve call on the deferred whose promise is returned. rejectOnFirstError, if true  or if no options object is passed , will cause the returned  promise  to  be  rejected  as  soon  as  any  of  the  passed  arguments  is rejected. This is the behavior of $.when. Create the master deferred, whose promise will be returned.  66      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   doneFunc returns a callback function that can be added to the done list of a passed promise. One of the passed promises has resolved, so decrement the count of remaining outstanding promises. If  resolveOnFirstSuccess  was  true,  we  immediately  resolve  the  master deferred. Instead of just passing the result along with no indication of which promise fired, pass the index of the promise as well. Otherwise, if the count of remaining promises to fire is now zero, resolve the master deferred. failFunc is similar to doneFunc, but it handles the case where a passed promise is rejected. If rejectOnFirstError is true, we reject the master deferred. Again, we pass the index of the promise that was rejected along with the error. If rejectOnFirstError is not true, the error value is stored in the resolveVal ues array  whose name is therefore a slight misnomer . If there are no outstanding promises remaining, resolve the master deferred with the accumulated results. progressFunc mirrors doneFunc and failFunc, though it is simpler. Note that progress callbacks will also be called with an index and a value. Loop over the passed arguments. If an argument has a promise method, we assume it’s something we can add done,  fail,  and  progress  callbacks  to,  and  do  so.  We  also  set  promiseArg Found  to  true  so  we’ll  know  that  the  returned  promise  should  not  be  fired immediately. If an argument is not a promise and resolveOnFirstSuccess is true, resolve the master deferred. This is probably not very useful, but it’s consistent with the treatment of these values as, essentially, already resolved promises by $.when. The  count  of  outstanding  promises  is  decremented  if  an  argument  is  not  a promise. Finally, if no promise argument was found, resolve the master deferred with all the passed arguments.  Using when2 to Time Out a Single Promise We can use the resolveOnFirstSuccess option to when2 in a nice way that lets us time out a promise.  when2: An Improved jQuery.when      67   The trick is to call when2 with the promise you want to time out and a promise returned from the wait function we wrote earlier  in “A Replacement for the setTimeout Func‐ tion” on page 21 , and set the resolveOnFirstSuccess option to true. when2 returns a new promise that will fire either because the wait promise has resolved or because your original promise did. To be more concrete, suppose you have a variable called promise returned by some other function and you want to allow it 200 milliseconds to fire before taking some other action. You’d write:  $.when2      [wait 200 , promise],     { resolveOnFirstSuccess: true }  .done function index, result {     if  index === 0 {            Timeout!     }     else {            The promise was resolved with the given result.     } } ;  This small example again illustrates the building-block beauty of deferreds. If you don’t have quite what you need, make a new deferred and hook your old one up to it to give you the behavior you need.  Differences from $.when Here’s a summary of the key differences from the $.when function:    You must pass a list of promises to when2 instead of just passing all your promises  as individual arguments.    You  can  optionally  also  pass  a  JavaScript  object  with  resolveOnFirstSuccess and or rejectOnFirstError attributes. The default behavior is to fail on the first error, just like $.when.    When either  or both  of resolveOnFirstSuccess or rejectOnFirstError is in effect, all callbacks are called with two arguments: an index into the passed list of promises  so you can figure out which promise fired  and the result.    progress callbacks added to a promise returned by when2 will always be called with  an index and a result, as above.    If rejectOnFirstError is false, the when2 master deferred will never be rejected. It will be resolved with the result of all promises, each with a success or error value  you get to figure out which is which .  68      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Challenges 1. How would the behavior of when2 change if the line with the resolveWith call at  the end of the function was commented out?  2. What would change if the if  deferred.state   === 'pending'  guard tests  were all removed?  3. An alternative behavior when a nonpromise argument is passed and resolveOn FirstSuccess is true is to just store the argument in resolveValues and not resolve the master deferred until an actual promise argument  if any  is resolved. How would  you  make  this  simple  change?  What  should  happen  in  the  case  that  no promises are passed to when2?  4. We saw a neat way to time out a single promise using when2. Unfortunately, that  trick won’t work if we try to time out more than one promise. Why not?  5. Imagine that a caller of when2 wasn’t interested in receiving progress updates from the passed promises but instead wanted to know when each passed promise was resolved. For example, you might send write commands to three mirrored servers and you want to know when any two of them have completed the write. Modify when2 so that each time one of the passed promises is resolved, the index and the result is passed to the progress callbacks. Note that the promise returned by when2 will still be resolved or rejected exactly as above; you’re just repurposing the pro gress events. You can add to the options argument to let the caller request this behavior. See also “Streaming Promise Events” on page 54.  Timing Out Promises In “when2: An Improved jQuery.when” on page 63, we met when2 and saw how it could be used to time out a single promise. One of the challenges given in that example was figuring out why that approach will not work if you need to time out multiple simulta‐ neous deferreds. The problem is that setting resolveOnFirstSuccess to true in calling when2 will pre‐ vent us from being notified properly when all the promises have been resolved. The timeout part works fine. The problem is that any single promise that completes before the timeout will trigger the resolve of the master deferred from when2. There’s no way to get all the results! A sneaky first thought for fixing this might be to instead use a modified wait function that rejects its deferred if the timeout happens:  Timing Out Promises      69   function waitThenReject timeout {     var d = $.Deferred  ;     setTimeout d.reject, timeout ;     return d.promise  ; }  Then we could use it as follows, assuming we already had two promises returned from other functions:   * THE FOLLOWING DOESN'T WORK! *   $.when2 [waitThenReject 200 , promise1, promise2]  .done function timeoutResult, result1, result2 {        Both promises are resolved. }  .fail function index, error {     if  index === 0 {            Timeout!     }     else {            The promise given by index was rejected with the given error.     } } ;  But, cute as it is, this approach has a fatal flaw. Can you spot it? The problem is that the promise returned by waitThenReject is never resolved—it can only be rejected. The  done callback above will never be called. In fact, the promise returned by  when2 will always be rejected, even if  promise1 and  promise2 are both resolved before the timeout. If they both resolve early, the deferred created by when2 doesn’t get resolved as it is waiting for three deferreds to resolve. One solution to this would be to add an integer resolveAfter to the options passed to when2 that would cause it to resolve the master deferred once that many underlying promises were resolved. Part of that is easy  the resolving , but part of it would be slightly messy—what values would we resolve the master deferred with for those promises that had not yet resolved? Instead, let’s do something more challenging to help you learn more about working with deferreds. First, here’s a timeout function that returns a promise and a trigger function:  function deactivatingWait timeout, triggerCount {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         count = 0,         timeoutId = setTimeout deferred.reject, timeout ,         trigger = function  {             if  ++count === triggerCount {                 clearTimeout timeoutId ;                 deferred.resolve  ;             }         };  70      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes       return [deferred.promise  , trigger]; }  As with our waitThenReject function, the returned promise will be rejected after the timeout has elapsed. However, this will only happen if the trigger function has not already been called at least triggerCount times. If the trigger is called triggerCount times, the returned promise is resolved. As a result, we obtain a promise that will be rejected after a timeout, but which can also be made to resolve under the right conditions. All we need to do is call deactivating Wait, arrange for our preexisting promises to call the trigger function when they’re resolved, and then pass the promise from deactivatingWait to when2 along with our original promises:  var result = deactivatingWait 200, 2 ,     timeoutPromise = result[0],     trigger = result[1];  promise1.done trigger ; promise2.done trigger ;  $.when2 [timeoutPromise, promise1, promise2]  .done function timeoutResult, result1, result2 {        Both promises resolved before the time out. }  .fail function index, error {     if  index === 0 {            Timeout!     }     else {            The promise given by index was rejected with the given error.     } } ;  The above is slightly clunky, but we’re almost there. Now that we know what to do, it’s not hard to create a utility function to hide the setup work and to massage the when2 callback results:  function when2WithTimeout timeout, promises, options {      var result = deactivatingWait timeout, promises.length ,         timeoutPromise = result[0],         trigger = result[1],         i;      for  i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i].done trigger ;     }  Timing Out Promises      71       return $.when2 [timeoutPromise].concat promises , options .then          function  {                Drop the 'undefined' result of the deactivatingWait promise.             return Array.prototype.slice.call arguments, 1 ;         },         function index, error {                Adjust the index to match promises.             return [index - 1, error];         },         function index, value {                Adjust the index to match promises.             return [index - 1, value];         }      ; }  This function is used as follows:  when2WithTimeout 200, [promise1, promise2]  .done function results {        Both promises are resolved. Results are in results[0] and results[1]. }  .fail function result {     var index = result[0],         error = result[1];     if  index === -1 {            Timeout!     }     else {            The promise given by index was rejected with the given error.     } } ;  The timeout is detected in the fail callback when the index is -1.  Challenges 1. What would happen if we removed the clearTimeout call in the deactivating  Wait function above?  2. A minor wrinkle in when2WithTimeout is that it should check options to make sure rejectOnFirstError is true  or missing, since that’s the default . What would hap‐ pen if rejectOnFirstError were not true?  72      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Controlling Your Own Destiny Through this book we’ve drilled the create deferreds, return promises message into you. That’s a safety-first convention that makes good sense: code that receives a promise has no way of accidentally firing it. But what if you want to deliberately fire a promise you receive? While this might sound like it goes completely against the intention of deferreds, in practice there are legitimate reasons you might want to fire a promise you received from someone else. For example, you might be building a system that needs to time out the requests it is making, causing them to immediately resolve with a specific default value. Or you might want an outstanding deferred to be rejected at a specific moment  e.g., system shutdown  with a specific given value. Or maybe you’ve received a promise for a long-running task that doesn’t send any progress information and you want to provide progress informa‐ tion  e.g., elapsed time  yourself by calling notify. You can’t do any of these things if all you have is a promise. The code that returned you the promise has total control. If there’s a bug in that code that causes it not to fire, or something else goes wrong, you’re out of luck and your whole program may hang as a result. So there are plenty of reasons why you might want to somehow resolve, reject, or notify a promise you were given. Not letting you do so just so you don’t accidentally shoot yourself in the foot is a pretty thin reason to take away control. Wouldn’t it be more mature and trusting if code that returned a read-only promise instead returned a de‐ ferred? The deferred receiver could convert it into a read-only promise if it knew it would never need to fire the deferred and wanted to disable the resolve, reject, etc., methods for safety? Given that we’re unlikely to change the world and that there is already a ton of code out there that returns promises, what can we do? How can we wrest back control and escape the read-only world where we’re treated like children who need to be protected from themselves? Take a moment to think about it. It turns out there’s an easy fix that again illustrates the elegance of deferreds. You can write a function like the following:  function deferredFromPromise promise {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;      promise         .done deferred.resolve          .fail deferred.reject          .progress deferred.notify ;      return deferred; }  Controlling Your Own Destiny      73   How cool is that? The deferredFromPromise function takes a promise and returns a new deferred. All it does is hook up the output  done, fail, progress  of the original promise so that it will trigger the corresponding method  resolve, reject, notify  on the deferred. Because there’s no problem if a jQuery deferred has resolve or reject called on it multiple times  the later calls have no effect , only the first code to fire the deferred returned by deferredFromPromise will determine its fate. That could be the code that made the deferred from which the original promise was obtained  the normal situation , but it could equally be your code that receives the deferred from deferredFromPromise. This is another example of why deferreds are so elegant. We had what looked like a fundamental limitation but found an easy way around it by making another deferred and wiring things up the way we wanted them. Other examples of this technique are the promise then method, $.when  if you pass it more than one argument , when2  see “when2: An Improved jQuery.when” on page 63 , and our example in “Timing Out Promises” on page 69. Deferreds make great building blocks!  Challenges 1. Rewrite deferredFromPromise to be a function that executes just one statement. 2. If you were writing an API that returned promises and you wanted to give your caller the ability to fire them, you could simply wrap your returned promise in a call to deferredFromPromise. What could you do that would be even easier?  3. What will happen if promise has already been resolved or rejected when it is passed  to deferredFromPromise?  Deactivating a Promise To complement “Controlling Your Own Destiny” on page 73, there’s another way in which you might want to give yourself more control over a promise. What happens if for some reason you decide you’re no longer interested in the result of a promise and you don’t want to receive a value from it at all? For example, you might be shutting down a system and need to ignore some outstanding promises that you would normally want to react to. A subsystem that could handle a resolved promise result might have been shut down or a data structure holding results might no longer exist. Whatever the case, you want to deactivate an existing promise, so that it never calls the callbacks you attached to it earlier.  74      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   Once again we can solve the problem using a second deferred. Here’s a deactivatable Promise function that takes one promise and returns another that has a deactivate method on it:  function deactivatablePromise promise {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         newPromise = deferred.promise  ,         deactivated = false,             unlessDeactivated = function func {                 return function value {                 if  deactivated === false {                     return func value ;                 }             };         };      promise             .done unlessDeactivated deferred.resolve           .fail unlessDeactivated deferred.reject           .progress unlessDeactivated deferred.notify  ;      newPromise.deactivate = function  {             deactivated = true;         return newPromise;     };      return newPromise;     }  Suppose you call a function that returns a promise and you want to be able to deactivate the promise if it becomes necessary. Instead of adding callbacks to the promise, first pass it to deactivatablePromise to obtain a promise that you can deactivate. Then add your callbacks to that new promise. If you later call the deactivate method on it, the new promise will not call any of its callbacks when it fires  unless it had already fired, of course . Here’s how it works:  We use a deactivated variable that keeps track of whether deactivate has been called and that we’ll use to conditionally trigger the new promise. The unlessDeactivated function takes a function argument  func  and returns a function that will call func with an argument, but only if deactivate has not been called. Arrange  for  the  existing  promise  to  conditionally  call  the  new  deferred’s  re solve,  reject, and  notify functions if it fires. If the new promise has been deactivated  see next point , though, the event will not be passed on to the new promise.  Deactivating a Promise      75   We add a deactivate method to the new promise that just sets the deactiva ted variable to be true. Return the new promise.  Challenges 1. Why does the newPromise.deactivate function return the new promise? 2. unlessDeactivated returns a function that takes one parameter  value . Change it to be compatible with jQuery deferreds: it should accept any number of param‐ eters and pass these on in the call to func.  3. It’s not 100% safe to add our own deactivate method to the promise returned by deactivatablePromise. If a future version of jQuery adds an identically named function to promises, we’ll clobber it. How might you change deactivatablePro mise to eliminate this risk?  4. Write a function that takes a promise and returns an object with resolve, resolve With, reject, rejectWith, notify, and notifyWith methods  as in “Controlling Your Own Destiny” on page 73  as well as a deactivate method, as in this example. That combination gives you total freedom: you can  essentially  fire the promise yourself or you can choose to deactivate it.  76      Chapter 3: Deferred Recipes   CHAPTER 4 More Time in the Mental Gymnasium  The recipes in the previous chapter are useful in a practical sense, yet we also wrote them to help you exercise the mental muscles needed for thinking about deferreds. Although conceptually simple, deferreds and promises can be mind-bending and yet a pleasure to ponder. It may take some time to digest everything, but deferreds are worth exploring further  both more deeply and broadly , and that’s the purpose of this chapter. Do You Really Understand jQuery Deferreds? To warm up, let’s see if you really understand jQuery deferreds. If you do, you should be able to answer the following questions with little hesitation:    Explain the differences between done, then, and $.when.   Given a promise variable, what’s the difference between these two code fragments?  promise.then doneFunc, errorFunc   promise.done doneFunc .fail errorFunc     What happens if you return a value from a done callback? What should you probably  be doing instead?    What happens if you call then on a promise, but don’t provide any arguments?   Take another look at this code fragment from “Familiar Promises” on page 4:  $.when      $.ajax 'http:  google.com' .then function  {         return $ 'label_1' .animate { opacity: 0.25 }, 100 ;     } ,     $.ajax 'http:  yahoo.com' .then function  {         return $ 'label_2' .animate { opacity: 0.75 }, 200 ;     }   77    .then      function  {            Both URLs have been fetched and both animations have completed.     }  ;  In order of difficulty: — .promise   is not called on the result of the calls to animate. Why is that not  needed?  — What would be the effect of removing the two return keywords  i.e., call ani  mate as above, just don’t return its result ?  — How can you arrange to get the results of the $.ajax calls passed as arguments  to the final function?  If you’re unsure of the answers to these questions, rereading Chapter 2 will probably help, as will writing small pieces of code to have a closer look. Make sure you understand all the points listed in “Deferred Dynamics” on page 18. Promises A+ Feeling warmed up? Let’s stretch our mental muscles a bit further by learning about a standard for promises. We have mentioned the Promises A+ proposal at several points in the book. It’s a library- agnostic clarification of the expected behavior of promises. There is also the original Promises A  upon which jQuery promises is based  and a newer Promises B propos‐ al. Promises A+ is the most popular current proposal. A+ is a clarification, extension, and simplification of the original Promises A. It is important that you know about Promises A+, because most of the popular promise libraries conform to the A+ proposal. Its main  although not exclusive  focus is the means of interacting with promises via the then method. It’s a short, well-written docu‐ ment released in the public domain. It takes only minutes to read. We’ve included a copy in Appendix B. To summarize, Promises A+ states that the then method should return a new promise. In so doing, it facilitates the chaining of callbacks via further calls via then on subse‐ quently returned promises. It makes explicit the expected behavior of both the onFul filled and onRejected handlers and how a promise may transition between pending, fulfilled, and rejected states. Rather than repeat an already well-written and compact document, we feel it necessary to explain the most important and subtle way it differs from the apparently similar jQuery deferred API.  78      Chapter 4: More Time in the Mental Gymnasium   It boils down to error handling. In the Promises A+ world, an exception raised in a callback passed to then is handled automatically. The call to then will return a promise in a rejected state, with the exception set as the reason attribute of the new promise. However, jQuery promises don’t do this. Their then doesn’t return a rejected promise. Instead, exceptions are not caught. An exception in a function passed to then will break any neatly composed chain of then handlers. An exception in an always, done, or fail callback will terminate that callback but also prevent the invocation of the rest of the callbacks added to the promise. In all these cases, the exception will propagate up the call stack. If you’re running a node.js server, an uncaught exception will cause your server to exit, which is clearly a serious problem. Therefore, when using jQuery deferreds you’ll need to be more careful about catching regular exceptions in your callback functions and finding ways to fail when the original call stack context  in which you arranged for the callbacks to be invoked  has long gone. Promises A+ lets failures flow back via rejected promises. This  difference  and  its  impact  is  elegantly  discussed  in  Dominic  Denicola’s  article “You’re Missing the Point of Promises”, in which he introduces a test suite for Promises  A+ compliance. The slides of Dominic’s “Promises, Promises” presentation are also worth reading, particularly the description of the correspondence between asynchro‐ nous Promises A+ code and regular synchronous code. There are a number of other differences between jQuery deferreds and Promises A+. For example, the jQuery version of then allows you to pass a progress function, but Promises A+ does not require this  though Promises A did . The Promises A+ speci‐ fication makes no mention of methods such as done, fail, etc., relying only on then. You will discover other differences—including runtime ones such as speed and memory usage—if you compare the implementations yourself or spend some time online reading comparison tests and benchmarks. There are many packages for JavaScript  and some in other languages too  that conform to the Promises A+ standard. The Promises A+ website contains an up-to-date list. Promises Are First-Class Objects for Function Calls In JavaScript, we describe functions as first-class objects. It’s why we’re able to do all sorts of interesting, empowering, and downright fun things with functions: return a function from a function, pass a function as an argument into yet another function, and create anonymous functions on the fly. It’s hard to imagine JavaScript without such a powerful core feature.  Promises Are First-Class Objects for Function Calls      79   With that in mind, try this exercise in a change of perspective: deferreds and promises are first-class objects for function calls. If you think about it, they give us a way to take a function call  or the handling of an event  and pass it around: we can return a promise from a function, pass a promise as an argument into a function, store it in a data structure, and, obviously, arrange how to process the result  or error  of the function call independently of the function call itself. To be a bit more abstract: a promise is a time-independent reification of a function call. A promise is time-independent because, as we saw in “Memoization” on page 49, you don’t have to worry whether the underlying function call has already completed, is currently in progress, or has yet to run. There may even be no way to find out. The point is that you don’t have to care and you shouldn’t care. Like many others, we described deferreds and promises in Chapter 1 as representing a result that may not be available yet. Describing promises as a reification of a function call takes the time factor completely out of the picture. If you’ve managed to switch your perspective, this way of looking at deferreds is a lot simpler to explain and understand. Asynchronous Data Structures Although deferreds are useful for handling familiar tasks such as network calls, user interface events, and talking to databases and other storage, nothing about deferreds is specific to those things. Because deferreds are not tied to any particular usage, you can use  them  to  build  asynchronous  implementations  of  other  things  that  might  seem surprising. For example, consider asynchronous data structures. “A Deferred Queue” on page 61 gives a good example of this line of thinking. Let’s revisit the deferred queue code, slightly simplified:  var waiting = [], queue = [];  function get  {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;     if  queue.length {         deferred.resolve queue.shift   ;     }     else {         waiting.push deferred ;     }     return deferred.promise  ; }  function put item {     if  waiting.length {         waiting.shift  .resolve item ;     }  80      Chapter 4: More Time in the Mental Gymnasium       else {         queue.push item ;     } }  As we suggested in that example, think about code for a regular synchronous queue. What happens if you call get on a regular queue that’s empty? Almost certainly one of two things: you’ll get some kind of QueueEmpty error, or else your code will block until some other code puts something into the queue. That is, you either get a synchronous error or you get a synchronous nonempty response. In contrast, look at the get function above. A new deferred is always made. If the queue is nonempty, the deferred is resolved and its promise is returned. If the queue is empty, the deferred is added to waiting and its promise is returned. Code calling get on an empty queue doesn’t get an error and it doesn’t block; it always receives a result imme‐ diately. How can you get a result from an empty queue? Easy! The result is a promise. In either case, the caller just attaches callbacks to the returned promise, and goes on its merry way. It doesn’t need to know if the promise has already fired or when it will fire. It just needs to know how to process a queue item. In effect, we’ve built an asynchronous data structure. We find that concept very attrac‐ tive, and thinking in those terms helped us to see part of the reason why deferreds are so great. Deferreds are not specifically asynchronous or synchronous: they’re so simple they don’t even care, and as a consumer of promises, your code doesn’t have to either. That’s all remarkably elegant. Bonus challenge: imagine you have a producer and a consumer wanting to exchange a dictionary data structure. The producer will produce values in a random key order, while the consumer requests keys in some other random order. Implement an asyn‐ chronous dictionary using deferreds in the style of the deferred queue above. Advantages of Deferreds It is typical to first gain an appreciation of deferreds  in general, not just the jQuery flavor  by using them in the context of a specific problem. But deferreds are useful and powerful in multiple ways. Your understanding will be stronger if you consider them all at once. Here’s a summary. Deferreds provide a formal first-class place to hold a future result. You can pass a de‐ ferred to other pieces of code. This allows multiple independent pieces of code to act on its result. The first-class object gives your program a data structure that captures the fact that a function has been called. That data structure can be used from the moment the function has been called until it has returned. As we saw in “Memoization” on page 49, this can be very useful. Because the deferred is time-independent, you also don’t  Advantages of Deferreds      81   need to worry about events firing before you’ve added handlers for them—you can add event handlers  callbacks  after the fact. Without deferreds, you get to attach just one callback handler to events. If other code needs to also handle the result of the event, calls to those other functions need to be placed in the original callback. This leads to a mess: callback handlers that do not serve a single purpose and that are harder to understand and test. Deferreds make great building blocks. We’ve repeatedly seen how simple it is to solve problems by creating an additional deferred and hooking up things just as we need them. It is a testament to the elegance and power of deferreds that this can be done so cleanly and easily. Each time you do it, you just end up with another deferred, which allows for additional processing layers to be added in an identical way, if needed. Deferreds make it simple r  to work with multiple asynchronous calls. In “Food for Thought” on page 1 and “when” on page 13, we looked at how awkward it can be to work with more than one asynchronous function call. The examples we considered were trivial. When building non-toy systems, things get much more complicated. Deferreds can’t make a complicated situation less complex, but they will allow you to write code to handle it in a cleaner way. Code that doesn’t use deferreds does not have an object to pass around that represents the handling of an event  or the future result of a function call . This forces us to set up complex event handling using the lexical structure of our code—callbacks in callbacks in callbacks, etc. The logical structure of one’s code can become extremely awkward, as can error handling. Complex programs using deferreds can also be very difficult to understand and arguably harder to follow logically, but there is more scope for cleaner separation of code and nicer error handling  at least with Promises A+ . Deferreds are very useful for setting up processing of request responses in a free-form messaging environment  where both sides can send messages at any time . We saw examples of this in “Communicating with a Web Worker” on page 37 and “Using Web Sockets” on page 42. An important advantage of this approach is that code that makes an asynchronous call can arrange to process the response without losing context. When you make the call, your code has access to its current scope, local variables, relevant UI components, etc. In free-form messaging, when the reply arrives, you often need to reconstruct the necessary parts of the original context in order to process the result. With deferreds, you can set this up on the spot by adding handlers to the deferred, which is extremely convenient in practice. Difficulties with Deferreds There are a few ways in which deferreds can be problematic. Occasionally you will build a complex structure of dependent deferreds and one of them will fail to fire. For example, a network request is somehow lost or never returns. This  82      Chapter 4: More Time in the Mental Gymnasium   jams up the whole system: a deferred never fires and all downstream deferreds fail to resolve. This kind of problem has to be dealt with by programmers in any case; it’s not specific to deferreds, but there can be a feeling of a certain brittle dependency. We’ve explored several ways in which these problems can be addressed: timing out promises  in “when2: An Improved jQuery.when” on page 63 and “Timing Out Promises” on page 69 , firing promises ourselves  in “Controlling Your Own Destiny” on page 73 , and deactivating promises entirely  in “Deactivating a Promise” on page 74 . A second issue, which is more serious and which may preclude the use of deferreds at all, is that deferreds keep the result of their computation around. If it happens that you only need a result once, introducing deferreds will add to memory load and may make garbage collection more difficult for the system. Deferreds are often viewed as resulting in code that is difficult to read and understand. This is subjective, of course. It is also the case that some programming situations are inherently complicated, and that complexity cannot really be mitigated. Nevertheless, making sense of deferred code can sometimes be more difficult than it is with more traditional JavaScript callback nesting. This is especially the case with very simple event handling. Once asynchronous code logic gets more than a couple of levels deep, we’ve found deferred code to be cleaner due to its separation and having first-class objects to pass around and store in data structures. There’s more to deferreds, though, than po‐ tential gains  or losses  in code organization and readability, as just discussed above. In our experience, any loss in code readability is more than made up for by gains in other ways. There is sometimes the feeling of a lock-in effect when using deferreds. Once you start calling and writing functions that use deferreds, you’ll invariably end up doing more of it. That’s also the case with nested callback handling; it’s just a different style of getting things done. Fortunately, JavaScript is inherently event-based, so it is usually trivial to write deferred-based wrappers for functions you want to call that do not follow this style. It is also usually very easy to mix deferred-using code with regular code. Finally, if you’re building a team, use of deferreds may have a human resources impact: you’ll likely end up looking for programmers who are already familiar with deferreds. Programmers who are unfamiliar with deferreds are definitely still in the majority. We hope to help change that! Further Reading James Coglan has written three excellent articles on promises: “Promises are the monad of asynchronous programming”, “Callbacks are imperative, promises are functional: Node’s biggest missed opportunity”, and “Callbacks, promises, and simplicity”. The articles may not be easy to understand on a first reading. You might find it easiest to start with the second. They are well worth rereading and thinking about until you do  Further Reading      83   get it. Don’t give up—it’s important! For balance, you should also read Drew Craw‐ ford’s response, “Broken Promises”, which describes issues he ran into using promises in the highly memory-constrained iOS environment, and, more generally, why trying to  use  promises  to  solve  every  asynchronous  flow  of  control  problem  can  lead  to difficulties. Many people have written about jQuery deferreds online, and some of the articles are excellent. There was a flurry of writing when deferreds were introduced to jQuery in version 1.5 on January 31, 2011. As mentioned in “Changes in the jQuery Deferred API” on page 19, subsequent changes in the deferred API mean you need to be a little careful when reading. For example, most recent online articles still discuss the pipe function, which was deprecated in version 1.8  August 9, 2012 . But don’t worry too much: even if articles are slightly out of date with respect to the API, you can still learn a lot from them and may benefit from other people’s perspectives and explanations. Here’s a small selection, focused mainly on jQuery deferreds, that you may find useful:    “Creating Responsive Applications Using jQuery Deferred and Promises”   “Redemption from Callback Hell”   “jQuery.Deferred is the most important client-side tool you have”   “Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5”   “Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript with ‘Promises’”  You might also be interested to read how Twitter transitioned their architecture to use “services” that return futures  i.e., deferreds  via RPC using Finagle. Deferreds have been around since 1976, under many names and guises, and in many programming languages. For some history, see the Wikipedia article on “Futures and promises”.  84      Chapter 4: More Time in the Mental Gymnasium   APPENDIX A Hints for Selected Challenges  Here you’ll find solutions or hints for almost all the challenges in the book. Where an answer requires a significant amount of code, we make some suggestions but have left the coding to you. A Replacement for the setTimeout Function 1. This is pretty easy:  function wait timeout {     return $.Deferred function deferred {         setTimeout deferred.resolve, timeout ;     } .promise  ; }  2. You’d write something like this:  var promise = wait 500 ;  promise.done function  {     console.log 'Timeout fired!' ; } ;  one promise ; two promise ;  Of course the one and two functions have to be able to accept a promise. We described this challenge as “subtly different” because it’s meant to demonstrate that our replacement setTimeout function is more than just a syntactic nicety. It gives you something you didn’t have before: a value that you can pass around to others. Although this is a trivial example, the principle is important.  3. We just need to store the timeout identifier and add a function to the returning  promise to clear the timeout and reject the deferred:  85   function wait timeout {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         promise = deferred.promise  ,         timeoutId = setTimeout deferred.resolve, timeout ;      promise.cancel = function  {         clearTimeout timeoutId ;         deferred.reject.apply deferred, arguments ;     };      return promise; }  Note that this isn’t the best coding style. We probably shouldn’t be adding attributes to the promise in this way. How would you fix this shortcoming? While you’re at it, add a cancelWith function to call rejectWith on the deferred.  Messaging in Chrome Extensions 1. That depends. The message to the content script will never receive a reply, so the promise will never be resolved. That’s fine if the caller isn’t expecting a response and doesn’t need to know that the message was received. If there’s good coordination between the people writing the background code and the content script code, it may be perfectly fine not to send a response. The safest route is probably to always send back a null response to indicate that the message was received, though this adds communication overhead within Chrome.  2. The results from the tabs are collected by $.when and passed as arguments to the done callback function. The simple code we showed in the example just happens to ignore its arguments.  Accessing Chrome Local Storage 1. This is pretty straightforward:  function get keys {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;      chrome.storage.local.get keys, function result {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve result ;         }     } ;  86     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges       return deferred.promise  ; }  function getBytesInUse keys {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;      chrome.storage.local.getBytesInUse keys, function bytesInUse {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve bytesInUse ;         }     } ;      return deferred.promise  ; }  function remove keys {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;      chrome.storage.local.remove keys, function  {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve  ;         }     } ;      return deferred.promise  ; }  function clear  {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;      chrome.storage.local.clear function  {         if  chrome.runtime.lasterror {             deferred.reject chrome.runtime.lasterror.message ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve  ;         }     } ;      return deferred.promise  ; }  2. The node.js Redis package provides an API call for the Redis get command. The  node.js Redis API signature is:  Accessing Chrome Local Storage      87   get 'hash-key', function err, result  {        Check for error, use result, etc. } ;  The callback function is called with two arguments, an error and a result, as is common in node.js APIs. The caller should check to see if an error occurred and if not, it can use the result. Writing a promise-returning replacement is quite straightforward:  var redis = require 'redis' ,     client = redis.createClient  ,     $ = require 'jquery-deferred' ;  function redisGet hashkey {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;      client.get hashkey, function err, result {         if  err {             deferred.reject err ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve result ;         }     } ;      return deferred.promise  ; }  There are of course many other Redis API calls you could make promise-returning versions of. Not surprisingly, you can also find a full promise-based API, though note that it is based on Promises A+, not on jQuery deferreds.  Running Promise-Returning Functions One by One 1. In the loop in synchronously, as well as shifting out the task function, also shift a context. Pass the context to apply as its first argument  instead of passing null . When you call synchronously, you’ll obviously need to pass in a context for each function.  2. Any arguments to the function passed to then are ignored because they will contain the return result of the previously run function  or undefined when the first func‐ tion is run . The values are ignored because we are not passing along a modified result, we’re just running the functions  whose arguments are passed in the tasks list and given to apply .  3. To allow for calling functions that do not return promises, we need to check the return result from apply. If it has a method called promise that is a function, we  88     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges   can call it and return the result. Otherwise, we just return the value that comes back from apply. Note that this is also how jQuery guesses that a value is a deferred. It’s not foolproof! This is pretty much what $.when does when you pass it a single argument, so you could just make a simple change and use $.when:  function synchronously tasks {     var i, task, func,         promise = $.Deferred  .resolve  .promise  ,         makeRunner = function func, args {             return function  {                 return $.when func.apply null, args  ;             };         };     for  i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++ {         task = tasks[i];         func = task.shift  ;         promise = promise.then makeRunner func, task  ;     }     return promise; }  4. If done is used instead of then, the promise will fire all its attached callbacks as soon as the first animation is complete. That is, it will not wait until the second animation is finished. The second animation is a done callback on the promise, just like any other. This is a common source of error, and can be hard to debug. A solid under‐ standing of deferred dynamics  see “Deferred Dynamics” on page 18  will make you less likely to write code like this in the first place.  5. The $.when version will start both animations at the same time instead of running  them one after the other. It is not necessary to call promise   on the result of animate because $.when will do that for you. Note that animate doesn’t return a promise directly; it’s necessary to call promise   on its result to get one.  A Promise Pool with an emptyPromise Method 1. Create a deferred, initialize it, and return its promise in one statement:  function emptyPromise  {     return $.Deferred function deferred {         waitingForEmpty.push deferred ;     } .promise  ; }  2. The promise returned by emptyPromise will not be resolved until after at least one  promise is added to the pool and the pool subsequently empties.  A Promise Pool with an emptyPromise Method      89   3. Change the emptyPromise function as follows:  function emptyPromise checkImmediately {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ;     if  checkImmediately && inProgress.length === 0 {         return deferred.resolve  .promise  ;     }     else {         waitingForEmpty.push deferred ;         return deferred.promise  ;     } }  4. The shutdown handler could look like this: app.get ' shutdown', function req, res {     if  shuttingDown === false {         shuttingDown = true;         pool.emptyPromise  .done function  {             pool.add flushAvatarCache   ;             pool.add sendShutdownEmail   ;             pool.add flushLogs   ;             pool.emptyPromise  .done function  {                 res.send 200 ;                 process.exit 0 ;             } ;         } ;     }     else {         res.send 200 ;     } } ;  5. This one’s up to you! 6. You could maintain an integer request ID, incremented on each call to add. Use a closure to capture its current value when setting up the always callback. The ID would be an attribute of inProgress  now a JavaScript object . So when a promise is resolved or rejected, the promise can immediately be found in inProgress. You could maintain a count of the pool size to know when to resolve waiting deferreds, or else use the jQuery convenience function isEmptyObject.  7. Keep a list of responses that are awaiting an HTTP 200 status reply  shutdownRes ponses in the code below . When the first shutdown request is received, arrange to later respond to all shutdown requests  including those which arrive during the shutdown  in the done callback that runs after the pool empties for the second time. You might try something like this:  var express = require 'express' ,     app = express  ,     pool = createPromisePool  ,     shuttingDown = false,  90     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges       shutdownResponses = [];  app.get ' ', function req, res {     if  shuttingDown {         res.redirect 'http:  example.com' ;     }     else {         pool.add handleRequest req, res  ;     } } ;  app.get ' shutdown', function req, res {     shutdownResponses.push res ;      if  shuttingDown === false {         shuttingDown = true;         pool.emptyPromise  .done function  {             pool.add flushAvatarCache   ;             pool.add sendShutdownEmail   ;             pool.add flushLogs   ;             pool.emptyPromise  .done function  {                 for  var i = 0; i < shutdownResponses.length; i++ {                     shutdownResponses[i].send 200 ;                 }                 process.exit 0 ;             } ;         } ;     } } ;  app.listen 9999 ;  Note that we again use emptyPromise twice. Bonus challenge! If the shutdownResponses.push res ; line were moved after the if block that follows it, we might be introducing a subtle bug. Can you see what it is? Hint: What happens if, on the first shutdown call, the request pool is already empty and the three administrative cleanup functions complete instantaneously?  Displaying Google Maps 1. There are tons of JavaScript LRU cache packages around. Use one that provides a key value store API. The keys in our case can be a latitude longitude string and each value will be a data URI. The LRU cache will replace lastKey and lastDataURI. 2. When a data URI has been retrieved from Google, getMap calls localStorageSet,  but discards its return value.  Displaying Google Maps      91   We did this for simplicity—and because there’s not much that could be done at this point, other than logging or perhaps retrying a failed call. If the call fails and the last value isn’t cached as a result, it’s not fatal—the application continues to work, albeit with less effective caching. In production code you’d probably want to do something, but showing an error message to a user is probably out of the question and logging will likely go unnoticed. Maybe the error could be silently reported via a server call.  3. Sorry, you’re on your own! 4. Use the example in “Short-Term Memoization of In-Progress Function Calls” on  page 52 to keep track of in-flight Google API requests.  Communicating with a Web Worker 1. Log the message in an else branch you add to the if  requests.hasOwnProper  ty id   in handleResponse.  2. If you’re not sure where to keep the timestamp for each request, the answer to the next challenge will help. The reason the request times build up is that the web worker is also run in a single thread and can only do one thing at a time.  3. Here’s how we’d do it:  function createWebWorker sourceFile {      var queue = [],    IDs of requests yet to be sent.         requests = {},    Key is request ID, value is request spec.         requestId = 0,    Incremented on each message sent.         worker = new Worker sourceFile ,         workerState = 'idle',          processQueue = function  {             var id, request;             if  workerState === 'idle' && queue.length > 0 {                 workerState = 'busy';                 id = queue.shift  ;                 request = requests[id];                 worker.postMessage {                     method: request.method,                     payload: request.payload,                     requestId: id                 } ;             }         },          enqueueRequest = function method, payload {             var deferred = $.Deferred  ,                 id = requestId++;  92     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges               requests[id] = {                 deferred: deferred,                 method: method,                 payload: payload,             };             queue.push id ;             processQueue  ;             return deferred.promise  ;         },          handleResponse = function response {             var deferred, id;             if  response.hasOwnProperty 'requestId'  {                 workerState = 'idle';                 id = response.requestId;                 if  requests.hasOwnProperty id  {                     deferred = requests[id];                     delete requests[id];                     if  response.hasOwnProperty 'result'  {                         deferred.resolve response.result ;                     }                     else {                         deferred.reject response.error ;                     }                 }                 processQueue  ;             }             else {                    An unsolicited message from the worker.                 if  response.type === 'log' {                     console.log 'Worker says:', response.message ;                 }                 else {                     console.log 'Unknown message from worker:', response ;                 }             }         };      worker.addEventListener 'message', function event {         handleResponse event.data ;     } ;      return {         run: enqueueRequest     }; }  We’ve added a queue of request IDs that have yet to be sent to the worker. To make the code a bit more general, we just return an object with a run function. run takes a method name and a payload and passes these to enqueueRequest, which puts a request specification into requests and adds the request ID to queue. It then calls  Communicating with a Web Worker      93   processQueue, which will send a request to the worker if it’s not busy. Each time we handle a response, processQueue is called again.  4. Based on the code above: in enqueueRequest, store the time the request is received into  the  requests  object,  along  with  the  rest  of  the  request  specification.  In processQueue, add another timestamp to the request specification to record when the queued request is sent to the worker. In handleResponse, log both the time spent in the queue and the time spent processing.  5. Also  based  on  the  above  code:  keep  an  array  of  workers,  each  with  a  state.  In processQueue, look for an idle worker, mark it as busy, and send it the request. In handleResponse, you’ll need to figure out which worker sent the response so you can mark that worker as now being idle. That means you’ll need to save the worker’s index in the request specification in enqueueRequest.  Using Web Sockets 1. Instead of processing the return result of func request.payload  using done and fail callbacks, use $.when, which knows how to handle a nonpromise result, re‐ turning it via a new promise.  2. If the server didn’t send a request ID in a response, the value of deferred in the handleResponse function in the web sockets client will be undefined, which will cause an exception to be raised. The deferred corresponding to that request  as‐ suming the server has not spontaneously sent a response without receiving a re‐ quest  will never fire, so the request will hang indefinitely unless timed out by some other mechanism. The same thing will happen—though for a slightly different rea‐ son—if a request ID that has already been used is sent.  3. You’re on your own! Obviously, the server needs to put its own request IDs into the messages it sends, and the client will need to send them back. You’ll need to make sure that both sides can distinguish between responses to their own outstanding requests and incoming new requests from the other side.  4. The problem is the use of $.when. There is no server-side multiply function, so the corresponding makeRequest promise will be rejected. That causes the imme‐ diate rejection of the promise returned by $.when. You could fix this by using when2  see “when2: An Improved jQuery.when” on page 63  and setting the rejectOn FirstError option to false.  5. The jQuery source code line that causes $.when to reject immediately is in the for loop near the bottom of the when function in deferred.js. It’s this line: .fail  de ferred.reject  .  94     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges   If the call signature of $.when had accepted a list of promises instead of treating all its arguments as promises, it would have been possible to alter its behavior with a flag. See “when2: An Improved jQuery.when” on page 63 for an approach to chang‐ ing this behavior.  Automatically Retrying Failing Deferred Calls 1. This is too easy to warrant even a hint! 2. The problem occurs if the passed function returns a promise that is rejected with no arguments. In that case, the value of value in the error function will be unde fined. If a subsequent call to the passed function returns a promise that is rejected with a non-undefined value, that failure result will be stored in rejectValue. In this case, the first failure result  undefined  is overwritten and will not be returned. You  can  fix  this  small  problem  by  introducing  another  variable,  to  remember whether  a  failure  has  occurred.  Instead  of  testing  the  value  of  rejectValue  in error, test the new variable—and only if no previous failure has occurred, store the passed error value in rejectValue.  3. To reject with the final error, get rid of the rejectValue variable and all its associated code. In the error function, if the number of call attempts is up, reject the deferred with the value received. Similarly, to return all the errors, keep a list of them and call reject with the list once the call limit is reached.  4. The stack never has more than one call to the function passed to retryingCaller. A repeat call to that function is not made until the previous call has completely finished  and has returned an error . The stack has therefore been popped before a repeat call is made.  5. You hopefully won’t need any help with this. Arrange to pass an error-checking  function and call it in the error callback.  Memoization 1. This  is  easy,  assuming  you  know  your  JavaScript.  Pass  a  context  argument  to  memoize and use apply to invoke the passed func function.  2. If func is called with an object, JavaScript will convert it to a string when accessing promises[arg]. This is not very useful because converting an object into a string gets you '[object Object]'. So the memoization would fail horribly—all calls that passed an object would pull out the same memoized value, no matter what contents  Automatically Retrying Failing Deferred Calls      95   the object had. The situation is a teeny tiny bit better for arrays, but only if the array is shallow and doesn’t contain other arrays or objects. One way to fix this is to check  in the returned function  the argument type and use something like JSON.stringify to turn arrays and objects into strings.  3. If func took two arguments, you’d modify memoize to return a function that ac‐ cepted two arguments. It could make the two arguments into a single string for lookup in the promises object  note previous challenge . To generalize this, you’re going to need to loop in some way over the passed argu‐ ments. An obvious approach would be to build up a lookup string  for accessing promises  argument by argument, checking the type of each. There are other ways to skin this cat, though, so we suggest you take a look around on the Web and read some of the many interesting articles.  4. No, this is not a problem. See the summary of “Deferred Dynamics” on page 18 to  understand why.  5. You would need to examine the result of calling func arg . If it appeared to be a promise, you could store it in promises and return it. If not, you’d also want to store the result  perhaps the promises variable could be renamed to results  and return it. In other words, don’t unconditionally call $.when.  6. If you didn’t wrap the func arg  call in $.when, the promises object would obvi‐ ously contain whatever func arg  returned. That could be a promise, but it could be any other value. That’s not a problem, except you’d need to tell the caller of memoize that they should check the type of the return value, if they care. This is true memoization, rather than the version we wrote initially that always stores  and returns  promises.  7. You can write this one yourself. You should store JavaScript objects in the promises object  which you might rename to promiseInfo . Each object would contain a promise and a timestamp. You’d update the timestamp on any call for a previously seen argument. There are two issues to consider here. First, what will happen to the setInterval timer once a  memoization instance goes out of scope and is garbage-collected? Second, what happens if you remove an old item from promiseInfo and it contains a promise that has not yet fired?  Short-Term Memoization of In-Progress Function Calls 1. If the promise is added to the  promises object after the call to  always  which removes the promise from promises , there is the possibility that internalCrea teUser might finish immediately, in which case the  delete would fail and the  96     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges   promise would then be added to promises. That would be very unfortunate! An out-of-date promise would be permanently stored in the  promises object. You might think that this could never happen, but imagine if someday someone speeds up internalCreateUser  perhaps it is memoized or otherwise cached, or perhaps a test suite stubs it out .  2. The problem above is a good example of a general principle you should follow when maintaining deferreds or promises in data structures. First put the deferred into the data structure you’re using to hold them, and only then add callbacks to it to remove it from that data structure when it fires. Never assume that a promise you have received has not already fired.  3. The two are very similar. In both cases, a known result is stored for a finite time and then discarded. With short-term in-progress function call memoization, the result is  effectively  stored in the deferred during the time it takes for the function to complete. With cache expiry  e.g., after a fixed time or on an LRU basis , results are also kept temporarily and then discarded.  Streaming Promise Events 1. The  only  difference  is  that  another  deferred  would  be  created,  by  then.  While then stream, stream, stream  looks cute, we don’t need to modify and pass on the value delivered to the notify method of our deferred, so there’s no need to use then.  2. Here’s how we’d do it. The only point to be careful about is that we should notify the promise about the final resolve or reject of the passed promises before resolving our own deferred:  function eventStream promises {     var i, deferred = $.Deferred  ,         firedCount = 0,         callNotify = function index, type {             return function  {                 deferred.notify {                     index: index,                     type: type,                     args: [].slice.call arguments                  } ;                  if  type === 'resolve'  type === 'reject' {                     if  ++firedCount === promises.length {                            All promised have fired.                         deferred.resolve  ;                     }                 }             };  Streaming Promise Events      97   3. You can clone a promise using delegateEventStream by passing it a handler that  just calls the corresponding method on the deferred it is passed:          };      for  i = 0; i < promises.length; i++ {         promises[i]             .done callNotify i, 'resolve'               .fail callNotify i, 'reject'               .progress callNotify i, 'notify'  ;     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  function clonePromise promise {     var handler = function index, type, args, deferred {         var func;         if  type === 'resolve' {             func = deferred.resolve;         }         else if  type === 'reject' {             func = deferred.reject;         }         else if  type === 'notify' {             func = deferred.notify;         }         func.apply deferred, args ;     };      return delegateEventStream [promise], handler ; }  In case you don’t get the flow of events here, delegateEventStream creates a new promise and returns it, and it’s that promise that clonePromise also returns. When the original promise  passed to clonePromise and passed on to delegateEvent Stream  is resolved or rejected or makes progress, delegateEventStream will call the handler defined in clonePromise with the information about what happened. To effectively clone the original promise, we just make the same thing happen to the new promise  whose deferred has been passed to our handler by delegate EventStream . This is admittedly convoluted, but see if you can think it through. It’s good advanced training for thinking about hooking up multiple deferreds.  Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises 1. By now you shouldn’t need to pause for even a second to solve this. Use fail to add error processing. Remember that your fail callback will receive two arguments: the index of the promise that was rejected, and an error value.  98     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges   2. A no-argument call to fastestPromise will result in a promise, as usual. Unfortu‐ nately, the promise will never fire! You might think there’s no way this could happen —who would be silly enough to call  fastestPromise with no arguments when you’re clearly supposed to give it arguments? But, a call via fastestPromise.ap ply could do it by accidentally supplying an empty argument list. So it’s better to be defensive and to throw some kind of error  or, perhaps, to return an already rejected promise holding some kind of error .  3. You could write something like this:  var lookup = fastestPromiseWithIndex [     emailFromRedis 'joe' ,     emailFromDatabase 'joe'  ]  .then function index, email {     var avatarLookup;     if  index !== 0 {            Add email address to Redis so we have it cached.     }     avatarLookup = fastestPromiseWithIndex [         avatarFromRedis 'joe' ,         avatarFromFilesystem 'joe' ,         avatarFromGravatar email      ] ;      avatarLookup.then function index, avatar {         if  index !== 0 {                The response was not from Redis.                Add avatar info to Redis so we have it cached.         }          if  index !== 2 {                The response was not from Gravatar.                Cancel the outstanding Gravatar network request.         }          return avatar;     } ;      return avatarLookup.promise  ; } ;  This introduces a slowdown, though, as all requests to look up an avatar now start with a lookup of the user’s email address  to pass to Gravatar . This may be accept‐ able  due to the Redis caching of email addresses , but in practice you might want to try the Redis and database avatar lookups first. Only if they fail should you look up the email address and make the call to Gravatar.  Getting the First Result from a Set of Promises      99   Note that in a real-world scenario you would need to build this functionality using delegateEventStream, not  fastestPromiseWithIndex, as explained in “delega‐ teEventStream Redux” on page 59.  4. The following will work, with the usual caveat that testing whether an object is a  promise is not bulletproof:  function fastestPromiseWithIndex promiseInfo {     var item, deferred = $.Deferred  ,         makeDone = function index {             return function result {                 deferred.resolve index, result ;             };         },         makeFail = function index {             return function error {                 deferred.reject index, error ;             };         };      for  var i = 0; i < promiseInfo.length; i++ {         item = promiseInfo[i];         if  item.promise && jQuery.isFunction item.promise  {             item.promise  .done makeDone i  .fail makeFail i  ;         }         else {             deferred.resolve i, item ;             break;         }     }      return deferred.promise  ; }  5. In eventHandler where we check if type === 'reject', examine args. If a tran‐  sient network failure is indicated, don’t call deferred.reject.  6. Exactly as above, handle this when promises are rejected. Differentiate between the  different reasons for the rejection.  7. In eventHandler, whenever a promise is resolved, we need to check if the status is a 404 and, if so, whether the index is 0 or 1. In either of those cases, arrange to add the avatar to the cache that missed. We can only populate the caches once we actually have the avatar, but we won’t yet have it when the fast cache lookups fail. If you’ve been paying attention, a solution should spring to mind! Just add a done callback to the deferred’s promise. When the deferred fires later with the eventual result, we can update either or both of the Redis and filesystem caches, as needed. Try some‐ thing like this:  function eventHandler index, type, args, deferred {     if  type === 'resolve' {  100     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges           if  args[0].status === 404 {             if  index === 0 {                    Redis look-up failed.                 deferred.promise  .done function avatar {                        Add avatar to Redis cache.                 } ;             }             else if  index === 1 {                    Filesystem look-up failed.                 deferred.promise  .done function avatar {                        Add avatar to filesystem cache.                 } ;             }         }         else {             deferred.resolve.apply deferred, args ;         }     }     else if  type === 'reject' {         deferred.reject.apply deferred, args ;     } }  8. The bug will be triggered if all three lookup functions resolve with a 404 status. In that case, the deferred  created by delegateEventStream and passed to eventHan dler  will never be fired. An easy way to fix this is to write a function, makeEvent Handler, that returns the eventHandler function. makeEventHandler can have a private variable that counts the number of resolved deferreds. If all three deferreds resolve with a 404 status, eventHandler can reject or resolve the deferred in some way, or set up further processing to try to get a result.  A Deferred Queue 1. A priority queue can naturally be implemented with a heap data structure. But don’t reinvent the wheel more than strictly necessary, unless you want to learn about heaps  by  implementing  one.  There  are  already  many  JavaScript  priority  queue implementations.  2. You’re largely on your own on this one, sorry! To help with the thinking, it is useful to return a task identifier from put. A task identifier can then be passed to the delete and reprioritize functions, allowing those elements to be found in the priority queue. One of us wrote a Twisted  Python  deferred priority queue with delete and repri‐ oritize functions that may be a useful point of reference.  A Deferred Queue      101   when2: An Improved jQuery.when 1. The promise returned by when2 would never be resolved in the cases where you  passed it no promise arguments.  2. There would be no change in the behavior of  when2, since it doesn’t matter if a deferred is resolved or rejected multiple times. The change would be a slight re‐ duction in code size and a slight increase in run time. 3. You might change the end of when2 to look like this:  for  i = 0; i < length; i++ {     if  resolveValues[i] &&         jQuery.isFunction resolveValues[i].promise  {         promiseArgFound = true;         resolveValues[i].promise               .done doneFunc i               .fail failFunc i               .progress progressFunc i  ;     }     else {         resolveContexts[i] = window;         --remaining;     } }  if  !promiseArgFound {     if  resolveOnFirstSuccess && length {         deferred.resolveWith window, [0, resolveValues[0]] ;     }     else {         deferred.resolveWith resolveContexts, resolveValues ;     } }  return deferred.promise  ;  4. When we have only one promise, we can use resolveOnFirstSuccess and the first to finish  either the wait promise or the promise we want to time out  will send its result to the done callback. But if we have multiple promises that we want the results from  assuming they’ll all complete before the timeout , we’ll only ever get the result of one of them  the first to resolve .  5. The easiest solution is to take what’s currently called when the deferreds make pro‐ gress and instead call it when the deferreds are resolved. That’s easily done: just change the callback-adding code in the for loop at the end of when2 to look like this:  resolveValues[i].promise       .done progressFunc i    102     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges       .done doneFunc i       .fail failFunc i  ;  Note that we call  done with the progress function first. That way, the progress callbacks attached to the when2 promise will get notified of all deferreds as they finish, before the master deferred is finally resolved with all values. If we had instead written:  .done doneFunc i  .done progressFunc i    the “progress” completion of the last deferred to resolve would not be reported because the when2 deferred would have already been resolved by the function re‐ turned by doneFunc i .  Timing Out Promises 1. If we removed the clearTimeout call in deactivatingWait, nothing would change. The timeout would be triggered, but the deferred would have already been resolved. Rejecting a deferred after it has already been resolved has no effect  see “Deferred Dynamics” on page 18 if you’re unclear on this . The clearTimeout call is only included for good housekeeping, and it doesn’t leave someone reading your code to wonder why it’s not cleared  an explanatory comment would help .  2. If rejectOnFirstError were not true  or missing from options , timeout expiry would not cause the when2 deferred to be rejected. when2WithTimeout would be completely broken because it would never time out.  Controlling Your Own Destiny 1. deferredFromPromise can be made into a one-liner by passing an initialization  argument to $.Deferred   as follows:  function deferredFromPromise promise {     return $.Deferred function deferred {         promise             .done deferred.resolve              .fail deferred.reject              .progress deferred.notify ;     } ; }  2. Just return the deferred! There’s no need to extract its promise and pass that to  deferredFromPromise.  3. The  code  will  still  work  just  fine.  The  deferred  returned  by  deferredFromPro mise will already be resolved. Because the passed promise has fired, the addition of  Timing Out Promises      103   callbacks to it in deferredFromPromise will cause deferred to be resolved or re‐ jected  as appropriate  immediately.  Deactivating a Promise 1. The new promise is returned so the result of calling deactivate can be chained. Given that you’ve just deactivated the promise, though, you’re highly unlikely to want to add any more callbacks to it! Returning the promise is therefore of ques‐ tionable utility.  2. Change unlessDeactivated to use apply, as follows:  function unlessDeactivated  {     return function  {         if  deactivated === false {             func.apply deferred, [].slice.call arguments  ;         }     }; }  3. There are two obvious ways. You could create a new object and copy the public methods  done, fail, etc.  from newPromise to it, as well as giving it a deactiva ted  method.  That  would  work,  but  it’s  also  not  future-proof.  If  jQuery  adds  a deactivate method to promises, that method would not be accessible from the artificial promise returned by deactivatablePromise; only our deactivate meth‐ od could be called. A better solution would be to change deactivatablePromise to return a list of two things: the new promise and a separate deactivate function.  4. Here’s how you might do it:  function controllablePromise promise {     var deferred = $.Deferred  ,         deactivated = false,         unlessDeactivated = function func {             return function  {                 if  deactivated === false {                     return func.apply deferred,                                       [].slice.call arguments  ;                 }                 return deferred;             };         },         resolve = unlessDeactivated deferred.resolve ,         resolveWith = unlessDeactivated deferred.resolveWith ,          reject = unlessDeactivated deferred.reject ,         rejectWith = unlessDeactivated deferred.rejectWith ,  104     Appendix A: Hints for Selected Challenges           notify = unlessDeactivated deferred.notify ,         notifyWith = unlessDeactivated deferred.notifyWith ;      promise.done resolve .fail reject .progress notify ;      deferred.resolve = resolve;     deferred.resolveWith = resolveWith;      deferred.reject = reject;     deferred.rejectWith = rejectWith;      deferred.notify = notify;     deferred.notifyWith = notifyWith;      deferred.deactivate = function  {         deactivated = true;         return deferred;     };      return deferred; }  See the previous challenge to learn why this approach isn’t 100% safe. Bonus challenge! Why does the function returned by unlessDeactivated return the deferred? Why did the version in “Deactivating a Promise” on page 74 not do so?  Deactivating a Promise      105    APPENDIX B The Promises A+ Specification  An open standard for sound, interoperable JavaScript promise—by implementers, for implementers.1 A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its then method, which registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled. This specification details the behavior of the then method, providing an interoperable base which all Promises A+ conformant promise implementations can be depended on to provide. As such, the specification should be considered very stable. Although the Promises A+  organization  may  occasionally  revise  this  specification  with  minor backward-compatible changes to address newly-discovered corner cases, we will inte‐ grate large or backward-incompatible only after careful consideration, discussion, and testing. Historically, Promises A+ clarifies the behavioral clauses of the earlier Promises A pro‐ posal, extending it to cover de facto behaviors and omitting parts that are underspecified or problematic. Finally, the core Promises A+ specification does not deal with how to create, fulfill, or reject promises, choosing instead to focus on providing an interoperable then method. Future work in companion specifications may touch on these subjects.  1. This appendix reproduces the Promises A+ specification.  107   Terminology 1. “promise” is an object or function with a then method whose behavior conforms  to this specification.  2. “thenable” is an object or function that defines a then method. 3. “value” is any legal JavaScript value  including undefined, a thenable, or a promise . 4. “exception” is a value that is thrown using the throw statement. 5. “reason” is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.  Requirements Promise States A promise must be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.  1. When pending, a promise:  a. may transition to either the fulfilled or rejected state.  2. When fulfilled, a promise:  a. must not transition to any other state. b. must have a value, which must not change.  3. When rejected, a promise:  a. must not transition to any other state. b. must have a reason, which must not change.  Here, “must not change” means immutable identity  i.e., === , but does not imply deep immutability.  The then Method A promise must provide a then method to access its current or eventual value or reason. A promise’s then method accepts two arguments:  promise.then onFulfilled, onRejected   1. Both onFulfilled and onRejected are optional arguments:  a. If onFulfilled is not a function, it must be ignored. b. If onRejected is not a function, it must be ignored.  108     Appendix B: The Promises A+ Specification   2. If onFulfilled is a function,  a. It must be called after promise is fulfilled, with promise’s value as its first argu‐  ment.  b. It must not be called before promise is fulfilled. c. It must not be called more than once.  3. If onRejected is a function,  argument.  b. It must not be called before promise is rejected. c. It must not be called more than once.  a. It must be called after  promise is rejected, with  promise’s reason as its first  4. onFulfilled or onRejected must not be called until the execution context stack  contains only platform code.2  5. onFulfilled and onRejected must be called as functions  i.e., with no this value3 . 6. then may be called multiple times on the same promise.  a. If when promise is fulfilled, all respective onFulfilled callbacks must execute  in the order of their originating calls to then.  b. If when promise is rejected, all respective onRejected callbacks must execute  in the order of their originating calls to then.  7. then must return a promise.4  promise2 = promise1.then onFulfilled, onRejected ;  a. If either onFulfilled or onRejected returns a value x, run the Promise Reso‐  lution Procedure [[Resolve]] promise2, x .  b. If either onFulfilled or onRejected throws an exception e, promise2 must be  rejected with e as the reason.  fulfilled with the same value.  c. If onFulfilled is not a function and promise1 is fulfilled, promise2 must be  2. Here “platform code” means engine, environment, and promise implementation code. In practice, this re‐ quirement ensures that onFulfilled and onRejected execute asynchronously, after the event loop turn in which then is called, and with a fresh stack. This can be implemented with either a “macro-task” mechanism such as setTimeout or setImmediate, or with a “micro-task” mechanism such as MutationObserver or process.nextTick. Since the promise implementation is considered platform code, it may itself contain a task-scheduling queue or “trampoline” in which the handlers are called.  3. That is, in strict mode this will be undefined inside of them; in sloppy mode, it will be the global object. 4. Implementations may allow promise2 === promise1, provided the implementation meets all requirements. Each implementation should document whether it can produce promise2 === promise1 and under what conditions.  Requirements      109   d. If  onRejected is not a function and  promise1 is rejected,  promise2 must be  rejected with the same reason.  The Promise Resolution Procedure The promise resolution procedure is an abstract operation taking as input a promise and a value, which we denote as [[Resolve]] promise, x . If x is a thenable, it attempts to make  promise adopt the state of  x, under the assumption that  x behaves at least somewhat like a promise. Otherwise, it fulfills promise with the value x. This treatment of thenables allows promise implementations to interoperate, as long as they expose a Promises A+-compliant then method. It also allows Promises A+ im‐ plementations to “assimilate” nonconformant implementations with reasonable then methods. To run [[Resolve]] promise, x , perform the following steps:  1. If promise and x refer to the same object, reject promise with a TypeError as the  reason.  2. If x is a promise, adopt its state:5  a. If x is pending, promise must remain pending until x is fulfilled or rejected. b. If when x is fulfilled, fulfill promise with the same value. c. If when x is rejected, reject promise with the same reason.  3. Otherwise, if x is an object or function,  a. Let then be x.then.6 b. If retrieving the property x.then results in a thrown exception e, reject promise  with e as the reason.  c. If then is a function, call it with x as this, first argument resolvePromise, and  second argument rejectPromise, where: i. If when resolvePromise is called with a value y, run [[Resolve]] promise,  y .  ii. If when rejectPromise is called with a reason r, reject promise with r.  5. Generally, it will only be known that x is a true promise if it comes from the current implementation. This clause allows the use of implementation-specific means to adopt the state of known-conformant promises. 6. This procedure of first storing a reference to x.then, then testing that reference, and then calling that refer‐ ence, avoids multiple accesses to the x.then property. Such precautions are important for ensuring consis‐ tency in the face of an accessor property, whose value could change between retrievals.  110     Appendix B: The Promises A+ Specification   iii. If both resolvePromise and rejectPromise are called, or multiple calls to the same argument are made, the first call takes precedence, and any further calls are ignored.  iv. If calling then throws an exception e,  i. If resolvePromise or rejectPromise have been called, ignore it. ii. Otherwise, reject promise with e as the reason.  d. If then is not a function, fulfill promise with x.  4. If x is not an object or function, fulfill promise with x.  If a promise is resolved with a thenable that participates in a circular thenable chain, such that the recursive nature of [[Resolve]] promise, thenable  eventually causes [[Resolve]] promise, thenable  to be called again, following the above algorithm will lead to infinite recursion. Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to detect such recursion and reject promise with an informative TypeError as the reason.7  7. Implementations should not set arbitrary limits on the depth of thenable chains, and assume that beyond that arbitrary limit the recursion will be infinite. Only true cycles should lead to a TypeError; if an infinite chain of distinct thenables is encountered, recursing forever is the correct behavior.

He has worked extensively with deferreds for the last 7 years and, strange to say, has become passionate about them. In particular, he loves how elegantly deferreds can be clicked together to build more complex things and how thinking about them has broadened his perspective on programming. There’s more about Terry on his out-of- date web pages and he also blogs regularly. He can be reached at terry@jon.es. Nicholas H. Tollervey is a classically trained musician, philosophy graduate, teacher, writer, and software developer. He’s just like this biography: concise, honest, and full of useful  information.  He  blogs  at  ntoll.org,  tweets  as  ntoll  and  can  be  reached  at ntoll@ntoll.org.

Orchestrating asynchronous function calls in JavaScript often leads to callback hell, but there is a reliable way to avoid this painful state of affairs. With this concise and simple guide, you’ll learn how to use jQuery deferreds and promises, an elegant approach for managing asynchronous calls in both client and server applications.

This book contains 18 examples that use deferreds to solve progressively challenging real-world programming problems, along with 75 stimulating puzzles (and their solutions) that will help you understand how and when to use deferreds. You’ll learn new tricks in a fun way, and become immersed in the practice of event-based programming.
