I’ve worked with so many great  people, and it’s virtually impossible not to forget someone in a list like this, but among  the crew for sure are Ami Knox, Arockia Rajan Dhurai, Beth Christmas, Dulcy Nirmala  Chellappa, Chris Mills, Christine Ricketts, Dominic Shakeshaft, Douglas Pundick, Frank  Parnell, Frank Pohlmann, Gary Cornell, Jill Balzano, Julie Miller, Katie Stence, Kelly  Gunther, Kelly Winquist, Kevin Shea, Kim Wimpsett, Kimberly van der Elst, Krishnan  Sathyamurthy, Laura Cheu, Laura Esterman, Leah Weissburg, Leonard Cuellar, Liz  Welch, Louise Corrigan, Marilyn Smith, Michelle Lowman, Nancy Chen, Nicole Faraclas,  Nirmal Selvaraj, Richard Dal Porto, Sharon Wilkey, Sofia Marchant, Stephanie Parker,  Steve Anglin, Tina Nielsen, and Tracy Brown Collins.  As I said, I’m sure I’ve forgotten someone, but rest assured it was not on purpose!   Thank you all for giving me a shot and allowing me to continue this journey. I most  definitely could not have done it alone and I thank you all, unreservedly!  xix   Introduction  You know, when I started learning how to program, it was a piece of cake!  You’d turn on the computer and be greeted by a nice little “Ready” prompt. You’d   start typing in some code  BASIC , and eventually, you’d type run, hit Enter, and watch  whatever it was you put in there spit back something  my first program was a man drawn  with various keyboard characters doing jumping jacks . You might save that program to a  cassette – yes, kids, a cassette! – and hand it to your friends if you wanted to share.  But that was it. It was just that easy. Nowadays, though, the story is very different. Writing even a trivial application now involves layers upon layers of abstractions and  complexities that you must mix together, like baking the world’s most complicated cake,  hoping it all works in the end. Then, should you want to distribute the technological  terror you’ve constructed  sorry, Aldearan , you’ve got even more challenges to  overcome.  How anyone learns to program from scratch these days, I’m not sure! But I’m hoping to help there! With this book, I’m going to look at the ingredients that go into baking a cake – err,  building an application – these days. To be sure, it won’t cover everything. And no one  recipe is necessarily the same anyway – there are lots of choices available to a developer  now. But I believe I’ve chosen the ones most commonly used to build modern full-stack  applications.  What exactly is a full-stack application anyway? Well, simply put, it’s an application  that includes both a front-end “client,” like a web site, and a back-end “server,” like, well,  a server! We’re talking about building an application that combines those two halves  into a coherent whole. Most application development these days is web-based in some  way  where “web” doesn’t have to mean something available on the public Internet, but  something built with web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS , so that’s what  we’re going to be doing in this book.  To do this, we’re going to use React, which is one of the most popular libraries for  building clients out there today. And we’ll use Node.js, which is a popular choice for  back-end development. We’re also going to use TypeScript, a language that enhances   xxi   InTroduCTIon  JavaScript on both sides of the fence to make our coding lives better. We’re going to  touch on several other tools that relate to all of this including Babel and Webpack. We’ll  talk about some strategies for connecting the client to the server including REST and  WebSockets. Finally, you’ll learn about packaging up applications using the very popular  Docker.  All this will be combined to build two full, real applications. This way, it’s not just  simple, contrived examples. No, it’ll be real code, practical solutions to real problems  encountered in building them, and real techniques for putting all these pieces together  and making sense of all this complexity.  In the end, you’ll have a solid foundation for building modern full-stack applications   that you can go forward with on your own to create greatness.  I mean it’ll never be as great as my guy doing jumping jacks written in BASIC and   loaded off a cassette, but you gotta have goals.   So let’s get to it. There’s work to be done, learning to be accomplished, and, I hope,   fun to be had!  xxii   CHAPTER 1  Server-Side Action: Node  and NPM  Welcome to the book! I hope you’ve got a comfy chair under you, a tasty drink on  the table next to you and perhaps a light snack  may I suggest some dark chocolate  biscotti? , and your brain ready to soak up a ton of knowledge on modern web  development, ‘cause that’s what the show is all about and the curtains are about to be  drawn!  In this book, we’ll be building two full apps that will demonstrate all the concepts   that we’ll be discussing along the way in a practical manner. Far from being just simple,  contrived bits of code, these are two full apps which are functional and useful  and  even fun, given that one of them is a game, which will provide you a whole new way of  looking at coding . As we do so, you’ll get insight into the thinking that went into them,  their design and architecture, so you get a holistic picture of what’s involved in building  something like these two apps. You will even, here and there, get some notes about  issues I faced and how I resolved them, things that will almost certainly help you achieve  your goals as you charge onward into your own projects.  To start, we’ll look at what is most usually  though not exclusively, as you’ll learn!   the purview of the server side. Remember that we’re talking “full-stack” development  here, which means you’ll be learning about coding clients as well as the server code they  make use of in order to form a cohesive, whole application. In this chapter, we’ll begin by  looking at two extremely popular tools for developing servers: Node.js and NPM.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_1  1   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM   Of JavaScript Runtimes and Building  Mostly   Servers Ryan Dahl – that cat has some talent, I tell ya!  Ryan is the creator of a fantastic piece of software called Node.js  or just plain Node,   as it is often written, and as I’ll write it from here on out . Ryan first presented Node at  the European JSConf in 2009, and it was quickly recognized as a potential game-changer,  as evidenced by the standing ovation his presentation received  I presume Ryan is an  excellent presenter generally as well .  Node is a platform for running primarily, though not exclusively, server-side   code that has high performance and is capable of handling large request loads with  ease. It is based on the most widely used language on the planet today: JavaScript. It’s  straightforward to get started with and understand, yet it puts tremendous power in the  hands of developers, in large part thanks to its asynchronous and event-driven model  of programming. In Node, almost everything you do is nonblocking, meaning code  won’t hold up the processing of other request threads. Most types of I O, which is where  blocking comes into play most, are asynchronous in Node, whether it’s network calls  or file system calls or database calls. This, plus the fact that to execute code, Node uses  Google’s popular and highly tuned V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers its  Chrome browser, makes it very high performance and able to handle a large request load   assuming that you as the developer don’t botch things of course! .  It’s also worth noting that, as weird as it may sound, Node is single-threaded. It at   first seems like this would be a performance bottleneck, but in fact, it’s a net benefit  because it avoids context-switching. However, this is a little bit of a misnomer in that  it’s more correct to say that Node is event-driven and single-threaded with background  workers. When you fire off some type of I O request, Node will generally spawn a new  thread for that. But, while it’s doing its work, that single event-driven thread continues  executing your code. All of this is managed with an event queue mechanism so that  the callbacks for those I O operations are fired, back on that single thread, when the  responses come back. All of this means that there is no  or at least minimal  context-  switching between threads but also that the single thread is never sitting idle  unless  there is literally no work to do of course , so you wind up with that net positive benefit I  mentioned.  2   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  in later chapters, you’ll see that node isn’t specific to the server side of   Note  the equation, and in fact, you don’t always build apps with node; sometimes you  use it to install and execute tools for various purposes on your own development  machine. hold on to that thought; we’ll be coming back to before long a few  chapters from now.  None of these technical details are especially important to use as a Node developer,   but the performance it yields is what makes it no wonder that so many significant players  and sites have adopted Node to one degree or another. These aren’t minor outfits we’re  talking about, we’re talking names you doubtless know, including DuckDuckGo, eBay,  LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Walmart, and Yahoo, to name just a few examples.  These are large businesses that require top-tier performance, and Node can deliver on  that promise  again, with the caveat that you as the developer don’t mess things up,  because that’s always possible .  Node is a first-class runtime environment, meaning that you can do such things as  interacting with the local file system, access relational databases, call remote systems,  and much more. In the past, you’d have to use a “proper” runtime, such as Java or .Net  to do all this; JavaScript wasn’t a player in that space. With Node, this is no longer true. It  can compete not only on performance but also in terms of what capabilities it provides  to developers. If you can think of it, chances are you can do it with Node, and that wasn’t  always the case with JavaScript.  To be clear, Node isn’t in and of itself a server. You can’t just start up Node and   make HTTP requests to it from a web browser. It won’t do anything in response to your  requests by default. No, to use Node as a server, you must write some  straightforward  and concise, as you’ll see  code that then runs on the Node “runtime.” Yes, you effectively  write your own web server and app server, if you want to split hairs  or potentially FTP,  Telnet, or any other type of server you might wish to . That’s a very odd thing to do as  a developer – we usually apply the “don’t reinvent the wheel” mantra for stuff like that  and pull one of the hundreds of existing options off the shelf. Plus, writing such servers  sounds  and probably actually is  daunting to most developers, and for good reason! To  be sure, it absolutely would be if you tried to write a web server from scratch in many  other languages, especially if you want it to do more than just serve static content files.  But not with Node!  3   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  But remember, acting as a server is just one capability that Node provides as a   JavaScript runtime, and it can provide this functionality only if you, as a developer, feed it  the code it needs to do so! In fact, a great many developer tools, and other types of apps,  use Node as their runtime nowadays. Node really is all over the place!  Note  as you’ll see, react, Webpack, and typeScript, three things that are primary  focuses of this book  docker being the outlier , use node to run and or to be  installed  well, npM is used to install them if we’re being accurate, but we’ll get to  npM in just a moment . these are tools, not servers, which is the main point: node  is useful for much more than just creating servers!  Node allows you to use the same language and knowledge on both client and server,   something that was difficult to accomplish before. In fact, aside from Java and some  Microsoft technologies  see project Blazor, which seeks to do the same thing with C,  if you’re curious , there never has really been an opportunity to do so until Node came  along. It’s a pretty compelling opportunity.  Another critical aspect of Node is a driving design goal of the project, which   is keeping its core functionality to an absolute minimum and providing extended  functionality by way of APIs  in the form of JavaScript modules  that you can pick and  choose from as needed. Node gets out of your way as much as possible and allows you  only to introduce the complexity you really need, when you need it. Node ships with an  extensive library of such modules, but each must be imported into your code, and then  there are literally thousands of other modules that you can bring in as needed, some of  which you’ll see as we progress throughout this book.  In addition to all of this, getting, installing, and running Node are trivial exercises,  regardless of your operating system preference. There are no complicated installs with  all sorts of dependencies to manage, nor is there a vast set of configuration files to mess  with before you can bring up a server and handle requests. It’s a five-minute exercise,  depending on the speed of your Internet connection and how fast you can type! There  is also no required tooling to work with Node. In fact, a simple text editor is enough, in  simplest terms  though that isn’t to say you won’t want a robust IDE with Node support  later, but at least for this book I won’t be assuming anything other than Notepad or some  equivalent text editor .  4   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  All of this makes working with Node so much more straightforward than many   competing options while providing you with top-notch performance and load handling  capabilities. Moreover, it does so with a consistent technological underpinning as that  which you develop your client applications.  That’s Node in a nutshell! Next, let’s see about getting it onto your machine so that you can start playing with   some code together and we can look at Node in a little more depth.  Note  if you aren’t a JavaScript expert, don’t worry, we won’t be getting too fancy.  even when we get to the apps, i’ll consciously keep things as simple as possible. it  is expected that you have some experience with JavaScript though, but you don’t  need to be Brendan eich or doug Crockford  but if you have no experience with  typeScript, that’s fine; we’ll start from square one with it later .   First Baby Steps with Node: Installation To get started, there’s only one address to remember:  http:  nodejs.org  That’s your one-stop shop for all things Node, beginning, right from the front page,   with downloading it, as you can see in Figure 1-1.  5   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  Figure 1-1.  Node has a simple web site, but it gets the job done!  Usually, I would tell you to install the latest version available, but in this case, it might   be better to choose a long-term support  LTS  version, because they tend to be more  stable. However, it shouldn’t  he said, with fingers crossed  matter which you choose, for  the purposes of this book. For the record, however, I developed all the code using version  10.16.3, so if you encounter any problems, I would suggest choosing that version, which  you can get from the Other Downloads link and then the Previous Releases link  you’ll  be able to download any past version you like from there .  The download will install in whatever fashion is appropriate for your system, and   I leave this as an exercise for the reader. For example, on Windows, Node provides a  perfectly ordinary and straightforward installer that will walk you through the necessary   and extremely simple  steps. On macOS X, a typical install wizard will do the same.  6   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  Once the install completes, you will be ready to play with Node. The installer should   have added the Node directory to your path. So, as a first simple test, go to a command  prompt or console prompt, type node, and press Enter. You should be greeted with a   > prompt. Node is now listening for your commands in interactive mode. To confirm,  type the following:  console.log "Hello, you ugly bad of mostly water!" ;  Press Enter, and you should be greeted with something like what you see in Figure 1- 2   platform differences excepted, I’m a Windows guy myself, unashamedly, so that’s where  the screenshots throughout this book will be from, perhaps with a few exceptions later .  Figure 1-2.  The rather uppity  though technically accurate  first greeting, proving  Node is alive  If you find that this doesn’t work, please take a moment and ensure that Node is   indeed in your path. It will make things a lot easier going forward.   More Useful: Executing JavaScript Source Files Interacting with Node in CLI  Command-Line Interface  mode like this is fine and dandy,  but it’s limited. What you really want to do is execute a saved JavaScript file using Node. As it  happens, that’s easy to do. Create a text file named test.js  it could be anything, but that’s a  pretty good choice at this point , and type the following code into it  and, of course, save it :  let a = 5; let b = 3; let c = a * b; console.log `${a} * ${b} = ${c}` ;  7   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  To execute this file, assuming you are in the directory in which the file is located, you   simply must type this:  node test.js  you see in Figure 1-3.  Press Enter after that, and you should be greeted with an execution, such as the one   Figure 1-3.  It ain’t much, but it’s a real program running with Node!  Clearly, this little bit of code is unexceptional, but it does demonstrate that Node can  execute plain old JavaScript just fine. It demonstrates that we’re dealing with at least the  ES2015 specification as well, being more specific, thanks to the use of let and template  literals  or string interpolation if you prefer . You can experiment a bit if you like, and you  will see that Node should run any basic JavaScript that you care to throw at it like this.   Node’s Partner in Crime: NPM NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a companion app that installs  alongside Node  though it is developed separately and can be updated on a different  schedule than Node . With it, you can download packages, which are reusable JavaScript  modules  and any supporting stuff they might need  from a central package registry  or a  private repository if you have one . The central repository you can find at  You can visit it through a web browser and look through all the packages available,   which makes finding exactly what you need easy.  www.npmjs.com  8   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  Using NPM is simple: it’s merely another command to run from a command   prompt, just like Node is. For example, let’s say you create a directory named  MyFirstNodeProject. In it, you execute the following:  npm install express  Here, npm is the CLI program that is NPM itself, and install is one command you  can issue to it. Then, express is an argument to that command, and this is the general  form that most of your interactions with NPM will take.  Note  Most npM commands have a shorter form as well. For example, rather than  type install, you can just type i, and it will do the same thing. Consult the npM  docs for these shortcuts, or be pedantic like your favorite author and always type it  long-form, err, for clarity or something!  If you execute that, you’ll find that a directory called node-modules has been created,   and inside it will be a lot of…well, a lot of stuff you typically don’t need to worry about  too much! In short, though, it’s all the code that makes up the Express module  which  doesn’t matter right now, but is a JavaScript module, or package if you prefer, which we’ll  be using in the MailBag app a few chapters hence… but we’ll get to that app in due time,  we’ve got a fair bit of ground to cover before then, so for now suffice it to say it’s one of  the two apps we’re going to be building with the technologies discussed over the first six  chapters , plus whatever modules Express itself depends on  and whatever they might  depend on, and so on . NPM takes care of fetching all those dependencies for you. You’ll  also notice a file named package-lock.json has been created, and for our purposes  here, you don’t need to worry about that except to know not to delete it as NPM needs it  to do its job.  When you use the install command like this, the modules you name are installed   in the current directory, and this is referred to as the local cache, or project cache. You  can also install the module into what’s called the global cache by adding an argument to  the command:  npm install -g express  9   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  Now, Express will be installed in a location outside the current directory and will   be shared by all Node projects  or, more precisely, it will be available to all projects,  because, of course, a project won’t use a globally installed module unless you tell it to .  Most usually, you will want to install dependencies in the project cache so that different  projects can use different version of a given module than other projects  there is always a  single version of a given module in the global cache, if any are present at all .   A Few More NPM Commands Aside from install, there are many other NPM commands, but you’ll probably only use  a subset most of the time. For example, to find out what modules are installed in your  project, you can issue this command:  npm ls  Like on a *nix system, ls is short for list, and that’s what it does: lists the installed   modules. What you’ll see is a textual tree that shows the modules and then the modules  they depend on. In other words, more will likely be shown than just the modules you  explicitly installed  some modules don’t have dependencies, but in the NPM ecosystem,  those tend to be the exception rather than the rule .  Tip  one very helpful tip i can give is that if you want to see just the top-level  modules, whether in the global or local cache, you can add --depth=0 to the ls  command.  If you want to see what’s installed in global cache instead, you can do  npm -g ls  In fact, keep that -g option in mind because you can add that to most NPM   commands to differentiate between the local and global caches.  You can also update a given module:  npm update express  Just provide the name of the module to update, and NPM will take care of it, updating   to the latest available version. If you don’t provide a package name, then NPM will dutifully  update all packages. And yes, you can drop a -g on it either way to target the global cache.  10   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  You can, of course, uninstall packages too:  npm uninstall express  Execute that and NPM will wipe Express from the local cache, along with its transient   dependencies  so long as nothing else that remains that depends on them .  These few commands represent likely the majority of what you’ll need to interact  with NPM. I refer you to the NPM docs for other commands  and note that just typing  npm and hitting Enter at a command prompt will show you a list of available commands,  and you can then type npm help   to get information about each .   Initializing a New NPM Node Project Now, in all of this, I did skip one step that clearly is optional but is, in fact, typical, and  that’s initializing a new project. With most Node NPM projects, you’ll also have a file  named package.json in the root directory of the project. This file is the project manifest  file, and it provides metadata information to NPM  and Node, at least indirectly  about  your project that it needs to do certain things. It will tell NPM what modules to install if  they haven’t been installed yet for one thing  which makes giving a project to another  developer very easy! . It will also contain information like the name and version of the  project, its main entry point, and lots of other information  most of which is optional, but  we’ll look at that a bit more in the next chapter .  While you can write this file by hand or even go entirely without it, it’s a good idea to   have it, and it’s a good idea to let NPM create it for you, which you can do by executing  this command:  npm init  If you are following along, please make sure the directory you run this from is empty   delete node_modules and package-lock.json if present, both of which will be described  later . This will trigger an interactive process that walks you through the creation of the  package.json file, something like you see in Figure 1-4.  11   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  Figure 1-4.  Initializing a project with NPM  This will walk you through an interactive, step-by-step process wherein you can   enter whichever information is relevant to your project, if any. You can just hit Enter on  each option to use the default  or a blank value, whichever is applicable , or you can  enter the values that are appropriate to you. For our purposes here though, you indeed  can and should simply hit Enter on each prompt in the process.  12   Opening the generated package.json file should look something like this:  Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  {   "name": "temp",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "Init'ing a project",   "main": "test.js",   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"   },   "author": "Frank W. Zammetti",   "license": "ISC" }   Adding Dependencies Now, let’s say you want to add that Express package I mentioned to this project. There  are two choices. First, you could edit package.json yourself, adding this element:  "dependencies": {   "express": "^4.16.1" }  npm install  However, doing just that won’t have any effect. The module isn’t installed at this   point. To do that, you now must issue a command:  NPM will now  using Node as a runtime, it should be mentioned, because NPM is  just a JavaScript application that runs on Node  go fetch the Express package from the  central repository, will determine all the dependencies it needs, and will download  and install all of them in the node_modules directory under the current directory. All  these modules are now in the project cache  not global cache, it should be noted  and  ready for you to use  normally, you wouldn’t use the transient dependencies of Express  directly, though you certainly could, but it’s good form to declare all the modules you  intend to use explicitly in package.json as dependencies .  Another alternative, and the one generally favored by developers, is not to edit the   file directly and instead let NPM do it by issuing a command like this:  npm install express --save  13   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  This will cause NPM to add the dependency entry in package.json for you. This   avoids the possibility of accidentally fat-fingering something and having a broken  experience  or, worse, handing the project to another developer only to get the dreaded  “It won’t even start up!” call .  Note  You can also replace --save with --save-dev. this results in a  devDependencies entry being added to package.json. the difference is  that devDependencies are modules that you only need during development,  but which your project code itself doesn’t depend on. as you’ll see later, two  good examples of this are typeScript and Webpack. also, when uninstalling  dependencies, --save and --save-dev can also be used to remove the  dependency from package.json.  The reason this is all important is that, now, let’s say you want to give this project  to someone else. You typically do not want to provide them with all the dependencies  your project requires, all the content of node_modules, if for no other reason that that  directory can quickly grow to a large size. Instead, they can recreate it using the   package.json file just by doing this:  npm install  That will cause NPM to read the package.json file and automatically install all  the dependencies! Now, the person you’re working with has the same development  environment as you as far as project dependencies go for this project without having to  do any leg work themselves! Pretty sweet, right?  As you can guess, there’s quite a bit more to NPM than just what I’ve shown here, but   these are the real basics.   A Quick Aside: Semantic Versioning The dependencies section also lists the version s  of each dependency, using a  technique called semantic versioning  often called SemVer . SemVer versions are in the  form major.minor.patch.  In this model, changes in the major number are meant to represent an update that   contains breaking changes that would require changes to your code to remediate.    14   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  Changes to the minor number are intended to constitute an update that is backward-  compatible but which provides new functionality and, optionally, contains old  functionality that while still functional is now deprecated and will be removed in a future  release  minor number changes can also represent major internal refactoring but which  produces no outward-facing changes . The patch number represents bug fix changes only.  On top of this, the tilde  ~ , caret  ^ , and asterisk  *  characters have special   meaning. Tilde is used when dealing with patch versions, while caret is used when  dealing with minor versions, and asterisk has the typical “wildcard” meaning you’re  probably familiar with in other contexts.  To give you a very brief overview, here are some of the most common dependency   versions you might see in package.json, using Express as an example:                  “express” : “1.2.3” – NPM will grab this specific version only.  “express”: “~1.2.3” – NPM will grab the most recent patch version.   So, ~1.2.3 will find the latest 1.2.x version but not 1.3.x or anything  below 1.2.x.   “express”: “^1.2.3” – NPM will grab the most recent minor version.   So, ^1.2.3 will find the latest 1.x.x version but not 1.3.x or anything  below 1.x.x.   “express”: “*” – NPM will grab the newest version available.  There is  also an explicit latest value that does the same thing.   There’s quite a lot more to SemVer than this  and there’s also no shortage of criticism   and folks who aren’t exactly fans of it , but this should cover the most common features  you’re likely to encounter. Indeed, this should be all you will need for this book.  Note  When using the npm install   command, you can add   @major.minor.patch after the package name to specify the version to install  using all the Semver rules described in the preceding text.   Fisher Price’s “My First Node Web Server” Now that you know a bit about Node and NPM, the very basics at least, let’s write some  actual code, beyond the simple example shown earlier, that is, and run it with Node.  15   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  When I say that Node makes writing server software trivial, that may well be the   understatement of the year! Perhaps the simplest example  that does something “real,” at  least  is this:  require "http" .createServer  inRequest, inResponse  => {   inResponse.end "Hello from my first Node Web server" ; } .listen 80 ;  That remarkedly small bit of code is all it takes in Node to write a web server. Even   though it’s not necessary, just for practice, go ahead and create a directory and use NPM  to init it as a project  and this time, add a -y to the init command, which will use the  defaults for all the prompts rather than making it interactive . Then, type that code into a  file, save it as server.js. Now, at this point, you could start it up like so:  node server.js  But let’s do one more thing first. Open the generated package.json file, and in the   scripts section, add a new attribute to the object:  "start": "node server.js"  What this does is it effectively defines a custom command for NPM. The start   command is one that already exists, but it’s one that does nothing until you add this  entry in package.json, so it may as well not exist! Once you add that entry though, NPM  will look for that start key, take its value, and execute whatever the command is that  you provide in it. The benefit of doing this is that every project you create with Node  and NPM will be startable the same way. Without this, a developer would need to figure  out what file is the main entry point to launch it with Node  and note that the main key  in package.json may not be enough to tell someone this, as is the case here, since the  default value of index.js would be wrong for this project .  Once you add that, go ahead and start the app:  Yep, that’s it! NPM knows what to do now and will launch Node and tell it to execute   Now fire up your favorite web browser and visit http:  127.0.01. You’ll be greeted  with the text “Hello from my first Node Web server”. Note, however, that if anything else  on your system is already listening on port 80 then the app won’t actually start, you’ll get   npm start  server.js.  16   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  an error instead. In that case, simply change the listen 80  call to a free port and you’ll  be good to go  and, naturally, add the port to the end of the URL in that case too .  If that isn’t a little bit amazing to you, then you’ve probably seen the Flying Spaghetti   Monster  FSM  travel one too many times around your neighborhood and have been  totally desensitized to the amazing!  FSM – yeah, uhh, I’m not gonna even try and  explain what the FSM is; here’s a link: www.venganza.org .  Obviously, this is a simplistic example, but it should get the basic idea across well   enough. But what exactly is going on in that simple example at a code level? As it  happens, quite a bit, and most of it is key to how Node works.  The first concept is the idea of importing modules. In the example code, http is a   module. This is one of the core Node modules that Node comes with out of the box, and,  as such, it is compiled directly into the Node binary. Therefore, you won’t find a separate  JavaScript file for it in the Node installation directory for it. This is true of all the Node  core modules, all of which you can find in the Node documentation on the Node site. To  import any of them, you just require   them by name.  Note  We’ll look at some of the more commonly used modules in the next  chapter.  You can create your own modules too just by adding other .js files to your project   and require  -ing them. This gets a little more involved, with discussions of things like  scope and exports, and we’ll get to all of that in time. But for now, I wanted to mention  it at least in case you really are entirely new to Node so that you can find the appropriate  section in the Node docs to describe this if you want to jump ahead.  The require   function returns an object that is essentially the API provided by the   module. This object can include methods, attributes, or whatever you want. In fact, it  could conceivably be just a variable with some data in an array. More times than not,  though, it will be an object with some methods and attributes. In the case of http in  this example, one of the methods the object returned is createServer  . This method  creates a web server instance and returns a reference to it.  The argument you pass to this method is a function that serves as a request listener;   that is, the function executed any time a request is made to the server.  17   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  This function handles all incoming HTTP request. You can do anything you need to   there, including such things as the following:      Interrogate the incoming request to determine the HTTP method.     Parse the request path.     Examine header values.  You can then perform some branching logic on any or all of these, perhaps access  a database or other durable storage mechanism, and return an appropriate and fully  dynamic response for the specific request.  Creating a web server alone won’t actually do anything. It won’t respond to requests   until you do a little more work. As mentioned, the createServer   method returns a  reference to the web server instance, which itself contains the method listen  . That  method accepts a port number on which the server should listen and, optionally, the  hostname IP address on which to listen. In the example, the standard HTTP port 80 is  specified, and by default, the local machine loopback address 127.0.0.1 is used if no IP  address is specified, as is the case here. Once you call this method, the server will begin  listening for requests  i.e., assuming nothing else is already using that port on your  system! , and for each request that comes in, it will call the anonymous function passed  to createServer  .  This callback function  callback functions being one mechanism by which Node   provides nonblocking functionality, the others being Promises and async await   receives two arguments, inRequest and inResponse, which are objects representing  the HTTP request and response, respectively. In this simple example, all this callback  function does is call the end   method on the response object, passing the response  you want to send back. By default, an HTTP 200 response code header will be added  automatically, so this completes the handling of a given request.  With just this little bit of code, you, in fact, know the basics of what you would   require for writing a server for the MailBag app later! But, when we get to that app, we’ll  use something a little more robust  Express, as mentioned earlier , but this gives you a  fundamental idea of what it takes.   Bonus Example Let’s take this web server code just a little further to roll in some more NPM goodness,  just to use almost everything discussed so far.  18   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  To begin, let’s add a dependency to our project. We’re going to use the not-very-   creatively-but-very-accurately-named request module, which will provide to our server  an elementary HTTP client for it to use to make remote calls:  npm install request --save  With that done, copy that server.js file and name it server_time.js, then replace   its contents with the following code:  require "http" .createServer  inRequest, inResponse  => {   const requestModule = require "request" ;   requestModule      "http:  worldtimeapi.org api timezone America New_York",     function  inErr, inResp, inBody  {       inResponse.end          `Hello from my first Node Web server: ${inBody}`        ;     }    ; } .listen 80 ;  As you probably recognize, it’s the same code as before, but now with a bit more  inside the callback function provided to createServer  . What we’re doing now is  firstly to import the request module and to give it the name requestModule  just to help  disambiguate it from the inRequest object passed into the callback function . The API  for this module is straightforward: pass a URL to the constructor, plus a callback, and  a call will be made to the URL, and the provided callback will be executed when the  response to that call comes back. The URL here is to the World Time API, which you  can read about here: http:  worldtimeapi.org. This particular form of the URL  the  API provides a few  takes in a time zone, America New_York here  though you should  certainly feel free to replace that with a time zone you prefer – you can access http:   worldtimeapi.org api timezone in a browser to see a list of available time zones .  What we get back is a chunk of JSON, which is then written to the response that is  returned to the browser.  19   Chapter 1    Server-Side aCtion: node and npM  The final step is you’ll need to edit package.json to change that start value to  indicate the new JavaScript file, after which you can launch the app and try it. The  response you’ll see now isn’t necessarily pretty:  Hello from my first Node Web server: {"week_number":36,"utc_offset":  "-04:00","utc_datetime":"2019-09-06T17:22:45.406437+00:00","unixtime":  1567790565,"timezone":"America New_York","raw_offset":-18000,"dst_until":  "2019-11-03T06:00:00+00:00","dst_offset":3600,"dst_from":"2019- 03- 10T07:  00:00+00:00","dst":true,"day_of_year":249,"day_of_week":5,"datetime":  "2019-09-06T13:22:45.406437-04:00","client_ip":"12.198.42.69",  "abbreviation":"EDT"}  …but it gets the job done  and, if like me, you have a browser extension that   automatically “prettifies” JSON, then what you’ll see will be, well, prettier! .  This is a good example not only of adding dependencies to a project and using  them but also of the asynchronous nature of Node I talked about earlier. Here, the  call to the World Time API takes some time, and the response to the request coming  from the browser is queued up and awaits that response before executing the callback  passed to the requestModule   constructor, which then produces the final response to  the browser. But, all that time, Node was free to handle other incoming requests; work  wasn’t held up awaiting the remote request, that’s the key thing.   Summary In this chapter, we looked at Node and NPM and discussed the very basics of their  usage. But, because Node and NPM are, conceptually, pretty simple things, these basics  are, by and large, all you need to write real applications. You now know how to execute  JavaScript code, how to create an NPM project, and how to add dependencies. You  understand the difference between the global cache and the local  project  cache, and  you even know how to write a basic web server!  In the next chapter, we’ll continue looking at these two tools in a bit more detail,   getting to some slightly more advanced stuff with them, to expand the foundation from  which we’ll build our two apps later in the book.  20   CHAPTER 2  A Few More Words:  Advanced Node and NPM  In the last chapter, we began looking at Node and NPM, and you even built a quick  Node-based web server to demonstrate the concepts. I said then that you now have the  basics you’d need in both things to start working on some apps. But, before we get to  that, let’s look at them both in just a little more detail.  Since Node got the pole position in the last chapter, let’s flip the script for this one   and give NPM the head start this time out of the gate  yeesh, how many metaphors can  be mixed in one sentence?! .   NPM: More on package.json In the last chapter, you learned how to init a project with NPM, which generates a  package.json file. I said then that most of its contents were optional, and that’s definitely  true, but let’s talk about what’s available in that file, discussing each of the keys available   remember it’s just a JSON file, which means it’s defining a JavaScript object, which has  keys or properties or attributes or even elements – all these terms are generally taken to be  interchangeable in this context :     name – We start with a simple one: the name of the thing you’re   coding! The name element’s value must be no more than 214  characters, cannot start with a dot or an underscore, can have no  uppercase letters, and must be URL-safe.     author – The author is a single person and is defined by an object  with three potential attributes: name, email, and url  where name is  required, and both email and url are optional . Alternatively, you  can make the value a single string in the form "        " and NPM will parse it for you automatically.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_2  21   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM     bin – Some packages require executables to be installed to do their   work and added to the path. That’s where the bin element comes  in. You can make the value an object  or map, which is probably the  more appropriate term here  that maps a command to an executable  and NPM will take care of “installing” it for you when you install the  package by creating the appropriate symlink.     browser – Some modules are meant to be used in a browser, not in  Node, and for those packages, you can use this element instead of  the main element  coming up shortly!  to hint to the users of your  package that it depends on primitives available to JavaScript that  aren’t available in Node.     bugs – If your project has an issue tracker, then you can reference   it with the bugs element. The value of this is an object with two  attributes, url and email, and you can specify either or both  but you  must specify at least one, or NPM will complain .     bundledDependencies – Some projects need to preserve NPM   packages locally or through a single download. For those, this  element allows you to specify an array of package names that will be  bundled with your package when you publish it.              config – If you need to have parameters available in the environment  when your package is used, then the config element might do the  trick. Here, you can specify a value like "config" : { "port" :  "8888" } and then in your code you can reference npm_package_ config_port as an environment variable to get the value configured.  contributors – The contributors element is just like the author element  except that this is an array of people who helped with the project.  cpu – If your code is only meant to run on certain system architectures,  you can specify which as an array of strings with the cpu element.     dependencies – You saw the dependencies element in the previous  chapter, but I’ll also mention that in addition to specifying a package  name and optionally a version to be pulled down from the NPM  registry, you can also specify a URL to a tarball to be downloaded or a  Git GitHub URL or a local file system path.  22   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM     description – A freeform string that describes your package. It’s as   simple as that!     devDependencies – Again, one I mentioned in the previous chapter,  and it’s simply the same as dependencies, but it names packages that  are only needed during development.     directories – This element allows you to describe the structure   your package, things like the location of library components binary  content, man pages, Markdown documentation, examples, and tests.  See the Common JS package specification for details on this.     engines – This element allows you to specify what version s  of Node  your package works on. You can also use this element to define what  version s  of NPM is capable of properly installing the package.  files – When your package is installed as a dependency, NPM will  need to know what files to include. It will by default assume all, but if  you want or need to be specified, then the files element will let you  do that. It works a lot like a .gitignore file, but in reverse: anything  listed in this element will be included, not ignored.     homepage – If your project has a web site, then you can specify the   URL of its homepage with this element.     keywords – The keywords element is an arbitrary array of strings that   can be used to help people find your package  more on this in the  next section .  license – The value of the license element is the license your  package is released under. The value of this must be a currently  registered SPDX license identifier  see spdx.org for a list .  Alternatively, if you are using a custom license or one that doesn’t yet  have an SPDX identifier, then you can set the value to "SEE LICENSE  IN  " and place the   license file alongside the  package.json file. Or, if you don’t grant rights to use your package to  anyone  vis-à-vis, you want to make it private and or unpublished ,  then you can use a value of "UNLICENSED".          23   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM     man – With this element you can specify a single file or an array of  filenames to put in place for the Linux man program to display for  your package.     main – This is the primary entry point to your package. For example,   if your package is named super_duper_cool_package, then a user  will expect to be able to do require "super_duper_cool_package"   after they install it. To allow this, the main element must point to the  file that exports your package’s main export object.     optionalDependencies – If your package has dependencies and   NPM can’t install them, then it will fail the installation of your  package. If, however, you want to specify that some dependencies  are okay to be missing and that NPM should go ahead with the  installation anyway, then optionalDependencies is where you can  list them.     os – Just like cpu, if your package only works on certain OSs, then this   element is where you can have an array of strings naming those it  runs on.     peerDependencies – Sometimes, a package will function as a plugin   to others, and so you’ll need a way to define what other packages  yours is compatible with. The peerDependencies element allows you  to do that.     private – If you want to ensure that you can’t accidentally publish   your package, then set private to false, and NPM will refuse to publish  it  more to come on publishing in the next section .     publishConfig – This element is an object that defines many pieces  of metadata that come into play with publishing your package to the  NPM registry. This includes things like tags and such. This can get  fairly involved, and we won’t  for the most part  be worrying about  any of it in this book beyond a few words in the next section, so I’ll  leave this one to the NPM documentation if and when you need it.      repository – If you’d like to specify where the code for your package  lives, whether GitHub or something else, whether public or private,  the repository element is where you do that.  24   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM          scripts – As mentioned in the previous chapter, the scripts element  allows you to specify a dictionary of commands that can be run at  various points in the lifecycle of your package for various purposes.  Like publishConfig, this can get a bit involved, so I defer to the NPM  docs for details.  version – This is the version of your module, and it must use SemVer  as discussed in Chapter 1. The name and version values together  form a unique “coordinate” to your package, an identifier that  is assumed to be completely unique. If you plan to publish your  package, then name and version are the most important elements  in package.json  if you don’t publish it, then they’re a bit less  important, but for your own sanity, you should probably make them  meaningful anyway! .  You know, I said a few times that I’m deferring to the NPM docs on a few things, but  that’s true of all of those! This isn’t meant to be a reference guide detailing every option;  it’s just meant to be a survey of the elements, so you have a rough idea what’s available.  If and when you need to use these, at least for the ones that aren’t simple, single values,  then the NPM docs at docs.npmjs.com are where you’ll need to visit. There’s a section  dedicated to the contents of package.json that goes over every last detail you could  need or want.   NPM: Other Commands Although you’ve already seen the essential NPM commands, let’s talk about a few more  that you might find yourself needing to use from time to time. As with the previous  section, this is not intended to be an in-depth reference guide, and it’s not a list of every  available NPM command. But, between what was shown in the previous chapter and  what’s in this section, I believe you’ll have exposure to probably 95% of the commands  you’ll need a majority of the time  and there may be one or two more shown as we  progress in later chapters as well .  25    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  Chapter 2   Auditing Package Security The sad reality is that, sometimes, packages you use will be discovered to have security  vulnerabilities, just like any other software you use. But, being aware of this, the NPM  team has constructed a useful command for dealing with this:  Running this command will scan your package.json file  or global packages if you   use -g  and submit the list of dependencies to the default NPM registry requesting a  report on any known vulnerabilities in them. This report will also include information on  how to remediate. But, if you want the quick answer, execute this command:  npm audit  npm audit fix  That will cause NPM to update any vulnerable packages with the newest available   version that hasn’t had the vulnerability reported in it. If you’d like to see a detailed audit report, execute  Finally, if you’d like to see what npm audit fix would do but without literally doing    Deduplication and Pruning One of the complaints you’ll commonly see about NPM and Node is that the size of the  node_modules directory can balloon in a hurry. Fortunately, you rarely will need to dive  into it, but it’s still a question of disk space, and while disk space is cheap these days, it’s  still not chic to be wasteful!  NPM provides two commands for dealing with this situation, starting with  npm audit --json  or, if you prefer plain text  npm audit --readable  it, you can use  npm audit fix --dry-run  npm dedup  26   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  The dedup command searches through the tree of packages in node_modules and   looks for opportunities where packages can be moved up the tree and shared between  dependencies, thereby reducing redundancy and saving space. The package tree is built  up as you install packages and as NPM installs the packages, it depends on, and so on.  Sometimes, packages will have dependencies in common, but being a tree, branches   read: packages  are mostly independent. This command attempts to reorganize those  branches to make it more efficient.  The second command is this:  npm prune  This command will examine the installed packages and look for any that may no   longer be needed. This typically happens when you uninstall packages and especially if  you’ve done a dedup at some point. Any package that is not listed in the parent package’s  dependency list is considered “extraneous” and therefore subject to being pruned.  In regular operation, prune will be run automatically any time you install   Note  something, so you shouldn’t need to run this manually, but sometimes, as the  saying goes, poo happens, so it’s good to know about it anyway.   Finding Searching for Packages sans Browser It’s easy enough to browse the central NPM registry for packages of interest via a web  browser, but it’s not your only choice. NPM itself provides a search capability, an  example of which you can see in Figure 2-1.  Figure 2-1.  A simple NPM search for “express”  27   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  You can use the search command in a few ways, but searching via description   like this is perhaps the most common. In fact, this search will examine all metadata  for packages, not just the description, which is why you see some name and keyword  matches highlighted as well.   Updating Packages Once you have a project set up, you may on occasion want to update the packages it  depends on. This is very easy to do:  npm update  Yep, that’s it! NPM will go off and update all packages to the latest version, respecting   your SemVer settings. You naturally can stick a -g in there too in order to update global  packages.   Publishing Unpublishing Packages The final NPM topic I want to touch on is publishing  and optionally unpublishing   packages, usually to the central NPM registry  though nothing says you can’t have your  own private registry to work with .  Publishing to a registry is quite easy! First, you’ll need to, well, write your package!   Gotta have something to publish, right? You don’t need to do anything special, but npm  init your project and cobble your code together.  Once that’s done, create an account on the registry’s web site. Next, you’ll need to log   into that account from the command line:  npm login  logged in, publishing is a snap:  npm publish  This will prompt you for your username, password, and eMail address. Once you’re   As long as you’re in your package’s root directory  the one you ran npm init in and   that now has your package.json file , it will be published.  28   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  Well, hold up, there’s one thing that can go wrong: your package name could already   be taken. It’s always a good idea to do an npm search for the name first, but assuming  the name isn’t taken  or you’ve changed it after discovering a collision , then it’ll be  published and available in the registry immediately.  If the name you really want isn’t available, npM also lets you publish to a scope.   Tip  this means, for example, you can change the name to @  <package- name>  or do npm init --scope=  . You’ll then also need to add  --access public to the publish command. that way, as long as your package  name is unique within the scope, then you’re good to go; the name can be used in  other scopes without issue  and no scope is effectively the default scope! . so, if, like  domain names, the one you want is taken, there’s a way around it in npM land.  If you for some reason down the line decide you need to remove your package from   the registry, it’s as simple as  npm unpublish [  ] [@ ]  If you don’t specify a version, then all versions will be removed. Two important notes here: First, removing a package is generally considered bad  form because others may be depending on it. The better thing to do is to use another  command: deprecate. That will mark your package as deprecated, optionally applying  a message you can specify about what happens. Second, it’s essential to understand that  even if you unpublish a package, the name and or name-plus-version combination can  never be reused. So again, if you want to be a good citizen, it’s best not to unpublish but  instead deprecate the package  better still not to publish something you later have to  remove or deprecate – but it happens, so NPM has you covered in either case with these  two commands .   Node: Standard Modules Now that we’ve given NPM its due, let’s swing back to the Node side. Here, we’ll take  a look at some of the modules that come with Node and that you can use at any time  without having to install anything else. Again, let me say that this is in no way meant to  be an exhaustive look at everything available. There are many more modules available,   29   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  and you definitely should take a look at the Node documentation to see what they are.  I’m just going to give you a quick overview of what, from my experience, will be the ones  you’ll likely use most often and then only briefly.   File System  fs  The File System module is one of the more often-used modules available. It provides you  an API for working with the local file system in a pattern that closely matches that of the  standard POSIX functions.  To use this module, you’ll need to require   it:  const fs = require "fs" ;  This, in fact, is necessary for all but one of the modules described here  and it’s true  for most of the modules you’ll find in the Node documentation . That’s what the string  in parenthesis after each title is: it’s the value you need to require    you can, of course,  assign it to a variable of whatever name you wish, though I tend to make the variable  name and the require   value the same .  Now that we have the module imported, what can we do with it? Well, here’s some of   what I think are the handier bits of functionality this module offers:      fs.copyFile   – As you would guess, it allows you to copy a file. You  supply to it the source file to copy, and the destination location where  to put it and Node will send the request to the underlying operating  system to perform. Note that as is the case with most of Node, this  call will be asynchronous. Therefore, it allows you to pass it a callback  function to execute once the copy completes. Alternatively, there is  a fs.copyFileSync   method that is synchronous and so will block  your code until the operation completes. This pattern, of passing  a callback or offering a synchronous version of the function, is a  pattern repeated in much of this module and even other modules  when asynchronous operations come up, so keep that in mind as  we proceed, though I won’t mention it again. To be clear, it’s not  something you’ll find available in every case, but in many, perhaps  even most.  30   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM                      fs.readFile   – Yep, it reads a file and passes the data from it to a  function you supply, wherein you can do whatever you like with it.  And yes, there is, of course, a matching fs.writeFile   method,  with which you can do things like writing a JavaScript object that you  JSON.stringify   to marshal into a string to a file.  fs.unlink   – If you want to delete a file, you actually want to  “unlink” it in POSIX-speak, so this module offers an fs.unlink    method. Pass it the path to the file, and thy bidding will be done!    You can also remove symlinks with this.   fs.mkdir   – Not only can you work with files with this module but  you can work with directories too. The fs.mkdir   method allows  you to create directories. I should also note at this point that all  the methods so far also accept an object with various options. For  example, this method allows you to pass a mode key in the options  object to specify the permissions for the directory  although note  that this is not supported on Windows . This is a typical pattern that  repeats itself frequently in this module as well. To delete a directory,  the fs.rmdir   method is provided.  fs.stat   – If you’re looking for information about a file or directory,  things like its size, last access time, and when it was created, then  fs.stat   is your friend. It returns an fs.Stats object, which is an  object within the File System module, and it contains many pieces  of information including the size of the file or directory  size  and  when it was created  birthtime .  fs.readdir   – This method allows you to read in the contents of a  directory given its path, and returns to you an array of filenames, or  an array of Buffer objects containing the names, or an array of   fs.Dirent objects, one per file  which you get depends on the options  you pass in, with an array of string filenames being the default .  In later versions of Node, starting around v10, a new subsection of the File System   module was introduced: the Promises API. Basically, it provides methods matching  the fs methods seen here and most of the others this module offers, but that return   31   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  Promises. So, if you prefer a Promise-based coding style  or async await on top of that ,  then have a look at the section on that in the docs. Other than different names  e.g., fs. fsPromises.copyFile   and fs.fsPromises.readFile    and the obvious syntactic  differences, they otherwise are mostly the same as the non-Promise versions.   HTTP and HTTPS  http and https  Although Node isn’t exclusively for writing servers, whether web servers or other kinds  of servers, it is, in fact, best known for writing web servers  or, to be more precise, HTTP  servers . As such, you’d reasonably expect to find one or more modules related to such  activities, and you would be very right to do so!  The HTTP module is where you’ll find most of what you need to write servers that   use the HTTP protocol. If you’re into the whole security thing  and, uhh, you are into the  whole security thing…right?! , then there is also an HTTPS module.  You already saw the http.Server class, if only briefly, in the last chapter, because  it’s what you get back from the http.createServer   method, which is one method  available in the HTTP package. You saw how to call the listen   method on that   http.Server instance, but you can also find out if the instance is listening by  interrogating its listen property  a simple boolean . You can also call the close    method on the instance to stop it from accepting requests. You can call setTimeout   on  it to set how long a socket to a client lives for  two minutes by default  and you can set  the maxHeadersCount property to limit how many HTTP headers your server will accept   defaults to 2000 .  The HTTPS module builds on top of the HTTP module and provides the ability to   create servers that use TLS to secure connections. The only real difference is some extra  information about certificates and keys that you must provide when constructing the  server:  const fs = require "fs" ; const server = require "https" .createServer    {     key : fs.readFileSync "my_key.pem" ,     cert : fs.readFileSync "my_cert.pem"    },  32   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM     inRequest, inResponse  => {   inResponse.writeHead 200 ;   inResponse.end "I am protected by TLS!" ; } .listen 443 ;  Aside from that, the API available is virtually identical. But the HTTP and HTTPS modules aren’t just about servers: they also provide the   means for your Node-based code to make HTTP requests! Here is an example, using the  http.request   method:  let finalResponse = "";  const request = require "http" .request    {     hostname : "www.some_remote_system.com",     port : 80,     path : " someAPI",     method : "POST"   },    inResponse  => {     console.log `STATUS: ${inResponse.statusCode}` ;     inResponse.setEncoding "utf8" ;     inResponse.on "data",  inDataChunk  => {       finalResponse += inDataChunk.     } ;     inResponse.on "end",    => {       console.log finalResponse ;     } ;   }  ;  request.write "Some data to send to the remote system" ; request.end  ;  33   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  Here, we build up an http.Request object, providing to it all the pertinent   connection details in the first object passed to the http.request   method. Then, we  send some arbitrary data string to the remote server and build up a response string.  The on event fires every time the server sends back a chunk of data, so we add it to  the finalResponse string, which is displayed when the end event fires, signifying the  complete response has been received. We are, of course, free to do whatever we wish  with the response at that point.   OS  os  The OS module provides a set of operating system–level utility functions that allow your  code to be aware of the environment it’s running in and make any necessary allowances  for it. Some of what it offers include the following:                          os.EOL – Provides you the end-of-line character the operating system  uses  os.cpus   – Returns an object array where each object gives you  information about the CPU s  in the system including information  like their model, speed, and times  e.g., how long the CPU has spent  in user mode   os.freemem   – Returns an integer value that is the number of free  system memory available in bytes  os.homedir   – Returns a path to the current home directory of the  user running the process  os.hostname   – Returns the machine’s host name  os.tempdir   – Returns a path to the default system temporary  directory  You’ll also find an os.constants property that is an object with several keys, things   like SIGHUP, SIGFPE, SIGCHILD, and SIGSTOP. These are commonly used OS-specific  constants for things like error codes and, as in these examples, process signals. These  will, of course, change from system to system to at least some extent, but it’s good to  know such a collection of information like this exists and is made available to you thanks  to the OS module!  34   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM   Path  path  You’ll notice that in several modules discussed thus far, you need to reference file and  directory paths. Node provides some additional functions for working with them housed  in the Path module.  For example, the path.basename   method returns the last portion of a path:  path.basename " my path index.htm" ;    "index.html"  By contrast, if you want just the path portion:  path.dirname " my path index.htm" ;    " some path"  And if you just want the extension:  path.extname " my path index.htm" ;    ".htm"  those do, plus a bit more:  path.parse " home users mydata accounts.dat" ;  This will return you an object in the form:  Finally, the path.parse   method is handy for, in a way, doing in one call what all of   { root : " ", dir : " home users mydata",   base : "accounts.dat", ext : ".dat", name : "accounts" }  If you need to know the platform-specific path delimiter  ; for windows and : for ∗nix   systems , then you can get the value from the path.delimiter property.  Then there is the path.join   method which joins path segments into a final form   that uses the platform-specific separator automatically  this example is on a Windows  system :  path.join " my", "path", "index.htm" ;    "my\path\index.htm"  Because it is common to have to build paths dynamically in code, and because that   process can result in munged string easily, Node offers a helpful method to deal with  such issues in the path.normalize   method:  path.normalize "C:    tmp\\ \\ dat.md"     "C:\\temp\\dat.md"  35   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  Here, assume that some logic produced the string passed to path.normalize  , and  that logic has to take a lot of things into account, so it can wind up with some sequences  as you see that need to be reduced down to platform-specific and valid sequences. That’s  what path.normalize   can do for you.   Process Unlike the other modules, this one is a global, which means it is always available, and  there is no need to import anything. You simply call methods on the intrinsic process  reference or access its properties.  That, of course, is good to know, but what does this module do for us? Well, the  answer is quite a lot! In short, it allows you to retrieve information and control the  current Node process. Here are just a few of the items it offers:                  process.abort   – This method aborts the Node process, ending  your program. However, that unceremoniously kills the process, so  what you likely want to use is process.exit   instead, to which you  can pass an exit code to return to the process that started Node.  process.version – This contains the version of Node itself.  process.uptime   – How long has the Node process been running  for? This method will tell you!  process.mainModule – Here, you can find the name of the .js file  that was launched by Node. Note that Node also provides a handful  of global variables that contain important information like this,  __filename being the equivalent to this property  they generally all  start with two underscores like that . For reference, __dirname will  provide the name of the directory where the script was launched  from, which tends to be an often-needed piece of information.      process.env – This contains an object whose keys are user  environment variables.  There’s quite a bit more that the process module offers, but in my experience, much   beyond these is a bit more unusual to use, so I’ll leave its exploration as an exercise for  the reader.  36   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM   Query Strings  querystring  When building HTTP S  servers with Node, having to examine the query string is  commonly needed  I mean that’s not limited to just Node of course: dealing with query  strings, either parsing them or creating them, is a big part of what web developers do! .  The Query String module offers a handful of methods for such times.  When talking about query strings on the input side of the fence, querystring.parse     is the primary tool in your toolbox  assume this code is within a server event handler as  you’ve previously seen, and the URL in the comment is the request that came in :     "http:  mysite.com ?account=36764&add=125"; let parsedURL = url.parse request.url ; let parsedParams = querystring.parse parsedURL ;  Now, you’re getting a bonus look-ahead here to the next module we’ll be checking   out: URL. The url.parse   method takes in a URL and returns an object like so:  {     protocol: 'http:',     slashes: true,     auth: null,     host: 'mysite.com',     port: null,     hostname: 'mysite.com',     hash: null,     search: '?account=36764&add=125',     query: 'account=36764&add=125',     pathname: ' ',     path: ' ?account=36764&add=125',     href: 'http:  mysite.com ?account=36764&add=125' }  All by itself, that’s useful, but if all we’re interested in are those query parameters   account and add, then that’s where the querystring.parse   method comes in. What  you get back from that is an object:  { account : "36764", add : "125" }  37   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  From there out, you can do whatever you like with the data. Note that there is also a   querystring.decode  , which is just an alias for querystring.parse  .  What about if you need to construct a query string? Well, that’s where the   querystring.stringify   method  and its querystring.encode   alias  fit in:  const qs = querystring.stringify {   account : 36764, add : 125 } ;    Returns "account=36764&add=125"  Finally, there are the querystring.escape   and querystring.unescape     methods, which are the yin and yang of encoding and decoding parameter names and  values in query strings so that they are safe for inclusion in URLs. Note that you typically  wouldn’t call these directly as they’re used by querystring.parse   and querystring. stringify   internally and automatically, but they are there if you need them.  Well, how about that. This is the first  and only  module where everything it offers is   described here! It’s not a big module, but it’s a somewhat important one!   URL  url  In the previous section, you saw the url.parse   method used, and that’s just one thing  the URL module offers. Some others are as follows:          URL – Okay, this is going to sound weird, but the URL module   exposes the URL class, and the URL class is where a large chunk of   the functionality of this module resides. For example, the   url.URL.hash property returns the fragment portion of a URL    e.g., new url.URL "http:  mysite.com page.htmlsectionA" . hash will have the value sectionA . Similarly, you can get the host  which  will include the port, if specified , the hostname  which will not include the  port , the username and password portion of a URL  if specified , and the  port or protocol, in the same way, all properties of a URL instance.  url.pathToFileURL   and url.fileURLToPath   – Respectively, these  methods ensure that a path is resolved absolutely and that the URL  control characters are correctly encoded when converting into a file  URL and that correct decoding of percent-encoded characters in a file  URL is done while ensuring the result is a valid cross-platform path.  38   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM   Utilities  util  The final module we’re going to look at briefly is a little bit of a catch-all, or maybe it’s  better to say it contains functions that support Node internally, but which also provides  generic JavaScript functionality that might be useful to application code.  For example, if you want to format a string using a printf-like format, you can do  util.format "%s:%s", "aa", "bb", "cc"     "aa:bb cc"  What if you have an asynchronous function, like fs.stat   let’s say, that uses the   common pattern seen in Node where the callback receives an error object first and  then a value object and you want to make it use Promises, but you don’t want to have to  rewrite the code? Well, then there’s this:  const newStat = util.promisify fs.stat ;  Now, you can call it like so:  newStat " home fzammetti"  .then  inStats  => { console.log inStats ; }  .catch  inError  => { console.log inError ; } ;  Nice, right? Do you have a variable and need to know its type? Then Utilities has you covered:   util.types.isArrayBuffer  , util.types.isBigInt64Array  , util.types. isBooleanObject  , util.types.isDate  , util.types.isMap  , util.types. isPromise  , and util.types.isUint32Array   are available just to name a few.  Finally, the util.inspect   method can be used to get a string representation of an  object intended for debugging purposes. This method accepts a whole bunch of options,  including being able to specify whether you want to show hidden fields, how far down  into the object to go if it contains nested objects  depth  and if you wish to sort the keys  in the stringified object that is returned. It’s important to note though that this method’s  documentation states that the representation this produces can change at any time, so  you, therefore, should never try to use this programmatically. Printing the string to the  console is fine, but trying to parse it wouldn’t be a great idea lest you find your code  randomly broke at some point in the future after a Node upgrade.  39    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM  Chapter 2   The Rest of the Cast As of this writing, the other modules Node provides, which we won’t be looking at in  detail but which I wanted to at least make you aware of, are as follows:     Assertion Testing – The Assert module provides a simple set of   assertion tests that can be used to test invariants.     Async Hooks – The async_hooks module provides an API to register   callbacks tracking the lifetime of asynchronous resources created  inside a Node application.     Buffer – This is, in fact, a class, not a module, and as such, it's in   global scope. Either way, it's a class created before JavaScript offered  the TypedArray that provides the ability to work with streams of  binary data.     C++ Addons – Node addons are dynamically linked shared objects,   written in C++, that can be loaded into Node using the require    function and used just as if they were an ordinary Node module. They  are mainly used to provide an interface between JavaScript running  in Node and C C++ libraries. This module allows you to work with  them. The N-API module goes along with this and enables you to  build them.     Child Processes – The child_process module provides the ability to   spawn child processes outside of Node.     Cluster – A single instance of Node runs in a single thread. To take  advantage of multi-core systems, the user will sometimes want to  launch a group of Node processes to handle the load. The cluster  module allows easy creation of child processes that all share server  ports.     Console – The console module provides a simple debugging console   that is like the JavaScript console mechanism provided by web  browsers.     Crypto – The crypto module provides cryptographic functionality  that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher,  decipher, sign, and verify functions.  40   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM     DNS – The dns module contains functions belonging to two different   categories: methods that use the underlying operating system  facilities to perform name resolution and methods that connect to an  actual DNS server to achieve name resolution.     HTTP 2 – The http2 module provides an implementation of the   HTTP 2 protocol. It’s just like http and https, but newer and better!      Inspector – The inspector module provides an API for interacting  with the V8 inspector.     Net – The net module provides an asynchronous network API for   creating stream-based TCP or IPC servers and clients.     Performance Hooks – The Performance Timing API, by way of   the perf_hooks module, provides an implementation of the W3C  Performance Timeline specification. The purpose of the API is to  support the collection of high-resolution performance metrics.  This is the same Performance API as implemented in modern web  browsers.     Readline – The readline module provides an interface for reading  data from a readable stream  such as process.stdin  one line at a  time.     REPL – The repl module provides a Read-Eval-Print-Loop  REPL    implementation that is available both as a stand-alone program and  includible in other applications.     Stream – A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming   data in Node assertion testing.     String Decoder – The string_decoder module provides an API for   decoding Buffer objects into strings in a manner that preserves  encoded multi-byte UTF-8 and UTF-16 characters.     Timers – The timer module exposes a global API for scheduling   functions to be called at some later time.     TLS SSL – The tls module provides an implementation of the  Transport Layer Security  TLS  and Secure Socket Layer  SSL   protocols that are built on top of OpenSSL.  41   Chapter 2    a Few More words: advanCed node and npM     TTY – The tty module provides the tty.ReadStream and    tty.WriteStream classes and deals with reading and writing output  and input to the terminal.     UDP Datagram – The dgram module provides an implementation of      V8 – The v8 module exposes APIs that are specific to the version of V8   UDP Datagram sockets.  built into the Node binary.     VM – The vm module provides APIs for compiling and running code   within V8 virtual machine contexts.     Worker Threads – The worker module provides a way to create  multiple environments running on independent threads and to  create message channels between them.     Zlib – The zlib module provides compression functionality   implemented using Gzip and Deflate Inflate, as well as Broutil.  Note  there are a few modules listed in the node documentation, but I did not  include any here that were marked for deprecation.   Summary In this chapter, we delved into just a little more detail on Node and NPM, talking about  package.json in more detail, some other NPM commands you might need, and we took  a look at the standard libraries that ship with Node, at least those that I believe most  developers would find of most significant interest.  In the next chapter, we’ll look at the next technology we’ll need to build the two   coming apps: React.  42   CHAPTER 3  Client-Side Adventures:  React  In the previous two chapters, we talked about Node and its good friend NPM, two of the  most popular tools for building server-side applications. Now, let’s look at the client side  of the fence.  The big joke – which is less a joke and more an observation really – is that there   seems to be a new framework library toolkit for building web-based client applications  every day. That is both the benefit and the curse of having such a vibrant development  community! But, over the last couple of years, a few popular options have floated to the  top of the pile and React is one of them. That’s what we’re going to look at in this chapter  and the next.   A Brief History of React React  the logo for which you can see in Figure 3-1 because why not? , which is  sometimes referred to as React.js or ReactJS  but I’ll stick with React because, like the  Dude, I’m into the whole brevity thing , is a product of everyone’s favorite  or the exact  opposite of favorite – there seems to be no middle ground  company: Facebook. React, in  simplest terms, is a library for building web-based user interfaces.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_3  43   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  Figure 3-1.  The React logo in all its React-y glory!  It all started back in around 2010 when Facebook developers who, despite any   feelings about the company you may have, are quite talented began to run into a lot of  issues with code maintenance. That’s nothing unusual in the modern web development  world: especially when building Single-Page Apps  SPAs , it’s easy to make a massive  mess of things if you don’t have robust architecture and disciplined adherence to it.  As you bring more developers onto the team, doing that becomes exponentially more  difficult.  Facebook faced this issue and found that their development velocity was slowing   down immensely and their delivered quality was suffering for it, all of which are bad for a  company trying to make a buck.  In 2010, the engineers introduced XHP into their PHP stack. XHP is an extension to  PHP that augments the syntax and, so the argument goes at least, makes your PHP code  easier to read. Perhaps the most significant thing it provides is the notion of composite  components, which allows for an interface to be broken down into mostly independent  but easily integrated units of functionality.  Then, in 2011, the first notion of what would become React emerged in large part   based on some of the core concepts of XHP: FaxJs. This was a project created by an  engineer by the name of Jordan Walke. FaxJs had several critical characteristics we now  see in React, including the following:  44   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt     Views are automatically updated any time their state changes. This   is termed a reactive interface, and it essentially means that when  the data the interface deals with changes, the interface will update  appropriately to reflect it, all without the developer having to write  code to do so explicitly.     High performance is a key consideration right from the start. While   FaxJs achieved this in large part thanks to a string concatenation  approach, React instead uses something a little more robust: virtual  DOM. I’ll come back to this in the next section.     Perhaps most importantly, FaxJs at a high level was based on the   notion of components. Everything you did was a component, and then  you composed these components into the interface seen by the user.  Possibly the big turning point in the history of React was in 2012 when Facebook  started running into a lot of problems managing the ads displayed on the site. Since  ads usually are served by someone else’s server and you aren’t in complete control of  what they are, it’s easy for them to break your site. So, the engineers at Facebook started  looking for a solution, and FaxJs jumped out at them.  At that point, Jordan Walke started working on an initial prototype and, before long,   React emerged.  But just creating React and even using it internally wouldn’t have changed the  world even if it helped Facebook tremendously. No, something else had to happen,  and that something else was in April of 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram. This  was important because Instagram wanted to use React, but at that point the library was  tightly coupled, relatively speaking, to Facebook’s site itself and its code. And, of course,  it was entirely internal for Facebook and maintained by, for the most part, one  brilliant   person. No, if Facebook was going to let others, even a new acquisition, start to use  React, they would have to open source it, and they would have to build a community  around it to continue driving the ball down the field.  The primary driving force of this shift was a guy named Pete Hunt. Pete, along with  Jordan, got React open sourced in May of 2013. Interestingly, at its initial release, there  was a lot of skepticism about React and many people, for various reasons, saw it as a bit  of a step backward. It didn’t take long, however, for the momentum to shift as people got  a better look and some experience with it, and by the end of 2013, things were looking a  lot better for React.  45   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  During 2014, several things occurred to shift the currents in React’s favor. For   example, React Developer Tools were released as an extension of Chrome Developer  Tools, giving React developers a robust development toolset to use to develop and debug  their React apps. A significant number of conferences and meetups were held to expand  exposure to React. Many editors and IDEs begin to introduce native support for React.  All of this began to take React mainstream.  2015 and 2016 are when it really started to go mainstream. Flipboard, Netflix, and   Airbnb all using React most definitely helped a lot. Many more conferences and the  release of more robust React tooling did too.  Since the end of 2017, React has continued to grow and is now one of, if not the, most   popular library for building client-side web applications.  Note  i keep emphasizing the client-side nature of react, and that’s primarily  because that’s how we’re going to use it in this book. But it’s worth noting that  react can also render content on the server side. that’s a whole other topic of  conversation that i won’t be covering in this book, but i wanted to make you aware  of it. Should you wish to Google for it, the somewhat obvious term applied to this  is Server-Side rendering, or SSr. it’s not exclusive to react, but react makes it  considerably better.   Yeah, Okay, History Nerd, That’s All Great, but What  IS React?! You might actually be surprised to see how little there fundamentally is to React. It  doesn’t ship with a bunch of interface widgets like grids and buttons and sliders and  such as many more “robust” toolkits do. It doesn’t provide a rigid structure to your  application like many frameworks do.  At a very high level, the point of React is to make it easy to reason about the   structure of your interface at any given moment in time. This is accomplished by way of  components, which you can think of as self-contained pieces of the interface. Combine a  whole bunch of widgets and you have yourself a user interface.  46   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  Getting into a little more detail, but still in possibly simplest terms, React supplies   just four things: the aforementioned components  more precisely, an approach for  building them , props, state, and style  some might argue this fourth shouldn’t be  included since it’s outside React itself, but I think it’s reasonable to include it .  Well, you might consider there to be a fifth thing too, given that it’s so fundamental to   React, and that’s virtual DOM.  You won’t be using virtual DOM directly, but React will be using it extensively.   Presumably, you know what the regular DOM is, but if not, it’s the Document Object  Model, which is to say the tree structure that the browser builds as it parses your  HTML. All the elements, denoted by tags, in the HTML, become nodes in this tree.  Typically, when you do something that makes a change to the page, whether it be as  a result of user action or programmatically, the browser has to perform some relatively  intensive and expensive work, primarily to repaint the screen  any change that doesn’t  affect the flow of the page falls in this category, things like changing the color of text  and  reflow  any changes that can affect the layout, say, inserting a new   element . This  DOM, therefore, has a direct tie to what you see on the screen, and it offers an API to  manipulate it with. All of this takes computing time obviously, and sometimes a lot of   it – enough to impact the user experience.  So React uses the concept of a virtual DOM. This is, in essence, a secondary DOM   that sits conceptually on top of the real DOM in memory. Rather than manipulate  the real DOM directly, you instead allow React to mediate the changes that could  occur to the page. React will update the virtual DOM and then will intelligently figure  out, via a diffing algorithm, the least amount of real DOM work that can be done to  accomplish the update. Most importantly, this allows React to batch up real DOM  changes and apply them all in one go, which is much more efficient than doing each  one individually. The result is better performance than can typically be achieved with  direct DOM manipulation  there’s always exceptions, but this tends to be generally  true .  Putting virtual DOM aside, since it’s in a sense just an internal React implementation   detail, let’s talk about each of the other four in turn, and in the process, let’s build  ourselves an elementary React app to see it all in action!  47    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  Chapter 3   The Real Star of the Show: Components Let’s start things off by creating ourselves a plain old HTML document, like that shown in  Listing 3-1.  Listing 3-1.  A basic HTML document to start building our simple React app with   if you don’t understand this already, then, Houston, we have a problem!                      Intro To React                 Yep, that ain’t exactly rocket science! Now, to it, let’s add two lines into the   of the document to bring React into the        <script crossorigin src="https:  unpkg.com react-dom@16 umd react-dom. development.js">   Here, I’m using a CDN to download the main React code  react.development.js  as  well as the react-dom package, which you can think of as the bridge between React itself  and the browser’s DOM. React can talk to different renderers, which are the bits of code  that produce the visual output. It might be possible to have a renderer that produces,  say, bitmap images for display in a desktop operating system, allowing you to write  desktop apps with React. The react-dom package is that but targeting the browser DOM  and HTML. Note that for both, I’m specifying the development builds rather than the  production builds, which are also available. This aids in debugging during development  since the code isn’t’ minified and munged and whatnot.  fold:  48   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  Note  For performance, it would usually be better to move the two react imports  to the bottom of the document, as well as the code in start   , and not call it onload.  that’s page optimization 101. i did it this way because i think it’s slightly easier to  grasp what’s happening in a more deterministic fashion, and in this example the  page will load fast enough that the difference won’t matter much anyway.  If you reload the page at this point, nothing will happen, because we’re not using   React yet. React will just happily sit there in the background not bugging us! So, now, let’s  introduce some React action, as shown in Listing 3-2.  Listing 3-2.  Our first usage of React!

Keep this warning in mind as you look at the code throughout   50   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  this book since i can’t know for sure who will hit this problem and who won’t    i ran into it, but my technical reviewer apparently didn’t, e.g., it seems to depend  on various factors local to each machine, so i’m just throwing this out there as a  general warning in case it comes up, but hopefully it won’t for you! .  This will result in the screen shown in Figure 3-2. It’s nothing complex, but it gets the   point across pretty well.  Figure 3-2.  Our first React app gets its close-up!  Okay, so what’s going on here?! To start, we have a function start   called when the  page loads. This function uses what is probably one of the most important things React  offers, the React.createElement   method. The method signature for it is  React.createElement type, {props}, ...children ;  This method will construct a new React element, which is the smallest building block   of the visual interface of a React app. These are plain old JavaScript objects and thus are  cheap and fast to create, as compared to DOM nodes. React will take care of updating the  DOM to match all the elements that are a part of that virtual DOM  creating real DOM  nodes from the elements and inserting them as appropriate essentially .  It should be noted that, typically, you’ll be working with React components.   Components are composed of elements, that’s the difference. The type you specify  here can be a tag name, as shown here, or it can be a React component type, or a React  fragment, which allows you to create multiple nested elements at once.  51   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  In this start   function, React.createElement   is used to build up a tree of   elements, all of which are children of the top-level div element that the variable  rootElement holds a reference to. Each call to React.createElement   after that first  one is creating a child of the element above it in the tree. Then, when that tree is built up,  the ReactDOM.render   method is called, passing it a reference to that top-level element  as well as a real DOM node to render it to. The ReactDOM.render   method takes that  built-up virtual DOM tree and renders it to the real DOM, and voila, we have stuff on the  screen!  Now, if at this point, you’re probably thinking “wow, React is verbose and looks   annoying to write” and well, I would agree with you! However, what you’re going to find  in the next chapter is that people usually don’t write React apps like this. Instead, they  use something called JSX, and that makes it considerably easier to write React apps  with. We’ll get into that in the next chapter, but the key thing though is that when you  write a React app with JSX, under the covers, it will produce code similar to this, so I  think it makes a lot of sense to understand how React is doing things in the end. Plus,  there may be a reason specifically you want to write your apps this way, one of which is  when you want to add some React components to an existing app. In such a case, you’re  likely not going to rewrite the whole thing in JSX. You’ll more likely just want to insert  some components somewhere onto your existing page. With code like this, you can do  precisely that.  But I glossed over a few things here. One of which, props, I’m going to get into more   in the next section, but you can start to get a sense of what they’re about in the line:  React.createElement "a",   { href : "https:  www.etherient.com" },   "The home page of Etherient"    It doesn’t take much to figure out that props are how you pass data into an element    or component, as it happens . But there’s a bit more to it than that, so let’s come back to  that in the next section.  One thing that you should realize here is that we really haven’t dealt with   components at all, and, hey, that’s the title of this section! I’ve also said that components  are really the foundation of React, so let’s remedy having not seen them yet by rewriting  the code a bit, as shown in Listing 3-3.  52   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  Listing 3-3.  Finally, some of those components he’s been on about!

React components have several characteristics that you’ll see  throughout this book, but perhaps the most important is a render   method. Without  that, it won’t be much of a component! The render   method, which is the only thing your  component is required to contain, is responsible for returning one of several things:   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt     A portal  a more advanced topic that won’t be covered in this book      A string or a number  these are rendered as plain text nodes in the   DOM      A boolean or null  results in nothing being rendered   Of these, the first two are almost always going to be what you return. You would think  that arrays or fragments would be common too, but it’s more common to return a single  component or element that itself has children, which accomplishes much the same goal.  You can also now see the other side of props, meaning how you use them within  a component. The this.props member will be present on any component thanks to  React, and React populates it for you when you use the component using whatever you  pass as the second argument to React.createElement  , and you can use the data in  props as appropriate inside the component. Here, it’s just rendering the three props   title, href, and description  as part of the elements returned.  Speaking of using a component, you can see that being done in the rootElement   definition. This time, we call React.createElement   but now we pass it the name of the  React component as the first argument, React instantiates that component for us, passes  the props to it, and whatever that component’s render   method returns effectively is  inserted at that point in the tree.  Hopefully, you can start to see some of the benefits of this componentized approach.   Now, you can avoid having a bunch of redundant React.createElement   calls and  instead encapsulate it inside a component and reuse the component wherever you need  a Bookmark to appear. There are no real rules about how you break the interface down;  I could have created a custom component to encapsulate the   elements and maybe  called it a BookmarkGroup component. Whatever makes sense to you is the answer.   Components Need Info: Props As you saw in the previous section, props, which is short for properties, is how  information is passed into components. For the simple HTML elements created earlier,  that can be the attributes of those elements that you’re familiar with: href for a link or the  text inside an   element  the text isn’t technically an attribute of the   tag itself, it’s  actually a text node nested inside the  , but at least in practice it’s the same thing .  For custom components, you get to define whatever props it needs. For the Bookmark  component, that’s title, href, and description.  55   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  What’s important to realize about props is three things. First, they are always passed   down from a parent component to a child. In the case of the topmost component, you  can consider React itself to be the “parent component” conceptually. In any case, the  source of the information is always the parent component. Now, where the data that is  the value of a prop comes from in the parent can be many things. It could be literal text  as you see in the example code we’re dealing with here. It could be the value of a variable  inside the parent component. It could be a value that comes from some other object that  the parent retrieves. But, from the perspective of the child component, the value comes  from the parent always.  Second, props are only given to the child component when it’s being created. This is  a crucial point because it ties in with the third thing, which is that props are immutable.  This will strike you as odd at first because, I mean, how could that be?! What if we wanted  to change the description of one of our Bookmark components in response to the user  editing it somehow? Clearly, that’s gonna be a problem if props can’t be altered.  But it’s true: once set, props cannot be changed. The way it works is that any time a change must occur to a component, React will  re-render part of the DOM tree. Remember all that stuff about virtual DOM and how  React does diffs to determine what to redraw? Well, the level above that is that some  data in your code needs to change that React recognizes for it to know it has to do any  of that work. We’re going to look at something called state next, but where that matters  in terms of props is that when state changes, whatever that is, React will determine what  components need to be re-rendered as a result.  Not just re-rendered in fact, but destroyed and recreated from scratch! That means  that the component will need to be passed its props from the parent again. If the state  impacts those props – because remember I said the values of props could come from  many places, and state is one of them – then the new values will be passed to the  component when it is recreated. In that way, the description of a Bookmark could  “change” because we will, in fact, wind up with a whole new Bookmark component with a  new description value.  So, yes, props can’t be changed once they are passed to the child and the component   is created with them, but nothing says the component can’t be destroyed and recreated  with all-new prop values, and that’s precisely what happens under the covers.  56   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt   Components  Sometimes  Need Memory: State Effectively, there are two types of data that serve to control component in some way.  You’ve already seen one: props. Now let’s look at the other: state.  Props, you know now, are read-only and do not change during the lifetime of a   component. If props need to change, then the component will be destroyed and recreated.  If you think there must be a more efficient way to deal with data that you know will change,  then you’d be correct, and that way is state. Changes to state do not cause React to destroy  and recreate a component. Instead, it will change just the tiniest portion of the virtual  DOM tree that the change demands, and then the minimum real DOM changes will result.  Let’s see a concrete example. Building on the previous code, let’s make some   changes to our Bookmark class. It will now be  the complete code is Listing 3-4 in the  code bundle accompanying this book :  Listing 3-4.  The Bookmark class  and, by extension, React component   class Bookmark extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;     console.log "Bookmark component created" ;     this.title = this.props.title;   }   render   {     return         React.createElement "li", { },         React.createElement "h2", { }, this.title ,         React.createElement "a",           { href : this.props.href }, this.props.description          ,         React.createElement "button", {           onClick :    => {             this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";             this.setState {} ;           }         }, "Click me"               ;   }  57   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  The first thing to note is the constructor that I’ve added. There are two reasons to  have a constructor  it is otherwise optional . The first is so that when you try this code  out  you are following along and trying the code out, right?! , you will see that when state  changes, the constructor does not fire after the two initial times  one per Bookmark in  the tree , proving that state changes don’t result in component recreation. Note that in a  constructor for a React.Component instance, you must call the superclass’s constructor  and pass it the props that will be passed into the constructor. You’ll get some nasty  JavaScript errors in your dev tools console if you fail to do this  ask me how I know! . The second reason is the line where title is set as a member variable, and its initial   value is taken from the props that are passed in. This variable becomes the state of  this Bookmark component. There are no rules with how you store the state inside your  component. Many people choose to have a single state variable that is an object that  contains all the state for the component, and I frankly tend to do that too. But it can simply be  “naked” class members like this too. Whatever makes sense to you, React will accommodate.  Now, down in the call to React.createElement   that creates the   element,   note the change there: rather than getting the value from this.props like before, it now  comes from this.title. That’s key, as you’re about to see!  A new child element has been added at the end, this one a   HTML element.  Now, the first interesting thing is that the second argument to React.createElement  ,  which you’ll recall is the props to pass to the component, can include functions! At the  end of the day, this argument is just an object, and what’s in it can be virtually anything,  so long as it has meaning to your component  or will just be ignored by it, that’s a valid  possibility too . Here, because we’re creating a button and because buttons typically do  something when clicked, an onClick event handler function is passed in. React knows  how to create a   HTML element and it knows how to attach that function, so we  get a button that does something when clicked, just as we need. The ‘‘something” it does  when clicked is to change the title property of the class.  Now, if that’s all it did, then nothing would happen, at least nothing evident on   the screen. Yes, the value of the variable would change, but React wouldn’t know that  anything had happened. You see, React isn’t monitoring your state and proactively re-  rendering the screen as appropriate. No, you have to inform it that state has changed,  and that’s precisely what the setState   method is for. This method is provided by the  base React.Component class that our Bookmark custom component class extends. It  informs React that this component, and its children, may need to be re-rendered  React  will make the final determination .  58   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  The argument passed to setState   is one of two things: either a function or an   object. If it’s a function, then it’s what is called an updater function. This function  receives two arguments: the current state of the object and its props. This function  must then return an object that will be the new state of the component. It’s important to  understand that this function must not mutate the state object passed in! Instead, it must  create a new object and return it. If you change the incoming state object, then nothing  will appear to happen  unless you return that same object, but that’s a code smell and  can sometimes lead to some real nastiness, so don’t do that .  Alternatively, and what I’ve done in the example, is pass setState   an object, an   empty object in this case. What this does causes React to perform a shallow merge of the  object with the component’s current state. In this case, since I’ve already altered the state  variable, that means that the resulting object has the new value, so what’s returned is a  valid new state object.  Note  in general, it’s probably better to always use an updater function. While it  involves a little more code and work on your part, it tends to be safer. For a simple  example like this, it hardly matters, but as a rule i’d suggest always doing it that  way. and, plus, it’s definitely more of a functional approach, which is a popular  paradigm these days, so if nothing else, you’ll be hangin’ with the cool kids this way!  A crucial thing to understand about setState   is that it is more of a request than   a demand. What I mean is that React will enqueue setState   calls, and the work it  results in, and may batch many requests to optimize DOM updates. So, you aren’t so  much telling React to update the component right now; you’re asking it to do so at some  point in the future. Of course, we’re not talking about hours or even minutes or seconds  later, but the change won’t necessarily be immediate. It is asynchronous in other words,  and as a result, you can also pass a second argument to setState  , a callback function.  This function will be called after the update has occurred. This callback mechanism isn’t  relevant in such a simple example, but you may find times where you do need it, when  you need to trigger some action but only after the screen has been updated.  In the world of React, there’s quite a lot more to state than this  if you’ve ever heard  the term Redux, then that’s one such thing: it’s another way of dealing with state more  globally, but it’s a topic I won’t be covering in this book . But, at an elementary and  fundamental level, this is what state is all about, and you absolutely can use what you’ve  learned in this section alone to deal with state in your React apps.  59   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  Note  One other point of terminology: as you’ve seen, not all components have  state. these are, quite obviously, termed stateless components. any component  that has state is, equally as obviously, called a stateful component.   Making Them Look Good: Style The final thing I want to touch on is styling in a React app.  Now, at the end of the day, when building an app with React we’re still talking   about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Components will always render down into some  combination of those. So, we can do things very directly if we wish. For example, if we  want to make the color of our Bookmark titles red, we could add this to the page:      h2 {     color : red;   }        .bookmarkTitle {     color : red;   }    60  That’ll get the job done. Of course, we could put this in a separate .css file and   import it into the document, just like always with CSS.  Another alternative is to explicitly name a CSS class to use in the component’s code.   So, let’s alter that style definition a little bit:  Now, in our Bookmark code, the call to React.createElement   that creates the     for the title specifically, let’s use that style:  React.createElement "h2", { className : "bookmarkTitle" }, this.title   Since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, React makes us use className instead.   But that will result in the style being applied all the same.   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt  You could also define the style inline with the element, like this:  React.createElement "h2", { style : { color : "red" } }, this.title   The style prop must be an object mapping CSS attributes to values. This approach  is an important one because it leads to a concept termed CSS-in-JS. If you notice, you’re  effectively defining your CSS in JavaScript here. Further, there’s absolutely no reason you  couldn’t take that object that defines the styles for the   element out of the React. createElement   call and define it independently:  const bookmarkTitle = { color : "red" }  Then you just do  React.createElement "h2", { style : this.bookmarkTitle }, this.title   You could put all your style objects for your entire application like those in separate   styles.js file, and now you’ve started down the path of skipping CSS, in a sense, and  doing it all in JavaScript. Oh, to be sure, you’re still dealing with CSS obviously, but in an  arguably more flexible way.  However, components are meant to be self-contained entities, remember? Given   that, shouldn’t that include their style too? But, then, isn’t it better code structure to keep  the styles at least somewhat separate from the layout code? Most people think so. All that  taken together, you might wind up with something that looks like this  Listing 3-5 in the  code bundle :  Listing 3-5.  The Bookmark component, now with 100% more style  class Bookmark extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;     console.log "Bookmark component created" ;   }   title = this.props.title;   titleStyle = { color : "red" }   render   {     return         React.createElement "li", { },  61   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt          React.createElement "h2",           { style : this.titleStyle }, this.title          ,         React.createElement "a",           { href : this.props.href }, this.props.description          ,         React.createElement "button", {           onClick :    => {             this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";             this.setState {} ;           }         }, "Click me"               ;   }  Now, the Bookmark component’s style is defined within the Bookmark class, achieving   encapsulation, but then within the class the style information is abstracted from the  code that produces the layout in the render   method. This is arguably a cleaner way to  write component code.  Whichever approach you choose, whatever meets your needs, the bottom line is  that React offers several approaches to styling your components, and thus your user  interface.   In the End, Why React? All of that is fine and dandy, but it doesn’t answer a fundamental question: why would  anyone want to use React?  I think, at least in my mind, a few critical points in React’s favor are the following:     Simplicity – As you’ve seen, React amounts to four fundamental  pillars: components, props, state, and style. There isn’t much to it  as a basic level. It doesn’t take much to get started with it, as you  saw, and it doesn’t have a lot of complicated baggage like some  other frameworks do  the counterargument, of course, is that all  that complexity provides additional power, and ultimately that’s the  judgment call you have to make as a developer .  62   Chapter 3    Client-Side adventureS: reaCt     Easy to integrate into existing projects by not being overly   opinionated – You can add React to an existing project little by little if  you want, and this is in large part thanks to the fact that React doesn’t  impose a rigid application architecture on you like other options do.  Like with the simplicity argument, there is a negative to this: it’s more  possible to screw things up with React than with something like, say,  Angular, precisely because of that lack of opinionated mindset.     A bit of luck! – React began growing in popularity right around the  time something else was happening: Google’s Angular framework,  another popular front-end development tool, jumped from version 1   to version 2. This was a significant event for Angular users because  the version change was not backward-compatible and, frankly,  caused a lot of headaches for a lot of people. Many of those people  began looking for a more straightforward option that didn’t seem as  likely to repeat that mistake, and React was gaining a foothold right  around that time. So, Google and Angular’s misstep aided React, if  only indirectly.     Backing – Many people have less than positive feelings about  Facebook these days, but one thing you can’t deny is that they  are a large corporation, and when a development tool has  sizeable corporate backing, it tends to become a “safe” choice for  technologists to suggest on the job. React has had that going for it  right from the start.   Summary In this chapter, you took your first steps into the world of React. You got a brief tour of  where it all started, why it came into being, and who’s responsible. We talked a bit about  what it offers, why that’s valuable, and why it’s become so popular. Then, you saw some  basic React code and got familiar with the four main pillars of React: components, props,  state, and style.  In the next chapter, we’ll look at a few more advanced React concepts and dive just a   little deeper into what React has to offer us as application developers.  63   CHAPTER 4  A Few More Words:  Advanced React  In the last chapter, we began looking at React, the popular JavaScript application  framework. There, you were introduced to the basic concepts that every React developer  deals with.  In this chapter, we’ll delve a little bit deeper, looking at a few more concepts that are  important when writing React apps. Perhaps most importantly is JSX, which provides us  a better way  in most developers’ opinion, I think it’s fair to say  to write React apps.   A Better Way to Write React Code: JSX JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML, is an extension to the JavaScript language that  adds XML syntax to the language. In a sense, it allows us to embed XML inside JavaScript  without having to resort to things like string concatenation or even DOM methods. At its  core, JSX is interested in allowing us to define tree structures with attributes in a more  elegant way than all those JavaScript function calls you saw in the last chapter.  If you think back to Chapter 1 and the discussion of components, there might be a  light bulb above your head right now! React is nothing but trees  of components  with  attributes  props !  However, although it’s effectively an extension of JavaScript, it’s not a part of   JavaScript! No, it’s a bolted-on thing that requires a preprocessing step, the output  of which is pure JavaScript. But I’m jumping ahead a bit. We’ll get to that in the next  section!  The reason JSX came about – aside from the obvious of developers not liking to   code their UIs as a series of function calls – is because the React team realized that it’s  kind of pointless to separate rendering logic from UI logic. That’s something we’ve been     Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_4  65   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  doing for a long time. For example, you put your markup in an HTML file, but then you   usually  put your UI logic in a JavaScript file. But these things are intrinsically coupled.  How events are handled, how the state of your application changes in response to user  interactions, how data is prepared for display, all of that is mixed together, so does it  really make sense to separate on technology like that?  An argument can be made that no, it doesn’t make sense, and that’s the argument  React makes. Instead, the division in React is on boundaries based on concerns. That’s  where components come into play: they are separating the various concerns a UI has   a button is concerned with letting the user trigger an action, a grid is concerned with  displaying data, etc. . But each component is an encapsulated whole: it contains the  logic that knows how to render itself as well as the logic that knows how to deal with the  various events that can affect it.  While you absolutely can do all of this without JSX just by adhering to some   architectural principles and being disciplined with your code, JSX provides, arguably,  a more elegant way to do so. But, especially since most developers are coming from an  HTML JS CSS background, JSX provides a more natural way into the world of React by  allowing them not to have to think in terms of React.createElement   but in something  more akin to what they’re already familiar with.   Yeah, Okay, So What Does It LOOK LIKE?! So, what does JSX look like? Well, here’s a simple example using a MaterialButton  component  which we’ll assume is a real component and is available to our code, but  this could be any component if course :  const button = <MaterialButton color="red"   onClick="alert 'clicked' ;">   Click Me  ;  Huh? If you’ve looked at JavaScript at all  which, remember, I’m assuming you have   for our purposes here!  that will probably give you cold chills because obviously that  wouldn’t be valid JavaScript syntax! You can’t set markup like that, XML like that, as the  value of a variable! Not without putting it in quotes and making it a string anyway.  Earlier, I mentioned a preprocessing step that we have to do with JSX. That step,  simply put, is to compile it into standard JavaScript. But, before we even get to that,   66   what do we expect that final JavaScript to look like? The answer is that it’s going to look  something like this:  Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  React.createElement    MaterialButton,   { color : "red",     onClick : function   { alert 'clicked' ; }   },   "Click Me"    That should look familiar to you at this point! What’s more, if you embed components in JSX  const button = <MaterialButton color="red"   onClick="alert 'clicked' ;">      ;  you’ll get nested calls as you would expect, given what JSX compiles down to:  React.createElement    MaterialButton,   { color : "red",     onClick : function   { alert 'clicked' ; }   },   React.createElement ButtonLabel, { text : "Click Me" }     Okay, so that’s JSX in simplest terms. But, clearly, if we load that in a browser, it’s   gonna spit it back at us unceremoniously because it’s not valid JavaScript. How do we get  valid JavaScript from JSX? To explain that, we have to take a quick detour and talk about  something called Babel.  67    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  Chapter 4   A Slight Detour into Babel Land When a new version of JavaScript comes out, it takes time for browsers, and the JavaScript  engines they use, to catch up. There is a period of time when there may be some cool new  features in the language that you can’t use without risking some of your customers not  being able to run your code. This is true for the JavaScript engine that underpins Node  too: you may have to avoid some language features as you write your code until the engine  is updated. Sometimes, a particular browser or engine might never implement a feature  you want to use, and certainly trying to keep track of which environment your great new  code will run in and which it won’t becomes a headache in a hurry.  To give a concrete example, consider this bit of JavaScript:  const newArray = [ 44, 55, 66].map  num  => n * 2 ;  That code will work in the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. But it won’t   work in Internet Explorer 11. If your work requires that you support that browser, then  you’ve got a problem if you really want to write your code like that.  That’s a problem that has existed for a long time, but JavaScript has been evolving   quickly over the last decade or so as its usage has increased dramatically, so the problem  has only gotten worse over time. Solutions do exist, though: every new feature in the  language can be refactored and written using the earlier language features, often with  some compromises, but essentially functioning as the new features do. This approach is  often called a polyfill.  That’s not an ideal solution, though, because it’s a lot of work for developers, whether   directly  developing and testing the polyfill itself and ensuring it works across all target  browsers  or indirectly  waiting for someone else to do it and release it to the world .  This is where Babel comes in. Rather than have to go through that effort, Babel allows   you to write your code using the new language features you want. What happens next  is you run that code through Babel, and Babel takes care of generating the appropriate  polyfill code. Babel is considered a transpiler, meaning it transforms and compiles at the  same time. That means your workflow is altered: there is now a step you must do before  you can actually run your code.  To use Babel, you first have to install it. Before that, though, let’s begin a new project.   Choose a directory and npm init the project, using all the default options. Once that’s  done, you can install Babel:  npm install --save-dev @babel core @babel cli  68   Once that’s done, you’ll be able to run Babel. To do so, issue the command  Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  npx babel  The npx command is something that is installed by newer versions of NPM. It’s an  executable, installed alongside the npm executable, that is a proxy allowing you to run  packages and the CLI tools some packages provide. In the past, you would usually be  directed to install Babel globally, which would add the appropriate path entries to your  system, allowing you to run it. Now though, the advice usually given is to install Babel  local to the project  so that different projects can use different versions of Babel as  appropriate . But doing that doesn’t give you those same path entries. That’s where npx  comes in: it lets you run those tools without those path entries.  Now, running Babel like this won’t do anything yet. That’s because, first, you have to  tell it what to transpile. So, let’s create a file called test.js and into it put the code from  before:  const newArray = [ 44, 55, 66].map  num  => n * 2 ;  Then, execute  npx babel test.js  What happens? Well, uhh, still nothing, actually! Babel will echo back the code   from the file, but nothing is changed, nothing is produced. That’s because out of the  box, Babel doesn’t do anything – it doesn’t know how to transform the code. You have  to add some plugins to it to give it that knowledge. Plugins are what define the rules for  transpiling one language  or version of a language  into another. If you want to see a list  of all the plugins available, check out this site: https:  babeljs.io docs en plugins.  For our purposes though, we’ll just need one, which we, of course, can install with NPM:  npm install --save-dev @babel plugin-transform-arrow-functions  Now, there’s still another step, and that’s to tell Babel to use that plugin. To do that,  we have to create one more file: the .babelrc configuration file. Its contents should be  {   "plugins": ["@babel plugin-transform-arrow-functions"] }  69   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  With that in place, Babel now knows to use this plugin when processing our file,   which it will do if we execute the npx babel test.js command again. The output you’ll  then see should be  const newArray = [44, 55, 66].map function  num  {   return n * 2; } ;  Notice how the arrow function was replaced with standard function   syntax?   You’ll likely want to write that output to a file rather than the console, and to do so is   That’s Babel doing its thing!  simple enough:  npx babel test.js --out-file test_new.js  Sure enough, this is a very simple example, and the code looks fairly similar before  and after transpilation occurs. But, for more complex JavaScript, the difference can be  rather drastic.  One final thing, do you think it might be inconvenient to have to install a plugin for   every single JavaScript feature you want to be able to transpile? The answer is, hopefully,  a clear yes! For this reason, Babel provides the notion of presets. These effectively are  logical groupings of plugins that can be enabled all in one batch. There are several  presets, but the two most used are env and react.  The env preset allows you to do this in your .babelrc file:  { "presets": [     [ "@babel preset-env", {       "targets" : {         "browsers" : [ "last 3 versions", "safari >= 6" ]       }     }]   ] }  That tells Babel, “I want you to produce code that will work in the last three versions   of all browsers, and for Safari, support anything from version 6 on up”. Babel will take  care of installing the appropriate plugins. Also, if you’re working in Node and don’t care  about browsers, you can do  70   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  { "presets" : [     [ "@babel preset-env", {       "targets" : { "node" : "7.00" }     }]   ] }  That tells Babel to support Node back to version 7. To make use of this preset, you need to install a single plugin:  npm install --save-dev @babel preset-env  Once that’s done, and .babelrc altered as shown in the preceding text  removing the   @babel plugin-transform-arrow-functions plugin , the output will now be  "use strict";  var newArray = [44, 55, 66].map function  num  {   return n * 2; } ;  That’s the same as before, only now with the "use strict"; at the top and, critically,   not having to explicitly tell it which plugins to use!   Compile JSX The previous section described the env preset, but what about the react preset? That’s  the key to being able to produce plain old JavaScript from our JSX files. To do that, we  have to make some changes. First, we’ll need to install the preset:  npm install @babel preset-react --save-dev  You will then need to add a new preset in .babelrc to let Babel know how to   deal with JSX  and some related React plumbing :  { "presets" : [     [ "@babel preset-react" ]   ] }  71   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  Note  You only need the react preset, you don’t need the env preset, so if you’re  following along, then you can remove the env dependency from package.json.  however, it does no harm to leave it there, so it’s entirely up to you.  Now, rename the test.js file to test.jsx and replace its contents with the JSX    from earlier:  const button = <MaterialButton color="red"   onClick="alert 'clicked' ;">   Click Me  ;  With those tasks complete, you can now run Babel against the test.jsx file, just as   you did against the test.js file before, but now the output should be  const button = React.createElement MaterialButton, {   color: "red",   onClick: "alert 'clicked' ;" }, "Click Me" ;  Just as expected, we get some plain old JavaScript from the JSX, and what’s more, it   looks just like the sort of JavaScript we wrote in the previous chapter!   And Now, Put It All Together Now that we know what JSX is, what it looks like, and how to compile it into valid  JavaScript, let’s put all the pieces together! Here, we’ll take the very simple example from  the previous chapter and rewrite it using JSX.  First, let’s take the simple project created in the last section and rename test.jsx   to main.jsx. That’s our source file that will be compiled into plain JavaScript. But, to do  anything with that final product, we’ll also need an HTML file. So, create a file named  index.html and insert the following content into it:                 72   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt       Intro To React       <script crossorigin src="https:  unpkg.com react@16 umd react.  development.js">        <script crossorigin src="https:  unpkg.com react-dom@16 umd react-dom.  development.js">                                That’s basically the same as what you saw in the previous chapter, minus all the   React code. Instead, the main.js file, which we don’t have yet, is being imported.  So, let’s now get that main.js file! First, we need some JSX to compile into it. To do   that, replace the contents of main.jsx with this:  function start   {    class Bookmark extends React.Component {     constructor props  {       super props ;       console.log "Bookmark component created" ;     }     title = this.props.title;     titleStyle = { color : "red" }     render   {       return                        {this.title}                          {this.props.description}                         {             this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";             this.setState {} ;           }}>  73   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt            Click me                              ;     }   }    ReactDOM.render               Bookmarks                  <Bookmark title={"Etherient"}           href={"https:  www.etherient.com"}           description={"The home page of Etherient"}          >         <Bookmark title={"Frank's Site"}           href={"https:  www.zammetti.com"}           description={"The web home of Frank W. Zammetti"}          >              ,     document.getElementById "mainContainer"     ;  All I’ve done is I’ve taken the code for the final example in the last chapter, and I’ve  replaced all the React.createElement   calls with their JSX equivalents. I’ve done this  in both the custom Bookmark component’s definition and the component tree created  in the ReactDOM.render  . Hopefully, you’ll agree that looks a lot cleaner and easier to  understand.  With that in place, now we can compile our JSX:  npx babel main.jsx --out-file main.js  }  74   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  Oh, but if you do that right now, you’re going to be greeted by an error message   “Support for the experimental syntax ‘classProperties’ isn’t currently enabled.” To deal with  that, we need to install another Babel plugin to provide support for that language feature:  npm install --save-dev @babel plugin-proposal-class-properties  We also need to tell Babel to use it, so an entry is added to .babelrc:  {   "presets": [ "@babel preset-react" ],   "plugins": [ "@babel plugin-proposal-class-properties" ] }  Once that’s done, the compilation should be successful, and we’ll have a main.js file   ready to be used. The contents of that file should look something like this:  function _defineProperty obj, key, value  { if  key in obj  { Object. defineProperty obj, key, { value: value, enumerable: true, configurable:  true, writable: true } ; } else { obj[key] = value; } return obj; }  function start   {   class Bookmark extends React.Component {     constructor props  {       super props ;        _defineProperty this, "title", this.props.title ;        _defineProperty this, "titleStyle", {         color: "red"       } ;        console.log "Bookmark component created" ;     }      render   {       return React.createElement "li", null,       React.createElement "h2", {         style: this.titleStyle       }, this.title , React.createElement "a", {         href: this.props.href       }, this.props.description ,  75   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt          React.createElement "button", {         onClick:    => {           this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";           this.setState {} ;         }       }, "Click me"  ;     }    }     ReactDOM.render React.createElement "div", null, React.  createElement "h1", null, "Bookmarks" , React.createElement "ul", null,  React.createElement Bookmark, {      title: "Etherient",     href: "https:  www.etherient.com",     description: "The home page of Etherient"   } , React.createElement Bookmark, {     title: "Frank's Site",     href: "https:  www.zammetti.com",     description: "The web home of Frank W. Zammetti"   }   , document.getElementById "mainContainer"  ; }  Well, not exactly what we wrote in the previous chapter, but it does bear some   resemblance to it at a high level, and that’s what matters because it proves that our JSX  was compiled into plain JavaScript that uses React properly. Now, if you load index.html  in your browser, you should be greeted with the same screen as this example produced  in the previous chapter, complete with button click event handling.  That, in a nutshell, is JSX!   Whither Props? JSX lets us pass props into our components just as easily – maybe even easier – as we do  with the direct React.createElement   calls. You saw it earlier when the color of the  MaterialButton was set. But what about when the value of a prop isn’t static like that?   76   That’s where prop expressions come into play. Here’s an example of passing a prop, in  this case, a variable color to the MaterialButton component from earlier:  Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  const buttonColor = "red"; const button = <MaterialButton color={buttonColor}   onClick="alert 'clicked' ;">   Click Me  ;  Now, the buttonColor variable’s value will be passed as the value of the color prop   when the MaterialButton component is created.  Any valid JavaScript expression can be contained within the braces, so we could do  color={buttonColor + "Alt"}  You can also pass string literals using expressions. So, color="red" is equivalent to   color={"red"}. There’s no real reason to prefer one over the other except perhaps if you  want to use expression notation consistently. React and JSX don’t really care either way  though.  Note too that props in JSX syntax will default to true if you pass nothing for   their value. So, in   is equivalent to <MaterialButton  enabled={true}  >.  You can also use the spread operator for a prop value when you want to pass all the   properties of an existing object as props to a component. For example:     You could write this differently using the spread operator:  const props = { color : "red", enabled : true };    This can be handy if you have several prop values that need to be dynamic, and you   need to “calculate” the values elsewhere in your code before the component is constructed.   Default Props Recall from earlier, in the last chapter, actually, I said that parent components always  pass props down to their children, which then use them however they wish  or not  at all – entirely their choice! . This works great in most cases, but what happens if a   77   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  component doesn’t pass a particular prop down to the child? There’s nothing that  enforces a parent passing all props down to its children, so it’s something that can  happen.  One simple thing you can do is, in the child component, something like this:  class Bookmark extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;     console.log "Bookmark component created" ;   }   title = this.props.title;   titleStyle = { color : "red" }   render   {     return                    {this.title}                      {this.props.description  "Unknown" }                     {           this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";           this.setState {} ;         }}>         Click me                        ;   } }  Take a look at the   element there. Notice the  in the expression that defines the   text of the element? If the parent doesn’t pass down a description in the props, then  using the or operator like this will result in “Unknown” being the text of the  .  While that will work, sprinkling or’s all over the place doesn’t exactly make for clean   code, and React recognizes this. So, instead, you can use the defaultProps property.   78   This is a special property that React makes available on the component class, and it is  where you can define default values for props:  Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  class Bookmark extends React.Component {   constructor props  {     super props ;     console.log "Bookmark component created" ;   }   static defaultProps = { description : "Unknown" };   title = this.props.title;   titleStyle = { color : "red" }   render   {     return                    {this.title}           {this.props.description}            {           this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";           this.setState {} ;         }}>         Click me                        ;   } }  Here, we go back to just referencing this.props.description in the   definition  like before, but now the defaultProps definition right after the constructor provides the  “Unknown” value when the parent doesn’t pass a description down. You can supply  default values for all props, or any subset you want to in this way.  It's a handy facility that makes for much cleaner code, so it’s usually a good idea to   define defaultProps. Remember that if you don’t do so and a prop isn’t passed, its value  is going to be undefined. That might be okay in some usages, but not all  e.g., indeed, we  wouldn’t want to show “undefined” for the text of that   element .  79    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  Chapter 4   Typing Props In the next two chapters, and for the remainder of this book, we’re going to be writing  our code not in JavaScript, as all the examples thus far have been written in, but in  TypeScript. Not to jump ahead, but TypeScript adds the notion of data types to the  normally type-less JavaScript  well, loosely typed to be really more accurate, but to a  large extent, the distinction doesn’t matter .  However, even if you wanted to stick with plain old JavaScript, having some notion   of data types is usually a Very Good Thing tm . Imagine if you had a prop on a component  that expects a number, which maybe it does some calculations with, and then displays  the output. What happens if you mistakenly pass a string instead? Well, React and  JavaScript underneath it are going to do their best to work with what you gave them. In  some cases, you might get a valid result displayed. In others, though, the type coercion  that will happen under the covers might result in a gibberish answer.  To avoid that, React introduces something called propTypes. This is like   defaultProps in that it’s another property of a component class, but this time it’s one  used to tell React what the types of your props are. If you then pass an incorrect type at  runtime, React will output a helpful message to the JavaScript console.  To use it, you must do two things. First, add propTypes to the component class:  function start   {    class Bookmark extends React.Component {     constructor props  {       super props ;       console.log "Bookmark component created" ;     }     static propTypes = { description : PropTypes.number };     title = this.props.title;     titleStyle = { color : "red" }     render   {       return                        {this.title}                          {this.props.description}              80   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt              {             this.title = this.title + "-CHANGED";             this.setState {} ;           }}>           Click me                              ;     }   }    ReactDOM.render               Bookmarks                  <Bookmark title={"Etherient"}           href={"https:  www.etherient.com"}           description={"The home page of Etherient"}          >         <Bookmark title={"Frank's Site"}           href={"https:  www.zammetti.com"}           description={"The web home of Frank W. Zammetti"}          >              ,     document.getElementById "mainContainer"     ;  }  Here, I’m doing something kind of silly just to prove the point: I’m defining the   type of the description prop as a number. That doesn’t make much sense, but it will  demonstrate how this works well enough.  81   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  But, if you compile that and try to use it, you’ll hit an error because PropTypes isn’t   known, and that value is what tells React what type the prop is. So, we need to import  that. All you need to do is add a   tag to the index.html file:                     Intro To React       <script crossorigin src="https:  unpkg.com react@16 umd react.       <script crossorigin src="https:  unpkg.com react-dom@16 umd react-dom.       <script crossorigin src="https:  unpkg.com prop-types@15.6 prop-types.  development.js">   development.js">   js">                                PropTypes is supplied in a separate module, so that’s what we need to import. Once  both those things are done, and after you compile the JSX file and open the HTML page  in your browser, you’ll see the following error in the dev tools console:  react.development.js:1818 Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop  `description` of type `string` supplied to `Bookmark`, expected `number`.  in Bookmark  Perfect! React is aware of the type of the description prop and flags it when we pass   a string rather than a number. This makes finding some otherwise tricky to ferret out  bugs very easy, so it’s generally good advice to always supply propTypes on your custom  components, right alongside defaultProps.  There are about two dozen prop types available as of this writing, and you can find  a list of them here: https:  reactjs.org docs typechecking-with-proptypes.html.  These types are actually functions and are called validators. As such, it’s quite possible   82   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  for you to add your own just by appending them on to the PropTypes class or, more  usually, just passing a function in propTypes:  static propTypes = { description : descriptionValidator };  The descriptionValidator   function will be passed the collection of props, the  name of the prop being validated, and the name of the component. If it then returns  null, then React assumes everything is okay; otherwise, the function would return  an Error object  another class provided by the PropTypes module  that describes the  problem.  Note  one that is worth calling out is PropTypes.element.isRequired. this  tells react that your component requires one and only one child component. this is  common enough that I wanted to mention it specifically.   Component Lifecycle The final topic I want to talk about concerning React is the component lifecycle. You’ve  already seen one: the render   method. But, while render   is really the final thing  we’re trying to get to with a component, it’s not the whole picture.  Every single React component goes through a series of distinct stages in a well- defined   order, which is illustrated in Figure 4-1.  83   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  Figure 4-1.  The lifecycle events of a React component  In sequence, during initial construction, the order will be as follows:    1.  The component class’s constructor is called. That should be   pretty obvious: it’s a JavaScript class after all, and if they define a  constructor, then that always gets called first  and if they don’t specify  a constructor, then an automatically added one will be called .    2.  The getDerivedStateFromProps   method is called. This is   responsible for returning an object to update the state, or null  if there is nothing to update. This is called during the initial  construction of the component, called “mounting” because it’s  when the component is constructed, of course, but is also when  it is added, or “mounted,” to the virtual DOM, as well as during  subsequent updates.    3.  The render   method is called. You already know about this one!    4.  The componentDidMount   method is called immediately after the   component is inserted into the virtual DOM. This is where you  can do initialization that required actual DOM nodes.  84   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt  During an update, the sequence will be as follows:    1.  The getDerivedStateFromProps   method is called.    2.  The shouldComponentUpdate   method is called. The results  of this tell React whether the component’s output is affected  by the current change in state or props. By default, the method  automatically supplied will result in re-rendering on every state  change, and unless you have good reason to do otherwise you  should rely on this functionality.    3.  The render   method is called.    4.  The getSnapshotBeforeUpdate   method is called. The   job of this method is to capture some information from the  DOM, like perhaps scroll position, right before the render  output is committed to the DOM, potentially changing it. Like  shouldComponentUpdate  , most of the time, you should just let  the default version of this method do its thing.    5.  Finally, the componentDidUpdate   method is called. Things like   network requests for data you need to display are often done here.  But you can ignore this if you don’t need it.  You can override any of these, or none of them  except for render  , of course,   which you have to override  as your needs dictate.  Note  there are a small handful of other available methods, but they are now  considered legacy, and developers are discouraged from using them, so I’m not  describing them here. I wanted to mention this though in case you see code using  them you will be aware that it’s probably valid code, but no longer code you should  follow, and it’s also code that, it’s a good bet, will be broken by a future react  update when support for those lifecycle events are removed from react entirely.  85   Chapter 4    a Few More words: advanCed reaCt   Summary In this chapter, you got a look at a few more React concepts, including JSX, the  component lifecycle, PropTypes, and default props. Going along with JSX you got a brief  introduction to Babel. This places all the necessary tools for working with React in your  toolbox, preparing you for the application code to come.  But there’s one more preparatory topic to look at before the application train leaves   the station, and that’s where we migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript.  86   CHAPTER 5  Building a Strong  Foundation: TypeScript  In the previous four chapters, where we looked at Node and React, in both of those, you  saw code written in JavaScript. That makes total sense given that Node uses Google’s  V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, and React is  most usually at least  used to create  browser-based applications, and browsers speak JavaScript  along with HTML and CSS  of course .  But there is, at least arguably, a better option, one that overcomes many of the   perceived shortcomings of JavaScript and makes for more robust code and easy  maintenance of JavaScript-based applications. That option is called TypeScript, and in  this chapter and the next, I’ll introduce to you the core concepts associated with what  has become one of the hottest languages around.  As with Node and React, this chapter and the next are not an exhaustive discussion   of the topic. You won’t learn every last nook and cranny TypeScript has to offer. But these  chapters will build the foundation. Further concepts will be introduced in context in the  coming chapters as necessary.   What Is TypeScript? Somewhere around October of 2010, Microsoft started to realize that JavaScript, while  becoming very popular, had several shortcomings that frequently lead to more error-  prone code written by developers. In the eyes of some people, both inside and outside of  Microsoft, JavaScript wasn’t a mature enough language for what was being built with it. So, the company began an internal project to address what they, and many others,  saw as problems with JavaScript. In October of 2010, they made public that project and  called it TypeScript.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_5  87   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  TypeScript can be thought of as a wrapper, of sorts, around JavaScript, or an extension  to it. A key point to remember is that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.  TypeScript, however, adds things on top of JavaScript, the key thing being data types, as  the name clearly implies. This is a significant benefit because it allows IDEs and other  developer tools to provide IntelliSense to the developer, that is, hints about what types  are allowed in what situations. With JavaScript and its loosely typed nature, mistakes  are easy to make, for example, passing a string where a numeric value is expected. With  TypeScript, those sorts of errors are spotted quickly and easily by various tooling.  Over the next seven years, Microsoft evolved the language, adding additional   features to make TypeScript more robust. Fast-forward to today and TypeScript  version  3.6.3 at the time of this writing  is one of the most popular languages for building   primarily  web-facing applications.  One key element that makes TypeScript different from JavaScript, however, is   that you can’t run TypeScript code in a browser or Node, not natively at least. Neither  browsers nor Node understands TypeScript; they only understand JavaScript. So, when  working with TypeScript, there is a pre-execution step: you must compile TypeScript.  One can imagine a day when, perhaps, browsers and Node will speak TypeScript  natively, and no compilation will be necessary, but whether that day comes, it is not this  day! So, for now, TypeScript must be compiled, or transpiled, as it is frequently termed,  into JavaScript for execution.  But here’s where it gets interesting: what do you compile TypeScript to, exactly?    The answer might surprise you:  TypeScript gets compiled to JavaScript! When TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, all the TypeScript-y bits are stripped out,  leaving just plain old JavaScript. Data types, for example, are purely a development-time  construct. Once compilation occurs, they are gone. But, because they were there during  development, the compiler will flag type-related errors at that time, rather than having  them be discovered at runtime, which is the case with JavaScript generally.  In addition to types, another big advantage of TypeScript is that it supports more  modern JavaScript language features but can compile them down to older versions of  JavaScript. This means that you can use newer features, such as arrow functions and  async await, even in browsers that don’t natively support them, because the compiler  produces code that implements them for you in the older JavaScript dialect that the  browser understands. In the last chapter, we talked about Babel, and in a real sense, the  TypeScript compiler  which we’re going to discuss very soon  does the same thing Babel  does in this regard.  88   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript   Jumping into the Deep End Now that you have a general idea of what TypeScript is, let’s get right down to business  and see it in action! To do this, we’re going to first take advantage of a facility that you’ll  find on TypeScript’s home page at typescriptlang.org called “the playground.” You’ll  find it at typescriptlang.org play, and on that playground, you can enter arbitrarily the  TypeScript code provided below and execute it. It’s a great way to experiment with the  language and a handy way for me as an author to give you your first look at TypeScript  before we need to install any tooling for it!  In Figure 5-1, you can see what it should look like after you enter the example code.  Figure 5-1.  TypeScript in action, on the playground!  In this figure, I’ve executed the code, which you can see on the left. Now, there’s   a couple of things to notice. First, see the red squiggly line underneath the humanName  argument? If you hover over that, it will tell you that humanName implicitly has an any  type. We’ll get to what this means shortly, but for now it’s enough to realize that the  TypeScript playground is examining your code in real time and is pointing out that you  haven’t specified a type for the argument  which may or may not be an error, which is  why you can execute this code despite that being flagged . The critical point is that it  does this before you run the code. That’s the point of types!  However, perhaps the bigger problem related to types is that you’ll notice that the  alert   message doesn’t do what we expect, at least not based on what you’d logically  conclude the point of the sayHi   function is. It’s intended to greet someone by name,  but in this case, we’re passing an object to it. JavaScript doesn’t care of course, there’s  nothing that tells it that humanName really should be a string that contains a person’s   89   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  name, so it just produces an alert   message with the object passed in generically,  which in this case doesn’t give us anything particularly useful and definitely not what we  actually want it to produce.  With TypeScript, though, we can fix this! To do so, we add what’s called a type  annotation to the argument by changing the sayHi   function’s definition to this:  function sayHi humanName: string  {  The value after the colon is the type annotation, and this is the secret sauce you’ll   see time and again in TypeScript code. With that change made, re-running the example  will result in the red squiggly going away from the humanName argument – because we’re  now telling TypeScript what type we expect it to be – but now, we get a red squiggly  underneath the entire object passed to sayHi  . If you hover over it, you will see the  message “Argument of type ‘{ humanName: string }’ is not assignable to parameter of  type ‘string’.” TypeScript is telling us, in no uncertain terms, that we can’t pass an object  to a function that expects a string. Cool, right?  Of course, if we change the call to sayHi   to  sayHi "Luke Skywalker" ;  then the alert   shows us exactly what we expect: “Hello, Luke Skywalker!” A few more things to note about this simple example is that TypeScript, based on   the error message from the object, seems to have known that the value of the humanName  property of the object passed to sayHi   was a string even though we didn’t explicitly  tell it. This implicit typing is called type inference, and TypeScript does it any time you  declare and initialize a variable in one go  which, obviously, works for object properties  like here too . If you declare a variable without initializing it, though, or when a function  argument doesn’t specify a type, then TypeScript assumes a specialized type: any. This  effectively mimics how JavaScript works in that the variable or argument can take a value  of any type at any time.  If you’re thinking that using TypeScript with nothing but type any references would   be kind of silly, then you would be right! As a rule, in TypeScript, you should always  declare your types. In fact, even when declaring and initializing in one statement, it’s  still probably a good idea to declare the type. There may be situations where any makes  sense, but you should explicitly decide that if so  and yes, you can declare a variable of  argument as being of type any expressly .  90   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript   Beyond the Playground Now, the playground is a useful thing to have available, but clearly you aren’t going to be  using it to develop your real applications. Instead, you’ll need to be able to compile and  execute TypeScript code on your own machine, and that’s where your new best friend,  tsc – the TypeScript compiler – comes in!  Installing it is simple, using our friend NPM:  npm install typescript  As usual, it’s your choice whether you want to install it locally or globally  remember   that adding the -g argument installs an NPM package globally . Either way, this installs  several TypeScript-related things, but the key thing that we care about here is tsc, the  compiler, which is your one-stop shop for working with TypeScript code. It can act as a  task runner and a bundler and can take the place of Babel, as previously mentioned. Using it is simplicity itself: all you need to do is execute tsc and tell it what file to   compile by doing  tsc    Let’s go ahead and take it for a spin! Drop to a command line and navigate to an   empty directory. Install TypeScript and then create a new file named index.html with  the following contents:                        Now, create a file named app.ts and in it put the code we just executed on the   Once that’s done, compile it using tsc with this command:  playground.  tsc app.ts  After that, load up index.html in your favorite browser, and you should see the   alert   message, just like on the playground.  91   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  If you look in the directory, you’ll see that an app.js file was created. That’s your   compiled code, which is then loaded by index.html  notice that we do not load app.ts  in index.html because the browser wouldn’t know what to do with it .  Looking at app.js, you can see what tsc has produced from your code:  function sayHi humanName  {     alert "Hello, " + humanName + "!" ; } sayHi "Luke Skywalker" ;  In this simple example, the only real difference is that the type information for   humanName was stripped off, which confirms what I said earlier: types are only for  development time, not runtime.   Configuring TypeScript Compilation Now that you’ve seen how to install and use tsc, let’s talk a little bit more about it and  about TypeScript projects.  Usually, your projects will be a bit more complex than just a single file to compile.   Typically, you’ll have multiple .ts files to compile. You could pass all the names on the  command line to tsc, but that will get burdensome in a hurry. Instead, you can create  a file named tsconfig.json that will allow you to define your project a little bit and  configure how tsc works.  You don’t need to write this file by hand, though! The tsc tool comes with a handy  option, -init, that will create a basic tsconfig.json file for you. Go ahead and, in the  same directory as the last section, run  tsc -init  You’ll find a tsconfig.json file has been created. The presence of that file effectively   makes this directory the root of a TypeScript project as far as tsc goes.  One of the first benefits this provides is that now, you can execute tsc without any   arguments, and it will dutifully compile any .ts files in the current directory, as well as  subdirectories. That’s already worth the effort, right?  The tsconfig.json file isn’t required, as you saw earlier, and it has no required   elements in it either. However, it does provide a large number of options to configure  your project. I won’t be going over all of them here, but you can see all available options  online at typescriptlang.org docs handbook tsconfig-json.html.  92   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  I will, however, introduce options as needed throughout the remainder of these   chapters, but for the most part, default options will be used. In fact, when you run that  init comment, only the following options are enabled  with their default value shown in  parentheses :      target  es5  – Specifies the ECMAScript  JavaScript  target version  that the generated JavaScript will adhere to: es3, es5, es2015, es2016,  es2017, es2018, es2019, or esnext     module  commonjs  – Specifies the module loader system that will  be used  modules and loaders will be discussed in the next chapter :  none, commonjs, amd, system, umd, es2015, or esnext      strict  true  – Enables all strict type-checking options     esModuleInterop  true  – Enables generation of interoperability   code to allow for interoperability between CommonJS and ES  modules via the creation of namespace objects for all imports  As I mentioned, by default, tsc will compile all files in the current directory and   subdirectories  if necessary  if a tsconfig.json file is present. If you know you need it to  skip specific files though, you can add the exclude element, and then list the files not to  compile. You can also explicitly include things with the files element. These are probably  two of the most commonly used additional options, hence why I’m mentioning them here.   The Nitty Gritty: Types Now, let’s get to the main event in TypeScript and discuss the various types that it  supports. As previously mentioned, types are declared with the :  syntax. This can  be in a function declaration to type the arguments:  function sayHi humanName: string  {  You can also declare the type a function returns:  function concatStrings str1: string, str2: string : string { }  It can also be used in a variable declaration of course:  let a: string = "Hello";  93   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  In all cases, it’s just a colon, followed by one of the supported types, which we’ll look   at now.   String You’ve already seen the string type a few times, and it’s no different from the normal  string in JavaScript:  const bestShowEver = "Babylon 5";  As mentioned earlier, TypeScript automatically infers the type of bestShowEver as   string, which means this will result in a compiler error:  bestShowEver = 42;  But also, as I said before, it’s better to  nearly  always declare the type:  const bestShowEver: string = "Babylon 5";  Now there are no games to be played: bestShowEver is a string, and that’s the end of it!   Number TypeScript offers a single number type. There are no integer vs. floating-pointing values in  TypeScript; they’re all simply numbers. So you can do  const a: number = 42;  And you can also do  const b: number = 3.14;  a = "42"; b = "3.14";  And, of course, you’ll get an error if you try to do either of these:  As with JavaScript, TypeScript allows for hexadecimal and octal literals, though the   way you specify octal is different than JavaScript:  const a: number = 0xf00d; const b: number = 0o744;    Zero followed by lower-case o  94   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript   Boolean The TypeScript boolean type is as simple as it gets; it has a value of true or false and  nothing else:  const isThisTheBestBookEver: boolean = true;  Note that even though 0 and 1 are oftentimes interchangeable for boolean values and  will be evaluated as boolean values in logic statements in at least some cases, TypeScript  does not allow it:  const isThisTheBestBookEver: boolean = 1;    Compiler error  This extra rigidity helps avoid some tricky bugs, so let’s all say a hearty “thank you” to   TypeScript for saving us from ourselves!   Any The any type, which I mentioned earlier, is the type that a variable, argument, or function  return will have if you don’t specify a type explicitly:  let accountBalance; accountBalance = 15000; accountBalance = "15000";  Either of those assignments will be okay with tsc because TypeScript will infer type   any for the variable.  Of course, you can explicitly declare it to be any as well:  let food: any = "pizza"; food = 123;    This is now okay  Even if you’re using the any type  which you should consider carefully if you think   you need to, because often you don’t really want to use it! , it’s still probably a good idea  to always define it, so that anyone reading your code knows you intended it to be any.   Arrays TypeScript supports arrays, of course, what good language doesn’t? Just like with  variables, if you don’t specify a type, the type will be inferred from the initialization values:  const pets = [ "Belle", "Bubbles" ];  95   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  If you initialized an empty array, or had to initialization at all, then type any will be   inferred, just like with variables.  This pets array becomes an array of strings, so you can’t later do  pets = [ 42 ];  variables:  the type.  TypeScript will complain about that because the pets array can only hold strings now. You can also explicitly type an array with just subtly different syntax than for scalar   const pets: string[] = [ "Belle", "Bubbles" ];  You still use the :  syntax, but the array [] notation must be appended after   Now, what if you have an array where you really do want to allow for strings and   numbers, and perhaps other types? Well, this is a case where that any type may well be  exactly what you want to use:  const pets: any[] = [ "Belle", 42 ];  But, again, consider this carefully! Is that really what you want to do, or might it be   better to have two separate arrays? Only you can decide, I’m just suggesting that think it  through either way.   Tuples A tuple is just an array with a specific number of elements of specific types. In plain  JavaScript, that might look like  const authors = [ "Frank", 46 ];  But, critically, there is no enforcement of anything in JavaScript. You could shove a  number as the first element and even have a third element in the array. In TypeScript  though, that’s all enforced, and the way it’s declared is with slightly different syntax:  const authors: [ string, number ] = [ "Frank", 46 ];  Here, we’re saying that the authors array must have two elements, and the first must   be a string, and the second must be a number. As a result, this will not compile:  const authors: [ string, number ] = [ 46, "Frank" ];  96   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  The types of the elements are wrong here  they’re reversed . When you then access   an element, say authors[1], the correct type will be returned, a string in that case.  Since it’s a string, you could call substr   on it, for example, but trying to do the same  on the element returned by authors[0] would result in an error since a number does not  have that method available. Note too that accessing an element outside the set of known  indices results in an error, so authors[2] will result in an error.   Enums While JavaScript offers a string, a boolean, and a number type  despite it being a loosely-  typed language, the types do still technically exist , enums are something that JavaScript  does not natively offer; they are purely a TypeScript construct. Enums serve to make  specific sequences of numbers more human-readable and expressive. Take, for example,  this plain JavaScript code:  const Pizza = 0; const FriedChicken = 1; const IceCream = 2;  It’s nice that we don’t need to remember that a value of 1 means fried chicken   in our, I guess, horribly unhealthy food truck sales system – we can use the variable  FriedChicken anywhere we need it – but it’s still kind of ugly that way to a lot of  developers. With enums in TypeScript, which you declare with the new enum keyword,  you can do it more elegantly:  enum Food { Pizza, FriedChicken, IceCream }; let myFavoriteFood: Food.FriedChicken; alert myFavoriteFood ;  That alert   call will show one because TypeScript begins assigning numbers to the  named elements in the Food enum starting from zero. That’s the value Pizza gets. It then  increments by one for each subsequent value, so FriedChicken gets assigned one, and  IceCream gets assigned two  and so on, if we added more foods .  You can assign specific values if you wish too, either from the first element onward or   anywhere in between. For example:  enum Food { Pizza, FriedChicken = 500, IceCream }; let myFavoriteFood: Food.FriedChicken; alert myFavoriteFood ;  97   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  Now, the value shown will be 500. But Food.Pizza would still have a value of zero   since we didn’t assign it a specific value.  Now, here’s a good mystery for you: without trying it on the playground, what value  will IceCream have? Does it have two, maybe, since TypeScript keeps numbering from  where it left off? Or does it perhaps restart numbering, so assigns it zero?  No, it gets a value of 501. Anywhere you explicitly define a value, TypeScript will keep   numbering subsequent items, by one, from that value on.   Function TypeScript lets you declare a function type. This is a way of saying that a variable must  reference a function with a particular signature. For example:  let myMathFunction:  num1: number, num2: number  => string;  Now, myMathFunction can only be assigned a value that is a function with two   number arguments, and that returns a string. So, this is okay:  function add n1: number, n2: number : string {   return "" + n1 + n2; } myMathFunction = add;  But this is not:  function multiply a: number, b: number : number {   return a * b; } myMathFunction = multiply;  Even though the type being returned by multiply   seems to be correct –   multiplying two numbers will yield a number – the contract that was defined for the  myMathFunction variable says any function it references must return a string, whether  that makes sense or not. Note that argument names don’t matter, only types do.  98   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript   Object Earlier, you saw an error message that seemed to indicate that TypeScript was performing  type inference on object properties. As it happens, that’s precisely what it does:  let person = {   firstName : "John", lastName : "Sheridan", age : 52 };  Here, TypeScript infers the type of the object, including its properties, and this is   termed an object type. That means that from this point on, person may only reference an  object with three properties, firstName, lastName, and age, and they must have the types  string, string, and number, respectively. Even trying to assign person = { } later will  result in an error because TypeScript will see that as the property types not matching.  Similarly, trying to do person = { a :"John", b : "Sheridan", age : 52 }  will  be an error because, in contrast to function types, with object types the property names  do matter  it’s only logical: object properties can be in any order, so there’s no way for  TypeScript to reliably determine the types except by name .  Of course, you can also be more explicit if you wish:  let person: {   firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number } = {   firstName : "John", lastName : "Sheridan", age : 52 };  Note that the properties and values within the object definition do not have types   defined. That would be redundant as they are already defined in the object type definition.   Null, Void, and Undefined Three other types are, conceptually, related to one another, so I’ve grouped them  together here. Let’s start with null:  let favoriteCar = "Camaro"; favoriteCar = null;  99   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  Yes, TypeScript has a null type that is different from other “null-like” types.   Interestingly, null is considered subtypes of all other types, which means you can assign  them to anything:  let myFavoriteNumber: number = null; let myFavoriteString: string = null;  That is okay, as would a null assignment to a variable of any other type. In a similar vein as null is undefined:  let favoriteCar;  Here, favoriteCar will have a value of undefined, which is different than null  a   comparison of a variable with a value of null and another with a value of undefined will  not evaluate as equal . But, like null, undefined is taken to be a subtype of every other  type, so similarly you can do a literal assignment with it:  let favoriteCar = undefined;  But what if you do want to ensure a variable is never null? In that case, tsconfig. json is your friend! Under the compilerOptions section, add a key strictNullChecks  and give it a value of true. With that done, the compiler will complain if you assign null  or undefined to any variable except if it is declared as type any.  if you want to have your mind blown, you could do let   Note  myFavoriteNumber: null = null;. this would mean you can only assign  the value null to myFavoriteNumber. Similarly, let myFavoriteString:  undefined = undefined; will only be allowed to have undefined assigned  to it. it’s probably not useful in any way, but it’s a curious side effect of these two  types. Finally, doing let favoriteCar = null; will result in favoriteCar  having an inferred type of null, not any like you might expect, so effectively this  variable can only ever be assigned a value of null!  Finally, the void type is conceptually like the opposite of any: it’s like having no type  at all! The void type is typically only seen as the return type of a function, to indicate the  function returns no value. While you declare a variable as type void, you can only ever  assign a value of null to it  and then, only if strictNullChecks isn’t enabled . Note that   100   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  TypeScript will figure out the return type by default, so most of the time, it isn’t necessary  to specify void, though as long as you know that’s correct, then it’s probably better to be  explicit.   Custom Type Aliases Let’s say you want to create an object type to represent a person. You saw that earlier:  let person = {   firstName : "John", lastName : "Sheridan", age : 52 };  That’s all well and good, but what happens when you need to create two people? In   that situation, you’re going to write something like this:  let person1 = {   firstName : "John", lastName : "Sheridan", age : 52 }; let person2 = {   firstName : "Michael", lastName : "Garibaldi", age : 53 };  As you can imagine, that’s not a great way to do things. As a rule, developers like to  avoid duplicate code like that. Instead, TypeScript offers custom type aliases, which lets  you provide a custom name for a type. To do so, you use the new type keyword, like so:  type PersonType = {   firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number };  From then on, you can use it like any other type:  let person1: PersonType = {   firstName : "John", lastName : "Sheridan", age : 52 }; let person2: PersonType = {   firstName : "Michael", lastName : "Garibaldi", age : 53 };  You can choose any name you like; it doesn’t have to have type in it as it does here.   That way, if you want to change the type definition, you can do it in just one place.  101   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  You can even alias native types if you want:  type MyAwesomeString = string; let str: MyAwesomeString = "test";  There probably isn’t a whole lot of reason to do that, but you can  some people use it   as a form of documentation in effect, but I personally would counsel against doing so .   Union Types Sometimes, you’ll have a situation where you want a variable to be able to hold one of  several different types, or you want an argument to accept one of various kinds, but you  don’t want to use any. In that case, union types are the answer.  It might be okay that myAge can store a number or a string because maybe the rest of   your code can handle either. Maybe you’ve got some code like this:  Take this code, for example:  let myAge: any; myAge = 46; myAge = "46";  if  typeof myAge == "string"  {   alert parseInt myAge  * 2 ; } else if  typeof myVar == "number"  {   alert myAge * 2 ; }  But what if you tried to do this?  myAge = true;  let myAge: number  string; myAge = 46; myAge = "46"; myAge = true;  102  Unfortunately, that will be allowed because myAge is of type any, and being able  to assign a boolean to it would be bad since our code doesn’t handle that  plus, for a  variable that, presumably, stores a person’s age, a boolean doesn’t make sense .  So, instead, we can use a union type, which is denoted with the pipe character:   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  You can read that as saying that myAge can be of type number or type string.   Therefore, the first two assignment statements will be okay, but the third, trying to assign  a boolean, will result in a compiler error.   TypeScript == ES6 Features for “Free”! When you compile a TypeScript file with tsc, it’s really doing a transpilation. It’s  “compiling” from TypeScript to JavaScript. Earlier, I said that tsc does much the  same thing as Babel does, and that’s true in this regard. The implication of this is that  TypeScript supports most ES6 features. It doesn’t support all of them, though, so it’s  good to know which you should avoid. Fortunately, there is a handy chart you can use  here: kangax.github.io compat-table es6.  Let’s not be negative though, let’s talk about some of the features you can use! Note   that the assumption is that you already have some JavaScript knowledge, so I’m not  going to cover every last thing in intricate detail, but certainly, these are probably the  most important things that you should be aware of.   The let and const Keywords First, as all the example code I’ve shown so far do, you can freely use the let and const  keywords  let for variables you want to be able to change the value of later, const for  those you don’t . Yes, you can still use the var keyword too, but it’s suggested you don’t  since both let and const have block scope rather than var’s global scope, which helps  avoid a lot of insidious bugs.   Block Scope Speaking of block scope, that’s another important one! In JavaScript, variables for a long  time could only be declared with var. Such variables have function scope  or global  scope when declared outside of any function . That means that you can do some “weird”  things like this:  function test   {     if  true  {       var greeting = "hello";     }  103   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript      alert greeting ; } test  ;  Most people see it as a bit weird that you can alert greeting  there and have it   work despite greeting being declared inside the if block. Well, with let, that problem  is solved! That same code, by just changing var to let, results in greeting only being  available inside the block it’s declared in, the if statement in this case. If you enter  that on the TypeScript playground, it will even flag it as an error. This helps avoid some  interesting problems that can crop up when using var. The same is true for const, but  with that you get the addition of not being able to change the variable’s value later. As a  general rule, you should use const whenever possible, or let when it’s not, and avoid  var unless you have a specific reason to use it.   Arrow Functions With all the examples shown so far, I’ve used the standard function definition format  that uses the function keyword. If, like the Dude from The Big Lebowski, you’re into the  whole brevity thing though, you can use arrow functions instead:  const test =  name  => {   alert `Hello, ${name}` ; } test "Jack" ;  be even shorter if the function returns a value:  const addNums =  a, b  => a + b; alert addNums 2, 3  ;  Arrow functions allow you to skip typing the function keyword all the time. They can   Here, we don’t need to type the function keyword, and we don’t even need to type   the return keyword!  But we’re talking about TypeScript, and yet there are no types here; this is just plain   JavaScript. Not to worry, you can type things as well with arrow functions:  const addNums =  a: number, b: number : number => a + b; alert addNums 2, 3  ;  104   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  But brevity isn’t the only benefit of arrow functions, and maybe not even the   biggest. That distinction probably goes to how the keyword this is handled. In plain  JavaScript, what this points to can vary depending on how functions are called. With  arrow functions, though, lexical scope is used, which means that whatever contains the  function is what this will point to at execution time. If the function is in global scope,  then this will point to the window object  assuming we’re executing in a browser . If the  function is inside an object, then this will point to that object. It’s simple and consistent,  and TypeScript makes it available to you!   Template Literals Something worth noting in that last example is another ES6 feature that you can use in  TypeScript: template literals. The backtick ` character denotes a template literal string,  and within it you can insert any valid JavaScript  or TypeScript  expression by wrapping  it in ${}. Note that I said expression there because while you can insert variables as  shown, you can do arbitrarily complex things:  alert `Hello, ${name.toUpperCase  .substr 2 }` ;  Another great thing about template literals is that they can span multiple lines of   source code:  alert `Hello,   your name is   ${name} ` ;  Try that with a plain old string, and you’ll face syntax errors, but with template   literals, it works just fine.   Default Parameters With TypeScript you also can use default parameter values. That means that you can do  this:  const multNums =  a: number, b: number = 10 : number => a * b; alert multNums 3  ;  105   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  Here, we’re saying that if the second number isn’t supplied when multNums   is   called, then it should have the default value 10. Hence, we get 30 in the alert   when  this is executed. This is a simple thing that winds up saving you a lot of time and extra  code, so it’s truly nice to have in TypeScript too.   Spread and Rest  and as an Added Bonus: Optional  Arguments  The spread operator, which is three periods together, allows an iterable item, things like  arrays or strings, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments  in the case of  function calls  or elements  for array literals  are expected, or an object expression to be  expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs  for object literals  are expected.  As an example:  const addNums =  a: number, b: number : number => a + b; const nums: number[] = [ 5, 6 ]; alert addNums ...nums  ;  The idea here is that we want to “spread” the values in the nums array into the   arguments passed to addNums. This is in contrast to writing something like  alert addNums nums[0], nums[1]  ;  However, if you try that code, you’ll find that there is an error on the ...nums spread  argument passed to addNums   that says “Expected 2 arguments, but got 0 or more”. The  issue here is that because there’s a variable number of possible arguments, TypeScript  can’t make a proper determination about what to do. Fortunately, there are at least two  ways to fix this. First, you could do this:  const addNums =  a?: number, b?: number : number => a + b; const nums: number[] = [ 5, 6 ]; alert addNums ...nums  ;  See those question marks after the arguments of the addNums   function? Those   are how you indicate optional arguments in TypeScript. Doing that tells TypeScript that  the argument may or may not be present. In this case, we’re saying that both can be  optional. Now, that doesn’t make much sense from the perspective of what the function  does, but it does result in TypeScript not flagging this as an error. Note that when using   106   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  optional arguments, they must always come last, meaning you can’t do  a?: number,  b: number  because a required argument can’t come after an optional one.  However, note that if you pass in three or more values in the nums array, only the first   two are added. The function works the same as it did before; the optional arguments  only serve to get around the syntax error situation.  The other way you could fix this is by the use of the rest operator, which is simply the   spread operator in a different place:  const addNums =  ...a: number[] : number =>   a.reduce  acc, val  => acc + val ; const nums: number[] = [ 5, 6 ]; alert addNums ...nums  ;  Any argument prefixed with the … operator means that zero or more arguments can   be in that place. The result is that you’ll get an array inside the function, named as the  argument is named, that contains all passed in values in that place. As with optional  arguments, rest arguments must come last. With this approach, given we have an array,  we can use the reduce   method to add up all the numbers passed in. In contrast to the  optional argument approach, this solution results in all the numbers being added, no  matter how many are passed in, so it is functionally different, and therefore, which way  you go depends on what you’re trying to do.   Destructuring TypeScript supports two forms of destructuring: object and array. And while knowing  that is great, knowing what destructuring is would be even better, no?  Consider the following object:  const person = {   firstName : "Billy", lastName : "Joel", age : 70 };  Now, if you want to grab the values out of that object, you might do  const firstName = person.firstName; const lastName = person.lastName; const age = person.age;  107   That’ll work, but it’s an awful lot of typing! With destructuring, you can get at that   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  data more concisely:  const { firstName, lastName, age } = person;  Now, you’ll have three separate variables named firstName, lastName, and age, and  their values will be taken from the person object, because TypeScript  really JavaScript   knows, by virtue of you using the curly braces around the variables, the names of the  properties in the object you want to pull out and does so for you. Sweet!  Arrays can be destructured in the same way:  const vals = [ "Billy", "Joel", 70 ]; const [ firstName, lastName, age ] = vals; alert firstName ; alert lastName ; alert age ;  Here, of course, it’s based on order: TypeScript is essentially just doing   firstName=vals[0] and lastName=vals[1] and age=vals[2] for you under the covers.  And, as a bonus, for your next job interview, if you get asked the question of how  to swap the value of two variables without using a third, here’s an answer using array  destructuring in TypeScript:  Here, the array being destructured is created on the fly on the right-hand side of the  equals, and then it’s just array destructuring as described in the preceding text. “You’re  welcome” in advance for when you ace that interview and make a ton of money at your  new job!  let x = 1; let y = 2; [ x, y ] = [ y, x ]; alert x ;    2 alert y ;    1  108   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript   Classes The final topic I want to cover in this chapter is classes. JavaScript, at least of the  ECMAScript 5 and higher variety, supports classes, but TypeScript alters the syntax a bit  and adds a fair bit of – wait for it – class! It really classes the place up is what I’m saying!  I  know, I know, terrible dad joke!   First, when it comes to properties, rather than having to declare them in a constructor,  you can do them a little more elegantly. Instead of this   Properties  class Planet {   constructor   {     this.name = null;     this.mass = null;   } }  you can instead do this:  class Planet {   name: string;   mass: number; }  do that in the constructor:  class Planet {   name: string;   mass: number;  It may not be a huge difference, but it makes JavaScript look a lot more like other   object-oriented languages syntactically.  As you would expect, you can declare your types for the properties like anywhere else  in TypeScript as you see there, but now, you don’t need to embed them in a constructor.  You, of course, still can have a constructor, and that looks the same as in plain JavaScript,  but your property declarations are external to the constructor now, if you supply one at all.  Naturally, if you want to set property values at construction time, then you can still   109   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript    constructor inName: string, inMass: number  {     this.name = inName;     this.mass = inMass;   } }   Member Visibility  TypeScript adds the notion of member visibility to classes. With plain JavaScript classes,  all members are public, that is, available to all other code  there are some tricks you  can play to simulate private members so that they are only available to the code of the  class itself, but it’s not something offered by the language intrinsically . As with plain  JavaScript, TypeScript’s default visibility is public, but now you can have both private  and protected members:  class Planet {   private name: string = "none";   protected mass: number;   constructor inName: string, inMass: number  {     this.name = inName;     this.mass = inMass;   }   public printName   {     alert this.name ;   } }  Here, the name property will only be accessible by code within this class. The mass  property will be accessible by code within this class as well as by code in any class that  extends this one. Putting public before the printName   method is optional since that’s  the default, but you definitely can do so if you want to be explicit. Note too that, as I’ve  done for name, you can assign a value as part of the declaration if you wish.  110   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript   Inheritance  When I described protected, I said that it allows the member to be accessible to code  within the class and to code in classes that extend it. That provides for inheritance, which  is another capability that TypeScript adds  or, more precisely, augments . Let’s create a  specific planet:  class Jupiter extends Planet {   private colorBands: boolean = true;   constructor   {     super "Jupiter", 1234 ;   } }  Now we can do  let j: Jupiter = new Jupiter  ;  Now we’ve got an object of type Jupiter, which extends from the Planet class. A few  things of note here. First, members can be added to the subclass, as with the colorBands  property. Second, calling j.printName   works as expected, because printName   has  public visibility. But, if you try to do alert j.name , then you’ll find that you get an  error from TypeScript saying that “Property ‘name’ is private and only accessible within  class ‘Planet’.” The same is true if you try to alert j.mass .  However, understand that while j.printName   will print Jupiter’s name, if you try   to put a method in the Jupiter class itself that accesses name, that won’t work. Private  members are not inherited, so while the code of the Planet class knows about name and  can work with it, the code in the Jupiter class does not and so can’t do anything with it   you could, of course, call methods in the base class from the child class to work with it  though .  Another thing of note is that if a subclass has a constructor, as Jupiter does, then it   must call the superclass’s constructor via the super   reference.  An interesting point to understand is that you can override anything in the   superclass in the child class, as you can in any good object-oriented language. You must  be aware, though, that for properties, those defined in the body of the child class will  override any value passed into the constructor. So, if you add protected mass: number  = 5555; to the Jupiter class, then the value of its mass property will be 5555 no matter  what you pass into the constructor.  111   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  With TypeScript, you can override members in the parent class as in most other   object-oriented languages, and that works as you’d expect. However, TypeScript doesn’t  support method overloading in the way most people expect. For example, this won’t  work in the Planet class:  The compiler will complain that you have a duplicate function implementation even   though the return types are different. Even a different argument list isn’t enough:  public calcSuperMass  : number {   return this.mass * 2; } public calcSuperMass  : string {   return "" + this.mass * 2; }  public calcSuperMass  : number {   return this.mass * 2; } public calcSuperMass a: number : string {   return "" + this.mass * a; }  That still won’t be allowed for the same reason. Now, all hope is not lost, though: you   can, in effect, achieve overloading by using optional parameters or default parameters.  So, you could do either of the following:  public calcSuperMass massMultiple?: number : number {   if  massMultiple  {     return this.mass * massMultiple;   }   return this.mass * 2; }    Or: public calcSuperMass massMultiple: number = 2 : number {   return this.mass * massMultiple; }  112   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  In the first approach, since massMultiple is marked optional, you can effectively   have calcSuperMass   work whether you pass in an argument or not, at the cost of the  branching inside the function. In the second approach, you can skip that logic because  now a has a default value even if you don’t pass it.  I would suggest the second is the better way, but either will achieve the goal. Now, if   you instead want to overload the type of an argument, you could use a union type:  public calcSuperMass a: number  string : number {   if  typeof a === "number"  {     return this.mass * a;   } else {     return this.mass * parseInt a ;   } }  That, too, will work. However, it’s probably worse than either of the other two since   you are in a sense  kinda sorta maybe  going around the type system. But, while it  probably doesn’t make much sense in this instance, you certainly could have situations  where you do want a single function to handle multiple types, in which case this  approach gives you a way to do overloading like you want.   Getters and Setters  It is generally considered an excellent pattern to make data members in classes private  and then, when necessary, provide outside access to them via getter methods  or  accessor methods . Similarly, allowing private members to be set through setter  or  mutator  methods is also typically considered good form. Especially for setters, this  enables you to have some code that checks incoming values to ensure they are valid in  whatever way makes sense for your application.  Because this is so common a pattern, TypeScript offers syntax specifically for these   types of methods:  class Planet {   private _name: string = "No name set";   get name   {     return `This planet's name is '${this._name}'.`;   }  113   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript    set name inName: string  {     if  inName === "Pluto"  {       this._name = "Not a planet";     } else {       this._name = inName;     }   } } let p: Planet = new Planet  ; alert p.name ;    'No name set'. p.name = "Pluto"; alert p.name ;    'Not a planet'  sorry, little guy!  p.name = "Venus"; alert p.name ;    'Venus'  The get and set keywords prefixing a method indicate a getter and setter method,   respectively. What this does for you is it allows you to access the member by the name of  the method. In other words, p.name is the same as executing p.name   would be, but you  can’t call p.name   because TypeScript will tell you that “This expression is not callable.  Type ‘String’ has no call signatures.”, which is just a fancy way of saying that getters and  setters aren’t methods in the usual sense, but they do execute when you access or set the  property that matches the method’s name. Note too the use of the _name identifier for  the actual property name. TypeScript doesn’t require the underscore – you can use any  name you wish – but the key point is that the getter and setter method names cannot be  the same as that of the private property they access, and prefixing with an underscore is  a popular choice to ensure they aren’t the same but are still related in some logical way.  Also, worth noting is that you can make read-only properties by only supplying  a getter. Another way to achieve this is by prefixing the property with the readonly  keyword:  class Planet {   readonly name: string = "No name set"; } let p: Planet = new Planet  ; alert p.name ;    Okay p.name = "Neptune";    Error  114   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  Remember, name will be public by default, which means you normally can do p.name  = "Neptune". But, with readonly before it like that, tsc will give an error on that line. This  is a good choice if you have properties that you do want accessible, but you know can  never be changed by outside code since it will save you from having to provide even a  getter. As with much of newer JavaScript and TypeScript, saving a little typing appears to  be the primary goal sometimes!  TypeScript classes also provide for static members, both properties and methods:   Static Members  xxx  class Planet {   static theBorgLiveHere: boolean = true; } alert Planet.theBorgLiveHere ;    true  Notice that, in contrast to all the properties and methods you’ve seen so far that are   tied to instances of a class and are thus called instance members, we can access the value  of theBorgLiveHere without an instance of Planet being created first. That’s the very  definition of static, and it’s just that easy with TypeScript!   Abstract Classes  The final topic related to classes to discuss is abstract classes. An abstract class is simply  one that cannot itself be instantiated. It is always meant to be a base class that others  extend from. They serve a similar function as interfaces, a topic we’ll look at in the next  chapter, but the primary difference is that an abstract class can provide some amount of  implementation for methods while an interface cannot.  So, by way of example:  abstract class BasePlanet {   name: string;   radius: number;   constructor inName: string, inRadius: number  {     this.name = inName;     this.radius = inRadius;   }  115   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript    abstract collapseToBlackHole inMoreMass: number : void;   calcDiameter   {     return this.radius * 2;   } }  Given this class, with the abstract keyword before the class keyword indicating this   is an abstract class, we can never have an instance of BasePlanet. Instead, we can only  have, perhaps, Earth instances:  class Earth extends BasePlanet {   collapseToBlackHole inAdditionalMass: number  {        Perform physics-breaking 2001-like monolith magic here   } }  The other thing to note is that while BasePlanet implements calcDiameter   –   because calculating the diameter of a planet from its radius is the same for all  planets  well, basically the same; this is a book about programming after all, not  astrophysics, so we can ignore some intricacies I think!  – it does not implement  collapseToBlackHole  . The declaration of that method inBasePlanet is declared  abstract, just like that class, which is a thing you can totally do! And besides, it has  no function body, so it wouldn’t do much even if that were syntactically allowed. That  means that an extending class must implement it, as the Earth class does  and, again,  since Stephen Hawking is not here to correct us – rest in peace, good sir – we’ll ignore the  fact that collapsing any body to a black hole essentially comes down to enough mass in  a small enough diameter, so you probably wouldn’t need each child class to implement  that method either . This is an excellent way to “push” the common functionality into  a base class while still ensuring that an extending class implements those things that it  really must implement to be a valid instance of the base class in a logical sense.   Summary In this chapter, you got your first look at TypeScript. You got some historical perspective  and then saw some of the biggest things it adds to JavaScript, including types  obviously! ,  ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, and classes. You learned how to  compile TypeScript to JavaScript and a little about how to configure that compilation.  116   Chapter 5    Building a Strong Foundation: typeSCript  In the next chapter, we’ll look at more of what TypeScript brings to the table,   including concepts like namespaces, modules, interfaces, decorators, and a bit about  debugging. Once through this chapter and the next, you’ll have the foundational  knowledge about TypeScript on which we can begin to build some projects, along with  Node, React, and a few other tools. But let’s not put the cart before the horse. Jump over  to the next chapter to continue on with TypeScript!  117   CHAPTER 6  A Few More Words:  Advanced TypeScript  In the last chapter, we started looking at TypeScript as a replacement for JavaScript in  our projects  though, of course, you now know that it’s not actually replacing JavaScript  at all, it’s just enhancing it significantly . Now it’s time to turn the dial up to eleven and  explore some other aspects of TypeScript.  The title of this chapter includes the word “advanced” in it, though whether the   things in this chapter are especially advanced or not as people typically mean the  word is up for debate. It’s probably more accurate to say this chapter is just covering  some additional TypeScript topics which aren’t necessarily more advanced than the  others from the previous chapter. I’ll also include some extra things that are specific to  TypeScript and which aren’t found  directly, at least  in JavaScript.  Please note that all the code in this chapter is meant to be executed in the   playground. You certainly can compile it with tsc, but to run it, you’ll need an HTML file  to load it. The playground is doing all that for you, so for quick, small things like are in  this chapter, it’s easier just to use the playground.   Interfaces Interfaces offer a way to define “contracts” within your code or for code that must  interface with your code to follow. While types by themselves do this to some degree,  interfaces take the concept to a much greater extent and provide much more power to  you as a developer.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_6  119    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Chapter 6   Argument Object Interfaces To begin our discussion of interfaces in TypeScript, let’s first look at a simple TypeScript  example:  function greet person: any  {   alert `Hello, ${person.firstName}` ; } const person = { firstName : "Frank" }; greet person ;  That, of course, will alert “Hello, Frank” at runtime. But if person didn't have a   firstName property, then you would instead see “Hello, undefined”. That’s not even a  TypeScript thing, that’s just basic JavaScript.  Situations like these are where interfaces come in: that act as a contract that your   code must adhere to in order to avoid such situations. Let’s modify that example by  creating an interface:  function greet person: { firstName: string }  {   alert `Hello, ${person.firstName}` ; } const person = { name : "Frank" }; greet person ;  The interface is defined directly inline in the argument list of the greet   function.  Rather than naming a type for the person argument, we instead provide an object, and  within that object, we list the properties and their types that the object must have. With  that in place, the call to greet   will result in a compiler error since the object passed  to greet   here doesn't have the firstName property, it has a name property, which is  wrong according to the contract defined by the interface. That proves that TypeScript is  performing type checking against the defined interface.  Now, it should be evident that defining the interface “inline” like that probably isn’t  the best way to do things. If we had another function that we wanted to require the same  contract, we’d need to duplicate the interface in two places. TypeScript, as I’m sure you  can guess, gives us a way to define the interface separate from its usage:  interface IPerson {   firstName: string; };  120   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  The name of the interface can be anything you wish, but I like to put a capital I in   front of it like here so that I can at a glance differentiate it as an interface from, say, a class  name.  Now, we can use that interface in the same way as when it was defined inline:  function greet person: IPerson  {   alert `Hello, ${person.firstName}` ; }  function greetLouder person: IPerson  {   alert `HELLO, ${person.firstName}!!!!` ; }  const person = { firstName : "Frank", hairColor : "Black" };  greet person ; greetLouder person ;  Here, take note that the object you pass to greet   can have other properties not  named in the interface. That’s fine. It simply must have those defined by the interface,  though, or the contract isn’t met.  Somewhat curiously, if you pass an object literal, in that case you can only specify   properties that are in the interface. Otherwise, you'll get a compiler error. In other words,  while the previous code works, this will not:  function greet person: IPerson  {   alert `Hello, ${person.firstName}` ; }  function greetLouder person: IPerson  {   alert `HELLO, ${person.firstName}!!!!` ; }  greet { firstName : "Frank", hairColor : "Black" } ;  121   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  You can either define the object separately, as in the first example, or you can use   optional parameters to avoid the problem. If you add a ? after the property’s name in the  interface, then that means it's optional, and now it will work:  interface IPerson {   firstName: string;   age?: number; };  function greet person: IPerson  {   alert `Hello, ${person.firstName}` ; }  greet { firstName : "Frank" } ;    Okay   Methods in Interfaces Interfaces aren’t just about object properties though; you can define methods in  interfaces as well:  interface IPerson {   firstName: string;   getGreeting lastName: string : string; };  const person = {   firstName : "Frank",   getGreeting lastName: string  {     return `Hello, ${this.firstName} ${lastName}`;   } };  function greet person: IPerson  {   alert person.getGreeting "Zammetti"  ; }  greet person ;  122   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  The result is that when defining an object that will be passed to a function that   demands an interface, the methods listed in the interface must be implemented in the  object, same as the properties, as getGreeting   is implemented in this one.   Interfaces and Classes In most object-oriented languages that provide classes and interfaces, classes can  implement interfaces to ensure they provide a given contract, and TypeScript is no  different:  interface IPerson {   firstName: string;   greet  : void; };  class Person implements IPerson {   firstName: string;   constructor inFirstName: string  {     this.firstName = inFirstName;   }   greet   {     alert `Hello, ${this.firstName}` ;   } }  const p = new Person "Frank" ; p.greet  ;  You can, of course, add other properties and methods to the class as you wish, but as  with interfaces for function arguments, you must implement what the interface declares  at a minimum with any class that implements it.  Note that classes can implement more than one interface at a time. You simply name   them all in a comma-separated list after the implements keyword. And, naturally, you  must fulfill the contracts defined by all of them.  123    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Chapter 6   Extending Interfaces As with classes, interfaces can extend other interfaces so that you can build them up as  needed:  interface IPerson {   firstName: string; }  interface INinja extends IPerson {   numberOfSwords: number; }  let ninja = {} as INinja; ninja.firstName = "Ryuki"; ninja.numberOfSwords = 2;  Here, you can see how the INinja interface extends the IPerson interface.   Something else you can see is the use of the as keyword. This tells the TypeScript type  checker to treat an object as being of a given type. An empty object, as ninja starts out  as, isn’t an INinja automatically as far as TypeScript knows. It’s just a plain old object,  after all! But, when you say as INinja, that’s telling TypeScript exactly what type you  want that object to be treated as for the purposes of type checking at compilation time.  That means that any rules and conditions the ninja object must meet according to the  interface named will be checked. Some of them get checked anyway, as you saw in some  of the previous examples, but this is a more explicit way to ensure they happen as you  expect. It’s a good idea to explicitly type using as in cases like this where the type isn’t  implicit anyway, such as when instantiating a class.  interfaces do not get compiled to Javascript in any way, shape, or form.   Note  they are entirely a typescript construct used at compile time. if you look at any of  the code produced by these examples  which, remember, you can always see on  the right-hand side of the typescript playground in real time , you’ll see that all the  interface information is stripped away entirely.  124   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript   Namespaces and Modules Namespaces and modules are two concepts that help you to organize your TypeScript  code by partitioning them in some logical fashion. We’ll start with the simpler of the two   in my estimation at least , namespaces.   Namespaces A namespace is, simply put, an object that contains other code. It provides a wrapper,  of sorts, for that code, thus keeping it out of global scope  avoiding global scope  pollution in JavaScript is always crucial to avoiding unforeseen consequences, and since  TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript, the rule applies in TypeScript just as much .  A namespace is easy to create:  namespace MyFirstNamespace {   export let homeworld = "Jakku";   export function sayName   { alert "Rey" ; }; }  The namespace keyword, unsurprisingly, denotes a namespace definition, which  you then give a name  MyFirstNamespace  and then open and close the block as you  would any other code block, with braces. Inside the block, anything you define is only  accessible within that namespace unless you export it. As you can see, you can export  variables and functions, both of which you can then access as follows:  alert MyFirstNamespace.homeworld ; MyFirstNamespace.sayName  ;  You can also export classes and interfaces from a namespace:  namespace MyFirstNamespace {   export class Jedi { }   export interface RebelScum { } }  125   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  To get a handle on this, it can be informative to look at the JavaScript code produced   from this TypeScript code:  "use strict"; var MyFirstNamespace;  function  MyFirstNamespace  {     MyFirstNamespace.homeworld = "Jakku";     function sayName   { alert "Rey" ; }     MyFirstNamespace.sayName = sayName;     ; }  MyFirstNamespace   MyFirstNamespace = {}  ; alert MyFirstNamespace.homeworld ; MyFirstNamespace.sayName  ;  As you can see, TypeScript uses the IIFE  Immediately Invoked Function Expression    pattern to keep the namespace’s contents separate from everything else on the page  when the code finally executes, thereby keeping global scope nice and clean  aside from  the namespace object itself, obviously .  Because what’s inside the namespace is partitioned off from everything outside, it  means that you could have a homeworld variable elsewhere, and they will not conflict:  You don’t need to worry about naming conflicts when you use namespaces properly,   which is indeed a nice problem to avoid in a large codebase!  While namespaces can help organize your code within a single file, they become a   bit more useful when you realize that you can break them up into multiple files:  namespace MyFirstNamespace {   export let homeworld = "Jakku"; } const homeworld = "Coruscant"; alert MyFirstNamespace.homeworld ;    Jakku alert homeworld ;    Coruscant     app.ts SomeNS.someFunc1  ; SomeNS.someFunc2  ;     file1.ts namespace SomeNS { export someFunc1   { } }  126   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript     file2.ts namespace SomeNS { export someFund2   { } }  But, to make this work, you must import both of the resultant .js files  file1.js and   file2.js  in the HTML file that you execute to run your app  and, of course, you also  need to import app.js . Just because they’re used in app.ts  and ultimately app.js   doesn’t mean that they are automatically available for use like that. Instead of having to  import multiple .js files in the HTML document, you can instead have tsc bundle them  for you:  tsc --outFile main.js file1.ts file2.ts app.ts  This will result in a single main.js file being produced that includes the  compiled    contents of file1.ts, file2.ts, and app.ts.  Note  when bundling like this, you must be aware that order can matter. the files  are concatenated in the order you provide, so if the result of that concatenation is  that some code references other code that isn’t in proper source order in the   final output file, then you can wind up with a runtime error. here, if you had   app.ts before file1.ts and file2.ts, then code found in app.ts might  throw a runtime error when it tries to use something defined in either of those files  since they will appear after the app.ts contents in the final main.js file.  Even better than having to bundle or import separate .js files and worry about their   order is to use a TypeScript-specific syntax for important namespaces, the     symbol.  To use it, in the app.ts file, you would write               TypeScript, at compile time, will take care of bundling those files together. In this  case, you only name the output file, not all the files that go into it, and TypeScript will  take care of the rest, including that things are in the correct order.  Once you have the code bundled or properly imported, something else you can do is   save yourself some typing by aliasing things in a namespace:  import h = MyFirstNamespace.homeworld;  127   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  This way, you can just do alert h  to see “Jakku.” You can dig into nested   namespaces if you need to  meaning alias as many levels down in nested namespaces as  you wish  or alias the entire namespace itself if you want a shorter simpler more logical  name.  Oops, I mentioned nested namespace there, didn’t I? That’s the final thing about   namespaces I want to mention: they can indeed be nested! Take a look:  namespace SomeNS {   export namespace InnerNS {     export someFunc   { }   } } SomeNS.InnerNS.someFunc  ;  Referencing someFunc   requires that we dig down through the nested namespace   hierarchy, which is what I was talking about before with aliases. If you wanted, you could  do  import sf = SomeNS.InnerNS.someFunc; sf  ;  That’s much more concise – though whether it’s actually better is only a call you    can make!  With namespaces, nested or otherwise, how you organize and group your code is   entirely up to you, whatever makes the most sense, that’s the big takeaway.  If it strikes you that namespaces are a lot like classes and interfaces, then I’d say   that’s a reasonable observation. They aren’t the same, of course – you don’t instantiate  namespaces as you do classes, and you don’t implement namespaces as you do  interfaces, to name two differences – but they do serve a similar partitioning function.  But namespaces are more lightweight and are purely about code organization, whereas  classes are about things and interfaces are about contracts, so as with anything, choose  the tool appropriate to the task at hand.  128   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript   Modules Modules are another way of organizing your code, a more powerful way, in fact, than  namespaces in many ways.  A module is defined as any TypeScript source file that contains one or more import   or export statements at the top level  meaning not inside a function . Any source file  that doesn’t meet that requirement is considered an ordinary script source file, and its  contents will be made available in global scope like always.  Modules represent their own scope, which is another way of saying that anything   inside the module is not visible to anything outside the module unless explicitly  exported  and subsequently imported elsewhere , nor can any code inside the module  touch anything outside of itself unless explicitly imported. That’s similar to a namespace,  but remember that a namespace always results in at least the namespace object itself  existing in global scope, that’s the big difference.  At the code level, you can export anything you like from a module  assume this is in a   file named Modules :     Variable export let captain = "Picard";    Interface export interface CaptainChecker {   isGreat inName: string : boolean; }    Function export function addFirst inLast: string : string {   return "Jean Luc " + inLast; }    Class export class Ship {   const name = "Enterprise"; }    Type alias export type cap = captain;  129   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  To then make use of this, in another source file, you would import the things you   need from the module:  Import { addFirst } from ". MyModule"  After that, you can execute it like any other function:  addFirst "Riker" ;    Wrong last name, but not the point!  Alternatively, you could write your module like so:  function addFirst inLast: string : string {   return "Jean Luc " + inLast; } export addFirst;  It’s really just a matter of style choice whether you want to separate the export   from the definition of what you’re exporting. But, with the latter approach, you can do  something else:  export { addFirst as myAddFirstFunc }  Now, addFirst will not be available for import, myAddFirstFunc will be instead. In  this fashion, you can have a different name internal to the module as what is externally  exposed. Again, it’s a matter of style and little else.  If you want to import an entire module, there is a handy shortcut for that:  import * as TheModule from ". MyModule"  Modules can also have a single default export. You simply use the keyword default   after the export keyword for the item you want to make the default export:  export default let captain = "Picard";  What that does for you is that now your import can be this:  import cap from ". MyModule"  It’s just a bit simpler of a statement, that’s all. One nice thing about modules is that you never have to worry about ordering,   meaning what order the various JavaScript files get loaded in. Modules are declarative,  meaning everything is based on imports and exports. The reason this can work is that  modules require a loader. You see, browsers don’t know how to deal with modules   130   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  on their own. Instead, a loader, which is just some JavaScript that knows how to load  modules, takes care of it.  There are several competing module formats and loader mechanisms that have   evolved over the years. Some offer slightly different syntax for importing and exporting.  Perhaps the best-known module loader, and most used, is called SystemJS. To use it, you  must install it first:  npm install --save systemjs  Then, in the HTML file that loads your app, instead of loading, say, app.js directly,   you instead load the module loader:      Naturally, you can move that file to another location if you wish, there’s no need to  leave it in node_modules. But either way, after that, you add some new code to the page:  SystemJS.config { baseURL : " ",   packages : { " " : { defaultExtension : "js" } } } ; SystemJS.import "app.js" ;  This configures the module loader, providing it the base URL from which modules   are resolved, and allows you to specify which modules are to be loaded  here it’s just  saying load whichever are present in the directory . After that, you tell the loader to load  your starting file, app.js, and it takes care of the rest! Any imports in app.js, as well  as any exports in any modules, will now be handled by the loader. All the imports and  exports that you wrote in your original TypeScript source files will be compiled down to  JavaScript that knows how to interact with the module loader, which will then take care  of loading everything and ensuring everything is in the right order as necessary.   Decorators Decorators are an interesting addition to JavaScript that is still in the proposal stage  at the time of this writing, but which TypeScript offers as an experimental feature. In  order to use them, you have to add the experimentalDecorators:true option to your  tsconfig.json file  or, optionally, you can pass the --experimentalDecorators switch  to tsc, which you can, in fact, do for most options in tsconfig.json if you would prefer  not to have the config file at all but still use these sorts of options .  131   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Decorators are essentially metadata that you can add to the definition of a number of  code elements. If you’ve ever seen annotations in other languages, like Java, then you are  already familiar with the basic concept. Decorators are expressed in the form @ ,  where name must evaluate to a function at runtime. This function will be passed  information about the element decorated.  For example, say we want to provide some logging in the constructor function of a   class. Let’s further say that for whatever reason, we don’t want to modify the code within  the class  maybe we didn’t write it ourselves and don’t want to mess around with code  provided by someone else . For this, you can use a class decorator. You can do that as  follows:  function logConstructor inConstructor: Function  {   console.log inConstructor ; }  @logConstructor class Spaceship {   constructor   { console.log "constructor" ; } }  const s = new Spaceship  ;  Here, we have a function, logConstructor  , that we decorate the Spaceship class  with. The class just has a simple constructor in it. If you run this in the playground and  look in the console of your browser’s dev tools, you should see something like this:  VM68:9 class Spaceship {     constructor   { console.log "constructor" ; } } VM68:12 constructor  When the class is instantiated, the function is called. A class decorator like this is   always passed just the constructor, but remember that it’s the runtime constructor,  which is why we get the entire Spaceship function and not the constructor defined at the  source level. In this example, that constructor is logged. Then, the actual constructor of  the class that is defined in it executes, which is where the second log output comes from.  This decorator mechanism provides us an opportunity to modify the class definition  if we want, even potentially returning an entirely new class definition  though, as you  might imagine, you can really muck things up by doing that if you aren’t careful .  132   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Note  you may see different vM values here, or you might not see any at all,  or it might be on the right-hand side. any of these are okay. the vM notation is  something Chrome dev tools  and some other browsers’ dev tools as well  does  when it can’t identify the source of some Javascript. vM stands for virtual machine  and refers to the Javascript virtual machine, which of course is ultimately the  source of the code. this frequently happens when using the Javascript eval     function, and given what the typescript playground does, it’s not hard to imagine  that probably comes into play at some point to make it all work, so seeing those  vM strings somewhere isn’t surprising. they’re also irrelevant for what we’re doing  here, but it’s good to know what it’s all about so as to avoid any potential confusion  about why what you may see when you run the code isn’t 100% identical to what’s  printed here.  The other types of decorators are the following:     Method – Placed just before a method declaration, the decorator  function will be passed either the constructor for a static class or  the prototype of the class for an instance member, the name of the  decorated method, and a descriptor for the method.     Accessor – Placed just before an accessor declaration, the decorator   function will be passed either the constructor for a static class or  the prototype of the class for an instance member, the name of the  decorated accessor, and a descriptor for the accessor.     Property – Placed just before a property declaration, the decorator  function will be passed either the constructor for a static class or the  prototype of the class for an instance property and the name of the  decorated property.     Parameter – Placed just before the name of the parameter in a   function argument list, the decorator function will be passed either  the constructor for a static class or the prototype of the class for an  instance member, the name of the decorated parameter, and the  ordinal index of the parameter in the function’s argument list.  133    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Chapter 6   Decorator Factories Sometimes, you’ll want to be able to pass information to a decorator in order to vary  what the decorator does. To achieve that, you can create a decorator factory. In simplest  terms, this is a function that returns a function. The function returned is the actual  decorator function, and the function that returns it is the decorator factory.  That may seem a bit confusing, so let’s see it in code:  function logConstructorFactory inEnabled: boolean  {   if  inEnabled  {     return function inConstructor: Function  {       console.log inConstructor ;     }   } else {     return function   { };   } }  @logConstructorFactory true  class Spaceship {   constructor   { console.log "Spaceship constructor" ; } }  @logConstructorFactory false  class Spacestation {   constructor   { console.log "Spacestation constructor" ; } }  const s = new Spaceship  ; const t = new Spacestation  ;  The logConstructorFactory   function is the factory. It returns a function, but what   function it returns depends on the inEnabled argument passed in. This will give us the ability  to enable or disable logging: when true, we get the function that contains the console.log    call; when false, we get an empty function so that no logging will occur in the latter case.  Then, the decorator attached to the Spaceship and Spacestation classes now   pass a boolean value to it, enabling logging for the Spaceship class and disabling it for  Spacestation. When executed, in the console you’ll see  134   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  VM73:11 class Spaceship {     constructor   { console.log "Spaceship constructor" ; } } VM73:16 Spaceship constructor VM73:22 Spacestation constructor  As expected, the constructor of the Spaceship class is logged, but the constructor of   Spacestation is not.  decorators, not just class decorators.  As with plain old decorators, you can use decorator factories for all five types of    Third-Party Libraries TypeScript, all by itself, is pretty great, but modern software is virtually never built with a  language alone. Almost certainly, you’ll want to bring in third-party libraries to help you  along, and you most definitely can do that with TypeScript.  First, to state the obvious, you can use any of the JavaScript libraries you already   know and love. Once your TypeScript is compiled down to JavaScript, it neither knows  nor cares what other JavaScript code you use.  But you can also bring in third-party TypeScript libraries, and that’s really what   this section is talking about. Most frequently, you’ll use NPM to import them into your  project, the same as any other module you use from NPM.  Let’s say, for example, that you want to use the popular Lodash library in your code.   First, you’ll need to install Lodash like any other NPM module:  npm install --save lodash  But now, there’s an additional step: you must also import another related library:  npm install --save-dev @types lodash  This extra library is called a type declaration file, or a type binding file sometimes,   and it’s what tells TypeScript  tsc, more specifically  all about the types that Lodash uses  and provides. With that done, you can now use Lodash in your TypeScript code:  135   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  import * as _ from "lodash"; _padStart "TypeScript + Lodash = COOL!", 10, "*" ;  It’s that easy! What’s better is that because of that type declaration file, tsc  and your  TypeScript dev tool of choice  knows about Lodash in terms of TypeScript so that it can  provide all the same warnings, errors, and IntelliSense, just like it does with your own  code.  In NPM, most libraries that provide TypeScript bindings have a secondary library   prefixed with @types, so you should look for those when choosing a library. Not all  libraries offer them, of course, but that may well factor into your decisions about what  libraries you use and which you don’t.  Caution  one caveat to be aware of: if you use a library like this, you will almost  certainly want to add an exclusion in tsconfig.json to skip the node_modules  directory. if you don’t do this, tsc will try to recompile any .ts file in it.   Debugging TypeScript Apps Since TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript, you, of course, could debug the JavaScript  directly with all the same tooling you use at other times, be that browser dev tools or  a full IDE of some sort. But that isn’t ideal because you aren’t debugging the code you  wrote, and that’s rarely something you want to do. Besides, the output JavaScript can  look very different than the input TypeScript, so it might be challenging to do even if you  wanted to.  Given that TypeScript isn’t something that executes directly, that would seem to  preclude the ability to use a debugger to step through the code, or do any of the other  things a debugger allows you to do. Sure, you can always revert to good ole’   console.log   debugging, and sometimes that’s even easier than a full debugger, but  most developers prefer having proper, purpose-made tooling, a debugger being one.  Fortunately, there is a solution available to allow you to use most of the same  debugging tools as you do regular JavaScript, and it’s pretty simple: source maps.  136   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript   Source Maps A source map is an additional file that is generated by tsc when you append the  --sourceMap option to it:  tsc --sourceMap app.ts  With that option, you’ll find that alongside the app.js file that is produced, there will   also now be an app.js.map file. This file provides debugging tools with… wait for it… a  map  bet you didn’t see that coming!  that correlates the original TypeScript source to  the generated JavaScript source.  It really is just that simple! Wanna see what such a file looks like? Here you go:  {   "version": 3,   "file": "app.js",   "sourceRoot": "",   "sources": [ "app.ts" ],   "names": [ ],    "mappings": "AAAA,SAAS,KAAK,CAAC,SAAiB;IAC9B,KAAK,CAAC,YAAU,SAAS,MAAG,CAAC,   CAAC;AAChC,CAAC;AACD,KAAK,CAAC,gBAAgB,CAAC,CAAC"  }  Note that if you look at a real file it’s all on one line, but I’ve expanded it here to make   it a bit easier to comprehend. Now, to be clear, you really aren’t meant to look at this  file yourself. The truth is it doesn’t make much sense to me either when you get to the  mappings property  though the rest is pretty obvious I’d say ! I’m sure I could go look up  how this file works, but in the end, it doesn’t matter. The tools know what to do with it,  which is what matters.  Now, let’s go back in time to Chapter 5 and the example code there. Remember that,   as shown in Figure 6-1?  137   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Figure 6-1.  It’s a simple example, but it gets the job done – again!  To refresh your memory, here’s the code behind that wondrous display:  function sayHi humanName  {     alert "Hello, " + humanName + "!" ; } sayHi "Luke Skywalker" ;    sourceMappingURL=app.js.map  Hey, wait a minute. That’s not the same as in Chapter 5! Indeed, that last line   wasn’t there. That’s the line that tells your tooling that a source map file exists and it’s  something else the --source Map option does. With that in place, the magic happens, as  you can see in Figure 6-2.  Figure 6-2.  The magic of the source map line  138   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  As you can see, Chrome dev tools sees that line, and as a result, it can even tell you  that a source map has been detected. If you look over on the left, you’ll see something  else: there is now an app.ts file listed! Even though Chrome doesn’t speak TypeScript  natively, that file is now available, and clicking it reveals what you see in Figure 6-3,  which shouldn’t be at all surprising.  Figure 6-3.  Hey, look, we have our original code!  Yep, we have our existing code now! Note, however, that for this to work, the app.ts  file must be available. So, on a real web site, you would need to deploy this file to your  server as well as the final .js file. Therefore, this isn’t something you generally will want  to do on a production server. Source maps are a development tool, not a production  support tool.  With access to the original source code, we can now use all the debugger goodness   Chrome dev tools offers, including breakpoints, as you can see in Figure 6-4.  Figure 6-4.  Using Chrome dev tools to debug TypeScript  139   Chapter 6    a Few More words: advanCed typesCript  Execution has paused on the alert   line, and we can inspect variables, step into   the code, and do all the other things that a proper debugger allows.  Pretty cool, right?   Summary In this chapter, you learned about a few more TypeScript concepts, things that might be  considered “advanced”  though that adjective is up for debate . Things like interfaces,  namespaces, modules, decorators, third-party library usage, and debugging with source  maps were discussed. Between this chapter and the previous one, you now have a solid  foundation of TypeScript knowledge.  In the next chapter, we’ll look at one more tool that we’ll need in order to start   building apps: Webpack.  140   CHAPTER 7  Tying It Up in a Bow:  Webpack  In the good old days of web development, things were simple. You created a directory,  maybe some subdirectories, if you were a bit more organized, and into it, you poured all  your resources: a stylesheet or two here, a sprinkling of images, some HTML files, and a  heaping helping of JavaScript files. Then, a single HTML file served as your entry point,  and it would go out and load, by way of script tag references, to load all your JavaScript  files, as well as your CSS files and images.  Now, at a fundamental level, that’s precisely still how things work technically, but   over time the picture has gotten… messier. Developers will frequently make use of a  large number of smaller, more focused libraries and toolkits. What we build is orders of  magnitude more complex with far more moving parts, things you need to include.  Of course, people have realized that this isn’t efficient. Each networked request is a   new connection to the server, and many of those requests must occur serially, so nothing  happens until the resources are loaded  and processed in some way . And worse, what if  a script file is loaded at the start that isn’t needed until the user performs some specific  action? What if they never perform that action? You’ve just wasted a bunch of time and  bandwidth and maybe slowed the whole site down for something that you didn’t wind  up even needing!  And that’s before we even talk about how you have to self-organize the code, think of   things like ensuring scripts are loaded in the proper order and that everything that one  script depends on is both included and loaded before it’s used, that code that references  other code can find one another at runtime.  And all that is before we talk about newer JavaScript tricks like modules and the  problem of cross-browser development and the desire to use more modern coding  techniques while still supporting older browsers  to a point at least .    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_7  141   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  As this evolution has occurred, before long, developers were looking for a way out  of this mess, and that’s when the notion of bundles was born. In this chapter, we’ll talk  about one specific bundler: Webpack.   What’s a Bundle, and How Do I Make One? In simplest terms, a bundle is a conglomeration of various resources that a web page  needs to function. The obvious component of a bundle is JavaScript, but in some cases it  also includes CSS and even images, encoded for use in data URLs  if you aren’t familiar  with the concept, that’s where an image, or other file, is Base64-encoded and included  as a string as the source, most commonly, of an   tag using the data: prefix . A  bundle most frequently is a single file, though no rule says it must be  well, I would  argue that a bundle is always a single file, and if you have multiple files, then you, in fact,  have multiple bundles – but either way the basic concept is the same . The benefit of  a bundle is that it is, usually, just a single request across the network, plus the fact that  when creating a bundle, you can layer on other optimizations like code minification and  compression and such.  How does one create a bundle? Well, at the most fundamental level, you could do   it manually by merely concatenating all your JavaScript files together into one. Do that,  and you’ve got yourself a bundle! But, in that case, it’s a bundle of only JavaScript, no  other resources like CSS or images, and perhaps, more importantly, is that when you do  that you have to take on responsibility for ensuring everything is in the right order and  that there are no conflicts. IIFEs, or Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, are a  way to solve these problems. If each thing you concatenate is inside an IIFE, then there  are no worries  well, mostly at least  about scope collisions. Plus, that way, the order  no longer matters. The problem with this solution though is that any time a single file  changes, you have to rebundle everything.  Plus, it becomes difficult to determine if things are being included that are no longer   necessary  the term tree-shaking refers to determining when an included dependency  is not actually being used, and that’s more difficult in this approach than what Webpack  does, as you’ll see . Aside from that, there is also sometimes code that shouldn’t be in the  bundle for other reasons, maybe because it’s only for development, or because it’s only  needed in specific versions of the page. Then, you’ll probably need to create some sort  of simple tooling  maybe just some shell scripts  to exclude things that aren’t necessary   and consider if you use a library like, say, React: what if there are parts of the library you   142   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  don’t use? It would be nice if you could leave those out and make the bundle smaller,  thereby improving load performance, wouldn’t it?   Further, when thinking of JavaScript, wouldn’t it be nice if you could use modules  to organize your code and know it would work across all browsers? That’s not the case  today: not all browser versions support them and those that do have some variances to  deal with. This is true whether you start from plain JavaScript or TypeScript, but with  TypeScript it’s more complicated because you have the compile step to worry about  as well. If you could organize your code with modules and not have to worry about  compiling your TypeScript, you’d have the best of all possible worlds, right?  For all these reasons, a good tool that can do bundling intelligently is a must, and   that’s where Webpack comes in.   What’s Webpack All About? Webpack isn’t the only bundler out there, but it has quickly become the de facto  standard and is, by probably most web developers, considered the best. Although it used  to have a reputation for not being exceptionally easy to work with, that has changed with  the latest version. It’s now quite easy to get started!  Webpack can do a lot more than merely bundling code, though. For example, it can  transpile TypeScript and even knows how to work with React and its .tsx files. So, in the  end, Webpack can be more than a bundler; it can be a right and proper and full-featured  build tool for your web applications. Most of this is optional and can be added on as you  need it, so at the start, Webpack is rather simple, but it is highly extensible so can meet  your needs every step of the way.  There are just a few core concepts that you must have at least a basic grasp of to use   Webpack with your applications.   Dependency Graph Start with a basic web page. You have an HTML file, one or more JavaScript files,  probably a stylesheet or two, and maybe some images. If you start with the HTML page,  it’s easy to understand that it depends on those JavaScript, stylesheet, and image files.  Sure, a browser can render that HTML without those things, but it may not look anything  like you expect without those additional resources.  143   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  When you tell Webpack to bundle your application, it looks at all the files it finds in   it  or that you explicitly name – we’ll see how to configure Webpack shortly . It examines  them and determines which files depend on which others. It builds what’s called a  dependency graph from that analysis, and with that, it can determine what needs to be  included, what can be dropped, what order things need to be in, and so on. Without  the dependency graph, nothing Webpack does would be possible, so while you won’t  be dealing with it directly in any way, it’s essential to understand that’s how Webpack is  doing its work on your behalf.  With it, though, Webpack can intelligently create bundles for you that have the   minimum amount of code required to make your web site or web app work like it should  while ensuring that it loads as efficiently as possible in the process.   Entry When Webpack builds the dependency graph, it’s constructing a tree structure under  the covers, and any tree structure must begin from a single point, or node, or in the case  of Webpack and web applications: a module. By default, Webpack will assume the entry  point is called . src index.js, relative to the directory it’s run in. But you, of course,  can name a different starting entry point, and we’ll see how to do that soon. Regardless,  from that starting point, the dependency graph is built as Webpack examines the entry  point and then recursively examines each file that it in any way depends on.   Output In the previous section, take note of the location of the default entry point: a src  directory  short for source, obviously . That’s the typical model that Webpack follows:  a src directory where all your unbundled source code lives. But where does Webpack  put your bundled code? The answer, by default, is a directory named dist  short for  distribution . Further, by default, the name of the bundle that will be created is main.js   most of the time, you’ll get a single bundle, and in fact for our discussions here, we’re  going to assume that’s all you ever get because multiple output bundles are a bit more  advanced of a topic and nothing we need to be concerned with for the purpose of this  book . All of this can be altered, of course, to ensure you get the output you want exactly  where you want it, but we’re just considering the default case right now and the basic  concepts.  144   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk   Loaders Once you know where your code starts, how Webpack will produce a dependency  graph from analyzing it, and where it will put the resultant bundle, it’s time to look at  the concept of loaders, which are components that transform dependencies in some  way. Out of the box, Webpack only understands one thing: JavaScript  well, it also  understands JSON files, but given that JSON is a subset, or component, of JavaScript,  it’s still really just one thing . To understand anything else, you need to specify a loader  for it. But, whether you use only the default JavaScript loader or add more, the job of a  loader is simple: to process some type of file and convert them into valid modules that  can be added to the dependency graph and ultimately to be bundled and consumed by  your application later.  A loader has two critical attributes associated with it: a test property and a use   property. The test property enables Webpack to determine which files it should  transform. The use property specifies what loader to use for it. When put together, a  rule is formed that Webpack will follow that basically says: “Hey, Webpack, when you  encounter a reference to a file whose path matches the test property, go ahead and  process that file with the loader specified by the use property, pretty please?”  As an example, say that you want to include images in your final bundle, and you   want those images to be Base64-encoded in JavaScript. Webpack can’t do this by default,  so you’ll need to add a loader, in this case, one called url-loader. To jump ahead a bit,  Webpack has a config file, just like TypeScript and NPM do. In it, you would add a rule:  module : {   rules : [     { test :  \. jpgpng $ , use : { loader : "url-loader" } }   ] }  Now, any time Webpack encounters a file in your src directory with an extension of  .jpg or .png, which will match the regex specified in the test property, it will use the url-  loader loader to encode it and add it to the bundle.  Don’t get hung up on those details, we’ll get into it all shortly, but that should give   you a good idea how loaders are used. And remember if all you have are JavaScript files,  then this isn’t necessary because Webpack knows how to handle those automatically.  145    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  Chapter 7   Plugins Plugins are another mechanism available to you in Webpack. Conceptually, they are  similar to loaders, but they serve a fundamentally different purpose, and that purpose is  virtually anything!  Need to optimize your bundle? Plugin! Need to insert some environment variables  into your bundle? Plugin! Need to add I18n resources to your bundle? Plugin! Want to  add some sort of copyright notice to the top of each generated bundle? Plugin!  I think you get the point! Like loaders, plugins require an entry in the Webpack configuration file that I briefly  mentioned earlier and that we’ll get into more soon. Webpack ships with a good number  of plugins, including the following:     BabelMinifyWebpackPlugin – Used for minification with babel-   minify  between chunks  expression  the build directory     BannerPlugin – Adds a banner to the top of each generated chunk     CommonsChunkPlugin – Extracts common modules shared      CompressionWebpackPlugin – Prepares compressed versions of   assets to serve them with Content-Encoding     ContextReplacementPlugin – Overrides inferred context of a require      CopyWebpackPlugin – Copies individual files or entire directories to      DefinePlugin – Allows global constants configured at compile time     DllPlugin – Splits bundles in order to drastically improve build time     EvalSourceMapDevToolPlugin – Enables a more fine-grained   control of eval source maps     ExtractTextWebpackPlugin – Extracts text  CSS  from your bundles      HotModuleReplacementPlugin – Enables Hot Module Replacement   into a separate file   HMR   146   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk     HtmlWebpackPlugin – Creates HTML files to serve your bundles          I18nWebpackPlugin – Adds i18n support to your bundles  IgnorePlugin – Excludes certain modules from bundles     LimitChunkCountPlugin – Sets min max limits for chunking     LoaderOptionsPlugin – Used for migrating from Webpack 1 to 2     MinChunkSizePlugin – Keeps chunk size above the specified limit     MiniCssExtractPlugin – Creates a CSS file per JS file     NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin – Skips emit phase on compilation errors     NormalModuleReplacementPlugin – Replaces resource s  that      NpmInstallWebpackPlugin – Auto-installs missing dependencies   matches a regex  during development     ProgressPlugin – Reports compilation progress     ProvidePlugin – Uses modules without having to use import require     SourceMapDevToolPlugin – Enables fine-grained control of source      TerserPlugin – Enables control of the version of Terser     UglifyjsWebpackPlugin – Enables control of the version of UglifyJS     ZopfliWebpackPlugin – Prepares compressed versions of assets with   maps  node-zopfli  You can also add all sorts of third-party plugins, but that’s a much larger   conversation that you may never need to have if the built-in ones are sufficient, but at  least now you know what to Google for if it comes up.   Modes Whenever Webpack performs a build, it can be done in one of several modes: development,  production, or none. Which mode is used determines which of the built- in plugins are  used, if any, and controls what options are passed to them to do their work. In simplest  terms, the mode determines what optimizations Webpack does to your bundles.  147   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  When the mode is none, as you might guess, it does no optimizations at all. When the mode is development, the NamedChunksPlugin and NamedModulesPlugin   are enabled. Also, the option process.env.NODE_ENV on the DefinePlugin is set to a  value of development  as the name implies, this is associated with using Webpack for  Node code, which you absolutely do if you want; Webpack isn’t necessarily just about  client-side code! .  When the mode is production, the process.env.NODE_ENV on DefinePlugin is again   set, but now the plugins FlagDependencyUsagePlugin, FlagIncludedChunksPlugin,  ModuleConcatenationPlugin, NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin, OccurrenceOrderPlugin,  SideEffectsFlagPlugin, and TerserPlugin are all enabled. The result is a much more  optimized bundle, as you would expect to have for a production release.  The mode of a Webpack build can be set in its configuration file, or it can be passed   in as a command-line argument, so you have flexibility in that.   Browser Compatibility In short, Webpack, by default, supports all ES5-compliant browsers  Internet Explorer 8   and lower are not supported . Webpack requires the Promise object to implement  import   statements and require.ensure   statements. You can still support older  browsers if you wish, but to do so requires loading a polyfill before using those sorts  of statements. There is a section in the Webpack documentation that discusses this at  webpack.org, but it’s a topic I won’t be covering here, I just wanted to make you aware of it.   Getting Started with Webpack Okay, enough with the theory, let’s get down to brass tacks and see Webpack in action!  To get started, create an empty directory somewhere and initialize a new NPM project:  Note  this is the first_example for this chapter in the source code for this book,   if you’re not following along  which i would frankly suggest you do rather than  just go directly to the existing source code so that you get a feel for doing all this  yourself .  npm init -y  148   Next, you’ll need to install Webpack itself. Let’s install it locally to this project so that   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  we can manage the dependency within the project:  npm install --save-dev webpack  Next, create a src directory, and in it, create a file named index.js. For the contents   of that file, write  let a = 2; let b = 5; let c = a * b; alert c ;  Okay, while that code is clearly nothing special and really doesn’t benefit from   Webpack, we can still bundle it with Webpack just fine, and at this point, we’re ready  to do just that! Because Webpack isn’t installed globally, we know that we can’t just  execute it straight away  if it was installed globally, you could simply execute webpack at  a command prompt right now . So, to execute it, we’ll have to use npx, as discussed in  Chapter 4:  npx webpack  When you do this, Webpack will request that you install the webpack-cli module,   and you should say yes to allow it since you won’t get much further than this if you don’t!  This is what will allow you to execute Webpack commands. You’ll only need to do this  the first time you execute Webpack.  Note  you should see a warning about the mode option not being set when you  execute this command. that’s okay! webpack will default to production mode if  you don’t set the mode in the configuration file or pass it on the command line as  previously discussed, and this is fine for our purposes here.  When this completes, you should find that you now have a dist directory, and    within it should be a main.js file. Recall from earlier that by default, Webpack looks for  src index.js as the entry point and creates dist main.js, and that’s precisely what we  see here, entirely without telling Webpack anything at all about our project.  149   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  Typically, you won’t care too much about what’s in the output file, but I think it’s   informative to see:  !function e {var t={};function r n {if t[n] return t[n].exports;var   o=t[n]={i:n,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[n].call o.exports,o,o.exports,r ,  o.l=!0,o.exports}r.m=e,r.c=t,r.d=function e,t,n {r.o e,t Object.define Property e,t,{enumerable:!0,get:n} },r.r=function e {"undefined"!=typeof  Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty e,Symbol.toStringTag,  {value:"Module"} ,Object.defineProperty e,"__esModule",{value:!0} },  r.t=function e,t {if 1&t&& e=r e  ,8&t return e;if 4&t&&"object"==typeof  e&&e&&e.__esModule return e;var n=Object.create null ;if r.r n ,Object.def ineProperty n,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e} ,2&t&&"string"!=typeof e  for var o in e r.d n,o,function t {return e[t]}.bind null,o  ;return n},  r.n=function e {var t=e&&e.__esModule?function  {return e.default}:  function  {return e};return r.d t,"a",t ,t},r.o=function e,t {return  Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call e,t },r.p="",r r.s=0 } [function e,t  {alert 10 }] ;  If nothing else, that proves that Webpack has definitely done some transformations   on our code because that doesn’t look even remotely like what we wrote! However, if  you start to dig through it, you can start to see how it related to the original code and  how it was optimized. For example, Webpack is smart enough to realize that the value of  variable c is always going to be 10, so it was optimized away and you can see in the final  alert   near the end how it has a hardcoded value of 10.  This is a crucial point to understand: in general, you’ll rarely look at the final bundle,  and you’ll even less commonly debug it. You effectively must trust that Webpack is doing  the right thing for you and that though it may look vastly different, the code it produces  does what your original code was intended to do. Yes, you might, at times, find that a  bug in Webpack  or a loader or plugin  is an issue, but just like with a compiler, you must  have a level of trust in the tooling.   Getting More Complex So far, we haven’t done any Webpack configuration at all, and instead we have just relied  on its default behavior. In a project of any real complexity, that’s likely not going to be  enough. So, let’s get into configuring Webpack. To do so, we’ll need a configuration file:  150   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  Note  this is the second_example for this chapter in the source code for this book.  npx webpack init  The result of this is an interactive process shown in Figure 7-1. In the end, we get a   file named webpack.config.js. But we actually get a lot more than that!  Figure 7-1.  The Webpack initialization process  As you can see, there are a series of questions you’re asked, beginning with whether   your application will have multiple bundles. As stated earlier, this is a bit of a more  advanced topic that I won’t be covering in this book, so a terse “no” is the right answer.  Then, we are asked for the entry point, and here I’ve just selected the default that is  presented, which is also the case for the folder to store the output in.  After that, you are asked whether your project will use ES6 or TypeScript. As you can  guess, for the projects in the subsequent chapters, we’ll be using TypeScript, but for now,  we’ll stick with plain old JavaScript, version ES6 in this case. We’re also asked about CSS  solutions, things like SASS or LESS, but we don’t need any of that here.  After that, it asks if it’s okay to overwrite a few files, and the answer is yes in all cases.   Typically, you likely wouldn’t have created the index.js file first, so there would be  no need to overwrite that, but in this case, there is. Also, if you had Webpack installed   151   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  globally, then you wouldn’t need to do the npm init step first either; you could go  directly to doing  webpack init  Since that also creates an NPM package.json file, it’s all you really need to do, but  it only works if Webpack is installed globally. Since in this case it’s not, we had to install  it first, hence why we did npm init first, and why Webpack now is asking to overwrite  package.json.  After that, an npm install is automatically executed to install all the dependencies   that Webpack added to package.json, all the things it needs to do its work.  And, then, it does that work! It processes our source file and generates a bundle  from it. But it does a lot more than that! Remember when we ran Webpack without a  configuration file? We got the output file as we expected, but we had no way to use it. At  that point, we would have created an HTML file to load the main.js file so we could see  our alert 10  as we expect. When you initialize a Webpack project like this, though,  Webpack, in effect, does that step for us behind the scenes. What’s more: it provides a  web server for it to run on! All you need to do, as seen in Figure 7-1, is execute  npm run start  That will start up a small web server and even launches the page in your default web  browser! Once it does, open your web developer tools, and you should see a message in  the console “Hello World from your main file!”  But, oops, we do not see the alert 10  as we should. That’s because we allowed   Webpack to overwrite the index.js file we originally wrote with a “starter” file, so to speak,  and as a result now we have an index.js with the following content:  console.log "Hello World from your main file!" ;  To get back to where we want to be, let’s now open that index.js file and copy into   it the example code from earlier. Do that, save the file, and watch what happens: like  magic, after a few seconds, the page automatically refreshes in the browser, and you  see the alert 10  message as we expect! What happened is that Webpack continues to  monitor the source files and when it seems them change it does a build automatically. It  then, also automatically, deploys the updated code to the web server, and thanks to the  code on the page it created for us, it refreshes the page for us.  152   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  At this point, I encourage you to also look at the code in your browser  using View   Source  to see the HTML file. Then, also be sure to look at the JavaScript file that it  references. I think you’ll be rather surprised what’s in there! It’s far beyond even the  already kind of verbose code we saw in the earlier example. But all of it is what allows  Webpack to perform all this magic for us. Again, you’ve got to trust your tools for things  like this; there’s little choice  I know that I would not want to debug the code I see there! .   Configuration When you executed the webpack init command, a file named webpack.config.js was  created. Let’s look now at that file  minus the comments, for brevity :  const path = require 'path' ; const webpack = require 'webpack' ;  const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require 'html-webpack-plugin' ;  module.exports = {   mode: 'development',   entry: '. src index.js',    output: {     filename: '[name].[chunkhash].js',     path: path.resolve __dirname, 'dist'    },    plugins: [     new webpack.ProgressPlugin  , new HtmlWebpackPlugin     ],    module: {     rules: [       {         test:  . jsjsx $ ,         include: [path.resolve __dirname, 'src' ],         loader: 'babel-loader',  153   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk          options: {           plugins: ['syntax-dynamic-import'],            presets: [             [               '@babel preset-env',               {                 modules: false               }             ]           ]         }       }     ]   },    optimization: {     splitChunks: {       cacheGroups: {         vendors: {           priority: -10,           test:  [\\ ]node_modules[\\ ]          }       },        chunks: 'async',       minChunks: 1,       minSize: 30000,       name: true     }   },    devServer: {     open: true   } };  154   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  This is code that will eventually be executed by Node on behalf of Webpack, so it   begins with imports to provide the node path module and the Webpack Node module  itself. The html-webpack-plugin module is then imported, which is the Webpack plugin  responsible for the creation of that HTML file that loads the finished bundle and allows  us to do real-time edits.  After that comes module.exports, the contents of which are targeted to Webpack  itself, to configure its operation. The mode property defines the mode of operation, as  previously discussed. As you can see, it defaults to development. The entry point is also  named, so if you wanted to change the source file that is the top of the dependency graph  tree, you could do it right there by simply providing the filename and relative path to it.  Next comes some configuration of the output, including where it goes  the dist   directory  and the name of the final bundle file. The name specified here is a little more  unusual than you would usually write yourself because when an automatic build is done,  that is when Webpack sees some changed source files, it produces a unique bundle  name so that caching in the browser doesn’t defeat the autoload mechanism. The [name]  and [chunkhash] are internal tokens that Webpack provides to ensure the filename is  unique on each rebuild  look at the JavaScript file imported into the generated HTML file  to see that in action .  Then comes the plugins property, which is an array of plugin objects. As you can  see, the html-webpack-plugin is instantiated  an instance of the HtmlWebpackPlugin  class, as defined in the associated source file  and added to the array. But before that  comes another plugin: webpack.ProgressPlugin. As you probably have surmised, this is  responsible for showing progress updates on the screen during build operations.  After that comes the module property. This allows you to tell Webpack how to build   your bundle. The goal here is to provide a set of rules. Each rule has a test, which is a regex  that matches one or more files. For each rule that matches, the loader s  specified will be  used to transform the files, and you can provide options for each loader. Here, we can see  that Webpack has added Babel to the mix and specified that any .js or .jsx file should be  handled by it. The configuration for the Babel loader should look somewhat familiar: you  can see the presets being used as we saw in previous chapters. In addition, a plugin is added  for this loader: the syntax-dynamic-import plugin. This is responsible for determining what  code can be left out of the bundle based on what is imported and what isn’t.  After that comes a section for the optimizations to apply. There are quite a few   options available here, and rather than echo the Webpack documentation, and I’ll  instead just point you in its direction: https:  webpack.js.org configuration  optimization. The one seen here, the splitChunks optimization, is actually   155   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  just configuration for the SplitChunksPlugin. The job of this plugin is to ensure  duplicate resources aren’t included. For example, if two modules reference a third,  the dependency graph would have the third module listed twice. At bundle time, you  wouldn’t want it to be included twice, though. This plugin, and the configuration for  it here, avoids that. For further details on its configuration, see the documentation.  However, it should be noted that the default configuration is expected to be sufficient for  most projects, so in reality this is mostly boilerplate that you can ignore unless and until  a time comes where you need to dig into the details.  Finally, the devServer property is what is responsible for enabling the built-in web   server function, as well as monitoring for source file changes.  Quite honestly, even this configuration is more than you might need. But that’s   the beautiful thing about Webpack: it is highly configurable, so when a need arises, a  quick trip to the documentation is all that’s likely to be required to find just the right  configuration you need.   Using Modules So far, the examples we’ve looked at have been straightforward JavaScript examples.  What happens though when we want to use more advanced concepts like modules? As  you’re aware from previous chapters, modules aren’t universally supported across all  browsers. Not only that but there are several competing module formats available, and  they aren’t usually interoperable.  This is where Webpack really starts to earn its keep.  Note  this is the third_example for this chapter in the source code for this book.  To see it in action, let’s take the second example and modify it. First, replace index.  js with the following:  import getA from ". module1"; import getB from ". module2";  alert getA   * getB   ;  Next, create a file in the src directory named module1.js and in it put this:  export default function getA   { return 20; }  156   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  Finally, create a file named module2.js, again in the src directory, and in it put  export default function getB   { return 30; }  Now, as you do this, if you happened to have executed npm run start and didn’t   stop it, you should see that Webpack is dutifully rebuilding as you go. Probably you will  have seen some build failures along the way if you did things in the order I said here,  and that’s fine. If you edit index.js first, Webpack will try to build it, but won’t be able  to find module1.js and module2.js yet. Hence, you’ll get a build error. That’s fine and  completely expected.  Ultimately though, once you’ve made the change to index.js and added the   other two files, you should get a successful build  or, if Webpack wasn’t monitoring,  just execute npm run start again . Either way, you should get the page launched in  your browser, and you should see an alert   message showing 600, proving that both  modules were bundled together with the entry point, and everything works as we expect  it to.  That demonstrates how modules can be used and how Webpack will resolve them  correctly and bundle them. It also shows that this will now work across browsers, even  on those that don’t know about modules. This is arguably the real power of Webpack  because now you can organize your code well using modules and know that it’s going to  work across all browsers  or Node, if this isn’t code that you’ll be running in a browser .   Wither TypeScript? As a final topic, let’s talk about how we could use TypeScript instead of plain old  JavaScript. We’ll take the third example from before and change the three source files to  TypeScript.  Note  this is the fourth_example for this chapter in the source code for this book.  To start, we need to add TypeScript itself to the project, and we also need to  introduce a new loader for Webpack to know how to work with TypeScript, the   ts- loader. Begin by installing both:  npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader  157   Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  Next, we need to initialize a TypeScript project, and you know how to do that already,   but remember, with TypeScript installed in the project, we’ll need to use npx:  npx tsc -init  work for this example.  That gives us the tsconfig.json file that Webpack needs, and its default form should   if we had initialized the webpack project with typeScript support from the   Tip  beginning, then this would have been done for us already, but since we’re building  on the previous project, we can’t do that  well, we could re-initialize the project  as we did earlier, but as you now know, that would overwrite a bunch of files,  and this time we want to avoid that to show the progression of adding additional  capabilities to the project on the fly .  After that, we must tell Webpack to use the ts-loader. To do that, go into the   webpack.config.js file and look for this chunk:  {   test:  . jsjsx $ ,   include: [path.resolve __dirname, 'src' ],   loader: 'babel-loader',    options: {     plugins: ['syntax-dynamic-import'],      presets: [       [         '@babel preset-env',         {           modules: false         }       ]     ]   } }  158   That’s the module configuration that Webpack created for us earlier. Replace it with this:  Chapter 7    tying it Up in a Bow: weBpaCk  {   test:  \.ts?$ ,   use: 'ts-loader',   exclude:  node_modules , }  Now, Webpack is ready to deal with .ts files and knows to ignore the node_modules  directory. Getting some .ts files to work with is the next step! Go into the src directory  and change the three files there from .js extensions to .ts extensions. Since, as you’ll  recall, all valid JavaScript is all valid TypeScript, that should be all we have to do.  But, in fact, there is one more thing we need to do it turns out: in the  now  index.ts    file, update the imports to specify module1.ts and module2.ts  just adding the  extensions . Failing to do that will result in a compilation failure saying the modules  can’t be found. It’s a minor change, but a change none the less.  With all that done, if you still have Webpack monitoring for changes, then you should   have a clean build, and the page should have refreshed and shown the proper alert    message. If not, do npm run start again and make sure everything works as expected.  That’s all it takes to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript! Now you can use all the  goodness you learned about in the previous two chapters in TypeScript land to make  your projects that much more robust!  And, with that, you now know all the basics about Webpack that you need to build   most applications. To be sure, there’s much more to Webpack, and indeed you could  read an entire book on it and all the options it provides, and I would definitely encourage  you to at some point! It’s a potent tool that will serve you well if you learn more about  it. But this  plus some other things we’ll see in later chapters  covers the bases that any  project of virtually any complexity will use, and that’s the point: building a foundation.   Summary In this chapter, we looked at Webpack. You learned what it is, the basic concepts  underlying it, how to install it, how to create a basic project with it, and how to configure  it, at least at a basic level.  And, with that, we now have all the tools we need to start building our project! When   you’re ready, jump on into the next chapter so we can start having some fun!  159   CHAPTER 8  Delivering the Goods:  MailBag, the Server  Alright! The stage is set, the players at the ready, and the houselights dimmed… It’s time  to draw the curtains and start the show!  In this chapter, and the next three, it’s time to take all you’ve learned in the preceding   chapters and put it to use building some real apps! For each, we’ll build a server  component with Node, and a client component with React, but that’s about where the  similarities end. These will be quite different apps from one another, and each will  use a host of supporting technologies to do its thing. We’ll use different techniques,  approaches, and architectures so that you’ll gain as wide a field of view as possible of  what modern full-stack application development looks like in the real world.   What Are We Building? The first application will be dubbed MailBag. This is a generic term for a particular  type of bag typically used for collecting, carrying, categorizing, and classifying different  types of postal material. If you’ve ever seen your friendly neighborhood spider… err,  mailman… carrying a bag with mail around, that’s a mailbag. If you’ve ever seen an old  John Wayne western with a guy riding a horse carrying a bag with mail, that too is a…  wait for it… MAILBAG!  In our case, though, there are no horses involved and no postal materials. No,   instead, what we’re concerned with is digital mail, electronic mail, or email! Squish the  two words together to form MailBag, and what we have is an email application or, as it’s  more commonly known, a webmail system. That’s what we’re building!    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_8  161    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Chapter 8   Basic Requirements Any time you build an application, it helps to have a list of requirements. So, let’s make  such a list for MailBag. Understand that we’re not out to exactly copy Gmail or Outlook  Mail or any of the other well-known webmail systems out there. No, we’re going to  build just a small subset of what those offer, but we’ll cover what are probably the most  essential elements, and we’ll choose them such that they allow us to build a good,  useful, and, most critical for you the reader, educational application while not being  overwhelming in its scope:     MailBag will be in two parts: a server, which will act as a proxy and  will be what communicates with a mail server somewhere, and the  client, which will talk to our server to do its work.     The MailBag server will communicate with an email server whose  details will be stored in a text file on the MailBag server  so this is a  single-user system , and it will communicate with that email server  via the popular IMAP protocol for retrieving mail  sorry POP3 users!   and SMTP for sending messages.     The MailBag server will provide an API to the client that allows it to   get a list of mailboxes for the account, a list of messages for a selected  mailbox, and pertinent message details for display by the client.   It will allow the user to delete and send messages. Finally, the server  will provide for storage of contacts and the associated add and delete  functions for maintaining them.     This chapter is all about the server, so details about the client will   come in the next chapter. However, in high-level terms, it helps to have  a picture in your mind. I’m sure you’ve seen a webmail application like  Gmail before, and MailBag will be no different fundamentally.   The client will be a web-based application that can be viewed in any web  browser. It will provide the user a list of mailboxes in their account,  the ability to see a list of messages within a selected mailbox, and the  ability to choose and view a message, as well as delete it. It will also,  of course, allow the user to compose and send a new message to an  entered email address. We’ll also give them a list of contacts that they  can add people to  and remove from  and initiate an email too quickly.  162   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  For now, that’s all we need to know. It’s helpful sometimes, when doing full-stack   development, to use this sort of “tunnel vision” approach: we at this point aren’t  concerned with the client beyond the broad strokes here. Instead, you begin by thinking  primarily about just the API your client needs first, and then you worry about building  the client itself later. When the two are combined, you get the complete MailBag  application. But that’s all much easier to do when you aren’t overwhelming yourself by  trying to look at the whole thing as one big entity. As I said, a little tunnel vision can be a  good thing, so we’ll break this into two parts and attack each separately.   Setting Up the Project To get started with MailBag, we’ll create a directory that will be the root of our project.  Since there are two components to this, a client and a server, we’ll then create a client  directory and a server directory, and within each of those, we’ll create a src directory  and a dist directory. Each of the client and server directories constitutes a separate  project that we can work with individually, and each has a set of course files, obviously,  and a directory where the compiled files will go  dist, short for distribution . The src  directory is where our source files will be found, and dist is where the compiled  read:  executable  files will go after compilation.  Once that’s done, navigate to the server directory from a command line. Since we’re  building a Node project, and since most Node projects are NPM projects, the first step it  to initialize an NPM project:  Just accept all the default values, perhaps just providing a name like “server” or even   “MailBag server,” whatever you like, it’s not critical.  Now, since we know we want to write out code in TypeScript, let’s go ahead and   install TypeScript itself as a dev dependency:  npm install –save-dev typescript  You can ensure TypeScript is now available by executing tsc from a command prompt. D’oh! It doesn’t work! That’s right, you must use npx to execute it when installed local to the project directory:  npm init  npx tsc  163   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  That should work now, displaying basic usage information. Next, let’s initialize this as a TypeScript project too:  npx tsc -init  After that, you should have not only the package.json file but also the package-   lock.json and tsconfig.json files.  Now, we have to make a few tweaks to the tsconfig.json file, specifically the following:     Uncomment the "outDir" element and set its value to ". dist".    We want all our compiled files to go into a dist subdirectory.     After the "compilerOptions" element, add "include":    [ "src ** *" ]. So, the file should have this form when you’re done:  {   "compilerOptions": {     ...lots of compiler options...   },   "include": [ "src ** *" ] }  This will ensure that tsc only tries to compile files in the src directory.     Although not necessary, also uncomment the "sourceMap" option   and ensure it’s set to true, to make debugging easier.  And, at its most basic level, that’s the entire development environment!   Source File Rundown Now that the basic project structure is set up, let’s talk about the relatively small handful  of source files, again found in the  server src directory, that will constitute the server  codebase. We’ll look at each file in turn, but for a quick summary, they will be as  follows:      main.ts – This will be the main entry point and is where we’ll define  the functions that will constitute the API the server presents to the  client  much more on this in the next section! .  164   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server                  ServerInfo.ts – This will be a configuration file that provides details  about the IMAP and SMTP server s  the server will connect to and  where that information will be stored.  IMAP.ts – Code that talks to an IMAP server to list mailboxes and  messages and to retrieve messages. There will be a Worker class  within this. That is what the rest of our application code will use,  along with some interfaces we’ll need.  SMTP.ts – Code that talks to an SMTP server to send messages. Like  IMAP, this will have a Worker class.  contacts.ts – Code dealing with contacts  listing, adding, and  deleting them . Once again, a Worker class will be present, along with  an interface to describe a contact object.  In addition to those, we’ll have that configuration file I mentioned for IMAP and   SMTP server information stored in the  server directory named serverInfo.json. We’ll  get into that soon.  That, aside from the NPM Node and TypeScript config files, is all there is to the   server codebase. It’s not much, but it gets the job done.   Adding Node Modules The next step is to add the modules and library dependencies we’re going to use. There  are only five of them, but they’re key to the whole thing! We’re going to go over each in  some detail later, but for now, let’s get them added:  npm install --save emailjs-imap-client npm install --save express npm install --save mailparser npm install --save nedb npm install --save nodemailer  Just to give you a preview, emailjs-imap-client will provide all the IMAP functionality   we need; express will allow us to build our API quickly and easily; mailparser will be  needed to gain access to the actual content of a message; nedb will provide us some data  storage capabilities; and nodemailer will provide the message-sending SMTP capabilities.  165    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Chapter 8   Adding Types Adding dependencies is all well and good, but since we’re using TypeScript and not plain  old JavaScript, we want TypeScript bindings for them, too, assuming they are available. That begs the question: how do you tell if there are TypeScript bindings for a given   library? Well, you can certainly just randomly try to install them:  npm install --save-dev @types express  Almost always, @types XXX, where XXX is the name of the library, will work. But not   always. There must be a better way to tell, right? Indeed, there is definitelytyped.org. This  is a web site that, among other things, provides a simple search interface, as you can see  in Figure 8-1.  Figure 8-1.  The definitelytyped.org search engine  166   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  As you can see, there are several possible matches, so you can then click one to see if   it’s what you need. The first one is almost certainly what we’re looking for, so clicking it  reveals Figure 8-2.  Figure 8-2.  Clicking a link from the search engine brings you to a detail page on  npmjs.com  Ah, that’s the right one! I’ll save you the time hunting down the others and tell you that the commands you   need to execute, in addition to the Express one previously shown, are  npm install --save-dev @types mailparser npm install --save-dev @types nedb npm install --save-dev @types node npm install --save-dev @types nodemailer  167   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Remember that the type bindings are only relevant at development time, not  runtime, hence, why --save-dev is used. Also note that at the time of this writing,  there was no binding available for emailjs-imap-client. This will cause us some minor  trouble later, as you’ll see, but nothing too significant. Finally, note that Node itself has  TypeScript bindings, and we’ll, of course, want those for sure!   A More Convenient Development Environment At this point, you can compile the source code  err, assuming there was source code in  the src directory that is!  with tsc. But then, of course, you’d need to start up the server  to do anything with it. Assuming main.ts was our main entry point  hint: it is! , then after  compiling we’d find a main.js file in dist, so we could start it up easy enough, assuming  we were in the server directory:  node . dist main.js  But that’s not all that convenient: we need to manually compile when we change  a source file and then manually start the server  and manually shut it down first if it’s  already running . There’s gotta be an easier way, right? Yes, there is!  In our package.json file, there’s a scripts section. Here, we can provide NPM   commands that we’ll be able to use on the command line, associated with what they do.  In simplest terms, you define a command and then tell NPM what the command line  would be if you were doing it manually.  Let’s say we want to have a command that will compile all our source code and then   start up the server. That’s easy enough:  scripts: { "compile" : "npx tsc && node . dist main.js" }  Note that you might have to adjust it for your particular operating system, but   ultimately, the value of the "compile" key is what you would manually do: execute npx  tsc, followed by executing node . dist main.js to recompile the source files and start  up the server.  This alone, though, would be problematic if the server was already running. You   would need to shut it down yourself first, still manually. And, plus, we again must  manually execute this command  which you can do with npm run compile , which is  only slightly better.  168   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  To solve this problem, we’ll add one more development dependency:  npm install --save-dev nodemon  Nodemon is a handy module that can monitor your JavaScript source files for  changes and automatically restart the app when any are detected. Now, we can do  node . node_modules nodemon bin nodemon.js . dist main.js  After that, any time main.js changes, nodemon will see that and restart it. That for  sure is better, but we can do even better! Let’s add a second script, so that the scripts  element in package.json is now this:  "scripts": {   "compile": "npx tsc && node . dist main.js",    "dev": "node . node_modules nodemon bin nodemon.js -e ts --exec \"npm run   compile\""  }  What we’ve done is added a dev command that used nodemon. But, in contrast   to before, we now add an argument to nodemon, the -e option. By default, nodemon  watched for changes in .js, .mjs, .coffee, .litcoffee, and .json files. With -e though,  we can tell it to watch other types of tiles, .ts files in this case. The --exec option is used  to tell nodemon what to do when those files change, so now any time nodemon sees  changes to our TypeScript source files, it will execute the compile command.  With that all in place, if we execute npm run dev, nodemon will begin monitoring   our source TypeScript files. When any change, it will compile them and then start up the  resultant main.js file. Now, we’ve got ourselves a nice little workflow: we can happily  peck away at our source files, and then compile and restart will be automatic, making  our work quicker and our life easier!  Note  if compiler errors occur, nodemon will still try to start up the app because it  doesn’t know not to. that obviously isn’t going to go well, so you need to keep an  eye on your console when you make changes to ensure they’re valid and running  when you expect them to be.  169   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   The Starting Point: main.ts Okay, now that we have our development environment and our project directories all set  up, we can finally start to hack some code together!  That is, we would be able to, if we didn’t have a few short detours to make along the   way first! There are a few concepts we need to discuss before getting to the code, but  it won’t take long, I promise! Once that’s done, we can get to the main.ts file, which is  where our application begins.   A Quick Detour: Time to Take a REST REpresentational State Transfer  REST  is a set of principles that, when combined,  describe how common standards, HTTP usually, can be used to define a remote system  interface in a client-server system. Although REST can work over other protocols, in  practice it is rarely used with anything but HTTP. REST is a programming and operating  system-neutral architecture. It really is just a set of best practices, or patterns, and it’s  not even all that rigid! But what it allows you to do is to create a web-based API in a  de facto, standard way. In fact, the World Wide Web is an implementation of the REST  architectural style, whether you know it or not!  The underlying concept is that of resources. In the REST world, a resource is an   abstract concept that coherently and meaningfully can be represented in a form that can  be transmitted over HTTP. A bank account, a user record, a product description, and a  student list for a class described in JSON, XML, or even plain-text document form are all  valid examples of resources. This document form represents the state of a thing, whether  it’s the current state  when a client retrieves the resources from a server  or an updated  state  a new version of a resource a client sends to a server . The client initiates a “state  transition” by requesting a representation of a resource from a server or sending a new  representation to the server. When this design is used, the API presented to clients is said  to be RESTful.  Perhaps the primary benefit of REST is its simplicity and reduction of overhead.   Rather than complex XML messages that must be created and parsed on both sides of  the conversation, simpler data formats, most notably JSON, are typically used. These  formats are generally easier to create and consume, though at the cost of less rigidity,  which is sometimes a problem in terms of validation.  170   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Three components go into the idea of REST. One is the matter of URLs and how   you use them to address a given resource or collection of resources. The other is HTTP  methods and their meaning. The third is the data format representation of an addressed  resource against which you are acting. Let’s look at each of these concerns individually.   URLs for Fun and Profit  Simply put, a URL allows you to identify a thing, or set of things, with which you want to  interact. In the REST world, a URL identifies a resource or a collection of resources. Of  course, you know all about URLs, because you use them every day in your browser. You  also know about resources, even if you don’t realize that you do, because a web page  itself is a type of resource.  With REST, your URLs will nearly always refer to nouns. For example, let’s say your  web site is www.mysite.com. Given that, in the REST world, the URL www.mysite.com  users might refer to the collection of users available on your web site. The  users  portion is the resource in which you’re interested. If you were using such a RESTful API,  you would expect to get back a list of users and some data about them  putting aside the  question of data format for the moment .  What if, instead, you want to retrieve information about a specific user with the   username bill_gates? The URL, in that case, might be as follows:  Note that, unlike the more typical URLs you see associated with web pages, you    www.mysite.com users bill_gates  aren’t using query string parameters.   www.mysite.com?user=bill_gates  Instead of something like that, the parts of the URL path itself serve the same   purpose. The critical thing to note here is that we don’t deal with verbs in the URL. In  other words, you don’t write this:   www.mysite.com users add  The word add is a verb, which makes this a non-RESTful URL. Only nouns go into the   URL because nouns describe things or states of things. The verbs, the action to perform  on the specified resource, are determined by the HTTP method.  171   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Note  although i’ve shown it here, when you see a restful api described,  you will usually see it shown without the domain name: just  users,  users  bill_gates, or  users add, for example. the domain name is still necessary,  of course, to ensure that the reference to the specific resource is unique across the  entire internet.   Giving Methods Meaning  HTTP methods are the set of values valid in an HTTP method header attribute. When  you launch www.google.com in your browser, for example, you are making an HTTP GET  request, where GET is the method. If you were to sniff the traffic, as I’ve done in Figure 8- 3,  you could see the requests and the GET method associated with them  the initial request  is for www.google.com, then the subsequent requests are for the resources that page   then loads .  Figure 8-3.  Sniffing some HTTP traffic  172   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  With a RESTful interface, the most common HTTP methods, namely, GET, POST,   PUT, and DELETE, are given specific meanings:     GET – Retrieve a resource  or resources . GET is the only method   considered “safe,” meaning it doesn’t result in a data change on the  server.     POST – Create a new resource  unsafe .     PUT – Update an existing resource  unsafe .     DELETE – Delete an existing resource  unsafe .  Now, if you go out on the Web and look up REST, you may see some different  meanings for these methods, typically for POST and PUT. Sometimes you’ll see it  stated that PUT is for both create and updates of a single resource while POST is for  multiple updates. Sometimes you’ll also see it said that you should use POST for both.  Another school of thought is that POST should be for things that don’t precisely fit  the REST model, like a user login request. Any of these approaches are valid because  they still adhere to the underlying REST principle of URLs addressing resources, HTTP  methods describing actions, and a representation of the current state of an object being  transitioned to or from. There is flexibility in the interpretation of REST; that’s the point.   Data Format Smackdown  The third part of the REST trifecta is that of state and representing that state. When we  talk about state, we mean either the current state of a given resource or the future state  of it. When you make a GET request, you are requesting the current state of the resource.  When you POST, PUT, or DELETE the resource, the client is saying what the future state  of the resource should be after the operation completes.  When you perform a GET or DELETE, all the information required to complete the   operation is specified as part of the URL and HTTP header. The method is in the header,  and the resource is in the URL, whether it refers to a collection of resources  perhaps    users  or a single resource  maybe  users bill_gates . When you perform a PUT or  POST, there will usually be more information to be transmitted. For a user, that might   be the username and password. In those cases, the data is transmitted in the body   of the HTTP request. Similarly, when you GET a resource, the transmitted state is also   in the body.  173   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  What form will the data you transmit to the server, or the data the server returns to  you, take? The short answer is it can be in any format that can be sent via HTTP, and it  will still be valid REST. However, JSON is by far the most common state representation  format. The reason for this is most likely that producing and consuming JSON in  JavaScript in a browser is trivial, and this is what most RESTful APIs are accessed from.  JSON is inherently a simple data format that, even if you had to write code to produce  it by hand, is extremely easy to do  usually no more complicated than calling JSON. stringify x  for object x, and similarly, JSON.parse x  where x is some JSON, to get  an actual object . It’s simpler than XML, and it doesn’t require a unique XML-based  language, such as SOAP  Simple Object Access Protocol, the format used for classic non-  RESTful web services .  The downside to JSON is that it isn’t very rigid about data types and structure. While   there have been attempts to produce something along the lines of XML schemas for  JSON, the idea being that you can validate a JSON document against its schema, they  haven’t met with much success. In part, this is because JSON is hugely flexible, and that  flexibility plus its simplicity is desirable.  Whether you use JSON or not, any HTTP request, whether going to or coming from   the server, should specify the Content-Type header so that the receiver of the state  representation knows how to handle it. Sometimes this handling will be automatic, and  it will happen without you specifically coding for it because of the library you used to  make your remote calls.  There is a debate about what the response for the various HTTP methods should   be for methods other than GET  which is self-evident . When you DELETE a resource,  what should be returned? Some say that the resource deleted should be returned, while  others say that some sort of simple indicator that the operation was successful should  be displayed. Similarly, when you POST a new resource, do you get back the unique  resource identifier that you would use to GET the resource? Alternatively, is a copy of the  resource you sent in echoed back? Perhaps just a simple “OK” identifier would suffice?  You’ll see the choices that I made for this project soon, but it’s ultimately a question  you’ll need to answer for yourself because, as with the meaning of the HTTP methods,  there is no “one-size-fits-all” answer.   A Bonus Pillar: Response Status Codes  Although I said there were three main pillars of REST, in a sense, there’s a fourth: what  type of HTTP status code your API gives back for various operations.  174   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Setting an appropriate response code on the server for your clients can be a crucial  component to making the interaction as smooth as possible. Once again, you can come  up with some different meanings and still be doing valid REST. There is somewhat less  debate, however, on what the meanings of various response codes should be and how  they should be used, if you’re going to use them at all. Sometimes, you’ll encounter  services that give back an HTTP 200 for anything that’s not an outright error. That’s  perfectly acceptable, but it perhaps isn’t the most useful approach.  The following list summarizes probably the most common meaning for the various   HTTP status responses:     200 – OK: This response code indicates a successful operation.   Usually, this would be used when you DELETE a resource or PUT  changes to a resource.     201 – CREATED: This response code is frequently used for POST   creation of a new resource.     400 – BAD REQUEST: This response code is usually used to indicate   that the data format sent when PUT updating or POST creating a  resource was invalid or malformed in some way  500 is frequently  used instead of 400 .     401 – UNAUTHORIZED: This response code is used to indicate that  you need to authenticate before performing the requested operation.     405 – METHOD NOT ALLOWED: This response code is used when   the requested HTTP method isn’t supported  e.g., perhaps in a  read-only interface, you wouldn’t support POST or PUT, and 500 is  frequently used instead of this .     500 – INTERNAL SERVER ERROR: This response code is generally   used when some sort of error occurs that is not covered by the  previous scenarios.  In general, the response codes fall into fairly well-defined ranges: codes 100–199   are considered “informational” responses, things the client may want to know but  which aren’t critical to the API’s functionality; 200–299 represent successful responses   while 200 is most common, there are others that are useful, such as 201 Created and  202 Accepted – it’s just a question of how detailed you want your API to be for your  clients ; 300–399 represent redirect conditions of some sort, which may or may not need   175   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  to be handled by a client; 400–499 are for client errors, 400 Bad Request if they passed  in invalid request parameters, for example, or 401 Not Authorized if you have security  set up and the client isn’t allowed to make the request; and 500–599 represent various  types of server errors, whether a generic 500 Internal Server Error or perhaps 501 Not  Implemented if an HTTP method was requested that your services don’t support. You  can dig into the many codes online and determine if you want to use more specific codes  in various situations – there are many to choose from!  Now you know the core concepts behind REST. Now, let’s talk a bit about how   you might write the code of a RESTful API on the server using a popular Node library:  Express.  Note  For the sake of simplicity, MailBag will forego using codes as shown in the  preceding text and just return 200s in all non-error cases.   Another Quick Detour: Express, for Fun and Profit Express  https:  expressjs.com , which is perhaps the most popular Node module  around, is a minimal framework for creating web applications that offers developers a  set of robust features that eliminates a lot of boilerplate-type code from your application  code. Express offers a broad set of APIs, utility methods, and what it calls middleware to  provide many of the everyday things modern web applications need. Being a minimal, thin  framework means that Express delivers excellent performance on top of everything else.  Express is especially useful for, but is in no way specific to, writing RESTful API code.   If you look back to Chapter 2, where you saw the basic for a web server in node, you’ll  notice that there’s no mention of HTTP methods there. In fact, every request of any  type will be handled by the one callback function supplied. That means if you want to  implement a RESTful service, that callback will need to interrogate the request object,  determine the HTTP method, and then branch accordingly. That’s not especially difficult  to do, but it’s code you have to write yourself, which can get messy. Then, since REST is  based on URL structure, you’ll need to write code to parse the URL to figure out what  resource to deal with. Again, it’s not rocket science, but it’s work you must do yourself.  176   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Using Express avoids all of that. Instead, you write code like this:  const app = express  ; app.get " cars :vin", function inRequest, inResponse  {      Return a car object with the specific VIN number } ; app.listen 8080 ;  Here, you create an Express application instance, which is the basis of everything   you do with Express. Then, you tell the app that for a GET request to a URL in the form    cars :vin, execute the given function. The :vin part of the URL tells Express that after    cars in the URL will come a value that you want to have presented in the collection  of parameters that Express parses out of the URL, and you want to name it vin  which  you can then access in the function by doing inRequest.params.vin . In case you are  unaware, VIN is short for “Vehicle Identification Number,” and it’s a unique number that  identifies every car manufactured. So, assuming you have a database of VIN numbers, a  GET request to this URL can return an object representing the car associated with the VIN  number specified. Finally, you just have to start up the Express app by telling it what port  to listen on. That’s it! No parsing the URL yourself, no handling different request methods,  not even creating a server yourself. Express takes care of all those details for you!  You can, of course, specify handlers for all the other HTTP methods, and you can do   whatever you like in the function, return whatever you want, set the status code as you  see fit, and so on.  As with everything we’ve talked about so far, there’s quite a bit more that Express   can do, and you’ll see some of it in the server code here, but we’ll just be scratching the  surface. Express is a potent tool in the Node toolbox for sure!   Back to the Code! Okay, so finally, here we are, looking at the code in main.ts! It begins boringly enough:  Note  For all the source code listings in this chapter and the next three, all  comments have been removed from the code, and the code may have been  condensed and reformatted a bit to save some space on the printed page. the actual  executable code is the same in the book as in the source code bundle, though.  177   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  import path from "path"; import express,   { Express, NextFunction, Request, Response } from "express"; import { serverInfo } from ". ServerInfo"; import * as IMAP from ". IMAP"; import * as SMTP from ". SMTP"; import * as Contacts from ". Contacts"; import { IContact } from ". Contacts";  We have several things to import, and we’ll get to what each of them is as each is  encountered in the code. Note, though, that the first two imports are for a core Node  module  path  and Express and some Express-related things. The remaining four are  application imports, code that we’ll be writing. The first real code after the imports is this:  const app: Express = express  ;  That creates our Express app, as discussed in the previous section. Now, it’s time to  add some middleware to Express, that is, some additional bits of functionality that we  need our Express app to use:  app.use express.json   ;  This middleware takes care of parsing incoming request bodies that contain JSON,   as many of ours will. Our application code will, thanks to this middleware, receive a  JavaScript object resulting from the incoming data, saving us the hassle of parsing it  ourselves.  Next, we have to think about what this server has to do. First, of course, it will need  to provide RESTful endpoints that our client application can call on to do its work. But  it has to do something else: it needs to serve our client code to a browser that requests  it. When we discussed Express earlier, I mentioned that while it’s great for writing REST  APIs, that’s not all it’s good for. It can also act as a basic web server  which makes sense  given you know Node itself can do that on its own!  and enabling that is very simple:  app.use " ",   express.static path.join __dirname, ".. .. client dist"    ;  178   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  The static middleware is another built-in middleware that Express provides for   serving static resources. All you need to do is tell it where those resources are, and any  requests that come in that map to those requests will be served. We haven’t built those  resources yet – that’s what the next chapter is all about – but given the directory structure  we created, you know they must be in the client directory, and further you can assume  that they’re in a dist directory, just like the server is. We need a proper full path to this  directory, though, which is where that path module comes in to play, and specifically  its join   method. Here, we use a built-in variable that node supplies, __dirname, which  is the name of the directory the current script is in, and combine that with a relative  path pointing to the client dist directory. The path.join   method will take care of  disambiguating all of that, and we’ll wind up with a fully qualified path, complete with  proper separators for the current operating system, that is passed to express.static  , and  that’s all it takes to make Express act as a web server for our soon-to-be-built client code.  Next, we need to play one little trick to make our REST functions later work:  app.use function inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response, inNext: NextFunction  {   inResponse.header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*" ;   inResponse.header "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",     "GET,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS"    ;   inResponse.header "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",     "Origin,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept"    ;   inNext  ; } ;  The problem is that if you try to execute any of the REST endpoints that we’ll   be adding next, you’ll run into a CORS  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  limitation,  depending on how you make the call. For example, if you want to just load the client  later directly from the file system, without it being served from the server  which is  precisely how I was doing development most of the time! , then you will run smack into  a CORS limitation and not be able to do so. CORS is a security mechanism built into  web browsers that ensures that only certain domains can call your REST services. If you  were on the job and writing a REST service, you may only want your clients to be able  to call it, not anyone in the world. CORS protects you from that by forcing you to specify   179   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  the domains that you’ll accept calls from. This can also come into play if you want to call  a REST service from a web page you loaded from your file system, which is a common  thing to do during development. It can also come into play if you want to make requests  using a tool for testing REST services, something we’ll talk about later in this chapter. In  many of these cases, CORS will, by default, result in your calls being rejected, which is  good for security but awful for development!  CORS depends on several headers, provided by the server to clients, that all begin   with Access-Control-Allow. The browser will interrogate the server before making a  request to get these headers, and the values determine what the browser will or won’t be  allowed to do.  To begin, rather than having to specify specific domains to allow  since I don’t know   them! , CORS has a catch-all setting that will enable you to make calls from anywhere.  The way it works is that the server must return a header Access-Control-Allow-Origin  that lists the domains that can call it. If the value of that header is an asterisk, then the  browser will allow the call regardless of where it’s launched from. This, as it happens, is  precisely what we want! So, adding this little bit of custom middleware ensures that all  requests to our Express server will be allowed.  But that’s not all there is to it! We also have to determine what HTTP methods we’ll  allow. Without doing so, CORS will again stop our requests even though we allow them  from any domain. That’s where the second line comes into play. The Access-Control-  Allow-Methods header is where we list what HTTP methods we’ll accept from clients.  Finally, we need to also tell CORS what additional headers we’re going to accept, and   this is done with the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header. Specifically, for MailBag,  the Content-Type header is sent by the client to indicate that content is JSON  for the  operation where we’re sending an email or adding a contact, as you’ll see later .   But I added a few other headers that are typically needed as well. The point is you can  determine what is needed for your services and configure these headers as appropriate  for your use case.  Writing custom middleware, which is what this bit of code is doing, is a simple matter  of supplying a function to the app.use   method. When you do something like express. json   from earlier, it is, in fact, passing a function to app.use  . In this case, though,  we must supply our own. This function must have a specific structure; it is passed the  incoming request, the generated response, and a reference to the next function.  You see, when Express handles a request, all the middleware that was registered   with the app via the app.use   calls forms a chain. Each is executed in turn. So, it makes   180   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  sense that each link in the chain must execute the next to keep the chain going  or it  might also abort the request, if that’s necessary . That’s why after setting the header on  the request object, our custom middleware function calls inNext  . That continues the  chain, so the request can continue to be processed as required.   REST Endpoint: List Mailboxes  With those preliminaries out of the way, we can begin to add the various endpoints our  service must provide to our client, beginning with a function to get a list of mailboxes:  app.get " mailboxes",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker serverInfo ;       const mailboxes: IMAP.IMailbox[] = await imapWorker.listMailboxes  ;       inResponse.json mailboxes ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  Remember that REST tells us that retrieving a resource should usually use the GET  method, so app.get   is used to register this path. The resource we’re getting is a list of  mailboxes, so  mailboxes is a logical choice for the path.  All the app.XXX   calls  where XXX is an HTTP method  require a callback function to   execute when a matching request is received, and they all receive the incoming request  and the response object used to produce the response to the caller. Here, because we’re  going to make some asynchronous calls using the await keyword, we have to throw an  async keyword before the function.  Now, what the function does is simple: it instantiates an IMAP.Worker object –  something we’ll be looking at later – and then calls its listMailboxes   method,  capturing the array of IMAP.IMailbox objects it returns. Even without seeing that code,  hopefully, it’s pretty obvious what’s going on at a conceptual level. It then passes that  array to the json   method of the passed-in response object, which marshals that array   181   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  into JSON and returns it to the caller. Should any exceptions be thrown along the way,  we’ll instead send a plain text "error" response back using the inResponse.send    method. The client will need to react appropriately to that, but that’s a story for the next  chapter!  This basic pattern you will see repeated in all the remaining endpoint handler   methods, with minimal variation. In a sense, our Express app is just acting as a proxy  to the IMAP  and also SMTP and Contacts  object, which are responsible for the real  functionality. That’s a pretty common pattern to implement since it nicely segregates  duties. It also means that we can test our IMAP, SMTP, and contact-handling code  individually without Express having to be in the mix. Nothing says that you have to  organize your code this way, but it’s a logical way to do so and has a lot of benefits.   REST Endpoint: List Messages  Now that we have a handler for getting a list of mailboxes, let’s create one for getting a list  of messages in a specific mailbox:  app.get " mailboxes :mailbox",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker serverInfo ;       const messages: IMAP.IMessage[] = await imapWorker.listMessages {         mailbox : inRequest.params.mailbox       } ;       inResponse.json messages ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  Yep, as I said, that’s the same basic pattern, with just a few logical different: we  call IMAP.Worker.listMessages   this time, and of course, we get an array of  IMAP. IMessage objects this time. Finally, we need to be able to specify the name of the  mailbox to get messages for, and as you can see, we have :mailbox on the end of the  path  anything beginning with a semicolon in the path is taken to be such a replacement   182   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  token . This is a cue to Express that there will be some dynamic value after  mailboxes   in the path, and we want that value presented to our code as a request parameter, which  we can access with inRequest.params.mailbox.   REST Endpoint: Get a Message  Next, we need a function to get the body contents of a specific message in a specific  mailbox because the function to get the list of messages will only get metadata about  each message, not the actual message itself:  app.get " messages :mailbox :id",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker serverInfo ;       const messageBody: string = await imapWorker.getMessageBody {         mailbox : inRequest.params.mailbox,         id : parseInt inRequest.params.id, 10        } ;       inResponse.send messageBody ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  Once again, the same basic pattern, which just a few minor differences. This time,  we need two tokens in the path: the name of the mailbox and the ID of the message to  retrieve. After that, we call a different method  getMessageBody    this time, and now  we get a simple string back, which is the content of the message. Also, note that because  request parameters are always string, but the getMessageBody   function requires an  integer for the ID, that’s why parseInt   is needed. Finally, the retrieved message body  is returned as plain text via a call to inResponse.send    the client will be responsible for  dealing with the case where this might be an HTML-based message .  183   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   REST Endpoint: Delete a Message  Next, the client will need the ability to delete a message:  app.delete " messages :mailbox :id",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker serverInfo ;       await imapWorker.deleteMessage {         mailbox : inRequest.params.mailbox,         id : parseInt inRequest.params.id, 10        } ;       inResponse.send "ok" ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  This looks almost identical to the endpoint for getting a message in that it requires   the same path to allow the client to identify a message uniquely. Beyond that, it’s a  simple call to imapWorker.deleteMessage  , passing it the mailbox and integer-ized  message ID, so to speak, and we’re good to go. Also, take note that now we’re using the  HTTP DELETE method, to be good REST citizens, so the app.delete   method is used  to register this endpoint.   REST Endpoint: Send a Message  Now, it’s time to implement the endpoint for sending a message:  app.post " messages",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const smtpWorker: SMTP.Worker = new SMTP.Worker serverInfo ;       await smtpWorker.sendMessage inRequest.body ;       inResponse.send "ok" ;  184   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server      } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  Once again, very simple: the HTTP POST method is used to send a message, so app.  post   is used to register the handler function. In that function, the incoming request  body will contain all the information we need to send a message, including target email  address, subject, and message text, and the express.json middleware will have nicely  parsed that into an object for us to pass along to smtpWorker.sendMessage  . Since the  IMAP protocol is responsible for retrieving mailboxes and messages while the SMTP  protocol is used to send them, it makes sense to have a separate module for each. But, as  you’ll see later, each of them presents a Worker class that contains the methods we call.  We return a simple "ok" string here, nothing more is needed.   REST Endpoint: List Contacts  With all mailbox and message functionality built, we now need to turn our attention to  the endpoints needed to deal with contacts. There are three of them, beginning with a  function to list contacts:  app.get " contacts",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const contactsWorker: Contacts.Worker = new Contacts.Worker  ;       const contacts: IContact[] = await contactsWorker.listContacts  ;       inResponse.json contacts ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  185   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Well, this is getting a little repetitive, isn’t it?! Yes, indeed, it’s the same pattern that   you are by now very familiar with, just dealing with contacts now, and the Contacts  module and its Worker class. And now, we’re dealing with IContact objects  what that is,  it’s coming up, I promise! , but other than that, there’s nothing new here.   REST Endpoint: Add Contact  Similarly, adding a contact is just like sending a message in that it’s another HTTP POST  function handler:  app.post " contacts",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const contactsWorker: Contacts.Worker = new Contacts.Worker  ;        const contact: IContact = await contactsWorker.addContact    inRequest.body ;        inResponse.json contact ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  The contactsWorker.addContact   method will do all the real work, given the   object produced by the express.json middleware from the request body content, and  here we’re actually returning the added contact that is returned by contactsWorker. addContact  . This is necessary because, as you’ll see later, this object will contain a  unique identifier added during the save process, and the client will need to display that  new contact in the list and will need to know that ID in case the user decides to delete  the contact. We could certainly not do this and have the client call the GET contacts  endpoint again to get the entire contacts list, which would now include the added  contact, but that’s kind of wasteful of resources. Returning the added object allows the  client to do what it needs to without that additional request, and this is also a pervasive  pattern to follow with REST services.  186   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   REST Endpoint: Delete Contact  We have just one endpoint left to implement, and that’s the one for deleting a contact.   As you can probably guess, it looks extremely similar to the endpoint for deleting a  message:  app.delete " contacts :id",   async  inRequest: Request, inResponse: Response  => {     try {       const contactsWorker: Contacts.Worker = new Contacts.Worker  ;       await contactsWorker.deleteContact inRequest.params.id ;       inResponse.send "ok" ;     } catch  inError  {       inResponse.send "error" ;     }   }  ;  The path is different, of course, and this time it includes the ID of the contact to  delete, and naturally we’re using the Contacts module and its Worker class and its  deleteContact   method, but beyond that it’s just more of the same. A little boring  perhaps, but there’s something to be said for logical self-consistency too!  Now that the RESTful API is defined and Express is ready to handle those requests,  let’s get into the details of those Worker classes to see the actual work done. But, before  we can do that, we have one other source file we need to look at for the rest to make  sense.   Gotta Know What We’re Talking to: ServerInfo.ts The Worker classes for IMAP and SMTP, it should be apparent, will need to know  about the server s  they are talking to. Without an IMAP server and an SMTP server  somewhere, the code won’t be able to receive or send an email. That’s where the  ServerInfo.ts file comes into play:  const path = require "path" ; const fs = require "fs" ;  187   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  First, we begin by importing the Node path module again, as well as the fs module,  which is the File System module. Note that when importing Node modules, you don’t  typically type the variables that reference them.  We need these modules in order to read the stored information about the servers.   This information will be stored in a file named serverInfo.json in the  server  directory. The contents of that file will be  {   "smtp" : {     "host" : "mail.mydomain.com", "port" : 999,     "auth" : { "user" : "user@domain.com", "pass" : "xxx" } },   "imap" : {     "host" : "mail.mydomain.com", "port" : 999,     "auth" : { "user" : "user@domain.com", "pass" : "xxx" } } }  You’ll need to create this file and supply the applicable information before MailBag   will work. I’m gonna go out on a limb here and assume that file is self-explanatory.  Now, we’ll define an interface that mimics that file:  export interface IServerInfo {   smtp : {     host: string, port: number,     auth: { user: string, pass: string }   },   imap : {     host: string, port: number,     auth: { user: string, pass: string }   } }  And we’ll declare a variable typed to that interface:  export let serverInfo: IServerInfo;  188   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Now, the goal is to read the serverInfo.json file in and create an object that   adheres to the IServerInfo interface and that the serverInfo variable points to. That’s a  trivial exercise with Node:  const rawInfo: string =   fs.readFileSync path.join __dirname, ".. serverInfo.json"  ; serverInfo = JSON.parse rawInfo ;  The file is read in as a plain string with the fs.readFileSync   function, again using   path.join   to get a fully qualified path to the file. Finally, we parse the string into an  object and assign it to serverInfo. That’s it! After that, we have an object in memory  that contains the information needed to connect to the server! Yes, that means that  MailBag is a single-user webmail application, and it means you can’t change the server  information through the UI itself  well, you’ll have to trust me about that until the next  chapter I suppose, but it’s true , which we can consider a feature, not a bug! However,  you may want to keep an eye out for the “Suggested Exercises” section later. Hint! Hint!   Time to Send the Mail: smtp.ts Alright, with the basic API built in Express, let’s start to look at the code behind one of  the two Worker classes, the SMTP.Worker, for sending emails. This class, which is found in  the SMTP.ts source file, makes use of a Node module to do the grunt work, and that’s the  first thing we need to look at in order to make sense of the application code:  import Mail from "nodemailer lib mailer"; import * as nodemailer from "nodemailer"; import { SendMailOptions, SentMessageInfo } from "nodemailer"; const nodemailer = require "nodemailer" ;  Of course, we begin with some imports, as most modules do. The first three are   related to the nodemailer module, which we’re going to take a quick detour and look  at next, so let’s skip those for now. In addition to those, we have the IServerInfo from  the ServerInfo.ts file that we looked at earlier to contain the information needed to  connect to the SMTP server.  189   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  After that, we begin to define the Worker class:  export class Worker {   private static serverInfo: IServerInfo;   constructor inServerInfo: IServerInfo  {     Worker.serverInfo = inServerInfo;   }  When instantiated, the server information must be sent in, and it is then stored in   the static serverInfo member. Making this member static is superfluous frankly because  this class is instantiated with each usage, so there’s no real point in it being static. I just  did it this way as a reminder that in TypeScript, classes can have static members  and  there’s no harm to it being static in this case .  The sendMessage   method of this class is where the real action is, but before we can   look at that, we have a quick detour  or two, as it happens  to take.   A Quick Detour: Nodemailer The nodemailer module  https:  nodemailer.com about  is a Node module for Node  applications to allow “easy as cake” email sending  not my words, that’s what the author  says about it – though I do agree with the sentiment! . This module is nice because it’s just  a single module and has no dependencies, which is frankly kind of rare in the Node world. Using it is simple: you create a “transport”, which is an object that knows how to talk a  particular protocol to send mail with, most usual SMTP, providing the transport whatever  information is needed to connect, and then you call the sendMail   method on the  transport, passing it the details of the message to send. That, really, is all there is to it! In  fact, it’s so simple that I’m not going to show a bit of sample code here and will instead  just show you the real code used in MailBag and have that effectively be the example!   Another Quick Detour: Generics But first, before we go into the code, I have to touch on a TypeScript topic that until now  hasn’t been necessary: generics.  Generics, in simplest terms, is a way to write code that can work on multiple types.  It’s not a concept specific to TypeScript, but it comes up often in TypeScript. The classic  example to demonstrate generics is this:  function echoMe inArg: string : string { return inArg; } 190   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  It’s a simple function that does nothing but returns the argument passed in. Since   the argument and the return type are the same, this is a very limited function: it will  only work for the string type. What if we wanted to do the same for the number type, for  example? Well, there are two choices. One is this:  function echoMe inArg: any : any { return inArg; }  Typing the argument and return as any  or specifying to type and allowing   TypeScript to infer any  will work, but it gives up a lot of the core benefits of TypeScript  in terms of type safety and IDE auto-completion and all that good stuff. Another option  is to change echoMe   to echoString   and then add a second function:  function echoNumber inArg: number : number { return inArg; }  That, of course, will work too, but now we can’t just call echoMe   for a string or   number, which would be the ideal answer, wouldn’t it?  Well, that’s where generics come in! With generics, you can do this:  function echoMe  inArg: T : T { return inArg; }  The trick is to add   after the function name. This is referred to as a type variable   sometimes called type parameters or generic parameters, but they all mean the same  thing, and I personally prefer type variable . The letter T is simply a placeholder – you  could use any valid identifier there. But T is most typical, so I’m going with it! With this  in place, we can specify T anywhere else, like in the argument list as the type of inArg,  and as the return. TypeScript will now allow any type to be passed in but can still provide  warning and errors about type issues where appropriate  and possible . You can then  call this as you normally would:  alert echoMe "hello"  ;  However, you get more benefit if you now write it like this:  alert echoMe  "hello"  ;  That way, TypeScript will enforce the argument being a string. When it’s just a static   string like that, you don’t gain anything, but imagine something like this:     a is some array passed into your function for  let i = 0; i < a.length; i++  {   echoMe  a[i] ; }  191   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Now, TypeScript will complain if it the array isn’t typed as string, but you can still   use echoMe   for numbers or any other type the same way.  Note that you do not have to use the same type for the return. For example:  function echoMe  inArg: T : string {   return "-" + inArg + "-"; } alert echoMe  42  ;  Here, the type of inArg will be number, but we’re returning a string. Generics aren’t just for function arguments and return types, though. We can apply   them to interfaces too:  interface Args { arg1: K, arg2: L } function logTypes  inArg1: T, inArg2: U : Args  {   console.log typeof inArg1 , typeof inArg2  ;   let args: Args  = {     arg1: inArg1, arg2: inArg2   };   return args; } console.log logTypes  "frank", 42  ;  The Args interface is defined, and generics are used for the two properties it   contains. Yes, you read that right: generics, plural! You can, in fact, declare as many  type variables as you wish and use them however you wish. Here, I want each of the two  arguments to have different types potentially, so I declare two type variables. And, to  prove that T is nothing special, I used K and L as identifiers. No problem! I could even  have written  interface Args  {   arg1: arg1Type, arg2: arg2Type }  But that would strike me as a bit superfluous, but it does make the point: you really   can use any valid identifier you want; it doesn’t need to be a single letter even.  Next, the logTypes   function is declared, and it too has two type variables. I also   specify that the return type must adhere to the Args interface contract, and generics   192   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  are again used here to ensure any types will be allowed. Inside the function, it’s just  outputting the types of the two incoming variables to the console and then returning  an object of type Args with the passed in arguments assigned to its properties. When  executing, in the console you will see a line that says “string number,” proving that the  types were correctly applied when logTypes   is called and throughout logTypes    and in Args as appropriate. Remember that appending   when calling  logTypes   is optional because TypeScript will infer the types if you don’t, but I’d  suggest it’s good form to do so anyway.  While that’s not all you can do with generics in TypeScript, those are the basics, and  everything else is just variations on a theme, so I think this is good enough for the basics.  Remember that it doesn’t always make sense to use generics, but sometimes it very  much does, and sometimes you may find that you have to. We’ll see one such case soon.   Back to the Code! Okay, now we can have a look at the sendMessage   method, which is the only other  thing in the Worker class.   Worker.sendMessage     The sendMessage   method takes in an object that must adhere to the SendMailOtions  interface, defined by nodemailer. The inOptions object can contain fields like the from  address, the to address, carbon copy addresses  cc , blind carbon copy addresses  bcc ,  the subject of the message, and the text of the message  text . MailBag, being a simple  client, will only support from, to, subject, and text:  public sendMessage inOptions: SendMailOptions : Promise  {   return new Promise  inResolve, inReject  => {     const transport: Mail = nodemailer.createTransport Worker.serverInfo.smtp ;     transport.sendMail inOptions,        inError: Error  null, inInfo: SentMessageInfo  => {         if  inError  {           inReject inError ;         } else {  193   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server            inResolve  ;         }       }      ;   } ; }  An issue arises here in that nodemailer doesn’t natively provide an async await-   compatible API. It instead uses the callback approach. But, if you go back to the code of  main.ts, you’ll see that async await is used everywhere when calling the Worker classes.  How can that be?  Any time you have a callback-based API, you can wrap a call to it in a Promise. You  then return the Promise from the function that makes the call, and that caller can then  use async await to call it. Then, in the function, you simply have the callback passed to  the underlying function reject or resolve as appropriate.  So, here, all the calls to nodemailer are wrapped up in the created Promise object.   Inside it, the nodemailer.createTransport   method is first called, passing it the  server information. That gets us a connection to the SMTP server. Then, the transport. sendmail   method is called, passing it inOptions, which contains the message details  passed in from the client. A callback function is the second argument to transport. sendMail  , and that callback is passed an Error object and information about the sent  message. Note that the error object can be null, which to TypeScript is a different type.   To avoid a compilation error, we have to use what’s called a union type, which is what  Error  null is. This tells TypeScript that the inError can be one of two types: either  Error or null  we also could have inError as any; that would accomplish the goal too,  but is less TypeScript-y, so to speak! . Finally, inside the callback, if there is an error  object, then something went wrong, and the Promise must reject. Otherwise, it was  successful and is resolved.  One final subtle issue comes up here, and it’s where that detour into generics earlier   comes in! Notice the return type here is Promise . The Promise part makes  sense: any function that is to be called with async await must return a Promise. But why  do we have a generic   there? Well, TypeScript is smart enough to look at what is  ultimately being returned, whether as a result of a resolve or reject, from the function. If  the caller specifies a type for the variable that gets the eventual outcome of the Promise,  as is good form in TypeScript and as such is done in main.ts, then that type must  match, or TypeScript will complain. So, with Promise , we’re essentially saying to   194   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  TypeScript: “this function returns a Promise, but it promises to return a string eventually,  so make sure the variable that the returned value goes into is that type.” The generic  variable declaration is how we express that promised final type to TypeScript.   Time to Get the Mail  and Other Stuff : imap.ts Having seen how to send messages, now it’s time to see how to receive them – as well  as listing mailboxes and messages in them! This functionality is housed in the IMAP.ts  source file.  Before we look at the actual code, though, we have another one of those detours I   appear to be so fond of, this time to discuss two Node modules, this time for dealing with  the IMAP protocol and for parsing the body of receive emails.   A Quick Detour: emailjs-imap-client and mailparser The emailjs-imap-client module  https:  github.com emailjs emailjs-imap-client   is the one responsible for interacting with the IMAP server on behalf of MailBag. It  describes itself as a “low-level IMAP client for all your IMAP needs.” Short, but sweet!  Using it is rather simple. First, you create a client:  const client = new ImapClient host[,port][,options] ;  The port and options are optional, only the host is required. Once that’s done, you   initiate a connection:  client.connect  .then    => {  * Do what you want *  } ;  In a nutshell, that’s all there is to using it. Of course, getting real work done requires   more code. For example, to get a list of mailboxes and log them to the console:  client.listMailboxes  .then  mailboxes  => {   console.log mailboxes ; } ;  For many operations, you need to select a mailbox first. That’s easy to do:  client.selectMailbox   .then mailbox  {      Do your work } ;  195   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  You get the idea, I’m sure. Pretty much everything you can do with emailjs-imap-   client is done in this same way. However, you can also use an async await approach, as  you’ll see in the MailBag code itself.  In addition to this module, we’ll also be using the mailparser module  https:    nodemailer.com extras mailparser . The reason is that when we retrieve a message,  its structure is relatively complex, and it can be tricky to consume. For example, what if  the body contains embedded images? How do you deal with them? How do you get all  the header information into an easy-to-use form, things like from, to, and bcc addresses?  If you wrote the code to handle such a message yourself, you would quickly find its  complexity ballooning. Better to let a suitable module do the job, and that’s precisely  what mailparser does.  In simplest form, you can use the simpleParser that mailparser provides:  const simpleParser = require "mailparser" .simpleParser; simpleParser source[,options],  err, parsed  => {} ;  The source argument is the only one required, and it will, of course, be the   message that, in our case, emailjs-imap-client, retrieves for us. What you’ll get back is a  ParsedMail object. This object contains several properties, including subject, from, to,  date, and text  the body of the message in plain text .  As with emailjs-imap-client, the API is set up for async await calls, and that’s how   the MailBag code will use mailparser as well.   Back to the Code! Okay, now to actual code! As always, we begin with some imports:  const ImapClient = require "emailjs-imap-client" ; import { ParsedMail } from "mailparser"; import { simpleParser } from "mailparser"; import { IServerInfo } from ". ServerInfo";  Those should be self-explanatory at this point. We know we need the two modules  discussed in the last section, and they won’t work without server information, so let’s  move on to the first interface defined:  196   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  export interface ICallOptions {   mailbox: string,   id?: number }  There are four functions that we need to build here: one to list mailboxes, one to list  messages within a mailbox, one to retrieve a message, and one to delete a message. Of  those, the last three require the caller to specify the name of the mailbox and the ID of  the message. Well, to be more precise, all of them require the mailbox name, but only  retrieving and deleting a message requires the ID. Therefore, the id property is defined  as optional so that we can use it in all cases.  Next, we need an interface for a message itself:  export interface IMessage {   id: string, date: string,   from: string,   subject: string, body?: string }  This will be used when listing messages in a mailbox as well as when retrieving  an individual message. The difference is that when listing messages, the body of the  message will not be returned. We’ll have a separate function for the client to call for that.  We’ll do this to save bandwidth: no sense returning the entire body if we don’t know if  we need it, which is the case when listing messages. Until the user clicks a message, the  body, which is the bulk of a message obviously  in most cases at least , isn’t needed.  That’s why body is optional.  Next, we need an interface for a mailbox:  export interface IMailbox { name: string, path: string }  That’s pretty simple! The name is obviously what will be shown on the screen, and  the path is how code will identify a mailbox for operations like listing mailboxes and  retrieving a message. The name and path need not match; hence, we need to separate  fields for them.  Next, we have a single line of code that will execute when the module loads:  process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0";  197   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  This is  most likely  necessary to make the calls to the IMAP server work. The issue  is that, by default, Node will attempt to validate the certificate presented by the server  when connecting over TLS  Transport Layer Security – if by chance you’re unfamiliar  with TLS, here’s a great reference: https:  tls.ulfheim.net . This setting tells Node to  skip that step. To be clear, this makes a TLS connection insecure, since you can’t be sure  you’re talking to the legitimate server, which is the point of validating the certificate. But  there can be a fair bit of work that goes into getting that validation to work, so this setting  allows us to skip that. To be clear, if you intend to use MailBag in production, then you  will want to change this! But, as a learning exercise, one that will be connecting to an  IMAP server you provide and so know to be good, it’s sufficient, I think. Also note that  if you aren’t connecting to the server over TLS in the first place, then naturally this is all  irrelevant.  Now we come to the Worker class. Just like the SMTP.ts file, and just like the   contacts.ts file you’ll see later, the Worker class here is what the code in main.ts  interacts with:  export class Worker {   private static serverInfo: IServerInfo;   constructor inServerInfo: IServerInfo  {     Worker.serverInfo = inServerInfo;   }  As with SMTP.Worker, the serverInfo field is defined static, not because it must be,   but just as a reminder that it can be in TypeScript. And, also like SMTP.Worker, the server  information is passed in to the constructor and stored.  Now, the first real method we come to is connectToServer  . This is to avoid   redundancy: all the other methods will make use of this when connecting to the IMAP  server. It is responsible for creating the emailjs-imap-client object and connecting it to  the server:  private async connectToServer  : Promise  {   const client: any = new ImapClient.default      Worker.serverInfo.imap.host,     Worker.serverInfo.imap.port,     { auth : Worker.serverInfo.imap.auth }    ;  198   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server    client.logLevel = client.LOG_LEVEL_NONE;   client.onerror =  inError: Error  => {     console.log        "IMAP.Worker.listMailboxes  : Connection error",       inError      ;   };   await client.connect  ;   return client; }  The client is created, passing in the host and port from serverInfo. We also need to  pass in a username and password. That’s done in the third argument, which you’ll recall  from earlier is an optional options argument. One of the attributes it can contain is auth,  which must be an object containing a user  username  field and pass  password  field. I then set the logLevel property on the client to the LOG_LEVEL_NONE constant  also  from the client . I did this to keep the output when running quiet because without that,  you get a fair bit of logging about what’s going on. It’s helpful if you need it, but most of  the time it’s just a lot of noise that we don’t need.  After that, an error handler is set up on the client. This will be used when the client.  connect   method is called if a connection to the server can’t be established. In this  case, I didn’t get fancy: the error is logged, but that’s it. No re-trying or anything like that.  We’ll just let the server blow up in such a case because there really isn’t much we could  do anyway. Finally, the connection is established, and the client returned to the caller.   Worker.listMailboxes     The first of the four primary methods is up next, and it’s the one for listing mailboxes:  public async listMailboxes  : Promise  {   const client: any = await this.connectToServer  ;   const mailboxes: any = await client.listMailboxes  ;   await client.close  ;   const finalMailboxes: IMailbox[] = [];   const iterateChildren: Function =      inArray: any[] : void => {     inArray.forEach  inValue: any  => {  199   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server        finalMailboxes.push {         name : inValue.name, path : inValue.path       } ;       iterateChildren inValue.children ;     } ;   };   iterateChildren mailboxes.children ;   return finalMailboxes; }  First, we get a client using that connectToServer   method from before. Then, it’s  a simple call to client.listMailboxes   to get the list. We then call client.close    since the connection isn’t needed any longer  and note that there are conditions under  which the client actually cannot be reused, so to avoid problems and to keep things  simple, I just assumed that it was always true; hence, the connection is closed and a new  client constructed with each method call .  Now, there’s one complication here: the list of mailboxes you get is hierarchical. For   example, what you get might be this:  { "root": true,   "children": [     {       "name": "INBOX", "delimiter": " ", "path": "INBOX",       "children": [],       "flags": ["\\HasNoChildren"],       "listed": true, "subscribed": true     },     {       "name": "[Gmail]", "delimiter": " ", "path": "[Gmail]",       "flags": ["\\Noselect","\\HasChildren"],       "listed": true, "subscribed": true,       "children": [         {           "name": "All Mail", "delimiter": " ",           "path": "[Gmail] All Mail",           "children": [],  200   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server            "flags": ["\\HasNoChildren","\\All"],           "listed": true, "specialUse": "\\All",           "specialUseFlag": "\\All", "subscribed": true         }       ]     }   ] }  That’s a problem because on the client, I want to present a flat list of mailboxes. In   addition to that problem, the client will only care about name and path, none of the other  attributes supplied here. So, we have some work to do!  The iterateChildren   function is called recursively to deal with the hierarchy.  For each mailbox encountered, regardless of level in the hierarchy, it will be added to  finalMailboxes. But what’s added is a new object that contains just the name and path.  The children property is then passed to iterateChildren   to continue through the  hierarchy.  In the end, finalMailboxes will be a one-dimensional array of objects, each   containing name, and path, exactly like the client will want. Perfect!   Worker.listMessages     For listing messages in a named mailbox, the listMessages   method is provided:  public async listMessages inCallOptions: ICallOptions : Promise  {   const client: any = await this.connectToServer  ;   const mailbox: any = await client.selectMailbox inCallOptions.mailbox ;   if  mailbox.exists === 0  {     await client.close  ;     return [ ];   }   const messages: any[] = await client.listMessages      inCallOptions.mailbox, "1:*", [ "uid", "envelope" ]    ;  201   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server    await client.close  ;   const finalMessages: IMessage[] = [];   messages.forEach  inValue: any  => {     finalMessages.push {       id : inValue.uid, date: inValue.envelope.date,       from: inValue.envelope.from[0].address,       subject: inValue.envelope.subject     } ;   } ;   return finalMessages; }  In this case, after instantiating and configuring the client, we need to select a mailbox  to operate against. The inCallOptions object will contain the name of the mailbox in its  mailbox field, so we pass that to client.selectMailbox  , and we get back a mailbox  object. Note that there doesn’t appear to be a type for this though; hence, any is used   this is also true for the client . Next, we need to find out how many messages there are.  It’s a little weird to me, but the value of the exists property of the mailbox object tells us  this. If there are no messages, then an empty array is returned.  If there are messages, however, we need to retrieve them. To do so requires a call to   the client.listMessages   method. This method takes in the name of the mailbox,  what messages to retrieve, and what properties we want. The second argument is a query  that determines what messages we’ll get. Here, I’ve specified that we want messages  beginning with the first one and all messages after it  asterisk, as is typical, means all, or  any value . If you wanted to implement a paging mechanism, you could maybe get the  first ten with "1:10", but then the code becomes a lot more complicated pretty quickly   the next ten would be "11:20", and so on, and you’d need to pass that information from  the client and keep track of it, and so on . For each message, I want just the unique ID of  the message and the metadata about it, called the envelope. Critically, we do not want the  body at this point.  For each message returned, an object is constructed, pulling the information the   client will need out of the object returned by client.listMessages  : the unique  message id, the date it was sent, where it’s from  just the email address, which is in the  address property of the object returned , and the subject. The finalMessages array  containing those objects is ultimately returned, and our work here is done!  202   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   Worker.getMessageBody     Since listMessages   doesn’t return message bodies, we need a function to get that,  and that’s where getMessageBody   comes in:  public async getMessageBody inCallOptions: ICallOptions : Promise  {   const client: any = await this.connectToServer  ;   const messages: any[] = await client.listMessages      inCallOptions.mailbox, inCallOptions.id,     [ "body[]" ], { byUid : true }    ;   const parsed: ParsedMail = await simpleParser messages[0]["body[]"] ;   await client.close  ;   return parsed.text; }  There’s no special function in emailjs-imap-client to get bodies, you simply use the   listMessages   method, but this time specifying that we want the body. More precisely,  because the body can be in multiple parts, it’s actually an array that we request. Note  here that we are specifying a specific message ID in the call, and to do that we have  to pass the fourth argument, { byUid : true }, to tell the method that we’re listing  messages based on a specific ID. Unlike listMessages  , where we were dealing with  a range of messages based on their ordinal number, here it’s a unique ID for a specific  message; hence, that option is required.  Once we have the message, we can then pass it along to the simpleParser    constructor, which parses the message into a ParsedMail object. After closing the  connection, we just return the text property of that object, which is the plain text body  content, all necessary concatenation of multiple body parts dealt with for us. Note that  the client already has any metadata needed for this message; hence, it’s only the body  content we care about here.  203   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   Worker.deleteMessage     Finally, we come to the final method this Worker class must provide, the one for deleting  a message:  public async deleteMessage inCallOptions: ICallOptions : Promise  {   const client: any = await this.connectToServer  ;   await client.deleteMessages      inCallOptions.mailbox, inCallOptions.id, { byUid : true }    ;   await client.close  ; }  This method is similar to getMessageBody   in terms of the call to the client; this  time, it’s the deleteMessages   method. We again pass it the mailbox name and the  unique ID of the message to delete, and we again must tell it that we are, in fact, passing  it a unique ID. But, unlike getMessageBody  , we’re basically done at that point, save for  closing the connection, of course.   Reach Out and Touch Someone: contacts.ts Now that you’ve seen how to send and receive mail, let’s go in a different direction and  look at what goes into the contacts functionality. This will take us until some side topics,  and that requires two quick detours!   A Quick Detour: NoSQL For this app, we need to store data, namely, our contacts. There are, of course, many  ways to do this. You could write them out to plain text files. You could store them in  cookies in the browser or perhaps the LocalStorage mechanism in the browser. You  could store them in a good ole’ database on a server. In fact, that last one is what we’re  going to do: a database that lives on the server. That way, our contacts are there when we  need them regardless of where we access MailBag from.  Most people think of an RDBMS  Relational DataBase Management System  like   Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL when you say the word database. In such a   204   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  database, you have tables, each with rows of data records and each table having columns  of data attributes. If you want to get the list of customers in a table, as an example, the  magic of the Structured Query Language  SQL  allows us to write a query like so:  select * from test.customers  table for each.  the bread and butter of databases.  This will get you a list of all users in the table and all the data attributes defined in the   Now, that’s straightforward and highly useful and, I bet, nothing new to you. This is   The problem, as some see it at least, is that each row in that table has a rigid   structure. Each row, which logically represents a customer, has, perhaps, a unique ID, a  first name, a last name, a credit card number  don’t get any ideas; they’re bogus! , and  a number of purchases. That’s all there is, and every customer you stuff into that table  must adhere to that structure. If you need to add attributes later, say, a middle name, you  can add a column to the table, but now all of the existing items will have blank or null  values in that field  assuming you allow empty or null values  unless you do some extra  work. That could be a problem if the code that uses this database doesn’t account for it.  While adding a column is usually a benign enough change, sometimes what’s required is  a more complex change than that, and you can easily break things, especially where the  relationship between rows is concerned  and remember it’s a relational database; after  all, relationships matter! .  SQL and the RDBMSs it works with are very powerful constructs, and they are   appropriate for all sorts of use cases.  Underlying the power of an RDBMS is the concept of ACID, an acronym for   Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. ACID describes the ability of the  RDBMS to ensure that the data is always in a consistent state at the end of every  operation. This is accomplished by many hard rules that you must follow, which results  in nothing that might violate ACID being allowed.  While ACID is likely what you want in a banking application, for example, there   are some situations where it isn’t, arguably, optimal. Sometimes, you don’t care about  relationships  much , and you don’t want to have a rigid structure to your data, and data  integrity might not be the highest consideration even. That’s where the NoSQL concept comes into play.  205   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  In contrast to ACID, the BASE model underpins NoSQL: Basic Availability, Soft state,   and Eventual consistency. This term leads you into a lot of computer science theory,  such as the CAP theorem and horizontal vs. vertical scaling, but for developers, it boils  down to the idea that the persistent data store loosens the rules!  For a start, you no longer must define a rigid database schema up-front. There are   no tables at all to define, so you don’t have to specify what attributes a customer has, for  example, by creating columns in a table for each. That usually means getting started with  NoSQL is faster than with an RDBMS.  Instead of tables and rows, you have collections of documents, each document   identified by a key value. What goes in those documents can be virtually anything, and  the structure of the document doesn’t need to be rigidly defined. In fact, you can have  documents with very different structures in a collection at a single time.  You could literally store an image, such as a GIF file, as a document in a collection,  or even an executable file if you wanted to. It’s simply mapped to a unique key, and that  key, among other mechanisms, can be used to retrieve it. You can also store a chunk of  textual data in common formats like XML, JSON, or CSV.  The bottom line, though, is that whatever you happen to be storing, it’s always   mapped to a unique key value. That is, pardon the pun again, the key idea! Because of  this, there are no SQL queries to write. You look documents up by specific key values or  iterate over a collection of documents looking for those that match some criteria you  define.  At first, it may seem like there’s no way to query a NoSQL database, but that’s not  the case. It is still, in fact, possible to query a NoSQL database if what you’re storing is  structured in some way. If you’re storing JSON documents, for example, you might have  a customer document like so:  { FirstName : "Jack", LastName : "Miller", CreditCardNumber : 123456789,  NumberOfPurchases : 6 }  Some key value will identify that, but it’s also possible to find only the document with   a LastName of Miller without knowing any of the keys. You don’t give up those sorts of  capabilities by going to NoSQL; it’s just that you no longer have to write SQL queries.  Now, instead, and depending on which NoSQL implementation you use, you might write  code more like this to find a customer with FirstName “Jack”:  var c = Customers.find { FirstName : "Jack" } ;  206   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Without getting into the specifics of the code  because for this discussion it doesn’t   really matter , Customers is a collection of documents, and find   looks for any that  have attributes matching the specified criteria. You’ll get back an array of, in this case,  JavaScript objects.  At this point in time, JSON is clearly the most used data storage format when working   with NoSQL, and for a good reason, NoSQL plays very well with JavaScript, so JSON is a  natural choice. JSON is what we’re going to be storing for MailBag.  Now that you have the basic idea behind NoSQL down, let’s look at the library that   allows us to implement it in MailBag: NeDB.   Another Quick Detour: NeDB NeDB  https:  github.com louischatriot nedb  by Louis Chatriot is a Node library  that presents to our code a simple NoSQL database API. There are TypeScript bindings  available for it, so we can use all the TypeScript goodness we want with it too.  You’ve undoubtedly heard of the popular NoSQL database MongoDB. It is almost   certainly the most well-known NoSQL database. I thought about using it for this  project, but I decided against it because MongoDB is a separate server that you run and  make calls to from your code. I went with NeDB because it is just a library, so it’s fully  embedded in the server side of MailBag, no additional server to set up and connect to. But here’s the good news: NeDB seeks to mimic a useful subset of MongoDB’s API,  meaning that most of what you’re about to learn will translate easily to MongoDB if you  ever want or need to use it.  Under the covers, NeDB stores its data in plain text files that you can open in a text   editor if you want, which is helpful in case you ever need to recover anything. It has   most  of the critical features of MongoDB, certainly everything you’ll need: creating  documents, updating them, finding them and deleting them, and allowing you to do so  across different collections of documents.  To give you a quick flavor of working with NeDB, here’s a simple example:  const db = new nedb {   filename : "people.db", autoload : true } ;  207   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  db.insert { firstName : "Billy", lastName : "Joel" },   function  inError, inDocument  {     if  inError  {       console.log `Error: ${inError}` ;     } else {       db.findOne { firstName : "Billy" },         function  inError, inDocument  {           if  inError  {             console.log `Error: ${inError}` ;           } else {             console.log inDocument ;           }         }        ;     }   }  ;  You create an instance of a database by providing NeDB with the filename of   that database and also telling NeDB to load it at that point automatically  or you can  manually open it later if you want to . Then, you can call the insert   method, passing  it an object to insert, and a callback function. The callback function can do whatever  makes sense. In this case, I just retrieve the document that was just inserted using  a query and log it to the console  NeDB will add an _id property to the object, so if  I wanted to I could have done db.findOne { _id : inDocument._id}  instead, to  retrieve it by its unique key . Remember that NeDB is almost always asynchronous, so  you’ll need to deal with callbacks  or build a Promise-based wrapper around it if you  prefer . The findOne   method does exactly that: finds a specific single document based  on some query, here based on the firstName attribute. Of course, if there’s a chance  there is more than one document with a firstName of Billy, then chances are you want  to use the find   method instead, which returns an array of matching documents.  For this server, you won’t need too much more NeDB than this, but know that it   provides a very rich API, so if you need a simple database module that doesn’t have any  outside dependencies  as in no additional server to run  and want to use the NoSQL  approach, then NeDB is, in my opinion, one of the best choices available in the world of  Node development.  208   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   Back to the Code! Okay, let’s kick things off, as we always do, with some imports:  import * as path from "path"; const Datastore = require "nedb" ;  from the previous section, to get a path to the data file. Now, let’s define an interface to describe a contact:  export interface IContact {   _id?: number, name: string, email: string }  That’s not much, is it? We need NeDB, naturally, and we need path, as you know   We’re going to use this for all use cases, meaning when we add or delete a contact,  as well as when listing contacts. In the case of adding a contact, the _id field won’t be  populated initially, meaning the client won’t supply it. Instead, NeDB will be populating  that for us, so we have to mark it as optional here; otherwise, our add operation wouldn’t  meet the contract as a result of not having an _id field.  With that ready to go, we can start to define the Worker class:  export class Worker {   private db: Nedb;   constructor   {     this.db = new Datastore {       filename : path.join __dirname, "contacts.db" ,       autoload : true     } ;   }  Upon construction, a NeDB Datastore object is created, and a path to the contacts. db file is given. We tell NeDB to load it automatically, and NeDB will create the file for us  if it doesn’t already exist. This is all we need to prepare for the remainder of the methods  this class must provide.  209   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   Worker.listContacts     First up is providing a list of contacts, which is what the aptly named listContacts    method does:  public listContacts  : Promise  {   return new Promise  inResolve, inReject  => {     this.db.find { },        inError: Error, inDocs: IContact[]  => {         if  inError  {           inReject inError ;         } else {           inResolve inDocs ;         }       }      ;   } ; }  As with nodemailer, NeDB doesn’t provide an async await-based API, so we have to  do the same sort of trick with wrapping it in Promises as we did with nodemailer in order  to be able to write our code with async await. Inside the Promise, it’s a simple matter  of calling the find   method on the DataStore referenced by this.db and passing no  search criteria as the first argument  well, technically an empty search criteria object,  to be pedantic . That returns us all the records in the contacts.db file, which is our  contacts collection, in NoSQL parlance. Since we know that the objects that will be  returned will match the IContact interface’s structure, we can type the inDocs argument  as such, even though technically NeDB doesn’t know about our type. It doesn’t have to,  though: this is all TypeScript territory. Then, just like with nodemailer, we either reject  the Promise, passing the error to the caller, or else we return the array of documents,  which are our contact objects. Notice the use of generics for the return type: here, we’re  promising to resolve with an array of IContact objects, which TypeScript is happy to see!  That’s all there is to it!  210   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server   Worker.addContat     Next up is addContact  , called to add a new contact to the collection:  public addContact inContact: IContact : Promise  {   return new Promise  inResolve, inReject  => {     this.db.insert inContact,        inError: Error, inNewDoc: IContact  => {         if  inError  {           inReject inError ;         } else {           inResolve inNewDoc ;         }       }      ;   } ; }  It’s even simpler than listMessages  , but follows the same basic structure. The   insert   method this time is what we need, passing the contact to add as the first  argument. This method passes the added object to the callback, which will now include  an _id field, so we return that object to the caller, and eventually the client, so that it can  add it to the screen as appropriate  all of which you’ll see in the next chapter .   Worker.deleteContact     Finally, we need to implement a deleteContact   method for removing a contact:  public deleteContact inID: string : Promise  {   return new Promise  inResolve, inReject  => {     this.db.remove { _id : inID }, { },        inError: Error, inNumRemoved: number  => {         if  inError  {           inReject inError ;         } else {           inResolve  ;         }       }  211   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server       ;   } ; }  Here, the remove   method is used, and for the first time, we need to provide a   query. This method receives just the ID of the contact to delete, and we need a match on  the _id field, hence the query object seen here. This method takes a second argument,  an options argument, that provides some additional flexibility  at the time of this writing,  the only option was whether to remove multiple documents if more than one matches  the selection criteria – when using the _id field though, that would never be the case,  so an empty options object is sufficient here . In this case, the callback is passed the  number of documents removed. Given the way the code is structured and how the  client will be written, there’s really no situation where anything but a value of 1 would be  passed, so I saw no real purpose in returning anything at all when resolving the Promise.  As long as it’s not rejected, we treat it as a successful removal.  And, with this final method, we’ve now explored all the code of the MailBag server!   Testing It All Let’s talk a bit about testing. We’ve built the server side of MailBag, but how do you go  about testing it? Obviously, you could write some code, maybe in main.ts, to call the  various Worker methods to see if everything works, but that doesn’t test the whole thing:  how do we know the client-facing API is working right?  To do this sort of holistic testing, without having the client written yet, is a good idea   because then we know the server is working correctly and any problems we face while  writing the client are likely client-specific issues.  Perhaps the simplest way to do such testing is with the well-known command-line  program curl  https:  curl.haxx.se  . If you’re on a ∗nix system, then you likely have  it already. If you’re on Windows, like me, then you’ll need to download it separately.  Fortunately, there’s no installation: just explode the archive, and you’re ready to use curl. As a first example, how do we test the function to get mailboxes with curl? That’s very   curl localhost mailboxes  easy:  212   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  That presumes the server is running on the same machine, of course, but that’s a  reasonable expectation at development time. By default, curl will make a GET request  to the URL you specify. Assuming the server is running, you should see a response,  displayed directly in the console, something like what you see in Figure 8-4  obviously,  what you actually see will depend on the server you connect to and what mailboxes the  account has .  Figure 8-4.  A simple API test with curl  We can similarly get a list of messages in a mailbox with  curl localhost mailboxes INBOX  Figure 8-5 is the type of response you can expect to see.  Figure 8-5.  A listing of messages in my inbox  Then, we can get the body of the message easily:  curl localhost messages INBOX 103319  Figure 8-6 is something like you would see if you had this message on your server   and in your inbox.  213   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Figure 8-6.  The boring contents of a boring email!  To delete that message, we must use the DELETE method of course, and curl   supports that as well:  curl -X DELETE localhost messages INBOX 103319  Figure 8-7 shows the result, followed by listing the inbox messages again to show that   it’s now empty of that message.  Figure 8-7.  Message gone, inbox empty!  What about sending messages, you ask? That’s easy, too, but it requires a little more   curl work:  curl -d '{ "to" : "fzammetti@gmail.com", "from" : "fzammetti@etherient. com", "subject" : "This is a test", "message" : "If you see this then it  worked!" }' -H "Content-Type:application json" -X POST localhost messages  Since sending a message requires sending data in the body, we must define that   data, and that’s where the -d  for “data”  switch comes into play. We can supply  the JSON directly after it. Optionally, you can store the JSON in a file and specify -d   . We also must tell curl to let the server know that we’re sending  JSON, and that’s what -H is for. This allows us to set arbitrary request headers, Content-  Type:application json in this case.  214   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  Caution  on Windows, you’ll need to replace the single quotes surrounding the  Json with double quotes and then escape each of the quotes inside. otherwise,  this won’t work.  I’m going to skip the functions for contacts here since it’s just more of the same, and   I’m pretty sure you get the idea by this point.   Optional Tooling Now, curl is good for sure, and you can do much more with it than what’s shown here,  but there are arguably better tools for doing this sort of testing  well, at least, better in  some ways . One of the most popular is called Postman  www.getpostman.com . You  could think of it as curl but with a pretty face! Figure 8-8 shows an example of testing one  of our endpoints with Postman.  Figure 8-8.  An example of using Postman for RESTful web service endpoint  function testing  Here, I’ve exercised the function to list mailboxes.  215   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server  There are some interesting things to note here. First, looking on the left, you can see  that with Postman, you can organize your requests into collections. I’ve got a collection  for MailBag tests, and I’ve got another collection for some Amazon AWS tests that I was  working on at the time for another project. Over on the right, you can see that each open  request gets a tab along the top, so you can quickly and easily jump between, say, listing  mailboxes and listing the messages within a mailbox. You can select the method there,  GET, in this case, and, of course, specify the URL. You can append whatever you need  to append to the URL, a mailbox name, for example, to get messages for it. Then, below  the URL, you can see various tabs are available for settings headers, cookies, request  parameters  if needed , or basic auth information if applicable. You can also directly  enter your body content there, so the JSON for sending a message, for example. Then,  on the right, you can see the response from the last request. Postman is kind enough  to parse the JSON for us and present it in a nicely readable form. That’s much easier to  examine than what curl gives us!  Postman isn’t just for REST testing: any type of HTTP request can be tested here.   And Postman isn’t the only such tool around! Another popular one is Insomnia   https:  insomnia.rest , and there are certainly others. But, in my experience,  Postman and Insomnia do tend to be the most commonly used.  In the end, it doesn’t matter whether you choose one of these, a different tool, or just  go with basic curl itself. What matters is testing your service endpoints so that when you  get ready to build the client for them, you know the server is reliable.   Suggested Exercises It’s always good, I think, to take existing code and try and extend and change it a bit.  It’s an excellent way to get some practice without having to think through everything  yourself. With that in mind, here are a few ideas of things you might attempt on your own  to sharpen your skills:     Add an updateContact   function using the PUT method to be able   to change an existing contact. You’ll need to accept the potentially  new name and email address, plus the existing _id, and then write  the NeDB code to update it.  216   Chapter 8    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the server     Set HTTP response codes according to the discussion in the section   on REST rather than using 200 for everything. This will give you some  experience working with Express and some practice using Postman,  Insomnia, or curl to test your changes.     Write some curl commands to test the contact functions. Then, do   the same with Postman to make sure you got these concepts.   Summary In this chapter, you learned quite a lot! You learned about writing a RESTful API with  Node and Express. You learned about finding TypeScript bindings for the Node modules  you might want to use, and you learned about several modules, including emailjs-  imap- client and nodemail. You got a look at the NoSQL concept and the NeDB module  for storing data using it. In the process, you got a look at some new TypeScript goodness  in generics and generally got to see a lot of TypeScript in action.  Now that we have a server built and an API ready, we can begin to build the client   portion with React, which is what the next chapter is all about!  217   CHAPTER 9  Delivering the Goods:  MailBag, the Client  With the server side of MailBag ready to go, it’s time now to move on to the client side  of things! Here, we’ll get back to playing with our good friend React, along with some  supporting libraries, and we’ll hook it all up to the server that was built in the previous  chapter. In the end, we’ll have ourselves a fully functional webmail application that you  could use for real if you wanted to!   What Are We Building? Unlike the server part of MailBag, the client part is something we can easily take a look  at because it is, by its nature, a visual thing. That makes describing what we’re going to  build easy for an author like me! So let’s begin with Figure 9-1, which shows MailBag as  it would appear after initial launch  well, in a general sense, what you would actually see  would depend on the mail account you hook it up to, but this is linked to my account, so  it gives you a general idea at least .    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_9  219   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Figure 9-1.  Our first look at MailBag’s client  I make no representation that this app can compete with the likes of Gmail or  Outlook, but it gets the primary job of a webmail application done. Up top, you see  that you can create a new message, and you can create a new contact. A list of existing  contacts is over on the right, and on the left is the list of mailboxes that the IMAP server  used returns. In the center, at the top, is a list of messages in the currently selected  mailbox. For example, if I click the INBOX button on the left, I see some messages in  Figure 9-2.  220   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Figure 9-2.  A few messages in my inbox  I get A LOT of spam – this was a good day!   In this screenshot, I’ve also gone ahead and clicked one of the messages, which   shows its details at the bottom. As you can see, I can reply to the message, or I can delete  it  and none of the fields above the buttons are editable . When you click the NEW  MESSAGE button in the toolbar, you see the same basic screen except that the ID and the  date are hidden, the From field becomes a To field, and there is just a single Send button   and everything is editable, naturally .  When you click a contact on the right or when you click the NEW CONTACT button,   you wind up at essentially the same place, which is shown in Figure 9-3.  221   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Figure 9-3.  Adding a contact  Similar to the view of a message, clicking an existing contact shows a screen that is   essentially the same except that in that case, the SAVE button becomes a DELETE button   and the fields are read-only .  Note  although this section is just meant as a walkthrough, you of course can   and maybe even should  fire up MailBag now and talk a look at it in action.  assuming you’ve already gone through Chapter 8 and downloaded the source code  bundle and installed dependencies, you can fire up the MailBag server, and the  client is then available at http:  localhost automatically.  222   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   Basic Requirements Now that you know what the app looks like, let’s catalog the basic functionality it must  provide. As I said, we’re not challenging Google’s webmail supremacy, so the list isn’t all  that extensive  and, given what you saw in the last chapter, you effectively already know  what the list must contain :     The server must be consulted for a list of mailboxes under a single   configured IMAP account once at startup.     The user can select a mailbox from the list, which will double as a   refresh action. The messages will be displayed in a tabular form and  will show the date received, subject, and sender.     Clicking a message shows it below the list, including subject, sender,  ID on the server, date received, and, of course, the message itself, as  plain text.     The user must be able to delete the message being viewed.     The user can begin a new message in reply to the message being   viewed. The subject will automatically have “Re:” prepended to it,  and the original message will be shown below a bit of marker text.     A list of contacts will be stored on the server. The user can select a   contact from a list and can delete the contact or begin a message to  them. They can also, of course, add a new contact.     Like mailboxes, the server will be consulted once at startup for the list   of contacts.  In addition to the requirements, since this is an interface, we need to discuss the   overall structure of it, if for no other reason than to provide a common vocabulary to use  going forward. The screenshots make it fairly obvious, but the overall structure, or layout,  of the interface is described in Figure 9-4.  223   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Figure 9-4.  The overall layout of the client in block form  As you can see, in block form, it mimics the arrangement shown in the screenshots.   However, how we achieve that layout is the critical piece of the puzzle, and that’s  something we’re going to talk about a bit later on, after a necessary detour. But, before  we get to that, we have to set up the project, so let’s do that now!   Setting Up the Project Setting up the client project is very similar to setting up the client. Create a client  directory under the project root directory alongside the server directory. Then, create a  src directory in it.  Typically, I would detail the initialization steps to take at this point, but I think you’ve   seen those steps enough between the server code and previous examples, so let’s save  some time, and instead, I’ll just show you what the package.json file should be after  doing a basic npm init and then installing all the necessary dependencies:  {   "name": "mailbag",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "MailBag",  224   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client    "main": "main.tsx",   "scripts": { "build": "webpack --mode production" },   "author": "Frank W. Zammetti",   "license": "ISC",   "devDependencies": {     "awesome-typescript-loader": "^5.2.1",     "babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import": "^6.18.0",     "css-loader": "^3.3.0",     "html-loader": "^0.5.5",     "html-webpack-plugin": "^3.2.0",     "style-loader": "^1.0.1",     "ts-loader": "^6.2.1",     "typescript": "^3.7.3",     "webpack": "^4.41.2",     "webpack-cli": "^3.3.10",     "webpack-dev-server": "^3.9.0"   },   "dependencies": {     "@material-ui core": "^4.6.0",     "@material-ui icons": "^4.5.1",     "axios": "^0.19.0",     "normalize.css": "^8.0.1",     "react": "^16.11.0",     "react-dom": "^16.11.0",     "@types material-ui": "^0.21.7",     "@types react": "^16.9.16"   } }  If you download the source archive for this book, that’s what you’ll find, and you can  just do an npm install at this point to get everything installed. Otherwise, just overwrite  this file with this content  and this is true of the remaining configuration files we’re about  to discuss .  225   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  As you can see, TypeScript is installed, and then too is Webpack. Also, several   Webpack loaders and plugins are installed  and some of those results in some additional  dependencies being automatically added by NPM .  i also added a script that can be used to execute a build, so now npm run   Note  build is all we need to do to kick off the build. also note that axios didn’t have  type bindings at the time of this writing and normalize.css isn’t a library of code,  it’s a stylesheet, so typing doesn’t factor into it.  We’ll get back to Webpack in just a moment, but this effectively takes care of the  development dependencies. But what about runtime dependencies? Well, I’ve also  installed those as well, and they are as follows:     React – Of course!     normalize.css – A CSS reset to ensure we start with a consistent   client-side environment across browsers as far as styles go     Axios – A library for server communications  more on this later      Material-UI – A library providing UI widgets to build our UI with   based on Google’s Material guidelines  more on this later too   Now, when TypeScript was installed, we got a default tsconfig.json file, and that  needs to be modified a bit also. Again, I’ll just show you what the final file should look  like  remember that you will have other content commented out since the tsc -init will  produce it, but this is the content that should be enabled with the appropriate values :  {   "compilerOptions" : {     "esModuleInterop" : true,     "sourceMap" : true,     "noImplicitAny" : false,     "module" : "commonjs",     "target" : "es6",     "lib" : [ "es2015", "es2017", "dom" ],     "removeComments" : true,     "jsx" : "react",  226   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client      "allowJs" : true,     "baseUrl" : ". ",     "paths" : { "components *" : [ "src components *" ] }   } }  So far, these are the same basic steps that were done when building the server. But,   unlike the server, there are some additional installation and configuration steps we must  do because the client will be using Webpack. It will have been installed at this point, but  we must initialize this project with Webpack too:  npx webpack init  That creates a default webpack.config.js file. As an aside, you also should go ahead  and delete the .yo-rc.json file that’s created since it won’t be needed  you can keep the  README.md file if you want though . For our purposes here, the answers you give during  this step won’t matter because we’re just going to overwrite the file with the following:  const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require "html-webpack-plugin" ;  module.exports = {   entry : ". src code main.tsx",   resolve : { extensions : [ ".ts", ".tsx", ".js" ] },   module : {     rules : [       { test :  \.html$ , use : { loader : "html-loader" } },       { test :  \.css$ ,         use : [ "style-loader", "css-loader"] },       { test :  \.tsx?$ , loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' }     ]   },   plugins : [     new HtmlWebPackPlugin { template : ". src index.html",       filename : ". index.html" }    ],   performance : { hints : false },   watch : true, devtool : "source-map" };  227   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  You can see the rules defined for handling HTML, CSS, and TSX files, using the   loaders installed before.  The HtmlWebPackPlugin has a particular purpose. We tell Webpack what HTML  file in our source code to start with via the entry attribute, and it then modifies it as  needed  including adding a proper module loader  so that our app can be launched after  Webpack has transformed it. This plug is responsible for that.  The performance attribute is necessary because, by default, Webpack will produce a  warning or error, depending on various factors, if the final bundle is over 250Kb. Setting  performance : { hints : false } disables this behavior.  Setting watch:true serves much the same purpose as the scripts entries in the server   did: Webpack will watch our source files and automatically rebuild the client if any files  change. That gives us that nice, fast turnaround for changes we so liked when working  with the server code, but we get it “for free” with Webpack just by adding this attribute!  Finally, devtool set to "source-map" ensures that a source map is created for the   final bundle, allowing us to do some debugging when necessary.   Source File Rundown Of course, you know we’re dealing with files in the client directory and, more  precisely, in the src directory. Like the server code, the client code is laid out the same  fundamental way. Critically, the final “executable” client code winds up in the dist  directory  which would have been created when the Webpack initialization step was  done, but you can, of course, add it manually if you skipped that step . But let’s talk  about the files that make up this application in the src directory  and the subdirectories  in it :                      src index.html – The main entry point of the application.  src css main.css – A regular old CSS file with some shared styles.  src code main.ts – The main code entry point. This is where React  will begin to build our UI from.  src code Contacts.ts – Like the server, this is the file that contains  a Worker class for dealing with contacts  this is what talks to the  server side of MailBag for contacts .  src code IMAP.ts – Like Contacts.ts, this contains a Worker for  performing all the IMAP functions, in conjunction with the server.  228   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client                                              src code SMTP.ts – Just like IMAP.ts, but for the SMTP  send   functionality.  src code config.ts – A simple configuration file that will contain  information about the server component and your email address.  src code state.ts – This is where most of the action of the app  actually is, but we’ll get to that in due time!  src code components BaseLayout.tsx – A React component that  houses all others.  src code components Toolbar.tsx – A React component that is the  toolbar.  src code components MaliboxList.tsx – A React component that  is the list of mailboxes on the left.  src code components ContactList.tsx – A React component that  is the list of contacts on the right.  src code components MessageList.tsx – A React component that  is a list of messages in a selected mailbox.  src code components WelcomeView.tsx – A React component that  serves as just a simple splash screen when the app starts up or when  certain operations occur.  src code components ContactView.tsx – A React component that  is the presentation of the contact view when a contact is selected or a  new one is being created.  src code components MessageView.tsx – A React component  that is the presentation of a message or when a message is being  composed.  As always, we’ll be examining each of these in turn, but I think that gives you a good   rundown of what code we’ll be looking at. It seems like a lot of files, but really, most of  them are very small.  229   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   The Starting Point: index.html This is where it all begins: the entry point to the application:                     MailBag              Well, that’s kind of anticlimactic, isn’t it? Remember earlier when I said that   Webpack will transform this file as appropriate to make the app work. Because of that,  there’s not much for us to do here, so it’s a nice, simple HTML document with no real  content. It’s a little weird that we don’t even import any JavaScript because obviously,  that must happen at some point, or else MailBag isn’t going to do much! But that’s what  Webpack takes care of for us, so we don’t even have to think about that much.   The Starting Point, Redux: main.tsx Okay, now it’s time to get to some real code! The first file to look at is main.tsx, which is  the main entry point code-wise. This is where React will start to execute our application  from. Given the .tsx extension, we know that this is a JSX file that is written in  TypeScript. And it begins simply enough:  Note  For the remainder of this chapter, to save some trees, i’ve removed all  imports except where they are something unique, as is the case here.  import "normalize.css"; import ".. css main.css";  It may seem a bit odd to see CSS files imported into a code file like this, but it’s okay  because JSX and the TypeScript compiler  and Webpack  know how to deal with that on  our behalf. That’s also why index.html doesn’t have them imported, as you’d normally do.  230   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Now, as far as what those files are, normalize.css is a CSS reset, meaning that it   normalizes initial style conditions on a page across browsers. It takes care of ensuring  every browser has the same padding around a given HTML element, for example, or that  the margins on the document itself are consistent across browsers. All of that stuff can be  different from browser to browser, so using a reset helps ensure that the styles our app  uses, which are in the main.css file, are applied on a stable, consistent foundation. You  don’t use any styles in normalize.css yourself directly; they’re strictly something that  gets applied automatically before your app’s styles do  which is why normalize.css must  be imported first, by the way .  With the imports out of the way, it’s time for some code:  const baseComponent = ReactDOM.render     , document.body  ;  That kicks off the React portion of the proceedings, rendering the BaseLayout   component, which we’ll be looking at soon, into the body of the document. With that, we  have an app on the screen!  Before we get there, though, there’s a fair number of other stops this train must make,   starting with application state.   A Quick Detour: State’ing the Obvious Every React application – well, any nontrivial application anyway – is going to need some  sort of state, as was discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Exactly how you maintain this state is  a topic of much debate in the React community. I mentioned Redux in Chapter 3. Redux  is a way to have a centralized state object that all the components in the application  share. It’s a popular approach, but it’s just one of many. And you don’t need to look  outside of React itself if you don’t want to because React offers the notion of state by  default, and that’s what I did with MailBag. The trick, though, is that to have components  sharing that state, you have to push it up the component tree as far as needed.  In other words, recall that React always constructs a component tree. Any tree has a  single element at the top with children beneath it, and those children can have children,  and so on. So, where you place your state object becomes a question, and you answer  it by determining which components in the tree need access to it. You simply find the  highest component in the tree that is a parent to all that need it, and that’s where you put  your state.  231   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  In MailBag, you’re going to find that we have a single component, BaseLayout, that is   a parent to all the rest. This is the most logical place to place state then.  However, what is state in MailBag, exactly? Well, state in React is nothing but a   JavaScript object. You could define it directly within the BaseLayout.tsx code file, but  I wanted to have it be separate, just to organize the code a little cleaner. That’s what the  state.ts file is all about. It defines an object that BaseLayout will include, and it’s where  all state for the application will live, along with the methods needed to mutate state.  But it’s not quite as simple as defining an object. We have to play some games in order to   make this work, which is why this file’s code begins in not quite the way you might expect:  export function createState inParentComponent  {  Rather than just exporting a literal object, we have a function. This function takes in a  reference to the component that contains it, BaseLayout, in our case, for reasons that will  become apparent shortly. Then, this function simply returns an object, our state object:    return {     pleaseWaitVisible : false,  Our state consists of a series of properties in the object, starting with   pleaseWaitVisible. This is a flag that will tell our code whether a “please wait” popup,  which we’ll show every time we call the server, is visible or not. More on this later!  We also need to maintain a list of contacts that the user has created, and that’s where   the contacts array property comes in:      contacts : [ ],  Similarly, a list of mailboxes is needed:      mailboxes : [ ],      messages : [ ],  And, assuming a mailbox has been selected, we need the list of messages within it:  When the user clicks a mailbox or clicks the NEW MESSAGE or NEW CONTACT   button or clicks a contact in the list, what they see in the middle of the screen changes.  This we refer to as the “view,” and what view is current must be known for React to  render the correct content:      currentView : "welcome",  232   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  It starts out with the "welcome" view and then changes to one of "welcome",   "message"  when viewing a message , "compose"  when creating a message , "contact"   when viewing a contact , and "contactAdd"  when adding a contact . How this changes  the view is something you’ll see later.  Earlier, I mentioned the array of messages in the currently selected mailbox, but how   do we know what the current mailbox is? As it happens, we have a property for that:  Then, we must think about what state is necessary when either viewing or creating a   message. For that, we have a series of properties:      currentMailbox : null,      messageID : null,     messageDate : null,     messageFrom : null,     messageTo : null,     messageSubject : null,     messageBody : null,      contactID : null,     contactName : null,     contactEmail : null,  I’d imagine those are all obvious. Note that messageID would only ever be populated   when viewing an existing message, and it’s the ID of the message on the server.  Similar, when viewing or creating a contact, we’ll need some state too:  The state object also contains a collection of methods that the remainder of the   application code calls on to mutate state in various ways. These are termed “state  mutator methods,” and I’m going to introduce each of those methods as they are first  encountered.  So, to wrap this up in a bow, what will happen is that this createState   function   will be called at some point inside BaseLayout, and the state object will be returned.  That object will then be a member of BaseLayout, and we’re good to go.  Well, mostly… but we’ll get to a small problem next!  233    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Chapter 9   Back to the Code! Now that you have an idea of what state is in play, we can get back to the code in main.tsx:  baseComponent.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;  Once the UI is built, the next task that must be accomplished is to call the server  and get a list of mailboxes available for the account and a list of contacts the user has  created. Any time we call the server, we’re going to display a “please wait” popup, so the  user knows something is happening. This will also serve the purpose of blocking the UI  for a moment so that the user can’t go and do something that causes problems while the  server works. The showHidePleaseWait   method of the state object, the first of the state  mutator methods we’ve encountered, does this for us:  showHidePleaseWait : function inVisible: boolean : void {   this.setState { pleaseWaitVisible : inVisible } ; }.bind inParentComponent   You must remember that with React, you don’t directly tell components to do   things. Instead, you mutate state in some way, using the setState   method on the  component that holds the state, which causes React to repaint the pertinent parts of the  UI as needed. In this case, to show the please wait popup, all we need to do is update  the pleaseWaitVisible state attribute, setting it to true. React will then redraw the UI,  and what will happen, something you’ll see later, is that the popup element will now  be set to visible. This will make sense when we look at the MainLayout.tsx file, but just  keep in mind for now that pleaseWaitVisible is set to true when we want the please  wait popup to be shown and false when we want it hidden and that React will see that  change in state and redraw the screen as needed. That’s the key thing right now.  The little problem I alluded to earlier is that since we are limited to calling the   setState   method on the component that contains the state object, any code that tries  to call it must execute within the context of that component. When we define a separate  object for state as I did in order to break it out into its own source file, the this reference  in the methods inside state won’t be what we need. In other words, any method inside  the state object won’t have access to setState   because its execution context, at least in  some instances, won’t be the BaseLayout component.  That’s where the bind   statements come in, and you’ll see these on every function  in the state object. When the state object is constructed via the call to createState  , a  reference to the BaseLayout instance was passed in. That’s what we bind all the mutator   234   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  functions to. That way, they will always have access to setState   as we need. Note that  if any of them needs to touch the state object itself, which they obviously would need to  in at least some cases, they can do so by accessing this.state, since components always  expose their state via that property.  With the please wait popup showing, we can now call the server:  async function getMailboxes   {   const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker  ;   const mailboxes: IMAP.IMailbox[] = await imapWorker.listMailboxes  ;   mailboxes.forEach  inMailbox  => {     baseComponent.state.addMailboxToList inMailbox ;   } ; }  We know that getting a list of mailboxes is an IMAP operation from our look at  the server code, and since the IMAP Worker class on the client seeks to mimic that  API that is exposed by the server to the IMAP Worker class there, it makes sense that  we’d be calling IMAP.Worker.listMailboxes   here too. And the code looks almost  identical to the endpoint handler function code on the server as a result. We’ll look at  the client-side IMAP close a bit later, but I think you’ll find it rather trivial. The bottom  line, though, is that we get back an array of mailboxes, and we then iterate them and  call the addMailboxToList   method on the state object  which we can do because we  have a reference to the BaseLayout component via the baseComponent variable . That  will update the mailboxes array in state, causing React to render the screen to show the  mailboxes on the left.  And addMailboxToList   method is the next state mutator we’ve hit:  addMailboxToList : function inMailbox: IMAP.IMailbox : void {   const cl: IMAP.IMailbox[] = this.state.mailboxes.slice 0 ;   cl.push inMailbox ;   this.setState { mailboxes : cl } ; }.bind inParentComponent   First, you have always to remember that when you call setState  , you should never   pass references to objects in state. That may sound weird, but it’s easy to understand  when dealing with arrays, as we are here. Your first inclination would be to directly push   235   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  inMailbox into state.mailboxes and then try to call this.setState {this.state. mailboxes} . Everyone tries that at first because it seems reasonable! However, it won’t  work because what you pass into setState   replaces what’s in state at the time, and  trying to do that with what’s already there… well, let’s just say React won’t like you very  much!  Instead, we make a copy of the array via slice 0 , then push the new mailbox into  that copy, and finally pass that copy to setState  . Now, everything works as expected.  Note that you only have to do this sort of copying updating setting when dealing with  objects and collections.  If you’re paying attention so far, you will have noticed that we haven’t actually called   the server to get the list of mailboxes yet, we’ve only defined a function to do so. That’s  because the function that calls imapWorker.listMailboxes   must be marked async  since we’re await’ing the response. getMailboxes   is marked async, so now we need to  call it:  getMailboxes  .then function   {   async function getContacts   {     const contactsWorker: Contacts.Worker = new Contacts.Worker  ;     const contacts: Contacts.IContact[] = await contactsWorker.listContacts  ;     contacts.forEach  inContact  => {       baseComponent.state.addContactToList inContact ;     } ;   }   getContacts  .then    =>     baseComponent.state.showHidePleaseWait false  ; } ;  We don’t want to get the list of contacts until the list of mailboxes is done so that  we know that all server calls are done before the please wait popup is hidden, so we  use the then   syntax to chain them. Inside the then   callback, another function  is defined, getContacts   this time, for the same reason: async await usage. Once  defined, we can call getContacts   and again use the then   syntax so that we can call  showHidePleaseWait  , passing false this time, to cause React to hide the please wait  popup.  236   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  The addContactToList   state mutator method is used in there, and it’s virtually   identical to addMailboxToList  :  addContactToList : function inContact: Contacts.IContact : void {   const cl = this.state.contacts.slice 0 ;   cl.push { _id : inContact._id,     name : inContact.name, email : inContact.email } ;   this.setState { contacts : cl } ; }.bind inParentComponent   In this case, I’ve constructed the object push  ’ed into the contacts array explicitly,   not for any particular reason other than to show that you can. If you wanted the client  contact objects to have different fields than the server-supplied objects for some reason,  this is how you can do that translation.   A Bit of Configuration: config.ts For the client app to talk to the server, it, of course, has to know its address. The config.ts  file meets that need:  export const config: {   serverAddress: string, userEmail: string } = { serverAddress : "http:  localhost", userEmail : user@human.com };  It’s quite simple: it’s just a literal object with a serverAddress property that gives the   address of the MailBag server. During development, this is likely to be localhost. Also,  note that it must contain the protocol prefix. This object also contains the userEmail that  provides your eMail address. I’m gonna guess that’s not your email address, so go ahead  and update it as appropriate! This file will be imported into the Worker classes as needed.  Hey, speaking of Worker classes, that’s exactly what’s up next!   A Worker for All Seasons Just like the server side of MailBag, we have three “Worker” classes on the client  side: Contacts.ts, IMAP.ts, and SMTP.ts. These are the interface between the client  application itself and the MailBag server, and they break down functionally in the same  way as their server counterparts. Before we look at the React code itself that defines out   237   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  UI and makes it functional, let’s take a look at these Worker classes so that when you see  them being used, you’ll know what they’re doing.  But how, exactly, does the code in these workers talk to the server? For that, we must   take a quick detour!   A Quick Detour: AJAX AJAX is a technique that came to life, so to speak, at the hands of one Jesse James Garrett  in an essay he wrote in February 2005. There, he coined the term AJAX, which stands  for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. The interesting thing about AJAX, though, is  that it doesn’t have to be asynchronous  but virtually always is , doesn’t have to involve  JavaScript  but virtually always does , and doesn’t need to use XML at all  but probably  doesn’t 99+% of the time .  AJAX is, at its core, an exceedingly simple and, by no stretch of the imagination,  original concept: it is not necessary to refresh the entire contents of a web page for  each user interaction, or each “event,” if you will. When the user clicks a button, it is no  longer necessary to ask the server to render an entirely new page, as is the case with the  “classic” Web. Instead, you can define regions on the page to be updated and have much  more fine-grained control over user event handling as a result. No longer are you limited  to simply submitting a form to a server for processing or navigating to an entirely new  page when a link is clicked.  The interesting thing about AJAX is that it is in no way, shape, or form new, and it  actually wasn’t even when Mr. Garrett coined the term. A decade ago, when AJAX was  still somewhat new, I liked to say that you could always tell who has done AJAX before  and who hadn’t because those who had are mad that it was a big deal and they didn’t get  credit for “inventing” it themselves!  Nowadays, the term AJAX isn’t used as much as before. People tend to talk about  “out-of-band requests” or simply “asynchronous requests” or, indeed, simply “server  requests” because it’s pretty much the de facto way of communicating with a server on  the Web when you aren’t refreshing the entire page.  At its core, AJAX works because of something invented originally by Microsoft: the   XMLHttpRequest object. This is a JavaScript object that allows you to write code like this:  let req;  238   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  let which;  function retrieveURL url  {   if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {     req = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     req.onreadystatechange = processStateChange;     try {       req.open "GET", url, true ;     } catch  e  {       alert e ;     }     req.send null ;   } else if  window.ActiveXObject  {     req = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;     if  req  {       req.onreadystatechange = processStateChange;       req.open "GET", url, true ;       req.send  ;     }   } }  function processStateChange   {   if  req.readyState == 4  {     if  req.status == 200  {       document.getElementById "urlContent" .innerHTML = req.responseText;     } else {       alert "Problem: " + req.statusText ;     }   } }  Even if this is your first time seeing such code, I bet you can understand it without   much trouble. In short, you create an XMLHttpRequest object  branching based on   239   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  whether the object exists or not, because for a while, not all browsers exposed the  object in the same way . You then hook a callback function up to it that will be called  whenever the state of the object changes  e.g., when it connects to the server or when  the response comes back – the object has an entire lifecycle you can hook into . You  give it the URL to connect to, optionally tell it about any data you’re sending  in this  case, there is none , and finally, send the request. The callback function will be called,  multiple times, in fact, based on the lifecycle events provided. We only care about the  readyState 4, which is what occurs when a response comes back. Then, assuming we  got an HTTP 200 back, we take the responseText, which is what the server sent, and  insert it into a DOM node, presumably a  , or do whatever else we want with it.  That’s it, that’s all there is to it.  Nowadays, you wouldn’t even write that most likely, and instead, you’d use the   newer Fetch API. Although not quite ubiquitous across all browsers, it’s not supported by  the majority, so now you can write code like this:  const response = await fetch url ;  Yep, that’s much better, isn’t it? However, aside from the browser having to support this API, it also must support   async await, as you can see. If you want to reach the widest audience possible, but you  don’t want to write all the XMLHttpRequest code as in the preceding text, you’ll probably  want to use a capable library that abstracts all of this away from you  and, most likely,  provides many other benefits . For MailBag, that’s exactly what we’re going to do!   Getting Some Help: Axios  Rather than doing “naked” AJAX, we’ll instead use a popular library for it instead: Axios   https:  github.com axios axios . In simplest terms, Axios is a Promise-based HTTP  client that works in both browsers and Node. It uses XMLHttpRequest under the covers  in a browser and uses the Node http library when used in a Node-based app. Being  Promise-based means that you can use async await with it  or the more “classical”  Promise approach , which makes for a very nice API.  Axios offers some more advanced capabilities, including the ability to hook into the  request and response cycle to make modifications broadly  think cross-cutting concerns  in Aspect-Oriented Programming, or AOP, for things like logging and security . Or, it  offers the ability to transform request and response data in various ways automatically  and the ability to cancel requests, if necessary.  240   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Using Axios also means security because it includes protection against client-side  XSRF, or Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is a trick nefarious sorts can use to transmit  requests to the server, masquerading as you, a legitimate user. That’s bad news,  obviously, and Axios can keep your application safe from it without doing anything  special on your part.  Axios has broad browser support and is as easy to use as  const response = await axios.get "your_server_url" ;  Or if you don’t want to use async await  what’s wrong with you?! :  axois.get "your_server_url" .then function response  {      Do something with the response. } ;  Do you need to POST some data to the server? No problem:  axios.post "your_server_url",   { firstName : "Burt", lastName : "Reynolds" }  ;  Axios will automatically serialize that object into JSON for transmission to the server    naturally, you can pass an object reference there, it doesn’t need to be an object literal  like that . It will also automatically deserialize a JSON response so that you have a nice  JavaScript object to play with.  You can use any other HTTP method there too: DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT,   PATCH, whatever you need, it’s all there for you.  You can optionally pass a configuration object to any of the request methods after   the URL  or even in place of the URL if the object itself contains the URL , which allows  you to modify the requests in many ways. The options available are numerous, so I won’t  go through them all, but a few of particular interest are the following:      transformRequest – You provide a function here, and this will allow  you to modify the response before it’s passed to the response handler  function  or returned to the variable specified in an await call .  You can do the same for the request with the transformResponse  property.     params – You can provide a list of URL parameters to append to the   URL with this.  241   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client      timeout – By default, Axios waits forever for a response  well, at least  until the browser itself times out . With this option, you can specify  how long to wait.     proxy – Does your network require you to go through a proxy? If so,   you can specify that information with this property.     onDownloadProgress – This is a function to be called periodically  while a response is downloading, allowing you the ability to show a  progress bar or spinner or similar UI element  you can do this with  onUploadProgress in the opposite direction too .  Axios is a very robust but extremely simple-to-use library that, for me, is the obvious   choice for our server communication needs in MailBag.   Mirroring the Server Part 1: Contacts.ts The first Worker class we’re going to talk about is in the Contacts.ts file, which, of  course, means we’re dealing with the Contacts Worker class. But, even before the Worker  class, we find that we have an interface present:  export interface IContact {   _id?: number, name: string, email: string }  If you look back at the Contacts.ts file on the server side, you’ll find this same   interface. That should make sense to you: after all, we’re passing objects back and forth  that need to have the same structure on both sides of the conversation!  After that, the Worker class begins:  export class Worker {  Nothing special there, and again identical to the server. Within the Worker, we find a   series of methods, beginning with listContacts  .  242   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   Listing Contacts  When we want a list of contacts to display on the screen, we need to ask the server for  that. We know that, via the Express-based RESTful interface, we ultimately need the  Worker.listContacts   method in the Contacts.ts file on the server to be executed, so  we mimic that interface design with listContacts   in the client-side Worker class:  public async listContacts  : Promise  {   const response: AxiosResponse =     await axios.get `${config.serverAddress} contacts` ;   return response.data; }  Here, you can see Axios used, as we discussed in the previous section. The   serverAddress from the config object is used to construct the appropriate path, and  this is of course a get request, so that’s the Axios method executed. Then, the response  is returned, and we’re done. Very simple, right? But it serves the important purpose  architecturally of abstracting away the MailBag client application from the server.  Think of it this way: if you wanted to change the server to use an XML-based message  exchange, and you didn’t want to use Axios, you’d only need to change the code in this  class  and the server, obviously , but the rest of the MailBag client app would be none the  wiser. That’s good architectural flexibility.  i’m going to go through the rest of these methods, as well as those in the   Note  iMap and sMtp Worker classes, pretty quickly, because they follow the same  pattern, which is to mimic the server. no need to linger, i think! But you should  still take the time to examine the code and make sure you do understand what’s  happening, simple though it generally is, for each method presented.   Adding a Contact  To add a contact, the aptly named addContact   method is called, accepting an object  adhering to the IContact interface:  243   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  public async addContact inContact: IContact :   Promise  {   const response: AxiosResponse = await axios.post      `${config.serverAddress} contacts`, inContact    ;   return response.data; }  Once more, it’s a simple Axios call, this time a post  , passing inContact as the   second argument. Axios takes care of serializing that to JSON and sending it in the  request body for us. We get back the same object but now with the _id field added, so  that is returned so the caller can add it to the list of contacts for display  we’ll get into all  of that later .   Deleting a Contact  Deleting a contact is the final bit of functionality this Worker must provide:  public async deleteContact inID : Promise  {   await axios.delete      `${config.serverAddress} contacts ${inID}` ; }  Well, that’s pretty simple, isn’t it? Here, you can see the contact’s ID added to the   URL, as per our REST interface server design.   Mirroring the Server Part 2: IMAP.ts The second Worker to look at is in the IMAP.ts files. Just like with contacts, we begin with  an interface:  export interface IMailbox { name: string, path: string }  And also, just like with contacts, this mimics the interface of the same name found in   the server version of IMAP.ts. Similarly, we have the same IMessage interface as on the  server too:  244   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  export interface IMessage {   id: string, date: string, from: string,subject: string,   body?: string }  After that, the Worker class begins, and we have some methods to look at.   Listing Mailboxes  Listing mailboxes is just like listing contacts in terms of the call to the server, and we find  a similar listMailboxes   method for it:  public async listMailboxes  : Promise  {   const response: AxiosResponse =     await axios.get `${config.serverAddress} mailboxes` ;   return response.data; }  Yep, just a slightly different URL to call and different interfaces, but otherwise, the   same as listing contacts.   Listing Messages  Listing messages in a mailbox is just a trivial thanks to the listMessages   method:  public async listMessages inMailbox: string :   Promise  {   const response: AxiosResponse = await axios.get      `${config.serverAddress} mailboxes ${inMailbox}`    ;   return response.data; }  Here, we just need the path of the mailbox to get messages for, which we get from the   inMailbox argument. Then, it’s just an Axios get   call again.  245   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   Getting the Body of a Message  Remember that the server, when sending a list of messages, does not send the message  bodies. We only get the body of a selected message when needed, and that’s where  getMessageBody   factors in:  public async getMessageBody inID: string, inMailbox: String :   Promise  {   const response: AxiosResponse = await axios.get      `${config.serverAddress} messages ${inMailbox} ${inID}`    ;   return response.data; }  We need the ID of the message and the path to the mailbox it’s in, but other than   that, it’s not substantially different from getting a list of mailboxes.   Deleting a Message  The final method in this Worker is for deleting messages, the deleteMessage   method:  public async deleteMessage inID: string, inMailbox: String :   Promise  {   await axios.delete      `${config.serverAddress} messages ${inMailbox} ${inID}`    ; }  By this point, I’m betting you’re pretty comfortable with these Worker methods and   how they interact with the server. There’s nothing that says I had to mimic the basic  layout of the server code on the client. I could have had a drastically different structure to  these methods here. So long as they eventually call the server as expected, that’s all that  matters. But hopefully, you’ll agree that mirroring them like this helps keep it all straight  in your mind.  246   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   Mirroring the Server Part 3: SMTP.ts The final worker, the one for the SMTP operation of sending a message, is, of course,  found in the SMTP.ts file. In this file, there are no interfaces to deal with, and just a single  method, so the entire file is this:  import axios from "axios"; import { config } from ". config";  export class Worker {    public async sendMessage      inTo: string, inFrom: string, inSubject: string,     inMessage: string    : Promise  {     await axios.post `${config.serverAddress} messages`, {       to : inTo, from : inFrom, subject : inSubject,       text : inMessage     } ;   }  }  I’m going to go out on a limb here and say you probably don’t even need this   explained at this point! So, with that assumption, let’s now move on to the true React  code that makes use of the Workers we just looked at.   A Cavalcade of Components To build a web app usually requires a user interface, and a user interface usually requires  widgets, or components. Sometimes you use the basic ones that HTML itself provides,  and it’s enough. Sometimes, you build your own using those primitives as building  blocks. And, sometimes, you find a good library that suits your needs.  For MailBag, we’ll be doing the latter, and the choice I landed on to provide out   components is Material-UI.  247    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Chapter 9   A Quick Detour: Material-UI Around 2014, Google realized that most of the web app products were going in  different directions in terms of look, feel, and function. Android, too, was a completely  different beast visually, and in fact, Android is where the eventual solution began. They  determined that this wasn’t a sustainable direction to go and they needed to come up  with something to unify their products.  As a result, the Material Design language was created  https:  material.io .   Although it’s not terribly important for our work here, I think a very brief description of  Material Design itself is in order.  Material Design is a set of design principles that are informed by how people interact   with real objects in the physical world. Primarily influenced by print media, Material  Design begins with concepts like sheets of paper and their digital equivalents. When you  read a book, you turn pages, and that motion is encapsulated in Material Design, just as  the underlying pattern of the sheet of paper itself is.  Material Design is concerned with how layers of content can slide over each   other, for example, and those slides, those animations, are key elements. Everything is  intended to be reactive to touch  remember that this all started with Android, at least in  its initial implementation, so touch was automatically a key part of Material Design .  As I said, knowing this doesn’t make a huge difference in our work here, but a little   context never hurt anybody!  Now, what does matter is the Material-UI library itself  https:  material-ui.com .   Simply put, this is a library of React components built on top of Google’s Material Design  language. Being a React library means you simply add it to your project with NPM like  any other library, import the appropriate parts of it, and use it in your code. For example,  if you want to put a button on the screen:  import React from "react"; import Button from "@material-ui core Button";  const App =    =>           Hello World      ;  248   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Now, I’m glossing over something important here, but we’re going to get to it soon   in the section on functional components , but focus on what matters here: React was  imported naturally, and too was the Button component from Material-UI. Then, it’s  simply a matter of dropping a   tag into the code, and we have ourselves a  Material-UI button.  The Material-UI library offers a wealth of components with which to build a user  interface. It has all the usual suspects like buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-  down lists, grids, lists, progress bars, alert dialogs, menus, and a lot more. The web site  referenced in the preceding text does a great job of presenting it all. You’ll find a list of  components with numerous simple examples for each and then links for the API of each  that details the properties and options available.  It really is an easy-to-use library that also makes your apps look and function great  with minimal effort on your part. You’ll only see a small portion of what it has to offer  in MailBag, so I highly encourage you to spend some time on the Material-UI web site  exploring all it has to offer. I think you’ll be very impressed, and it will, I bet, quickly  become your favorite collection of widgets for building UIs with React.   Another Quick Detour: CSS Grid  One of the first questions you must answer when developing a web app is how you’re  going to lay out your components. There are lots of methods, each with their own pluses  and minuses. But, given that we’re trying to use relatively modern techniques in this  book, we’re going to go with the newest darling on the street: CSS Grid.  Virtually any web page layout can be described in terms of a grid  in fact, I’m not   sure there’s any that can’t be . It’s all just columns and rows in the end, whether there’s  only one of each  read: just a single block of content  or whether there are nested grids  inside nested grids. All of it just rows and columns.  Let’s start with some simple markup  Listing 9-1 .  Listing 9-1.  CSS Grid example markup                    249   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client                   A         B         C         D         E         F               When loaded in your browser, you’ll simply see six rows of content, stacked one right   on top of the other, as shown in Figure 9-5.  Figure 9-5.  You can’t see the colors on the printed page, but trust me, they’re there!  To introduce CSS Grid to the mix, in order to create a more interesting layout, we  start with a container element, which we have here. Then, on this element, you define  the grid, that is, the rows and columns contained within the grid. The container element  already has a class attribute, so we just need to define that style rule:  .container {   display : grid;   grid-template-columns : 150px 50px 100px;   grid-template-rows : 100px 100px; }  250   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Now, if you reload the page, you’ll see two rows of items with three columns in   each, as shown in Figure 9-6. The six   elements get dropped into each of the areas  defined by the intersection of the rows and columns.  Figure 9-6.  Our beautiful, beautiful grid!  What’s even better is when you start to add some styling to one or more  ’s to tell   them where in the grid they should live. For example, let’s add some style to element E:   E   Now, reload the page, and you’ll find that the first   shown, E, extends across  the entire grid, as seen in Figure 9-7. The meaning of the grid-column and grid-row  attributes is that it tells the grid what columns and rows the element should cover, but it  does so using the grid lines, not the boxes that make up the grid.  251   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Figure 9-7.  A more interesting grid  well, I think so at least!   In other words, when you have three columns, you have four grid lines: the two   between the three columns, of course, and the one before the first column and after the  last one. So, here we’re saying that this   should stretch from that first grid line to  the fourth one, the last one, which results in it covering the entire row. Figure 9-8 should,  expect, make this all clear.  Figure 9-8.  The numbers across the top are the column lines; the ones down the  side are the row lines  252   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Also, because   E now takes up the entire first row,  ’s A, B, and C use the   second row, which pushes D and F down. Sometimes, it takes a little tweaking to get your  grid to work precisely the way you want it to, but when you do, you’ll find that laying out  pages is a piece of cake with CSS Grid.  It’s also important to realize that you can nest grid. So say we want to have some   grid layout within   B, we can absolutely do that, and you do it in exactly the same  way: apply the display:grid style to a container    along with the grid-template-  columns and grid-template-rows as appropriate  inside   B and then define the grid  in exactly the same way, but now that grid will be constrained to   B. And it’s exactly  this nesting that will allow us to lay out the MailBag UI as shown earlier, as you’ll see in  action shortly.   Yet Another Quick Detour: main.css  In the source code for this app, you’ll find the main.css file in the src css directory. This  is an ordinary CSS stylesheet, absolutely nothing special about it. Usually, I would go  through it here, but I think it will make much more sense to look at the relatively small  handful of CSS rules it contains in context as we go through the various components.  So, that’s precisely what I’m going to do! And, given that, we can move on to the code   of BaseLayout.tsx.   BaseLayout.tsx Earlier, I mentioned that a single React component will be the parent to all the others, as is  always the case, and now it’s time to look at it: BaseLayout, as found in BaseLayout.tsx:  class BaseLayout extends Component {  First, we start by creating a class that extends React’s Component class. Next, we have   to get the state into the component, as discussed earlier:  state = createState this ;  Hopefully, you’re having a “Eureka!” moment right about now. This is where   createState   is called, and a reference to the BaseLayout instance itself is passed in so  that all the state mutator methods can be bound to it.  253   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  After that, we come to the one method we know must be present: render  :  render   {   return          Remember that we’re going to be doing the layout of the UI via CSS Grid, so that   means that whatever element is at the very top of the page must be our container  element, and so it is: a   with the appContainer class applied. That class, found in  main.css  as they all are , is as follows:  .appContainer {   display : grid;   grid-template-columns : 150px 1fr 240px;   grid-template-rows : 50px 1fr;   width : 100vw;   height : 100vh; }  That’s just like the example from earlier as far as defining the grid goes, but now  you see width and height set using vw and vh units, respectively. The v in those units  stands for viewport. So what we’re really saying is “make this container element 100%  of the width and height of the viewport.” In other words, our grid fills the screen, which,  of course, is what we want for MailBag  in contrast to the earlier CSS Grid examples  where that wasn’t the case, the grid used only as much space as was specified in its style  definition .  Next, we need to define the please wait popup, and for it, we’ll use a Dialog   component, supplied by Material-UI:  <Dialog open={ this.state.pleaseWaitVisible }   disableBackdropClick={ true }   disableEscapeKeyDown={ true }   transitionDuration={ 0 }>         Please Wait      254   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client           ...Contacting server...         It may seem odd that something like a popup dialog, something that is transient,   actually exists at all times and is just hidden and shown, but that’s a common thing with  React. Here, the open prop gets its value from the pleaseWaitVisible property in state,  which you’ll recall from earlier I said to keep in mind. When the hideShowPleaseWait    state mutator method is called, that property gets changed, and React notices that. So it  will re-render the page, now either hiding or showing this dialog based on the changed  prop value.  We don’t want this dialog to be dismissible by the user, which it would be by default.   So, the disableBackdropClick prop is set to true, which stops the user from clicking  outside of the dialog to dismiss. Additionally, disableEscapeKeyDown is also set to true  to prevent them from pressing the ESC key to dismiss it. I also set transitionDuration  to 0 so that the animation that it normally does by default doesn’t occur, since the call to  the server, in some cases, could actually be faster than the transition itself! Indeed, it’s  expected that, in most cases, this dialog will appear and disappear so fast that the user  will just see a flash. But, for times when the network is a bit slower, it’s nice to have   it there.  The actual Dialog has as a child a DialogTitle component, and here I set style so  that its text is centered  which I just thought looked better  and a DialogContent child,  which itself has a DialogContentText child. This is simply the text displayed in the  Dialog itself. As an aside, the Material-UI Dialog component is much more robust and  can have buttons you define, or even input elements, virtually anything you can imagine  can wind up in a Dialog. It doesn’t need to be simple static text as here, but since that’s  all we need, that’s all it is in this case.  With the please wait popup defined, it’s finally time to start defining the UI that is   always visible, starting with the toolbar:           255   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Notice the pattern here, which you’ll see throughout this component: state is passed   down to the Toolbar component  the definition of which we’ll see in the next section .  Every component that is a child to BaseLayout, save for one  WelcomeView , needs state,  and they all get it the same way. That’s the other half of what I was talking about earlier  in terms of choosing the right component to contain state: just putting the state in a  component higher up the component tree doesn’t do much unless you pass that state to  child components as needed.  Now, as far as the toolbar style rule goes, that’s as follows:  .toolbar {   grid-column : 1   4;   grid-row : 1   1;   border-bottom : 1px solid e0e0e0;   padding-top : 8px;   padding-left : 4px; }  As you can see, we want the toolbar to stretch across the three columns of the   grid, just like in the earlier example. I also add some padding to keep the buttons from  touching the edges of the screen on the left and top  again, it just looks better to my eyes  that way . I also added a border on the bottom to give some separation from the rest of  the UI contents  this, too, is a pattern repeated throughout .  Next, we need our list of mailboxes on the left:           Hopefully, you’re seeing the pattern now! Ignoring for the moment what the   MailboxList component is and how it’s implemented, the basic idea is the same as for  the Toolbar. The mailboxList style rule BaseLayout is  .mailboxList {   grid-column : 1   1;   grid-row : 2   2;   border-right : 1px solid e0e0e0;   padding-top : 6px;  256   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client    padding-left : 4px;   overflow : auto; }  That’s not much different from the toolbar style rule either, with the exception of   overflow set to auto to ensure that the list can scroll if there are more mailboxes than the  vertical space allows for.  Next up is the area of the screen below the toolbar and in between the mailbox list on   the left and contact list on the right – the center area!                   This is a situation where we’re going to be nesting CSS Grids, so while the outer     is the content of the second column in the second row of the top-level grid, we  also need the contents within this   to have its own grid structure. The centerArea  style rule defines that:  Here, we only need two rows, we don’t need any columns, so it’s a simpler definition.   The first row in this sub-grid, so to speak, is the MessageList component, our list of  messages in the selected mailbox in other words. So, we need to place it in this sub-grid,  and the messageList style rule does that:  .centerArea {   display : grid;   grid-template-rows : 200px 1fr; }  .messageList {   border-bottom : 1px solid e0e0e0;   grid-row : 1   1;   overflow : auto; }  Pretty simple, right? Once again, we need this area to scroll, since a message list can   be arbitrarily long, so overflow is again set to auto.  257   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Next up is the second row of this sub-grid, and this is what I’ve termed the “view   area.” It’s where the contact and message views will go, plus the welcome view. Which is  showing depends on the state of the app, so we’re going to need some logic for React to  determine which to render:      { this.state.currentView === "welcome" &&   }   {  this.state.currentView === "message"      this.state.currentView === "compose"  &&         }   {  this.state.currentView === "contact"      this.state.currentView === "contactAdd"  &&         }    Here is a bit of a trick that is very common in React code: if you want to conditionally  render or not render a component, usually based on some value in state, you can use the  general syntax:  {   ===   &&   }  Remember that { } denotes an expression in JSX syntax. Also remember that in   JavaScript, && is a short-circuit boolean and operation. That means that whatever is on  the right of it will only be evaluated if what’s on the left is true. Therefore, here, if the  boolean outcome on the left is false, then the component won’t be rendered because it  won’t even be evaluated.  So, for the   component to render, for example, the currentView  property in state must equal "welcome". If it doesn’t, then React won’t render that  component. For the MessageView component to render, currentView must be "message"  or "compose"  the view does double duty for both of those, as you’ll see later . Finally, for  ContactView to render, currentView must be "contact" or "contactAdd". In the end,  we’ll only ever get one of these components rendered as a result, so only one view will  ever be shown, and changing currentView in state will allow us to flip between these  views. Pretty nifty, right?  258   What about the centerViews style rule? That’s easy:  Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  That places this content in the second row of the sub-grid and provides some   padding about it to avoid any of its content bunching up on the edges.  Finally, we have only one more component to place, and that’s the list of contacts on   .centerViews {   grid-row : 2   2;   padding-top : 4px;   padding-left : 4px;   padding-right : 4px;   overflow : auto; }  the right:           And, of course, its associated style rule:  .contactList {   grid-column : 3   3;   grid-row : 2   2;   border-left : 1px solid e0e0e0;   padding-top : 4px;   padding-left : 4px;   overflow : auto; }  Finally, of course, we need to export this component:  export default BaseLayout;  And with that, our BaseLayout component is done! Now, let’s look at the individual   components that we just saw used – well, right after one last quick detour, that is!  Note  each of the remaining components has a single export at the end, just like  BaseLayout, but i’m going to skip showing you that over and over again.  259    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Chapter 9   A Quick Detour: Functional Components In the previous Material-UI example, I dropped a little bit of coolness on you out of the  blue, something called functional React components. In the past, and with BaseLayout,  you’ve seen components defined this way:  class Welcome extends React.Component {   render   { return  Hello, { this.props.name } ; } }  Sometimes Component is written React.Component, but it’s the same thing, it’s just  a question of how your imports are done. Either way, what’s important to remember,  though, is that, fundamentally, a React component is just an object with a render    method at minimum. And recall that the syntax you see here is JSX. Because of that, you  can also define this component in a more concise form:  const Welcome =    =>    Hello, { this.props.name }   ;  Using functional syntax like this works because JSX is aware of it and can process   it. It’s clearly not valid JavaScript because if you tried to have HTML embedded in a  function like that, it simply wouldn’t work. But JSX allows you to do just that. A valid   component will be created, and the HTML you see there, the component tree it  represents to be more precise, will be returned from an automatically created render    method.  Why would you choose the class-based approach over the functional approach?   There are two primary reasons, beyond whether you prefer the brevity of the functional  code or not: lifecycle event needs and state needs. If you need access to lifecycle events,  then you can’t use the functional approach – at least, not without introducing the topics  of Hooks, which is something that was added a little later in React, and something I’m  not covering in this book because it’s a bit of a more advanced topic and not a necessary  component of React coding. The same is true of state: if you need your component to  have its own state, then you’ll need to use the class-based approach  but again, Hooks  provides a solution here too .  However, note that with state, it’s possible to hoist the state up to a component   higher in the component tree and then pass it into the component. So, in a sense, the  state limitation is no limitation at all, even before you get into Hooks. You’ll be seeing  exactly this approach in MailBag because the state object discussed earlier is used in  exactly this fashion.  260   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   Toolbar.tsx Now, back to our components, beginning with the Toolbar component, found in the  Toolbar.tsx file, which is defined in a functional way just described:  const Toolbar =  { state }  =>            <Button variant="contained" color="primary"       size="small" style={{ marginRight:10 }}       onClick={    => state.showComposeMessage "new"  } >        New Message           <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"       style={{ marginRight:10 }}       onClick={ state.showAddContact } >        New Contact             ;  At a high level, it’s a simple component: it just has two Button components in it,   courtesy of the Material-UI library. The Button component has several options to change  how it looks and functions, and here I’ve used its variant=“contained” to make it look  like a more traditional button rather than the text-only buttons that are common on  Android  it has elevation and fill in this form, to be more precise . I also set the color  to primary, which, by default, will give it a blue appearance. The size=“small” prop  makes the buttons smaller than usual, to gain a bit more space in the UI. For the NEW  MESSAGE button, I also added a margin on the right so that there would be separation  between it and the NEW CONTACT button.  Within each Button is an icon, also provided by Material-UI. The library contains   numerous icons, and most have their own components, as NewMessageIcon and  NewContactIcon do. For each, I also again add margin on the right so that the icon has  space between it and the text. And, speaking of text, that’s the second child of each  Button, just literally static text.  261   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  A button without some sort of click handler code wouldn’t be of much use, so both  buttons have such a handler hook up to it through the onClick prop. In the case of the  NEW MESSAGE button, there is an anonymous function defined, and from it, state. showComposeMessage   is called. This is necessary because the "new" value needs to be  passed to it in order to indicate that the MessageView component, which we’ll look at later,  should display in the new message composition mode. When the user clicks a message in  the message list, by contrast, the same view is shown, but there will be different fields and  buttons, and what is passed to showComposeMessage   determines all that.  In fact, here is that method now:  showComposeMessage : function inType: string : void {   switch  inType  {     case "new":       this.setState { currentView : "compose",         messageTo : "", messageSubject : "", messageBody : "",         messageFrom : config.userEmail       } ;     break;     case "reply":       this.setState { currentView : "compose",         messageTo : this.state.messageFrom,         messageSubject : `Re: ${this.state.messageSubject}`,         messageBody : messageFrom : config.userEmail,           `\n\n---- Original Message ----            \n\n${this.state.messageBody}`       } ;     break;     case "contact":       this.setState { currentView : "compose",         messageTo : this.state.contactEmail,         messageSubject : "", messageBody : "",         messageFrom : config.userEmail       } ;     break;   } }.bind inParentComponent   262   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  As you can see, there are three possibilities. The first, for a value of "new", is when  the user wants to compose a brand-new message. In all three cases, the goal is to set  currentView in state so that the appropriate view is shown  "compose" in all cases   and to set up any state properties as necessary. For the "new" case, that means clearing  out the messageTo, messageSubject, messageBody, and messageFrom fields. The first  three will be populated by the user when they enter the values on the compose view   something you’ll see a bit later , and messageFrom is set from what’s in the config  object.  Second, when the user clicks the REPLY button when viewing a message, it’s still   ultimately the "compose" view we want to go to, but now we pre-fill the messageTo,  messageSubject, and messageBody variables in state.  Third, the "contact" case is when the user clicks the Send Email button when  viewing a contact. It’s just like the "reply" state except that the messageTo property  comes from the contact itself while messageSubject and messageBody are blanked out.  Now, going back to our Toolbar, the second button, NEW CONTACT, doesn’t need to  do this sort of logic. As a result, there’s no need for an anonymous function like for NEW  MESSAGE. Instead, we can reference the state.showAddContact   method directly, and  that method is  showAddContact : function  : void {   this.setState { currentView : "contactAdd",   contactID : null, contactName : "", contactEmail : "" } ; }.bind inParentComponent   Once again, it’s just a case of setting currentView appropriately and clearing out any  state properties that are involved in user input. In this case, the contact won’t have an ID  until we save it to the server, so contactID is null, while contactName and contactEmail  start off as empty strings, which will be reflected initially in the text fields that the user  will enter the values in.  Note  For the remainder of these components, i’m just going to show the content  of the function, since that’s all that’s different in them, aside from the obvious of  the component’s name and export.  263    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Chapter 9   MailboxList.tsx Next, we’ll look at the MailboxList component from the MailboxList.tsx file:      state.mailboxes.map value => {     return                   state.setCurrentMailbox value.path        }         style={{ width:128, marginBottom:10 }}         color={ state.currentMailbox === value.path ?           "secondary" : "primary" }  >      ;    }   }    It all begins with a Material-UI List component. Material-UI has several   components for displaying collections of data in various ways, and List is one of them,  and perhaps the most used. Within it, you have one or more child components, one per  item in your list.  The list of mailboxes is, of course, in the mailboxes array property of the state   object, so we use the map   function on that array to process each item. For each  element, a Chip component is returned, which is again a component from Material-UI.   A Chip is a lot like a Button, and in fact, for how it’s used here, a Button could have been  just as good. Typically, Chips are used to represent things like contacts, but there are no  real rules for their use. They look a bit different than buttons, which is why I went with it   that, and just to show you a different component!  But, at the end of the day, each Chip  has some label text, which is the name of the mailbox, some styling to set its size and  ensure spacing between them, and color. The color prop is interesting because we want  the currently selected mailbox to be a different color. The state.currentMailbox stores  the path of the currently selected mailbox, so we can do some logic to set the color. If the  path of the element of the array being processed is the same as currentMailbox, then  the secondary color will be used, which is red. Otherwise, the primary color  blue  will  be used. As long as currentMailbox changes when a mailbox Chip is clicked, then we’ll  get the highlighting of the current mailbox as we want.  264   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  And speaking of clicking a Chip, the onClick handler is defined pointing to state. setCurrentMailbox   for that purpose. Again, because we need to pass the path of the  clicked mailbox to that method, we need to use an anonymous function to call state. setCurrentMailbox  , the code for which is  if you tried to set onClick={ state.setCurrentMailbox } to avoid   Note  the anonymous function, then what would be passed to it would be an event  object. While it might be possible to drill down into that object to get at the path of  the mailbox, using the anonymous function approach decouples the code a little  bit from react or even the browser event model in general and, in my mind, makes  what’s happening clearer.  setCurrentMailbox : function inPath: String : void {   this.setState { currentView : "welcome",     currentMailbox : inPath } ;   this.state.getMessages inPath ; }.bind inParentComponent   Sure enough, we can see that currentMailbox is indeed set, which highlights it once  React sees that state change and re-renders the appropriate part of the component tree.  The currentView is also changed to "welcome" because until the user selects a message,  there’s nothing to show in the view area, and any time that situation arises, I defaulted it  to the welcome view.  The other thing that should occur at this point is that the list of messages in the   mailbox, if any, should be retrieved. This is accomplished by the getMessages   method:  getMessages : async function inPath: string : Promise  {   this.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;   const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker  ;   const messages: IMAP.IMessage[] = await imapWorker.listMessages inPath ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait false ;   this.state.clearMessages  ;   messages.forEach  inMessage: IMAP.IMessage  => {     this.state.addMessageToList inMessage ;   } ; }.bind inParentComponent   265   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  Note that this also means that the user can click the current mailbox Chip any time   they like to refresh the list. The getMessages   method first shows the please wait  dialog, then uses the IMAP.Worker class to call the server for the list of messages. Once  returned, the first thing to do is to clear any current list of messages, which is where the  clearMessages   method comes in:  clearMessages : function  : void {   this.setState { messages : [ ] } ; }.bind inParentComponent   It’s a simple matter of setting a blank array into state for the messages property. Then,  for each mailbox object returned, it is added to the list of mailboxes just cleared, via a call  to addMessagestoList  :  addMessageToList : function inMessage: IMAP.IMessage : void {   const cl = this.state.messages.slice 0 ;   cl.push { id : inMessage.id, date : inMessage.date,     from : inMessage.from, subject : inMessage.subject } ;   this.setState { messages : cl } ; }.bind inParentComponent   As you’ve seen before, the list of mailboxes is copied first, then a new item pushed   into it, an object constructed from the object passed in. Once again, just adding  inMessage to the array would be okay, but doing it this way provides more flexibility it  we want to alter the object at all. Finally, the updated array is passed to setState  , and  React does its thing to update the list of messages.   ContactList.tsx While it might seem most logical at this point to jump into the message list and message  view code, I want to save those for a little later just because it’s where most of the  complexity  relatively speaking  is. Instead, I want to hit on the two contact-related  pieces of code first, starting with the ContactList component itself, in the ContactList. tsx file, which is the list of contacts on the right-hand side of the screen:  266   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client      {state.contacts.map value => {     return                   state.showContact value._id,           value.name, value.email                 }>                                                          ;   } }    As with the mailbox list, we have a List component. But, unlike the mailbox list,   which just had a series of Chip components as children, here, we’re going to use some  components that are more typically used within a List. Here, you have one or more  child components of type ListItem. In this case, the items come from the array of  contacts in state, so like with mailboxes, map   is used to iterate them. For each, a  ListItem is created. Every ListItem must have a unique key, though what the value  is isn’t something List defines – it’s up to us. So, in this case, I simply make it the next  contact object from the contacts array itself. Then, for each, an onClick handler prop is  attached that calls state.showContact  , passing it the unique ID of the contact along  with the name and email properties.  The showContact   method is this:  showContact : function inID: string, inName: string, inEmail: string : void {   this.setState { currentView : "contact", contactID : inID,     contactName : inName, contactEmail : inEmail } ; }.bind inParentComponent   267   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  As you can see, currentView is set to "contact" and the three values passed in are   set in the corresponding state properties. That way, when the contact view is shown,  which we’ll be looking at next, the contact’s name and email address are showing.  Backing up a bit, the List component and its child ListItem components don’t   define what the look of an individual item in the list is. You are free to do whatever  you like. So, I use another Material-UI component, ListItemAvatar, which is used to  display an avatar, usually a small image of some sort, for each contact. ListItemAvatar  demands an Avatar child that is the image to display. If we had real avatar images for  each contact, we could insert it here  hint: that’d make a good suggested exercise! . But,  here, I make each contact have the same image, using the Person icon that Material-UI  supplies. Finally, I want to put the name of the contact next to the image, so for that, we  add a ListItemText component. The primary prop is the text to show  there is also a  secondary prop you could use to, perhaps, show the email address below the name .   ContactView.tsx When a contact in the contact list is clicked or the NEW CONTACT button in the toolbar  is clicked, the contact view is shown in the view area. This content is provided by the  ContactView component in the ContactView.tsx file, and it begins thusly  “thusly”?  Who talks like that?! :  Strictly speaking, the form isn’t necessary. But remember that render   must always  return a single element  and that doesn’t change when using the functional component  approach – the code here still winds up in a render   method , whether it has children  or not. While a   would work just as well here, I thought  , given its children,  made sense.  For its children, we begin with a Material-UI TextField:  <TextField margin="dense" id="contactName" label="Name"   value={ state.contactName } variant="outlined"   InputProps={{ style : { color : "000000" } }}   disabled={ state.currentView === "contact" }   style={{ width:260 }}   onChange={ state.fieldChangeHandler }  >     268   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  As the name implies, the TextField allows users to enter text. Here, we’re looking   for the contact’s name. The margin prop set to dense reduces the space around the field,  purely a visual choice in this instance. Similarly, setting variant to outlined results in  the field having the border around it, which I felt looked better, rather than being just a  single line, which is the default look. The label prop is, of course, the text that tells you  what field this is  and which moves above the field from inside it as soon as you start  typing, which is a nice Material-ish thing to do . The value comes from state, just like  you’d expect, whether it’s an empty string in the case of creating a new contact or the  contact’s name when selecting one from the list. The InputProps prop is used to style  the underlying HTML   element, which is what provides the base functionality  that Material-UI then builds upon. The problem here is that when a TextField is  disabled, which is done by setting the disabled prop  which here is true when state. currentView is "contact" because that’s what it will be when the user clicked a contact  in the list and so is viewing the contact in a non-editable mode , the text is a gray color.  That makes it hard to read. So, by explicitly setting the color to black  000000 , that  problem is solved, and it remains readable. I also set an explicit width for the field, one  large enough to support the maximum characters allowed.  You may be wondering  a  why I skipped the id prop and  b  how the field knows   what the maximum length is, because it’s not defined here. The answer is in the  onChange handler that’s attached:  fieldChangeHandler : function inEvent: any : void {   if  inEvent.target.id === "contactName" &&     inEvent.target.value.length > 16  { return; }   this.setState { [inEvent.target.id] :     inEvent.target.value } ; }.bind inParentComponent     This handler is used on all the editable fields in MailBag, in fact, and you can see   where the id prop matters here. If you recall from earlier when discussing the mailbox  list, I mentioned that if you don’t use an anonymous function in the event handler and  instead reference the state mutator method directly, then you’ll wind up getting an  event object passed in. For that situation, that was problematic, but here it’s perfect  because the target attribute of the event object is the component triggering the event.  That includes the id prop value. So, we can start by checking if this is the contactName   269   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  field based on the id. If it is, and if the length of the value passed in is greater than 16,  which is our maximum name length, then we return immediately. That effectively limits  the maximum length of the field. If there’s still room, or this isn’t the contactName field,  then the id again comes into play because we use it to set the appropriate state property.  If you look back at the state object, you’ll find that the fields associated with editing a  contact match the id’s used on the TextFields in this code. This is similarly true for the  MessageView later. The result is that we have a generic event handler that can be used for  all these TextFields, and that will mutate the correct property on the state object.  Note that a   element follows the TextField; otherwise, the two TextFields   here would be on the same line. And, speaking of both TextFields, here’s the next, this  one for entering the eMail address:  <TextField margin="dense" id="contactEmail" label="Email"   value={ state.contactEmail } variant="outlined"   InputProps={{ style : { color:"000000" } }} disabled={   state.currentView === "contact" } style={{ width:520 }}   onChange={ state.fieldChangeHandler }  >    As you can see, aside from the id and label and the width, it’s the same as the name  field  there’s no maximum length for this field so nothing to consider there – the width is  simply arbitrary . So, let’s move on to the next thing in this code:  { state.currentView === "contactAdd" &&   <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"     style={{ marginTop:10 }} onClick={ state.saveContact }>     Save     }  As in BaseLayout, the conditional render trick is used here because the SAVE button   should only be visible when we’re adding a contact. Otherwise, this is a Material-UI  button as you’ve seen before, so let’s go explore its click handler, saveContact  , in the  state object:  saveContact : async function  : Promise  {   const cl = this.state.contacts.slice 0 ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;  270   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client    const contactsWorker: Contacts.Worker = new Contacts.Worker  ;   const contact: Contacts.IContact = await contactsWorker.addContact {       name : this.state.contactName,       email : this.state.contactEmail } ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait false ;   cl.push contact ;   this.setState { contacts : cl, contactID : null,     contactName : "", contactEmail : "" } ; }.bind inParentComponent   We begin, as you’ve seen a few times before, copying the contacts array. Next, the   please wait dialog is shown, and then a call to Contacts.Worker.addContact   is made,  passing it an object formed from the contactName and contactEmail fields in state,  whose values will have been set when the user typed them in the two TextFields from  before. When that call comes back, please wait is hidden, the returned contact  which  now includes the _id field  is pushed into the contacts array, and finally setState    is called to update the array. I also clear out the properties associated with editing a  contact so that the field is clear, in case the user wants to add another contact right away.  After that, we have two more buttons to deal with:  { state.currentView === "contact" &&   <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"     style={{ marginTop:10, marginRight:10 }}     onClick={ state.deleteContact }>     Delete     } { state.currentView === "contact" &&   <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"     style={{ marginTop:10 }}     onClick={    => state.showComposeMessage "contact"  }>     Send Email     }  271   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  These two are only shown when a contact has been clicked from the list, and they   provide the user the opportunity to delete the contact or send a new eMail to them. Note  that for both, I added some margin on the top to separate them from the eMail field,  and for the DELETE button, I also have some on the right so the buttons themselves  don’t bunch up. For the DELETE button, the onClick handler can point directly at the  deleteContact   method in the state object because that method will already have  access to everything it needs to do the delete  namely, the contactID property in state ,  but for sending an eMail, we need to know the source of the action, as you saw earlier,  hence why we need to use the anonymous function approach here.  As far as that deleteContact   goes, here it is:  deleteContact : async function  : Promise  {   this.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;   const contactsWorker: Contacts.Worker = new Contacts.Worker  ;   await contactsWorker.deleteContact this.state.contactID ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait false ;   const cl = this.state.contacts.filter       inElement  => inElement._id != this.state.contactID    ;   this.setState { contacts : cl, contactID : null,     contactName : "", contactEmail : "" } ; }.bind inParentComponent   It’s much the same as what you’ve seen before: show please wait, call server via   Contacts.Worker.deleteContact   method, and then remove it from the list. To  remove it, we must find it first. The filter   method of the contacts array in state  allows us to do that. For each element in the array, the function we provide to filter    is executed and is passed the next element. If the _id property of the element isn’t  state.contactID, then true is returned, which filter   takes to mean we want the  element included in the new array that it’s constructing. Simply put, all elements in  state.contacts will be copied into the new array cl except for the contact being deleted.  What that new array built, we can pass it to setState  , which results in React re-  rendering the list, sans that contact. As with adding a contact, the contact editing-related  properties in state are cleared, and we’re done.  272   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   MessageList.tsx Next up is the message list, which means the MessageList component in the  MessageList.tsx file. Here’s pretty much the whole thing:                     Date         From         Subject                    { state.messages.map message =>         <TableRow key={ message.id }         onClick={    => state.showMessage message  }>                    { new Date message.date .toLocaleDateString   }                    { message.from }           { message.subject }                  }        The Table component is another Material-UI component for displaying data like  List that you saw earlier, but this one essentially mimics an HTML table. That’s ideal  for the message list because it should look like a typical table, or grid as it’s sometimes  called. We have a header row, which we want to ensure stays “stuck” at the top even if  you user scrolls to see the list, and that’s what the stickyHeader prop set to true does  for us. Then we have three columns, one each for Date, From, and Subject. So, inside  the Table component goes firstly a TableHead component, which demarks the header.  Inside that is a TableRow, since the header row is, in fact, a row like any other despite it  being the header. Finally, inside that TableRow goes three TableCell components, one   273   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  for each column in the table. The first two have specific widths assigned, which will  cause the third, the Subject column, so take up the remaining horizontal space.  After the TableHead comes a TableBody, again, just like a plain old HTML table.   Inside the TableBody goes a TableRow for each message. We iterate the list of messages  found in state.messages with map   like you’ve seen for mailboxes and contacts. For  each of the three data elements to display, we drop a TableCell into the TableRow and  render the appropriate properties from the message object into it. That’s about all there  is to it!  You’ll also, no doubt, notice that there is an onClick prop on the TableRow housing  the message. When the row is clicked, we need to display in the view area below, which  is what the showMessage   state mutator method does:  showMessage : async function inMessage: IMAP.IMessage : Promise  {   this.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;   const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker  ;   const mb: String = await imapWorker.getMessageBody      inMessage.id, this.state.currentMailbox    ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait false ;   this.setState { currentView : "message",     messageID : inMessage.id, messageDate : inMessage.date,     messageFrom : inMessage.from,     messageTo : "", messageSubject : inMessage.subject,     messageBody : mb   } ; }.bind inParentComponent   Once the please wait popup is shown, the IMAP.Worker.getMessageBody   method  is called, passing it the ID of the message and the path of the current mailbox. The server  is called, the body returned, and please wait hidden. Finally, the setState   call is made  to change the view and populate all the message details, including the body. The result  is that the message is displayed, all pertinent details visible to the user in the view area  below the message list.  274   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client   MessageView.tsx MessageView is perhaps the most complex of all the components, and even it isn’t  anything that’ll hurt your brain! It all begins with a plain old HTML form:     As with ContactView, we need a single container for fields here, and a   again   makes sense, though it doesn’t need to be a   element.  Speaking of the fields that follow:  { state.currentView === "message" &&   <InputBase defaultValue={ `ID ${state.messageID}` }     margin="dense" disabled={ true } fullWidth={ true }     className="messageInfoField"  > } { state.currentView === "message" &&   }  First, we need a field to display the ID of the message. Since this isn’t something that   will ever be editable, a TextField isn’t needed. And, while it certainly could have just  been a plain old  , I decided to use another Material-UI component, just to give you  a little more exposure to it. The InputBase component serves as the basis for many of  Material-UI’s form field components and provides a minimal set of style rest and state  logic. It’s perfect for our purposes because it looks an awful lot like TextField from an  API standpoint, but is a bit simpler. The defaultValue prop is the message ID, prefixed  with a static “ID” text to serve as a label of sorts. The margin prop is again set to dense  to reduce space around it and the field should always be disabled, so that prop is set to  true. The fullWidth prop, set to true, stretched the field across the entire width of its  container, which ensures we always have enough space to display the content. Finally,  a little bit of styling is needed, but this time it’s done with a className prop rather than  inlining the styles, and that leads us to the last style rule in our main.css file:  .messageInfoField {   color : 000000!important; }  275   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  That serves much the same purpose as the styling on the TextFields you saw earlier   to make the text readable when the field is disabled. Note that appending !important  was required here to get the color to override the default gray color, not an uncommon  thing to have to do with CSS.  After that comes another InputBase component, this time for the message’s date:  { state.currentView === "message" &&   <InputBase defaultValue={ state.messageDate } margin="dense"     disabled={ true } fullWidth={ true }     className="messageInfoField"  > } { state.currentView === "message" &&   }  Of course, conditional rendering is used to only show these fields with currentView  is "message", that is, when viewing an existing message, as opposed to when this view is  shown for composing a message.  One last field remains after that:  { state.currentView === "message" &&   <TextField margin="dense" variant="outlined"     fullWidth={ true } label="From"     value={ state.messageFrom }     disabled={ true }     InputProps={{ style : { color : "000000" } }}  > } { state.currentView === "message" &&   }  The From field is again only shown when viewing an existing message, and like the  previous two InputBase fields, this one stretches across the entire container thanks to  fullWidth being set to true. Of course, this field is never editable, hence disabled set to  true with no logic.  Now we get into some fields that are shown only when composing a message:  { state.currentView === "compose" &&   <TextField margin="dense" id="messageTo" variant="outlined"     fullWidth={ true } label="To"     value={ state.messageTo }  276   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client      InputProps={{ style : { color : "000000" } }}     onChange={ state.fieldChangeHandler }  > }  The To field is obviously needed, and like From, we stretch it across the entire   container to allow the user as much room to enter long addresses as possible. You can  see our friendly neighborhood state.fieldChangeHandler   method again being used,  which means that the id here must match the state property that should get the value of  whatever the user enters here, which it does.  Then, we need a subject field:  { state.currentView === "compose" &&   } <TextField margin="dense" id="messageSubject" label="Subject"   variant="outlined" fullWidth={ true }   value={ state.messageSubject }   disabled={ state.currentView === "message" }   InputProps={{ style : { color : "000000" } }}   onChange={ state.fieldChangeHandler }  >    There’s nothing new there frankly, so let’s move on to the field where the user will   enter the actual text of the message:  <TextField margin="dense" id="messageBody" variant="outlined"   fullWidth={ true } multiline={ true } rows={ 12 }   value={ state.messageBody }   disabled={ state.currentView === "message" }   InputProps={{ style : { color : "000000" } }}   onChange={ state.fieldChangeHandler }  >  Ah, here we have a few new props! When multiline is set to true, Material-UI will  render an HTML   under the covers. That implies that we can set rows and  cols value, and we can, though only rows is used here because fullWidth is set to true.  So, what we wind up with is a   that fills the entire available horizontal space  and allows for 12 rows of text to be input  it will, of course, scroll to accommodate more  as necessary, as a   does by default . Other than that, though, this is the same  as the other fields.  277   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  After the fields, we must work on the buttons that we need, beginning with the one to   send the message being composed:  { state.currentView === "compose" &&   <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"     style={{ marginTop:10 }}     onClick={ state.sendMessage }>   Send   }  That’s a pretty straightforward Button component, isn’t it? Given there’s nothing  new, let’s jump right to that sendMessage   state method referenced in the onClick  prop:  sendMessage : async function  : Promise  {   this.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;   const smtpWorker: SMTP.Worker = new SMTP.Worker  ;   await smtpWorker.sendMessage this.state.messageTo,     this.state.messageFrom, this.state.messageSubject,     this.state.messageBody    ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait false ;   this.setState { currentView : "welcome" } ; }.bind inParentComponent   Again, this code is very much like other methods you’ve seen. We show the please   wait dialog; call the appropriate Worker method, passing it the properties from state  that will have been populated as the user typed values into the fields, thanks to that  fieldChangeHandler   method; hide please wait; and finally change the view to the  welcome view, since it doesn’t make much sense to go somewhere else or even to stay  on the compose view at that point.  Next, we have a button that only shows up when the user clicks a message from the   message list, namely, the one to reply to the message:  { state.currentView === "message" &&   <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"     style={{ marginTop:10, marginRight:10 }}  278   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client      onClick={    => state.showComposeMessage "reply"  }>     Reply     }  For all intents and purposes, it’s the same as the NEW MESSAGE button in the   toolbar, but the one difference is that showComposeMessage   must be called and passed  a different value, so it’s anonymous function time again! And, of course, this button is  only shown when state.currentView is "message", not when it’s "compose".  Similarly, the last button to deal with, DELETE, is also only shown when viewing an   existing message from the message list:  { state.currentView === "message" &&   <Button variant="contained" color="primary" size="small"     style={{ marginTop:10 }}     onClick={ state.deleteMessage }>     Delete     }  By this point, you should have a very good handle on Material-UI Buttons, right? I   expect so! Therefore, it’s time for the final method in state, the deleteMessage   method,  hooked to this button via its onClick prop:  deleteMessage : async function  : Promise  {   this.state.showHidePleaseWait true ;   const imapWorker: IMAP.Worker = new IMAP.Worker  ;   await imapWorker.deleteMessage      this.state.messageID, this.state.currentMailbox    ;   this.state.showHidePleaseWait false ;   const cl = this.state.messages.filter       inElement  => inElement.id != this.state.messageID    ;   this.setState { messages : cl, currentView : "welcome" } ; }.bind inParentComponent   279   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client  This is very much the same as the deleteContact   method, except that it calls   IMAP.Worker.deleteMessage   of course, passing it the message’s ID and the path to the  current mailbox, and then filtering the state.messages array to remove it from the list.  We have just one more component left to examine, and here it comes!   WelcomeView.tsx I saved perhaps the simplest component for last – WelcomeView:  <div style={{   position:"relative", top:"40%", textAlign:"center",   color:"ff0000" }}>    Welcome to MailBag!     Yep, that’s literally it! The styling here serves to center the text  well, it’s actually a   hair closer to the top than the bottom, which I think looks a little better  and then just a  big, red   element.  And that, my friend, is MailBag, all done and ready to serve your email needs!   Suggested Exercises As with the server, I’ve left some things that you could do to enhance the MailBag client  app that I think would serve as excellent learning experiences to put what you’ve learned  to the test:     Did you notice that all emails are treated as plain text, whether they  are or not? Wouldn’t it be nice to see HTML messages displayed as  they’re intended to? I think so! See if you can pull that off. As a hint,  the server will need to be altered to return HTML instead of plain text   should be a one- or two-line change , and then the client will need  to display it  you might try just inserting the content into a  , or  perhaps an  , but either will require you to make additional  changes to MessageView.tsx .  280   Chapter 9    Delivering the gooDs: MailBag, the Client     Allow the user to upload pictures for their contacts. There are several   approaches, but you might consider using a plain old HTML form  with a   element, but then you’ll need to consider how to alter  the server to accept it. Then, store the image in a temporary location  and make the client fetch it to display it. Then figure out how to store  it in NeDB when they save it  hint: Base64-encoded is probably a  good answer there . Note that this most likely would not be part of  the RESTful API of the server, so you’ll need to figure out how to make  this coexist with the existing service endpoints.   Summary In this chapter, we completed the MailBag app, building the client side of it. In the  process, you learned about things like conditional rendering with React, the Material-  UI component library, a bit about AJAX and the Axios library for doing it, and CSS Grid.  The result is a complete application, MailBag, that, while pretty basic, does the job as a  webmail client pretty well.  One project down, just one to go! And the next one is going to be something quite a   bit different: a game!  281   CHAPTER 10  Time for Fun: BattleJong,  the Server  In my professional capacity as an architect and team lead, I am sometimes asked by  junior developers what they can do to improve their skills. Should they watch YouTube  videos about various topics in software development? Are there good books they should  read? What about side projects?  My advice has always been the same: to get better at anything, software development  very much included, you’ve got actually to do the thing you want to get better at! Nothing  beats experience. So yes, side projects are the way to go.  However, not all experience is equal. With programming, there is one thing that I  genuinely believe improves developer skills more than any other type of side project,  and that’s games. Even if you’re a business developer like me, games are where it’s at.  Why is that? Simply put, games force us to confront many different software   development challenges: algorithms, data structures, optimization, smart design,  flexible architecture, and so on. That’s before you even think about the more obvious  things like visual design and graphics. They also, by their nature, are an exciting  challenge to face because they are, by their nature, meant to be fun! Shouldn’t the  process of making a game be fun too? Indeed, it is, even when being challenging – and it  will be challenging, and in ways you can’t predict!  So, in this chapter and the next, we’re going to take that philosophy to heart and   build ourselves a game using React, TypeScript, and Node, as well as a few other  things. To be sure, this isn’t going to be a AAA game title ala Halo or even something  as addicting as Minecraft. But it will afford you the chance to view what you’ve learned  through a different lens and use some different development muscles, all of which will  provide you some new perspectives – along with some new skills – with which to create  going forward.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_10  283   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server   What Are We Building? In all probability, you’ve played Mahjong before, but if not, Figure 10-1 shows you what it  looks like.  Figure 10-1.  A basic Mahjong Solitaire layout  To be more accurate, what’s depicted there is actually called Mahjong Solitaire. Plain  old Mahjong is a little different, though they both are played with tiles depicting various  Chinese symbols – perfectly logical given that the game was invented in China during  the Qing dynasty  1636–1911 . Mahjong is vaguely similar to Poker in that you are trying  to create “hands” using tiles you are given at the start plus the tiles on the board, and you  play with multiple people, usually four.  Mahjong Solitaire, on the other hand, is, as the name implies, played in solitude by   one person. The goal is to find matching tiles and remove them from the board. The trick  is that the board is three-dimensional: there are five layers of tiles in that screenshot,  and you can only match and remove pairs that are “free,” which means that there is no  tile above them and none to either the left or right of each. You continue until you either  remove all the tiles, which is considered a win, or you have no more legal moves left,  which is regarded as a “dead-ended” board.  Now, our little game here, BattleJong, is going to be a bit different. First, we’ll do away  with the Chinese symbols and go with something… different. We’ll get to that in the next  chapter! Also, we’re going to make this a bit more social: as the word “Battle” in the name  implies, you’re going to play against another person.  284   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  The way it will work is that you’ll play simultaneously with someone else. You’ll get   up to ten points per matched tile pair. However, how long it takes you to find a match will  deduct from that number. You’ll always get at least one point per match, but you could  get anything from one to ten, depending on how long you take each time. In the end,  whoever has the highest score wins.  It’s not a complicated game mechanic to be sure, and it’s not even original, as   versions of Mahjong like this were done as far back as the mid-1990s in the DOS days.  But, for our purposes here, it’s perfect: being not too complicated means it won’t be  overwhelming, and the need to play against someone introduces the need for some sort  of server. And it’s not just any server: we need it to be real time, and the server needs  to be able to send data to the client at any time. This makes for a challenge and, more  importantly, allows me to introduce some new things to the mix.   Basic Requirements Before we get to the code  which there is surprisingly little of, as you’ll see , let’s outline  the exact requirements, and let’s also note whether it’s  at least primarily  and client  concern, a server concern, or both:     Each player should see a board similar  but a bit different  from   Figure 10-1  client .     They should be able to click a tile, have it highlighted in some way,   and then click another  client .      If they match, the pair should be removed, and the server must be  told how many points resulted from the match. The server must then  update the other player with that information and keep track of the  cumulative score of both  both .     Logic should be in place to ensure each player can only select “free”   tiles  client .     When a player launches the client, it must contact the server and  “register” the user. Once two players are registered, the game will  begin automatically  server .  285   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server     Whenever a player clears the board, or it is determined that there are   no more valid moves left, the server should be told  both .     Once both players register the board completed, the server will   determine who won based on score and inform both players  server .  As you can see, most of the work is really client side, which means it’ll be covered in  the next chapter. However, the server certainly does have some work to do, so let’s get to  work building it!   Setting Up the Project First things first: let’s create the project by creating a directory and then executing the  NPM commands that, by now, you probably know by heart:  npm init  Just accept all defaults, as usual, to create an NPM Node project. Then  npm install typescript --save-dev npx tsc -init  That gets TypeScript all set up. Finally, to ensure we can develop without having to   constantly build and restart ourselves, let’s add nodemon to the mix:  npm install nodemon --save-dev  That gives us the basic setup we need for the server.  Note  You may be wondering why, in the two projects presented in this book, i  didn’t use Webpack on the server side. indeed, you can do so. however, my feeling  is that since server-side code by its nature isn’t being shipped down to a browser,  there’s less need for Webpack there. Bundling up your code efficiently matters  less when it’s just going to be sitting on a server. i’d rather keep the workflow  more uncomplicated and not introduce another tool to the toolchain when working  on that code, so i left Webpack out of the server-side mix for those reasons, not  because of any technical issues.  286   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server   Some tsconfig.json Changes At this point, you would have yourself a default tsconfig.json file for TypeScript configuration.  For the most part, the default configuration will suffice, but there are a few changes needed,  or at least desired. Here is the effective tsconfig.json used for this project:  {   "compilerOptions": {     "target": "es5",     "module": "commonjs",     "sourceMap": true,     "outDir": ". dist",     "strict": true,     "noImplicitAny": true,     "strictNullChecks": true,     "strictFunctionTypes": true,     "strictBindCallApply": true,     "strictPropertyInitialization": true,     "noImplicitThis": true,     "alwaysStrict": true,     "esModuleInterop": true,     "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true   },   "include": [ "src ** *" ] }  Most of this you’ve seen before in the previous project and examples, but what’s new   is the setting that is collectively under the heading of “Strict Type-Checking Options,” from  the “strict” property to the “alwaysStrict” property. These are concerned with helping us  write better TypeScript code by tightening the screws of the rules imposed on us a bit:      strict – This enables all strict type-checking options. That means  that it will enable noImplicitAny, noImplicitThis, alwaysStrict,  strictBindCallApply, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes,  and strictPropertyInitialization. You can override any of these  as you wish though, and explicitly enabling them is redundant, but  does no harm.  287   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server     noImplicitAny – This will cause tsc to raise an error any time it   detects that a variable as part of an expression or declaration was of  type any implicitly  in other words, if you don’t specify a type, even if  it’s any . This forces you to declare types more consistently.                  strictNullChecks – In strict null checking mode, the null and  undefined values are not in the domain of every type and are only  assignable to themselves and any  the one exception being that  undefined is also assignable to void .  strictFunctionTypes – With this enabled, function-type parameter  positions are checked contravariantly instead of bivariantly  both  contravariant and bivariant . This topic can get pretty complicated  and would take a lot of space to explain properly here, so I’m going  to refer you to some existing documentation to do the job for me:  http:  www.stephanboyer.com post 132 what-are-covariance- and-contravariance.  strictBindCallApply – Simply put, this enables stricter checks when  you use the bind  , call  , and apply   functions. Since these can  get you into trouble if you aren’t careful, having them checked more  robustly is a Very Good Thing!  strictPropertyInitialization – This ensures that non-undefined class  properties are initialized in the constructor. Note that this option  requires that strictNullChecks be enabled to take effect.     noImplicitThis – This will cause tsc to raise an error if it encounters   “this” expressions with an implied any type.     alwaysStrict – This causes tsc to parse your code in ES6 strict mode  and also to include the "use strict" directive at the top of output  JavaScript files to enable a stricter ES6 adherence policy at runtime.  As a rule, I suggest always enabling these checks. It will lead to writing better   TypeScript code in almost all situations. You could run into some cases where you need  to disable them for one reason or another, but I’d start with them enabled and only  disable if you really need to.  288   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server   Adding Node Modules Next, we need to add the Node modules that we’ll be using. For this project, there’s only  two:  npm install express --save npm install ws --save  Express you already know about, and the ws library is what we’ll use for client-server   communications. But I can’t get into that just yet because there’s a bit of precursor  explanation that has to happen. That’ll be coming in short order, but before that, we  need to complete the project setup.   Adding Types Finally, since we’re using TypeScript, we like to have types for as much of what we’re  using as possible. Fortunately, there are types available for everything this project uses:  npm install @types node --save-dev npm install @types express --save-dev npm install @types ws --save-dev  With those installed, we’re good to go for the server side of BattleJong.   Source File Rundown Believe it or not, but for this project, there is only a single source file to deal with, and it’s  not even all that large  under 150 lines of actual code! .  So let’s get right into it!   The Starting Point  the ONLY Point, in Fact! :   server.ts The server.ts file begins, not surprisingly, with a few imports:  import path from "path";  289   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  As you’ve seen before, the path library that Node itself provides is used to construct   directory paths on our server; in this case, it’ll be used to get a path to the static resources  that make up the client so that they can be loaded via HTTP. And, to make HTTP  available, we need Express:  import express, { Express } from "express";  Finally, we’ll need that mysterious ws library that you saw added earlier:  import WebSocket from "ws";  Ooh, WebSocket, that sounds interesting! You may have even heard the term before,   and now “ws” probably starts to make some sense! Let’s see what that’s all about now,  shall we?   A Quick Detour: WebSockets The World Wide Web was initially conceived as a place where it was the client’s  responsibility to request information from a server, and indeed that’s how most  interactions today still occur. Everything is initiated by the client requesting some  information, or requesting some operation be performed. But that eliminates a host of  interesting possibilities or at least makes them more difficult and nonoptimal since you  wind up having to use various clever hacks.  For example, if you have a machine that provides stock prices to a client to display  in a dashboard, the client must continuously request updated prices from the server.  This is what’s referred to as the “polling” approach. The downsides, primarily, are that it  requires constant new requests from the client to the server  read: lots of network traffic ,  and the prices will only be as fresh as the polling interval, which you typically don’t want  to make too frequent for fear of overloading the server. The prices, therefore, aren’t truly  real time, something that can be very bad if you’re an investor.  With the advent of AJAX techniques, developers started to investigate ways to have   bidirectional communication, in which the server could push new stock prices out to the  client. One such method is called “long polling.” Sometimes called Comet, long polling is  a technique by which the client opens a connection with a server, as usual. But then, the  server holds the request open. It never sends the HTTP response completion signal, so  the connection persists. Then, when the server has something to transmit to the client,  the connection is already established, and the information can be sent immediately to   290   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  the client. This trick is sometimes referred to as a “hanging-GET” or “pending-POST,”  depending on the HTTP method used to establish the connection.  This can be tricky to implement for many reasons, but probably the key one is   that the connection processing thread is held on the server. Given that it’s an HTTP  connection and HTTP servers have some limit on the number of such request processing  threads they can support, the overhead to keeping them alive for a long time is not at  all inconsequential. Before long, your server can be brought to its knees, even without  seemingly having all that many clients connected.  The WebSocket protocol was created to allow this sort of persistent connection without  all the problems of long polling or other approaches. WebSockets is an Internet Engineering  Task Force  IETF  standard that enables bidirectional communication between a client and  a server. It does this by a special handshake when a regular HTTP connection is established.  To do this, the client sends a request that looks something like this:  GET ws:  websocket.apress.com  HTTP 1.1 Origin: http:  apress.com Connection: Upgrade Host: websocket.apress.com Upgrade: websocket  First, notice the protocol in the GET URL: ws. This indicates a WebSocket   connection. Then, notice that Upgrade header value. That’s the magic bit. When the  server sees this, and assuming it supports WebSockets, it will respond with a reply such  as this:  HTTP 1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake Date: Mon, 21 Dec 2017 03:12:44 EDT Connection: Upgrade Upgrade: WebSocket  The server “agrees to the upgrade,” in WebSockets parlance. Once this handshake   completes, the HTTP request is torn down, but the underlying TCP IP connection it rode  in on, so to speak, remains. That’s the persistent connection with which the client and  server can communicate in real time, without having to reestablish a connection every  time. To be clear, there is still overhead the server must maintain, but because TCP IP  requires considerably fewer resources than does HTTP riding on top of it, more persistent  connections can be maintained with WebSockets than with any clever HTTP hack.  291   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  WebSockets also comes with a JavaScript API, supported by all current browsers,  that you can use to establish connections, and both send and receive messages  and  messages is what we call data that is transmitted over a WebSocket connection, in either  direction . We’ll get into that API in the next chapter when we build the client, but for  now, we need to think about how WebSockets is used on the server side.  There are several options available to us, but I’m going to use perhaps the simplest  and the one that mimics the browser API as closely as possible. That API is contained in  a library called, simply enough, ws. You can read about it here: https:  github.com  websockets ws. But, to give you the core concepts quickly and easily, here’s a complete  example of using it:  import WebSocket from "ws";  const wsServer = new WebSocket.Server { port : 8080 } ;  wsServer.on "connection",  socket: WebSocket  => {   socket.on "message", inMsg => {     socket.send inMsg ;   } ; } ;  Simply put, you begin – after importing the library, of course – by constructing a   WebSocket server and tell it what port to listen on. Since port 80 is normally for HTTP  traffic, I went with 8080, so that it’s similar, but different.  The next part is vital: you must define what happens when messages are received  from the client  I suppose you don’t have to do this, but then not much is ever going  to happen in your application! . To do this, you have to first listen for the “connection”  event, which you do by calling the on   method of the WebSocket.Server instance,  as shown. Several events occur  message, close, error, headers, and listening, in  addition to connection , but connection is the most important one because it’s the  first time you have reference to the WebSocket object that will be associated with this  client going forward. Each connected client will have its own WebSocket instance, so you  need to hook up a “message” event handler function to that WebSocket. It’s important  to understand that you’re hooking it up to each individual WebSocket that’s created  by a client connecting, not to the WebSocket.Server. This is a common mistake, so be  careful!  292   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  From that point on, any messages that are sent from the client  however that   happens – it doesn’t matter right now!  will be handled by this function. In this case, all  it does is echoes the message back to the client, and here you can see how information  is sent from the server to the client: the send   method of the WebSocket instance for  that client. Note that any code that has a reference to this WebSocket can send messages  to the client, not just code inside the message event handler. For example, as long as  you keep a reference to the WebSocket in global scope, you could have some code in a  timeout   firing every ten seconds to send a message to the client.  That, basically, is how the ws library is used on the server side, minus one or two   other things that we’ll get to as we look at the code. WebSockets, in general, isn’t a  complicated thing from a developer standpoint, and you’ll see that’s true on the client  side as well in the next chapter.   Back to the Code! Okay, now that we know about WebSockets, we can get to examining the rest of the  code in server.ts. Ironically, after the imports, the first thing we encounter is not  WebSockets-related at all:  const players: any = { };  When a player connects to the server, they will be added to this object. Each property   in this object will be a player, and each property will be an object in the form:  { score: number, stillPlaying: boolean }  The score is, obviously, the player’s current score. The stillPlaying property will  be true to start and will remain true until the client signals that the player has either  cleared the board, or they have no more valid moves available, at which point it will flip  to false. The two objects in this players object are keyed by PID, or Player ID.  This object and its children, in essence, represent the “game state” at any given   moment in time, at least as far as the server is concerned.  293    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  Chapter 10   Serving the Client: The Express Server Our client app, which we’ll build in the next chapter, needs to be served by the server so  a player can load it in their browser. To provide this functionality, we’ll use the Express  library:  const app: Express = express  ; app.use " ", express.static path.join __dirname, ".. .. client dist"   ; app.listen 80,    => {   console.log "BattleJong Express server ready" ; } ;  That should look familiar to you because it is essentially the same code you saw in   the MailBag app. For BattleJong, though, we’re not defining a RESTful interface, so all we  need is the static middleware to serve the contents of the client dist directory.  At this point, we have an HTTP server listening on port 80. Next, we need to set up   another server, this one for WebSocket connections  yes, you absolutely can create  multiple servers from a single Node source file! .   Handling Messages: The WebSocket Server and Overall  Game Design Before we get into the code, let’s talk about the overall flow of events in the game from  the server’s perspective. There is a well-defined sequence of events – and corresponding  messages – that occurs during the game from start to finish. Figure 10-2 shows a  flowchart of that sequence.  294   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  Figure 10-2.  The overall sequence flow of events that makes BattleJong work  When the client is initially loaded, it connects to the server via WebSockets. Although   there is nothing our code has to do at that point as far as WebSockets is concerned,  the code sends a “connected” message to the client. As part of this message, the PID is  sent. All subsequent messages from the client must include this as it’s how the server  identifies the correct player for various operations.  Once there are two players connected, the server sends the “start” message to both  players. This message includes a shuffled layout. We’ll get into all of that later. For now,  suffice to say it’s the arrangement of tiles that the client should display.  From that point on, the client will send one of two messages: “match” or “done”. The  match message is for when they match a tile pair. The server needs to know the PID and   295   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  how many points the player got, so those are part of the message. This message can be  sent multiple times during the course of gameplay.  Once the player either clears the board or there are no more valid moves left, the   “done” message is sent. All the server needs to know is the PID in that case  because it  doesn’t care whether the board was cleared or dead-ended , so that’s all that’s sent. Once the server sees that both players have sent the done message, then it looks  at the scores and sends to both players the PID of the winning player. The client will  determine what to do based on that  which will be covered in the next chapter, but in  short, either a “you won” or a “you lost” message will be shown .  Now that you understand the overall flow, let’s look at the code that makes it work, at   least on the server side of the fence. We begin by constructing a WebSocket.Server:  const wsServer = new WebSocket.Server { port : 8080 }, function   {   console.log "BattleJong WebSocket server ready" ; } ; wsServer.on "connection",  socket: WebSocket  => {   ...Interesting Stuff Here... } ;  It’s even simpler than Express: instantiate WebSocket.Server, courtesy of the   ws library, and tell it what port to listen on. That’s the bare minimum we need to do.  Optionally, you can supply a callback function to execute once the server is ready, and  here I use it to display a log message.  Once that’s done, the key thing we must do is handle that “connection” event, as   previously discussed. You’ll recall that inside of it is where you hook up a handler for the  “message” event, and that’s exactly what the “Interesting stuff here” is  I just felt it would  be more intuitive to see this code separate from the code it’s contained in :  socket.on "message",  inMsg: string  => {   const msgParts: string[] = inMsg.toString  .split "_" ;   const message: string = msgParts[0];   const pid: string = msgParts[1];   switch  message  {     ...More Interesting Stuff Here...   } } ;  296   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  Every message that comes from the client, or that is sent from the server, will be  in the form “ _ _*” where   is the message being received or  sent,   is a unique ID associated with each player  more on this shortly , and ∗ is  additional data  not needed by all messages .  I’ll describe each of the messages in turn next and show the code associated with   each.   Message: “match”  Okay, so the game is in motion, and the players are matching tiles. Each tile they do so,  the server must be told about it with a message in the form “match_ _ ”.   The code that handles this message is the first case of our switch  message  statement:  case "match":   players[pid].score += parseInt msgParts[2] ;   wsServer.clients.forEach      function each inClient: WebSocket  {       inClient.send `update_${pid}_${players[pid].score}` ;     }    ; break;  The score that the client sends is added to the player’s current score by adding it  to the score property of the object corresponding to this player in the players object   remember that this object’s properties are keyed by PID . Now, the client that sent this  message knows its score, of course, but the other player needs to be told about it. To keep  things simple, we’re going to broadcast, so to speak, the score to both players and let  them act appropriately.  To do so, we must iterate over the connection of connected clients. Note here  that this is a property of the WebSocket.Server instance, not the particular client’s  WebSocket that initiated this message, like most of this code has been using. It makes  sense: the WebSocket server itself would be the thing that knows about all connected  clients, not an individual client’s WebSocket. For each client, the iteration provides us  the WebSocket for that client, so we can call send   on each to send a message in the  form “update_ _ ”. The client will take that information and update its  display accordingly  as you’ll see in the next chapter, the score of both players is updated  in real time on each player’s screen .  297   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server   Message: “done”  When either a player clears the board or the board has no more valid moves left  “dead-  ended” , the done message is sent, in the form “done_ ”:  case "done":   players[pid].stillPlaying = false;   let playersDone: number = 0;   for  const player in players  {     if  players.hasOwnProperty player   {       if  !players[player].stillPlaying  {         playersDone++;       }     }   }   if  playersDone === 2  {     let winningPID: string;     const pids: string[] = Object.keys players ;     if  players[pids[0]].score > players[pids[1]].score  {       winningPID = pids[0];     } else {       winningPID = pids[1];     }     wsServer.clients.forEach        function each inClient: WebSocket  {         inClient.send `gameOver_${winningPID}` ;       }      ;   } break;  There’s a bit more work here that needs to happen, but not all that much. First, the   player that sent this message is marked as done by changing the stillPlaying property  of the object associated with it in the players collection to false. Next, we need to see if  both players are done. Since players is an object and not an array, we can’t just access  players[0] and players[1] to do this check. Instead, we have to iterate the properties  of the object. That’s where the for loop comes in. But we have to be careful to only look   298   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  at properties defined on the object itself, not any that may come from its prototype,  which is why we do players.hasOwnProperty player . After that, it’s a simple matter of  incrementing playersDone if stillPlaying is false for each player.  If we finish that loop and playersDone is 2, then the game has ended. In this case, it’s   time to determine a winner! That’s easy enough: we get an array of keys in the players  object and then compare the scores of both, pulling the PID of the winning player out.  Finally, the “gameOver_ ” message is broadcast to both players, and our  work here is done!  Note  eagle-eyed readers will notice that the iteration in the check of  stillPlaying could have been done the same way as the score comparison was  made, thus avoiding the iteration  or vice versa . this is true, and i just did it two  different ways to give you some different approaches to consider for accomplishing  these things. if i were writing this code “for real,” so to speak, i’d have done it with  Object.keys both times i think, but as they say on the interwebs: Ymmv  Your  mileage may vary .   Finishing Up the WebSocket Server At this point, our WebSocket server is set up to handle the two messages the client can  send, but there’s still a little bit left to be done inside the callback function passed to the  wsServer.on "connection"  statement  remember that what we’ve been looking at is  all contained in that! .  First, we have to generate the PID I’ve been talking about:  const pid: string = `pid${new Date  .getTime  }`;  Nothing fancy required here; we just use the current time. Next, we need to add an   object to the players object to represent this player:  players[pid] = { score : 0, stillPlaying : true };  Now, the server is ready to go. So, the next step is to inform the user of their PID,   which is done by sending a “connected_ ” message:  socket.send `connected_${pid}` ;  299   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  Finally, if we now have two players ready to go, then we can start the game! To do so,   a "start_ " message is sent:  if  Object.keys players .length === 2  {   const shuffledLayout: number[][][] = shuffle  ;   wsServer.clients.forEach      function each inClient: WebSocket  {       inClient.send        `start_${JSON.stringify shuffledLayout }`        ;     }    ; }  Naturally, we need to broadcast this message, as you’ve seen before. But what gets   sent to both players is a shuffled layout, meaning the random distribution of tiles on the  board. That random layout is produced by a call to the shuffle   function, and that’s  our next  and last, as it happens  stop on the BattleJong server train!   Of Tiles and Board Layouts I’ve mentioned the board layout a few times, but what does that really mean in terms of  code? Well, recall earlier that I described a Mahjong Solitaire layout as being multiple  levels of stacked tiles. If you want to model that in code, there’s probably more than  one way, but perhaps the most natural is a multidimensional array. Each primary  dimension of the array is one of five layers of tiles, starting with the bottom-most layer.  The secondary dimension will then represent each row. The tertiary dimension will then  represent a column, or a specific tile, in the row.  In other words, what we’re dealing with is simply five grids laid on top of one   another. In each position of each layer, there either can be a tile or not. And, in the case  of Mahjong, and BattleJong by extension, a tile can be one of 42 types.  But that’s jumping ahead just a bit. We don’t need to worry about types yet; we just  need to worry about which positions have tiles and which don’t. For that, we have the  layout construct, which is that multidimensional array I described:  300   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  const layout: number[][][] = [   [     [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ],     [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ],     [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 ],   ],   [     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],     [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]   ],   ... Three more layers' worth of data ... ];  To save space, I’ve only shown the first two layers’ worth of data, but there are simply  three more arrays of arrays for those layers. Simply stated, where you see a zero, there is  no tile. Where you see a one, there is a tile.  As you look at this, if you can sort of mentally strip away the 0’s and just try to   visualize the pattern of the 1’s and you compare it to the Mahjong layout shown at the  start of this chapter, you should be able to begin to see how the overall layout is built up  from these layers  note that I altered the arrangement from the standard Mahjong layout  just a little, purely for aesthetic reasons – I like perfect symmetry! .  That provides us the basic layout of the tiles, but it doesn’t tell us which tiles  which 1’s    are which type of tile. For that, we need the shuffle   function.  301   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server   Shuffling the Board  The goal of the shuffle   function is to take that underlying layout array of arrays  of  arrays!  and change all the 1’s to other values that correspond to tile types. I mentioned  earlier that there are 42 tile types, which is the standard number for Mahjong, so I stuck  with that. When we get to the client code, you’re going to find that there are 42 image  files named 101.png, 102.png, 103.png, and so on. Therefore, our goal here is to change  each 1 in layout to 101, 102, 103, and so on.  Let’s see how that’s done:  function shuffle  : number[][][] {    const cl: number[][][] = layout.slice 0 ;    let numWildcards: number = 0;    const numTileTypes: number = 42;   for  let l: number = 0; l < cl.length; l++  {     const layer: number[][] = cl[l];     for  let r: number = 0; r < layer.length; r++  {       const row: number[] = layer[r];       for  let c: number = 0; c < row.length; c++  {         const tileVal: number = row[c];         if  tileVal === 1  {           row[c] =  Math.floor Math.random   * numTileTypes   + 101;           if  row[c] === 101 && numWildcards === 3  {             row[c] = 102;           } else {             numWildcards += numWildcards;           }         }       }     }   }    return cl;  }  302   Chapter 10    time for fun: BattleJong, the Server  Before we get into this, I want to point out that this uses the American-style shuffle,   which is a purely random shuffle and can lead to an unsolvable arrangement. In our  case, that’s okay because since both players will be using the same layout, it doesn’t so  much matter that there’s no path to clearing the board, what matters is that they’re on an  even playing field regardless.  We begin by cloning the layout array. We don’t want to alter it in case we want to   start a new game, so a clone it is. Next, we’re going to allow our layout to have up to four  wildcard tiles. Wildcard tiles are tiles that can match any other tile type. Some Mahjong  variants have wildcards, and some don’t. I decided to include them, but they will be  random like the tiles, which means not all shuffles will produce a layout with wildcards.  But, because I don’t want there to be more than four, we’re going to need to keep track of  how many are randomly selected, if any.  So, the real work is done by iterating over each layer in the layout, then each row in a  layer, and finally, each tile  or column  in the row. Every time we hit a 1, it’s time to select  a tile randomly! We choose a random number from 0 to 41  numTileTypes is 42, which  gives us our upper bounds, non-inclusive, to the random selection  and then add 101 to  it to get a value that will correspond to one of our tile images on the client.  Now, if the value chosen is 101, that’s going to be the value for a wildcard. In that  case, we need to see how many wildcards have already been selected. If we’ve already  filled our quota of wildcards, then the value is bumped to 102 so that it’s no longer a  wildcard.  Finally, the non-randomized layout is returned and will then be sent to the client as   At this point, we’ve got ourselves a BattleJong server in search of a client to make it a   you saw earlier.  complete game!   Suggested Exercises It’s a bit tough to suggest exercises for this chapter because most of what I might  recommend would require changes on the client side as well.

Summary In this chapter, we built the not especially complicated server side of the BattleJong  equation. In the process, you learned about WebSockets and started to exercise your  game programming skills a bit.  In the next chapter, we’ll tackle the client side of the game and see how to hook it   up to the server to complete the puzzle and have ourselves a fully playable two-person  game.  304   CHAPTER 11  Time for Fun: BattleJong,  the Client  In the last chapter, we began building BattleJong, our little “social” Mahjong game.  Now, it’s time to dive in and create the client side, which is where most of the game  code is found.  Let’s begin by talking about what we’re building, where you can finally see what this   thing is going to look like!   What Are We Building? In the previous chapter, you saw what a typical Mahjong game looks like. BattleJong will  look substantially the same, but because I’m such a huge sci-fi nerd, I’m going to give it a  sci-fi bend, as you can see in Figure 11-1.    Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_11  305   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Figure 11-1.  An ancient Chinese game meets the future!  The layout is very simple here: your playboard on the left and a “control” area  in the upper right. In the control area will be shown your current score and your  opponent’s current score, along with messages below that will change according to  what state the game is in. You can see too that I’ve clicked the topmost tile to show it in  its highlighted state.  That, really, is all there is to the client side of BattleJong visually.   Basic Requirements Given the aforementioned simplicity, the requirements are all straightforward:     Upon loading the client in the browser via accessing the server’s URL,   if you’re the first player, you’ll be in a “waiting” state until another  player connects to the server.     Once the other player connects, or if you were the second player to  connect, the game will begin automatically, the board appearing on  the left.  306   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client     You play according to the basic rules of Mahjong Solitaire, as   discussed in the previous section until the board is cleared or dead-  ended. Once either happens, you will be in a waiting state again until  your opponent also finishes.     Once both players finish, the winner is shown in the control area.     Clicking a tile, assuming it’s free, highlights it.  There’s not much more to it than that!   Setting Up the Project Setting up this project is simple enough; most of it you’ve seen and done before:  npm init  use all defaults  npm install --save-dev typescript npx tsc -init npm install webpack --save-dev npm install webpack-cli --save-dev npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev npm install awesome-typescript-loader --save-dev npm install style-loader --save-dev npm install css-loader --save-dev npm install html-loader --save-dev npm install url-loader --save-dev  Naturally, you can  and probably should, unless you want to do it all from scratch    download the source code bundle for this book and execute npm install to get all the  dependencies installed  the initialization steps will have already been done for you .  The one new element here is the url-loader dependency, which is a Webpack loader.   Let’s talk about that after we talk about the TypeScript config file.  307    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client Chapter 11   Some tsconfig.json Changes The effective TypeScript config file for the client side of this project is  {   "compilerOptions": {     "target": "es5",     "module": "commonjs",     "lib": [ "es2015", "es2017", "dom" ],     "jsx": "react",     "sourceMap": true,     "outDir": ". dist",     "strict": true,     "noImplicitAny": true,     "strictNullChecks": true,     "strictFunctionTypes": true,     "strictBindCallApply": true,     "strictPropertyInitialization": true,     "noImplicitThis": false,     "alwaysStrict": true,     "noUnusedParameters": true,     "noImplicitReturns": true,     "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,     "baseUrl": ". ",     "esModuleInterop": true,     "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true   },   "paths" : { "components *" : [ "src components *" ] } }  If you compare this to the version for the server, you’ll find them to be nearly   identical, and most of the differences are related to one being client-side code and one  being server-side code.  For example, the lib element here is needed to ensure we have included the library   code associated with ES2015, ES2017, and the browser DOM, which, of course, isn’t  required on the server. The jsx element is needed on the client too given we’re building  the app with React, but not the server. The baseURL option is necessary for the client in   308   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  order for dependencies to be resolvable at runtime, and again, the server doesn’t need  that. Finally, in this case, we have a paths element to tell Webpack where our React  component source files are, but on the server side, we just needed the include element  to point it at the src directory.  One thing I skipped there, a difference, is the noImplicitThis option. As you can  see, strict is set to true, which means that all the strict checks are enabled  and as I  mentioned in the previous chapter, it’s redundant, though not an error, to then have each  explicitly enabled . However, this option causes lots of compiler errors in socketComm. ts and state.ts to be reported, and I didn’t see a clean way to have it enabled while  avoiding the errors. So, this is one of those cases I mentioned in the previous chapter  where disabling the option that otherwise is good to enable is needed. This also shows  that you definitely can enable and disable individual checks, and the setting overrides  the strict setting. There’s no conflict there, which is nice since it provides you granular  control over these checks.   Some webpack.config.js Changes Now, let’s jump back to Webpack and see its config file:  const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require "html-webpack-plugin" ; module.exports = {   entry : ". src code main.tsx",   resolve : {     extensions : [ ".ts", ".tsx", ".js" ]   },   module : {     rules : [       {         test:  \.png$ ,         use : { loader : "url-loader",           options : { limit : 65536, esModule : false, }         }       },  309   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client        {         test :  \.html$ ,         use : { loader : "html-loader" }       },       {         test :  \.css$ ,         use : [ "style-loader", "css-loader"]       },       {         test :  \.tsx?$ ,         loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader'       }     ]  index.html" }     ],   performance : { hints : false },   watch : true,   devtool : "source-map" };    },   plugins : [      new HtmlWebPackPlugin { template : ". src index.html", filename : ".   Save for one thing, it’s the same as what you saw for MailBag, but the one thing is  very interesting and that’s the url-loader, the dependency you saw imported as part of  the project setup.  The question we must answer here is: how do we include images in a project that   Webpack will package for us? It turns out there are several answers, but the one I’m  using is the url-loader. What this does for us is it encodes any images it finds  note the  test for the loader matching .png  in Base64 and then embeds it into the final bundle.  This is nice because it overall generally leads to better performance in terms of load  time because the browser doesn’t need to open new connections to the server to fetch  images. They’re already there in what was initially downloaded!  The module allows us to set a size limit too. Here, for any image larger than 64k,   Webpack will use the file-loader, which is what it uses by default. This would load the  images in the usual way a browser usually would.  310   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The esModule config option is essential here because, by default, this loader will   generate JS modules that use the ES module syntax. In order to be able to import  the images in our code files and treat them like any other code module – which is  exactly what we want to do and will be doing later – we need to set this option to true.  Otherwise, you will run into compilation problems with TypeScript.   Adding Libraries As far as libraries go, there are no new ones needed for this project, just React, naturally,  and normalize.css:  npm install normalize.css --save npm install react --save npm install react-dom --save  That didn’t take long, did it?   Adding Types As with libraries, there are only a few TypeScript types needed:  npm install @types react --save-dev npm install @types react-dom --save-dev  That gets us all the TypeScript goodness we can have for this project, so now we can   dive into what the files are that make up the project.   Source File Rundown Although not as minimal as the server’s single source file, the client doesn’t have that  many files to consider either:          src index.html – Our main entry point  src css main.css – A single stylesheet  311   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client                              src code d.ts – A file we’ll get into later for something for TypeScript  that you haven’t seen yet  src code main.tsx – Our main code entry point  src code socketComm.ts – Contains the code that communicates  with the server via WebSockets  src code state.ts – A state object, just like in MailBag  and similarly,  most of the interesting code is here   src code components BaseLayout.tsx – Also as with MailBag, a  base React component to sit at the top of our component tree  src code components ControlArea.tsx – A component for the  control area in the upper right  src code components PlayerBoard.tsx – The primary component  of the app in essence, where the gameboard is  There is also an img directory that contains 42 files named tile101.png,   tile102.png, and so on. There are, obviously enough, the 42 tile images that are  used on the board.   The Starting Point: index.html As with MailBag, it all starts with a simple HTML document, index.html:                     BattleJong              312  And, also as with MailBag, there isn’t much to see here because React will be   constructing the UI, and for that, we need some code, and that leads us to…   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client   The REAL Starting Point: main.tsx We begin in the main.tsx file, with a few imports:  import "normalize.css"; import ".. css main.css";  As with MailBag, we want a clean slate as far as styles go, so normalize.css is   brought in. Then, our application-specific stylesheet, main.css, is likewise imported.  There aren’t many style definitions in that file, but I’ll introduce pieces of it as we  encounter the style classes throughout the rest of the code.  After that, React is imported:  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom";  Finally, the BaseLayout component is as well. This will be the component at the top   of the component hierarchy that will contain state for all the child components:  import BaseLayout from ". components BaseLayout";  And, once that’s all imported, it’s time to render us an interface:  ReactDOM.render  , document.body ;  At this point in app execution, you’d have the basic screen up, though the playboard   is initially hidden  unless you are the second player to connect to the server , so it’s  mostly an empty screen. Still, it’s a start!  Now, let’s see what that BaseLayout component has in store for us.   The Basic Layout: BaseLayout.tsx The BaseLayout component starts with some React imports, as you’d reasonably expect  for a React component:  import React, { Component } from "react";  313   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Then, we have three application imports, one for the ControlArea component, one   for the PlayerBoard component, and one for our state object code:  import ControlArea from ". ControlArea"; import PlayerBoard from ". PlayerBoard"; import { createState } from ".. state";  After that, it’s time to build a component. This is how it starts:  class BaseLayout extends Component {    state = createState this ;  I again use the same pattern as in MailBag, where state is housed in the topmost  object, and the state object is constructed via a call to createState  , which is code  you’ll see later.  Next, we run into the render   method:  render   {   return                                                                     ; }  .appContainer {   position : absolute;   height : 750px;   left : 50%;   top : 50%;  314  Everything is contained with a single  , and that   has the appContainer   style class from main.css applied, which is as follows:   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client    transform : translate -50%, -50% ;   border : 2px solid 0000ff;   border-radius : 10px 10px 10px 10px;   -moz-border-radius : 10px 10px 10px 10px;   -webkit-border-radius : 10px 10px 10px 10px;   display : grid;   grid-template-columns : 960px 300px;   -webkit-box-shadow : 0 0 25px 0 rgba 255, 200, 0, 0.75 ;   -moz-box-shadow : 0 0 25px 0 rgba 255, 200, 0, 0.75 ;   box-shadow : 0 0 25px 0 rgba 255, 200, 0, 0.75 ; }  The entire element is to be centered both horizontally and vertically, which is   where the left and top values come into play. But that only works if position is set to  absolute and if the element has a defined height, so those are both done. Then, one  final piece of the centering puzzle is needed: the translate transformation. This shifts the  topmost   halfway left and up, which, all together, gets the centering I want.  I also apply a blue border and round the corners to make it look nice and apply a   drop shadow around the whole thing  extending in all four directions  so that it has  something of a glowing yellow look to it. Finally, display is set to grid, and two columns  are defined, the first for the gameboard and the second for the control area.  Speaking of the gameboard, that’s the next element in the hierarchy, the one with the   playerBoard style class applied, and that class is  As you know from the previous project, that puts this   into the first column.   Then, into this   goes a PlayerBoard component, passing it the state object.  Obviously, we’ll be looking at that shortly.  The second child   is the second column and is where the control area goes. It   has the following style applied:  .playerBoard {   grid-column : 1   2; }  .controlArea {   height : 240px;   margin : 10px;   padding : 10px;  315   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client    grid-column : 2   3;   border : 1px solid 000000;   border-radius : 10px 10px 10px 10px;   -moz-border-radius : 10px 10px 10px 10px;   -webkit-border-radius : 10px 10px 10px 10px; }  In this case, I don’t want the control area to take up the entire column, so I define  a height. I also add some margin and padding to keep its contents from bumping up  against the border  and to give some separation between the outer border and the  control area’s border . Of course, I have to tell the grid layout where this element goes  in the grid, so that’s done. Finally, the control area is given a border with some rounded  corners, again just for aesthetics.  The control area houses the aptly named ControlArea component, and why not   jump right into that now?   Feedback and Status: ControlArea.tsx The ControlArea component is the area in the upper right-hand corner where the scores  are displayed, as well as messages at various points in the lifecycle of the game. It’s not at  all complex, but it does introduce a new React concept:  const ControlArea =  { state }: any  =>         What’s that React.Fragment about? Well, as you’ll recall, the render   method   must always return a single component. That component can, of course, have as many  children as you like, but ultimately, it’s a single top-level component being returned.  But what happens when what you really need to return is a list of components? You’re  going to have to find some component to be its parent. While that’s often easy  and there  are frequently many choices, with   being very common , wouldn’t it be nice if you  could return a list of components without adding extra nodes to the DOM? Because  remember, that’s what’s going to happen when you return a component: HTML will be  produced and added to the DOM. And sometimes, it won’t be so simple: remember that  each component you add to the hierarchy has a render   method, and all of them must  return a single component.  316   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  To illustrate this, imagine you were trying to render a plain old HTML table, and you  create a Table component along with a TableHeader component for the header that you  nested under your Table component. HTML tables usually have multiple headers for the  columns, so the TableHeader component might be something like  const TableHeader =    =>      Column 1     Column 2     Column 3   ;  Hopefully you see the problem: you’ll hit a compiler warning  or error, depending on   settings  because you’re trying to return multiple items from render    remember that  render   is implicit when using the functional approach to components like this . If you  try to wrap all the   elements in a  , that would solve the compiler issue, but it  will result in invalid HTML because   isn’t valid at that point in a table. So, that’s not  a good solution.  That’s where React.Fragment comes in. It acts as a parent component, but unlike      and most other components , it doesn’t output any HTML itself. It’s strictly a  container for children. In this case, I have a list of   elements, as well as some    elements that I want to return, and essentially, it’s just a list of such elements, all at the  same level in the hierarchy. Using React.Fragment here makes a lot of sense.   Scores Here's the first batch of children that go inside the React.Fragment:      Your score:   {state.scores.player}      Opponent score:   {state.scores.opponent}         317   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The two scores use a total of four elements, two for each label and two for each actual   score. The labels are floated left and given a specific width so that the   elements  that follow them, where the scores are, will be lined up nicely. The scores come from  state, of course, and specifically the scores property. But we’ll get to that later.   Game State Messages While the scores are always present, the messages that can appear below them are not,  and they change. So, we’re going to use some conditional rendering again as you saw in  MailBag, and the first message that may be shown is what you see when you’re waiting  for an opponent to join:  { state.gameState === "awaitingOpponent" &&   <div style={{ color:"ff0000", fontWeight:"bold",     textAlign:"center" }}>Waiting for opponent to join  }  As I’m sure you’ve surmised, the gameState property of the state object tells us what  state the game is in. We can be waiting for an opponent, actually playing, waiting for the  game to end because our board has dead-ended or has been cleared, and the game can  be over. The first state is when we’re waiting for an opponent, so appropriate verbiage is  shown, as you can see.  When the board is dead-ended, we again show a suitable message:  { state.gameState === "deadEnd" &&   <div style={{ color:"ff0000", fontWeight:"bold",     textAlign:"center" }}>     You have no moves left.            Waiting for opponent to finish.     }  Similarly, when the board has been cleared, we congratulate the player, because   that’s super cool of them:  { state.gameState === "cleared" &&   <div style={{ color:"ff0000", fontWeight:"bold",  318   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client      textAlign:"center" }}>     Congratulations!            You've cleared the board!  Waiting for opponent     to finish.     }  Finally, when the game is over, we tell them that, along with who the winner was, as   determined by the server:  { state.gameState === "gameOver" &&   <div style={{ color:"ff0000", fontWeight:"bold",     textAlign:"center" }}>     The game is over.            { state.gameOutcome }     }  Like I said, this isn’t a tough component, not much in it. But the next one is where   most of the action is, naturally enough, since it’s where the game is played!   Where the Action Is: PlayerBoard.tsx The PlayerBoard component is what you see on the left-hand side of the screen and is  where the player plays the game. It begins with some imports, as always:  import React, { CSSProperties, ReactElement } from "react";  Oh, but look, we have two new ones: CSSProperties and ReactElement. Keep those   in mind, as we’ll see them in use soon, and I’ll explain what they’re all about then.  Before that, though, we have a series of imports, 42 of them to be precise, and that   number should ring a bell:  import tile101 from ".. .. img tile101.png"; import tile102 from ".. .. img tile102.png"; ...40 more...  319   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Yes indeed, one for each image! As you’ll recall, Webpack will include our images  as Base64-encoded strings in the final bundle and will also wrap them up in a module  definition. That’s why we can import them here. It may seem weird to import images –  and I’d agree it is! – but essentially, at this point, they are code, and we’ll be using them  as such. But, before we can, we must solve for one small problem, and it’s where the d.ts  file comes into play.   A Quick Detour: Custom-Type Definitions Any time you see a d.ts file – and you’ll see them frequently with TypeScript – it means  that the developer has provided TypeScript some additional type information about an  API written in JavaScript. This allows TypeScript to do its thing, ensuring that types are  correctly used and everything else it provides. This contrasts with the other alternative:  rewriting the API in TypeScript. Imagine if you want to use jQuery, but there isn’t a  TypeScript version available. As long as you have a declaration file for it, you can still use  it in TypeScript, complete with all the checking  and IntelliSense inside an IDE  that it  provides.  Note  frequently, you’ll see index.d.ts instead of d.ts. anything *.d.ts is  a typeScript declaration file, the name is more convention than anything else, so  some variation is normal.  This all comes into play with the image imports. If you don’t have this d.ts file,   you’ll find that tsc flags each of those imports as an error saying that the module can’t  be found. You can technically still get them to import using require   notation, but it’s  something of an eyesore to use import everywhere but require   just for the images, so  better to make it work the ideal way I figure. The way to solve this is to declare a module  for TypeScript, which is what we find in the d.ts file:  declare module "*.png" {  const value: any;  export = value; }  320  Now, TypeScript will know that the image files, any module name ending in .png in   fact, are a valid module. The code will compile, and everything will work as expected.   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Remember definitelytyped.org? If you go there and pull up a random module in   the search engine, when you get to the NPM page for the module, you should see a link  somewhere to where the files were exported from. Click that link, and you should see  some sort of *.d.ts file in the list of files. Doing that, you can view the type information  provided for any JavaScript module you want to use.   Back to the Code! Getting back to the PlayerBoard component’s code, we begin by functionally  constructing the component:  const PlayerBoard =  { state }: any  => {  Note here that I need to specify the type of any for the state object because otherwise,  I’ll get a compiler warning due to the noImplicitAny check being turned on  this wasn’t  the case in MailBag .  Next, we have some variables that define metadata about the tiles:  const tileWidth: number = 72; const tileHeight: number = 88; const tileShadowWidth: number = 11; const tileShadowHeight: number = 11;  To lay the tiles out properly on the screen, we need to know their width and height.  But we also need to know the width and height of the drop shadow on each because the  board will be constructed by overlapping these shadows.  Next, we have two other variables that express metadata:  const xAdjust: number = 10; const yAdjust: number = 36;  These are used to push the arrangement of tiles down and right a little bit so that the  tiles are centered within the left-hand column and not touching up against the border on  the top and left.  After that, we have an array that will contain components, one per tile, when we   render them later:  const tiles: ReactElement[] = [ ];  321   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The problem here is in determining the type  which we must do since the   noImplicitAny check won’t allow us to either choose a type or explicitly use any, which  you usually should try and avoid wherever possible for maximum TypeScript goodness .  As you’ll see soon, we’re going to be rendering an   element for each tile. We’re  going to populate this tiles array with those elements. So, what’s the appropriate type?  The ReactElement class is the answer. Instances of this class are virtual DOM elements that represent an instance of a DOM   element  like an   , a React component, or a fragment. A ReactElement describes  what you literally see on the screen, whereas a component is a level above that: a single  component can be composed of numerous ReactElement instances even.  You can roughly think of ReactElement as a base class in an object-oriented   language in the sense that you can usually have a generic reference to a more specific  object through a variable typed as the base class. For example, in Java, a variable of type  Object can reference any other type of object because Object is the base class of all  other classes in Java. ReactElement isn’t precisely the same because it’s not an object-  oriented relationship, but you can effectively treat it like it is, which is exactly why the  type of the tiles array can be ReactElement  an array of them, to be more precise  and  we can later have   instances in it and TypeScript won’t complain about the typing.  Finally, we have two more variables:  let xOffset: number = 0; let yOffset: number = 0;  These aren’t metadata, though; these are used throughout the render process to   determine where to place tiles.   The Render Process The render process is what’s next, and it begins thusly:  for  let l: number = 0; l < state.layout.length; l++  {   xOffset = xOffset + tileShadowWidth;   yOffset = yOffset - tileShadowHeight;   const layer: number[][] = state.layout[l];  322   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The overall flow here is that we’re going to iterate over the layers in the layout  which   can be found in the state object that we’ll look at later, but for now understand that  it’s simply the layout passed from the server in the same form that you saw in the last  chapter . Then, for each layer, we’ll iterate the rows in it. Then, for each tile in the row,  we’ll render it. The xOffset and yOffset will result in the tiles of each layer being shifted  right and up a little bit, enough so that the tiles overlap the previously rendered ones,  and we get the correct appearance from the board.  Next, after pulling the layer data out of the layout, we iterate the rows in it:  for  let r: number = 0; r < layer.length; r++  {   const row: number[] = layer[r];   for  let c: number = row.length; c >= 0; c--  {     let tileVal: number = row[c];  For each row, we iterate the tiles in it, and for each we grab its value. With that, we do   some logic:  xOffset + xAdjust;  yOffset + yAdjust;  if  tileVal > 0  {    const xLoc: number =   c * tileWidth  -  c * tileShadowWidth   +       const yLoc: number =   r * tileHeight  -  r * tileShadowHeight   +   First, only a value great than zero is rendered because zero means there is no tile   in a given grid slot, and negative one would mean the file has been cleared. So, we  need to figure out where to place the tile. Every tile will be positioned absolutely, so we  need to figure out the x and y location  left and top in style terms . Since what we’re  really rendering is a grid, the math is straightforward. For xLoc, it’s the column number   variable c  multiplied by the width of the tile, which gives us a horizontal row of tiles.  Then, we have to account for the tile shadow since we want them to overlap, so we  subtract out the width of the shadow times the column again. Next, we need to account  for the 3D look of the grid. To do this, each layer shifts the tiles in it by a little bit up and  right. That’s where xOffset comes into play. Finally, with the location determined, we  need to ensure that the entire grid of tiles is pushed away from the upper-left border, so  xAdjust is added.  The vertical location yLoc is calculated in the same way but now using tile and   shadow height and the row number as a multiplier.  323   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Now, I said there that each tile would be positioned absolutely, and this is where that   CSSProperties import from earlier is used:  const style: CSSProperties = {   position : "absolute",   left : `${xLoc}px`,   top : `${yLoc}px` };  The issue being solved here is that when I render the   tags, they’re all going   to have a similar style definition, just being different in the xLoc and yLoc values. So, it  makes sense to have that be a common element, a common object, which is what it is  here. However, the value of the style attribute, as you’ll see soon, can’t just be a string,  or even a plain old JavaScript object. It must be a CSSProperties instance, so that’s  the type used here and why it had to be imported. But, the type aside, it really is just an  object, nothing special otherwise.  Next, we have to account for the possibility that the tile is highlighted because  it’s selected. This is implemented by applying a style class to it. We know it must be  highlighted if its value is greater than 1000, so:  let className: string = ""; if  tileVal > 1000  {   className = "highlightTile";   tileVal = tileVal - 1000; }  Of course, the values of our tiles are numbered 101–142, so in order to get the right   tile displayed, we need to subtract 1000 from tileVal.  Now, as for the highlightTile style class applied, that’s as follows:  .highlightTile {   -webkit-filter : drop-shadow 0px 0px 50px ff0000      contrast 150%  saturate 200% ;   filter : drop-shadow 0px 0px 10px ff0000      contrast 150%  saturate 200% ; }  324   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  I apply a red drop shadow to the element, but with no horizontal or vertical offset  and a big blue, which gives the effect of a glowing edge all around it. I also bump the  contrast and saturation up so that it stands out a bit more. It’s a simple way to implement  a highlight but rather effective.  The final piece of the puzzle is actually to render the tiles:  switch  tileVal  {   case 101 : tiles.push <img style={style} src={tile101}     className={className}     onClick={  =>state.tileClick l, r, c } alt=""  > ; break;   case 102 : tiles.push <img style={style} src={tile102}     className={className}     onClick={  =>state.tileClick l, r, c } alt=""  > ; break;   ...40 more... }  For each of the 42 tile types, we have a case in a switch. They’re all the same save   for the value of the src attribute. Here, you can see how the CSSProperties style  object is used and how the src points to one of the imported image modules  see, I  told you we’re using those like code! . Each also gets the className, which is blank  for all but the highlighted tile, if any. Finally, each tile gets an onClick handler that  calls the tileClick   method in the state object, passing it the layer, row, and column  number of the tile. We’ll look at that in the section about the state object. Oh, the alt  attribute also has to be defined to avoid a compiler warning  or at least an IDE warning  in my IDE of choice .  Once all the tiles have been pushed into the tiles array, we can finally return the   output of this  implicit  render   method:  return   { tiles }  ;  Once again, React.Fragment is used to be the one component returned, but now   it has a child that is the tiles array. React will dutifully recognize that we want all the  elements in the array to be children of the React.Fragment and we’re good to go.  325   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Note  the imports and the switch statement frankly bother me because having  42 of each would usually be seen as redundant coding, and i would agree!  however, i see no way to do like you can in Java and do a star import to get all  the images imported in one line, nor do i see a way dynamically name the tile in  the   tag. the type of src isn’t a string, so simple concatenation won’t do,  and i couldn’t see a way to reference it dynamically either  something like, maybe,  const s: any = tile[tileVal]; . perhaps you’re more clever than i am  and can figure something out, and i wouldn’t mind hearing about it if you did – you  can teach me something! – but sometimes there is no elegant solution  at least no  obvious one , so you just gotta do what you gotta do.   Talking to the Server: socketComm.ts Next, let’s look at the socketComm.ts source file, which contains the code that talks to the  server via WebSockets. It begins with a single import:  import React from "react";  As it happens, this import is only needed for TypeScript purposes – if this were plain   JavaScript, it wouldn’t be needed – and where it’s needed is the very next line:  export function createSocketComm    inParentComponent: React.Component   {  Much like the state object that you saw in MailBag  and like the state object you’ll  see next in this project , a function is necessary to return an object that will be used by  the rest of the code due to binding requirements. The argument passed in is a React. Component, so that’s why we need the import: to be able to specify the type of this  argument  contrast this with the argument to the createState   method in the MailBag  state object where it wasn’t typed, so this import wasn’t needed there .  Next, it’s time to connect up to the server:    const connection: WebSocket = new WebSocket "ws:  localhost:8080" ;  326   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The browser provides the WebSocket object  assuming a relatively newer version:   IE11+, Edge 18+, Firefox 11+, Chrome 78+, Safari 13+, Opera 64+ , and our app just needs  a single instance, pointed to the server and using the ws protocol prefix. You, of course,  can change this URL as appropriate, so long as the server is changed accordingly. This  line establishes communication with the server, assuming it’s listening.  Next, an event listener is hooked up to the WebSocket object to log a message when   the connection is opened:  connection.onopen =    => {   console.log "Connection opened to server" ; };  That’s all we need to do in this instance, so there’s not much to see. Also, handling   errors in some way is a good thing to do, so that event handler is hooked up next:  connection.onerror = error => {   console.log `WebSocket error: ${error}`  };  Since error recovery can be a whole topic on its own, I went the simple route and   just ensured that the error is logged. As relatively simple as this API is, I felt that this was  sufficient.   Handling Server-Sent Messages Now, we get to the heart of things: handling the various messages that can come from  the server at various points in the game. For this, we have a single event handler function  set up:  connection.onmessage = function inMessage: any  {    console.log `WS received: ${inMessage.data}` ;    const msgParts: string[] = inMessage.data.split "_" ;   const message: string = msgParts[0];  First, it should be noted that what you receive in this function is an object. This   object, most importantly to us, has a data attribute. This is the string message that was  sent from the server.  327   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  After logging the message that was received, the message is broken into its   constituent part. The first part of the message is a specific message. I know you’re  shaking your head right now at that sentence – I realize it’s confusing! Let me try and  clear it up: the client WebSocket receives a message from the server, and the inMessage  argument represents that. Let’s call this the WebSocket message. But, within that  WebSocket message string is a message that pertains to the game itself, something  application-defined, so that you can call that the game message.  This game message is what this function is concerned with primarily because, next, a   switch statement is used:  switch  message  {    case "connected":     this.state.handleMessage_connected msgParts[1] ;   break;    case "start":     this.state.handleMessage_start JSON.parse msgParts[1]  ;   break;    case "update":     this.state.handleMessage_update        msgParts[1], parseInt msgParts[2]       ;   break;    case "gameOver":     this.state.handleMessage_gameOver msgParts[1] ;   break;  }.bind inParentComponent ;  Each of the four game messages that the server can send is forwarded along to   an appropriate method in the state object to do the actual work associated with each  message, and we’ll be looking at those in the next section. With those calls go the   }  328   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  information in the WebSocket message string following the game message portion,  which is specific to each message. For all but the update message, there’s just a single  piece of information to send, so it’s the second element in the array produced by the call  to split   earlier. For update, two pieces of information are sent.  Finally, because we need all of this to execute within the context of the BaseLayout   component, this onmessage event handler function is bound to inParentComponent.   Sending Messages to the Server The final bit of code found in this source file is a simple method for sending messages to  the server:  this.send = function inMessage: string  {   console.log `WS sending: ${inMessage}` ;   connection.send inMessage ; };  That’s really all there is to it! The caller is presumed to have constructed a valid   message, and the send   method exposed on the WebSocket instance is all it takes to  send it. It couldn’t be easier!  At this point, createSocketComm   in socketComm.ts is done, save for one key thing:  return this;  That’s the final line in this function. That allows the caller to save a reference to the   object, which is needed to be able to call the send   method later.   The Main Code: state.ts Okay, now we come to the final source file that makes up BattleJong, and it’s where most  of the real work is: state.ts. As with MailBag, this code is concerned with constructing  an object that will contain the application state that will be housed in the BaseLayout  component and then flow down to any child components that need it. The methods  exposed as part of this object are concerned with mutating state in some way, but in this  app, that really means it winds up containing a good chunk of the core game logic since  that logic will ultimately mutate state, so it’s logical for it to be here.  329   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  It begins, as most of our modules do, with some imports:  import React from "react"; import { createSocketComm } from ". socketComm";  React is obvious – we won’t get very far building a React app without importing React   itself! – and socketComm, you of course know, is how we talk to the server.   A Few Interface for Good Measure Next up, we find a few interfaces. Note that these are in the TypeScript module that  state.ts represents, but it’s not in the state object that will ultimately be constructed  and used in the rest of the app:  interface ISelectedTile { layer: number,   row: number, column: number, type: number } interface IScores { player: number, opponent: number }  The first, ISelectedTile, is the definition for an object that describes a tile that is  currently selected. It contains all the information that is needed to identify a tile  layer,  row, and column  and it also contains the type of tile it is, and you’ll see why that is  needed very soon.  The IScores interface describes an object that stores the current score of the player   and the remote opponent.  Both of these are used to avoid duplication of code: without them, we’d need to   copy and paste these type definitions in a couple of places in this file’s code – unless we  wanted to skip typing entirely – neither of which is a great option in general.   The Beginning of the State Object Now, it’s finally time to start building the state object itself. This begins very much like  the state object in MailBag did, with a function:  export function createState    inParentComponent: React.Component   {    return {  330   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  We’re returning an object literal, and I usually like to put all my object fields  or   properties  first, and that is indeed what we find first:  layout :  [ ]  The server, you’ll recall, sends the layout of the board to each client when the game   begins. This is where that layout gets stored. But something new is presenting itself here,  and as a result, I think it’s time for…   A Quick Detour: TypeScript-Type Assertions  As in many object-oriented languages, typecasting is sometimes necessary. Typecasting,  in general terms, is when you assign a value of one type to a variable declared as another.  That will sound weird if you’ve never seen it before, but in terms of object-oriented  languages, it makes sense.  Imagine you define a class called Shape. You then define a class called Circle   that extends from Shape. Object orientation tells us that all Circle instances are  also Shape instances due to that inheritance relationship. Therefore, you can have a  variable declared as type Shape that points to an object of type Circle. There’s a bit  more to casting in some cases, but for our purposes here, this is enough to give you  the basic idea.  Casting isn’t purely about objects and classes, though. You can also type primitive  types. For example, in most languages, a variable of type double can reference an int  value because a double can fully contain the value of an int.  In TypeScript, these situations are called type “assertions,” but it essentially means  the same as casting. It’s a purely compile-time mechanism as it has no effect at runtime   it does no special type checking or data restructuring or anything like that , and it’s a  way for you as the programmer to tell the compiler “look, I know more about this type  than you do, so trust me, this is what it is.” That is sometimes necessary because as good  as tsc is, it can’t always determine the type of a reference, and sometimes it’s tricky for  you to be able to tell it.  Such is the case with this layout property. The first problem is that because this is   part of an object literal definition, which means that the colon is already used to separate  the property name from its value, there’s no way to attach a type. In other words, this  won’t work:  layout: number[][][] : []  331   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  It will yield a compiler error due to the ambiguous meaning of the two colons. So,   from a purely syntactical point of view, we need something else. That’s where the angle  brackets placed before the value comes in. This says to tsc: “this value is of the specified  type, whether you know it or not!” Here, you know that the layout passed from the server  is a three-dimensional array of numbers, so we need to express the same type here.  The other problem is that in this case, TypeScript has no way to know what the type  of the value is. Without the cast, all it knows is that it’s an array, but it doesn’t know what  the elements of the array are. Yes, we could, in theory, define it as any[][][], but we’d  still need the cast syntax due to this being a property in an object literal.  Note that there is a second form of casting in TypeScript: using the as keyword. This   line could have been written:  layout : [] as number[][][]  There’s no technical difference between the two forms – they mean the same thing –   so it’s a matter of preference. However, note that in a .tsx file, you must use the as  keyword because the angle bracket approach can yield syntax errors in JSX when used  with TypeScript.  Note  as a general statement, it seems that most typeScript developers have  taken to favoring the as keyword approach. i’m an old Java guy, so my brain  automatically goes to angle brackets. the bottom line is that it’s up to you, but you  may be more in line with most other typeScript developers by sticking with the as  keyword approach.   Back to the Code! Now, getting back to the code in state.ts, we have more properties to declare on the  state object:  selectedTiles :  [ ]  This property, which uses the interface defined earlier as its type  again using type   casting , is where the selected tiles are stored.  332   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Next, we have a property to hold our scores:  scores :  { player : 0, opponent : 0 }  “state” the game is in:  gameState :  "awaitingOpponent"  After that, we have a key property to making everything work, one that tells us what   The game can be in one of five states at a given moment: “awaitingOpponent”  when   you are the first player to connect to the server and are waiting for another to connect ,  “playing”  when the game is being played, obviously! , “deadEnd”  when your board  has dead-ended , “cleared”  when you have cleared your board , and “gameOver”   when both players have either cleared or dead-ended the board and a winner has been  determined . This gameState value changes as various events occur and is primarily  what is used to show the appropriate message in the control area.  The next property is needed when the game has ended:  This value will be set when the server tells the client which player won. Speaking of players, each has a unique ID, as you saw in the last chapter, and we   gameOutcome :  ""  need to store that in state:  pid :  ""  The next property is our socketComm object:  socketComm :  createSocketComm inParentComponent   Note that the type is Function because that’s effectively what gets return by the call   to createSocketComm  .  Finally, we need to keep track of how long it takes the player to clear a tile or, more   precisely, how long it’s been since their last match:  timeSinceLastMatch :  0  Those properties represent all the state  plus the odd socketComm instance, which   isn’t state, per se  needed to make BattleJong work.  333    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Chapter 11   Message Handler Methods After the properties are defined, we find a series of simple methods, the ones called  from the socketComm code in response to the messages that can be sent by the server,  beginning with the handler function for the connected message:  handleMessage_connected : function inPID: string  {   this.setState { pid : inPID } ; }.bind inParentComponent ,  All we need to do when this message is received is store the player ID sent to the   client in state, so that one is very easy.  the server, and the game begins:  The next handler is for the start message, send when the second player connects to   handleMessage_start: function inLayout: number[][][]  {   this.setState {     timeSinceLastMatch : new Date  .getTime  ,     layout : inLayout,     gameState : "playing"   } ; }.bind inParentComponent ,  We need an initial time so that we can determine how long it takes to match the first tile   pair. Of course, we need to store the layout sent from the server too. Finally, the gameState  needs to transition to the playing state. The result of this all being set in state is that the  board will now appear, with the shuffle done by the server showing the appropriate tiles, as a  result of React seeing the change in state and the PlayerBoard component reacting to it.  The next message we need to deal with is update, sent whenever either player clears a tile:  handleMessage_update:   function inPID: string, inScore: number  {   if  inPID !== this.state.pid  {     const scores: IScores = { ...this.state.scores };     scores.opponent = inScore;     this.setState { scores : scores } ;   } }.bind inParentComponent ,  334   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  This method received the player ID of the player the update is for and the new score   for that player. So, we need to see if the message is for the current player or not. If it’s  not, then the scores property is cloned, the opponent’s score is updated, and the scores  object is set back into state, resulting in a screen update. Note that nothing needs to be  done if the update message was for this player because the score will already have been  updated, as you’ll see the code for soon.  The final message is for when the game ends:  handleMessage_gameOver: function inPID: string  {   if  inPID === this.state.pid  {     this.setState { gameState : "gameOver",       gameOutcome : "**** YOU WON! ****" } ;   } else {     this.setState { gameState : "gameOver",       gameOutcome : "Tough luck, you lost : " } ;   } }.bind inParentComponent ,  All we need to do is see if the winning player, as specified by the server, is this   player, based on the player ID. If it is, the “you won” message is set in the state object’s  gameOutcome property; otherwise, the “you lost” message is set. The message will be  displayed on the screen once React triggers the update.   The Big Kahuna: tileClick   Now we come to what is the longest, probably most complex  though it’s still nothing  overly complicated!  and certainly key bit of code that makes BattleJong tick: the one that  gets called any tile you click a tile:  tileClick : function inLayer: number, inRow: number,   inColumn: number  {  335   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The tileClick   method is passed the layer, row, and column of the tile that the   player clicked. That’s all it needs to do its work. But, before it even gets to the real work,  there are a few trivial rejections that need to be done:  if  this.state.gameState !== "playing"  {   return; }  The board isn’t visible until gameState is either “playing” or “gameOver”, but in  the latter case, we don’t want the player to be able to click tiles, so we’ll abort early if  gameState isn’t “playing”.  Next, we need to determine if a tile can be selected:  if  !this.state.canTileBeSelected inLayer, inRow, inColumn   {   return; }  The canTileBeSelected   is a helper function that tells us whether a tile is free, in   terms of Mahjongg rules. Let’s jump over to that function now.   Helper Function: canTileBeSelected    This function, in its entirety, is  canTileBeSelected : function inLayer: number, inRow: number, inColumn:  number : boolean {   return      inLayer == 4        this.state.layout[inLayer + 1][inRow][inColumn] <= 0       &&      inColumn === 0  inColumn === 14        this.state.layout[inLayer][inRow][inColumn - 1] <= 0        this.state.layout[inLayer][inRow][inColumn + 1] <= 0      ; }.bind inParentComponent ,  336   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  The test here is simple:      If the tile is in the topmost layer  4  OR there is no tile above it     AND if the tile is in the first  0  or last  14  column OR there is no tile   to either the left or right of it     THEN it’s free, ELSE it’s not  At this point, we know that the tile can be selected, so we can start the real work,   beginning with cloning the layout  since we’re going to alter it :  const layout: number[][][] = this.state.layout.slice 0 ;  Next, we need to see what the selected tile is, what its type is:  const currentTileValue: number = layout[inLayer][inRow][inColumn];  We need to determine that because of this next check:  if  currentTileValue <= 0  {   return; }  This keeps the player from trying to select a blank space. Following that, we have to grab some other values out of state:  const scores: IScores = { ...this.state.scores }; let gameState: string = this.state.gameState; let timeSinceLastMatch: number = this.state.timeSinceLastMatch; let selectedTiles: ISelectedTile[] = this.state.selectedTiles.slice 0 ;  We need to clone scores because we might be updating it. Likewise, gameState   might be changing  if they clear or dead-end the board , so that’s grabbed too. To  determine how many points they get, if they match a pair  if this is the second tile being  clicked , we will need to know how long it took, so timeSinceLastMatch is needed.  Finally, one way or another, the values in selectedTiles will be changing regardless, so  that gets cloned now too. Doing all of this now just makes the code later a bit cleaner and  removes some redundancy.  337   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  With that done, the true logic can begin. First, we need to deal with the case where   the tile they clicked was already highlighted. In that case, we want to de-highlight it.  When a tile is highlighted, its tile type value gets 1000 added to it, so that’s the basic  check:  if  currentTileValue > 1000  {   layout[inLayer][inRow][inColumn] = currentTileValue - 1000;   for  let i: number = 0; i < selectedTiles.length; i++  {     const selectedTile: ISelectedTile = selectedTiles[i];     if  selectedTile.layer == inLayer &&       selectedTile.row == inRow &&       selectedTile.column == inColumn       {       selectedTiles.splice i, 1 ;       break;     }   } } else {   layout[inLayer][inRow][inColumn] = currentTileValue + 1000;   selectedTiles.push { layer : inLayer, row : inRow,     column : inColumn, type : currentTileValue } ; }  First, we revert the value so that it’s back to just its basic tile type value  101–142 .  Next, we need to remove it from the selectedTiles array. Because this is an array and  not a keyed object, we have little choice but to examine all members of the array; find  the one that has the layer, row, and column value of the tile that was clicked; and then  splice   that element out. There are several ways this code could be written, but I chose  to just do a straight iteration over the array elements to find the match, then break out of  the loop when found  I chose this route not for any specific reason other than it seemed  simplest to me .  The else branch deals with the case where the tile wasn’t previously highlighted. In  that case, we add 1000 to the tile type value to indicate it’s highlighted and then push an  object into the selectedTiles array for this tile.  338   With the highlighting taken care of, we now need to see if there are two tiles selected,   in which case we have some more work to do:  Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  if  selectedTiles.length === 2  {   if  selectedTiles[0].type === selectedTiles[1].type      selectedTiles[0].type == 101      selectedTiles[1].type == 101     {  If the type of both tiles matches, or if either of them is a wildcard  101 , then that’s a  matched pair. When that happens, we first must clear the pair by setting their tile type to  –1 in the layout:  Recall that the PlayerBoard component won’t render anything in a given position   layout[selectedTiles[0].layer][selectedTiles[0].row]   [selectedTiles[0].column] = -1; layout[selectedTiles[1].layer][selectedTiles[1].row]   [selectedTiles[1].column] = -1;  when it sees a tile type of –1.  Next, it’s time to calculate how many points they get:  let calculatedPoints: number = 10; const now: number = new Date  .getTime  ; const timeTaken: number = now - timeSinceLastMatch; const numHalfSeconds: number = Math.trunc timeTaken   500 ; calculatedPoints -= numHalfSeconds; if  calculatedPoints <= 0  {   calculatedPoints = 1; } scores.player += calculatedPoints; timeSinceLastMatch = now;  The way this works is that they start with ten points for a match. From that, we   subtract a point for every half a second taken. But we want to be nice here, so they always  get a minimum of one point. Finally, the player’s score is updated  which is why the logic  is what it is in the “update” message handler as you saw earlier , and we record the new  time in timeSinceLastMatch so that we start counting from this moment toward their  next match.  339   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Next, we have to let the server know what happened via a "match" message:  this.state.socketComm.send  `match_${this.state.pid}_${calculatedPoints}`  ;  The server needs to know the player ID and how many points they got, so that’s the   message that is constructed.  With that out of the way, the next task is to see if the board is either cleared or dead-   ended. For that, another helper function is employed:  const anyMovesLeft: string = this.state.anyMovesLeft layout ;   Helper Function: anyMovesLeft     The anyMovesLeft   function is somewhat complicated, so let’s break it down into bite-  sized nuggets:  anyMovesLeft : function inLayout: number[][][] : string {   let numTiles: number = 0;   const selectableTiles: number[] = [ ];   for  let l: number = 0; l < inLayout.length; l++  {     const layer = inLayout[l];     for  let r: number = 0; r < layer.length; r++  {       const row = layer[r];       for  let c: number = 0; c < row.length; c++  {         const tileVal: number = row[c];         if  tileVal > 0  {           numTiles += 1;           if  this.state.canTileBeSelected l, r, c   {             if  tileVal === 101  {               return "yes";             }             selectableTiles.push tileVal ;           }         }       }     }   }  340   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  Remember that it’s the cloned layout array that we need to examine right now   because the layout property in state hasn’t been updated yet, so that’s why it gets passed  to anyMovesLeft  . Once there, the first task is to get a list of all free tiles. To do this, we  need to iterate through the entire layout – and remember it’s a three-dimensional array.  Thus, we have nested loops here – and for each, call the canTileBeSelected   function.  Now, if a tile is determined to be free, and it’s a wildcard, then we automatically   know that the board has not dead-ended because a wildcard can match any other tile  type. And, because we start with an even number of tiles, and they only ever get removed  in pairs, that means that there must be at least two tiles left. Therefore, there is at least  one move left for sure and we can short-circuit this function by returning “yes” right  then and there.  Otherwise, the tile is pushed into the selectableTiles array for further scrutiny.   That scrutiny begins with a simple check:  if  numTiles === 0  {   return "cleared"; }  Obviously, if there are no tiles at all, then there can be no more moves left! This case   means that the player just cleared the board, so we let the caller know with the return  value “cleared”. By the way, this should make it apparent now why this function can’t  return a simple boolean true or false: because there are actually three outcomes! There  could be a move left, there could be no moves left due to a dead end, or there could be  no moves left due to the board being cleared. The caller needs to differentiate those  outcomes, so a string is returned instead.  At this point, we know that there are still selectable tiles, and we know that there are  no wildcards  i.e., no selectable wildcards – there still could be some unselectable ones .  Therefore, the next trick is to see if there are any matches.  Your initial thought here might be that you would need to iterate over this array and  compare each element to every other element to find at least one match. And certainly,  that would work. But there is a more efficient approach:  const counts: number[] = []; for  let i: number = 0; i < selectableTiles.length; i++  {   if  counts[selectableTiles[i]] === undefined  {     counts[selectableTiles[i]] = 1;  341   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client    } else {     counts[selectableTiles[i]]++;   } }  First, you count how many times each tile type occurs. This uses an associative array,   meaning that the tile type becomes the key of an array element. With that done, the  check to see if there are any matches left becomes very simple:  for  let i: number = 0; i < counts.length; i++  {   if  counts[i] >= 2  {     return "yes";   } }  That’s it! If any element of the array has a value greater than or equal to two, then   that means there is a match left to be made because, remember, we already checked that  these tiles are selectable.  If there are no such values found in the array, then the final possible return value is   returned:    return "no";  So, jumping back to the code in tileClick  , now that we know if there are any   moves left, we can act accordingly:  switch  anyMovesLeft  {   case "no":     gameState = "deadEnd";     this.state.socketComm.send `done_${this.state.pid}` ;   break;   case "cleared":     scores.player += 100;     gameState = "cleared";     this.state.socketComm.send `match_${this.state.pid}_100` ;     this.state.socketComm.send `done_${this.state.pid}` ;   break; }  342   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client  A return from anyMovesLeft   of “no” indicates a dead-ended board, so gameState is  transitioned to that state, and the server is notified that this player is done. A return value  of “cleared” indicates the board was cleared, in which case we give them a point bonus,  in addition to transitioning gameState and telling the server that they are finished. Note  that we must send two messages here because the server needs to know about the point  bonus too. There’s no special message for that, though; we simply tell the server that  another match occurred via the “match” message. It doesn’t matter that one technically  hasn’t occurred. The server only needs the number of points to add here, so we can force  that message to do double duty.  Now, all that logic was for dealing with a pair of tiles being selected, but what   happens if this tile click event was the second tile of an unmatched pair? Well, that’s  where the else branch of the opening if statement comes in:  } else {   layout[selectedTiles[0].layer][selectedTiles[0].row]     [selectedTiles[0].column] =  layout[selectedTiles[0].layer]  [selectedTiles[0].row]          [selectedTiles[0].column] - 1000;   layout[selectedTiles[1].layer][selectedTiles[1].row]     [selectedTiles[1].column] =  layout[selectedTiles[1].layer]  [selectedTiles[1].row]          [selectedTiles[1].column] - 1000; }  In this situation, all we need to do is revert the tile value of the two tiles to their   101–142 range, and we’re done.  Regardless of whether we just handled a matched pair or not, both tiles would be   either cleared or de-selected now, so they need to be removed from selectedTiles:  selectedTiles = [ ];  Only one thing remains to be done, but it is absolutely key:  this.setState {   gameState : gameState,   layout : layout,   selectedTiles : selectedTiles,  343   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client    scores : scores,   timeSinceLastMatch : timeSinceLastMatch } ;  None of the code in tileClick   to this point will have altered state, but that needs  to occur lest nothing change on the screen! So, a quick call to setState   takes care of it.  I didn’t want to introduce any sort of conditional updates here either; I figured it was  easier just to update everything that could have changed, whether it actually did or not.  And with that, our journey through BattleJong is complete!   Suggested Exercises One great thing about a game is there’s never a shortage of things you could do to it  to expand it. I’ll suggest just a few things, some relatively straightforward, some that  would be significantly more challenging  and therefore more useful as a learning  experience :      Introduce the idea of “attack tiles.” Choose one of the existing tile  types and declare it an “attack” type, just like how the wildcards are  handled. When the player matches two of them, they gain an “attack.”  With it, they can click a button  that you’ll add to the control area   and it will send a message to the server that is then sent to their  opponent. The result is that the opponent loses 50 points and gets,  say, four tile pairs added back. Nasty, but fits in with the “battle” part  of BattleJong well! I’d suggest using Material-UI for this, but maybe  you should instead find a different UI library for React, just to get  some other experience?     Add the ability for a player to shuffle their board up to five times per   game. This is often a part of Mahjong Solitaire’s implementations.  It allows a player to get through a dead-ended board, at least a few  times.     Provide alternate tilesets and let the player choose the one they like.  You’ll have to come up with X∗42 tile graphics, where X is how many  tilesets you want to provide.  344   Chapter 11    time for fun: BattleJong, the Client   Summary In this chapter, we built the client side of BattleJong, making it a complete game. You  learned a little more about Webpack, dealing with images specifically, and you saw the  client side of the WebSocket equation. Of course, you got some experience with basic  game design as well, but that was inevitable when building a game, wasn’t it?!  In the next – and final – chapter, we’ll cover one last topic, something that plays a   role in modern application development: app deployment using containers and Docker  specifically.  345   CHAPTER 12  Bringing the Dev Ship into  Harbor: Docker  With both MailBag and BattleJong built, it’s time to touch on one last topic that has  become very common in modern application development to deal with the problem  of application distribution: Docker. In this chapter, you’ll learn what Docker is and  what containerization generically is, and you’ll learn how to “wrap up” both of the  applications we built over the last four chapters together with Docker so that it is quick  and easy to distribute them to other developers  and possibly even end users .   An Introduction to Containers and Containerization Before we even talk about containers, let’s talk about virtual machines, or VMs.  A VM is essentially an emulation of a real, physical computer. You have your actual   computer, which is considered the “host” for a VM, and then on top of that host, you  have some sort of hypervisor. This may sound a bit circular, but a hypervisor is an entity  that allows VMs to be run on top of it. In other words, it’s an abstraction layer between a  VM and the physical host machine it’s running on. The job of a hypervisor is to distribute  the resources of the physical machine – CPU, memory, and so on – between VMs  running on it, and these VMs we call “guests.”  Hypervisors come in two flavors: hosted hypervisors or hardware hypervisors.  The difference is that hosted hypervisors run on top of the host OS, while hardware  hypervisors run underneath the OS. The primary difference is performance: hardware  hypervisors provide much better performance than hosted hypervisors.  However, with either type, a crucial consideration is that the virtual machine  approach is fundamentally heavyweight. What I mean is there is a lot of overhead  involved because, remember, a VM is essentially an emulation of a machine. That’s  right, it’s emulating everything: including the hardware. On any given piece of     Frank Zammetti 2020  F. Zammetti, Modern Full-Stack Development, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-5738-8_12  347   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  physical hardware, regardless of hypervisor type, there will be a limit to how many  VMs you can run on it because of this, and performance will never be quite as good  as a non-VM situation.  Containers seek to avoid this “weight” issue in favor of something lighter on   resources so that physical server resources can be used more efficiently and shared  between more deployed apps, thereby allowing a server to do more.  In contrast to a VM, a container performs operating-system-level virtualization. This  is achieved by abstracting what’s known as “user space,” that is, where your applications  run. There is no emulation occurring with containers. Instead, they actually share kernel  space with the host OS. But a container looks like a VM in most other regards in that  they represent an isolated user space where your applications can run. In this way, you  can have many containers running, all with their own user space but sharing the kernel  resources of the host operating system. This is a far more efficient approach than VMs  and allows for many more containers to run on a given host system.  A key point about containers is that they allow you to package up not only your   application but also its runtime environment. Yes, that means things like a JDK for a Java  application and JavaScript libraries for a Node app, but it also means the underlying  operating system environment. When you create a container, you start from a blueprint  known as an image. The image almost always begins with an operating system and then  has stuff added to it, building up to the final image. So, if you want to package up your  Node application, you will also, in a container, package up a version of, say, Linux that it  will run on.  Containers function as if they were the sole OS on the hardware. Anything running   in them is unaware that they are on a shared system, just like a VM, but it’s still just a  process running on a host system, not a fully emulated computer and OS on top of it, and  it’s not going through a hypervisor like a VM is.  A container relates to an image in that the image is the blueprint, and a container  is an instance of the image. You can think of it like a class-object relationship: classes  are essentially the blueprint that is used to build instances of that class that we then call  objects.  This yields what is perhaps the most significant benefit of containers: a consistent  runtime environment without the overhead of a VM. The host operating system mostly  doesn’t matter  with some caveats concerning cross-platform containers, vis-à-vis  Windows containers on Linux hosts and vice versa . Only what’s in the container  matters, and only what’s in the container will impact the functioning of the app s  in   348   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  that container. You can change the host operating system and know that what’s in the  container will still be the same environment you originally build and so everything will  work as it always has, no fear of breakage due to the host change.  Another benefit of containers is that they start fast, almost instantly in most cases,   which makes them easy to scale. If you have an application running in a container  and the load on it starts getting too heavy, it’s relatively quick and easy  assuming your  application code allows for this  to spin up more containers with instances of your app  running to share the load.  Container capabilities have been built into Linux for many years, but it only began to  gain traction with the introduction of something that made dealing with the technology  much easier: Docker.   The Star of the Show: Docker Using “naked” containers on Linux is… not pleasant. It can be complex to get them  working and, even more so, to manage all the images and containers you may spawn  from them. It’s doable, but it was difficult enough for a long time that containerization  didn’t get used very much. You must deal with two key features of Linux: control groups,  or cgroups, and namespaces. These deal with how processes and their resources can  be grouped, isolated, and managed as a unit by the kernel and limits on what a given  process can see. If that sounds kind of technical and complicated, well, that’s because it  is! Even for those well-versed in Linux, it can get hairy.  That all changed with the introduction of Docker, which is the product of a company   named – not surprisingly – Docker! In simplest terms, Docker is just a set of tools that  makes it easy, from a command line, to build images, create containers, and manage it  all, including interacting with remote repositories of images. For a while, Docker was a  Linux-only technology, but that’s changed in recent years, and you can now use Docker  on every major operating system.  There are three main components to Docker:     Docker daemon – This is a background process that runs on a  host machine that is responsible for various tasks, including the  management, building, running, and distribution of containers. This  is what interacts with the underlying containerization capabilities,  the thing that is kind of not fun to deal with.  349   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker     Docker client – This is a CLI that you interact with, which makes   calls to the daemon on your behalf. This, combined with the daemon,  makes your human interface to the underlying containerization  capabilities much easier to use.     Docker Hub – A public registry of images maintained by the   company Docker. Using Docker Hub is entirely optional, and you  even can set up your own if you wish. In either case, it’s a repository  of images that you can easily pull from to “spin up” containers    “spin up” is a common phrase for when you create a container   from an image .  Once you get Docker installed, it’s the Docker client, and perhaps Docker Hub, that  you’ll interact with. So, let’s see about getting it installed so we can start playing with all  this stuff!   Installing Docker How you install Docker varies from operating system to operating system, so I couldn’t  detail the process for every possible variation here. However, I can tell you that on  Windows, it’s just a regular application installation  assuming you’re running Windows  10 – older versions of Windows are a bit more involved to get set up , and on Linux, it’s  just installing a small handful of packages.  The URL you need to have in mind is this: https:  docs.docker.com install .   This is the official Docker installation page. There, you will find instructions for installing  Docker for a variety of systems. Please visit there and follow the instructions applicable  to your system.  Once you do, the final step will be to test that Docker is running and ready for you to   play with. To do that, drop to a command prompt and execute this command:  At this point, it doesn’t matter what OS you’re using, the commands you issue to   Docker are the same across all of them. You should see a dump of information, most of  which won’t mean much to you yet  though you’re smart and I’m sure you can figure  a lot of it out! . Figure 12-1 is an example of what you might see  the actual data could  differ on your system .  docker info  350   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  Figure 12-1.  Output of the docker info command execution  If you don’t see this, then take the time to go over the installation instructions again   for your system so that you have a reliable Docker environment before we move on.  351   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker   Your First Container: “Hello, World!” of Course! Okay, so, Docker is installed and ready to go, what can we do with it? As is customary  when talking about seemingly anything in programming, we’ll start by spinning up a  “Hello, World!” container. As luck would have it, Docker Hub, the central and public  image repository run by Docker, has just such an image available! We can pull the  image down to our local machine and use it to create a container all with one, simple  command:  docker run hello-world  like Figure 12-2 greet you.  Go ahead and execute that, and after a couple of seconds, you should see something   Figure 12-2.  The Docker hello-world, up and running!  352   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  As I said, this did a couple of things for you automatically, and in fact, part of what it   did was to output, well, precisely what it did! That’s helpful, isn’t it?  Now, if you execute that command again, you’ll find that it’s even faster this time,  and that’s because the image has already been downloaded from Docker Hub and is  stored on your system, so that step can be skipped. Instead, Docker spins up a new  container virtually instantly.  In short, the docker run command is how you start new containers.   A Quick Rundown of Key Docker Commands For most Docker work, only a small handful of commands are needed. Anything more  would constitute more advanced Docker functionality, and as this is meant as only an  introduction, most of that won’t be covered. But let’s look at the basics now.   Listing Images How can you tell what images and containers there are available on your system? Well,  that’s easy:  docker images  That will list all the images downloaded onto your system. Figure 12-3 shows what it   might look like after trying the first example.  Figure 12-3.  A list of images on your system   Listing Containers For listing containers, it’s just as easy:  docker ps  353   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  That shows your containers, but it only shows you running containers. After this   example container finishes its work, it shuts down immediately. Therefore, you won’t see  it listed there. However, the container still exists in a sense, and you can see it by adding  an option to the previous command:  docker ps -a  containers in the Exited state.  Figure 12-4 shows the result which, if you’ve been following along, should show two   Figure 12-4.  The non-running containers on the system   Starting  and Stopping  Containers You could start a container again if you want:  docker start    For this hello-world container, however, nothing will happen when you do this, and  the container will exit immediately. It only seems to show that helpful information when  initially run.  You can also stop a running container:  docker stop    As a quick aside, at this point, you may realize that entering the container IDs   that Docker generates can get annoying in a hurry  and, plus, you’ve seen me write   , implying you can do something other than using the default  ID . Fortunately, Docker also generates a name for each container, as you can see in the  ps output  and it can often be quite entertaining to see what it spits out! . However, it’s  more user-friendly to give it a name yourself, which you can do with an option:  docker run --name MyAwesomeContainer hello-world  Now you should see a container with the specified name, which you can then use to   interact with it.  354   Chapter 12   Remove Containers and Images You’ll probably want to clean up those containers at some point, and there’s a command  for that:   Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  docker rm    If the container is running, Docker won’t let you remove it until you stop it. Likewise, you can remove images:  docker rmi    As with containers, Docker won’t allow you to delete an image that’s used by a  container, regardless of whether it’s running or not, so you’ll need to clean up the  containers first.   Pulling Images What if you want to download some images but not immediately start containers based  on them? That’s easy enough:  docker pull hello-world  Now, the image will be downloaded if it’s not already on your system  if it is, docker  will try to update it if the latest version is newer than what’s on your system . After that,  you can do a docker run to spin up containers like before.  You can push images to a repository as well, but we’ll get to that later.   Searching for Images While I think it’s much easier to go to Docker Hub through the Web to look for images,  which you can do at https:  hub.docker.com , you also can search for an image  directly from the command line:  docker search hello-world  This returns a list of many images that include the string “hello-world” in their name.  355    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  Chapter 12   Attaching to a Container Sometimes, you’ll want to treat containers like VMs and log into them. To demonstrate  that, we’ll need a container that will continue running, so let’s use Nginx for that:  docker run -d -p 8080:80 -name my_nginx nginx  The -d option “detaches” the terminal session from the container, which causes  it to run in the background  assuming whatever is inside the container doesn’t exit  immediately . You’ll be returned to your command prompt, but the container will  continue to run. The -p option is for exposing network ports. Here, we’re saying that port  8080 inside the container should be exposed on port 80 of the host machine’s network  interface.  Once you execute this command, do a docker ps, and you should see a running   container for the first time.  Now, with a container running, we can go ahead and attach to it:  docker exec -it my_nginx  bin bash  Here, you can see a few things. First, the -i option keeps STDIN open so that it can   be interacted with. The -t option allocates a new pseudo-tty terminal session. The    bin bash at the end is a command that is executed after the container is started. All  three combined results in you being “inside” the container. The command prompt  you see at that point is the command prompt inside the container itself. Go ahead and  do some bash-y stuff  e.g., ls , and you should notice that what you see differs from  your host operating system  though if you’re using Ubuntu, then it’s going to look very  similar anyway . Execute the exit command and you’ll be dropped back to your actual  command prompt.   Viewing Container Logs Finally, without attaching to a container, you can view the logs produced inside of it:  docker logs my_nginx  Here, “logs” include anything routed to standard out, barring any specific   configuration done inside the container.  At this point, you know most of the basics for using Docker. But all of that was based   on existing images. What about creating your own? Let’s do that now!  356   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker   Creating Your Own Image Now, as cool as I hope you find Docker at this point, it would be considerably more  useful if we could create images ourselves, wouldn’t it? Let’s do it and find out!  First, we’ll need something to stick in the container. So, let’s start by creating a very  simple Node app. To begin, create a directory – name it dockernode – and then initialize  a new NPM project in it:  npm init  Just accept all defaults for it. Next, add Express to it:  npm install –save express  Finally, create a server.js file and put the following code in it:  const express = require "express" ; const app = express  ; app.get " ",  inRequest, inResponse  => {   inResponse.send "I am running inside a container!" ; } ; app.listen "8080", "0.0.0.0" ; console.log "dockernode ready" ;  You can, at this point, start this little server:  node server.js  You should be able to access it at http:  localhost:8080. Of course, what it returns, “I am running inside a container!”, is a dirty lie at this   point! So, let’s go ahead and make it true!  To do so, we must add another file to the mix: Dockerfile. Yes, that’s literally the   name! A Dockerfile is a file that tells Docker how to build an image. In simplest terms, it  is basically a list of commands that Docker will execute, as if it were you, the user, inside  a container. Virtually any valid bash commands can be put in it, as well as a few Docker-  specific ones. Docker will execute the commands in the order they appear in the file and  whatever the state of the container is at the end becomes the final image.  357   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  So, here’s what we need to put in this Dockerfile for this example:  FROM node:10 WORKDIR  usr src app COPY package*.json .  COPY server.js .  RUN npm install EXPOSE 8080 CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]  The first command, FROM, is a Docker-specific command  the only one required, in   fact  that tells Docker what the base image is. All images must be based on some existing  image. If you want to start “from scratch,” the closest you can generally get is to choose  an image that is nothing but an operating system. In this case, however, since we’re  using Node, we can start from an image that, yes, has an operating system, but then also  has Node already installed on top of it. Alternatively, we could start with an image like  ubuntu, and then put the commands into the Dockerfile that would install Node  apt-  get install nodejs , and we would wind up with an image that is basically the same as  this. But let’s be lazy and use what’s already there!  Note  images can have tags attached to them, which you can roughly think of as  version numbers. here, we’re telling Docker that we want to use the latest image  named node that includes node v10.x. the tags are image-specific, so you’ll need  to consult Docker hub  or whatever repository you’re using  to see what it means  for a given image.  The next command, WORKDIR, really does two things, potentially. First, it creates the   named directory if it doesn’t already exist. Then, it does the equivalent of a cd to that  directory, making it the current working directory for subsequent commands.  Next, two COPY commands are used. This is another Docker command that copies   content from a source directory on the host to a destination directory in the image’s file  system. The command is in the form COPY    , so here we’re saying to copy  from the current working directory on the host  which should be the project directory  to  the current working directory in the image  which is now the one created by the WORKDIR  command  any file named package*.json  which means package.json and package-  lock.json  and our server.js file.  358   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  After that, we must think as if we’re executing these commands ourselves.    If someone gave us this Node project, we would next need to install the dependencies  listed in package.json. So the Docker RUN command is used, which tells Docker to  execute whatever command follows as if we were doing it ourselves at a command  prompt  because remember that basically is what a Dockerfile is! . You know all  about the npm install at this point, so after this is done, all the necessary code for the  application to run is present in the image.  Now, in this case, we need to expose a network port; otherwise, our host system,   let alone any other remote systems, won’t be able to reach our Node app inside the  container. It’s a simple matter of telling it which port to expose, which needs to match  the one specified in the code, obviously.  Finally, we want to specify a command to execute when the container starts up.   There can be only one of these in the file, but we can do virtually anything we want. Here,  we need to execute the equivalent of node server.js as we did manually to test the app.  The CMD command allows us to do this. The format this command takes is an array  of strings where the first element is an executable, and all the remaining elements are  arguments to pass to it.  Once that file is created, it’s time to build the image! That just takes a simple   command invocation:  docker build -t dockernode .  Do that, and you should see an execution something like Figure 12-5.  359   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  Figure 12-5.  Building the dockernode example image  Now, if you do a docker images, you should see the dockernode image there. If it is,   you can spin up a container based on it:  docker run --name dockernode -p 8080:8080 -d dockernode  360   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  At this point, the container should be running  confirm with docker ps , and the app   should be reachable from a web browser. Also, if you do  docker logs dockernode  you should now see the “dockernode ready” string. You could attach to the   container if you wanted to now and play around.  Note  Don’t get confused here: dockernode is the name  tag  of an image,  but it’s also the name assigned to a running container  and also the name of  the project directory . it’s perfectly allowed to have an image tag that matches  a container name; however, you may generally want not to do that to avoid any  potential confusion.  One final thing I want to mention is that it’s a good idea after you build an image – or   if you’re troubleshooting an image that isn’t building right – to check its contents. The  quickest and easiest way to do that is  docker run -it   sh  That’s another way to get an interactive shell into a running container, but it should   generally work with virtually any image and, most importantly, it will work even if the  container shuts down immediately. To be clear, if nothing is running in the container,  that won’t change. If your app crashes on startup, for example, it will still do so. But, now,  you’ll be able to browse the file system, including, critically, any log files that may have  been written.  Of course, if there’s a problem at a lower level, like at the OS level, then this, in fact,   may not work. In such instances, another useful command to know is  docker image inspect    This will provide you detailed information about the image and its history  there is   also a literal docker image history   command too that delves  into an image’s actual build history more .  361   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker   Deploying to Docker Hub Now that you’ve built an image, let’s talk about getting it into a repository, Docker Hub,  specifically  though this all applies to any repository you might interact with .  First, to put an image into Docker Hub  referred to as pushing , you need an account.   So, head on over to hub.docker.com and create an account for yourself. You will be  allowed to have one private repository  where a repository refers to an image essentially   with a free account, as well as unlimited public ones. That’ll be plenty good enough for  what we’re doing here.  Once you set up the account, the next step is to create a repository. To do so,   assuming you’re viewing your account in the Docker Hub web site in a web browser  right now, you should see a Create Repository button right there near the top. Click  that, and then give your repository a name. For the sake of what we’re doing, name it    modern-full-stack-development-dockernode  it’s a good idea to  namespace any of your repositories with your username unless you’re building some  sort of official image that many people would be interested in, think things like Nginx,  Node, or Ubuntu .  Assuming you have the dockernode image built, it’s time to push it to Docker Hub!  To do so, you will first need to log the Docker CLI into Docker Hub. That’s easy enough:  docker login --username    You will then be prompted for your password. Note that if you’ve elected to set up   two-factor authentication, then it won’t be your password you enter but will instead be  the authentication key created when you set that up. But, either way, you should see  something like Figure 12-6.  Figure 12-6.  Logging into Docker Hub from the Docker CLI  362   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  At that point, you’re ready to push your image:  docker push   modern-full-stack-development-dockernode  If you refresh your account page on Docker Hub, you should now see some changes.   Click the repository, and you should see a “latest” tag has been created. That’s it. Your  image is now on Docker Hub!  If you want to test it, delete the image on your system  docker rmi dockernode    and then pull the image  docker pull   modern-full-stack-  development-dockernode  and you should be able to spin up a container based on that.  You could now make that repository public if you wanted, which would then allow   anyone else who wants it to pull your image and use it, or perhaps base their own image on it.   Wrapping Up MailBag and BattleJong Now, you have everything you need to containerize MailBag and BattleJong, which is the  ultimate goal we’ve been working toward.  We’ll start with the source code for MailBag, and for the sake of this exercise, do not   run npm install in either the client or server directories. We want just the “naked”  source code here. All you really need to do is add a Dockerfile:  FROM node:10 WORKDIR  usr app mailbag COPY client . client COPY server . server WORKDIR  usr app mailbag client RUN npm install RUN npx webpack --mode production WORKDIR  usr app mailbag server RUN npm install RUN npx tsc EXPOSE 80 CMD [ "node", ". dist main.js" ]  363   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker  As with dockernode, we’ll start with the plain node image. From that, we create a   directory in the image for the project. Then, we make it our work directory and copy in  both the client and server directories to it. Note that when you copy a directory into an  image, you need to specify the target directory explicitly. Just putting a period won’t work  as it does with files.  After that, since I said not to install the dependencies, we need to get them into the  image. Otherwise, this project won’t run  in fact, it won’t build, let alone run, and you  should realize that we do indeed have to build it since it’s not in its executable form as it  stands . So, the npm install is run after switching to the client directory.  But we still have to build the client because it’s not in its final form – there’s no dist  directory yet – so then it’s just running Webpack to do the job for us. That produces the  dist directory and its contents.  Then, we need to do the same thing for the server, though there we’re just compiling   with tsc, no Webpack involvement there.  Finally, we expose port 80, since that’s what the server listens on, and then start the   server by executing the equivalent of node . dist main.js.  Now, if you do this, you will hit a problem when Docker gets to the RUN npm   webpack –mode production line: it will hang, never completing the image. The reason  is straightforward: remember that we configured Webpack to monitor our files and  automatically rebuild when they change? Well, that’s exactly what it’s going to do as  the image is being built, so it will never complete. To fix that, you need to go into the  webpack.config.js file and set watch to false. After that, the build should be successful  and everything else should work as expected.  For BattleJong, it’s almost exactly the same! Aside from the directory names in the   Dockerfile needing to be changed, of course, everything else should be the same except  for one thing: the final line in the Dockerfile needs to be changed to  CMD [ "node", ". dist server.js" ]  The name of the file that is our server is different, but besides that, it’s the same.  Note  i have created images for both of these apps on Docker hub, as well  as dockernode, and you can pull them any time you want. they are named  fzammetti modern-full-stack-development-dockernode, fzammetti  modern-full-stack-development-mailbag, and fzammetti modern-  full- stack-development-battlejong.  364   Chapter 12    Bringing the Dev Ship into harBor: DoCker   Suggested Exercises This is another of those chapters where suggesting exercises specific to its topic is a  little tough by its very nature. However, one thing immediately comes to mind, and it’s  something that would test all your skills in one go, not just Docker knowledge:  Create a new app using everything you’ve learned throughout this book, package   it with Docker, and push it to Docker Hub for all the world to see!  How about your own game of some sort? Or, maybe a calculator? Perhaps an address   book for contacts? What about copying Google Keep for taking notes? You could always  write an app to store bookmarks.  Basically, anything that interests you, go for it! It doesn’t need to be anything world-  changing; it just has to touch on most, if not all, of the topics I’ve covered in this book. If  you can accomplish that, then I’ve succeeded in my task of teaching you a thing or two!   Summary With this chapter, our journey together through modern application development is  complete! Here, you learned about Docker and containerization, learned how to create  an image from the applications we built together, and saw how to run them.  I genuinely hope you’ve had a great experience with this book and that you’d learned   a great deal. I hope I’ve helped provide you the tool you need to go out into the world  and build wonderful applications using modern tools and techniques. And hey, if you  create the next big thing and get all rich, maybe remember where you got the skills to do  so and throw a coin to your favorite tech author!  365   Index  A addContact   method, 243 addContactToList   state mutator    method, 237  addMailboxToList   method, 235 AJAX, 238 alert   message, 89, 91, 157 anyMovesLeft   function, 340 app.delete   method, 184 Async_hooks module, 40 Axios, 240  B BattleJong  BaseLayout component, 313–316 building, 305, 306 ControlArea component  defining, 316 gameState property, 318, 319 React.Fragment, 316, 317 scores property, 317, 318  index.html, 312 libraries, adding, 311 Mahjong Solitaire, 284 main.tsx file, 313 node modules, adding, 289 PlayerBoard component, 319, 320  noImplicitAny check, 321, 322 ReactElement, 322 project, setting up, 307  TypeScript config file, 308, 309 Webpack, 309, 310  render process  CSSProperties, 324 highlightTile style, 324, 325 onClick handler, 325 xOffset and yOffset, 323 requirements, 285, 306, 307 server, socketComm.ts source file  sending messages, to server, 329 sent messages, 327, 329 WebSockets, 326, 327  setting up project, 286 source file, 311 state.ts  anyMovesLeft   function, 340–344 canTileBeSelected   , 336–339 IScores interface, 330 message handler methods, 334 properties, 332, 333 socketComm, 330 tileClick  , 336 TypeScript-type assertions, 331, 332  tsconfig.json file, 287–289 types, adding, 311  Bookmark component, 55    Frank Zammetti 2020  F.

Explore what React, Node, TypeScript, Webpack, and Docker have to offer individually, and how they all fit together in modern app development. React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and Node.js is extremely popular for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but as developers use the language more, they begin to recognize the shortcomings, and that’s where TypeScript comes in and why it’s gaining in popularity quickly. Add Webpack and Docker to the mix, and you’ve got a potent full development stack on which to build applications. You’ll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing two different real-world apps. These aren’t just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. By the end, you will have a solid grasp of building apps with React, Node.js, and TypeScript and a good grasp on how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own. What You'll Learn Get a project started and logically structure it Construct a user interface with React and Material-UI Use WebSockets for real-time communication between client and server Build a REST API with Node and Express as another approach to client-server communication Package the app with Webpack for optimized delivery Take a completed app and wrap it up with Docker for easy distribution Review a host of other ancillary topics including NPM, Semantic versioning, Babel, NoSQL, and more Who This Book Is For Web developers with basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and CLI tools who are interested in and in all aspects of application development, and using TypeScript instead of straight JavaScript
