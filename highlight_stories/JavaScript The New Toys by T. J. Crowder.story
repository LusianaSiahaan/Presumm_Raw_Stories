ABOUT THE AUTHOR  T.J. CROWDER is a software engineer with 30 years of professional experience, at least half that time  working with JavaScript. He runs Farsight Software, a UK software consulting and product company.  As one of the top 10 contributors on Stack Overflow and the top contributor in the JavaScript tag, he  likes to use what he’s learned to help others with the technical challenges they’re facing, with an  emphasis not just on imparting knowledge, but on helping with the process of solving problems.  T.J. started programming in his early teens in California, playing around with the Apple II and  Sinclair ZX-80 and -81 using BASIC and assembly language. He got his first proper job with comput- ers many years later, working a technical support position for a company with a PC  DOS  product  for court reporters. While working support, he taught himself C from the TurboC manuals in the  office, reverse-engineered the company’s undocumented, compressed binary file format, and used  that knowledge to create a much-requested feature for the product in his spare time  one the com- pany soon started shipping . Before long the development department took him in and over the next  several years gave him the opportunity, resources, and responsibility to grow into a programmer and,  eventually, into their lead engineer, creating various products including their first Windows product.  At his next company he took on a professional services and developer education role that saw him  customizing the company’s enterprise product on-site for clients  using VB6, JavaScript, and HTML   and teaching training classes to the clients’ developers; eventually he was writing the training classes.  A move from the U.S. to London put him back in a straight development role where he was able to  increase his software design, SQL, Java, and JavaScript skills before branching out into independent  contracting.  Since then through circumstance he’s been doing primarily closed-source remote development work  for a variety of companies and organizations  a NATO agency, a UK local government authority, and  various private firms  working primarily in JavaScript, SQL, C, and  recently  TypeScript. The desire  for community led him first to the PrototypeJS mailing list back in the day, then to Stack Overflow,  and now to various platforms.  English and American by birth, American by upbringing, T.J. lives in a village in central England with  his wife and son.    ABOUT THE TECHNICAL EDITOR  CHAIM KRAUSE  is an expert computer programmer with over thirty years of experience to prove it.   He has worked as a lead tech support engineer for ISPs as early as 1995, as a senior developer sup- port engineer with Borland for Delphi, and has worked in Silicon Valley for over a decade in various  roles, including technical support engineer and developer support engineer. He is currently a military  simulation specialist for the US Army’s Command and General Staff College, working on projects  such as developing serious games for use in training exercises. He has also authored several video  training courses on Linux topics, and has been a technical reviewer for over two dozen books.    ABOUT THE TECHNICAL PROOFREADER  MARCIA K. WILBUR  is a technical communicator consulting in the semiconductor field, focusing on  Industrial IoT  IIoT  and AI. Marcia holds degrees in computer science, technical communication,  and information technology. As Copper Linux User Group president, she is heavily involved with the  maker community leading West Side Linux + Pi and the East Valley leading regular Raspberry Pi, Bea- glebone, Banana Pi Pro, and ESP8266 Projects including home automation, gaming consoles, surveil- lance, network, multimedia, and other “pi fun”.    ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  “I wrote a book” is almost never an accurate statement.  Sure, all the unquoted words in the book are mine. But none of them would be here if it weren’t for  others—others offering support, offering perspective, offering encouragement; others reviewing drafts  to help cut the chaff and reveal the nugget of usefulness buried within; others asking questions in a  variety of forums over the years, giving me the opportunity to practice the art and craft of explaining  what meager knowledge I’ve been able to pick up; others answering my questions, directly and by  pointing to resources; others helping hone my language and improve my wordcraft.  All of which waffle means: I owe thanks to a lot of people. This is my first proper book, and I made  just about every mistake there is to make. The people below caught and corrected as many of them as  they could. Any that remain are mine.  Primarily, thanks to my wife Wendy for her amazing support, for being an endless and willing source  of strength and font of encouragement, for bringing me back when  as James Taylor puts it  I find  myself careening in places where I should not let me go.  Thanks to my son James for putting up with Dad being squirrelled away in the office so much.  Thanks to my mother Virginia and father Norman for instilling in me a love of language, learning,  reading, and writing. These are gifts that last a lifetime.  Thanks to my best friend Jock for being an ever-patient sounding board and source of encourage- ment—and, for that matter, for having been instrumental in getting me interested in programming in  the first place.  Thanks to all of my editors and reviewers at Wiley & Sons: Jim Minatel and Pete Gaughan for sup- porting and maintaining the project even in the face of a frustrating author; David Clark and Chaim  Krause for editorial and technical review; Kim Cofer for her excellent copyediting and help with  grammar, syntax, and clarity; to Nancy Bell for her proofreading; to the artists and compositors in  the production department; and to all the others I’ve failed to mention by name for supporting all  aspects of the project.  Thanks to Andreas Bergmaier for helping me keep my technical T’s crossed and I’s dotted—Andreas’  keen eye and deep understanding were a huge help throughout the book.  Thanks to TC39 member Daniel Ehrenberg of Igalia for helping me better understand how TC39  works, and for kindly reviewing and helping me refine Chapter 1. His gentle corrections, input, and  insight dramatically improved that chapter.  Thanks to TC39 member Lars T. Hansen of Mozilla  co-author of the shared memory and atomics  JavaScript proposal  for his kind and invaluable help with getting the details and scope right in Chap- ter 16. His deep knowledge and perspective made all the difference there.  And finally, thanks to you, dear reader, for giving your time and attention to my efforts here. I hope it  serves you well.

You can find nearly all of the information in  this book somewhere on the web if you look hard enough and you’re cautious about what sites you  trust; this book provides all of the technical details in one place, along with showing you how to keep  track of the changes as they continue to be made. You can continue to stay up-to-date via the book’s  website at https:  thenewtoys.dev, where I continue covering new features as they’re added.  WHAT DOES THIS BOOK COVER?  Here’s a glance at what’s in each chapter:  Chapter 1: The New Toys in ES2015–ES2020, and Beyond — begins with introducing vari- ous players in the JavaScript world and some important terminology. Then it describes the  definition of “The New Toys” for the purposes of the book; covers the way new features are  added to JavaScript, how that process is managed, and by whom; and explains how to follow  and participate in that process. It finishes by introducing some tools for using the new toys in  older environments  or using the very newest toys in current environments . Chapter 2: Block-Scoped Declarations: let and const — covers the new declaration keywords  let and const and the new scoping concepts they support, including in-depth coverage of  scoping in loops, particularly the new handling in for loops. Chapter 3: New Function Features — covers the variety of new features related to functions:  arrow functions, default parameter values, rest parameters, the name property, and various  syntax improvements. Chapter 4: Classes — covers the new class feature: the basics, what it is and what it isn’t,  subclassing, super, subclassing built-ins like Array and Error, and the new.target feature.  Chapter 4 leaves coverage of private fields and other features making their way through the  proposals process to Chapter 18. Chapter 5: New Object Features — covers computed property names, shorthand properties,  getting and setting an object’s prototype, the new Symbol type and how it relates to objects,  method syntax, property order, property spread syntax, and a host of new object functions. Chapter 6: Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable Spread, Generators — covers iteration, a pow- erful new tool for collections and lists, and generators, a powerful new way to interact with  functions. Chapter 7: Destructuring — covers this important new syntax and how to use it to extract  data from objects and from arrays and other iterables, with defaults, deep picking, and more.   IntroductIon  xxxii  Chapter 8: Promises — dives deep into this important new tool for coping with asynchronous  processes. Chapter 9: Asynchronous Functions, Iterators, and Generators — goes into detail about the   new async await syntax that lets you use familiar logical flow structures with asynchro- nous code, as well as how asynchronous iterators and generators work and the new   for-await-of loop. Chapter 10: Templates, Tag Functions, and New String Features — describes template literal  syntax, tag functions, and lots of new string features like better Unicode support, updates to  familiar methods, and lots of new methods. Chapter 11: New Array Features, Typed Arrays — covers the wide range of new array meth- ods, various other array updates, typed arrays such as Int32Array, and advanced features  for interacting with typed array data. Chapter 12: Maps and Sets — teaches you all about the new keyed collections Map and Set,  and also their “weak” cousins WeakMap and WeakSet. Chapter 13: Modules — is a deep dive into this exciting and powerful way to organize  your code. Chapter 14: Reflection—Reflect and Proxy — covers the powerful new dynamic metapro- gramming features of the Reflect and Proxy objects and how they relate to one another. Chapter 15: Regular Expression Updates — describes all of the updates to regular expres- sions that have been done the past several years such as new flags, named capture groups,  lookbehind assertions, and new Unicode features. Chapter 16: Shared Memory — covers the complex and potentially difficult area of sharing  memory across threads in a JavaScript program, including covering SharedArrayBuffer and  the Atomics object as well as fundamental concepts and notes on pitfalls. Chapter 17: Miscellany — covers a wide range of things that didn’t quite fit in elsewhere:  BigInt, the new integer literal syntaxes  binary, new octal , optional catch bindings, new  math methods, the exponentiation operator, various additions to the Math object  no pun! ,  tail call optimization, nullish coalescing, optional chaining, and “Annex B”  browser-only   features defined for compatibility reasons. Chapter 18: Upcoming Class Features — takes us a bit into the future, describing enhance- ments to classes that haven’t quite been finished yet but which are far along in the process:  public field declarations, private fields, and private methods. Chapter 19: A Look Ahead . . . — winds up with looking forward to some further enhance- ments currently in the pipeline: top-level await, WeakRefs and cleanup callbacks, RegExp  match indices, Atomics.asyncWait, a couple of new syntax features, legacy RegExp fea- tures, and various upcoming standard library additions. Appendix: Fantastic Features and Where to Find Them —  with apologies to J.K. Rowling    provides lists of the new toys and tells you which chapter covers each of them. The lists are:  Features in Alphabetical Order; New Fundamentals; New Syntax, Keywords, Operators,  Loops, and Similar; New Literal Forms; Standard Library Additions and Changes; and   Miscellaneous.   IntroductIon  WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK  You should read this book if:  ➤➤ You have at least a basic understanding of JavaScript, and ➤➤ You want to learn the new features added in the last several years.  This isn’t an academic book just for experts. It’s a pragmatic book for everyday JavaScript  programmers.  Almost anyone picking up this book is already going to know some of what’s in it, and almost no  one picking up this book will already know all of it. Maybe you’re already clear on the basics of let  and const, but you don’t quite get async functions yet. Maybe promises are old hat to you, but you  saw some syntax you didn’t recognize in some modern code you ran across. You’ll find all of it from  ES2015 through ES2020  and beyond  covered here.  HOW TO USE THIS BOOK  Read Chapter 1. Chapter 1 defines a lot of terms I use throughout the rest of the book. Skipping  Chapter 1 will likely trip you up.  After that, you have a choice to make: read the chapters in order, or jump around?  I’ve laid out the chapters in the order I have for a reason; and I build on the content of earlier  chapters in later chapters. For instance, you’ll learn about promises in Chapter 8, which is impor- tant to understanding async functions in Chapter 9. Naturally, I suggest reading them in the order  I’ve arranged them. But I bet you’re a smart person who knows their own mind; if you jump around  instead, you’ll be just fine.  I do suggest that you read—or at least skim—all of the chapters  with the possible exception of  Chapter 16; more on that in a minute . Even if you think you know a feature, there’s probably  something here that you don’t know, or only think you know. For instance: maybe you’re planning  to skip Chapter 2 because you already know all there is to know about let and const. Maybe you  even know why  for  let i = 0; i < 10; ++i  {  *...*       setTimeout    => console.log i  ; }   creates ten different variables called i, and why using  let a = "ay"; var b = "bee";  at global scope creates a window.b property but doesn’t create a window.a property. Even if you do,  I’d skim Chapter 2 just to be sure there aren’t other wrinkles you haven’t picked up.  xxxiii   IntroductIon  Chapter 16 is a bit of a special case: it’s about sharing memory between threads. Most JavaScript pro- grammers don’t need to share memory between threads. Some of you will, and that’s why Chapter 16  is there, but most won’t and if you’re in that category, just tuck away the fact that if you think you  need shared memory at some point in the future you can come back and learn about it in Chapter 16.  That’s just fine.  Beyond all that: run the examples, experiment with them, and above all enjoy yourself.  HOW TO CONTACT THE AUTHOR  I’d love to hear your feedback.

JavaScript has changed a lot in the last few years.  If you were an active JavaScript developer in the 2000s, for a while there you could be forgiven  for thinking JavaScript was standing still. After the 3rd Edition specification in December 1999,   developers were waiting fully 10 years for the next edition of the specification. From the out- side, it seemed like nothing was happening. In fact, lots of work was being done; it just wasn’t  finding its way into the official specification and multiple JavaScript engines. We could  but  won’t  spend an entire chapter—if not a book—on what various different groups in important  positions vis-à-vis JavaScript were doing and how they couldn’t agree on a common path   forward for some time. The key thing is that they ultimately did agree on a way forward, at a  fateful meeting in Oslo in July 2008 after much advance negotiation. That common ground,    2  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  which Brendan Eich  creator of JavaScript  later called Harmony, paved the way for the 5th Edition  specification in December 2009  the 4th Edition was never completed , and laid the basis for ongo- ing progress.  And my, how things have progressed.  In this chapter, you’ll get an overview of the new features since 2009  which the rest of the book cov- ers in detail . You’ll learn who’s in charge of moving JavaScript forward, what process is now used to  do so, and how you can keep track of what’s coming and get involved if you like. You’ll learn about  tools you can use to write modern JavaScript today, even if you have to target environments that  haven’t kept up.  DEFINITIONS, WHO’S WHO, AND TERMINOLOGY  To talk about what’s going on with JavaScript, we need to define some names and common  terminology.  Ecma? ECMAScript? TC39?  What we think of as “JavaScript” is standardized as “ECMAScript” by Ecma International,1 a  standards organization responsible for multiple computing standards. The ECMAScript standard is  ECMA-262. The people in charge of the standard are members of Ecma International Technical Com- mittee 39  “TC39” , charged with “Standardization of the general purpose, cross platform, vendor- neutral programming language ECMAScript. This includes the language syntax, semantics, and  libraries and complementary technologies that support the language.”2 They manage other standards  as well, such as the JSON Syntax Specification  ECMA-404 , and notably the ECMAScript Interna- tionalization API Specification  ECMA-402 .  In this book and in common usage, JavaScript is ECMAScript and vice versa. Sometimes, particularly  during the decade of different groups doing different things, “JavaScript” was used to specifically  mean the language Mozilla was developing  which had several features that either never made it  into ECMAScript, or changed markedly before they did , but since Harmony that usage is increas- ingly outdated.  ES6? ES7? ES2015? ES2020?  Having all these various abbreviations can be confusing, not least because some have edition numbers  but others have years. This section explains what they are and why there are two kinds of them.  Up through the 5th Edition, TC39 referred to versions of the specification via their edition number.  The full title of the 5th Edition spec is:  Standard ECMA-262 5th Edition   December 2009 ECMAScript Language Specification  1  Formerly known as the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association  ECMA , but now only the E in Ecma is     capitalized in the organization’s name.  2 http:  www.ecma-international.org memento TC39.htm   Definitions, Who’s Who, and Terminology  ❘  3  Since “ECMAScript 5th Edition” is a bit of a mouthful, saying “ES5” was the natural thing to do.  Starting with the 6th Edition in 2015, TC39 adopted a continual improvement process where the  specification is a living editor’s draft3 with annual snapshots.  More about that later in this chapter.   When they did that, they added the year to the language name:  Standard ECMA-262 6th Edition   June 2015 ECMAScript® 2015 Language Specification  So the ECMAScript 6th Edition standard  “ES6”  defines ECMAScript 2015, or “ES2015” for short.  Prior to publication, “ES6” became a buzzword of its own and is still in common usage.  Unfortu- nately, it’s often used inaccurately, referring not just to features from ES2015, but also to features that  came afterward in ES2016, ES2017, and so on.   That’s why there are two styles, the style using the edition  ES6, ES7, . . .  and the style using the  year  ES2015, ES2016, . . . . Which you use is up to you. ES6 is ES2015  or sometimes, incorrectly,  ES2015+ , ES7 is ES2016, ES8 is ES2017, and so on through  as of this book’s release  ES11, which  is ES2020. You’ll also see “ESnext” or “ES.next,” which are sometimes used to refer to upcom- ing changes.  In this book, I use what I see as the emerging consensus: the old style for ES5 and earlier, and the new  style for ES2015 and later.  All of that said, although I will usually call out the specific edition where a feature was introduced,  the fact that Array.prototype.includes is from ES2016 and Object.values is from ES2017  doesn’t really matter very much. What matters more is what’s actually supported in your target  environments and whether you need to either refrain from using a specific feature, or transpile and or  polyfill it.  More on transpiling and polyfilling later in the “Using Today’s Toys in Yesterday’s Envi- ronments, and Tomorrow’s Toys Today” section.   JavaScript “Engines,” Browsers, and Others  In this book I’ll use the term “JavaScript engine” to refer to the software component that runs Java- Script code. A JavaScript engine must know how to:  ➤➤ Parse JavaScript, ➤➤ Either interpret it or compile it to machine code  or both , and ➤➤ Run the result within an environment that works as described by the specification.  JavaScript engines are also sometimes called virtual machines, or VMs for short.  One usual place you find JavaScript engines is in web browsers, of course:  ➤➤ Google’s Chrome browser uses their V8 engine  also used in Chromium, Opera, and Micro-  soft Edge v79 and later , except on iOS  more on that in a bit .  ➤➤ Apple’s Safari browser  for Mac OS and for iOS  uses their JavaScriptCore engine.  3 https:  tc39.es ecma262    4  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  ➤➤ Mozilla’s Firefox uses their SpiderMonkey engine, except on iOS. ➤➤ Microsoft’s Internet Explorer uses their JScript engine, which is increasingly out of date as it   only gets security fixes.  ➤➤ Microsoft Edge v44 and earlier  “Legacy Edge”  uses Microsoft’s Chakra engine. In    January 2020, Edge v79 was released, which is based on the Chromium project and uses   the V8 engine, except on iOS.  The version number jumped from 44 to 79 to align with  Chromium.  Chakra is still used in various products that use the Microsoft WebView   control, such as Microsoft Office JavaScript add-ins, though it may be replaced at some  stage.  WebView2, using Chromium Edge, is in developer preview as of early 2020.   Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers running on Apple’s iOS operating system for iPad and  iPhone can’t currently use their own JavaScript engines, because to compile and run JavaScript  rather  than just interpreting it , they have to allocate executable memory, and only Apple’s own iOS apps  are allowed to do that, not ones from other vendors. So Chrome and Firefox  and others  have to  use Apple’s JavaScriptCore instead on iOS even though they use their own engine on desktop and  Android.  At least, that’s true for now; the V8 team added an “interpreter only” mode to V8 in 2019,  which means Chrome and others using V8 could use that mode on iOS, since it doesn’t have to use  executable memory.  In this book, if I say something is “supported by Chrome” or “supported by  Firefox,” I’m referring to the non-iOS versions using V8 or SpiderMonkey, respectively.  JavaScript engines are also used in desktop applications  Electron,4 React Native,5 and others , web  servers and other kinds of servers  often using Node.js6 , non-web applications, embedded apps—just  about everywhere.  WHAT ARE THE “NEW TOYS”?  For this book, the “new toys” are the new features added to JavaScript in ES2015 through ES2020   and previewing some that are coming soon . The language has come a long way in those six updates.  The following is a general overview.  Appendix A has a more complete list of changes.  Some of  the terms on the list may be unfamiliar; don’t worry about that, you'll learn them across the course  of the book.  ➤➤ Opt-in block scope  let, const : Narrower scoping for variables, clever handling of for   loop body scope, “variables” whose value cannot change  const   ➤➤ “Arrow” functions: Lightweight, concise functions that are particularly useful for call-  backs since they close over this rather than having their own this value that’s set when  they’re called  ➤➤ Improvements to function parameters: Default values; parameter destructuring, “rest”   parameters, trailing commas  ➤➤ Iterable objects: Well-defined semantics for creating and consuming iterable objects  such  as arrays and strings , in-language iteration constructs  for-of, for-await-of ; generator  functions for generating sequences that can be iterated  including asynchronous sequences   4 https:  www.electronjs.org  5 https:  reactnative.dev  6 https:  nodejs.org    What Are the “New Toys”?  ❘  5  ➤➤ “Spread” syntax: Spreading out array  or other iterable  entries into new arrays, spreading   out object properties into new objects, and spreading out iterable entries into discrete  function arguments; particularly useful for functional programming, or anywhere immu- table structures are used  ➤➤ “Rest” syntax: Gathering together the “rest” of an object’s properties, an iterable’s values,   or a function’s arguments into an object or array  ➤➤ Other syntax improvements: Allowing a trailing comma in the argument list when calling  a function; omitting unused identifiers in catch clauses; new-style octal literals; binary lit- erals; separator characters in numeric literals; and more  ➤➤ Destructuring: Picking out the values from arrays objects in a concise way that mirrors   object and array literal syntax  ➤➤ class: Markedly simpler, declarative syntax for creating constructor functions and associ-  ated prototype objects, while preserving JavaScript’s inherent prototypical nature  ➤➤ Asynchronous programming improvements: Promises, async functions and await; these   markedly decrease “callback hell”  ➤➤ Object literal improvements: Computed property names, shorthand properties, method   syntax, trailing commas after property definitions  ➤➤ Template literals: A simple, declarative way to create strings with dynamic content, and go   beyond strings with tagged template functions  ➤➤ Typed arrays: Low-level true arrays for using native APIs  and more  ➤➤ Shared memory: The ability to genuinely share memory between JavaScript threads    including inter-thread coordination primitives   ➤➤ Unicode string improvements: Unicode code point escape sequences; support for accessing   code points instead of code units  ➤➤ Regular Expression improvements: Lookbehind assertions; named capture groups; capture   indices; Unicode property escapes; Unicode case insensitivity  ➤➤ Maps: Key value collections where the keys don’t have to be strings ➤➤ Sets: Collections of unique values with well-defined semantics ➤➤ WeakMap, WeakSet, and WeakRef: Built-ins for holding only weak references to objects    allowing them to be garbage collected   ➤➤ Standard library additions: New methods on Object, Array, Array.prototype, String,   String.prototype, Math, and others  ➤➤ Support for dynamic metaprogramming: Proxy and Reflect ➤➤ Symbols: Guaranteed-unique values  particularly useful for unique property names  ➤➤ BigInt: Arbitrary precision integers ➤➤ Many, many others   6  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  All these new features, in particular the new syntax, could be overwhelming. Don’t be concerned!  There’s no need to adopt new features until unless you’re ready to and have need of them. One of the  key principles TC39 adheres to is “Don’t break the web.” That means that JavaScript must remain  “web compatible”—that is, compatible with the huge body of code that already exists in the world  today.7 If you don’t need a new feature, or you don’t like a new feature, you don’t have to use it. Your  old way of doing whatever that feature does will always continue to work. But in many cases, you’re  likely to find there’s a compelling reason for the new feature, in particular new syntax features: they  make something simpler and less error-prone to write and understand, or—in the case of Proxy and  WeakMap WeakSet, shared memory, and others—they enable things that mostly couldn’t be done  without them.  For space reasons, this book only covers the new toys in the JavaScript specification itself, ECMA- 262. But there are some exciting new toys in the ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification8  as well, ECMA-402, which is well worth reading. You can find coverage of ECMA-402 on this book’s  website at https:  thenewtoys.dev internationalization.  HOW DO NEW TOYS GET CREATED?  In this section you’ll learn who’s in charge of moving JavaScript forward, what process they use to do  so, and how to follow and participate in that process.  Who’s in Charge  You learned earlier that Ecma International’s Technical Committee 39  TC39  is in charge of creat- ing and releasing updated specifications for the ECMAScript standard. The committee is made up of  JavaScript developers, framework authors, large website authors maintainers, programming language  researchers, representatives from all the major JavaScript engines, influential JavaScripters, and other  stakeholders in JavaScript’s success and future.

To participate in meetings as a member, your organization can join Ecma.9 TC39  navigates the difficult waters of developers’ desires, implementation complexity, security concerns,  backward compatibility, and many other design inputs to bring new and useful features to the Java- Script community.  To ensure that the committee works as part of the community rather than separate from it, TC39  maintains the ecma262 GitHub repository10 with the up-to-date specification  browsable at   https:  tc39.es ecma262   and a proposals repository11 for proposals going through the   TC39 process described in the next section. Some members are also active on the TC39 Discourse  group.12 Notes of the TC39 meetings and associated materials  slides, etc.  are posted to   https:  github.com tc39 notes.  7 The committee also cares about significant JavaScript code that isn’t directly related to the web, too. 8 https:  tc39.es ecma402  9 https:  ecma-international.org memento join.htm 10 https:  github.com tc39 ecma262 11 https:  github.com tc39 proposals 12 https:  es.discourse.group    How Do New Toys Get Created?  ❘  7  You can learn more about TC39, and how to get involved, at https:  tc39.es . You can also learn  more about how TC39 works at https:  github.com tc39 how-we-work.  The Process  TC39 adopted a well-defined process in November 2013 and first published it in January 2014. The  process has multiple stages that TC39 moves proposals through  Stage 0 through Stage 4 , with clear  expectations at each stage, and clear criteria for moving from one stage to the next. Once a proposal  meets the criteria to move to the next stage, the committee decides by consensus whether to move  it forward.  It’s worth reading the process document itself,13 but in brief, the stages are:  ➤➤ Stage 0 – Strawperson: Someone’s had an idea they think is worth considering so they’ve  thought about it, written it up a bit, and put it forward.  This stage almost isn’t a stage,  and the term has been applied to different things at different times.  If the person putting it  forward isn’t a TC39 member, they need to register as a non-member contributor14  which  anyone can do . Some Stage 0 proposals end up being listed in the TC39 proposals reposi- tory, but others don’t; typically it’s just ones that have gained a potential champion who is a  committee member. If a Stage 0 proposal gains enough interest, a TC39 member may get it  added to the agenda for a TC39 meeting to be discussed and considered for Stage 1.  ➤➤ Stage 1 – Proposal: Once a proposal has been put to the committee and there’s consensus   to investigate it further, the committee moves it to Stage 1 with a champion to guide it  through the process. If there isn’t already a GitHub repo for it, the originator or champion  or another interested party creates one. Then members of the community  whether on the  committee or not  discuss it, develop it further, research similar technology in other lan- guages or environments, refine the scope, figure out the general form of a solution, and gen- erally flesh out the idea. As a result of this work, it might turn out that the benefits aren’t  worth the costs, or it could be that the idea needs to be broken up and added to other pro- posals, etc. But if the proposal has legs, the people involved  who may have changed over  time  will put together some initial draft specification language, API, and semantics and put  it forward to TC39 to be considered for Stage 2.  ➤➤ Stage 2 – Draft: When it’s ready, a Stage 1 proposal can be presented at a TC39 meeting to  be considered for Stage 2. This means seeking consensus that the proposal should go ahead,  with the expectation it will likely go through the entire process. Stage 2 is the stage where  the community refines the precise syntax, semantics, API, and so on and describes the solu- tion in detail using formal specification language. Often, polyfills and or Babel plugins get  created at this stage to enable experimentation with real use. Depending on its scope, a pro- posal may stay at Stage 2 for some time as the details are worked out.  13 https:  tc39.es process-document  14 https:  tc39.es agreements contributor    8  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  ➤➤ Stage 3 – Candidate: Once the team has matured a proposal to a final draft form and cre-  ated formal specification language for it, the champion can put it forward for Stage 3. This  means seeking consensus that the proposal is ready to be implemented in JavaScript engines.  At Stage 3, the proposal itself is nearly stable. Changes at this point are expected to be  limited to implementation-driven feedback, such as corner cases discovered during imple- mentation, web-compatibility issues, or difficulty of implementation.  ➤➤ Stage 4 – Finished: At this point, the feature is complete and is ready to be added to the   editor’s draft at https:  tc39.es ecma262 . To reach this final stage, the feature must have  acceptance tests in TC39’s test262 test suite;15 at least two distinct compatible implementa- tions that pass the tests  for instance, shipping in V8 in Chrome Canary and SpiderMonkey  in Firefox Nightly, or SpiderMonkey in Firefox and JavaScriptCore in Safari Tech Preview,  etc. . Once those criteria are met, the final step to reach Stage 4 is for the team working on  the feature to send a pull request to the ecma262 repository to incorporate the specification  changes into the editor’s draft , and the ECMAScript editor group to accept that PR.  That’s the process proposals go through to become part of JavaScript. But not every change is a pro- posal. Smaller changes can be made through consensus at TC39 meetings based on a pull request to  the specification. For instance, the output of Date.prototype.toString changed between ES2017  and ES2018  see Chapter 17  as the result of consensus on a pull request, not a staged proposal.  Often, these are editorial changes, or changes reflecting the reality of what JavaScript engines already  do but which isn’t in the specification, or changes to what the specification says to do that have been  agreed on because TC39 believes they’re both desirable and “web compatible”  won’t break a large  amount of existing code , such as the change in ES2019 making Array.prototype.sort a stable  sort  see Chapter 11 . If you want to know what changes are being considered or made in this way,  watch the “needs consensus” label in the https:  github.com tc39 ecma262 repo  and similarly  the https:  github.com tc39 ecma402 repo for ECMA-402 changes . To find ones that have been  completed, look in the “has consensus,” “editorial change,” and or “normative change” labels. At  some point there may be a more formal process for these “needs consensus” changes, but for now this  is how you watch for them.  Getting Involved  If you see a proposal that interests you and you want to get involved, when should you do that? What  should that involvement look like?  One key thing is: get involved early. Once a proposal has reached Stage 3, only critical changes based  on implementation experience are typically considered. The best times to get involved are at   Stages 0, 1, and 2. That’s when you can provide insight based on your experience, help define seman- tics, try out what’s being proposed using tools like Babel  which you’ll learn about in a later  section ,  etc. It’s not that you can’t find a useful role in a Stage 3 proposal  there are sometimes tasks to be  done in terms of firming up specification text or helping write developer documentation , just be  aware that suggesting changes at Stage 3 usually isn’t useful unless you’re one of the people imple- menting it in a JavaScript engine and you run into a problem.  15 https:  github.com tc39 test262   Keeping Up with the New Toys  ❘  9  So: you’ve found a proposal you want to get involved in; what now? It’s up to you, but here are some  suggestions:  ➤➤ Do your research. Read the proposal’s explainer  the README.md that’s linked from the TC39  list of proposals  and other documents closely and carefully. If they refer to prior art  such as  a similar feature in another language , it’s useful to read up on that prior art. If there’s initial  specification text, read it.  This guide may be helpful there: https:  timothygu.me es-howto .   You want to be sure that the input you provide is well-informed.  ➤➤ Try the feature out! Even if you can’t use it yet, you can write speculative code  code you  can’t run, but can think about  to consider how well the proposal is solving the problem it  sets out to solve. If there’s a Babel plugin for it, try writing and running code. See how the  feature works for you and provide feedback on it.  ➤➤ Look for ways you can help. Aside from suggestions and feedback, there are lots of ways  to help with a proposal. For instance, you can look for issues where a consensus has been  reached about what to do, but no one’s had the time to do it  researching prior art, updating  the explainer, updating spec text . You could do those updates, if it’s something you’re com- fortable doing. You can coordinate with the proposal authors by discussing contributions in  GitHub issues.  When getting involved, remember to treat everyone with respect and to be friendly, patient, inclusive,  and considerate. Be careful with the words you choose. You’re more likely to have influence by treat- ing people well and demonstrating a collaborative spirit than by seeming cross, dismissive, or obstruc- tive. Note that TC39’s meetings and online spaces used to develop proposals are governed by a Code  of Conduct.16 Please refer improper conduct to TC39’s Code of Conduct committee  see the linked  document .  KEEPING UP WITH THE NEW TOYS  You don’t have to keep up with the new toys. As I’ve mentioned, your old way of doing things isn’t  going away. But if you’re reading this book, I suspect you want to.  As you were reading through the process earlier, one thing that may have stricken you is that the  process guarantees that new features make it into the real world before they are added to the specifi- cation. In contrast, when ES5 came out in 2009 and ES2015 came out in 2015, most of the features  they described didn’t exist  in the form described  in any JavaScript engine then shipping. If the spec  follows the new features rather than the other way around, how do you keep up with what features  are coming next? Here are some ways:  ➤➤ Watch the proposals repository on GitHub  https:  github.com tc39 proposals . If  something gets to Stage 3, it’s probably going to get added within a year or two. Even   Stage 2 features are at least likely to get added eventually, though any feature can be  rejected by TC39 at nearly any stage.  16 https:  tc39.es code-of-conduct    10  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  ➤➤ Read the meeting notes of TC39 meetings posted at https:  github.com tc39 notes. ➤➤ Participate in the TC39 Discourse group  https:  es.discourse.group  .17 ➤➤ Pay attention to what’s going on with the tools discussed in the next section.  You can also follow along at https:  thenewtoys.dev, where I continue coverage of what’s  coming next.  USING TODAY’S TOYS IN YESTERDAY’S ENVIRONMENTS, AND  TOMORROW’S TOYS TODAY  In terms of just learning the features covered in this book, you don’t need to worry about deal- ing with environments that don’t support them; nearly everything covered  other than Chapters 18  and 19  is supported by current versions of the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge desktop browsers  and Node.js at least. Simply use one of those to run the code.  USING NODE.JS TO RUN EXAMPLES  By default, when you run a script with Node.js, like this:      node script.js  it runs it at module scope, not global scope. A few examples in this book demon- strate things that only happen at global scope, so they won’t work when you run the  code that way.  For those examples, either use a browser to run the code, or use Node.js’s read  evaluate print loop  REPL  instead. To use the REPL, you don’t specify the script  file to run as an argument to the node command. Instead, you redirect the script  into it using the < operator  this works both on Unix Linux Mac OS systems and  on Windows :      node < script.js  I’ll remind you to do this when an example needs to be run at global scope.  At some stage, though, you’re likely to want to use new features in an environment that doesn’t sup- port them. For instance, most JavaScript development still targets web browsers, and the JavaScript  engines in different browsers get new features at different times  if at all—Internet Explorer doesn’t  support any of the new features discussed in this book,18 but still has some global market share as of  this writing, particularly in government and large company intranets .  17  The Discourse instance largely replaces the informal discussion es-discuss mailing list. The list still exists, but many   TC39 representatives recommend avoiding its use.  18 At least not properly; it has an incomplete version of let and const.   Using Today’s Toys in Yesterday’s Environments, and Tomorrow’s Toys Today  ❘  11  This was an issue when ES5 was released, since very little of it was implemented in any shipping  JavaScript engine at the time. But most of ES5 was new standard library features, rather than signifi- cant syntax changes, so those could be “polyfilled”  added by including an extra script that provided  the missing objects functions  using various projects like es5-shim.js,19 core-js,20 es-shims,21 or similar.  During the development of ES2015 in 2010 through 2015, though, it was clear that real-world expe- rience of new syntax was required to do a good job of developing that syntax, but JavaScript imple- mentations didn’t have the new syntax yet—an apparent catch-22.  Tool builders to the rescue! They created tools like Traceur22 and Babel23  formerly 6to5 , which take  source code using the new syntax as input, convert it to use older syntax, and output that older-style  code  along, optionally, with polyfills and other runtime support functions . Similarly, TypeScript24  supported major parts of what would become ES2015 well before the specification was completed.  These tools let you write new-style code, but convert it to old-style code before delivering it to old  environments. This conversion process is variously called “compiling” or “transpiling.” This was ini- tially handy for feedback on the JavaScript improvements being planned for ES2015, but even when  ES2015 came out it was a useful way to write new-style code if you were planning to run it in an  environment without the new features.  As of this writing, Traceur has gone quiet, but Babel is in use by a large fraction of JavaScript devel- opers worldwide. Babel has transforms for nearly all features that are in the process, even ones at  Stage 1, which may change markedly before progressing.  So use those at your own risk. Stage 3  onward are fairly safe to use.  You select the transform plugins you want to use, write your code  using those features, and Babel produces code you can use in environments without those features.  Transpiling an Example with Babel  In this section, we’ll take a quick look at using Babel to transpile code using an ES2015 feature, called  an arrow function, into ES5-compatible code that works on IE11. But this is just an example; you  could just as easily use Babel to transform code using a Stage 3 feature not yet present in any ship- ping JavaScript engine into ES2020-compatible code. Babel also supports some transforms that aren’t  in the process at all, such as JSX25  used in some JavaScript frameworks, notably React26 . The truly  adventurous can write their own transform plugins just for use on their projects!  To install Babel, you’ll want Node.js and npm  Node Package Manager . If you don’t already have  those installed on your system, either:  ➤➤ Go to https:  nodejs.org  and use the appropriate installer package for your system to   install it; or  ➤➤ Use the Node Version Manager, which provides a handy way to install Node versions and to   switch between them: https:  github.com nvm-sh nvm  npm comes bundled with Node.js, so you don’t have to install it separately.  19 https:  github.com es-shims es5-shim 20 https:  github.com zloirock core-js 21 https:  github.com es-shims  22 https:  github.com google traceur-compiler 23 http:  babeljs.io  24 http:  typescriptlang.org  25 https:  facebook.github.io jsx  26 https:  reactjs.org    12  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  Once you have them installed:  1.  Create a directory for this example  for instance, example in your home directory . 2.  Open a command prompt terminal window and change to the directory you just created. 3.  Use npm to create a package.json file: Type  npm init  and press Enter. npm will ask a series of questions; answer the questions as you like  or just  press Enter in response to all of them . When done, it will write out package.json to your  example directory.  4.  Next, install Babel.  The following steps are from going to https:  babeljs.io docs   setup installation and then clicking the CLI button; you might want to check there for  updates.  Type  npm install --save-dev @babel core @babel cli  and press Enter. npm will download and install Babel, its command-line interface, and all  of its dependencies into your example project.  You may get a warning related to a module  called fsevents and or some deprecation warnings; that’s okay.   5.  At this point, you could start using Babel by calling it directly, but let’s make it easier by  adding an npm script entry to package.json. Open package.json in your favorite edi- tor. If there isn’t a top-level scripts entry, create one  but current versions of npm will  have included one with a test script that shows an error . Within the scripts entry, add  this setting:   "build": "babel src -d lib"  Now your package.json should look something like Listing 1-1.  Yours may still have a  test entry in scripts; that’s fine. It also may have a different license, I always change the  default to MIT.  Make sure to save the file.  LISTING 1-1:  Example package.json—package.json  {   "name": "example",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "",   "main": "index.js",   "scripts": {     "build": "babel src -d lib"   },   "author": "",   "license": "MIT",   "devDependencies": {     "@babel cli": "^7.2.3",     "@babel core": "^7.2.2"   } }   Using Today’s Toys in Yesterday’s Environments, and Tomorrow’s Toys Today  ❘  13  6.  Babel is highly modular. Although we’ve installed it, we haven’t told it to do anything yet. For   this example, we’ll use one of its presets to tell it to transform ES2015 code to ES5 code, by  installing and then configuring the preset. To install the preset, type  npm install --save-dev babel-preset-env  and press Enter. In the next step we’ll configure it.  7.  Now we need to create a configuration file for Babel, .babelrc  note the leading dot . Cre-  ate the file with these contents  or use the one from the chapter downloads :  {   "presets": [     [       "env",       {         "targets": {           "ie": "11"         }       }     ]   ] }  That configuration tells Babel to use its env preset, which the Babel documentation describes as   “. . . a smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which   syntax transforms . . . are needed by your target environment s .” In this configuration, setting the  target "ie": "11" tells the env preset that you’re targeting IE11, which is appropriate for the follow- ing example. For your real use, you’ll want to look at the documentation for the env preset27 and or  other presets or plugins you may want to use instead.  That’s it for the Babel setup for this example. Now let’s create some code for it to transpile. Create  a subdirectory of your example directory called src, and create a file in it called index.js with the  contents of Listing 1-2.  At the end of the process, I’ll show you a list of what files should be where,  so don’t worry too much if you’re slightly unsure; just create the file and you can move it if it ends up  in the wrong place.   LISTING 1-2:  ES2015 transpiling example input—index.js  var obj = {     rex:  \d ,     checkArray: function array  {         return array.some entry => this.rex.test entry  ;     } }; console.log obj.checkArray ["no", "digits", "in", "this", "array"]  ;    false console.log obj.checkArray ["this", "array", "has", "1", "digit"]  ;     true  27 https:  babeljs.io docs en babel-preset-envdocsNav   14  ❘  CHAPTER 1    The New Toys iN es2015–es2020, aNd BeyoNd  The code in Listing 1-2 uses just one ES2015+ feature: an arrow function, the entry =>   this.rex.test entry  within the call to some, which I’ve highlighted in the code.  Yes, that’s   really a function.  You’ll learn about arrow functions in Chapter 3. The brief, incomplete version is  that they offer a concise way to define a function  as you can see  and that they close over this   just like closing over a variable  rather than having this set by how they’re called . When   obj.checkArray ...  is called, this within the call refers to obj even within the some callback,   so this.rex refers to the rex property on obj. That wouldn’t be true if the callback were a   traditional function.  At this point, your example directory should have these contents:  example  +−− node_modules     +−−  various directories and files  +−− src     +−− index.js +−− .babelrc +−− package.json +−− package-lock.json  You’re ready to transpile! Type  npm run build  and press Enter. Babel will do its thing, create the lib output directory for you, and write the ES5  version of index.js to it. The result in lib index.js will look something like Listing 1-3.  LISTING 1-3:  ES2015 transpiling example output—index-transpiled-to-es5.js  "use strict";   var obj = {   rex:  \d ,   checkArray: function checkArray array  {     var _this = this;       return array.some function  entry  {       return _this.rex.test entry ;     } ;   } }; console.log obj.checkArray ["no", "digits", "in", "this", "array"]  ;    false   console.log obj.checkArray ["this", "array", "has", "1", "digit"]  ;    true  If you compare src index.js  Listing 1-2  to lib index.js  Listing 1-3 , you’ll see only a couple  of changes  other than whitespace . First, Babel added a "use strict"; directive to the top of the  transpiled file  recall that strict mode is a feature added in ES5 that modifies the behavior of a couple  of things that were problematic for various reasons . This is Babel’s default, but it can be turned off if  you have code that relies on loose mode.  The interesting thing, though, is how it rewrote the arrow function. It created a variable within  checkArray called _this, set its value to this, and then used a traditional function as the some  callback; within the function, it used _this instead of this. That fits with my earlier description of    Review  ❘  15  arrow functions—that they close over this just like closing over a variable. Babel just made that hap- pen in a way an ES5 environment can understand.  This is obviously just a very small example, but it illustrates the point and gives you a taste of one  tool you might use if you need to do this in your projects. Babel can be integrated into your build  system, whether you use Gulp,28 Grunt,29 Webpack,30 Browserify,31 Rollup,32 or just about any other;  the installation page at https:  babeljs.io docs setup installation has instructions for all the  major ones.  REVIEW  JavaScript has changed enormously over the past several years, particularly 2015 onward. It will con- tinue to change in the future. But there’s no need to be concerned about getting overloaded with all  the new features; JavaScript will always be backward-compatible, so there’s no need to adopt a new  feature until unless you’re ready to do so and have need of it.  The new features run the gamut from small tweaks like allowing a trailing comma in a function call  arguments list and new convenience methods in the standard library, to major improvements like  declarative class syntax  Chapter 4 , async functions  Chapter 9 , and modules  Chapter 13 .  The people ultimately in charge of moving JavaScript forward are the members of TC39  Technical  Committee 39 of Ecma International , which is made up of JavaScript developers, programming lan- guage researchers, library and large website authors, representatives from major JavaScript engines,  and other stakeholders in JavaScript’s success and future. But anyone can get involved.  The process for new features is public and open. You can follow progress and stay up to date via vari- ous GitHub repositories, published meeting notes, and the TC39 Discourse group. Also, I continue  coverage where this book leaves off on the book’s site at https:  thenewtoys.dev.  Most of the features covered in this book are supported by the JavaScript engines in cutting-edge  browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, and by recent releases of engines in non-browser  environments like Node.js, Electron, React Native, etc.  Older environments like Internet Explorer can be supported via JavaScript-to-JavaScript compilation   aka “transpilation” , converting old-style code into new-style code, with tools  like Babel  that can  be integrated into your build system. Some features  like the Proxy objects you’ll learn about in Chap- ter 14  can’t be fully supported in this way, but many can.  Okay. The stage is set . . .

In this chapter you’ll learn how the new let and const declarations work and what problems  they solve. Throughout the chapter, you’ll see some behaviors of var that have proved prob- lematic, and you’ll learn how let and const solve those problems. You’ll see how let and  const provide true block scope and prevent confusion caused by repeated declarations or by  using a variable before you initialize it. You’ll discover how block scope means you can use let  to avoid the traditional “closures in loop” problem, and how const lets you create constants:  “variables” whose values cannot change. You’ll learn how let and const avoid creating even  more properties on the already-overburdened global object. In short, you’ll learn why let and  const are the new var, and why var no longer has a place in modern JavaScript programming.   18 ❘ CHAPTER 2    BLOCK-SCOPED DECLARATIONS: LET AND CONST    AN INTRODUCTION TO LET AND CONST   Like var ,  let  declares variables:      let x = 2;   x += 40;   console.log x ;    42      let a;     console.log a ;    undefined        You can use  let  anywhere you can use var . Just as with var , you don ’ t have to use an initializer with  let ; if you don ’ t, the variable ’ s value defaults to undefined :      That ’ s about where the similarities between  let  and  var  end. As you ’ ll learn throughout this chap- ter, other than those basic similarities,  var  and  let  behave quite differently. More on that later; let ’ s  look at const .   const  declares constants:      const value = Math.random  ;     console.log value < 0.5 ? "Heads" : "Tails" ;      Constants are just like variables, except their values can ’ t change. Because of that, you do need to  supply an initializer; constants have no default value. Other than creating constants instead of vari- ables and requiring an initializer,  const  is just like let . It ’ s also much more useful than you probably expect, as you ’ ll see across the course of this chapter.      TRUE BLOCK SCOPE  var  jumps out of blocks. If you declare a variable within a block using  var , it ’ s not just in scope  within that block, but outside it as well:      function jumpOut   {       var a = [1, 2, 3];       for  var i = 0; i < a.length; ++i  {             var value = a[i];             console.log value ;         }         console.log "Outside loop " + value ;     Why can we use 'value' here?     }     jumpOut  ;      The author of  jumpOut  probably didn ’ t mean for  value  to be accessible outside the loop, but it is.   So is  i .  Why is this a problem? There are a couple of reasons. First, variables should be scoped as narrowly as possible for maintainability reasons; they should only be around as long as you need them, and no longer. Second, any time the apparent intent of code and its actual effect differ, you ’ re asking for bugs and maintenance issues.    Repeated Declarations Are an Error  ❘  19  let and const solve this by having true block scope: they exist only within the block they’re declared  in. Here’s an example with let:  function stayContained   {     var a = [1, 2, 3];     for  var i = 0; i < a.length; ++i  {         let value = a[i];         console.log value ;     }     console.log "Outside loop" + value ;    ReferenceError: 'value' is not defined } stayContained  ;  Now, value is scoped to the block in which it appears. It doesn’t exist in the rest of the function. It’s  only around for as long as it’s needed, and the apparent intent matches the actual effect.   In stayContained, I didn’t change the other variables from var to let. That was just to highlight  the fact that what mattered was changing the declaration of value. Naturally, you can change the  others as well.   REPEATED DECLARATIONS ARE AN ERROR  var is happy to let you repeat yourself. You can declare the same variable with var as many times as  you like. For example:  function redundantRepetition   {     var x = "alpha";     console.log x ;        ...lots of code here...     var x = "bravo";     console.log x ;        ...lots of code here...     return x; } redundantRepetition  ;  That code is perfectly correct syntactically. The fact that it declares x more than once is completely  ignored by the JavaScript engine; it creates a single x variable that’s used throughout the function.  As with the var in a block earlier, though, the apparent intent of the code and its actual effect are at  odds with one another. Redeclaring a variable you’ve already declared is probably a mistake. In this  case, it’s likely that the original author of redundantRepetition didn’t have the middle bit there and  it was supposed to return "alpha"; but then someone else came along later and added a bit in the  middle, not realizing x was already in use.  Like many things, good programming practice  keeping functions short  and or lint tools and or  a good IDE can help here, which is great, but now so can JavaScript itself—let and const make  repeated declarations in the same scope an error:  function redundantRepetition   {     let x = "alpha";     console.log x ;        ...lots of code here...     let x = "bravo";        SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared   20  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt      console.log x ;        ...lots of code here...     return x; } redundantRepetition  ;  It’s the best kind of error, too: a proactive one. The error is raised when the code is parsed; it doesn’t  wait until later when you call redundantRepetition before telling you about the problem.  HOISTING AND THE TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE  var declarations are famously hoisted. With var, you can use a variable before you declare it:  function example   {     console.log answer ;     answer = 42;     console.log answer ;     var answer = 67; } example  ;  undefined 42  When you run example, it outputs the following:  We’ve cheerfully used the variable before it was declared, but the var declaration was seemingly  moved to the top of the function. And only the declaration moved, not the initializer attached to it   the = 67 part of var answer = 67 .  This happens because when entering the example function, the JavaScript engine scans through the  function handling var declarations and creating the necessary variables before it starts running any  of the step-by-step code; it “hoists”  lifts  the declarations to the top of the function. When it does  that, it initializes the variables they declare with a default value of undefined. But again, the appar- ent intent of the code and its actual effect are out of sync, which probably means there’s a bug here. It  looks like that first line is trying to assign to an answer variable that is in a containing scope  perhaps  even a global , but instead it uses a local. It also looks like the author intended that when answer was  created, it would start out with the value 67.  With let and const, you can’t use a variable until its declaration is processed in the step-by-step  execution of the code:  function boringOldLinearTime   {     answer = 42;               ReferenceError: 'answer' is not defined     console.log answer ;     let answer; } boringOldLinearTime  ;  Seemingly, the let declaration isn’t hoisted up to the top of the function like a var declaration is. But  that’s a popular misconception: let and const are hoisted, too. They’re just hoisted differently.   Hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone  ❘  21  Consider the observation earlier that the code may have been trying to assign to an answer in a con- taining scope. Let’s look at that scenario:  let answer;                    The outer 'answer' function hoisting   {     answer = 42;               ReferenceError: 'answer' is not defined     console.log answer ;     let answer;                The inner 'answer' } hoisting  ;  If the inner answer doesn’t exist until the let answer; statement at the end, then at the beginning of  the function where answer = 42; is, shouldn’t that line assign to the outer answer?  It could have been designed that way, yes; but how confusing would that be? Using an identifier for  one thing early in the scope but for something else later in the scope is asking for bugs.  Instead, let and const use a concept called the Temporal Dead Zone  TDZ , a period of time  within the code execution where the identifier can’t be used at all, not even to refer to something in a  containing scope. Just like with var, the JavaScript engine looks through the code for let and const  declarations and processes them before starting the step-by-step execution of the code. But instead of  making answer accessible and giving it the value undefined, the engine marks answer as “not yet  initialized”:  let answer;                    The outer 'answer' function notInitializedYet   {                                Reserve 'answer' here     answer = 42;               ReferenceError: 'answer' is not defined     console.log answer ;     let answer;                The inner 'answer' } notInitializedYet  ;  The TDZ starts when code execution enters the scope where the declaration appears and contin- ues until the declaration is run  along with any initializer attached to it . In this example, the inner  answer is reserved at the beginning of notInitializedYet  that’s where the TDZ starts  and initial- ized where the declaration is  that’s where the TDZ ends . So let and const are still hoisted, they’re  just hoisted differently than var is.  It’s important to understand that the TDZ is temporal  related to time , not spatial  related to space  location . It’s not a section at the top of the scope where the identifier can’t be used. It’s a period of  time during which the identifier can’t be used. Run the code in Listing 2-1.  LISTING 2-1:  Example of the temporal nature of the TDZ—tdz-is-temporal.js  function temporalExample   {     const f =    => {         console.log value ;     };     let value = 42;     f  ; } temporalExample  ;   22  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  If the TDZ were spatial, if it were a block of code at the top of temporalExample where value  couldn’t be used, that code wouldn’t work. But the TDZ is temporal, and by the time f uses value,  the declaration has been run, so there’s no problem. If you swapped the last two lines of that func- tion, moving the f  ; line above the let value = 42; line, then it would fail because f would try  to use value before it was initialized.  Try it!   The TDZ applies to blocks just as much as it applies to functions:  function blockExample str  {     let p = "prefix";                   The outer 'p' declaration     if  str  {         p = p.toUpperCase  ;            ReferenceError: 'p' is not defined         str = str.toUpperCase  ;         let p = str.indexOf "X" ;       The inner 'p' declaration         if  p != -1  {             str = str.substring 0, p ;         }     }     return p + str; }  You can’t use p in that first line inside the block, because even though it’s declared in the function,  there’s a shadowing declaration inside the block taking ownership of the p identifier. So the identi- fier can only refer to the new inner p, and only after the let declaration has been run. This prevents  confusion about which p the code is using.  A NEW KIND OF GLOBAL  When you use var at global scope, it creates a global variable. In ES5 and earlier, all global variables  were also properties of the global object. But that changed with ES2015: now JavaScript has tradi- tional globals created with var  which are also properties of the global object  and also new-style  globals  which are not properties of the global object . let and const at global scope create this new  kind of global.  ACCESSING THE GLOBAL OBJECT   You’ll recall that there’s one global object, and you can get access to it via this at  global scope, or by using a global that the environment defines for it  if any  such as  window or self on browsers or global on Node.js.  In some environments, such as  browsers, it’s not really the global object, it’s a facade on the global object, but that’s  close enough.   Here’s an example of using var to create a global that is also a property of the global object; note  that you must run this at global scope  if you’re using Node.js or jsFiddle.net, remember to make sure  you’re working at global scope, not module or function scope, as described in Chapter 1 .  var answer = 42; console.log "answer == " + answer ; console.log "this.answer == " + this.answer ; console.log "has property? " +  "answer" in this  ;   A New Kind of Global  ❘  23  When you run that, you’ll see:  answer == 42 this.answer == 42 has property? true  Now try it with let  in a fresh window :  let answer = 42; console.log "answer == " + answer ; console.log "this.answer == " + this.answer ; console.log "has property? " +  "answer" in this  ;  This time, you get:  answer == 42 this.answer == undefined has property? false  Notice that answer isn’t a property on the global object anymore.  It’s the same with const: it creates a global, but the global isn’t a property of the global object.  These globals are still accessible anywhere, even if they aren’t properties of the global object, so this  doesn’t mean you should stop avoiding globals. Given that, can you think of some reasons that hav- ing them not be properties of the global object is useful?  There are at least a couple of reasons:  ➤➤ The global object is already dramatically overburdened with properties in the most common   environment: a web browser. Not only do all var-declared globals end up on it, but it also  gets properties for all elements with an id, most elements with a name, and many other  “automatic globals.” It’s just overcrowded. Stemming the tide is a good thing.  ➤➤ It makes them harder to discover from other code. To use a let or const global, you have to   know its name; you can’t discover it by looking at the names of the properties in the global  object. This isn’t all that useful—if you want privacy, don’t create a global—but it’s slightly  less of an information leak.  ➤➤ It may make it possible for the JavaScript engine to optimize access to them  particularly   consts  in ways that can’t be applied to properties of the global object.  Speaking of automatic globals, a global declared with let or const  or class  shadows an automatic  global  that is, it hides it; the let or const declaration “wins” ; a global declared with var doesn’t in  all cases. The classic example is trying to use a global called name on a web browser. On a browser,  the global object is the Window object for the page, which has a property called name, which cannot  be shadowed with a var global and whose value is always a string:  A let or const global will successfully shadow it, though, or any other automatic global    window property:     On a browser at global scope var name = 42; console.log typeof name ;    "string"     On a browser at global scope let name = 42; console.log typeof name ;    "number"   24  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  Principally, though, decoupling let and const from the global object is just part and parcel of the  direction of the language as it moves away from relying on the global object—something you’ll learn  more about in subsequent chapters, particularly Chapter 13  Modules .  CONST: CONSTANTS FOR JAVASCRIPT  We’ve already covered several things about const that it shares with let; this section covers  const in depth.  const Basics  As you know, const creates a constant:  const answer = 42; console.log answer ;    42  It’s exactly like creating a variable with let, with all the same scope rules, the Temporal Dead Zone,  etc., except that you cannot assign a new value to a constant, whereas of course you can assign a new  value to a variable.  What do you think happens when you try to assign a new value to a constant? What would be the  most useful thing?  Right—you get an error:  const answer = 42; console.log answer ;    42 answer = 67;            TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'answer'  NOTE  The text of the error message varies from implementation to implementa- tion, but it will be a TypeError. As of this writing, at least one implementation  amusingly and oxymoronically says “TypeError: Assignment to constant vari- able”.  At first glance, it may seem that you’d only want to use const for things like avoiding having “magic  numbers” in code, such as a standard delay you might use in code before showing a busy message  when you’re doing something the user initiated:  const BUSY_DISPLAY_DELAY = 300;    milliseconds  But const is useful for far more than that. Although we frequently do change the values of variables,  we just as frequently don’t change their values; we just use them to hold unchanging information.  Let’s look at a real-world example: Listing 2-2 has a simple loop for appending text to divs depending  on whether they have a particular class. It seems to make fairly straightforward use of variables.   const: Constants for JavaScript  ❘  25  LISTING 2-2:  ES5 Version of div update loop—element-loop-es5.js  var list, n, element, text; list = document.querySelectorAll "div.foo" ; for  n = 0; n < list.length; ++n  {     element = list[n];     text = element.classList.contains "bar"  ? " [bar]" : "[not bar]";     element.appendChild document.createTextNode text  ; }  There are four variables in that code. If you look closely, you’ll see that one of them isn’t like the  other three. Can you spot what’s different?  One of them has a value that never changes: list. The others  n, element, and text  are actually  variables, but list is a constant.  We’ll come back to that code in a later section after covering a couple more aspects of const, but in  the back of your mind in the meantime, consider how you might apply let and const to that code   without removing any of the identifiers  based on what you know so far.  Objects Referenced by a const Are Still Mutable  It’s important to remember what it is that can’t be changed with a constant: the value of the constant.  If that value is an object reference, it doesn’t in any way mean that the object is immutable  that its  state can’t be changed ; the object is still mutable  it can still be changed . It just means you can’t  make the constant point to a different object  because that would change the value of the constant .  Let’s explore that:  const obj = {     value: "before" }; console.log obj.value ;          "before"  So far, you have a reference to an object in a  constant. In memory, you have something like  Figure 2-1.  The obj constant doesn’t directly con- tain the object, it contains a reference to the  object  shown in Figure 2-1 as “Ref55462” but of  course that’s just conceptual; you never see the real  value of object references . So if you change the object’s state:  FIGURE 2-1     obj:[Ref55462]   Object   value: "before"  obj.value = "after"; console.log obj.value ;          "after"  you’re not changing the value of the obj constant; it’s  still a reference to the same object  “Ref55462” . It’s  just that the object’s state has been updated so it stores a  different value for its value property; see Figure 2-2.  obj:[Ref55462]   Object   value: "after"  FIGURE 2-2      26  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  What const does is prevent you changing the actual value of obj, either to make it refer to a differ- ent object, or to set it to null, or something else entirely:  obj = {};    TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'obj'  Here’s a practical example, a function that adds a paragraph with the given HTML to a par- ent element:  function addParagraph parent, html  {     const p = document.createElement "p" ;     p.innerHTML = html;     parent.appendChild p ;     return p; }  Since the code only changes the state of the paragraph  by setting its innerHTML property , not which  paragraph p refers to, you can make p constant.  BLOCK SCOPE IN LOOPS  You saw block scope earlier in this chapter. On the face of it, it’s quite simple—a variable declared  with let or const inside a block is only accessible within the block:  function anotherBlockExample str  {     if  str  {         let index = str.indexOf "X" ;       'index' only exists within the block         if  index != -1  {             str = str.substring 0, index ;         }     }        Can't use 'index' here, it's out of scope     return str; } anotherBlockExample  ;  But what if the block is attached to a loop? Do all loop iterations use the same variable? Or are there  separate variables created for each iteration? How do closures created within the loop behave?  The people designing block scope for JavaScript did the clever thing: each loop iteration gets its own  block variables, in almost exactly the same way that different calls to a function each get their own  local variables. This means you can use block scope to solve the classic “closures in loops” problem.  The “Closures in Loops” Problem  You’re probably familiar with the “closures in loops” problem, though perhaps not by that name; run  the code in Listing 2-3 to see the problem in action.   Block Scope in Loops  ❘  27  LISTING 2-3:  Closures in loops problem—closures-in-loops-problem.js  function closuresInLoopsProblem   {     for  var counter = 1; counter <= 3; ++counter  {         setTimeout function   {             console.log counter ;         }, 10 ;     } } closuresInLoopsProblem  ;   Ignore any features setTimeout may have to help us with this problem; it’s just a placeholder for  any asynchronous operation.   You might expect that code to output 1, then 2, then 3, but instead it outputs 4, 4, 4. The reason is  that each timer doesn’t run its callback until after the loop finishes. By the time they call the call- backs, counter’s value is 4, and because it’s declared with var, counter is defined throughout the  closuresInLoopsProblem function. All three timer callbacks close over the same counter variable,  so they all see the value 4.  In ES5 and earlier, the usual way to solve that is by introducing another function and passing counter   into it as an argument, then using that argument instead of counter in the console.log. Coders   frequently do it with an inline anonymous function they call immediately, such as in Listing 2-4.  LISTING 2-4:  Closures in loops, standard ES5 solution—closures-in-loops-es5.js  function closuresInLoopsES5   {     for  var counter = 1; counter <= 3; ++counter  {          function value  {          The beginning of the anonymous function             setTimeout function   {                 console.log value ;             }, 10 ;         }  counter ;                The end of it, and the call to it     } } closuresInLoopsES5  ;  When you run that, it outputs the expected 1, 2, 3, because the timer functions are using value, not  counter, and each call to the anonymous wrapper function gets its own value parameter for the  timer function to close over. Nothing changes any of those value parameters, so the callbacks log the  expected values  1, 2, and 3 .  Thanks to ES2015’s let, though, you can solve it much more simply: by just changing var to let.  Run the code in Listing 2-5.   28  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  LISTING 2-5:  Closures in loops, solved with let—closures-in-loops-with-let.js  function closuresInLoopsWithLet   {     for  let counter = 1; counter <= 3; ++counter  {         setTimeout function   {             console.log counter ;         }, 10 ;     } } closuresInLoopsWithLet  ;  Running that also gives you the expected 1, 2, 3. One small change, one massive impact. But how  does it work? Surely the functions still close over counter? How can they all see different values?  Just like the calls to the anonymous function created multiple value parameters for the timer func- tions to close over, the loop above in Listing 2-5 creates multiple counter variables for the timer  functions created in the loop to close over, one for each loop iteration. So each iteration gets its own  counter variable.  To understand how, we need to look more closely at how variables  and constants  work in Java- Script. This will also help you with some later chapters.  Bindings: How Variables, Constants, and Other Identifiers Work  Earlier in this chapter you learned that const’s constants work just like let’s variables in terms of  scope, the kinds of values they can hold, etc. There’s a good reason for that. Under the covers, vari- ables and constants are the same thing, which the specification calls bindings  specifically in this case,  identifier bindings : a link between an identifier and the storage for its value. When you create a vari- able, for instance with  let x = 42;  you’re creating a binding for the identifier named x and storing the value 42 in that binding’s stor- age slot. In that case, it’s a mutable binding  a binding whose value can change . When you create a  constant, you create an immutable binding  a binding whose value cannot change .  Identifier bindings have names and values. Sound like  anything you know? They’re a bit like object properties  aren’t they? And like object properties, they’re in a con- tainer, which I’m going to call an environment object.1 For  instance, the environment object for the context where this  code runs:  let a = 1; const b = 2;  would look something like Figure 2-3.  Environment Object Environment Object Name: "a" Name: "a" Value: 1 Value: 1 Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: true Mutable: true  Bindings: Bindings:  Name: "b" Name: "b" Value: 2 Value: 2 Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: false Mutable: false  To handle nested scopes, environment objects are linked  together in a chain: each has a link to the one “outside” it.   FIGURE 2-3     1  What I’m calling an “environment object” is divided in the specification into a Lexical Environment and the Environ- ment Record it contains. The division isn’t important here.   Block Scope in Loops  ❘  29  If code needs an identifier that isn’t in the current environment object, it follows the link to the outer  environment object to find it  repeating as necessary, up through the global environment—which is  how global variables work .  The outer environment is set in various ways. For instance, when code execution enters a block with  block-scoped identifiers in it, the environment object for the block gets the environment object for the  code containing the block as its outer environment. When a function is called, the environment object  for the call gets the environment where the function was created  which is saved on the function; the  spec calls it the [[Environment]] internal slot of the function  as its outer environment. That’s how  closures work.  For instance, consider this code  assume it’s at global scope :  let x = 1; function example   {     const y = 2;     return function   {         let z = 3;         console.log z, y, x ;     }; } const f = example  ; f  ;  Within the f   call, when code execution gets to the console.log line, the environment object chain  looks something like Figure 2-4  overleaf .  Let’s follow that through:  x, f, and example to it.  ➤➤ The JavaScript engine creates the global environment  EnvObject1  and adds the bindings    ➤➤ It creates the example function, setting example’s saved environment link to the current   environment  the global one, EnvObject1 , and setting the example binding’s value to  the function.  ➤➤ It runs the let x = 1; line, setting x to 1. ➤➤ It runs the const f = example  ; line:  ➤➤ It creates a new environment object for the call  EnvObject2 , setting its outer envi-  ronment to example’s saved environment  EnvObject1 . ➤➤ It creates a binding called y in that environment object. ➤➤ It runs the const y = 2; line, setting y to 2. ➤➤ It creates the function, setting the current environment  EnvObject2, the one for the   call to example  as its saved environment.  ➤➤ It returns the function from the call. ➤➤ It assigns the function to f.   30  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  ➤➤ Finally, the engine runs the f  ; line, calling the function f refers to:  ➤➤ It creates a new environment object for the call  EnvObject3 , setting its outer envi- ronment to the function’s saved environment  EnvObject2, the one from the call to  example earlier , and creating the z binding on it.  ➤➤ It sets z to 3. ➤➤ It runs the console.log line.  EnvObject1 EnvObject1  Outer environment:  Global Environment  Outer environment:  Global Environment   Bindings  3 : Bindings  3 :  Name: "x" Name: "x" Value: 1 Value: 1 Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: true Mutable: true  Name: "f" Name: "f" Value:  function  Value:  function  Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: false Mutable: false  Name: "example" Name: "example" Value:  function  Value:  function  Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: true Mutable: true  EnvObject2 EnvObject2 Outer environment:  EnvObject1  Outer environment:  EnvObject1   Bindings  1 : Bindings  1 :  Name: "y" Name: "y" Value: 2 Value: 2 Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: false Mutable: false  EnvObject3 EnvObject3 Outer environment:  EnvObject2  Outer environment:  EnvObject2   Current environment object Current environment object for console.log z, y, x ; for console.log z, y, x ;  Bindings  1 : Bindings  1 :  Name: "z" Name: "z" Value: 3 Value: 3 Type: identifier Type: identifier Mutable: true Mutable: true  FIGURE 2-4     In the console.log line, the engine finds z in the current environment, but has to go to the outer  environment  the one for the call to example to find y, and has to go two levels out to find x.  How does all this help us understand closuresInLoopsWithLet? Let’s look at that function again;  see Listing 2-6.   Block Scope in Loops  ❘  31  LISTING 2-6:  Closures in loops, solved with let  again —closures-in-loops-with-let.js  function closuresInLoopsWithLet   {     for  let counter = 1; counter <= 3; ++counter  {         setTimeout function   {             console.log counter ;         }, 10 ;     } } closuresInLoopsWithLet  ;  When executing the for loop, the JavaScript engine creates a new environment object for each loop  iteration, each with its own, separate counter variable, so each timer callback closes over a different  counter variable. Here’s what the JavaScript engine does with that loop:  1.  2.   3.   4.   5.   It creates an environment object for the call; let’s call it CallEnvObject.  It sets CallEnvObject’s outer environment reference to the saved environment on the  closuresInLoopsWithLet function  the one where it was created; in this case, the global  environment .  It begins processing the for by remembering the list of variables declared with let in the  initialization part of the for; in this case, there’s just one, counter, though you could  have more.  It creates a new environment object for the initialization part of the loop, using CallEnv- Object as its outer environment, and creates a binding on it for counter with the value 1.  It creates a new environment object  LoopEnvObject1  for the first iteration, using Call- EnvObject as its outer environment object.  6.  Referring to its list from Step 3, it creates a binding for counter on LoopEnvObject1, setting   its value to 1  the value from the initialization environment object .  It sets LoopEnvObject1 as the current environment object.  7.  8.  Because the test counter <= 3 is true, it executes the body of the for by creating the first  timer function  let’s call it timerFunction1 , giving it a reference to LoopEnvObject1 as its  saved environment object.  9.   It calls setTimeout passing a reference to timerFunction1 into it.  At this point, you have something like Figure 2-5 in memory.  timer55461 timer55461  callback callback interval: 10 interval: 10 ... ...

It creates a new environment object  LoopEnvObject2  using CallEnvObject as its outer  environment.    11.  Using its list of bindings from Step 3, it creates a binding for counter on LoopEnvObject2   and sets its value to the current value of counter on LoopEnvObject1  1, in this case .    12.    13.     14.   It sets LoopEnvObject2 as the current environment object.  It does the “increment” part of the for loop: ++counter. The counter it increments is the  one in the current environment object, LoopEnvObject2. Since its value is 1, it becomes 2.  It continues with the for loop: since the condition is true, it executes the loop body by  creating the second timer function  timerFunction2 , giving it a reference to  LoopEnvObject2 so it closes over the information in it.    15.   It calls setTimeout passing in a reference to timerFunction2.  As you can see, the two timer functions close over different environment objects with different copies  of counter. The first one still has counter = 1; the second one has counter = 2.

When the timer functions are called by the timers, since they each use a separate environment object,  each with its own copy of counter, you see 1, 2, 3 instead of the 4, 4, 4 you saw with var where all  were sharing the same environment object and variable.  In short, the mechanics of block scope in the loop did exactly what our ES5 solution’s anonymous  function did: gave each timer function a different environment object to close over with its own copy  of the binding  counter in the let solution, value in the ES5 solution . But it did it more efficiently,  without requiring a separate function and function call.  Sometimes, of course, you want the old behavior. In that case, just declare the variable before the loop   which is, of course, what var did .

But the fact a block gets its own environ- ment object isn’t at all limited to for loops, and among other things that means while and do-while  loops also benefit from blocks getting their own environment objects. Let’s look at how.  while and do-while Loops  while and do-while also benefit from the fact blocks get their own environment objects. Since they  don’t have for’s initialization expression, they don’t do the thing where they copy forward the values  of the bindings declared there, but the block associated with each loop iteration still gets its own  environment. Let’s see that in action. Run Listing 2-7.  LISTING 2-7:  Closures in while loops—closures-in-while-loops.js  function closuresInWhileLoops   {     let outside = 1;     while  outside <= 3  {         let inside = outside;         setTimeout function   {             console.log "inside = " + inside + ", outside = " + outside ;         }, 10 ;         ++outside;     } } closuresInWhileLoops  ;   34  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  When you run closuresInWhileLoops, the output in the console is:  inside = 1, outside = 4 inside = 2, outside = 4 inside = 3, outside = 4  All of the timer functions close over a single outside variable  because it was declared outside the  loop , but they each close over their own inside variable.

You probably don’t care. Remember that premature optimization is just that: premature.   Worry about it if and when you have a real performance problem you’re solving.  2.  Yes and no. It is definitely more overhead if the JavaScript engine hasn’t optimized the dif- ference away, and there are times  including our closures in loops example  where it can’t  optimize the difference away. Other times, if we’re not creating closures or the engine can  determine that the closures don’t use the per-loop-iteration variables, it may well be able to  optimize the difference away. Modern engines do a lot of optimization. When ES2015’s let  was newish, Chrome’s V8 engine ran for loops markedly slower if you used let for the loop  variable than if you used var. That speed difference disappeared  for cases where closures  weren’t being created and such  as V8’s engineers found ways to optimize it.   Block Scope in Loops  ❘  35  If you run into an actual problem with a loop, and it’s not important that you have separate copies of  the variables, just move them into the enclosing scope:  let n; for  n = 0; n < aReallyReallyBigNumber; ++n  {        ... }  or if you don’t want it in that scope, wrap the entire loop in an anonymous block and declare the  variable in that block:  function wrappingInAnonymousBlock   {        ...some unrelated code...          Now we've identified a performance memory problem with the per-iteration        initialization of 'n', so we use an anonymous block to have just one 'n'     {         let n;         for  n = 0; n < aReallyReallyBigNumber; ++n  {                ...         }     }          ...more unrelated code... } wrappingInAnonymousBlock  ;  const in Loop Blocks  In the earlier section on const, you saw a simple div update loop  repeated in Listing 2-8  where one  of the variables  list  actually never changed, and I asked you to think about how you’d apply let  and const to the code  without removing any identifiers .  LISTING 2-8:  ES5 version of div update loop—element-loop-es5.js  var list, n, element, text; list = document.querySelectorAll "div.foo" ; for  n = 0; n < list.length; ++n  {     element = list[n];     text = element.classList.contains "bar"  ? " [bar]" : "[not bar]";     element.appendChild document.createTextNode text  ; }  Did you come up with something like Listing 2-9?  LISTING 2-9:  ES2015 version of div update loop—element-loop-es2015.js  const list = document.querySelectorAll "div.foo" ; for  let n = 0; n < list.length; ++n  {     const element = list[n];     const text = element.classList.contains "bar"  ? " [bar]" : "[not bar]";     element.appendChild document.createTextNode text  ; }   36  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  At the time, you may not have thought to move element and text into the for loop’s block, or if  you did you may have left them as let rather than const declarations. But their values within the  block never change, and of course each block gets its own copy of them, so they’re constants within  its scope and we can mark our intent just to use them, not modify them, by declaring them const.  You don’t have to declare something const just because you don’t change it. Whether you do is a  matter of style and something your team should discuss and come to agreement on  do use const,  don’t use const, or leave it up to individual style . There are pragmatic benefits to using it during  development  you get an early error if you try to change something a teammate declared const; you  then either purposefully change the declaration or don’t change the value of that constant , but your  team may be using full test suites that will also find the error  albeit somewhat later .  const in for-in Loops  In addition to the usual for loop with the four parts  initialization, test, increment, body , JavaScript  has other types of for loop: for-in, for-of, and for-await-of.  You’ll learn about for-of in   Chapter 6; for-await-of in Chapter 9.  Let’s take a quick look at a typical for-in:  var obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; for  var key in obj  {     console.log key + ": " + obj[key] ; }  If you were going to write that in ES2015+, would you use let or const for key?  You can use either. for-in loops with lexical declarations get a separate environment object for each  loop iteration just like while does. Since the code in the loop body doesn’t change key, it can be  const if you like:  const obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; for  const key in obj  {     console.log key + ": " + obj[key] ; }  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Here are some old habits that you may want to replace with new habits.  Use const or let Instead of var  Old habit: Using var.  New habit: Use const or let instead. The only remaining use cases for var are legacy code, for  instance having a top-level  var MyApp = MyApp  {};  in several scripts that may be loaded on a page and all write to different parts of the MyApp object,  and doing that is superseded by modules  see Chapter 13 .   Old Habits to New  ❘  37  If you adopt const for “variables” you don’t intend to change, you’ll probably find that you use  const much more than you originally thought you would, especially since with object references it  doesn’t mean you can’t change the state of the object, it just means you can’t change what object the  constant refers to. If you’re writing object-heavy code  which is almost inevitable with JavaScript , it’s  surprising how few actual variables you end up with.  Keep Variables Narrowly Scoped  Old habit: Listing vars at the top of the function, since that’s where var was hoisted to anyway.  New habit: Use let and const in the narrowest appropriate scope, where reasonable. This improves  the maintainability of the code.  Use Block Scope Instead of Inline Anonymous Functions Old habit: Using inline anonymous functions to solve the closures-with-loops problem:  for  var n = 0; n < 3; ++n  {      function value  {         setTimeout function   {             console.log value ;         }, 10 ;     }  n ; }  New habit: Use block scope instead:  for  let n = 0; n < 3; ++n  {     setTimeout function   {         console.log n ;     }, 10 ; }  Much cleaner and easier to read.  That said, don’t replace perfectly good named, reusable functions with block scope without  good reason:     If it's already like this, with a reusable named function, no need    to move the function code into the loop function delayedLog msg, delay  {     setTimeout function   {         console.log msg ;     }, delay ; }    ...later... for  let n = 0; n < 3; ++n  {     delayedLog n, 10 ; }   38  ❘  CHAPTER 2    Block-Scoped declarationS: let and conSt  Block scope isn’t a substitute for rightsizing functions, but it is a useful tool for eliminating confusing  inline anonymous ones.  If you use scoping functions at global scope to avoid creating global variables, you can even replace  those with a block  or a module, as you’ll learn in Chapter 13 . Blocks don’t have to be attached to a  flow-control statement like if or for; they can be free-standing. So your scoping function can just be  a scoping block:  {                            Scoping block     let answer = 42;         'answer' is local to the block, not global     console.log answer ; }   3  New Function Features  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ Arrow functions and lexical this, super, etc.  ➤➤ Default parameter values  ➤➤ “Rest” parameters  ➤➤ Trailing commas in parameter lists and function calls  ➤➤ The function name property  ➤➤ Function declarations inside blocks  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode   or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.

ARGUMENT  In programming, we have two closely related terms that are frequently used inter- changeably: parameter and argument. A function declares and uses parameters. You  call that function with specific values for those parameters called arguments. Let’s do  a quick example:  function foo bar  {     console.log bar * 6 ; } foo 7 ;  The function foo declares and uses a parameter named bar. The code calls foo with  the argument 7.  ARROW FUNCTIONS AND LEXICAL THIS, SUPER, ETC.  ES2015 added arrow functions to JavaScript. Arrow functions solve a whole class of problems,  particularly with callbacks: making sure that this inside the function is the same as this outside it.  They’re also lighter-weight and more concise than traditional functions created using the function  keyword  sometimes much more concise .  Let’s start with the syntax and then we’ll look more closely at this and the other things arrow func- tions handle differently from traditional functions.  Arrow Function Syntax  Arrow functions come in two forms: ones with a concise body  often called concise arrow functions   and ones with a standard function body  I call them verbose arrow functions, though they’re still not  as verbose as traditional functions . We’ll look at the concise form first.  Suppose you want to filter an array, keeping only the entries whose value is less than 30. You’d prob- ably do it by using Array.prototype.filter and passing in a callback function. In ES5, that would  look like this:  var array = [42, 67, 3, 23, 14]; var filtered = array.filter function entry  {     return entry < 30; } ; console.log filtered ;    [3, 23, 14]  This is a common use case for callbacks: a callback that needs to do something simple and return a  value. Arrow functions provide a very concise way to do it:  const array = [42, 67, 3, 23, 14]; const filtered = array.filter entry => entry < 30 ; console.log filtered ;    [3, 23, 14]   Arrow Functions and Lexical this, super, etc.  ❘  41  When you compare it to the traditional function you’re used to, it almost doesn’t look like a function  at all! Don’t worry, you’ll soon get used to it.  As you can see, the concise form of an arrow function is literally just the name of the parameter s  it  accepts, then an arrow  =>  to tell the parser this is an arrow function, and then an expression defin- ing the value it returns. That’s it. No function keyword, no curly braces to define a function body,  no return keyword; just the parameters, the arrow, and the body expression.  When you want an arrow function to accept multiple parameters, you need to wrap its parameter list  in parentheses to make it clear that they’re all parameters for the arrow function. For instance, if you  wanted to sort the array rather than filtering it, you’d do this:  const array = [42, 67, 3, 23, 14]; array.sort  a, b  => a - b ; console.log array ;    [3, 14, 23, 42, 67]  Consider how it would look if they weren’t there:  array.sort a, b => a - b ;  Notice the parentheses around the parameters. Why do you think the syntax had to require them?  See the problem? Right! It looks like we’re passing two arguments to the sort method: a variable  called a, and the arrow function b => a - b. So the parentheses are necessary if you have multi- ple parameters.  You can always include them, even if there’s only one parameter, if you like to be  consistent.   You also use parentheses when you don’t need to accept any parameters, such as in a timer callback— just leave them empty:  setTimeout    => console.log "timer fired" , 200 ;  Although concise arrow functions are frequently written without line breaks, that’s not at all a  requirement of the concise syntax; if you had a complex calculation to do in the array.sort call- back, you could put it on its own line:  const array = [42, 67, 3, 23, 14]; array.sort  a, b  =>     a % 2 ? b % 2 ? a - b : -1 : b % 2 ? 1 : a - b  ; console.log array ;    [3, 23, 67, 14, 42]  That code sorts the array in two groups: first the odd numbers and then the even ones. The body of  the function is still a single  complicated  expression, which is important for the concise arrow form.  But what if your arrow function needs to have multiple statements rather than just a single expres- sion? Maybe you think the sort call would be clearer if you broke up that complicated expression   I certainly think it would be . For that, you can use the function body form  or as I call it, verbose  form  by providing a function body using curly braces after the arrow:   42  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  const array = [42, 67, 3, 23, 14]; array.sort  a, b  => {     const aIsOdd = a % 2;     const bIsOdd = b % 2;     if  aIsOdd  {         return bIsOdd ? a - b : -1;     }     return bIsOdd ? 1 : a - b; } ; console.log array ;    [3, 23, 67, 14, 42]  That callback does exactly what the earlier one did, using multiple simple statements rather than a  single complex expression.  Two things to notice about the verbose form:  ➤➤ There’s an opening curly brace immediately after the arrow. That’s what tells the parser that   you’re using the verbose form, where the function body is inside curly braces just like with  traditional functions.  ➤➤ You use return to return a value, just like with a traditional function. If you didn’t use   return, then just like a traditional function, the arrow function wouldn’t explicitly provide  a return value and calling it would result in the value undefined.  Just as a concise arrow function doesn’t have to be on one line, a verbose one doesn’t have to be on  multiple lines. As is usually the case, where you do line breaks is up to you.  WARNING: THE COMMA OPERATOR AND ARROW FUNCTIONS  Because the concise form of an arrow function takes an expression after the =>,  some programmers have taken to using the comma operator to avoid using the  verbose form if they have just two or three things to do in the function. Recall that  the comma operator is one of JavaScript’s odder operators: it evaluates its left-hand  operand, throws away the resulting value, and then evaluates its right-hand operand  and takes that value as its result. Example:  function returnSecond a, b  {     return a, b; } console.log returnSecond 1, 2  ;    2  The result of return a, b; is the value of b.  How does this relate to arrow functions? It lets you do more than one thing in the  expression used by the concise form, by using an expression in the left-hand operand  that has a side effect. Let’s say you have an array of “handlers” wrapped around  “items,” and you want to transform each entry by passing the handler into an  unregister function, and then pass its item into a register function and remem- ber the result. With a traditional function you’d do this:  handlers = handlers.map function handler  {     unregister handler ;   Arrow Functions and Lexical this, super, etc.  ❘  43      return register handler.item ; } ;  You can make that shorter by using a verbose arrow function:  handlers = handlers.map handler => {     unregister handler ;     return register handler.item ; } ;  But some programmers will use a concise arrow function instead, using  or perhaps  abusing  the comma operator:  handlers = handlers.map handler =>        unregister handler , register handler.item     ;   But usually all on one line.  You have to put parentheses around the comma   expression  otherwise the parser would think you were passing two arguments to  handlers.map instead of one , so the only reason it’s shorter than the verbose form  is it avoids writing the return keyword.  Whether you consider this to be a handy use of the comma operator or an abuse of  it, just be aware that you are likely to see it used this way in the wild.  There’s one “gotcha” to be aware of with the concise form of arrow functions: a concise arrow func- tion returning an object created with an object literal.  Suppose you have an array of strings and you want to convert it into an array of objects using  the string as their name property. That sounds like a job for Array’s map method and a concise  arrow function:  const a = ["Joe", "Mohammed", "María"]; const b = a.map name => {name: name} ;           Doesn't work console.log b ;  But when you try to run that, you get an array with a bunch of undefineds in it instead of objects.   Or depending on the object you create, a syntax error.  What happened?  The issue is that the opening curly brace tells the JavaScript parser that you’re using the verbose form,  not the concise form, so it uses that brace to start the body and then uses the contents  name: name   as the body of the verbose arrow function, like this traditional function:  const a = ["Joe", "Mohammed", "María"]; const b = a.map function name  {                 Doesn't work     name: name } ; console.log b ;  Since the function doesn’t return anything  because the parser thinks you’re using the verbose form ,  the result of calling it is the value undefined, and you end up with an array filled with undefined.  The body of the function isn’t a syntax error  in this example  because it looks like a label  you  remember labels, the things you can use with nested loops to break the outer loop  followed by a free- standing reference to a variable. That’s valid syntax, although it doesn’t do anything.   44  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  The answer is to wrap the object literal in parentheses so that the parser doesn’t see a curly brace just  after the arrow, and knows you’re using the concise form:  const a = ["Joe", "Mohammed", "María"]; const b = a.map name =>  {name: name}  ;           Works console.log b ;  Or, of course, use the verbose form and return. Whatever seems clearest to you when writing it.  Brief tangent: the object literal in that call to map could be even shorter thanks to shorthand proper- ties, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 5.  Arrow Functions and Lexical this  So far, you’ve seen that arrow functions can make your code more concise. That’s useful just on its  own, but it’s not their main trick. Their main trick is that unlike traditional functions, they don’t have  their own version of this. Instead, they close over the this of the context where they’re created, just  like closing over a variable.  Why is that useful? Let’s take a familiar problem: you’re writing code in an object method, and you  want to use a callback, but you want this within the callback to refer to your object. With a tra- ditional function, it wouldn’t, because traditional functions have their own this that’s set by how  they’re called. Because of that, it’s common to use a variable the callback can close over as a worka- round, as in this ES5 code:  Thingy.prototype.delayedPrepAndShow = function   {     var self = this;     this.showTimer = setTimeout function   {         self.prep  ;         self.show  ;     }, this.showDelay ; };  Now you’re using the variable self instead of this inside the callback, so it doesn’t matter that the  callback has its own version of this with a different value.  Since arrow functions don’t have their own this, they close over this just like the ES5 example  closes over the variable self. So you can rewrite that callback as an arrow function without any need  for the self variable:  Thingy.prototype.delayedPrepAndShow = function   {     this.showTimer = setTimeout    => {         this.prep  ;         this.show  ;     }, this.showDelay ; };  Much simpler.  In Chapter 4 you’ll learn a new way to create that method, instead of assigning to a  Thingy.prototype property.   this isn’t the only thing that arrow functions close over. They also close over arguments  the auto- matic pseudo-array of all of the arguments the function received , and two other things you’ll learn  about in Chapter 4  super and new.target .   Default Parameter Values  ❘  45  Arrow Functions Cannot Be Constructors  Since they don’t have their own this, it stands to reason that arrow functions can’t be constructor  functions. That is, you can’t use them with new:  const Doomed =    => { }; const d = new Doomed  ;    TypeError: Doomed is not a constructor  After all, the primary purpose of a constructor function is to fill in the newly constructed object,  which is passed to the function as this. If the function doesn’t have its own this, it can’t set proper- ties on the new object, and it doesn’t make sense for it to be a constructor. Using them as constructors  is explicitly disallowed.  Explicitly disallowing it made it possible for arrow functions to be lighter-weight than traditional  functions, because they don’t have to have a prototype property on them with an object attached to  it. You’ll recall that when you use a function as a constructor, the prototype of the new object that’s  created is assigned from the function’s prototype:  function Thingy   { } var t = new Thingy  ; console.log Object.getPrototypeOf t  === Thingy.prototype ;    true  Since the JavaScript engine can’t know in advance whether you’re going to use a traditional function  as a constructor, it has to put the prototype property and an object for it to refer to on every tradi- tional function you create.  Subject to optimization, of course.   But since arrow functions can’t be constructors, they don’t get a prototype property:  function traditional   { } const arrow =    => { }; console.log "prototype" in traditional ;    true console.log "prototype" in arrow ;          false  Arrow functions aren’t the only new things about functions in modern JavaScript, though, not at all.  DEFAULT PARAMETER VALUES  As of ES2015, you can supply default values for parameters. In ES5 and earlier, you’d have to do it  with code, like this:  function animate type, duration  {     if  duration === undefined  {     Or any of several similar checks          duration = 300;     }        ...do the work... }  Now you can do it declaratively:  function animate type, duration = 300  {        ...do the work... }   46  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  This is more concise and easier for tools to support.  The default kicks in if the value of the parameter is undefined when the function is called. If you  leave the argument off entirely when calling the function, the parameter’s value is undefined. If you  supply undefined as the value, its value is also undefined  of course . Either way, the function uses  the default value instead.  Let’s see it in action: run the code in Listing 3-1.  LISTING 3-1:  Basic default parameters—basic-default-parameters.js  function animate type, duration = 300  {     console.log type + ", " + duration ; } animate "fadeout" ;               "fadeout, 300" animate "fadeout", undefined ;    "fadeout, 300"  again  animate "fadeout", 200 ;          "fadeout, 200"  The code to handle default values is effectively inserted at the beginning of the function by the Java- Script engine; however, that code is in its own scope as you’ll see later.  In that example, you could provide defaults for both type and duration if you liked:  And unlike some other languages, you can also provide a default for type but not for duration:  function animate type = "fadeout", duration = 300  {        ...do the work... }  function animate type = "fadeout", duration  {        ...do the work... }  That may seem a bit odd  arguably, it is a bit odd , but it goes back to the fact that the default is  applied if the value is undefined. That’s frequently because the argument wasn’t given, but it can also  be because undefined was given explicitly. Run the code in Listing 3-2.  LISTING 3-2:  Defaulting the first parameter—default-first-parameter.js  function animate type = "fadeout", duration  {     console.log type + ", " + duration ; } animate "fadeout", 300 ;       "fadeout, 300" animate undefined, 300 ;       "fadeout, 300"  again  animate "fadein",  300 ;       "fadein, 300" animate  ;                     "fadeout, undefined"  Defaults Are Expressions  A parameter default is an expression; it doesn’t have to be just a literal value. The default can even  call a function. The default expression is evaluated when the function is called, not when the function  is defined, and only if the default is needed for that particular call to the function.   Default Parameter Values  ❘  47  For instance, suppose you wanted to use a different duration for each type of animation, and you had  a function that gave you the default duration for a given type. You could write the animate function  like this:  function animate type, duration = getDefaultDuration type   {        ...do the work... }  getDefaultDuration isn’t called unless needed. That’s treated almost exactly like this:  function animate type, duration  {     if  duration === undefined  {         duration = getDefaultDuration type ;     }        ...do the work... }  The main difference relates to scope, which we’ll come to in a moment.  In that example, the default for duration uses the type parameter. That’s fine, because type comes  before duration. If type came after duration, it would be a ReferenceError if duration’s default  were needed for a particular call:  function animate duration = getDefaultDuration type , type  {        ...do the work... } animate undefined, "dissolve" ;    ReferenceError: type is not defined  This is just as though you’d tried to access the value of a variable declared with let before the let  declaration, as you saw in Chapter 2. From the JavaScript engine’s perspective, that function looks a  lot like this  again, other than scope :  function animate   {     let duration =  *...get the value of argument 0...* ;     if  duration === undefined  {         duration = getDefaultDuration type ;     }     let type =  *...get the value of argument 1...* ;        ...do the work... }  If you call it without a duration, the code filling in the default tries to use type when it’s in the Tem- poral Dead Zone, so you get an error.  The rule is simple: a default can use parameters listed before it, but not parameters listed after it.  Defaults Are Evaluated in Their Own Scope  As you’ve learned, defaults can refer to other parameters as long as they’re before the default in the  list, and they can refer to things that are part of the outer scope  like the getDefaultDuration func- tion in the earlier example . But they can’t refer to anything defined within the function body, not  even things that are hoisted. Run Listing 3-3.   48  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  LISTING 3-3:  Defaults can’t refer to things in the function body—default-access-body.js  function example value = x  {     var x = 42;     console.log value ; } example  ;    ReferenceError: x is not defined  I’ve used var there because it doesn’t have the Temporal Dead Zone; it’s hoisted to the top of the  scope where it’s declared. But the default value expression still couldn’t use it. The reason is that  defaults are evaluated in their own scope, which exists between the scope containing the function and  the scope inside the function  see Figure 3-1 . It’s as though the function were wrapped in another  function that handled doing the defaults, a bit like this:  Works, because x is in the Works, because x is in the outer scope  the parent outer scope  the parent scope of the parameter list scope of the parameter list scope . scope .  Works, because a is in the Works, because a is in the parameter list scope. parameter list scope.  Doesn’t work, because y isn’t Doesn’t work, because y isn’t in scope  it’s in the function in scope  it’s in the function body scope, which doesn’t body scope, which doesn’t exist yet.  exist yet.   Outer Scope Outer Scope  let x = 42;  Parameter List Scope Parameter List Scope  function example a = x, b = a, c = y  {   Function Body Scope Function Body Scope  var y = 67;  return a + b;  }  FIGURE 3-1     function example value  {     if  value === undefined  {         value = x;     }     const exampleImplementation =    => {         var x = 42;         console.log value ;     };     return exampleImplementation  ; } example  ;    ReferenceError: x is not defined  That’s not literally how it’s done, of course, but conceptually it’s very close.  Fortunately, just looking at a function with its parameter list, the pieces are visually distinct  the  parameter list is set apart from the function body , so it’s easy to understand the parameter list having  its own scope.   Default Parameter Values  ❘  49  NON-SIMPLE PARAMETER LISTS AND CHANGING STRICT MODE  A parameter list that’s just a bare list of parameters, without defaults or any of the  other ES2015+ parameter features you’ll learn about, is called a “simple” parameter  list. If a parameter list uses any of the new features, it’s called a “non-simple” param- eter list  creative, eh? .  Perhaps surprisingly, a function with a non-simple parameter list can’t have a "use  strict" directive:  function example answer = 42  {     "use strict";           SyntaxError: Illegal 'use strict' directive                             in function with non-simple parameter list     console.log answer ; }  Why is that an error? Because if that function is defined in loose mode code, the  directive would enable strict mode within the function. The problem with that is that  a non-simple parameter list effectively involves automatic processing  such a apply- ing defaults  that occurs within the parameter list. If a function definition appears  in loose mode but the function starts with "use strict", should the code in the  parameter list be in strict mode or loose mode? Consider this example:  function example callback = o => { with  o  { return answer; } }  {     "use strict";     console.log callback {answer: 42}  ; }  Should that be a syntax error  since with isn’t allowed in strict mode , or not? Is the  parameter list strict, or loose?  To avoid the confusion that question raises, the function isn’t allowed do that.  Moreover, to avoid parsing complexity, even if the function definition appears in  an already-strict context, it still can’t have a "use strict" directive if it has a  non-simple parameter list. It can only inherit the strictness of the context in which  it’s defined.  Defaults Don’t Add to the Arity of the Function  The arity of a function is typically defined as the number of formal declared parameters it has, which  in JavaScript you can get from the length property of the function:  function none   { } console.log none.length ;    0 function one a  { }   50  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  console.log one.length ;     1 function two a, b  { } console.log two.length ;     2  function stillOne a, b = 42  { } console.log stillOne.length ;       1 function oneYetAgain a, b = 42, c  { } console.log oneYetAgain.length ;    1  In JavaScript, parameters with default values don’t get counted when calculating the arity, and in fact  they prevent any subsequent parameters from being counted as well:  The result for the stillOne function is simple enough: it has one parameter without a default and  one with, so its arity is 1. The result for the oneYetAgain function is more interesting in that its  c parameter doesn’t have an explicit default, but because the parameter in front of it does, it isn’t  counted toward the arity.  “REST” PARAMETERS  Normally, when you write a function you know what parameters it will need and it will need the  same number of parameters on each call. But some functions need to accept a varying number of  parameters. For instance, before Object.assign was added in ES2015, many a JavaScript program- mer’s toolkit included an extend function accepting a target object and one or more source objects;  the function copies the properties from the source objects onto the target. In ES5 and earlier, you’d  use the arguments pseudo-array to access those arguments, like this:  function extend target  {     var n, source;     for  n = 1; n < arguments.length; ++n  {         source = arguments[n];         Object.keys source .forEach function key  {             target[key] = source[key];         } ;     }     return target; } var obj = extend {}, {a: 1}, {b: 2} ; console.log obj ;    {a: 1, b: 2}  But arguments has some issues:  ➤➤ In loose mode, it has performance problems caused by how it’s linked to the formal parame-  ters  but that can be addressed by using strict mode .  ➤➤ It has all of the arguments, meaning you have to index beyond the ones that are the same as   your formal parameters  which is why the extend example starts its for loop with n = 1  instead of n = 0; we want to skip the argument for the target parameter .   “Rest” Parameters  ❘  51  ➤➤ It’s array-like, but not an array, so it doesn’t have array features like forEach or map. ➤➤ Arrow functions don’t have their own arguments object. ➤➤ Subjectively speaking, it has a clunky name that doesn’t capture the function-specific   meaning of those arguments.  ES2015 added a solution to those problems: the “rest” parameter. If you declare the last parameter  with an ellipsis  ...  in front of it, that tells the JavaScript engine to gather up all of the actual   arguments from that point forward  the “rest” of the arguments  and put them in that parameter as a  genuine array.  If you update the earlier extend function to use a rest parameter, because that rest parameter’s  value is an actual array, you can use forEach  or for-of, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 6   instead of for:  Taking it further, extend itself could be an arrow function, since it doesn’t need its own arguments  pseudo-array anymore:  function extend target, ...sources  {     sources.forEach source => {         Object.keys source .forEach key => {             target[key] = source[key];         } ;     } ;     return target; } const obj = extend {}, {a: 1}, {b: 2} ; console.log obj ;    {a: 1, b: 2}  const extend =  target, ...sources  => {     sources.forEach source => {         Object.keys source .forEach key => {             target[key] = source[key];         } ;     } ;     return target; }; const obj = extend {}, {a: 1}, {b: 2} ; console.log obj ;    {a: 1, b: 2}  But what happens if there are no arguments supplied for the rest parameter at all? That is, what if we  call our extend function with just one argument, a target object, and no source objects at all?  Odd  as that would be to do.  What do you think the value of sources is then?  You probably inferred the answer from the implementation of the extends function: you get an  empty array, which is why that code didn’t need to check sources to be sure it had an array.  The  designers of this feature could have gone with having sources contain undefined in this case, but  they went with the empty array for consistency.   Note that ... is not an operator, although you’ll hear people calling it “the rest operator.” It’s just  “syntax” or “notation”  in this case, rest parameter syntax notation . You’ll learn more about ...  and why it isn’t an operator  and can’t be one  in Chapter 5.   52  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  TRAILING COMMAS IN PARAMETER LISTS AND  FUNCTION CALLS  Some coding styles list the parameters to the function on separate lines, perhaps to accommodate line  comments describing them or similar:  function example      question,       string  The question, must end with a question mark     answer          string  The answer, must end with appropriate punctuation   {        ... }  Similarly, when calling functions, it’s sometimes useful to put each argument on its own line, particu- larly if the argument is a long expression:  example      "Do you like building software?",     "Big time!"  ;  In both cases, as the codebase evolves and you need to add a third parameter to the function,  you have to add a comma to the previous line when adding the new line with the new param- eter argument:  function example      question,       string  The question, must end with a question mark     answer,         string  The answer, must end with appropriate punctuation     required        boolean  Coerced if necessary  so default is false    {        ... } example      "Do you like building software?",     "Big time!",     true  ;  Forgetting to do that is a common error, and needing to do it makes a code change unrelated to those  lines appear to involve those lines  for instance, in commit diffs , just because you added a comma.  ES2017 makes it possible to have a trailing comma at the end of parameter lists and argument lists.  As of ES2017, you can write the original two-parameter version of the function like this:  function example      question,       string  The question, must end with a question mark     answer,         string  The answer, must end with appropriate punctuation   {        ... }   The Function name Property  ❘  53  and call it like this:  example      "Do you like building software?",     "Big time!",  ;  This is purely a syntax change, it doesn’t change anything else. There isn’t some third unnamed  parameter or anything like that. The function with just question and answer still has just two  parameters; its arity, as reflected in its length property, is still 2.  Later when adding the third parameter, you just add the new lines; you don’t have to change the  existing ones:  function example      question,       string  The question, must end with a question mark     answer,         string  The answer, must end with appropriate punctuation     required,       boolean  Coerced if necessary  so default is false    {        ... } example      "Do you like building software?",     "Big time!",     true,  ;  THE FUNCTION NAME PROPERTY  ES2015 finally standardized the function name property  it was a nonstandard extension in some  JavaScript engines for years  and did so in a very interesting and powerful way that, among other  things, makes many functions that used to be anonymous no longer anonymous.  The obvious way that a function gets a name is through a function declaration or named function  expression:     Declaration function foo   { } console.log foo.name ;    "foo"    Named function expression const f = function bar   { }; console.log f.name ;      "bar"  let foo = function   { }; console.log foo.name ;    "foo"  Names are handy for reporting purposes, and particularly useful in call stacks on errors.  Interestingly, you can give a name to a function even if you use an anonymous function expression.  For instance, if you assign the result of the expression to a constant or variable:   54  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  This is not magic guesswork by the JavaScript engine. It’s clearly and carefully defined in the specifi- cation exactly when and where the names are set.  It doesn’t matter if you’re declaring the variable when you assign the function or if you assign the  function later; what matters is when you create the function:  let foo; foo = function   { }; console.log foo.name ;    "foo"  let foo =    => { }; console.log foo.name ;    "foo"  Arrow function expressions work just like anonymous function expressions:  It’s not just variable constant assignments, though; there are lots more places the name is derived  from context.  For example, in an object literal, if you assign an anonymous function expression’s result to a prop- erty, the function gets the name of the property:  const obj = {     foo: function   {     } }; console.log obj.foo.name ;    "foo"   It also works if you use the method syntax you’ll learn about in Chapter 5.   It even works when using a function as a default parameter value:   function callback = function   { }  {     console.log callback.name ;    "callback" }   ;  However, there is one operation that, perhaps surprisingly, does not set the function’s name—  assigning to an object property on an existing object. For example:  const obj = {}; obj.foo = function   { }; console.log obj.foo.name ;    "" - there's no name  Why not? TC39 considered this specific usage to be too much of an information leak. Suppose an  app has a cache of handlers keyed by some secret information related to a user and needs to pass the  handler to some external code. If it created the handler like this:  cache[getUserSecret user ] = function   {};  and the function name was set by that operation, giving out the handler function to third-party code  would give out the value from getUserSecret user . So the committee intentionally omitted that  particular operation from setting the function name.   Function Declarations in Blocks  ❘  55  FUNCTION DECLARATIONS IN BLOCKS  For years, putting a function declaration inside a block wasn’t covered by the specification, but it  wasn’t disallowed, either. JavaScript engines could handle them as an “allowable extension.” As of  ES2015, function declarations in blocks are part of the specification. There are standard rules for  them, and also “legacy web semantics” that only apply in loose mode on web browsers.  First, let’s look at what a function declaration in a block is:  function simple   {     if  someCondition  {         function doSomething   {         }         setInterval doSomething, 1000 ;     } } simple  ;  That has a function declaration  not a function expression  inside a block. But function declarations  are hoisted, processed prior to any step-by-step code. So what would a function declaration inside a  block even mean?  Since the syntax wasn’t specified but wasn’t disallowed, the makers of JavaScript engines were free to  define their own meaning for that syntax in their engines. Naturally, this led to problems, since dif- ferent engines did different things. The simple function earlier wasn’t particularly troublesome, but  consider this:  function branching num  {     console.log num ;     if  num < 0.5  {         function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         }     } else {         function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         }     }     doSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  function branching num  {     console.log num ;     var doSomething;     if  num < 0.5  {  In an ES5 world, there are at least three ways to handle that.  The first and most obvious option is: make it a syntax error.  The second option is to treat it as though the declarations were really function expressions, like this:   56  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features          doSomething = function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         };     } else {         doSomething = function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         };     }     doSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  function branching num  {     function doSomething   {         console.log "true" ;     }     function doSomething   {         console.log "false" ;     }     console.log num ;     if  Math.random   < 0.5  {     } else {     }     doSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  That ends up logging either “true” or “false” depending on the random number, which is likely what  the author intended.  The third option is to treat it like multiple hoisted declarations in the same scope:  That always logs “false”  because when you have repeated declarations in the same scope—which  you’re allowed to do—the last one wins . That probably isn’t what the author intended  in this  specific case , but is more in keeping with the fact that function declarations are hoisted rather than  being processed as part of the step-by-step code.  So what did JavaScript engine makers do?  All three.  Some engines  though—with a brief exception—mostly minor ones  went with option 1, others with  option 2, others with option 3. It was a mess.  When TC39 went to define semantics for function declarations in blocks, they had the very difficult  task of specifying something reasonable and consistent without invalidating significant code out in  the world. So they did two things:  ➤➤ They defined standard semantics that are in keeping with the rest of ES2015. ➤➤ They defined “legacy web semantics” for loose-mode code in web browsers only.   Function Declarations in Blocks  ❘  57  Function Declarations in Blocks: Standard Semantics  The simplest handling is the standard semantics, which are always in effect in strict mode  even on  web browsers . I suggest you use strict mode in order to avoid accidentally writing code relying  on legacy semantics. With standard semantics, function declarations are effectively converted into  function expressions assigned to let variables  so they’re scoped to the block they’re in , hoisted  to the top of the block. Let’s take the earlier branching function and add a bit more logging to see  the hoisting:  "use strict"; function branching num  {     console.log num ;     if  num < 0.5  {         console.log "true branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;         function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         }     } else {         console.log "false branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;         function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         }     }     doSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  In strict mode, the JavaScript engine treats that code as though it were like this:  "use strict"; function branching num  {     console.log num ;     if  num < 0.5  {         let doSomething = function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         };         console.log "true branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;     } else {         let doSomething = function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         };         console.log "false branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;     }     doSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  Notice how each declaration was effectively hoisted within its block, up above the console.log call.  Naturally, if you run that, it fails, because the doSomething at the very end is not a declared identifier  in the function’s top level scope, since the doSomething in each block is block-scoped. So let’s change  our example to something that will run, and run it; see Listing 3-4.   58  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  LISTING 3-4:  Function declaration in block: strict mode—func-decl-block-strict.js  "use strict"; function branching num  {     let f;     console.log num ;     if  num < 0.5  {         console.log "true branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;         f = doSomething;         function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         }     } else {         console.log "false branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;         f = doSomething;         function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         }     }     f  ; } branching Math.random   ;  Now, when you run it, f ends up referring to one function or the other, and either logs “true” or  “false.” Because of hoisting, doSomething refers to the function when it’s assigned to f, even though  that assignment is above the declaration.  Function Declarations in Blocks: Legacy Web Semantics  In loose mode on web browsers, legacy web semantics defined by Annex B of the specification apply.   Some engines apply them even outside web browsers.  The specification notes that, when not treat- ing function declarations in blocks as syntax errors, the different ways engines handled them meant  that only scenarios that were handled the same way by an intersection of those JavaScript engines  could be relied upon. Those three scenarios are:  1.  A function is declared and only referenced within a single block. 2.  A function is declared and possibly used within a single block but also referenced by an inner   function definition that is not contained within that same block.  3.  A function is declared and possibly used within a single block but also referenced within   subsequent blocks.  The example branching function we’ve used in this chapter doesn’t fit any of those three scenarios,  because it has two function declarations using the same name in two different blocks, and then refer- ences that name in code following those blocks. But if you have legacy loose-mode code matching  one of these three scenarios, you can expect it to work cross-browser. That doesn’t mean you should  write new code that relies on legacy web semantics. Instead, write code relying only on the standard  semantics  perhaps using strict mode to ensure that .   Function Declarations in Blocks  ❘  59  The legacy semantics are much the same as standard semantics, but in addition to the let vari- able within the block for the function declared in the block, there’s also a var variable for it in the  containing function’s scope  or global scope, if all of this isn’t inside a function . Unlike the let in the  block, the var’s assignment isn’t hoisted to the top of the block, it’s done when the function declara- tion is reached in the code.  This seems odd, but it’s to support case 2 of the intersection of behav- iors across major engines prior to standardization.   Again, the branching example doesn’t fit the list of common handling that legacy semantics are  meant to address, but legacy semantics do say how it’s meant to be handled now  whereas in older  engines it may not be handled this way : because there’s a doSomething var-style variable at func- tion scope, the doSomething call at the end works. Let’s look at the example again, without the "use  strict";, and with logging both before and after the function declarations. Load and run Listing 3-5.  LISTING 3-5:  Function declaration in block: web compatibility—func-decl-  block-web-compat.js  function branching num  {     console.log "num = " + num + ", typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;     if  num < 0.5  {         console.log "true branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;         function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         }         console.log "end of true block" ;     } else {         console.log "false branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof doSomething ;         function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         }         console.log "end of false block" ;     }     doSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  As you can see, this time the doSomething at the end isn’t out of scope. In loose mode, the JavaScript  engine treats that effectively like the following  except, of course, both varDoSomething and let- DoSomething are simply doSomething :  function branching num  {     var varDoSomething;     console.log "num = " + num + ", typeof doSomething = " + typeof varDoSomething ;     if  num < 0.5  {         let letDoSomething = function doSomething   {             console.log "true" ;         };         console.log "true branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof letDoSomething ;         varDoSomething = letDoSomething;    where the declaration was         console.log "end of true block" ;     } else {   60  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features          let letDoSomething = function doSomething   {             console.log "false" ;         };         console.log "false branch, typeof doSomething = " + typeof letDoSomething ;         varDoSomething = letDoSomething;    where the declaration was         console.log "end of false block" ;     }     varDoSomething  ; } branching Math.random   ;  Since the functions are assigned to a function-scope var variable, it’s accessible outside the blocks.  But the declarations are still hoisted within their blocks.  But again, it’s best not to write new code relying on these legacy semantics. Instead, the consistency of  strict mode is the way to go.  OLD HABITS TO NEW  With all of these new function features, there are a lot of old habits we can update.  Use Arrow Functions Instead of Various this Value Workarounds Old habit: Various workarounds for having access to the calling context’s this in a callback, such as:  ➤➤ Using a variable, e.g. var self = this; ➤➤ Using Function.prototype.bind ➤➤ Using the thisArg parameter of functions that support it  Examples:     Using a variable var self = this; this.entries.forEach function entry  {     if  entry.matches str   {         self.appendEntry entry ;     } } ;      Using Function.prototype.bind this.entries.forEach function entry  {     if  entry.matches str   {         this.appendEntry entry ;     } }.bind this  ;      Using 'thisArg' this.entries.forEach function entry  {   Old Habits to New  ❘  61      if  entry.matches str   {         this.appendEntry entry ;     } }, this ;  New habit: Use an arrow function:  this.entries.forEach entry => {     if  entry.matches str   {         this.appendEntry entry ;     } } ;  Use Arrow Functions for Callbacks When Not Using this  or arguments  Old habit: Using traditional functions for callbacks that don’t use this or arguments  because you  didn’t have a choice :  someArray.sort function a, b  {     return a - b; } ;  New habit: If the callback doesn’t use this or arguments, use an arrow function. Arrow functions  are lighter-weight and more concise:  someArray.sort  a, b  => a - b ;  The majority of array callbacks  such as on sort, forEach, map, reduce, . . . , callbacks on string  replace calls, promise creation and resolution callbacks  you’ll learn about promises in Chapter 8 ,  and many others can all usually be arrow functions.  Consider Arrow Functions Elsewhere As Well  Old habit: Using traditional functions for everything, because  again  you didn’t have a choice.  New habit: Consider whether using an arrow function makes sense even if it’s not a callback. This  will be primarily a matter of style. For example, look at this function, which produces an initial- capped string from an input string:  function initialCap str  {     return str.charAt 0 .toUpperCase   + str.substring 1 ; }  Compared with the arrow function version:  const initialCap = str =>     str.charAt 0 .toUpperCase   + str.substring 1 ;  In theory, the arrow function doesn’t have the cruft associated with the traditional function. Also,  you can use const as in that example to avoid the identifier being reassigned  or use let if you don’t  want to prevent that .   Traditional functions aren’t going anywhere, of course. Hoisting is sometimes useful, some prefer   having the function keyword flag up functions, and if brevity is your thing it’s worth noting   that even  62  ❘  CHAPTER 3    New FuNctioN Features  let x =    => {  *...*  };  is ever-so-slightly longer than  function x   {  *...*  }  although granted  let x=  =>{  *...*  };  is ever-so-slightly shorter.  It largely comes down to your style preference  and your team’s .  Don’t Use Arrow Functions When the Caller Needs to Control  the Value of this  Old habit: Using a traditional function as a callback where it’s important that the caller controls  what this is.  New habit: Um...keep doing that.  Sometimes, it’s important that the caller sets what this is. For instance, in browser code using  jQuery, you frequently want jQuery to control what this is in a callback. Or when responding to  DOM events that you’ve hooked up with addEventListener, because it will set this to refer to the  element when calling your callback  although you can use the event object’s currentTarget property  instead . Or when defining object methods that are shared between objects  for instance, because  they’re on the prototype , because it’s important to allow this to be set when they’re called.  So while switching to arrow functions is useful in some cases, sometimes an old traditional function   or the method syntax you'll learn about in Chapters 4 and 5  is what you want.  Use Default Parameter Values Rather Than Code  Providing Defaults  Old habit: Using code inside the function to provide a default for a parameter:  function doSomething delay  {     if  delay === undefined  {         delay = 300;     }        ... }  New habit: Where possible, use default parameter values instead:  function doSomething delay = 300  {        ... }   Old Habits to New  ❘  63  Use a Rest Parameter Instead of the arguments Keyword  Old habit: Using the arguments pseudo-array in functions accepting varying numbers of arguments.  New habit: Use a rest parameter.  Consider Trailing Commas if Warranted  Old habit: Not including a trailing comma in parameter lists and function calls  because they  weren’t allowed :  function example      question,       string  The question, must end with a question mark     answer          string  The answer, must end with appropriate punctuation   {        ... }    ... example      "Do you like building software?",     "Big time!"  ;  New habit: Depending on your style your team’s style, you could consider using trailing commas so  adding further parameters arguments as the code evolves doesn’t require changing the lines defining  what used to be the last parameter or argument:  function example      question,       string  The question, must end with a question mark     answer,         string  The answer, must end with appropriate punctuation   {        ... }    ... example      "Do you like building software?",     "Big time!",  ;  However, this is a matter of style.

In this chapter you’ll learn how class syntax works for creating JavaScript constructors and  associated prototype objects. We’ll compare and contrast the new syntax with the old, high- light that it’s still the same prototypical inheritance JavaScript is famous for, and explore how    66  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  powerful and simple the new syntax is. You’ll see how to create subclasses, including subclasses of  built-ins  even ones that can’t be subclassed in ES5 and earlier like Array and Error , how super  works, and what new.target is for and how to use it.  This chapter doesn’t cover features that are coming in ES2020 or ES2021 like public class fields,  private class fields, and private methods. See Chapter 18 for coverage of those.  WHAT IS A CLASS?  Before looking at the new syntax, let’s address the elephant in the room: JavaScript doesn’t really  have classes, does it? It just emulates them with prototypes, right?  That’s a popular perspective, because people confuse the kind of class provided by class-based  languages like Java or C with the general concept of a class in computer science terms. But classes  are more than just the largely static constructs those sorts of languages provide. In the more gen- eral sense, for a language to have classes it has to provide two things: encapsulation  bundling data  and methods together1  and inheritance. Having classes isn’t the same as being class-based, it’s just  that the language supports encapsulation and inheritance. Prototypical languages can  and do  have  classes and have since before JavaScript was invented; the mechanism they use to provide the second  requirement  inheritance  is prototype objects.  JavaScript has always been one of the most object-oriented languages you’ll find. It’s certainly been  able to do things in a class-like way since at least ECMAScript 1. Some might pedantically argue it  didn’t have classes in a computer science sense until ES5 added Object.create to directly support  inheritance  even though you could emulate Object.create with a helper function . Others might  argue even ES5 doesn’t qualify because it lacks declarative constructs and a simple way to refer to  superclass methods.  But the pedants can stop arguing. As of ES2015, even those objections are laid to rest: JavaScript  has classes.  Let’s see how they work in modern JavaScript. Along the way, we’ll compare the new syntax with the  old ES5 and earlier syntax.  INTRODUCING THE NEW CLASS SYNTAX  Listing 4-1 shows a basic example of class: a class whose instances are colors expressed in RGB.   The listing has some method body code omitted, because the goal here is just to show the over- all syntax. The method code is in the file in the downloads, which you can run, and it will be  shown later.   1  The term encapsulation can also refer to data hiding  private properties and such , but that isn’t necessary for a   language to have “classes.”  However, JavaScript does provide data hiding, via closures and via WeakMap, which   you’ll learn about in Chapter 12, and soon via private fields, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 18.    Introducing the New class Syntax  ❘  67  LISTING 4-1:  Basic class with class syntax—basic-class.js  class Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     }       get rgb   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     }       set rgb value  {            ...code shown later...     }       toString   {         return this.rgb;     }       static fromCSS css  {            ...code shown later...     } }   let c = new Color 30, 144, 255 ; console.log String c  ;              "rgb 30, 144, 255 " c = Color.fromCSS "00A" ; console.log String c  ;              "rgb 0, 0, 170 "  That defines a class with:  ➤➤ A constructor ➤➤ Three data properties  r, g, and b  ➤➤ An accessor property  rgb  ➤➤ A prototype method  toString   these are also sometimes called instance methods since   you usually access them through instances, but prototype method is more accurate; an  actual instance method would exist only on the instance rather than being inherited from  the prototype   ➤➤ A static method  fromCSS   these are also sometimes called class methods   The first thing to write is the class definition itself, which as you can see is a new structure. As with  functions, you define classes with either declarations or expressions:  Let’s build that up in parts.     Class declaration class Color { }     68  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes     Anonymous class expression let Color = class { };      Named class expression let C = class Color { };  We’ll stick with declarations for now and come back to expressions later.  Class declarations are not hoisted the way function declarations are; instead, they’re hoisted  or  half-hoisted  the way let and const declarations are, complete with the Temporal Dead Zone you  learned about in Chapter 2: only the identifier is hoisted, not the initialization of it. Also like let and  const, if you declare the class at global scope, the class’s identifier is a global but not a property of  the global object.  Adding a Constructor  Even with just what we have so far, the class has a default constructor, since we haven’t provided an  explicit one; more about that in a moment. For now, let’s add a constructor to the class that actually  does something. You define code for the constructor in a constructor definition, like this:  class Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     } }  This defines the function that will be associated with the class’s identifier, Color. Notice the syntax:  you don’t use the keyword function anywhere, just the name constructor, an opening parenthesis,  the parameter list if any  in this case, r, g, and b , a closing parenthesis, the curly braces to define the   constructor body, and the code for the constructor within those braces.  In real-world code, you  might validate the r, g, and b values; I’ve left that out of the example to keep it short.   NOTE  There’s no semicolon after the closing curly brace of the constructor  definition. Constructor and method definitions in a class body are like declara­ tions, which don’t have semicolons after them.  A semicolon is tolerated if pres­ ent, though; the grammar makes specific allowance for them to avoid making  this easy mistake a syntax error.   In ES5 and earlier, you probably would have defined that constructor like this:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent function Color r, g, b  {        ... }   Introducing the New class Syntax  ❘  69  but since class declarations aren’t hoisted like function declarations, those aren’t exactly equiva- lent; it’s more like a function expression assigned to a variable:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent var Color = function Color r, g, b  {        ... };  One thing to note here is how with class syntax, you write a structure for the class as a whole and  write the constructor definition separately within it, whereas with the old syntax you just defined a  function  and it was down to how you used that function whether it was just a function or the con- structor for a class . The new syntax is like that so you can define other aspects of the class declara­ tively, within the same container: the class construct.  As noted earlier, providing an explicit constructor is optional; the Color class would be perfectly  valid without one  other than not setting up its x, y, and z properties . If you don’t provide a con- structor, the JavaScript engine creates one for you that does nothing, exactly as though you had this  in the class:  constructor   { }   In subclasses it does something, as you’ll learn later.   The constructor is a function, but you can only call it as part of the object creation process: running  the constructor function must be the result of using new  either directly or indirectly by using new on  a subclass  or the result of calling Reflect.construct  which you’ll learn about in Chapter 14 . If  you try to call it when not creating an object, it throws an error:  Color  ;         TypeError: Class constructor Color cannot                  be invoked without 'new'  This addresses a whole range of bugs the old syntax didn’t, where a function meant to be a con- structor could also be called without new, leading to extremely confusing results  or bloated code to  prevent it .  Let’s add that “bloated code” to the ES5 Color example to make it  somewhat  disallow calls except  through new:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent var Color = function Color r, g, b  {     if  ! this instanceof Color   {         throw new TypeError              "Class constructor Color cannot be invoked without 'new'"          ;     }        ... };  That doesn’t actually force it to be called as part of the object construction process  you could just  call it via Color.call or Color.apply with a preexisting object , but it at least makes an attempt to.  You can see that already, even in a minimal class, you’re getting real advantages in terms of robust- ness from using the new syntax, while cutting down boilerplate code.   70  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  Code inside a class is always in strict mode, even if the surrounding code is not. So to be really  thorough with the ES5 example, we’d have to wrap all that in a scoping function and use strict mode  within it. But let’s just assume our code is already in strict mode rather than further complicating our  ES5 example.  Adding Instance Properties  At least for now, the standard way to set up properties on new instances of a class is to assign to them  in the constructor just like you do in ES5:  class Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     } }  Because those properties are created through basic assignment, they’re configurable, writable, and  enumerable.  Naturally, in addition to  or instead of  properties you get from parameters, you could set up a prop- erty that doesn’t come from a constructor argument, just using a literal or a value that comes from  somewhere else. If you wanted all Color instances to start out black, for instance, you could leave off  the r, g, and b parameters and just make the r, g, and b properties all start out with the value zero:  class Color {     constructor   {         this.r = 0;         this.g = 0;         this.b = 0;     } }  NOTE  In Chapter 18 you’ll learn about a feature that is likely to be in ES2020  or ES2021 but which is already widely used via transpilation: public class field   property  declarations.  Adding a Prototype Method  Now let’s add a method that will be put on the class’s prototype object so all instances have  access to it:  class Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     }     Introducing the New class Syntax  ❘  71      toString   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     } }  Note that there’s no comma between the constructor definition and the toString definition, as there  would be if they were in an object literal. A class definition isn’t like an object literal; you don’t sepa- rate things with commas.  If you do, you’ll get a syntax error.   The method syntax shown earlier puts the method on the Color.prototype object, so instances of  the class inherit that method from their prototype:  const c = new Color 30, 144, 255 ; console.log c.toString   ;               "rgb 30, 144, 255 "  Contrast the new syntax with how prototype functions are typically added in ES5:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent Color.prototype.toString = function toString   {     return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " "; };  The new syntax, ES2015’s method syntax, is more declarative and concise. It also marks the function  specifically as a method, which gives it access to features it wouldn’t have as a simple function  such  as super; you’ll learn about that later . The new syntax also makes the method non-enumerable, a  reasonable default for methods on prototypes, which the ES5 version shown earlier doesn’t.  To make  it non-enumerable in the ES5 code, you’d have to define it with Object.defineProperty instead of  using assignment.   A method is also, by definition, not a constructor function, and so the JavaScript engine doesn’t put a  prototype property and associated object on it:  class Color {        ...     toString   {            ...     } } const c = new Color 30, 144, 255 ; console.log typeof c.toString.prototype ;    "undefined"  Since methods aren’t constructors, trying to call them via new results in an error.  In contrast, in ES5, all functions might be used as constructors as far as the engine knows, and so it  has to give them a prototype property with an object attached:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent var Color = function Color r, g, b  {        ... }; Color.prototype.toString = function toString   {        ... }; var c = new Color 30, 144, 255 ; console.log typeof c.toString.prototype ;    "object"   72  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  In theory, then, method syntax is more memory-efficient than the older function syntax. In   practice, it wouldn’t be surprising if JavaScript engines were already able to optimize away   unneeded prototype properties even on ES5 methods.  Adding a Static Method  In building up the example Color class, so far you’ve seen a constructor, a couple of instance proper- ties, and a prototype method. Let’s add a static method, which is a method attached to Color itself  instead of to the prototype:  class Color {        ...       static fromCSS css  {         const match =  ^? [0-9a-f]{3}[0-9a-f]{6} ;?$ i.exec css ;         if  !match  {             throw new Error "Invalid CSS code: " + css ;         }         let vals = match[1];         if  vals.length === 3  {             vals = vals[0] + vals[0] + vals[1] + vals[1] + vals[2] + vals[2];         }         return new this              parseInt vals.substring 0, 2 , 16 ,             parseInt vals.substring 2, 4 , 16 ,             parseInt vals.substring 4, 6 , 16           ;     } }  NOTE  This particular static method, fromCSS, creates and returns a new in­ stance of the class. Obviously, not all static methods do that, but this one does.  The way it does so in this example is by calling new this  *...*  , which works  because when you call Color.fromCSS  *...*  , as usual this within the   call is set to the object the property was accessed on  Color in this case , so   new this  *...*   is the same as new Color  *...*  . Later, in the section on  subclassing, you’ll learn about an alternative you could use there if appropriate.  The static keyword tells the JavaScript engine to put that method on Color itself, not on   Color.prototype. You call it on Color directly:  const c = Color.fromCSS "1E90FF" ; console.log c.toString   ;              "rgb 30, 144, 255 "   Introducing the New class Syntax  ❘  73  Previously in ES5 you would have done this by assigning to a property on the Color function:  Color.fromCSS = function fromCSS css  {        ... };  As with prototype methods, using method syntax means that fromCSS doesn’t have a   prototype property with an object assigned to it, which that ES5 version would, and can’t be   called as a constructor.  Adding an Accessor Property  Let’s add an accessor property to the Color class. An accessor property is a property with a getter  method, setter method, or both. For Color, let’s provide an rgb property that gets the color as a  standard rgb r,g,b  string, and update the toString method to use that property instead of creat- ing the string itself:  class Color {        ...       get rgb   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     }       toString   {         return this.rgb;     } } let c = new Color 30, 144, 255 ; console.log c.rgb ;              "rgb 30, 144, 255 "  As you can see, this is just like defining an accessor in an object literal in ES5. There’s one small dif- ference in the result: accessor properties in class constructs are non-enumerable, which again makes  sense for something defined on a prototype, whereas accessor properties defined in object literals are  enumerable.  So far, Color’s rgb accessor is read-only  a getter with no setter . If you wanted to add a setter, you’d  define a set method as well:  class Color {        ...       get rgb   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     }       set rgb value  {         let s = String value ;         let match =  ^rgb\  \d{1,3} , \d{1,3} , \d{1,3} \ $ i.exec              s.replace  \s g, ""           ;   74  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes          if  !match  {             throw new Error "Invalid rgb color string '" + s + "'" ;         }         this.r = parseInt match[1], 10 ;         this.g = parseInt match[2], 10 ;         this.b = parseInt match[3], 10 ;     }          ... }  Now you can set rgb as well as getting it:  let c = new Color  ; console.log c.rgb ;              "rgb 0, 0, 0 " c.rgb = "rgb 30, 144, 255 "; console.log c.r ;                30 console.log c.g ;                144 console.log c.b ;                255 console.log c.rgb ;              "rgb 30, 144, 255 "  Defining an accessor in ES5 is a bit painful if you want to add it to the existing object on the   prototype property  rather than replacing that object with a new one :     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent Object.defineProperty Color.prototype, "rgb", {     get: function   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     },     set: function value  {            ...     },     configurable: true } ;  You can also define static accessor properties, though that’s likely to be a rare use case. Simply define  an accessor with static before it:  class StaticAccessorExample {     static get cappedClassName   {         return this.name.toUpperCase  ;     } } console.log StaticAccessorExample.cappedClassName ;    STATICACCESSOREXAMPLE  Computed Method Names  Sometimes, you want to create methods with names that are determined at runtime rather than  literally provided in the code. This is particularly important when using Symbols, which you’ll learn  about in Chapter 5. In ES5 it was easy enough to do that with brackets property accessor syntax:     Older  ~ES5  example var name = "foo" + Math.floor Math.random   * 1000 ; SomeClass.prototype[name] = function   {        ... };   Comparing with the Older Syntax  ❘  75  In ES2015, you can do much the same with method syntax:  let name = "foo" + Math.floor Math.random   * 1000 ; class SomeClass {     [name]   {            ...     } }  Note the square brackets around the method name. They work exactly the same way they do in a  property accessor:  ➤➤ You can put any expression inside them. ➤➤ The expression is evaluated when the class definition is evaluated. ➤➤ If the result isn’t a string or a Symbol  Chapter 5 , it’s converted to a string. ➤➤ The result is used as the method name.  Static methods and accessor property methods can have computed names as well. Here’s an example  of a static method that gets its name from the result of a multiplication expression:  class Guide {     static [6 * 7]   {         console.log "Life, the Universe, and Everything" ;     } } Guide["42"]  ;    "Life, the Universe, and Everything"  COMPARING WITH THE OLDER SYNTAX  Although you’ve already seen comparisons between the new syntax with the old along the way in this  chapter, let’s compare a complete Color class definition in ES2015 syntax with its near-equivalent  ES5 version.

Just  setting up inheritance of constructors in ES5 is fairly complex and error-prone; using the “super”  version of a method in a subclass is even more so. With the class syntax, all of that difficulty is  swept away.   78  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  Let’s create a subclass of Color called ColorWithAlpha,2 with an opacity property:  class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { }  Yes, that’s really all that you have to do to create a subclass. There’s more you can do and presumably  will do, but that’s all you have to do. That does the following things:  ➤➤ Creates the ColorWithAlpha subclass constructor. ➤➤ Makes Color  the superclass constructor function  ColorWithAlpha’s prototype so any   static properties methods on Color are accessible from ColorWithAlpha.  We’ll come back  to this; the idea of a function having a prototype other than Function.prototype is new  and may seem a bit surprising.   ➤➤ Creates the subclass prototype object, ColorWithAlpha.prototype. ➤➤ Makes Color.prototype that object’s prototype, so that objects created with new    ColorWithAlpha inherit the superclass properties and methods.  Figure 4-1 gives a picture of the Color ColorWithAlpha relationship. Note the two parallel lines  of inheritance: one line of inheritance for the constructor functions  ColorWithAlpha to Color to  Function.prototype to Object.prototype  and a parallel one for objects created with those con- structors  ColorWithAlpha.prototype to Color.prototype to Object.prototype .  ColorWithAlpha  Color  Function.prototype  Object.prototype  ColorWithAlpha.prototype  Color.prototype  Object.prototype  FIGURE 4-1   Run Listing 4-4 to see that the basics of the subclass are set up just by that simple declaration.  LISTING 4-4:  Class with basic subclass—class-and-basic-subclass.js  class Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     }       get rgb   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     }    2  Why “alpha”? ColorWithAlpha will use RGBA. In RGBA, the A is for “alpha,” referring to the “alpha channel” that  transparency information is stored transmitted in.   Creating Subclasses  ❘  79      set rgb value  {         let s = String value ;         let match =  ^rgb\  \d{1,3} , \d{1,3} , \d{1,3} \ $ i.exec              s.replace  \s g, ""           ;         if  !match  {             throw new Error "Invalid rgb color string '" + s + "'" ;         }         this.r = parseInt match[1], 10 ;         this.g = parseInt match[2], 10 ;         this.b = parseInt match[3], 10 ;     }       toString   {         return this.rgb;     }       static fromCSS css  {         const match =  ^? [0-9a-f]{3}[0-9a-f]{6} ;?$ i.exec css ;         if  !match  {             throw new Error "Invalid CSS code: " + css ;         }         let vals = match[1];         if  vals.length === 3  {             vals = vals[0] + vals[0] + vals[1] + vals[1] + vals[2] + vals[2];         }         return new this              parseInt vals.substring 0, 2 , 16 ,             parseInt vals.substring 2, 4 , 16 ,             parseInt vals.substring 4, 6 , 16           ;     } }   class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { }      Usage: const c = new ColorWithAlpha 30, 144, 255 ; console.log String c  ;    "rgb 30, 144, 255 "  Note that even though there’s no explicitly defined constructor in ColorWithAlpha, using it to  construct a color worked just fine. That’s because the JavaScript engine provided a default construc- tor. Instead of the “do nothing” default the engine provides for base classes, the default for subclasses  calls the superclass’s constructor, passing along all of the arguments it receives.  You may hear people  say that the subclass inherits the constructor, but it doesn’t; the engine creates a separate function that  calls the superclass constructor.  This is a very powerful default, meaning that in many cases, there’s  no need to supply an explicit constructor in subclasses.   80  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  NOTE  If you’ve worked in Java or C or similar, there’s a big difference   between JavaScript’s default constructor and the one that the Java or C   compiler would supply for you. In Java and C  and many related languages ,  the default constructor accepts no parameters and calls the superclass   constructor with no arguments:         Java     Subclass   {         super  ;     }        C     Subclass   : base   {     }  But in JavaScript, the default constructor for a subclass accepts any number of  arguments and passes all of them into the superclass constructor:         JavaScript     constructor  *...any number of parameters here...*   {         super  *...all are passed to super here...*  ;     }   You’ll learn about super in the next section.   This is a natural outgrowth of the fact that JavaScript doesn’t use function  overloading and function signatures the way Java and C do. In Java or C,  you could have multiple “overloaded” constructors, each accepting a different  number or types of parameters. In JavaScript, you have only one constructor,  and any variations in the parameter lists are handled within the constructor. It  simply makes more sense to have the default call the superclass with all argu­ ments it received rather than none, so that a subclass that doesn’t need to change  what the constructor expects can just leave the constructor off entirely.  To illustrate how the new syntax works, let’s take the subclass definition:  class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { }  and compare it with the near-equivalent in ES5 syntax:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent var ColorWithAlpha = function ColorWithAlpha   {     Color.apply this, arguments ; }; ColorWithAlpha.prototype = Object.create Color.prototype ; ColorWithAlpha.prototype.constructor = ColorWithAlpha;  That’s a fair bit of boilerplate code, with a lot of opportunity for error, just to set up a subclass, and  it doesn’t make Color’s static properties and methods available on ColorWithAlpha. It’s not terrible,  but it’s non-obvious and easy to get wrong. The new syntax is clearer, more declarative, offers more  functionality, and is easier to use.   Creating Subclasses  ❘  81  There’s not much point in creating a subclass, though, if we’re not going to make it do something  different from the superclass. Let’s add some features to ColorWithAlpha, for which you’ll need to  know about super.  The super Keyword  To add features to ColorWithAlpha, in many cases you’ll need to know about a new keyword: super.   You use super in constructors and methods to refer to aspects of the superclass. There are two ways  you can use it:  ➤➤ super  : In a subclass constructor, you call super as though it were a function to create the   object and have the superclass do its initialization of the object.  ➤➤ super.property and super.method  : You refer to properties and methods of the superclass   prototype by accessing them on super rather than on this.  Of course, you can use either  dot notation, super.property, or brackets notation, super["property"].   The next two sections go into the details of using super.  NOTE  super isn’t just for use in classes. In Chapter 5 you’ll see how super works  in methods on objects created with object literals instead of new.  Writing Subclass Constructors  ColorWithAlpha will need a property that Color doesn’t have: the opacity. Let’s give it a property  called a  “alpha”  to store it in. The a property will have values in the range 0 to 1  inclusive ; for  instance, the value 0.7 means the color is 70% opaque  30% transparent .  Since ColorWithAlpha needs to accept a fourth construction parameter, it can’t just use the default  constructor anymore. It needs its own:  class ColorWithAlpha extends Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, a = 1  {         super r, g, b ;         this.a = a;     } }  The first thing ColorWithAlpha does is call super, passing in the r, g, and b parameters. This cre- ates the object and lets Color do its initialization of the object. In ES5, the constructor might look  like this:     Older  ~ES5  near-equivalent var ColorWithAlpha = function ColorWithAlpha r, g, b, a  {     Color.call this, r, g, b ;     this.a = a; };   82  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  The Color.call this, r, g, b  is the near-equivalent of super r, g, b . But there’s a signifi- cant difference: in ES5, the object was created before the first line of ColorWithAlpha ran. You could  reverse the two lines in it if you wanted to  though it would be poor practice :  var ColorWithAlpha = function ColorWithAlpha r, g, b, a  {     this.a = a;                    Works even though it's before the call to Color     Color.call this, r, g, b ; };  That isn’t true with class. At the beginning of ColorWithAlpha’s code, the object hasn’t been cre- ated yet. If you try to use this, you’ll get an error. You can only use this once the object has been  created, and it isn’t created until you call super. Try running the code in Listing 4-5.  LISTING 4-5:  Accessing this before super—accessing-this-before-super.js  class Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     } }   class ColorWithAlpha extends Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, a = 1  {         this.a = a;                     ERROR HERE         super r, g, b ;     } }      Usage: const c = new ColorWithAlpha 30, 144, 255, 0.5 ;  The exact error you get will vary from JavaScript engine to JavaScript engine. Here are some   examples:  ➤➤ ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before access-  ing 'this' or returning from derived constructor  ➤➤ ReferenceError: must call super constructor before using this in    ColorWithAlpha class constructor  ➤➤ ReferenceError: this is not defined  This requirement is there to ensure that the initialization of the object being constructed is done from  the base upward. You can have code in your constructor prior to calling super, but it cannot use  this or anything else instance-specific until after the object has been created and the superclass has  had its chance to initialize the instance.  Not only is this off-limits until you call super, but you must call super at some point in a subclass  constructor. If you don’t, an error occurs when the constructor returns. Finally, unsurprisingly, trying  to call super twice is an error: you can’t create the object when it already exists!   Creating Subclasses  ❘  83  Inheriting and Accessing Superclass Prototype Properties  and Methods  Sometimes, a subclass overrides the definition of a method, providing its own instead of using the one  inherited from the superclass. For instance, ColorWithAlpha should have its own toString that uses  rgba notation and includes the a property:  With that in place, calling toString on a ColorWithAlpha instance will use that definition instead of  the one from Color.  Sometimes, though, the subclass method needs to call the superclass method as part of its implemen- tation. Obviously this.methodName   wouldn’t work, because it would just be calling itself; you  need to go up a level. To do that, you call the superclass method via super.methodName  .  Let’s look at that by adding a brightness method to Color that calculates the brightness  lumi- nance  of the color:  class ColorWithAlpha extends Color {        ...       toString   {         return "rgba " + this.r + ", " +                          this.g + ", " +                          this.b + ", " +                          this.a + " ";     } }  class Color {        ...       brightness   {         return Math.sqrt               this.r * this.r * 0.299  +              this.g * this.g * 0.587  +              this.b * this.b * 0.114           ;     } }  Without getting into the math  and this is just one definition of luminance; there are others , those  constants adjust the colors to allow for the fact that human eyes perceive the brightness of red, green,  and blue differently.  That definition of brightness works for Color, but not ColorWithAlpha, which needs to take its  opacity into account: at a minimum it needs to dim its brightness based on its transparency, and ide- ally it wants to know what background color will be behind it so it can account for the brightness of  that color, since the background color will partially show through. So ColorWithAlpha needs its own  version of brightness, like this:  class ColorWithAlpha extends Color {        ...     84  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes      brightness bgColor  {         let result = super.brightness   * this.a;         if  bgColor && this.a !== 1  {             result =  result +  bgColor.brightness   *  1 - this.a      2;         }         return result;     } }  It uses Color’s brightness to get the basic brightness of its color  super.brightness   , then  applies the opacity. If it was given a background color and the current color isn’t fully opaque, it  takes the background color’s brightness into account.

This way explicitly refers to Color  the superclass , which isn’t ideal since you might   change the parent class when refactoring. Another option is to use Object.getPrototypeOf on  ColorWithAlpha.prototype:      var superproto = Object.getPrototypeOf ColorWithAlpha.prototype ;     var result = superproto.brightness.call this  * this.a;  Or use Object.getPrototypeOf twice:      var superproto = Object.getPrototypeOf Object.getPrototypeOf this  ;     var result = superproto.brightness.call this  * this.a;  They’re all awkward, and they all have to manage this by using call. In ES2015+, super just han- dles it for you.  This syntax isn’t just for methods, you can use it to access non-method properties on the prototype as  well. But it’s rare to have non-method properties on class prototype objects, and rarer still to want to  access them directly rather than through the instance.  Inheriting Static Methods  Earlier you learned how to create a static method in a class. In JavaScript, static methods are inher- ited by subclasses. Run Listing 4-7, which shows using fromCSS  which is defined on Color  on  ColorWithAlpha.  LISTING 4-7:  Accessing static methods through subclass—accessing-static-method-through- subclass.js  class Color {        ...same as Listing 4-6... }   class ColorWithAlpha extends Color {        ...same as Listing 4-6... }   const ca = ColorWithAlpha.fromCSS "1E90FF" ; console.log String ca  ;                         "rgba 30, 144, 255, 1 " console.log ca.constructor.name ;                "ColorWithAlpha" console.log ca instanceof ColorWithAlpha ;       true   Creating Subclasses  ❘  87  Note how you can call fromCSS on ColorWithAlpha, and note that the result is a ColorWithAlpha  instance, not a Color instance. Let’s look at why that works.  At the beginning of this section on subclassing, you learned that using the extends clause creates two  inheritance chains: one on the constructor itself, and one on the constructor’s prototype object; see  Figure 4-2, which is a copy of the earlier Figure 4-1.  ColorWithAlpha  Color  Function.prototype  Object.prototype  ColorWithAlpha.prototype  Color.prototype  Object.prototype  FIGURE 4-2   The constructor inheritance chain is a new thing in ES2015. Up through ES5, there was no standard  way to have a true JavaScript function whose prototype was anything but Function.prototype. But  it makes perfect sense for a subclass’s constructor to use the superclass constructor as its prototype,  and consequently to inherit its properties and methods.  But why did fromCSS create a ColorWithAlpha object instead of a Color object, if it’s defined  on Color? We touched on that very briefly earlier in this chapter. Let’s look again at how Color  defines fromCSS:  class Color {        ...       static fromCSS css  {         const match =  ^? [0-9a-f]{3}[0-9a-f]{6} ;?$ i.exec css ;         if  !match  {             throw new Error "Invalid CSS code: " + css ;         }         let vals = match[1];         if  vals.length === 3  {             vals = vals[0] + vals[0] + vals[1] + vals[1] + vals[2] + vals[2];         }         return new this              parseInt vals.substring 0, 2 , 16 ,             parseInt vals.substring 2, 4 , 16 ,             parseInt vals.substring 4, 6 , 16           ;     } }  The key thing there is that it creates the object using new this, rather than new Color. If you call  fromCSS on Color, this within the call is Color; but if you call it on ColorWithAlpha, this within  the call is ColorWithAlpha, so that’s the constructor that gets called by new this. Try copying the  accessing-static-method-through-subclass.js file from the downloads and changing it to   new Color instead.   88  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  super in Static Methods  Since the subclass constructor truly inherits from the superclass constructor, you can use super within  a static subclass method to refer to the superclass version. Suppose you wanted to allow a second  argument to fromCSS for opacity in ColorWithAlpha; see Listing 4-8. The implementation just calls  super.fromCSS and then adds the opacity to the resulting object.  LISTING 4-8:  Using super in a static method—super-in-static-method.js  class Color {        ...same as Listing 4-6... }   class ColorWithAlpha extends Color {     constructor r = 0, g = 0, b = 0, a = 1  {         super r, g, b ;         this.a = a;     }       brightness bgColor  {         let result = super.brightness   * this.a;         if  bgColor && this.a !== 1  {             result =  result +  bgColor.brightness   *  1 - this.a      2;         }         return result;     }       toString   {         return "rgba " + this.r + ", " +                          this.g + ", " +                          this.b + ", " +                          this.a + " ";     }       static fromCSS css, a = 1  {         const result = super.fromCSS css ;         result.a = a;         return result;     } }   const ca = ColorWithAlpha.fromCSS "1E90FF", 0.5 ; console.log String ca  ;                         "rgba 30, 144, 255, 0.5 "  Methods Returning New Instances  In this section you’ll learn about patterns for creating new instances of a class from its methods, both  static methods like Color.fromCSS and instance methods like slice and map on arrays.   Creating Subclasses  ❘  89  You've already seen a static method using one pattern to create an instance of the class:   Color.fromCSS, which uses new this  *...*  to create the new instance. It works pretty well.  When you call Color.fromCSS, you get a Color instance. When you call ColorWithAlpha.fromCSS,  you get a ColorWithAlpha instance. That’s the behavior you usually want. In an instance method,  you’d use this.constructor rather than this, because this.constructor usually refers to the  constructor of the object. For instance, here’s a method for Color that returns a color that’s half the  brightness of the original:  But suppose you wanted to create a Color subclass in which fromCSS and halfBright returned an  instance of Color instead?  That’s a slightly odd thing to have fromCSS do, but let’s ignore that for  the moment.  With the current implementations of fromCSS and halfBright, you’d have to override  them and use Color explicitly, along these lines:  halfBright   {     const ctor = this.constructor  Color;     return new ctor          Math.round this.r   2 ,         Math.round this.g   2 ,         Math.round this.b   2       ; }  class ColorSubclass extends Color {     static fromCSS css  {         return Color.fromCSS css ;     }     halfBright   {         return new Color              Math.round this.r   2 ,             Math.round this.g   2 ,             Math.round this.b   2           ;     } }  That’s okay for just one method or maybe even two. But what if Color had several other opera- tions that created new instances and you wanted those to create Color rather than ColorSubclass  instances? You’d have to override all of them, too. That could start to get messy.  Think about all of  the array methods like slice and map that create new arrays, and the hassle it would be to override  all of them in an array subclass if you didn’t want the default behavior.   If you want most methods that create new instances to use the same constructor in a way that’s easy  for subclasses to override, there’s a better alternative: Symbol.species.  Symbols are something we haven’t covered yet. You’ll learn about them in Chapter 5. For the  moment, all you need to know is that they’re a new kind of primitive, they can be used as a property  key  like a string, but they’re not strings , and that there are “well known” ones available as proper- ties on the Symbol function, including the one we’ll use here: Symbol.species.  Symbol.species is part of a pattern designed specifically to allow subclasses to control what hap- pens in methods that need to create new instances of “the” class. In the base class  Color in this  example , instead of using the constructor the method has from this or this.constructor as we’ve    90  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  done so far, methods using the species pattern determine the constructor to use by looking up the  Symbol.species property on this   this.constructor. If the result is null or undefined, the  class defines a default that it uses instead. In fromCSS that would look like this:  static fromCSS css  {        ...     let ctor = this[Symbol.species];     if  ctor === null  ctor === undefined  {         ctor = Color;     }     return new ctor  *...*  ; }  Since null and undefined are both falsy, and a constructor function by definition is never falsy, you  could simplify that a bit:  static fromCSS css  {        ...     const ctor = this && this[Symbol.species]  Color;     return new ctor  *...*  ; }   Later you’ll learn why we’re using an explicit fallback there, Color, rather than using this.   Note that the code is a bit defensive, checking that this is truthy  since class code is in strict mode  and this can be any value, including undefined .  Again, though, it may be a bit odd for a static method to do that  depending on your use case . Let’s  look at doing it in the prototype method halfBright:  halfBright   {     const ctor = this && this.constructor &&                  this.constructor[Symbol.species]  Color;     return new Color          Math.round this.r   2 ,         Math.round this.g   2 ,         Math.round this.b   2       ; }   In Chapter 19 you’ll learn about optional chaining, which would make the first statement in   halfBright simpler: const ctor = this?.constructor?.[Symbol.species]  Color;   When using the Symbol.species pattern, the base class defines that property in a clever way—as an  accessor returning this:  class Color {     static get [Symbol.species]   {         return this;     }        ... }  That way, if the subclass doesn’t override the Symbol.species property, it’ll be just as though   the class used new this  *...*  : the constructor the method was called on will be used  Color or   ColorWith Alpha, depending . But if the subclass overrides the Symbol.species   property, the constructor from that override gets used instead.   Creating Subclasses  ❘  91  Putting all those pieces together:  class Color {     static get [Symbol.species]   {         return this;     }      static fromCSS css  {         const ctor = this && this[Symbol.species]  Color;         return new ctor  *...*  ;     }      halfBright   {         const ctor = this && this.constructor &&                      this.constructor[Symbol.species]  Color;         return new ctor  *...*  ;     }         ... }  The standard library objects that use this pattern only use it for prototype and instance methods, not  static methods. That’s because there was no strong reason for using it in static methods, and doing  so you end up with odd or even misleading code like ColorWithAlpha.fromCSS returning a Color  instance instead of a ColorWithAlpha instance. See Listing 4-9 for a simple synthetic example more  along the lines of how the standard library uses the species pattern.  LISTING 4-9:  Using Symbol.species—using-Symbol-species.js  class Base {     constructor data  {         this.data = data;     }       static get [Symbol.species]   {         return this;     }       static create data  {            Doesn't use `Symbol.species`         const ctor = this  Base;         return new ctor data ;     }       clone   {            Uses `Symbol.species`         const ctor = this && this.constructor &&                      this.constructor[Symbol.species]  Base;         return new ctor this.data ;     } }    Sub1 uses the default behavior, which is often what you want class Sub1 extends Base { }     92  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes     Sub2 makes any method that respects the pattern use Base instead of Sub2 class Sub2 extends Base {     static get [Symbol.species]   {         return Base;     } }   const a = Base.create 1 ; console.log a.constructor.name ;           "Base" const aclone = a.clone  ; console.log aclone.constructor.name ;      "Base"   const b = Sub1.create 2 ; console.log b.constructor.name ;           "Sub1" const bclone = b.clone  ; console.log bclone.constructor.name ;      "Sub1"   const c = Sub2.create 3 ; console.log c.constructor.name ;           "Sub2" const d = new Sub2 4 ; console.log d.constructor.name ;           "Sub2" console.log d.data ;                       4 const dclone = d.clone  ; console.log dclone.constructor.name ;      "Base" console.log dclone.data ;                  4  Notice how calling create on Sub1 created a Sub1 instance, and calling clone on that instance also  created a Sub1 instance; calling create on Sub2 created a Sub2 instance, but calling clone on a Sub2  instance created a Base instance.  Earlier I said I’d tell you why we’re using an explicit default in that example  Base; and Color in the  earlier examples  if the value of the Symbol.species property is null or undefined. That’s what the  built-in classes like Array do. They could have used this  in static methods  or this.constructor   in prototype methods  as the default instead, but by using an explicit default, they give subclasses of  subclasses a way to ask for the original default rather than the current subclass constructor. So with  the Base from the previous example, in this code:  class Sub extends Base { }   class SubSub1 extends Sub { }   class SubSub2 extends Sub {     static get [Symbol.species]   {         return null;     } }   const x = new SubSub1 1 .clone  ; console.log x.constructor.name ;    "SubSub1"   const y = new SubSub2 2 .clone  ; console.log y.constructor.name ;    "Base", not "SubSub2" or "Sub"   Creating Subclasses  ❘  93  the default from Base is applied in SubSub2’s clone method, rather than something from a subclass.   Try it using explicit-constructor-default.js from the downloads.   Subclassing Built-ins  In ES5, some of the built-in constructors such as Error and Array were notoriously impossible to  properly subclass; that’s been fixed in ES2015. Subclassing a built-in with class is just like subclass- ing anything else.  You can also subclass them without class syntax via Reflect.construct; more  on that in Chapter 14.  Let’s look at an array example. Listing 4-10 shows a very simple Elements  class that extends Array with a style method that sets style information on the DOM elements  in the array. Try running it in a page with at least three div elements in it  there’s a subclassing- array.html file in the downloads you can use .  LISTING 4-10:  Subclassing Array—subclassing-array.js  class Elements extends Array {     select source  {         if  source  {             if  typeof source === "string"  {                 const list = document.querySelectorAll source ;                 list.forEach element => this.push element  ;             } else {                 this.push source ;             }         }         return this;     }       style props  {         this.forEach element => {             for  const name in props  {                 element.style[name] = props[name];             }         } ;         return this;     } }      Usage new Elements       .select "div"      .style {color: "green"}      .slice 1      .style {border: "1px solid red"} ;  The “Usage” code at the end:  ➤➤ Creates an instance of Elements, which is a subclass of Array ➤➤ Uses its select method to add all div elements on the page to the instance  using the array   method push to add them    94  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  ➤➤ Styles those elements with green text ➤➤ Creates a new Elements instance using the array method slice to take just the second and   third div elements  ➤➤ Adds a red border around those div elements with the style method   Note how using slice created a new Elements instance, not just a new Array. That’s because  Array uses the Symbol.species pattern you learned about in the last section, and Elements doesn’t  override the default.   Elements is just an example, of course. In a real implementation, you’d probably pass the selector  into the Elements constructor rather than using a separate select call afterward to populate the  instance. Doing that in a robust way requires using a feature you haven’t learned about yet  iterable  spread, in Chapter 6 . If you want to see what it would look like  also using for-of [Chapter 6],  Object.entries [Chapter 5], and destructuring [Chapter 7] , refer to subclassing-array-using- later-chapter-features.js in the downloads.  Where super Is Available  Before ES2015, we used the term method loosely in JavaScript to refer to any function assigned to  an object property  or perhaps only the ones that use this . As of ES2015, while that’s still common  informally, there is now a distinction between true methods and functions assigned to properties:  code inside a true method has access to super; code in a traditional function assigned to a property  does not. Let’s prove that to ourselves with Listing 4-11: read through and try to run it.  LISTING 4-11:  Method vs. function—method-vs-function.js  class SuperClass {     test   {         return "SuperClass's test";     } } class SubClass extends SuperClass {     test1   {         return "SubClass's test1: " + super.test  ;     } } SubClass.prototype.test2 = function   {     return "SubClass's test2: " + super.test  ;         ERROR HERE };   const obj = new SubClass  ; obj.test1  ; obj.test2  ;  The JavaScript engine will refuse to parse that code, complaining that super wasn’t expected on the  line marked in the listing. But why not?   Creating Subclasses  ❘  95  Because methods have a link to the object on which they’re created, but traditional functions assigned  to properties don’t. When used in a property lookup operation like super.foo, super relies on an  internal field of the containing function called [[HomeObject]]. The JavaScript engine gets the object  from the [[HomeObject]] field of the method, gets its prototype, and then looks for the method   property on that object, like this pseudocode:     Pseudocode let method =  the running method ; let homeObject = method.[[HomeObject]]; let proto = Object.getPrototypeOf homeObject ; let value = proto.foo;  “But wait,” you say. “Why would super care where the method was defined? It just goes to this’s  prototype, right? Or this’s prototype’s prototype?”  No, it can’t work that way. To see why, consider the three-layer hierarchy in Listing 4-12.  LISTING 4-12:  Three-layer hierarchy—three-layer-hierarchy.js  class Base {     test   {         return "Base test";     } } class Sub extends Base {     test   {         return "Sub test > " + super.test  ;     } } class SubSub extends Sub {     test   {         return "SubSub test > " + super.test  ;     } }      Usage: const obj = new SubSub  ; console.log obj.test   ;    SubSub test > Sub test > Base test  When you create that obj instance, its prototype chain looks like Figure 4-3.  obj  SubSub.prototype  Sub.prototype  Base.prototype  Object.prototype  FIGURE 4-3   Let’s suppose super worked from this, knowing that it needed to go to this’s prototype’s   prototype because it’s being used in a prototype method. When you call obj.test, this equals   obj. When it uses super.test  , getting the prototype of the prototype works: the prototype of    96  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  obj is SubSub.prototype, and the prototype of SubSub.prototype is Sub.prototype, so it gets  test from Sub.prototype; all is good so far. Then, it calls Sub.prototype’s test with this set  to obj. As part of its code, Sub.prototype.test also calls super.test  . Now the JavaScript  engine is stuck. It can’t do the same thing it did to get from SubSub to Sub because this is still  obj, so this’s prototype’s prototype is still Sub.prototype, and it would just end up in the same  place. Look through the code in Listing 4-13 and run it; eventually it raises a stack overflow error  because Sub.prototype.test keeps calling itself.  LISTING 4-13:  Broken three-layer hierarchy—broken-three-layer-hierarchy.js  function getFakeSuper o  {     return Object.getPrototypeOf Object.getPrototypeOf o  ; } class Base {     test   {         console.log "Base's test" ;         return "Base test";     } } class Sub extends Base {     test   {         console.log "Sub's test" ;         return "Sub test > " + getFakeSuper this .test.call this ;     } } class SubSub extends Sub {     test   {         console.log "SubSub's test" ;         return "SubSub test > " + getFakeSuper this .test.call this ;     } }      Usage: const obj = new SubSub  ; console.log obj.test   ;    "SubSub's test", then "Sub's test" repeatedly                             until a stack overflow error occurs  That’s why the methods need to have a field saying what object they’re defined on  their   [[Home Object]] , so the JavaScript engine can get that object and then get its prototype to access   the super’s version of test. Refer to Figure 4-4 to follow through the following explanation:   within obj.test, to do super.test   the JavaScript engine looks at the [[HomeObject]] on   obj.test, which is SubSub.prototype, then gets the prototype of that object  Sub.prototype  and  calls the test method on it. To handle the super.test   in Sub.prototype.test, the engine gets  [[HomeObject]] from Sub.prototype.test and gets its prototype, which is Base.prototype, and  then calls the test method on it.   Leaving Off Object.prototype  ❘  97   Object.prototype   Object.prototype   Base.prototype Base.prototype  [[Prototype]] [[Prototype]] test test   function   function   name: "test" name: "test" [[HomeObject]] [[HomeObject]]  obj   object   object   [[Prototype]] [[Prototype]]  SubSub.prototype SubSub.prototype  [[Prototype]] [[Prototype]] test test  Sub.prototype Sub.prototype  [[Prototype]] [[Prototype]] test test   function   function   name: "test" name: "test" [[HomeObject]] [[HomeObject]]   function   function   name: "test" name: "test" [[HomeObject]] [[HomeObject]]  FIGURE 4-4   There is an important consequence of this: copying methods from object to object  a familiar pattern  with “mixins”—objects with utility functions you copy into multiple prototypes  doesn’t change the  method’s [[HomeObject]]. If you use super in a mixin method, it continues to use the prototype of its  original home object, not the prototype of the object it’s been copied to. This can create subtle cross- talk between the method’s original home and the object you copied it to. If you do that on purpose   using a feature of the mixin’s original parent , that’s fine; but if you use super in a mixin method  expecting it to work within the hierarchy of its new home, it’ll be a bug.  At one stage when ES2015 was being developed, there was a function you could use to change the  [[HomeObject]] of a method  specifically to enable mixins , but it was dropped before the spec was  completed and hasn’t been added back  yet . So for the moment at least, define mixins with tradi- tional functions, or don’t use super in them, or if you do, do it because you intend it to continue to  work within its original hierarchy, not its new one.  LEAVING OFF OBJECT.PROTOTYPE  By default, even a base class is effectively a subclass of Object: instances of it inherit from   Object.prototype. That’s where they get their default toString, hasOwnProperty, and other such  methods. That is, the following two classes are effectively the same:  class A {     constructor   {     } }     98  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  class B extends Object {     constructor   {         super  ;     } }   The one small difference is that the prototype of the A function is Function.prototype, but the  prototype of the B function is Object; the prototypes of A.prototype and B.prototype are both  Object.prototype, though.   But suppose you didn’t want your class’s instances to inherit from Object.prototype? That is, you  didn’t want them to have the default toString, hasOwnProperty, and such? It’s a very rare thing to  want to do, but you’re supposed to be able to do it using extends null:  class X extends null { } const o = new X  ; console.log o.toString ;    undefined console.log Object.getPrototypeOf X.prototype  === null ;    true  extends null tells the JavaScript engine to use null as the prototype of the X.prototype object,  instead of using Object.prototype as it normally would.  However, while the intention of the feature was always clear, there were minor issues with the precise  technical details with regard to extends null in the ES2015 and subsequent specifications, which  caused problems for implementations. As a result, extends null doesn’t work yet in most major  JavaScript engines as of this writing.  It fails when doing new X.  If you have a use case requiring  extends null, be sure to test in your target environments.  But you always do that anyway, right?   NEW.TARGET  Functions and constructors can be called in two ways:  ➤➤ Directly  although constructors created via class syntax disallow it  ➤➤ As part of creating an object  via new, super, or Reflect.construct [discussed in   Chapter 14]   Sometimes, it’s important to know how your function was called. Perhaps you want to make a class  abstract  only allow instances to be created as part of a subclass , or final  don’t allow subclasses .  Perhaps you want a function that changes what it does depending on whether it was called via new  or directly.  In those cases, you can use new.target to find out how the function was called. If the function was  called directly  not via new , new.target will have the value undefined:  function example   {     console.log new.target ; } example  ;    undefined   new.target  ❘  99  If the current function was the direct target of the new operator, new.target refers to the   current function:  class Base {     constructor   {         console.log new.target.name ;     } } new Base  ;    "Base"  If the current function was called via super, new.target refers to the subclass constructor that was  the target of new:  class Base {     constructor   {         console.log new.target.name ;     } }   class Sub extends Base {         This is exactly what the default constructor would be, but I've included        it for clarity, to explicitly show the `super  ` call.      constructor   {         super  ;     } }   new Sub  ;     "Sub"   Other ways using Reflect.construct are covered in Chapter 14.   With that in mind, let’s use it for all three of the scenarios mentioned in the section introduction: an  abstract class, a final class, and a function that does different things depending on whether it was  called as a constructor or as a function.  Listing 4-14 defines an abstract class called Shape and two subclasses, Triangle and Rectangle.   An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly instantiated; it can only be instantiated via a  subclass. Shape is made abstract by throwing an error if new.target === Shape is true in the  constructor, since that would mean it was being created via new Shape  or an equivalent . When  instantiating Triangle  for instance , new.target is Triangle, not Shape, so the constructor doesn’t  throw an error.  LISTING 4-14:  Abstract class—abstract-class.js  class Shape {     constructor color  {         if  new.target === Shape  {             throw new Error "Shape can't be directly instantiated" ;         }         this.color = color;     }     100  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes      toString   {         return "[" + this.constructor.name + ", sides = " +                this.sides + ", color = " + this.color + "]";     } } class Triangle extends Shape {     get sides   {         return 3;     } } class Rectangle extends Shape {     get sides   {         return 4;     } } const t = new Triangle "orange" ; console.log String t  ;        "[Triangle, sides = 3, color = orange]"   const r = new Rectangle "blue" ; console.log String r  ;        "[Rectangle, sides = 4, color = blue]"   const s = new Shape "red" ;    Error: "Shape can't be directly instantiated"   Even with the check, it’s possible to create an object that directly uses Shape.prototype as its   prototype, since you don’t have to call Shape to do that [you can use Object.create]. But that   presupposes someone actively working around the way Shape is defined to be used.   A final class is the converse of that; it disallows subclass instances. Listing 4-15 does that by doing the  reverse of the Shape check: it throws an error if new.target isn’t equal to the class’s own construc- tor. When you try to create an instance of InvalidThingy, you get an error.  Unfortunately, it’s not  currently possible to make that error more proactive, throwing it when the InvalidThingy class  definition is evaluated instead of later when new InvalidThingy is used.   LISTING 4-15:  Final class—final-class.js  class Thingy {     constructor   {         if  new.target !== Thingy  {             throw new Error "Thingy subclasses aren't supported." ;         }     } } class InvalidThingy extends Thingy { }   console.log "Creating Thingy..." ; const t = new Thingy  ;            works console.log "Creating InvalidThingy..." ; const i = new InvalidThingy  ;     Error: "Thingy subclasses aren't supported."   As with the Shape example, with Object.create it’s still possible to create objects with a prototype  that inherits from Thingy.prototype, and so which are in some way subclass objects, but again that  presupposes actively working around Thingy.    class Declarations vs. class Expressions  ❘  101  Finally, Listing 4-16 defines a function that does different things depending on whether it was called  as a function or via new; note that you can only do this with a traditional function, because construc- tors defined via class cannot be called except as part of object construction. This example detects it  hasn’t been called via new  or an equivalent  and converts that into a call with new.  LISTING 4-16:  Function that changes based on how it’s called—function-or-constructor.js  const TwoWays = function TwoWays   {     if  !new.target  {         console.log "Called directly; using 'new' instead" ;         return new TwoWays  ;     }     console.log "Called via 'new'" ; }; console.log "With new:" ; let t1 = new TwoWays  ;    "Called via 'new'"   console.log "Without new:" ; let t2 = TwoWays  ;    "Called directly; using 'new' instead"    "Called via 'new'"  CLASS DECLARATIONS VS. CLASS EXPRESSIONS  Like function, class can be used as a declaration or as an expression. And like function, it  depends on the context where it appears: if it appears where either a statement or an expression is  valid, it’s a declaration; if it appears where only an expression is valid, it’s an expression.     Declaration class Class1 { }      Anonymous class expression let Color = class { };      Named class expression let C = class Color { };  class Declarations  class declarations work very similarly to function declarations, although with an important  difference.  Like function declarations, class declarations:  ➤➤ Add the class’s name to the current scope, and ➤➤ Don’t need a semicolon after the closing curly brace.  You can put one there, because Java-  Script ignores unnecessary semicolons, but it’s not needed by the declaration.    102  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  Unlike function declarations, class declarations:  ➤➤ Are not hoisted, they’re half-hoisted: the identifier is reserved throughout the scope, but not   initialized until the declaration is reached in the step-by-step execution of the code.  ➤➤ Participate in the Temporal Dead Zone. ➤➤ Do not create a property on the global object for the class name if used at global scope;   instead, they create globals that aren’t properties of the global object.  Those last bits probably seem familiar. That’s because they’re the same as the rules you learned in  Chapter 2 for let and const. Those rules apply to class declarations, too.  Listing 4-17 demonstrates the various aspects of a class declaration.  The code in Listing 4-17  must be run at global scope to demonstrate what happens with class declarations at global scope.  Remember that you can’t run this in Node.js in the usual way; you have to either use a browser or  run it in Node.js’s REPL environment. See Chapter 1.   LISTING 4-17:  class declarations—class-declarations.js     Trying to use `TheClass` here would result in a ReferenceError    because of the Temporal Dead Zone   let name = "foo" + Math.floor Math.random   * 1000 ;      The declaration class TheClass {        Since the declaration is processed as part of the        step-by-step code, we can use `name` here and know that        it will have the value we assigned it above     [name]   {         console.log "This is the method " + name ;     } }    <== No semicolon expected here      A global was created console.log typeof TheClass ;         "function"      But no property on the global object console.log typeof this.TheClass ;    "undefined"  class Expressions  class expressions work very similarly to function expressions:  ➤➤ They have both named and anonymous forms. ➤➤ They do not add the class’s name to the scope in which they appear, but do make the class’s   name available within the class definition itself  if it has a name .   More to Come  ❘  103  ➤➤ They result in a value  the class’s constructor  that can be assigned to a variable or a   constant, passed into a function, or ignored.  ➤➤ The JavaScript engine will infer the value of the name property for a class created with an  anonymous class expression from context, using the same rules you learned in Chapter 3   for anonymous function expressions.  ➤➤ When used as the right-hand side of an assignment, they do not terminate the assignment   expression; if the class expression is the last thing in the assignment expression, it should be  followed by a semicolon.  In many cases, Automatic Semicolon Insertion [ASI] can correct a  missing semicolon, but not always.   Listing 4-18 demonstrates aspects of the class expression.  LISTING 4-18:  class expressions—class-expressions.js  let name = "foo" + Math.floor Math.random   * 1000 ;      The expression const C = class TheClass {     [name]   {         console.log "This is the method " + name +                     " in the class " + TheClass.name ;            The class name is in-scope -^            within the definition     } };    <== Semicolon needed here  although ASI will supply it           if possible       The class's name was not added to this scope console.log typeof TheClass ;         "undefined"      The value of the expression is the class console.log typeof C ;                "function"  MORE TO COME  There are several more features coming soon to class definitions  likely in ES2021 , such as public  class field  property  declarations, private fields, private methods, public and private static fields, and  private static methods. You can use many of these today with transpilation. These are all covered in  Chapter 18.   104  ❘  CHAPTER 4    Classes  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Just the one “old habit to new” for this chapter.  Use class When Creating Constructor Functions  Old habit: Using traditional function syntax to create constructor functions  because you had  no choice! :  var Color = function Color r, g, b  {     this.r = r;     this.g = g;     this.b = b; }; Color.prototype.toString = function toString   {     return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " "; }; console.log String new Color 30, 144, 255   ;  New habit: Use class instead:  class Color  {     constructor r, g, b  {         this.r = r;         this.g = g;         this.b = b;     }     toString   {         return "rgb " + this.r + ", " + this.g + ", " + this.b + " ";     } }; console.log String new Color 30, 144, 255   ;  This doesn’t mean you should start using class if you don’t use constructor functions; constructor  functions and their prototype property  in both ES5 and ES2015+  are just one way of using Java- Script’s prototypical inheritance. But if you do use constructor functions, then given all the benefits of  conciseness, expressiveness, and functionality, using class instead is clearly beneficial.   New Object Features  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ Computed property names  ➤➤ Shorthand properties  ➤➤ Getting and setting an object’s prototype  ➤➤ __proto__ on browsers  ➤➤ Method syntax, and super outside classes  ➤➤ Symbol  ➤➤ Various new object utility functions  ➤➤ Symbol.toPrimitive  ➤➤ Property order  ➤➤ Property spread syntax  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode   or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter you’ll learn about the new object features in ES2015+, from features that help  you write less repetitive or more concise code to ones that let you do things you couldn’t  do before.   106  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  COMPUTED PROPERTY NAMES  In ES5, if you wanted to create an object with a property whose name came from a variable, you had  to first create the object, then add the property to it as a separate operation, like this:  That’s a bit awkward, so ES2015 added computed property names, which use square brackets  [] ,  just like the square brackets used in the preceding code, in the property definition itself:  var name = "answer"; var obj = {}; obj[name] = 42; console.log obj ;    {answer: 42}  var name = "answer"; var obj = {     [name]: 42 }; console.log obj ;    {answer: 42}  let prefix = "ans"; let obj = {     [prefix + "wer"]: 42 }; console.log obj ;    {answer: 42}   I’ve used var there to emphasize this isn’t related to let, but I’ll go back to using let and  const now.   The brackets in the property definition work just like the brackets you’ve always used when getting  setting property values. That means you can use any expression within the square brackets, and the  result of the expression will be used as the name:  The expression is evaluated immediately, as part of evaluating the object literal, as each property defi- nition is evaluated  in source code order . To illustrate that, the following example does exactly what  the previous one does other than having the extra temporary variables temp and name:  let prefix = "ans"; let temp = {}; let name = prefix + "wer"; temp[name] = 42; let obj = temp; console.log obj ;    {answer: 42}  You can see the order in action here:  let counter = 0; let obj = {     [counter++]: counter++,     [counter++]: counter++ }; console.log obj ;           {"0": 1, "2": 3}   Getting and Setting an Object’s Prototype  ❘  107  Note the order in which counter was used and incremented: first to get the name for the first prop- erty  0, which is converted to "0" when used as a property name , then to get that property’s value   1 , then to get the name for the second property  2, which is converted to "2" , and finally to get that  property’s value  3 .  SHORTHAND PROPERTIES  It’s fairly common to want to create an object with properties whose values come from variables    or other in-scope identifiers, like parameters  of the same name. For instance, suppose you have  a getMinMax function that finds the minimum and maximum numbers in an array and returns an  object with min and max properties. The ES5 version would typically look like this:  function getMinMax nums  {     var min, max;         omitted - find `min` and `max` by looping through `nums`      return {min: min, max: max}; }  Notice the repetition when creating the object at the end, having to specify min and max twice  once  for the name of the property, again for the value for that property .  As of ES2015, you can use shorthand properties. You just give the identifier once, and it’s used both  to name the property and to identify where to get the property value from:  function getMinMax nums  {     let min, max;         omitted - find `min` and `max` by looping through `nums`      return {min, max}; }  Naturally, you can only do this when the value is coming from a simple in-scope identifier  variable,  parameter, etc. ; if the value comes from the result of any other expression, you still need to use the  name: expression form.  GETTING AND SETTING AN OBJECT’S PROTOTYPE  It’s always been possible to create an object inheriting from a specific prototype object via a construc- tor function. ES5 added the ability to do it directly via Object.create, and to get the prototype of  an object via Object.getPrototypeOf. ES2015 adds the ability to set the prototype of an existing  object. It’s a very unusual thing to want to do, but it’s now possible.  Object.setPrototypeOf  The primary way to do it is via Object.setPrototypeOf, which accepts the object to change and the  prototype to give it. Here’s an example:  const p1 = {     greet: function   {         console.log "p1 greet, name = " + this.name ;     }   108  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  }; const p2 = {     greet: function   {         console.log "p2 greet, name = " + this.name ;     } }; const obj = Object.create p1 ; obj.name = "Joe"; obj.greet  ;    p1 greet, name = Joe Object.setPrototypeOf obj, p2 ; obj.greet  ;    p2 greet, name = Joe  In that code, obj starts out using p1 as its prototype, so the first call to obj.greet   uses p1’s greet  and shows "p1 greet, name = Joe". Then the code changes the prototype of obj to use p2, so the  second call to greet uses p2’s greet and shows "p2 greet, name = Joe" instead.  Again, changing the prototype of an object after you’ve created it is unusual, and doing so may well  de-optimize the object, making property lookup on it much slower. But if you absolutely have to do  it, now you can via a standard mechanism.  The __proto__ Property on Browsers  In the browser environment, you can use an accessor property called __proto__ to get and set the  prototype of an object, but don’t do so in new code. Officially, it’s not defined for JavaScript engines  that aren’t in a browser  although the engine may provide it anyway .  NOTE  __proto__ is a legacy feature that’s been standardized only to officially  describe the behavior it had as a non-standard extension. In new code, you  shouldn’t use it; use getPrototypeOf and setPrototypeOf instead.  Here’s an example of using __proto__; this is the same code as an example from the last section  using Object.setPrototypeOf, the only change is the second-to-last line:  const p1 = {     greet: function   {         console.log "p1 greet, name = " + this.name ;     } }; const p2 = {     greet: function   {         console.log "p2 greet, name = " + this.name ;     } }; const obj = Object.create p1 ; obj.name = "Joe"; obj.greet  ;    p1 greet, name = Joe obj.__proto__ = p2; obj.greet  ;    p2 greet, name = Joe   Method Syntax, and super Outside Classes  ❘  109  __proto__ is an accessor property defined by Object.prototype, so the object you use it on has  to inherit from Object.prototype  directly or indirectly  for you to use it. An object created via  Object.create null , for instance, doesn’t have __proto__, and neither would any object that  used that object as its prototype.  The __proto__ Literal Property Name on Browsers  __proto__ can also be used in an object literal to set the prototype of the resulting object:  This is explicit syntax, not a by-product of the __proto__ accessor property, and it only works when  specified literally. For instance, you can’t use a computed property name to do it:  const p = {     hi   {         console.log "hi" ;     } }; const obj = {     __proto__: p }; obj.hi  ;    "hi"  const p = {     hi   {         console.log "hi" ;     } }; const name = "__proto__"; const obj = {     [name]: p }; obj.hi  ;    TypeError: obj.hi is not a function  Again, don’t use __proto__ in new code; use Object.create to create an object with the correct  prototype in the first place, and use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf if  necessary to get or set the prototype afterward. That way, you don’t have to worry about whether  the code is running in a browser or not, and  in the case of the accessor property  whether the object  inherits from Object.prototype or not.  METHOD SYNTAX, AND SUPER OUTSIDE CLASSES  In Chapter 4 you learned about method definitions within class constructs. ES2015 adds method  syntax to object literals, too. Where previously you would have written something verbose with the  function keyword like this:  var obj1 = {     name: "Joe",     say: function   {         console.log this.name ;     } }; obj1.say  ;    "Joe"   110  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  the new method syntax lets you write this:  const obj2 = {     name: "Joe",     say   {         console.log this.name ;     } }; obj2.say  ;    "Joe"  That is, you leave out the colon and the function keyword entirely.  Method syntax is not just a shorthand syntax for defining functions in object literals, although in  most cases it’s fine to act as though it were. As it does in classes, method syntax does both more and  less than a property initialized with a traditional function:  ➤➤ The method doesn’t have a prototype property with an object on it, and can’t be used as a   constructor.  ➤➤ The method gets a link to the object it’s defined on, its home object. The example using   the traditional function  obj1  only created a link from the object to the function, via the  object’s say property; see Figure 5-1. The method syntax example creates a link both ways:  from the object  obj2  to the function  via the say property , and from the function to its  home object  obj2  via [[HomeObject]] field you learned about in Chapter 4; see Figure 5-2.  obj1   object   object    function   function   name: "Joe" name: "Joe" say say  name: "say" name: "say" [[Home0bject]]: null [[Home0bject]]: null  FIGURE 5-1   obj2   object   object   name: "Joe" name: "Joe" say say   function   function   name: "say" name: "say" [[Home0bject]] [[Home0bject]]  FIGURE 5-2   The purpose of the link from the method back to the object is to support using super within the  method. Suppose, for instance, you wanted to create an object whose toString function used its  prototype’s toString, but then made it all caps. In ES5, you would have had to call the prototype’s  function explicitly, like this:  var obj = {     toString: function   {   Method Syntax, and super Outside Classes  ❘  111          return Object.prototype.toString.call this .toUpperCase  ;     } }; console.log obj.toString   ;    "[OBJECT OBJECT]"  With ES2015+, you can use method syntax and super instead:  const obj = {     toString   {         return super.toString  .toUpperCase  ;     } }; console.log obj.toString   ;    "[OBJECT OBJECT]"  The method name doesn’t have to be a literal identifier; as with property keys it can be a string  using  either double or single quotes , or a computed name:  const s = "ple"; const obj = {     "biz-baz"   {          String literal method name         console.log "Ran biz-baz" ;     },     ["exam" + s]   {       Computed method name         console.log "Ran example" ;     } }; obj["biz-baz"]  ;    "Ran biz-baz" obj.example  ;       "Ran example"  At first, super in methods in object literals seems fairly limited, since the object’s prototype is going  to be Object.prototype, because it’s created by an object literal. But as you learned earlier, in  ES2015+ you can change the prototype of an object after it’s created, and on browsers you can use  __proto__ in the literal to set the prototype to something other than Object.prototype to start  with  though it’s best not to do that in new code . The way super is implemented ensures that if you  do that, it works as expected:  const obj = {     toString   {         return super.toString  .toUpperCase  ;     } }; Object.setPrototypeOf obj, {     toString   {         return "a different string";     } } ; console.log obj.toString   ;    "A DIFFERENT STRING"  This is where [[HomeObject]] comes in. The way the JavaScript engine handles a property reference  on super  such as super.toString , with some details skipped for clarity, is this:  1.   It gets the value of the current function’s [[HomeObject]] internal slot. In this example, that’s  the object obj refers to.   112  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  2.   3.   It gets the current prototype of that object  as of when the super.toString code is run, not  when the function was created .  It looks up the property on that prototype object, and uses it.  By the time the example calls obj.toString  , the code has already changed the prototype of  the object obj refers to, so the new prototype’s toString is used instead of the original proto- type’s toString.  In theory, the [[HomeObject]] link is there whether the method uses super or not. In practice, Java- Script engines are likely to optimize the link away if you don’t use super  and also don’t use things  like eval that limit their ability to optimize in the method .  SYMBOL  Up through ES5, property names  “keys”  were always strings  even the ones frequently written  as numbers, such as array indexes . As of ES2015, that changed: property keys can now be strings  or Symbols.  A Symbol is a unique primitive value. Being unique is its primary purpose and feature. Although the  use of Symbols goes beyond object properties, I’ve included them in this chapter because that’s where  you’ll normally use them.  “NAME” OR “KEY”?  Is it a property “name,” or a property “key”? The answer is: yes. The specification  has this to say:  “Properties are identified using key values. A property key value is either an  ECMAScript String value or a Symbol value. All String and Symbol values, including  the empty string, are valid as property keys. A property name is a property key that  is a String value.”  So in theory it’s a property “key” if it could be a string or a Symbol, a property  “name” if it’s a string. But it’s still common  including in the specification text itself   to refer to “a property named P” where P could be a string or a Symbol, and as  you’ll learn later the ES5 function Object.keys includes strings but doesn’t   include Symbols  if it had been added in ES2015, perhaps it would have been called  Object.names—or perhaps it would have included Symbols . So don’t read too  much into “key” vs. “name”; people will often say “name” when they should, by the  specification’s definition at least, say “key.”  Why Symbols?  We’ll look at how you create and use Symbols in a moment, but first let’s ask the question: Why is it  so important to have guaranteed-unique values you can use as property keys?   Symbol  ❘  113  Guaranteed-unique values are just generally useful  as the popularity of GUIDs demonstrates , but  one key motivator for Symbols in JavaScript was that they made it possible to add several things to  ES2015 that couldn’t have been added otherwise. Several of the new features require looking for new  properties on objects and using them if they exist. That wouldn’t be backward-compatible if the keys  were strings.  For example, the toString function on Object.prototype creates a string in the form "[object  XYZ]". For objects created by the built-in constructors like Date, the XYZ will be the name of the  constructor  "[object Date]", "[object Array]", etc. . But before ES2015, for instances created  by your own constructors  or just plain objects , the string would just be "[object Object]".  In ES2015, TC39 wanted to be able to let the programmer decide what the XYZ should be with the  default toString, by specifying an object property with the name that should be used. The problem  is, there’s no safe string name they could have picked for that property, because any string name they  picked may have been used in the wild for a different purpose, so using it might break existing code. But  they couldn’t just start using the name of the constructor, either, because that would also break existing  code that relied on seeing "[object Object]" for those objects. The new feature had to be opt-in.  Symbols to the rescue! Object.toString looks for a property identified by a Symbol, not a string.  That means it can’t conflict with any other property that may exist on objects defined before ES2015   since Symbols didn’t exist yet . Here’s that property in action:  class Example1 { } class Example2 {    get [Symbol.toStringTag]   {      return "Example2";    } } console.log new Example1  .toString   ;    "[object Object]" console.log new Example2  .toString   ;    "[object Example2]"  The value of Symbol.toStringTag is a predefined well-known Symbol1 that the   Object.prototype.toString method looks for: when it would have returned "[object Object]"  in ES5, in ES2015+ it looks for the Symbol.toStringTag property and if its value is a string,  toString uses its value for the XYZ part of the resulting "[object XYZ]" string; if not, it uses  Object as it used to. In the example, new Example1  .toString   returned "[object Object]"  because there was no property on the object with the appropriate Symbol name. But the call to new  Example2  .toString   returned "[object Example2]" because the property was there  inherited  from Example.prototype  and had the value "Example2".  The common use case for toStringTag is classes as in the preceding example, but it works just as  well for plain objects, which is useful if you prefer other types of object factories rather than con- structor functions:     Direct usage const obj1 = {     [Symbol.toStringTag]: "Nifty" }; console.log obj1.toString   ;    "[object Nifty]"    1 You’ll learn more about well-known Symbols later in this chapter.   114 ❘ CHAPTER 5    NEW OBJECT FEATURES        Via a prototype     const p = {       [Symbol.toStringTag]: "Spiffy"   };     const obj2 = Object.create p ;     console.log obj2.toString   ;    "[object Spiffy]"        Enough of the why  of Symbols, let ’ s look at the  how .  Creating and Using Symbols   You get a new, unique Symbol by calling the Symbol  function. It ’ s not a constructor—remember, Sym- bols are primitives—so you don ’ t use new . Once you have your Symbol, you can add it to an object using computed property name notation during creation, or using brackets notation after creation:      const mySymbol = Symbol  ;     const obj = {         [mySymbol]: 6                     Computed property name   };     const anotherSymbol = Symbol  ;   obj[anotherSymbol] = 7;               Brackets notation     console.log obj[mySymbol] ;           6     console.log obj[anotherSymbol] ;      7        As an aid to debugging, you can give a Symbol a description when creating it, by passing a string into Symbol :      const mySymbol = Symbol "my symbol" ;     console.log mySymbol ;    Symbol my symbol       In an environment where console.log  shows a representation of the Symbol, the  console.log  of  mySymbol  in that code might show "Symbol my symbol ", which is the string returned by toString on Symbols .    As of ES2019, a Symbol ’ s description is available as a description  property on the Symbol:      const mySymbol = Symbol "my symbol" ;   console.log mySymbol.description ;    "my symbol"      The description is purely a description, it has no other meaning.  Later, you ’ ll see Symbol.for , in which the description is also used for another purpose.  The description is not the value of the Sym- bol, and two different Symbols can have the same description but still be different Symbols:      const a = Symbol "my symbol" ;     console.log a ;          Symbol my symbol      const b = Symbol "my symbol" ;     console.log b ;          Symbol my symbol      console.log a === b ;    false     const obj = {         [a]: 6,       [b]: 7   };     console.log obj[a] ;     6     console.log obj[b] ;     7     Symbol  ❘  115  Properties keyed by Symbols rather than strings are not included in for-in loops or the array  returned by Object.keys, even when they’re enumerable properties  and own2 properties, in the case  of Object.keys .  Symbols Are Not for Privacy  One common misconception about Symbols is that they’re for private properties. For instance, con- sider this code:  const everUpward =     => {     const count = Symbol "count" ;     return {         [count]: 0,         increment   {             return ++this[count];         },         get   {             return this[count];         }     }; }   ; console.log everUpward.get   ;               0 everUpward.increment  ; console.log everUpward.get   ;               1 console.log everUpward["count"] ;            undefined console.log everUpward[Symbol "count" ] ;    undefined  If you don’t have access to the Symbol stored in count, you can’t get the property, right? It’s not the  "count" property, after all, and the count constant is private to the function in which it’s declared.  No, the Symbol stored in count isn’t private  even though the constant referring to it is  because  Symbols are discoverable. For instance, you can get the Symbols an object uses via the aptly named  Object.getOwnPropertySymbols. Since they’re discoverable, Symbols don’t provide any privacy for  properties. A bit of obscurity, perhaps, particularly if you don’t give them descriptions; but no privacy.  Truly private properties will be introduced in ES2020 or later via an entirely different mechanism  see  Chapter 18 , or you can use a WeakMap  Chapter 12  to hold truly private information for an object.  So why the misconception? Partially because of the path Symbols took on their way to being added  to JavaScript: they started life as “private Name objects” and were indeed originally expected to be  used as a mechanism for creating private properties on objects. Over time, their name changed, they  became primitives, and using them for private properties didn’t pan out, but having a guaranteed- unique identifier turned out to be quite useful, so Symbols were kept.  Global Symbols  When you call Symbol to create your Symbol, only your code knows about it unless you make it  accessible to other code somehow  for instance, by making it the key of a property on an object .   2  Remember that objects can inherit properties, and they can have their own properties. An “own” property is a property   that exists directly on the object, rather than being inherited.   116  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  Normally that’s what you want. But a complication can arise, particularly for library authors, espe- cially when you need to use Symbols across realms.  A realm is the overall container in which a bit of code lives, consisting of a global environment, the  intrinsics for that environment  Array, Object, Date, etc. , all the code loaded into that environment,  and other bits of state and such. If you think of a browser, the realm your code lives in is the win- dow for the page you’ve included it in and all of that window’s associated stuff  pardon the techni- cal jargon .  Your code doesn’t only have access to its own realm, though, it can also get access to things in other  realms: a child window has a different realm from its parent window, a web worker has its own  realm distinct from the realm that created it, etc. But in many cases, code in those realms can pass  objects between the realms. That’s not a problem, but if code in two different realms needs to share  access to a property identified by a Symbol, then the Symbol needs to be shared as well. This is where  global Symbols come in.  For instance, suppose you’re writing a class called BarkCounter, and BarkCounter stores informa- tion on objects using a Symbol. See the fairly silly example in Listing 5-1.  LISTING 5-1:  A silly BarkCounter class, version 1—barkcounter-version-1.js  const BarkCounter =     => {     const barks = Symbol "nifty-barks" ;       return class BarkCounter {         constructor other = null  {             this[barks] = other && barks in other ? other[barks] : 0;         }           bark   {             return ++this[barks];         }                  showBarks label  {             console.log label + ": Barks = " + this[barks] ;         }     }; }   ;  Instances of the BarkCounter class count the number of times you call bark on them  I told you it  was silly . They respond to a bark call by incrementing the count and returning the new value. They  store the count of bark calls in a property keyed with the Symbol stored in the barks constant. If you  pass an object into the BarkCounter constructor that has a property keyed with that Symbol, it cop- ies the count of barks from that instance; otherwise, it starts at 0. You can ask it to show the number  of barks in the console, but you can’t ask it to give you the number of barks.  Here’s BarkCounter in action:  const b1 = new BarkCounter  ; b1.bark  ; b1.bark  ; b1.showBarks "b1" ;              b1: Barks = 2   Symbol  ❘  117  const b2 = new BarkCounter b1 ; b2.showBarks "b2" ;              b2: Barks = 2  Notice that that code successfully copied the barks count from b1 to b2. That’s because the code cre- ating b2 passes b1 into the same BarkCounter constructor that created it, so the same Symbol is used  when looking up the number of barks on b1.  Let’s look at a cross-realm example by using BarkCounter in a main window and in an iframe, pass- ing an instance of BarkCounter from the main window to the iframe. See Listings 5-2 and 5-3.  LISTING 5-2:  Using BarkCounter cross-realm: Main, version 1—barkcounter-main-1.html           BarkCounter Across Realms - Main - Version 1           var barkCounterFrame = document.createElement "iframe" ; barkCounterFrame.addEventListener "load", function   {     const b1 = new BarkCounter  ;     b1.bark  ;     b1.bark  ;     b1.showBarks "main" ;              main: Barks = 2     barkCounterFrame.contentWindow.useBarkCounter b1 ; } ; barkCounterFrame.src = "barkcounter-frame-1.html"; document.body.appendChild barkCounterFrame ;                 BarkCounter Across Realms - Frame - Version 1           function useBarkCounter b1  {     b1.showBarks "frame-b1" ;     const b2 = new BarkCounter b1 ;     b2.showBarks "frame-b2" ; }        LISTING 5-3:  Using BarkCounter cross-realm: Frame, version 1—barkcounter-frame-1.html   118  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  barkcounter-main-1.html loads an iframe, and once it’s loaded creates an instance of   BarkCounter  b1  and passes it to a global function in the iframe called useBarkCounter. The   main window and the iframe are different realms.  barkcounter-frame-1.html’s useBarkCounter receives the BarkCounter instance and, like the  code shown earlier, passes it into the BarkCounter constructor, which tries to copy the number of  barks from b1 into the new instance.  Copy those files along with barkcounter-version-1.js to your local web server, then in your  browser open the developer tools console and load barkcounter-main-1.html. The output is:  main: Barks = 2 frame-b1: Barks = 2 frame-b2: Barks = 0  The barks property didn’t get copied.  If it had, that last line would show 2, not 0.  Why not?  The problem is that the copy of BarkCounter loaded into the main window is separate from the copy  of BarkCounter loaded in the iframe window, and they both create their own barks Symbol. Those  Symbols are, by definition, not equal, so when the BarkCounter constructor tried to get the number  of barks from b1, it didn’t see any and used 0 as its starting point.  Ideally, all loaded copies of BarkCounter should share the same Symbol for barks. You could do that  by passing the Symbol from the main window to the iframe along with b1, but that gets complicated  quickly. In this particular case you could also loop through the properties of b1 and see if any were  named with a Symbol that had the appropriate description, but that doesn’t work in all situations   not least if the Symbol doesn’t have a description, or a different Symbol has the same description .  Instead, you can do it by publishing the Symbol to the global Symbol registry associated with a string  key by using the Symbol.for function instead of the Symbol function. It’s a small modification to the  BarkCounter code, changing this line:  const barks = Symbol "nifty-barks" ;  to this:  const barks = Symbol.for "nifty-barks" ;  Symbol.for checks to see if there’s a Symbol in the global registry for the key you provide and  returns it if there is; if not, it creates a new Symbol  using the key as the description , adds it to the  registry, and returns that new Symbol.  That change is in the “–2” versions of the files  barkcounter-version-2.js, barkcounter- main-2.html, and barkcounter-frame-2.html . Load those onto your local server and run them in  the browser, and you’ll see:  main: Barks = 2 frame-b1: Barks = 2 frame-b2: Barks = 2  Both copies of BarkCounter use the same global Symbol: the main file’s call to Symbol.for created  and registered it, then the frame file’s Symbol.for call retrieved the registered Symbol. So copying the    Symbol  ❘  119  number of barks from b1 to b2 works, because both BarkCounter constructors use the same Symbol  for the property.  As with global variables, avoid global Symbols when you have other alternatives, but use them when  they’re the right thing. If you do use them, be sure to use a sufficiently unique name to avoid conflicts  with other uses, or with ones that may be defined in future versions of the specification.  You’ll see a particularly handy use of global Symbols in Chapter 6 when learning about iterators and  iterables.  One final thing about global Symbols: if you need to know if a Symbol is in the global Symbol regis- try, and if so what key it’s assigned to, you can use Symbol.keyFor:  const s = Symbol.for "my-nifty-symbol" ; const key = Symbol.keyFor s ; console.log key ;    "my-nifty-symbol"  Symbol.keyFor returns undefined if the Symbol you pass to it isn’t in the global registry.  Well-Known Symbols  The specification defines several well-known Symbols that get used by various operations in the lan- guage. These Symbols are accessible via properties on the Symbol function. You saw one of these in  Chapter 4  Symbol.species  and another earlier in this chapter  Symbol.toStringTag . Here’s a list  of all of the well-known Symbols in ES2015–ES2018  ES2019 didn’t add any and it doesn’t look like  ES2020 will  and the chapter they’re covered in:  ➤➤ Symbol.asyncIterator  Chapter 9  ➤➤ Symbol.hasInstance  Chapter 17  ➤➤ Symbol.isConcatSpreadable  Chapter 17  ➤➤ Symbol.iterator  Chapter 6  ➤➤ Symbol.match  Chapter 10  ➤➤ Symbol.replace  Chapter 10  ➤➤ Symbol.search  Chapter 10  ➤➤ Symbol.species  Chapter 4  ➤➤ Symbol.split  Chapter 10  ➤➤ Symbol.toPrimitive  Chapter 5  ➤➤ Symbol.toStringTag  Chapter 5  ➤➤ Symbol.unscopables  Chapter 17   All currently defined well-known Symbols are also global  so they’re shared across realms , although  the spec leaves the door open to having some that aren’t global in the future.   120  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  NEW OBJECT FUNCTIONS  Object.assign  ES2015 and ES2017 added a few new functions to the Object constructor. Let’s run through them.  Object.assign is JavaScript’s version of the common “extend” function that copies properties from  one or more source objects into a target object. Suppose you have a function that presents a message  box to a user that supports the options title, text, icon, className, and buttons, where all of  them  and even the options object itself  are optional.3 That’s a fair number of options. You could  accept them as parameters to the function, but doing that raises some issues:  ➤➤ You have to remember the order when writing calls to the function  though your IDE may   be able to help .  ➤➤ If most of them are optional, the code in the function that figures out which options the   caller has supplied and which they omitted can quickly become quite complex.  ➤➤ If several have the same type  most of the options in this example are strings , it can   be not just complex, but impossible for the function code to determine which ones the  caller supplied.  Although you could use the default parameter values feature you learned about in Chapter 3 and pass  undefined for the ones you want defaults for, that’s quite awkward.  In this situation, it’s common to use an object with properties for the options, instead of discrete  parameters. To make some of those properties optional, the usual approach is to copy the passed-in  object and mix in defaults from a defaults object. In ES5 without any helper functions, it looks some- thing like this, which is fairly cumbersome:  function showDialog opts  {     var options = {};     var optionName;     var hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;     for  optionName in defaultOptions  {         if  hasOwn.call defaultOptions, optionName   {             options[optionName] = defaultOptions[optionName];         }     }     if  opts  {    remember that `opts` is optional         for  optionName in opts  {             if  hasOwn.call opts, optionName   {                 options[optionName] = opts[optionName];             }         }     }         Use `options.title`, `options.text`, etc.  }  3 Okay, granted, text would probably be required in the real world. But let’s say it’s optional here.   New Object Functions  ❘  121  This is so common and so cumbersome that the “extend” function became common in many tool- kits  jQuery, Underscore Lodash, etc.  and became an idiom in JavaScript. The traditional “extend”  accepts a target object and then any number of source objects, copying own, enumerable properties  from the source objects to the target object, and then returning the target object as its return value.  Which is what Object.assign does. Here’s that showDialog function using Object.assign rather  than using inline code  and switching to const, although it’s not necessary :  function showDialog opts  {     const options = Object.assign {}, defaultOptions, opts ;         Use `options.title`, `options.text`, etc.  }  Much cleaner! That creates an object and passes it as the first argument  the “target” object ,  followed by the source objects to copy, then remembers that object  which is the return value   in options.  Object.assign works through the source objects  defaultOptions and opts in the example  in  order left-to-right, so the last one “wins” when more than one of them has a value for the same  property  since its value overwrites any previous ones .That means the final options object will have  options from opts for the options opts has, or defaults from defaultOptions for the ones opts  doesn’t have.  Object.assign skips arguments that are null or undefined, so the showDialog code doesn’t have  to do anything to handle the case where opts wasn’t provided by the caller at all.  Like the “extend” functions that inspired it, Object.assign only copies own, enumerable properties  from the source objects, not inherited ones, and not ones marked non-enumerable, just like the loops  in the cumbersome version did. It returns the target object. However, it copies properties keyed by  Symbols as well as those keyed by strings, which the for-in example earlier would not  for-in only  loops through the string-named properties of an object .  In Chapter 7 you’ll learn a different way you can solve this specific problem using destructuring  parameters, and later in this chapter you’ll learn about ES2018’s property spread, which works a lot  like Object.assign but doesn’t quite replace it  as you’ll learn later .  Object.is  ES2015’s Object.is compares two values according to the specification’s SameValue abstract opera- tion. The SameValue operation is like ===  strict equality  except:  ➤➤ NaN is equal to itself  whereas NaN === NaN is false  ➤➤ Positive zero  +0  and negative zero  -0  are not equal to each other  whereas +0 ===   -0 is true   So:  console.log Object.is +0, -0  ;      false console.log Object.is NaN, NaN  ;    true  and for everything else, it’s just like ===.   122  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  Object.values  ES5 added Object.keys, which gives you an array of the names of the object’s own, enumerable  properties whose keys are strings  not Symbols . Object.values, added in ES2017, is the logical  counterpart: it provides an array of the values of those same properties.  const obj = {     a: 1,     b: 2,     c: 3 }; console.log Object.values obj  ;    [1, 2, 3]  The values of inherited properties, non-enumerable properties, and properties keyed by Symbols are  not included.  Object.entries  Rounding out the list of ways of accessing the own, enumerable string-keyed properties, ES2017 also  added Object.entries, which gives you an array of [name, value] arrays:  const obj = {     a: 1,     b: 2,     c: 3 }; console.log Object.entries obj  ;    [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]  Object.entries makes for quite a powerful tool, particularly in combination with the for-of   loop you’ll learn about in Chapter 6; destructuring, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 7; and  Object.fromEntries, which you’ll learn about . . . now!  Object.fromEntries  Object.fromEntries is a utility function added in ES2019 that accepts a list  any iterable  of key  value pairs and creates an object from them:  const obj = Object.fromEntries [     ["a", 1],     ["b", 2],     ["c", 3] ] ; console.log obj ;    => {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}  fromEntries is the converse of Object.entries. It’s also handy for turning a Map  Chapter 12    into an object, since Map.prototype.entries returns the exact type of list Object.fromEntries   expects.  Object.getOwnPropertySymbols  ES2015’s Object.getOwnPropertySymbols is the counterpoint to the ES5 method   Object.getOwnProperty Names but, as the method name suggests, it returns an array of Symbols   for the object’s own Symbol-named properties  whereas Object.getOwnPropertyNames returns   an array of strings for the string-named ones .   Symbol.toPrimitive ❘ 123    Object. getOwnPropertyDescriptors   ES2017 ’ s  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors  returns an object with property descriptors for all  of the object ’ s own properties  including non-enumerable ones and ones keyed with Symbols rather than strings .    One use for it is passing the object it returns into  Object.defineProperties  on another object, to copy the definitions to that object:      const s = Symbol "example" ;     const o1 = {          A property named with a Symbol       [s]: "one",            An accessor property         get example   {           return this[s];       },         set example value  {           this[s] = value;       },            A data property       data: "value"     };        A non-enumerable property     Object.defineProperty o1, "nonEnum", {         value: 42,         writable: true,       configurable: true   } ;        Copy those properties to a new object     const descriptors = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors o1 ;   const o2 = Object.defineProperties {}, descriptors ;     console.log o2.example ;    "one"   o2.example = "updated";   console.log o2[s] ;         "updated", the accessor property wrote to the [s] prop   console.log o2.nonEnum ;    42     console.log o2.data ;       "value"      Contrast this with using Object.assign  in that same situation, which wouldn ’ t copy the accessor property as an accessor property; instead, it would copy the value  returned by the accessor property as of when  Object.assign  was called. It also wouldn ’ t copy the non-enumerable property.    SYMBOL. TOPRIMITIVE  Symbol.toPrimitive  provides a new, more powerful way to hook into the conversion of your  objects to primitive values.    First, a bit of background. Famously, JavaScript coerces converts values in various contexts, including coercing converting objects to primitive values. The operation being done may prefer the result to be a number or a string  or may have no preference . For instance, in  n - obj   where  obj is an object , the preference is to convert obj  to a number so the subtraction can be carried out. But  in  n + obj , there ’ s no preference for number vs. string. Other times, such as  String obj   or    124 ❘ CHAPTER 5    NEW OBJECT FEATURES  someString.indexOf obj  , the preference is for a string. In specification terms, there ’ s a “hint” to  the ToPrimitive operation which is either Number, String, or absent  meaning no preference .    For your own objects, traditionally you ’ ve hooked into this conversion process by implementing  toString   which is used by operations preferring a string  and or  valueOf   which is used by all oth- ers, so both those that prefer a number and those that have no preference . That works fairly well, but  it does mean that your object can ’ t do different things when the preference is for a number or there ’ s no preference at all; those two things are lumped together into valueOf .   Symbol.toPrimitive  solves that problem. If your object has a method keyed by Symbol.to Primitive  either an “own” method or an inherited one , that method gets used rather than valueOf  or toString.  Even better, it receives the preferred type  the type hint   as an argument:  "default"  if the operation has no preference. Suppose you have this object:  "number" , "string" , or   t      const obj = {         [Symbol.toPrimitive] hint  {             const result = hint === "string" ? "str" : 42;             console.log "hint = " + hint + ", returning " + JSON.stringify result  ;           return result;       }     };        If you use the addition operator   +   on that, since there ’ s no preference, your Symbol.toPrimitive method is called with the hint "default" :      It ’ s  "default"  whether the other operand is a string, number, or something else:      console.log "foo" + obj ;        hint = default, returning 42      foo42      console.log 2 + obj ;      hint = default, returning 42      44        console.log 2 - obj ;      hint = number, returning 42        -40        But with the subtraction operator   - , the hint is  "number" :      When a string is desired, unsurprisingly the hint is "string" :      console.log String obj  ;        hint = string, returning "str"      str     console.log "this is a string".indexOf obj  ;      hint = string, returning "str"      10  the index of "str" in "this is a string"       Your method must return a primitive value or a TypeError occurs. The value does  not  have to match the hint. The hint is just a hint, you can still return  for instance  a number even if the hint is for a  string, or a boolean even if the hint is for a number.   t  Symbol.toPrimitive  takes some magic out of the specification that was there for the Date object. Until ES2015, the internal operation ToPrimitive uses that decides whether to call valueOf  or toString   called [[DefaultValue]]  had a special case for Date objects: if there was no type hint, the    Property Order  ❘  125  default was to act as though the hint were Number except for Date objects, which defaulted to String  instead. That’s why Date objects get converted to string when you use + on them, even though they  get converted to numbers when you use - on them. Without Symbol.toPrimitive, it was impossible  to do that in your own objects.  For completeness, if your object doesn’t have a Symbol.toPrimitive method, the specification  defines that, effectively, the following is done:  [Symbol.toPrimitive] hint  {     let methods = hint === "string"             ? ["toString", "valueOf"]             : ["valueOf", "toString"];     for  const methodName of methods  {         const method = this[methodName];         if  typeof method === "function"  {             const result = method.call this ;             if  result === null  typeof result !== "object"  {                 return result;             }         }     }     throw new TypeError  ; }  PROPERTY ORDER  It used to be one of those shout-it-from-the-rooftops things: “Object properties have no order!”   But . . . people kept expecting object properties to have order, particularly properties with names like  1, 7, and 10, such as those in arrays  those names are strings, remember; see the “A Myth of Arrays”  inset , which people overwhelmingly expect to be visited in numeric order even when using object   not array  iteration mechanisms like for-in. And early JavaScript engines gave properties an appar- ent order, which later engines copied  though often with slight differences , and people relied on.  A MYTH OF ARRAYS  Standard arrays in JavaScript are a bit of a myth: as defined in the specification, they  aren’t arrays in the classic computing sense of being a contiguous block of memory  divided into equally sized slots.  JavaScript does have those now in the form of   typed arrays, as you’ll learn in Chapter 11.  They’re just objects that inherit from  Array.prototype, have special behavior associated with their length property,   and have properties whose names, although strings, are array indexes by the   specification’s definition.  An array index4 is a property name consisting entirely   of digits which, when converted to a number, is a whole number whose value is   0 ≤ value < 232–1.  Other than that, arrays are just objects like any other. Of course,  JavaScript engines heavily optimize arrays where possible, in many cases making  them actual arrays, but they’re defined as objects, which has ramifications such as  the fact that the keys you get if you apply for-in to an array are strings.  4 https:  tc39.github.io ecma262 sec-object-type   126  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  Because people kept wanting or even relying on property order, and JavaScript engines had settled on  two similar  but different  orders, to make things predictable the order was standardized in ES2015,  but only for certain operations, and only for “own” properties  not inherited properties . The order is:  ➤➤ First, properties whose keys are strings that are integer indexes, in numeric order. An    integer index is a string that is all digits and that, when converted to a number, is in the range  0 ≤ value < 253–1.  This is slightly different from an array index [see “A Myth of Arrays”   earlier], which has a lower upper bound.   ➤➤ Then, other properties whose keys are strings, in the order the property was created on   ➤➤ Then, properties whose keys are Symbols, in the order the property was created on   the object.  the object.  In ES2015-ES2019, that order did not apply to the for-in loop  not even just the   order of “own” properties  or the arrays returned by Object.keys, Object.values, or   Object.entries. That way, JavaScript engines didn’t have to change the order of those   existing operations if their implementers didn’t want to risk impacting existing code. The new  order was specified for many other methods, such as Object.getOwnPropertyNames and   JSON.stringify from ES5 and Object.getOwnPropertySymbols and Reflect.ownKeys   from ES2015. But ES2020 updates even for-in and the methods listed above and such, provided  that neither the object nor any of its prototypes is a Proxy  Chapter 14 , a typed array or similar   Chapter 11 , a module namespace object  Chapter 13 , or an “exotic” host-provided object  like a  DOM element .  In the general case, despite there being a defined order now, it’s rarely if ever a good idea to rely on  the order of properties in an object. Doing so is brittle. For instance, suppose you have a function that  adds two properties to an object:  function example obj  {     obj.answer = 42;     obj.question = "Life, the Universe, and Everything";     return obj; }  If you call it with an object with no answer or question property, like this:  const obj = example {} ;  then the order will reliably be answer, then question, because that’s the order in which the code  adds the properties.  But suppose you pass it an object with a question property on it already:  const obj = example {question: "What's the meaning of life?"} ;  Now, the order is question, then answer, because question was added to the object first  example  just updated the value of the property instead of creating it .   Property Spread Syntax  ❘  127  PROPERTY SPREAD SYNTAX  Sometimes, you want to create an object with all of the properties of another object, perhaps updat- ing a couple of their values. This is particularly prevalent when programming with the “immutable”  approach where you never modify an object; instead, you create a new replacement object incorporat- ing the modifications.  Before ES2018, doing that required explicitly specifying the properties to copy, or writing a   for-in loop or similar, or using a helper function such as the common extend idiom mentioned   earlier in this chapter, perhaps even JavaScript’s own Object.assign. In ES2018+, you can use   property spread syntax instead.  Let’s look again at that example usage of Object.assign from earlier in this chapter:  function showDialog opts  {     const options = Object.assign {}, defaultOptions, opts ;         Use `options.title`, `options.text`, etc.  }  ES2018 provides a way to do it with syntax instead of a function call: within an object literal, you  can use an ellipsis  ...  in front of any expression to “spread out” the own, enumerable properties of  the expression’s result.5 Here’s that showDialog example using property spread:  function showDialog opts  {     const options = {...defaultOptions, ...opts};         Use `options.title`, `options.text`, etc.  }  That creates a new object, filling it in with properties from defaultOptions, and then with proper- ties from opts. As always in object literals, properties are processed in source code order  top down,  left to right  so if defaultOptions and opts both have a property with the same name, the value  from opts “wins.”  Property spread is only valid within an object literal. It works almost exactly like Object.assign:  if the source of the property spread  the result of the expression that follows the ellipsis  is null  or undefined, the property spread does nothing  it’s not an error ; and property spread only uses  the object’s own, enumerable properties, not ones inherited from its prototype or non-enumerable  properties.  At first glance, it seems like you could use property spread instead of Object.assign everywhere,  but Object.assign still has a role: it can assign to an existing object, whereas property spread can  only be used when creating a new object.  5  If the expression results in a primitive, that primitive is coerced to object before the spread operation begins. For   instance, a primitive string is coerced to a String object.   128  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  NOTE  It’s tempting to think of ... as an operator, but it isn’t one, and can’t  be. An operator is like a function: it has operands  like a function’s arguments   and produces a single result value  like a function’s return value . But no “result  value” can say “create these properties in the object.” So the ellipsis is primary  syntax notation; not an operator. It’s like the parentheses around a while loop’s  condition: in that case,    aren’t the grouping operator, they’re just part of the  syntax of a while loop. The distinction matters, because an operator can be  used anywhere an expression is expected; ... can only be used in certain specific  places  for property spread, only inside an object literal .  OLD HABITS TO NEW  All these new syntax features and helpers give us a few habits we can update:  Use Computed Syntax When Creating Properties with  Dynamic Names  Old habit: Creating properties whose names are determined at runtime as a second step after creating  the object:  New habit: Use computed property names instead:  let name = "answer"; let obj = {}; obj[name] = 42; console.log obj[name] ;    42  let name = "answer"; let obj = {     [name]: 42 }; console.log obj[name] ;    42  Use Shorthand Syntax When Initializing a Property from a  Variable with the Same Name  Old habit: Providing the name of a property even when the property’s value is coming from an   in-scope identifier  for instance, a variable  with the same name:  function getMinMax   {     let min, max;        ...     return {min: min, max: max}; }   Old Habits to New  ❘  129  New habit: Use shorthand property syntax instead:  function getMinMax   {     let min, max;        ...     return {min, max}; }  Use Object.assign instead of Custom “Extend” Functions or  Copying All Properties Explicitly  Old habit: Using a custom extend  or similar  function or laboriously copying all of the  own, enu- merable  properties from one object to another existing object with a loop.  New habit: Use Object.assign instead.  Use Spread Syntax When Creating a New Object Based on an  Existing Object’s Properties  Old habit: Using a custom extend or Object.assign to create a new object based on an existing  object’s properties:  const s1 = {a: 1, b: 2}; const s2 = {a: "updated", c: 3}; const dest = Object.assign {}, s1, s2 ; console.log dest ;    {"a": "updated", "b": 2, "c": 3}  New habit: Use property spread syntax:  const s1 = {a: 1, b: 2}; const s2 = {a: "updated", c: 3}; const dest = {...s1, ...s2}; console.log dest ;    {"a": "updated", "b": 2, "c": 3}  Use Symbol to Avoid Name Collision  Old habit: Using obscure string names for properties in an attempt to avoid colliding with names  outside your control.  New habit: Use Symbols for those instead.  Use Object.getPrototypeOf setPrototypeOf Instead  of __proto__  Old habit: Getting or setting the prototype of an object via the previously non-standard extension  __proto__.  New habit: Use the standard Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf instead  even  though __proto__ is now standardized on web browsers .   Use Method Syntax for Methods  Old habit: Using a property initializer for functions that you intend to be methods of the object:  130  ❘  CHAPTER 5    New Object Features  const obj = {     example: function   {            ...     } };  New habit: Use method syntax instead:  const obj = {     example   {            ...     } };  Just remember that if you use super, the method will have a link to its original object, so if you copy  it to another object, it will continue to use the prototype of its original object, not the new one. If you  don’t use super  and don’t use eval , a good JavaScript engine will optimize that link away.

JavaScript got a new feature in ES2015: generalized iteration, the classic “for each” idiom popu- lar in many languages. In this chapter you’ll learn about the new feature’s iterators and iterables  and how you create and use them. You’ll also learn about JavaScript’s powerful new genera- tors that make creating iterators easy, and also take the concept further, making communica- tion two-way.  ITERATORS, ITERABLES, THE FOR-OF LOOP, AND ITERABLE  SPREAD SYNTAX  In this section, you’ll learn about JavaScript’s new iterators and iterables, the for-of loop that  makes using iterators easy, and the handy spread syntax  ...  for iterables.   132  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  Iterators and Iterables  Many languages have some kind of “for each” construct for looping through the entries of an array  or list or other collection object. For years, JavaScript only had the for-in loop, which isn’t a  general-purpose tool  it’s just for looping through the properties of an object . The new Iterator and  Iterable “interfaces”  see note  and new language constructs that use them change that.  NOTE  Starting with ES2015, the specification mentions “interfaces”  in the  sense of code interfaces  for the first time. Since JavaScript isn’t strongly typed,  an “interface” is purely a convention. The specification’s description is that an  interface “. . . is a set of property keys whose associated values match a specific  specification. Any object that provides all the properties as described by an inter- face’s specification conforms to that interface. An interface is not represented by  a distinct object. There may be many separately implemented objects that con- form to any interface. An individual object may conform to multiple interfaces.”  An iterator is an object with a next method; each time you call next, it returns the next value  if any   in the sequence it represents, and a flag saying whether it’s done.  An iterable is an object with a standard method for getting an iterator for its contents. All list- or  collection-style objects in the JavaScript standard library are iterable—arrays, strings, typed arrays   Chapter 11 , Maps  Chapter 12 , and Sets  Chapter 12 . Plain objects are not iterable by default.  Let’s examine the basics.  The for-of Loop: Using an Iterator Implicitly  You can get and use the iterator directly, but it’s more common to use it indirectly, for instance by  using the new for-of loop. for-of gets an iterator from the iterable and uses it to loop through the  iterable’s contents.  NOTE  for-of isn’t the only language feature that you can use to implic- itly use iterators. There are several new features that use iterables under the  covers, including: iterable spread syntax  later in this chapter ; destructuring   Chapter 7 ; Promise.all  Chapter 8 ; Array.from  Chapter 11 , and Maps and  Sets  Chapter 12 .  Arrays are iterable, so let’s look at looping through an array with for-of:  const a = ["a", "b", "c"]; for  const value of a  {     console.log value ; }    =>    "a"   Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  133     "b"    "c"  Running that code shows "a", then "b", then "c": the for-of statement gets an iterator from the  array behind the scenes, then uses it to loop through the values, making each value available as value  within the loop body.  Note that for-of is different from for-in. If you use for-in on that array, you get "0", then "1",  then "2"—the names of the properties for the array’s entries. for-of provides the values of the  entries, as defined by the array’s iterator. This also means that for-of will only give you values of  the array’s entries, not the values of any other properties you may have added to it  since arrays are  objects . Compare:  const a = ["a", "b", "c"]; a.extra = "extra property"; for  const value of a  {     console.log value ; }    The above produces "a", "b", and "c"   for  const key in a  {     console.log key ; }    The above produces "0", "1", "2", and "extra"  Did you notice the const value in the examples so far? You’ll remember from Chapter 2 that when  you declare a variable in a for loop with let, a new variable is created for each iteration of the loop.  That’s true in a for-of or for-in loop as well. But in for-of for-in, since the variable’s value is  never modified by the loop statement,1 you can declare it with const if you like.  let or var would  also be fine, with the usual caveats on the scope of var. If you want to change the value in the loop  body, use let.   for-of is very convenient and you’ll use it a lot. But because it does everything for you, it doesn’t  help you understand the details of iterators much. How does it get the iterator? How does it use it?  Let’s look more closely. . .  Using an Iterator Explicitly  Suppose you wanted to use the iterator explicitly. You’d do that like this:  const a = ["a", "b", "c"]; const it = a[Symbol.iterator]  ;    Step 1 let result = it.next  ;             Step 2 while  !result.done  {              Step 3.a     console.log result.value ;      Step 3.b     result = it.next  ;             Step 3.c }  1  Whereas in a for loop, you may recall that the control variable is modified during a loop iteration: specifically, at the  beginning of the second iteration onward. See “Block Scope in Loops” in Chapter 2, specifically the detailed series of  steps in the “Bindings: How Variables, Constants, and Other Identifiers Work” subsection.   134  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  Let’s look at each step of that.  Step 1 gets an iterator from the array. Iterables provide a method for this whose name is the well- known Symbol Symbol.iterator  you learned about well-known Symbols in Chapter 5 . You call  that method to get the iterator:  const it = a[Symbol.iterator]  ;  Step 2 calls the iterator’s next function to get a result object. A result object is an object conforming  to the IteratorResult interface, which essentially means it has a done property indicating whether the  iterator is done iterating, and a value property containing the value for the current iteration:  let result = it.next  ;  Step 3 performs the loop, using a series of sub-steps.  a  while the done property on the result object  is false  or at least falsy2 , it  b  uses the value, then  c  calls next again:  while  !result.done  {              Step 3.a     console.log result.value ;      Step 3.b     result = it.next  ;             Step 3.c }  NOTE  The symbols used for iteration  Symbol.iterator and another you’ll  learn about in Chapter 9  are global Symbols  see Chapter 5 , so iteration works  across realms.  You’ve probably noted that coding the result = it.next   call in two places introduces a minor  code maintenance hazard. That’s one reason to use for-of or other automatic constructs where pos- sible. But you could also do the call in the while loop’s condition expression:  const a = ["a", "b", "c"]; const it = a[Symbol.iterator]  ; let result; while  ! result = it.next   .done  {     console.log result.value ; }  Now it’s in just one place.  Although a result object is defined as having a done property and a value property, done is optional  if its value would be false, and value is optional if its value would be undefined.   Those are the basic steps of using an iterator.  2  Recall that falsy values are considered false when used as booleans. The falsy values are 0, NaN, "",   undefined, null, and of course, false; all other values are truthy.  Well...on browsers there’s also   document.all; you’ll learn about its odd falsiness in Chapter 17.    Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  135  Stopping Iteration Early  When you’re using an iterator, you may have reason to stop early. For instance, if you’re searching  through an iterator’s sequence for something, you’d probably stop when you found it. But if you  just stop calling next, the iterator doesn’t know you’re done with it. It may well be holding onto  resources it could let go of if you’re done with it. It will let go of them eventually anyway when it gets  garbage collected  unless they’re something that garbage collection doesn’t handle , but iterators have  a way to be more proactive: an optional method called return. It tells the iterator you’re done with  it, and that it should clean up any resources it would normally clean up once it had reached the end  of the sequence.  Since it’s optional, you need to test for it before you call it. Here’s an example:  const a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]; const it = a[Symbol.iterator]  ; let result; while  ! result = it.next   .done  {     if  result.value === "c"  {         if  it.return  {             it.return  ;         }         break;     } }   In Chapter 19 you’ll learn about optional chaining, which would let you write that more concisely.  Instead of the if, you could just write it.return?.  ; See that chapter for details.   The specification says that return must return a result object  like next does  which “typically” has  done set to true, and that if you pass an argument into return, the result object’s value should  “typically” be that argument’s value, but it also says that requirement is not enforced  and later you’ll  see ways to break it . Consequently, you probably don’t want to count on either behavior. Iterators  provided by the JavaScript runtime itself will behave that way if they have a return, but you can’t  count on iterators from third-party libraries doing so.  You may be wondering how you call return on the iterator if you’re using for-of, since you don’t  have an explicit reference to the iterator:  const a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]; for  const value of a  {     if  value === "c"  {         if  ???.return  {             ???.return  ;         }         break;     } }  const a = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]; for  const value of a  {  The answer is: you don’t have to, because for-of does it for you when you exit the loop without  completing it  that is, by using break, or by returning, or throwing an error . So you don’t have to  worry about it at all:   136  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators      if  value === "c"  {         break;    This is just fine, it calls the iterator's `return`     } }  There’s a second optional method: throw. You won’t normally use it with simple iterators, and   for-of never calls it  even if you throw an error from the body of the for-of . You’ll learn about  throw later in this chapter where you learn about generator functions.  Iterator Prototype Objects  All iterator objects provided by the JavaScript runtime inherit from a prototype object providing   the appropriate next method for the iterable you got it from. For instance, array iterators inherit  from an array iterator prototype object, which provides the appropriate next method for arrays.   That array iterator prototype is known in the specification as %ArrayIteratorPrototype%. String  iterators inherit from %StringIteratorPrototype%, Map  Chapter 12  iterators inherit from  %MapIteratorPrototype%, etc.  NOTE  There are no publicly defined globals or properties that provide direct  references to these in the standard runtime, but you can easily get a reference to  one by using Object.getPrototypeOf on an iterator of the type you want, such  as an array iterator.  All of these iterator prototypes have an underlying prototype, which the spec creatively calls   %IteratorPrototype%. It defines just one property, and the property it defines may seem a bit odd,  since it isn’t part of the Iterator interface. It defines a Symbol.iterator method that returns this;  effectively:  const iteratorPrototype = {     This name is conceptual, not actual      [Symbol.iterator]   {         return this;     } };  You’re probably thinking, “But wait, isn’t that for iterables? Why would you have it on an iterator  instead?!”  The answers are: “Yes,” and, “So that they’re also iterable.” Making an iterator iterable makes it  possible to pass the iterator to for-of or other constructs expecting an iterable. For instance, if  you wanted to loop over all entries but the first in an array without using slice to get a subset of  the array:  const a = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]; const it = a[Symbol.iterator]  ; it.next  ; for  const value of it  {     console.log value ; }   Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  137     =>    "two"    "three"    "four"  You’ll learn more about that in the “Iterable Iterators” section later in this chapter, but I wanted to  explain the seemingly odd method provided by %IteratorPrototype%.  Mostly, you won’t need to care about these prototype objects. However, there are at least two situa- tions where you might want to access these prototypes:  1.  2.   If you want to add functionality to the iterators  If you were implementing an iterator manually  see the next section , which you typi- cally won’t do  You’ll see 2 in the next section. Let’s look at 1: adding functionality.  Before we do, note that all the usual caveats about modifying the prototypes of built-in objects apply: A.  Ensure that any properties methods you add are non-enumerable. B.  Ensure that they have names that are unlikely to conflict with features that may be added in   the future. You might consider using Symbols.  C.   In the vast majority of cases, library code  rather than application or page-specific code   should avoid prototype modifications entirely.  With all of that said, let’s add a method to all iterators  or at least, ones inheriting from   %IteratorPrototype% : finding the first entry that matches a condition, like the find method on  arrays. We won’t call it find, because that would violate caveat  B , so we’ll call it myFind. Just like  the find on arrays, it’ll accept a callback and optional argument to use as this when calling the call- back, and return the first result object for which the callback returns a truthy value, or the last result  object  which will have done = true  if it never does.  To add a method to %IteratorPrototype%, first we have to get a reference to it. There’s no public  global or property that refers directly to it, but we know from the specification that the prototype of  an array iterator is %ArrayIteratorPrototype%, and we know  also from the spec  that its proto- type is %IteratorPrototype%. So we can get %IteratorPrototype% by creating an array, getting an  iterator for it, and getting its prototype’s prototype:  const iteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf      Object.getPrototypeOf [][Symbol.iterator]     ;  The specification even has a note saying exactly that.  Now that we have a reference to it, we can add our method to it. Normally, methods on prototypes  are non-enumerable, but are writable and configurable, so we’ll use Object.defineProperty.  The method itself is quite simple: call next until the callback returns a truthy value, or we run out  of values.  Object.defineProperty iteratorPrototype, "myFind", {     value callback, thisArg  {   Run the code in Listing 6-1 to see it in action. Once the new method is defined, the example uses it to  find entries in an array of strings that have the letter “e” in them.  138  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators          let result;         while  ! result = this.next   .done  {             if  callback.call thisArg, result.value   {                 break;             }         }         return result;     },     writable: true,     configurable: true } ;  LISTING 6-1:  Adding myFind to Iterators—adding-myFind.js     Adding it const iteratorPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf      Object.getPrototypeOf [][Symbol.iterator]     ; Object.defineProperty iteratorPrototype, "myFind", {     value callback, thisArg  {         let result;         while  ! result = this.next   .done  {             if  callback.call thisArg, result.value   {                 break;             }         }         return result;     },     writable: true,     configurable: true } ;      Using it const a = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]; const it = a[Symbol.iterator]  ; let result; while  ! result = it.myFind v => v.includes "e"   .done  {     console.log "Found: " + result.value ; } console.log "Done" ;  An extension like this is only useful when the iterator is being used explicitly, though. Later when you  learn about generator functions, you’ll learn a simpler way to do this.  Making Something Iterable  You’ve seen that you get an iterator by calling an iterable’s Symbol.iterator method. And you’ve  seen that an iterator is an object with, at minimum, a next method that returns the “next”   result object with value and done. To make something iterable, you simply provide that   Symbol.iterator method.   Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  139  Let’s create a pseudo-array with just a plain object:  const a = {     0: "a",     1: "b",     2: "c",     length: 3 };  That object is not iterable, because plain objects by default are not iterable:  for  const value of a  {    TypeError: a is not iterable     console.log value ; }  To make it iterable, you need to add a function as its Symbol.iterator property:  a[Symbol.iterator] =  * function goes here * ;  ERRORS WHEN THINGS AREN’T ITERABLE  On most JavaScript engines now, when you try to use an object that isn’t   iterable where an iterable object is expected, you get a fairly clear error, “x is not  iterable” or similar. But on some engines, it may not be quite so clear: “undefined  is not a function.” This happens when the JavaScript engine doesn’t have special  handling for this situation, because it looks up Symbol.iterator on the object and  tries to call the resulting value; if the object doesn’t have a Symbol.iterator  property, the result of looking it up is undefined, and when you try to call   undefined as a function, you get that error. Thankfully, most engines add special  handling to make it clearer now.  The next step is to write the function, having it return an iterator object. Later in this chapter you’ll  learn about generator functions, which you’ll probably use most of the time to implement iterators.  But since generator functions do most of the work for you, they hide some of the details, so let’s do it  manually first.  As a first approach, you’d probably implement the iterator for this pseudo-array object something  like this:     Take 1 a[Symbol.iterator] = function   {     let index = 0;     return {         next:    => {             if  index < this.length  {                 return {value: this[index++], done: false};             }             return {value: undefined, done: true};         }     }; };   140  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators   Note that next is an arrow function. It’s important that it uses the this that the   Symbol.iterator method was called with, regardless of how it’s called, so that this refers to the  pseudo-array. Alternatively, you could use method syntax and use a rather than this in both places  it’s used, since next closes over a in this example. But if you were doing this on a class and needed to  access instance information like length, you wouldn’t usually have anything but this to close over,  so an arrow function makes sense.   That version is okay, but it doesn’t make the iterator inherit from %IteratorPrototype%, like all  iterators you get from the JavaScript runtime do. So if you add to %IteratorPrototype% as we did  earlier with myFind, this iterator won’t have the addition. It also doesn’t inherit the prototype prop- erty that makes iterators iterable. Let’s make it inherit from %IteratorPrototype%:     Take 2 a[Symbol.iterator] = function   {     let index = 0;     const itPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf          Object.getPrototypeOf [][Symbol.iterator]         ;     const it = Object.assign Object.create itPrototype , {         next:    => {             if  index < this.length  {                 return {value: this[index++], done: false};             }             return {value: undefined, done: true};         }     } ;     return it; };  If you write these manual iterators a lot, you’ll probably want a reusable function to do most of that  for you which you just pass your next implementation into. But again, you’ll probably use generator  functions instead.  We’ll get to that section soon, really.   Try running the code in Listing 6-2.  LISTING 6-2:  Basic iterable example—basic-iterable-example.js     Basic iterator example when not using a generator function const a = {     0: "a",     1: "b",     2: "c",     length: 3,     [Symbol.iterator]   {         let index = 0;         const itPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf              Object.getPrototypeOf [][Symbol.iterator]             ;         const it = Object.assign Object.create itPrototype , {             next:    => {                 if  index < this.length  {                     return {value: this[index++], done: false};                 }   Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  141                  return {value: undefined, done: true};             }         } ;         return it;     } }; for  const value of a  {     console.log value ; }  That example is just for a single object, but often you’ll want to define a class of objects that are  all iterable. The typical way to do that is by putting the Symbol.iterator function on a prototype  object that the class of objects uses. Let’s look at an example using the class syntax you learned in  Chapter 4: a very simple LinkedList class that’s iterable. See Listing 6-3.  LISTING 6-3:  Iterator on a class—iterator-on-class.js     Basic iterator example on a class when not using a generator function class LinkedList {     constructor   {         this.head = this.tail = null;     }       add value  {         const entry = {value, next: null};         if  !this.tail  {             this.head = this.tail = entry;         } else {             this.tail = this.tail.next = entry;         }     }       [Symbol.iterator]   {         let current = this.head;         const itPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf              Object.getPrototypeOf [][Symbol.iterator]             ;         const it = Object.assign Object.create itPrototype , {             next   {                 if  current  {                     const value = current.value;                     current = current.next;                     return {value, done: false};                 }                 return {value: undefined, done: true};             }         } ;         return it;     } }   const list = new LinkedList  ; list.add "one" ;  continues   142  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  LISTING 6-3   continued   list.add "two" ; list.add "three" ;   for  const value of list  {     console.log value ; }  It’s fundamentally the same as the previous iterator implementation; it’s just defined on the prototype  rather than directly on the object. Also, since next doesn’t use this  unlike the pseudo-array exam- ple, this doesn’t need any instance-specific information; each node links to the next , it can be defined  using method syntax rather than as a property referring to an arrow function.  Iterable Iterators  Earlier you learned that all iterators inheriting from %IteratorPrototype% are also iterable, because  %IteratorPrototype% provides a Symbol.iterator method that does return this—simply  returning the iterator it was called on. There are various reasons to make iterators iterable:  As described earlier, you might want to skip or specially handle an entry or some entries, then process  the rest with a for-of loop or other mechanism that consumes an iterable  rather than an iterator .  Or suppose you want to provide an iterator without any iterable object, for instance as the return  value of a function. The caller may want to use for-of or similar on it. Making it iterable lets  them do that.  Here’s an example of a function returning an iterator that’s also iterable. The iterator provides  the parent of the DOM element we pass it  and then that parent’s parent, etc., until it runs out  of parents :     Example that doesn't inherit from %IteratorPrototype%  if it did,    we wouldn't need to implement the [Symbol.iterator] function  function parents element  {     return {         next   {             element = element && element.parentNode;             if  element && element.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE  {                 return {value: element};             }             return {done: true};         },            Makes this iterator an iterable         [Symbol.iterator]   {             return this;         }     }; }  You wouldn’t really write the function like that, of course, because firstly, you’d probably write a  generator function instead  we’ll get there, I promise! , and secondly, even if you didn’t, you’d have  the iterator inherit from %IteratorPrototype% instead of implementing Symbol.iterator yourself.  But try it out with the page in Listing 6-4. Then, try modifying it to make the iterator inherit from  %IteratorPrototype% instead of implementing the Symbol.iterator method yourself.   Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  143  LISTING 6-4:  Iterable iterator example—iterable-iterator-example.html           Iterable Iterator Example                       Look in the console for the output                 Not really how you'd write this, but shows how implementing the Symbol.iterator    method makes it possible to use an iterator with `for-of` function parents element  {     return {         next   {             element = element && element.parentNode;             if  element && element.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE  {                 return {value: element};             }             return {done: true};         },            Makes this iterator an iterable         [Symbol.iterator]   {             return this;         }     }; } for  const parent of parents document.getElementById "target"    {     console.log parent.tagName ; }        Iterable Spread Syntax  Iterable spread syntax provides a way to consume an iterable by spreading out its result values as  discrete values when calling a function or creating an array.  In Chapter 5 you learned about another  kind of spread, property spread syntax, which is similar but different, and only used in object literals.   Spread syntax for arrays and other iterables was introduced in ES2015. Let’s look at an example:  finding the lowest number in an array of numbers. You could write a loop to do it, but you know that  Math.min accepts a variable number of arguments and returns the lowest of them. For example:  console.log Math.min 27, 14, 12, 64  ;    12  So you could use that if you had discrete numbers to pass in. But if you have an array of numbers:     ES5 var a = [27, 14, 12, 64];   144  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  then how do you supply them to Math.min as discrete arguments? The old pre-ES2015 way was to  use Function.prototype.apply. It was long-winded and odd-looking:     ES5 var a = [27, 14, 12, 64]; console.log Math.min.apply Math, a  ;    12  const a = [27, 14, 12, 64]; console.log Math.min ...a  ;    12  With spread syntax, though, you can spread out the array as discrete arguments instead:  As you can see, spread uses the ellipsis  three dots in a row, like the rest parameter you learned about  in Chapter 3 and property spread you learned about in Chapter 5 .  You can use spread syntax anywhere in the argument list. For instance, if you had two numbers in  individual variables as well as the list of numbers in the array:  const num1 = 16; const num2 = 50; const a = [27, 14, 12, 64];  and you wanted to get the minimum value of all of them, you could do any of these:  console.log Math.min num1, num2, ...a  ;    Math.min 16, 50, 27, 14, 12, 64  == 12 console.log Math.min num1, ...a, num2  ;    Math.min 16, 27, 14, 12, 64, 50  == 12 console.log Math.min ...a, num1, num2  ;    Math.min 27, 14, 12, 64, 16, 50  == 12  Where you put the spread changes the order of the arguments passed to Math.max. It happens that  Math.max doesn’t care about the order, but other functions that accept variable parameter lists may  well care  for instance, the push method of arrays pushes the arguments you give it into the array in  the order you give them .  The other use of iterable spread syntax is expanding an array  or other iterable  inside an  array literal:  const defaultItems = ["a", "b", "c"]; function example items  {     const allItems = [...items, ...defaultItems];     console.log allItems ; } example [1, 2, 3] ;    1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c"  Note that, again, order matters. If you put defaultItems first, then items, you’d get a differ- ent result:  const defaultItems = ["a", "b", "c"]; function example items  {     const allItems = [...defaultItems, ...items];     console.log allItems ; } example [1, 2, 3] ;    "a", "b", "c", 1, 2, 3  Iterators, for-of, and the DOM  The majority use of JavaScript is, of course, on web browsers or applications built with web technolo- gies. The DOM has various collection objects, such as the NodeList returned by querySelectorAll    Iterators, Iterables, the for-of Loop, and Iterable Spread Syntax  ❘  145  or the older HTMLCollection returned by getElementsByTagName and other older methods. You’re  probably wondering, “Can I use for-of on those? Are they iterable?”  NodeList is on modern, cutting-edge browsers  up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari , and  HTMLCollection is too on all of those except the pre-Chromium version of Edge. The WHAT-WG  DOM specification marks NodeList as iterable, but not HTMLCollection, so the old version of Edge  is in line with the specification while the others add this feature to HTMLCollection despite it not  being specified.  Listing 6-5 shows a  silly  example iterating through a NodeList from querySelectorAll.  LISTING 6-5:  Looping through DOM collection—looping-dom-collections.html           Looping DOM Collections            Lorem  ipsum  dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing     elit, sed do eiusmod  tempor  incididunt ut      labore  et dolore  magna       aliqua .     for  const span of document.querySelectorAll "span.cap"   {     span.textContent = span.textContent.toUpperCase  ; }        You probably don’t need to convert DOM collections to arrays nearly as much now as you had to in  the past. For instance, you used to have to convert a DOM collection to an array to use forEach on  it; on modern browsers, that’s no longer necessary, because the collections have forEach now. But  if you have a specific need for an array  perhaps you want to use some advanced array methods ,  you can use iterable spread to convert the DOM collection to one. This converts a NodeList into an  array, for instance:  const niftyLinkArray = [...document.querySelectorAll "div.nifty > a" ];  If you’re transpiling for use on older browsers, you’ll probably need a polyfill to make iteration work  for arrays, and that’s true for DOM collections as well. Typically, the transpiler you’re using will offer  polyfills for iteration for Array.prototype at least, and possibly NodeList.prototype as well.   They may be optional ones you need to specifically enable. If your preferred polyfill only handles  Array.prototype and not the DOM collections, you can apply the Array.prototype one to the  DOM collections.  The same with Array.prototype.forEach.  See Listing 6-6.  It’s written in ES5  so it can be used directly even in older environments. You’d include it in your bundle after any poly- fills you’re using.  But double-check first that the tool you’re using doesn’t handle these for you; it’s  generally better to use curated polyfills rather than rolling your own.   146  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  LISTING 6-6:  Applying Array.prototype iterator to DOM collections—  polyfill-dom-collections.js  ; function   {     if  Object.defineProperty  {         var iterator = typeof Symbol !== "undefined" &&                     Symbol.iterator &&                     Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator];         var forEach = Array.prototype.forEach;         var update = function collection  {             var proto = collection && collection.prototype;             if  proto  {                 if  iterator && !proto[Symbol.iterator]  {                     Object.defineProperty proto, Symbol.iterator, {                         value: iterator,                         writable: true,                         configurable: true                     } ;                 }                 if  forEach && !proto.forEach  {                     Object.defineProperty proto, "forEach", {                         value: forEach,                         writable: true,                         configurable: true                     } ;                 }             }         };           if  typeof NodeList !== "undefined"  {             update NodeList ;         }         if  typeof HTMLCollection !== "undefined"  {             update HTMLCollection ;         }     } }   ;  GENERATOR FUNCTIONS  Generator functions are, at heart, functions that can seemingly pause in the middle of what they’re  doing, produce a value, optionally accept a new value, and then keep going—repeatedly, as often as  necessary  forever, if you like . This makes them very powerful, and seemingly complex at first, but in  fact they’re quite simple.  They don’t really pause in the middle. Under the covers, generator functions create and return genera- tor objects. Generator objects are iterators but with a two-way information flow. Where iterators only  produce values, generators can both produce and consume values.  You could create a generator object manually, but generator functions provide syntax to markedly  simplify the process  just like for-of simplifies the process of using an iterator .   Generator Functions  ❘  147  A Basic Generator Function Just Producing Values  We’ll start with a very basic generator function with only a one-way flow of information: producing  values. See Listing 6-7.  LISTING 6-7:  Basic generator example—basic-generator-example.js  function* simple   {     for  let n = 1; n <= 3; ++n  {         yield n;     } } for  const value of simple    {     console.log value ; }  When you run Listing 6-7, it shows the numbers 1 through 3 in the console:  1.  The code calls simple, getting a generator object, then gives that object to for-of. 2.   for-of asks the generator object for an iterator. The generator object returns itself as the  iterator  generator objects inherit indirectly from %IteratorPrototype% and so they have  the “return this” Symbol.iterator method it provides .  3.   for-of uses the generator object’s next method to get the values in the loop and pass each of  them to console.log.  There are some new things in that code.  First, note the * after the function keyword. That’s what makes it a generator function. You can  have whitespace after function and before the * if you like, it’s purely a matter of style.  Second, note the new keyword yield. It marks where a generator function seemingly pauses and   then resumes. The value you put after it  if any  is the value the generator produces at that point.   So in Listing 6-7, the yield n; produces 1, then 2, then 3, and then it’s done. The code using the  generator sees those via the for-of  because generators are also iterators .  CONTEXT-SENSITIVE KEYWORDS  Several of the new features being added to JavaScript involve new keywords, like  yield. But like yield, many of these new keywords haven’t always been reserved  words in JavaScript and may have been used as identifiers  variable names and such   in existing code. So how can they suddenly become keywords without breaking that  existing code?  This is done in a couple of different ways, but what they have in common is that the  new keyword is only a keyword in contexts where it couldn’t have appeared before;  in contexts where it could have appeared before, it isn’t a keyword and code can use  it as an identifier.  continues   148  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  continued One way this is done is by defining the new keyword only in a location where an  identifier would be a syntax error; by definition, that means there’s no existing,  working code that would be broken by the change.  You’ll see an example of this in  Chapter 9: async is a keyword when it’s just before function; before it was added,  async function was a syntax error just like foo function still is.   Another way this is done is by defining the new keyword only within a structure that  didn’t exist before. Since it didn’t exist before, there can’t be any existing code using  an identifier there. That’s how yield works: it’s only a keyword within a generator  function, and generator functions are new; before generator functions were added,  function* was a syntax error. Outside of a generator function, yield can be used  as an identifier.  Using Generator Functions to Create Iterators  Since generator functions create generators, and generators are a form of iterator, you can use genera- tor function syntax to write your own iterator—and doing so is much simpler and more concise than  all of that code you saw earlier creating the iterator object with the right prototype and implementing  the next method. Let’s look again at the earlier implementation of an example iterator; see List- ing 6-8  which repeats Listing 6-2 from earlier .  LISTING 6-8:  Basic iterable example  again —basic-iterable-example.js     Basic iterator example when not using a generator function const a = {     0: "a",     1: "b",     2: "c",     length: 3,     [Symbol.iterator]   {         let index = 0;         const itPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf              Object.getPrototypeOf [][Symbol.iterator]             ;         const it = Object.assign Object.create itPrototype , {             next:    => {                 if  index < this.length  {                     return {value: this[index++], done: false};                 }                 return {value: undefined, done: true};             }         } ;         return it;     } }; for  const value of a  {     console.log value ; }  Compare that to Listing 6-9, which does the same thing with a generator function.   Generator Functions  ❘  149  LISTING 6-9:  Basic iterable example using generator—iterable-using-generator-example.js  const a = {     0: "a",     1: "b",     2: "c",     length: 3,        The next example shows a simpler way to write the next line     [Symbol.iterator]: function*   {         for  let index = 0; index < this.length; ++index  {             yield this[index];         }     } }; for  const value of a  {     console.log value ; }  Much simpler, much clearer  once you know what yield means . The generator function does all the  heavy lifting for you. You write the logic rather than worrying about the plumbing details.  That example uses property definition syntax:  [Symbol.iterator]: function*   {  but it could have used method syntax as well, since generator functions can be methods. Let’s look at  that . . .  Generator Functions As Methods  Generator functions can be methods, with all the features of methods  such as being able to use  super . Earlier you saw an example of a very simple iterable LinkedList class, with a manually  implemented iterator. Let’s revisit that class implementing the iterator with a generator function  instead, using method syntax. See Listing 6-10.  LISTING 6-10:  Class with generator method for iterator—generator-method-example.js  class LinkedList {     constructor   {         this.head = this.tail = null;     }       add value  {         const entry = {value, next: null};         if  !this.tail  {             this.head = this.tail = entry;         } else {             this.tail = this.tail.next = entry;         }     }    continues   150  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  LISTING 6-10   continued       *[Symbol.iterator]   {         for  let current = this.head; current; current = current.next  {             yield current.value;         }     } }   const list = new LinkedList  ; list.add "one" ; list.add "two" ; list.add "three" ;   for  const value of list  {     console.log value ; }  Notice how the generator method is declared: you put an asterisk  *  in front of the method name,  just like the asterisk in front of the function name after the keyword function.  In this example the  method name is using the computed name syntax you learned about in Chapter 4, but it could be  a simple name if we weren’t defining a Symbol-named method.  This mirrors the syntax of getter  and setter method declarations, using * where get or set would be. Also notice how much simpler,  clearer, and more concise the generator version is than the manually coded one.  Using a Generator Directly  So far you’ve seen consuming the values from generators via for-of, as though they were just itera- tors. Like iterators, you can use the generator directly as well; see Listing 6-11.  LISTING 6-11:  Basic generator used directly—basic-generator-used-directly.js  function* simple   {     for  let n = 1; n <= 3; ++n  {         yield n;     } } const g = simple  ; let result; while  ! result = g.next   .done  {     console.log result.value ; }  That code gets the generator object  g  from the generator function  simple , then uses it exactly  the way you saw iterators used before  since generators are iterators . That isn’t very exciting, but it  becomes much more interesting when you start passing values to the generator rather than just taking  values from it, as you’ll learn in the next section.   Generator Functions  ❘  151  Consuming Values with Generators  Up until now, all of the generators you’ve seen in this chapter only produced values, by providing an  operand to yield. This is really useful for writing iterators and never-ending sequences like Fibonacci  numbers and such, but generators have another trick up their sleeve: they can consume values, too.  The result of the yield operator is the value pushed to the generator, the value it can consume.  You can’t push values to generators via for-of, so instead you have to use them directly and pass the  value you want to push to the generator into next when calling it.  Here’s a really simple example: a generator that sums two numbers pushed to it. See Listing 6-12.  LISTING 6-12:  Basic two-way generator—basic-two-way-generator-example.js  function* add   {     console.log "starting" ;     const value1 = yield "Please provide value 1";     console.log "value1 is " + value1 ;     const value2 = yield "Please provide value 2";     console.log "value2 is " + value2 ;     return value1 + value2; }   let result; const gen = add  ; result = gen.next  ;       "starting" console.log result ;       {value: "Please provide value 1", done: false} result = gen.next 35 ;     "value1 is 35" console.log result ;       {value: "Please provide value 2", done: false} result = gen.next 7 ;      "value2 is 7" console.log result ;       {value: 42, done: true}  Let’s follow Listing 6-12 through in detail:  1.   2.   const gen = add   calls the generator function and stores the generator object it returns in  the gen constant. None of the logic inside the generator function has run yet—the “starting”  line does not appear in the log.  gen.next   runs the generator code up until the first yield. The "starting" line is output,  then the operand of the first yield, "Please provide value 1", is evaluated and provided  by the generator to the caller.  3.  That value is received by the calling code in the first result object, which is stored in result. 4.   console.log result  shows the first result: {value: "Please provide value 1",  done: false}.  5.   gen.next 35  sends the value 35 to the generator.   152  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  6.  The generator code continues: that value  35  becomes the result of the yield.  That’s the  generator consuming the value passed to it.  The code assigns that value to value1, logs it,  and produces  yields  the value "Please provide value 2".  7.  The calling code receives that value on the next result object, and logs that new result object:   {value: "Please provide value 2", done: false}.  gen.next 7  sends the value 7 to the generator.  8.  9.  The generator code continues: that value  7  becomes the result of yield. The code assigns it   to value2, logs the value, and returns the sum of value1 and value2.  10.  The calling code receives the result object, saves it in result, and logs it. Note that this time,  value is the sum  42 , and done is true. It’s true because the generator returned that value,  rather than yielding it.  This example is obviously extremely basic, but it demonstrates how the logic in the generator func- tion seemingly pauses, waiting for the next input from the code using the generator.  Notice that in that example, the first call to gen.next   doesn’t have any argument. In fact, if you  put an argument there, the generator never sees it. That first call to next advances the generator from  the beginning of the function to the first yield, then returns a result object with the value that the  first yield produces. Since generator function code receives values from next as the result of yield,  there’s no way for them to receive a value passed in that first call to next. To provide initial input to  the generator, pass an argument in the generator function’s arguments list, rather than to the first call  to next.  In the example, to give add a value right at the outset, you’d pass it into add rather than  passing it to the first call to next.   The very basic example you’ve seen so far doesn’t have the generator’s logic depend on the values  pushed to it, but often those values will be used for branching within the generator. Listing 6-13  shows an example of that; run it in a browser.

It’s  a state machine, but it’s written using the same logical flow syntax you use in other JavaScript code.  It’s common for generators to involve loops, sometimes endless loops. See Listing 6-14, which shows  a “keep a running sum of the last three inputs” generator.  LISTING 6-14:  “Sum of last three” generator—sum-of-last-three-generator.js  function* sumThree   {     const lastThree = [];     let sum = 0;     while  true  {         const value = yield sum;         lastThree.push value ;         sum += value;         if  lastThree.length > 3  {             sum -= lastThree.shift  ;         }     } }   const it = sumThree  ; console.log it.next  .value ;     0   there haven't been any values passed in yet  console.log it.next 1 .value ;    1   1  console.log it.next 7 .value ;    8   1 + 7  console.log it.next 4 .value ;    12  1 + 7 + 4  console.log it.next 2 .value ;    13  7 + 4 + 2; 1 "fell off"  console.log it.next 3 .value ;    9   4 + 2 + 3; 7 "fell off"    Generator Functions  ❘  155  The generator in Listing 6-14 keeps track of the last three values you feed it, returning an updated  sum of those last three each time you call it. When you’re using it, you don’t have to keep track of the  values yourself or worry about the logic of maintaining the running sum, including subtracting values  from it when they drop off; you just push values to it and use the sum it produces.  Using return in a Generator Function  As you saw briefly earlier, the generator created by a generator function does an interesting thing  when you use the return statement with a return value: it produces a result object that has the return  value and done = true. Here’s an example:  function* usingReturn   {     yield 1;     yield 2;     return 3; } console.log "Using for-of:" ; for  const value of usingReturn    {     console.log value ; }    =>    1    2 console.log "Using the generator directly:" ; const g = usingReturn  ; let result; while  ! result = g.next   .done  {     console.log result ; }    =>    {value: 1, done: false}    {value: 2, done: false} console.log result ;    =>    {value: 3, done: true}  There are a couple of things to notice there:  ➤➤ for-of doesn’t see the value on the done = true result object, because like the while   loops you’ve seen, it checks done and exits without looking at value.  ➤➤ The final console.log result ; shows the return value along with done = true.  The generator only provides the return value once. If you keep calling next even after getting a result  object with done = true, you’ll get result objects with done = true and value = undefined.  Precedence of the yield Operator  The yield operator has very low precedence. That means that as much of the expression following  it as possible is grouped together before yield is done. It’s important to be aware of that, because    156  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  otherwise reasonable-looking code can trip you up. For example, suppose you were consuming a  value in a generator and wanted to use the value in a calculation. This seems okay at first glance:  let a = yield + 2 + 30;    WRONG  It does run, but the results are odd:  function* example   {     let a = yield + 2 + 30;    WRONG     return a; } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;      {value: 32, done: false} console.log gen.next 10  ;    {value: 10, done: true}  The first call just primes the generator  remember that code in generator functions doesn’t see a value  passed to the first call to next . The result of the second call is just the value passed in; it doesn’t  get 2 and 30 added to it. Why? A clue to the answer can be found in the first call’s result, which has  value = 32.  Remember that the expression to the right of yield is its operand, which is evaluated and becomes  the value from next. That line is really doing this:  because the unary + that was in front of the 2 doesn’t do anything to the 2  it’s already a number .  If you tried to use multiplication rather than addition or subtraction there, you’d get a syntax error:  let a = yield  + 2 + 30 ;  which is really just:  let a = yield 2 + 30;  let a = yield * 2 + 30;    ERROR  That happens because there’s no unary * operator.  You might think you’d just move yield to the end:  let a = 2 + 30 + yield;    ERROR  but the JavaScript grammar doesn’t allow that  largely for historical and parsing-complexity reasons .  Instead, the clearest way is just to put it in its own statement:  function* example   {     let x = yield;     let a = x + 2 + 30;     return a; } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;      {value: undefined, done: false} console.log gen.next 10  ;    {value: 42, done: true}  However, if you prefer you can use parentheses around the yield instead, and then use it anywhere  in the expression that makes sense:  function* example   {     let a =  yield  + 2 + 30;   Generator Functions  ❘  157      return a; } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;      {value: undefined, done: false} console.log gen.next 10  ;    {value: 42, done: true}  The return and throw Methods: Terminating a Generator  Generators created by generator functions implement both of the optional methods of the Iterator  interface, return and throw. Using them, code using the generator can, in effect, inject a return  statement or throw statement into the generator function’s logic where the current yield is.  You’ll remember from slightly earlier in this chapter that when a generator issues a return statement,  the calling code sees a result object with both a meaningful value and done = true:  function* example   {     yield 1;     yield 2;     return 3; } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;    {value: 1, done: false} console.log gen.next   ;    {value: 2, done: false} console.log gen.next   ;    {value: 3, done: true}  By using the generator’s return method, the calling code can issue a return that isn’t actually in the  generator function’s code; run Listing 6-15.  LISTING 6-15:  Forced return in a generator—generator-forced-return.js  function* example   {     yield 1;     yield 2;     yield 3; } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;        {value: 1, done: false} console.log gen.return 42  ;    {value: 42, done: true} console.log gen.next   ;        {value: undefined, done: true}  The first call to gen.next   advances the generator to the first yield and produces the value 1. The  gen.return 42  call then forces the generator to return 42, exactly as though it had return 42   in its code where that first yield is  the one where it’s suspended when return is called . And just as  if it had return 42 in its code, the function terminates, so the yield 2 and yield 3 statements are  both skipped. Since the generator has completed, all following calls to next just return a result object  with done = true and value = undefined, as you can see in the last call in Listing 6-15.  The throw method works the same way, injecting a throw instead of a return. Run Listing 6-16.   158  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  LISTING 6-16:  Forced throw in a generator—generator-forced-throw.js  function* example   {     yield 1;     yield 2;     yield 3; } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;                      {value: 1, done: false} console.log gen.throw new Error "boom"   ;    Uncaught Error: boom console.log gen.next   ;                       never executed   This is exactly as though the generator had throw new Error "boom" ; in its logic where the cur- rent yield is.  Just as with the return and throw statements, a generator can use try catch finally to interact  with injected returns and throws. Run Listing 6-17.  LISTING 6-17:  Catching forced throw in a generator—generator-catch-forced-throw.js  function* example   {     let n = 0;     try {         while  true  {             yield n++;         }     } catch  e  {         while  n >= 0  {             yield n--;         }     } } const gen = example  ; console.log gen.next   ;                {value: 0, done: false} console.log gen.next   ;                {value: 1, done: false} console.log gen.throw new Error    ;    {value: 2, done: false} console.log gen.next   ;                {value: 1, done: false} console.log gen.next   ;                {value: 0, done: false} console.log gen.next   ;                {value: undefined, done: true}  Notice how the throw was handled by the generator: it responded by switching from counting up  in  the try block  to counting down  in the catch block . This isn’t particularly useful on its own and isn’t  something you’d want to do without a very strong reason  you’d be better off writing the generator so  you could pass it a value via gen.next   that told the generator to change direction , but can be use- ful when a generator chains to another generator, in the usual way that using try catch can be useful  when calling one function from another. More on generators chaining to each other in the next section.  Yielding a Generator or Iterable: yield*  A generator can pass control to another generator  or any iterable  and then pick up again when that  generator  or iterable  is done by using yield*. Run Listing 6-18.   Generator Functions  ❘  159  LISTING 6-18:  yield* example—yield-star-example.js  function* collect count  {     const data = [];     if  count < 1  Math.floor count  !== count  {         throw new Error "count must be an integer >= 1" ;     }     do {         let msg = "values needed: " + count;         data.push yield msg ;     } while  --count > 0 ;     return data; }   function* outer   {        Have `collect` collect two values:     let data1 = yield* collect 2 ;     console.log "data collected by collect 2  =", data1 ;        Have `collect` collect three values:     let data2 = yield* collect 3 ;     console.log "data collected by collect 3  =", data2 ;        Return an array of results     return [data1, data2]; }   let g = outer  ; let result; console.log "next got:", g.next   ; console.log "next got:", g.next "a"  ; console.log "next got:", g.next "b"  ; console.log "next got:", g.next "c"  ; console.log "next got:", g.next "d"  ; console.log "next got:", g.next "e"  ;  Running Listing 6-18 produces the following output:  next got: { value: "values needed: 2", done: false } next got: { value: "values needed: 1", done: false } data collected by collect 2  = [ "a", "b" ] next got: { value: "values needed: 3", done: false } next got: { value: "values needed: 2", done: false } next got: { value: "values needed: 1", done: false } data collected by collect 3  = [ "c", "d", "e" ] next got: { value: [ [ "a", "b" ], [ "c", "d", "e" ] ], done: true }  When outer yields to collect with yield*, calls you make to the next method of outer’s generator  call next on the generator from collect, producing those values and passing in the ones it con- sumes. For instance, this line in outer:  let data1 = yield* collect 2 ;  translates roughly  but only roughly  to this:     Indicative, but not exactly correct let gen1 = collect 2 ; let result, input;   160  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  while  ! result = gen1.next input  .done  {     input = yield result.value; } let data1 = result.value;  However, in addition to that, the JavaScript runtime ensures that calls to throw and return when  a generator is doing yield* propagate down through the pipeline to the deepest generator iterator  and take effect from there upward.  Whereas with the “indicative” code shown earlier, calling throw  or return on that generator wouldn’t get passed on; it would just take effect in the generator you  called it on.   Listing 6-19 shows an example of using return to terminate an inner generator along with its outer  generator.  LISTING 6-19:  Forwarded return—forwarded-return.js  function* inner   {     try {         let n = 0;         while  true  {             yield "inner " + n++;         }     } finally {         console.log "inner terminated" ;     } } function* outer   {     try {         yield "outer before";         yield* inner  ;         yield "outer after";     } finally {         console.log "outer terminated" ;     } }   const gen = outer  ; let result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: "outer before", done: false} result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: "inner 0", done: false} result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: "inner 1", done: false} result = gen.return 42 ;    "inner terminated"                             "outer terminated" console.log result ;        {value: 42, done: true} result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: undefined, done: true}  Running that, notice how when the generator from outer is using yield* to pass control to the gen- erator from inner, the call to return on the generator from outer is forwarded to the inner genera- tor and takes effect there, as you can see by the console.log in its finally block. But it didn’t just    Generator Functions  ❘  161  cause a return there, it also caused one in the outer generator as well. It’s as though there were a  return 42 in the inner generator, and the outer generator returned the inner’s return value, where the  yields each generator was suspended at were.  The outer generator doesn’t have to stop producing values just because you terminated the   inner one. In the downloads, the file forwarded-return-with-yield.js is just like forwarded-  return.js with this line just above the console.log "outer terminated" ; line:          yield "outer finally";  Run forwarded-return-with-yield.js. It produces slightly different output:  const gen = outer  ; let result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: "outer before", done: false} result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: "inner 0", done: false} result = gen.next  ; console.log result ;        {value: "inner 1", done: false} result = gen.return 42 ;    "inner terminated" console.log result ;        {value: "outer finally", done: false} result = gen.next  ;        "outer terminated" console.log result ;        {value: 42, done: true}  Notice that the gen.return call didn’t return the value that you passed into it  42 . Instead, it  returned the value "outer finally" produced in the outer generator by the new yield and still  has done = false. But later, after the final next call, when the generator is finished it returns a  result object with value = 42 and done = true. It may seem odd that the 42 was retained and then  returned later, but that’s how finally blocks work outside generator functions, too. For example:  function example   {     try {         console.log "a" ;         return 42;     } finally {         console.log "b" ;     } } const result = example  ;    "a"                              "b" console.log result ;         42  function foo   {     try {         return "a";     } finally {         return "b";     } } console.log foo   ;  It’s possible for the generator to return a different value than the one you give in the return method  call. This is, again, like having a return statement. What does this non-generator function return?   162  ❘  CHAPTER 6    Iterables, Iterators, for-of, Iterable spread, Generators  Right! It returns "b", because it overrides the first return with the one in the finally block. This is  generally poor practice, but it is possible. Generator functions can do that too, including overriding  an injected return:  function* foo n  {     try {         while  true  {             n = yield n * 2;         }     } finally {         return "override";      Generally poor practice      } } const gen = foo 2 ; console.log gen.next   ;       { value: 4, done: false } console.log gen.next 3  ;      { value: 6, done: false } console.log gen.return 4  ;    { value: "override", done: true }  Notice that the result object returned from the return had value = "override", not value = 4.  Since yield* forwards these calls to the innermost generator, the inner in Listing 6-19 could do the  same thing. Here’s a pared-down example of that:  function* inner   {     try {         yield "something";     } finally {         return "override";     Generally poor practice      } } function* outer   {     yield* inner  ; } const gen = outer  ; let result = gen.next  ; console.log gen.return 42  ;    {value: "override", done: true}  Notice how the call to return got forwarded from outer’s generator to inner’s. That made inner  effectively issue a return on the yield line, but then that return was overridden by the one in the  finally block. Then, the call to return also made outer return inner’s return value, even though  there’s no code in outer that does that.  Using the throw method in this situation is simpler to understand: it behaves exactly as though the  innermost active generator iterator had used the throw statement. So naturally it propagates up  through the  effective  call stack until unless it’s caught via try catch  or overridden with a return  in a finally block as in the previous example :  function* inner   {     try {         yield "something";         console.log "inner - done" ;     } finally {         console.log "inner - finally" ;     } } function* outer   {     try {   Old Habits to New  ❘  163          yield* inner  ;         console.log "outer - done" ;     } finally {         console.log "outer - finally" ;     } } const gen = outer  ; let result = gen.next  ; result = gen.throw new Error "boom"  ;    inner - finally                                           outer - finally                                           Uncaught Error: "boom"  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Here are some changes to consider making in your coding, subject to your style choices of course.

In this chapter you’ll learn about destructuring, which provides powerful syntax for extracting  values from objects and arrays into variables. You’ll learn how the new syntax helps you access  object and array contents more concisely and or expressively.  OVERVIEW  Destructuring is extracting things from the structure they’re in, in this case with syntax. You’ve  been doing a kind of manual destructuring as long as you’ve been programming  probably  without calling it that! , for instance by taking the value of an object property and putting it in  a variable:  var first = obj.first;    Manual destructuring  That code destructures first by copying it from obj  extracting it from the object structure .   166  ❘  CHAPTER 7    Destructuring  Destructuring syntax, added in ES2015 and extended in ES2018, gives you a new way to do that,  which can be more concise  though isn’t necessarily  and quite powerful, providing default values,  renaming, nesting, and rest syntax. It also provides clarity and expressiveness, particularly when  applied to function parameters.  BASIC OBJECT DESTRUCTURING  The new syntax gives you a new way to destructure things, usually with less repetition and fewer  unnecessary variables.  It might seem more verbose initially, but bear with me.  Instead of writing:  let obj = {first: 1, second: 2}; let a = obj.first;             Old, manual destructuring console.log a ;                1  you can write:  let obj = {first: 1, second: 2}; let {first: a} = obj;          New destructuring syntax console.log a ;                1  That destructuring tells the JavaScript engine to put the value of the first property into the variable a.   Again, for the moment, that’s both longer and more awkward than the manual form, but you’ll see how  it gets more concise and expressive in a moment.  Notice how the destructuring pattern {first: a} looks exactly like an object literal. That’s inten- tional: the syntax for them is exactly the same, even though they serve converse purposes. An object  literal puts a structure together, while an object destructuring pattern takes it apart—in exactly the  same way. In the object literal {first: a}, first is the name of the property to create, and a is  the source of the property’s value. In the object destructuring pattern {first: a}, it’s the converse:  first is the name of the property to read, and a is the target to put the value into. The JavaScript  engine knows whether you’re writing an object literal or object destructuring pattern from context:  an object literal can’t be on the left-hand side of an assignment  for instance , and a destructuring pat- tern can’t be used where a value is expected, such as on the right-hand side of an assignment.  The fact that object literals and object destructuring patterns are effectively mirror images of each  other is even clearer if you do something like this:  let {first: a} = {first: 42}; console.log a ;    42  See Figure 7-1 for a visualization of that first line. First the  object literal is evaluated, creating a new object and putting the  value 42 into its first property, then when doing the assign- ment to the right-hand side, the destructuring pattern takes the  value of the first property and puts it in the variable a.  Destructuring  pattern  Object literal  let {first: a} = {first: 42};  FIGURE 7-1    Basic Object Destructuring ❘ 167  t    The  target  in the preceding example is a variable being declared with  target of a destructuring pattern can be anything you can assign to: a variable, an object property, an array entry, etc. —if it can be on the left-hand side of an assignment, you can assign to it with destruc- turing.  That also means you can make the target another destructuring pattern. You ’ ll learn about that later in the “Nested Destructuring” section.   let , the variable a . But the    Let ’ s continue with the initial example in this section. Just like manual destructuring, if the object  doesn ’ t have the property you’re trying to read, the variable will get the value  undefined :      let obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   let {third: c} = obj;   console.log c ;            undefined, obj doesn't have a property called 'third'        That destructuring is exactly the same as let c = obj.third; , so it does the same thing.   It ’ s very common to want to use the name of the property as the name of the variable as well, so rather than repeating it like this:      let obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   let {first: first} = obj;    console.log first ;            1    you can just leave the colon and name after it off:      let obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   let {first} = obj;    console.log first ;            1      Now it ’ s more concise than the equivalent, since the old equivalent repeats the name:      let first = obj.first;      If {first}  looks familiar, it ’ s because it ’ s the converse of the shorthand properties you learned about in Chapter   5  : if that were an object literal, it would create a property called first  and get the initial  value for the property from an in-scope identifier called first . Again, object destructuring syntax is  exactly the same as object literal syntax; it ’ s just what the JavaScript engine does with it that ’ s differ- ent between the two.    Since using the same name like that is so common, for now I ’ m going to do that in the examples; later in this chapter I ’ ll come back to using a different name for the variable and the reasons you might want to do that.   NOTE    I use  let  in various examples, but destructuring is not a feature of let  or  const , or  var  . How  and where  you declare the variables doesn ’ t matter;  destructuring isn ’ t linked to variable declaration. More on that in a moment.  r   Destructuring starts to be really powerful when you ’ re picking out more than one property:      const obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   let {first, second} = obj;     console.log first, second ;    1 2   168 ❘ CHAPTER 7    DESTRUCTURING      That ’ s equivalent to:      const obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   let first = obj.first, second = obj.second;     console.log first, second ;    1 2      This is where the expressiveness comes in. By putting the  {first, second}  on the left-hand side  and just having the object on the right, it ’ s quite clear  once you ’ re used to it!  what you ’ re tak- ing from the object. In contrast, in the longer form second  is buried in the middle of the statement  and easily overlooked. It also saves a fair bit of typing reading in that example: instead of having to write  first ,  second , and  obj  twice  or read them twice if reading code , you only have to type read them once.    It ’ s not just about being concise and expressive, though, it also helps you avoid unnecessary tem- porary variables. Suppose you need to call a function that returns an object, and you just want two  properties from that object. Instead of:      const obj = getSomeObject  ;     let first = obj.first;   let second = obj.second;    you can do this:      let {first, second} = getSomeObject  ;        No need for the obj  variable at all!   Destructuring isn ’ t limited to variable constant initializers; you can use it in any assignment  and in  parameter lists, as you ’ ll see in a later section . There ’ s one small “gotcha”: if you ’ re doing the assign- ment where the JavaScript parser is expecting a statement  not an expression , you need to wrap the assignment expression in parentheses since otherwise the parser treats the initial curly brace  {   as the beginning of a block.      let first, second;        ...   {first, second} = getSomeObject  ;      SyntaxError: Unexpected token =    {first, second} = getSomeObject   ;    Works      Using the parentheses tells the parser it ’ s dealing with an expression, and so the leading  {  can ’ t be the  beginning of a block.    Destructuring is just syntactic sugar for picking out the properties with the old-style equivalent code.  Knowing that, what do you think would happen with the following code?      let {first, second} = undefined;        It helps to consider what the de-sugared version would look like:      const temp = undefined;   let first = temp.first, second = temp.second;      If you ’ re thinking it ’ s an error, you ’ re spot on: that ’ s exactly right. As always, it ’ s a TypeError  to try to read a property from undefined   or null  .   Similarly, what ’ s the result here?      let {first, second} = 42;     Basic Array  and Iterable  Destructuring ❘ 169      No, not an error, bit of a trick question there. Remember the de-sugared version:      const temp = 42;     let first = temp.first, second = temp.second;      Just like any other time you treat a number like an object, the primitive number is coerced to a  Number object and, in that example, the properties first  and  second  are read from that object.  They don ’ t exist, of course  unless someone ’ s been modifying Number.prototype ! , so  first  and second  get the value  undefined .  Try it with  toString  instead of first , though, and log the type of  what you get.      BASIC ARRAY  AND ITERABLE  DESTRUCTURING   You can destructure arrays and other iterables, too. Unsurprisingly, the syntax uses square brackets  []   instead of the curly braces   {}   used by object destructuring:      const arr = [1, 2];   const [first, second] = arr;     console.log first, second ;    1 2      In fact, just as object destructuring uses the exact same syntax as an object literal, array destructur- ing uses the exact same syntax as an array literal. The value each target receives depends on where  it is in the pattern. So with [first, second] , first  gets the value from arr[0]  because it ’ s in the 0th position, and  second  gets the value from  arr[1]  because it ’ s in the 1st position. It ’ s just like  you ’ d written:      const arr = [1, 2];   const first = arr[0], second = arr[1];     console.log first, second ;    1 2      It ’ s valid to leave out elements you don ’ t want. Notice that the following code has no variable in the  0th position:      const arr = [1, 2];   const [, second] = arr;   console.log second ;    2        You can leave gaps in the middle, too:      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];     const [, b, , , e] = arr;     console.log b, e ;    2 5        Of course, just like with the array literals they mirror, readability suffers if you ’ re leaving out more than a couple of elements.  See “Using Different Names” later in this chapter for an alternative.    Unlike object destructuring, you don ’ t need to wrap the expression in parentheses when you ’ re doing assignment rather than initialization where a statement is expected; the initial square bracket  [   isn ’ t  ambiguous the way the initial curly brace  {   is, at least not in the normal case:      const arr = [1, 2];   let first, second;     [first, second] = arr;   console.log first, second ;    1 2   170 ❘ CHAPTER 7    DESTRUCTURING      However, if you ’ re in the habit of relying on automatic semicolon insertion  ASI  rather than writing explicit semicolons, as always beware of starting a statement with a square bracket, since ASI will often assume it ’ s part of the expression at the end of the previous line if there ’ s no semicolon to tell it  otherwise. The code in the previous example would be fine without semicolons, but it wouldn ’ t be if  you had  for instance  a function call prior to the destructuring:      const arr = [1, 2]     let first, second     console.log "ASI hazard"      [first, second] = arr     TypeError: Cannot set property 'undefined' of undefined   console.log first, second         That fails because the parser treats the [first, second]  as a property accessor  with a comma expression inside  that ’ s setting a property on whatever  console.log  returns, as though  you ’ d written      console.log "ASI hazard" [first, second] = arr      Through a series of steps that ends up trying to set the value of a property on the result of  console.log . Since  console.log  returns  undefined , that fails; you can ’ t set properties on undefined .  ASI hazards like this don ’ t always result in error messages, sometimes you just get odd bugs. But this one would.    If you rely on ASI, you probably already know about that hazard and are in the habit of putting a semicolon at the beginning of a line that would otherwise start with an opening square bracket,  which solves the problem:      const arr = [1, 2]     let first, second     console.log "ASI hazard"    ;  [first, second] = arr   console.log first, second     1, 2      Using destructuring just means you may have more lines that start with square brackets.    DEFAULTS    As you learned in the last section, if the object doesn ’ t have the property you ’ ve specified in your  destructuring pattern, the target will get the value undefined   just like when when you destructure  manually :      With destructuring, you can specify a default that will  only  be applied if the property is missing or  has the value  undefined :      const obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   const {third} = obj;     console.log third ;    undefined        const obj = {first: 1, second: 2};   const {third = 3} = obj;   console.log third ;    3   Defaults  ❘  171  This is exactly like the default function parameters you saw in Chapter 3: the default is only evalu- ated, and only used, if the result of retrieving the property is the value undefined  either because the  object didn’t have the property, or the property had the value undefined . And like function param- eter defaults, while it’s similar to the third = obj.third  3 trick, it’s less problematic, because  the default only kicks in if the effective value is undefined, not if it’s any other falsy value:1  const obj = {first: 1, second: 2, third: 0}; const {third = 3} = obj; console.log third ;    0, not 3  “FALSY” AND “TRUTHY”  A falsy value is any value that coerces to false when used as a boolean, such as in  an if condition. The falsy values are 0, "", NaN, null, undefined, and of course,  false.  The DOM’s document.all is also falsy, you’ll learn about that in  Chapter 17.  All other values are truthy.  Let’s look closer at default destructuring values; run the code in Listing 7-1.  LISTING 7-1:  Default destructuring values—default-destructuring-value.js  function getDefault val  {     console.log "defaulted to " + val ;     return val; } const obj = {first: 1, second: 2, third: 3, fourth: undefined}; const {     third = getDefault "three" ,     fourth = getDefault "four" ,     fifth = getDefault "five"  } = obj;    "defaulted to four"    "defaulted to five" console.log third ;            3 console.log fourth ;       "four" console.log fifth ;            "five"  Notice that getDefault isn’t called for third, because obj has a property called third with a non- undefined value. But it’s called for fourth, because although obj has a property called fourth, its  value is undefined. And getDefault is called for fifth, because obj doesn’t have a fifth property  at all, so its effective value is undefined. Also notice that the calls to getDefault were in order, first  the one for fourth and then the one for fifth. Destructuring is done in source code order.  1  The nullish coalescing operator you’ll learn about in Chapter 17 gets you even closer: the statement const third =  obj.third ?? 3; will only use the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand’s value is undefined or null. See  Chapter 17 for details. So that’s similar, but both parameter and destructuring defaults only kick in for undefined.   172  ❘  CHAPTER 7    Destructuring  Because destructuring is done in source code order, later targets can refer to the value of earlier tar- gets in their defaults  like defaults in parameter lists . So, for instance, if you’re destructuring a, b, and  c from an object and want the default for c to be a * 3, you can do that declaratively:  const obj = {a: 10, b: 20}; const {a, b, c = a * 3} = obj; console.log c ;     30  You can only refer to targets defined earlier in the pattern; this doesn’t work, for instance:  const obj = {a: 10, b: 20}; const {c = a * 3, b, a} = obj;    ReferenceError: a is not defined console.log c ;  That makes sense if you consider the de-sugared version; a hasn’t been declared yet:  const obj = {a: 10, b: 20}; const c = typeof obj.a === "undefined"           ? a * 3          ReferenceError: a is not defined           : obj.c; const b = obj.b; const a = obj.a; console.log c ;  If the variables were already declared, you could use them though. What do you think the result of  running this code is?  let a, b, c; const obj = {a: 10, b: 20};  {c = a * 3, b, a} = obj ; console.log c ;  Did you say it outputs NaN? Right! Because when c’s default is calculated, a has the value   undefined, and undefined * 3 is NaN.  REST SYNTAX IN DESTRUCTURING PATTERNS  You saw rest syntax in Chapter 3 when learning about using a rest parameter in a function’s param- eter list. You can also use rest syntax when destructuring, and it works the same way:  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const [first, second, ...rest] = a; console.log first ;        1 console.log second ;       2 console.log rest ;         [3, 4, 5]  In that code, first gets the value of the first array entry, second gets the value of the second entry,  and rest gets a new array containing the rest of the values. The rest entry in the pattern must be at  the end  just like the rest parameter needed to be at the end of the function parameter list .  Rest syntax for array destructuring was in ES2015; ES2018 added rest syntax for object destructuring  as well, which is the converse of object property spread  Chapter 5 :  const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5}; const {a, d, ...rest} = obj; console.log a ;        1   Using Different Names  ❘  173  console.log d ;        4 console.log rest ;     {b: 2, c: 3, e: 5}  The rest entry gets a new object with the properties from the original object that weren’t consumed  by other entries in the destructuring pattern. In that example, the object got the b, c, and e properties  but not a and d because a and d were consumed by an earlier part of the pattern. Just like the rest  entry of iterable destructuring, it has to be the last thing in the pattern.  USING DIFFERENT NAMES  Other than early in this chapter, all of the object destructuring you’ve seen so far has used the name  of the source property as the name of the target variable constant. Let’s look again at a slightly  updated example from earlier:  const obj = {first: 1, second: 2}; let {first} = obj; console.log first ;         1  Suppose you had a good reason for not using that property name as the variable name? For instance,  suppose the property name isn’t a valid identifier:  const obj = {"my-name": 1}; let {my-name} = obj;        SyntaxError: Unexpected token - let {"my-name"} = obj;      SyntaxError: Unexpected token }  Property names can contain just about anything, but an identifier name has fairly strict rules  no  dashes, for instance  and unlike property names, there’s no quoted format for identifiers.  If you were doing it manually, you’d just use a different name:  You can do that with destructuring, too, by including an explicit variable name instead of using short- hand syntax:  const obj = {"my-name": 1}; const myName = obj["my-name"]; console.log myName ;         1  const obj = {"my-name": 1}; const {"my-name": myName} = obj; console.log myName ;         1  const obj = {first: 1}; const {first: myName} = obj; console.log myName ;         1  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const [, b, , , e] = arr; console.log b, e ;    2, 5  That’s the equivalent of the manual version earlier. Remember that the syntax is identical to object  initializer syntax. That includes the fact that the property name can be quoted.  If the property name is a valid identifier name but you just don’t want to use that name for some  reason, you don’t need the quotes:  This is also handy when you’re picking out a set of specific indexes from an array. Recall the earlier  example leaving gaps in the pattern:   174 ❘ CHAPTER 7    DESTRUCTURING      That works, but keeping track of the number of gaps there  particularly before  e   makes reading it difficult. Since arrays are objects, you can perhaps make that clearer by using object destructuring rather than array destructuring:      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];     const {1: b, 4: e} = arr;     console.log b, e ;    2 5        Since numeric constants are valid property names, but not valid identifiers  you can ’ t have variables  called  1  and  4  , you don ’ t need quotes, but you do need to rename them  to  b  and  e  in this case .    This index trick works because array indexes are property names, so this trick doesn ’ t work on itera- bles in general, just arrays.  If the iterable is finite, you can use Array.from  to get an array for it and  then apply this trick, though that may be overkill.    When specifying the target explicitly, the target of destructuring can be anything you can assign to. It  could be an object property, for instance:      const source = {example: 42};     const dest = {};      {example: dest.result} = source ;   console.log dest.result ;    42          COMPUTED PROPERTY NAMES   In Chapter   5   you learned about computed property names in object literals. Since object destructur- ing uses the exact same syntax as object literals, you can use computed property names when destruc- turing, too:      let source = {a: "ayy", b: "bee"};   let name = Math.random   < 0.5 ? "a" : "b";     let {[name]: dest} = source;     console.log dest ;    "ayy" half the time, "bee" the other half        In that code, half the time the  name  variable gets the value  "a"  and half the time it gets the value  "b" ,  so the  dest  variable gets its value from the  a  property half the time and gets its value from the b property the other half.      NESTED DESTRUCTURING   So far you ’ ve seen taking array entry and object property values from just the top level of the array  object, but destructuring syntax can go deeper by using nesting  in the pattern. You ’ ll never guess, but you do it the same way you create nested objects arrays in object and array literals! Who would have  thought. Let ’ s look at that.  g   Recall that in the following,  array  is the target for the value of the a  property:      const obj = {a: [1, 2, 3], b: [4, 5, 6]};     let {a: array} = obj;   console.log array ;    [1, 2, 3]   Parameter Destructuring ❘ 175      In that case, the target  the part to the right of the :   is the variable or constant, etc., that the destruc- tured value should go into. That ’ s been true in all of the examples you ’ ve seen so far. But if you  just want the first two entries in that array, as discrete variables, you can make the target an array  destructuring pattern instead, with target variables inside it:      const obj = {a: [1, 2, 3], b: [4, 5, 6]};     let {a: [first, second]} = obj;     console.log first, second ;    1 2      Notice again how this exactly mirrors creating an object with a property initialized with a new array  built using the values from first  and  second . We ’ re just using it on the other side of the equals sign, because we ’ re taking the structure apart rather than putting it together.   Naturally it works just as well for objects:      const arr = {first: {a: 1, b: 2}, second: {a: 3, b: 4}};     const {first: {a}, second: {b}} = arr;     console.log a, b ;    1 4        That code picked out the a  property from the object referenced by the  first  property, and the  b property from the object referenced by the second  property.    The outer structure could be an array instead of an object as well:      const arr = [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 3, b: 4}];     const [{a}, {b}] = arr;   console.log a, b ;    1 4        That code picked out the a  property from the object in the first array entry, and the  b  property from the object in the second array entry.    As with object and array literals, the amount of nesting you can use is essentially unlimited.      PARAMETER DESTRUCTURING   Destructuring isn ’ t just for assignments. You can destructure function parameters, too:      function example {a, b}  {         console.log a, b ;   }     const o = {a: "ayy", b: "bee", c: "see", d: "dee"};     example o ;                 "ayy" "bee"     example {a: 1, b: 2} ;      1 2      Note the object destructuring  {a, b}   used in the parameter list. That  example  accepts a single  parameter and destructures it into two local bindings, almost as though you ’ d written:      function example obj  {       let {a, b} = obj;       console.log a, b ;   }         It ’ s “almost” because of the temporary parameter obj  and because, if the parameter list includes  any default parameter values, it occurs in a scope specific to the parameter list rather than within the   176  ❘  CHAPTER 7    DESTRUCTURING  function body. Also, parameters are more like variables declared with var  than variables declared  with let , for historic reasons.     The parameter being destructured doesn ’ t have to be the first one, or the only one; it can be anywhere in the parameter list:      function example first, {a, b}, last  {         console.log first, a, b, last ;   }     const o = {a: "ayy", b: "bee", c: "see", d: "dee"};     example "alpha", o, "omega" ;                  "alpha" "ayy" "bee" "omega"     example "primero", {a: 1, b: 2}, "ultimo" ;    "primero" 1 2 "ultimo"      Conceptually, you can imagine it as one big nested array destructuring pattern, where the parameter  list is enclosed in square brackets to form an array destructuring pattern, and then the equals sign and an array of the arguments go on the right. See Figure   7-2  .  Implied  function example  [first, {a, b}, last] = [the arguments]   {   }  console.log first, a, b, last ;   FIGURE 7-2            So this function and call:      function example first, {a, b}, last  {         console.log first, a, b, last ;   }     example 1, {a: 2, b: 3}, 4 ;    1 2 3 4      work exactly the way this assignment does with those arguments as an array:      let [first, {a, b}, last] = [1, {a: 2, b: 3}, 4];   console.log first, a, b, last ;    1 2 3 4        Naturally you can use iterable destructuring as well:      function example [a, b]  {         console.log a, b ;   }     const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];     example arr ;                     1, 2     example ["ayy", "bee"] ;          "ayy", "bee"      And similarly, destructuring default values:      function example {a, b = 2}  {         console.log a, b ;   }     const o = {a: 1};     example o ;                 1 2      There,  b  was defaulted because  o  didn ’ t have it. It would also have been defaulted if  o  had had it, but  its value had been undefined .   Parameter Destructuring ❘ 177   In that example, although b  didn ’ t exist on the object that was passed in, an object was passed in. But what about the case where no object is passed in at all? Given that same example  function, what do  you think happens with the following call?      example  ;      If you said it would be an error, spot on. It ’ s just like doing this:      let {a, b = 2} = undefined;      or, if you consider the entire parameter list, doing this:      let [{a, b = 2}] = [];      You can ’ t read properties from undefined ; trying to is a  TypeError .    Thinking back to what you learned in Chapter   3  , is there something you could use to handle the case  where no object is passed in at all?   Yes! A default parameter value. Hang onto your hats:      function example {a, b = "prop b def"} = {a: "param def a", b: "param def b"}  {         console.log a, b ;   }     example  ;                       "param def a" "param def b"   example {a: "ayy"} ;             "ayy "  "prop b def"        That could be a bit confusing, so let ’ s diagram it  see Figure   7-3   :  ➤ {a, b = "prop b def"}  is the parameter destructuring pattern.   ➤  The  = "prop b def"  part of the pattern is the default for the destructured  b  property  if it ’ s  not in the object passed in, or has the value undefined  . d  ➤ = {a: "param def a", b: "param def b"}  is the default parameter value  if no argument  is passed for this parameter, or the argument ’ s value is  undefined  .d  Parameter destructuring   Default for destructured b property   function example {a, b = "prop b def"} = {a: "param def a", b: "param def b"}  {     console.log a, b ; } example  ; example {a: "ayy"} ;   Default parameter value   FIGURE 7-3               example  ;   Using that knowledge, let ’ s look at the two calls. The first call:    didn ’ t pass anything in for the parameter, so the default parameter value {a: "param def a", b: "param def b"}  was used. That has a value for b , so the destructured  b  got the value "param def b" .   178  ❘  CHAPTER 7    Destructuring  The second call:  example {a: "ayy"} ;  passed in an object with no b, so the default parameter value didn’t apply  we have an argument   for the parameter, and its value isn’t undefined , but the destructuring default value for b did apply  since the object doesn’t have a b property. So b got the value "b def".  As you were working through that example, a thought may have occurred to you about default func- tion parameters. If it didn’t, stop for a moment and think about the various things you’ve learned  in this section.  Hint: it has to do with parameter lists being implicit destructuring patterns, think of  Figure 7-3 . . .   Got it? This one’s a bit tricky, if you aren’t seeing it yet, don’t worry! It’s this: default function param- eters are effectively just default destructuring values. That example function parameter list is equiva- lent to this destructuring when you call example with no parameters:  let [{a, b = "b def"} = {a: "param def a", b: "param def b"}] = []; console.log a, b ;    "param def a", "param def b"  One final note about destructuring in parameter lists: using destructuring in a parameter list makes  it non-simple. As you learned in Chapter 3, a function with a non-simple parameter list can’t contain  a "use strict" directive; if you want it to be in strict mode, it has to appear in a context that’s  already in strict mode.  DESTRUCTURING IN LOOPS  In JavaScript, there are some assignments that don’t look a lot like assignments. In particular, the  for-in and for-of2 loops assign to the loop variable at the beginning of each loop iteration. You can  use destructuring in them, too. It’s not a lot of use in a for-in loop  the keys a for-in provides are  always strings, and it’s rare you want to destructure a string—although you can, since strings are iter- able , but it can be very handy when using for-of.  Suppose you have an array of objects and want to loop through it using the name and value property  of the objects:  const arr = [     {name: "one", value: 1},     {name: "two", value: 2},     {name: "forty-two", value: 42} ]; for  const {name, value} of arr  {     console.log "Name: " + name + ", value: " + value ; }  Or suppose you have an object and you want to loop over its “own”  not inherited  property names  and values. You might use a for-in loop:  const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}; for  const name in obj  {  2 And for-await-of, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 9.   Old Habits to New  ❘  179      if  obj.hasOwnProperty name   {         const value = obj[name];         console.log name + " = " + value ;     } }  Or you could get rid of that hasOwnPropertyCheck by using a for-of loop and the   Object.entries function you learned about in Chapter 5:  const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}; for  const entry of Object.entries obj   {     console.log entry[0] + " = " + entry[1] ; }  but entry[0] and entry[1] aren’t very meaningful names. With destructuring, you can make that  code much clearer with iterable destructuring:  const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}; for  const [name, value] of Object.entries obj   {     console.log name + " = " + value ; }  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Effectively, this section could be just “use destructuring wherever it makes sense.” But here are some  specific examples where it may make sense.  Use Destructuring When Getting Only Some Properties  from an Object  Old habit: Getting an object from a function and remembering it in a variable, only to then use only  a small number of its properties:  const person = getThePerson  ; console.log "The person is " + person.firstName + " " + person.lastName ;  New habit: Use destructuring instead in situations where you don’t need the object itself for any- thing later:  const {firstName, lastName} = getThePerson  ; console.log "The person is " + firstName + " " + lastName ;  Use Destructuring for Options Objects  Old habit: Using options objects for functions with lots of options.  New habit: Consider using destructuring.  Before destructuring, a function accepting five options, where the five option’s default is based on  the one option’s value, might look like this:  function doSomethingNifty options  {     options = Object.assign {}, options, {            The default options   180  ❘  CHAPTER 7    Destructuring          one: 1,         two: 2,         three: 3,         four: 4       } ;     if  options.five === undefined  {         options.five = options.one * 5;     }     console.log "The 'five' option is: " + options.five ;        ... } doSomethingNifty  ;    The 'five' option is: 5  That hides the defaults inside the function’s code, meaning that any complicated default value has to  be special-cased, and meaning you have to do a property access on your options object each time you  use an option.  Instead, you can define your default options as destructuring defaults, handle the defaulting of five  within the destructuring default, provide an overall blank object for the parameter default value, and  the use the resulting bindings directly:  function doSomethingNifty {         one = 1,         two = 2,         three = 3,         four = 4,         five = one * 5 } = {}  {     console.log "The 'five' option is: " + five ;        ... } doSomethingNifty  ;    The 'five' option is: 5   Promises  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ Creating and using promises  ➤➤ “Promises” and “thenables”  ➤➤ Promise patterns  ➤➤ Promise anti-patterns  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode  or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter you’ll learn about ES2015’s promises, which simplify and standardize the  handling of one-off asynchronous operations, reducing “callback hell”  and paving the way for  ES2018’s async functions, covered in Chapter 9 . A promise is an object representing an asyn- chronous result  like an HTTP request completing or a one-off timer firing . You use a promise  to observe the result of an asynchronous process, and or give the promise to other code so  that other code can observe that result. Promises are JavaScript’s version of a pattern variously  called promises, futures, or deferreds. They draw heavily on prior art, in particular the Prom- ises A+ specification1 and the work leading up to it.  Before we get started: You may have heard that promises are obsolete, because ES2018 added  async functions  Chapter 9 . That’s mostly incorrect. It’s true that you’ll interact with promises  differently when using async functions, but you’ll still be interacting with them, and you’ll still  need to have a solid idea how they work. Also, there are times you’ll use promises directly, even  in an async function.  1 https:  promisesaplus.com    182  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  WHY PROMISES?  A promise doesn’t do anything of its own, it’s just a way to observe the result of something asyn- chronous. Promises don’t make operations asynchronous. They just provide a means of observing the  completion of operations that are already asynchronous. So what good are they?  Before promises, simple callbacks were commonly used for this, but they have some issues:  ➤➤ Combining multiple async operations  in series or in parallel  quickly leads to deeply nested   callbacks  “callback hell” .  ➤➤ Callbacks have no standard way of indicating an error occurred; instead, each function or  API you use has to define how it reports an error. There are several common ways, which  are different from one another, making it difficult when combining multiple libraries or  modules, or moving from project to project.  ➤➤ Not having a standard way of indicating success failure means you can’t use common tools   to manage complexity.  ➤➤ Adding a callback to a process that has already completed is also not standardized. In some   cases, it means the callback is never called; in others, it gets called synchronously; and in  others, it will get called asynchronously. Checking the details for each API you use each  time you need to handle this is time-consuming and easy to forget. The bugs you get when  you assume or misremember are often subtle and hard to find.  ➤➤ Adding multiple callbacks to an operation is either impossible or not standardized.  Promises deal with all of that by providing simple, standard semantics addressing all of those issues.  You’ll see how as you learn those semantics throughout this chapter. Along the way, you’ll see exam- ples of using promises vs. bare callbacks that illustrate the preceding issues.  PROMISE FUNDAMENTALS  In this section, first you’ll learn the very basics of promises; then in subsequent sections you’ll  learn more detail of the various aspects of creating and using them. There’s a fair bit of terminol- ogy up front.  Overview  A promise is an object with three possible states:  ➤➤ Pending: The promise is pending outstanding not yet settled. ➤➤ Fulfilled: The promise has been settled with a value. This usually means success. ➤➤ Rejected: The promise has been settled with a rejection reason. This usually means failure.   Promise Fundamentals  ❘  183  A promise starts out pending and then can only be settled  fulfilled or rejected  once. A settled prom- ise can’t go back to being pending. A fulfilled promise can’t change to a rejected one or vice versa.  Once settled, the promise’s state never changes.  A fulfilled promise has a fulfillment value  usually simply value ; a rejected promise has a rejection  reason  sometimes simply reason, though error is common as well .  When you resolve a promise, you’re either fulfilling it with a value or you’re making it dependent  on another promise.2 When you make it dependent on another promise, you “resolve it to” the other  promise. That means ultimately it might be fulfilled or rejected, depending on what happens to the  other promise.  When you reject a promise, you’re making it rejected with a rejection reason.  ERRORS AS REJECTION REASONS  In the code in this chapter, you’ll notice that all of the examples of rejection reasons  are Error instances. I do that because rejecting a promise is like using throw. In both  cases, having the stack information Error provides is useful. Doing that is a matter  of style and best practices, though; you can use any value you want as a rejection  reason, just like you can use any value you want with throw and try catch.  You can’t directly observe a promise’s state and value rejection reason  if any ; you can only get them  by adding handler functions that the promise calls. A JavaScript promise has three methods for regis- tering handlers:  ➤➤ then: Adds a fulfillment handler to call if when the promise gets fulfilled3 ➤➤ catch: Adds a rejection handler to call if when the promise gets rejected ➤➤ finally: Adds a finally handler to call if when the promise gets settled, regardless of how    added in ES2018   One of the key aspects of promises is that then, catch, and finally return a new promise. The new  promise is connected to the promise you called the method on: it will get fulfilled or rejected depend- ing on what happens to that original promise and what your handler function s  do. We’ll come back  to this key point throughout this chapter.  2 Or a “thenable.” You’ll learn about thenables a little further along in this chapter. 3  That’s what the single-argument version does. You can also call it with two arguments, which you’ll learn about in  “The then Method with Two Arguments” later in this chapter.   184  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  Example  Listing 8-1 has a simple example of creating and using a promise, using setTimeout for the asyn- chronous operation being observed. Run the example repeatedly. Half the time, the promise it creates  gets fulfilled; the other half, it gets rejected.  LISTING 8-1:  Simple promise example—simple-promise-example.js  function example   {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         setTimeout    => {             try {                 const succeed = Math.random   < 0.5;                 if  succeed  {                     console.log "resolving with 42  will fulfill the promise " ;                     resolve 42 ;                 } else {                     console.log "rejecting with new Error 'failed' " ;                     throw new Error "failed" ;                 }             } catch  e  {                 reject e ;             }         }, 100 ;     } ; }   example   .then value => {     fulfillment handler     console.log "fulfilled with", value ; }  .catch error => {    rejection handler     console.error "rejected with", error ; }  .finally    => {     finally handler     console.log "finally" ; } ;  There are three parts to that:  1.  Creating the promise: done by the example function, which creates and returns it 2.  Resolving or rejecting the promise: done by the example function’s timer callback 3.  Using the promise: done by the code calling example  example uses the Promise constructor to create the promise, passing in a function. The function  you give the Promise constructor has a fancy name: executor function. The Promise constructor  calls the executor function  synchronously  passing two functions to it as arguments: resolve and  reject.  Those are the conventional names. But of course, you can use whatever names you want for  the parameters in your executor function. Sometimes you see fulfill instead of resolve, although    Promise Fundamentals  ❘  185  that’s not quite correct as you’ll see in a moment.  You use the resolve and reject functions to  determine what happens to the promise:  ➤➤ If you call resolve with another promise,4 the promise gets resolved to that other promise   it will get fulfilled or rejected depending on what happens to that other promise . This is  why fulfill isn’t an accurate name for the first function; when you call it with another  promise, it doesn’t fulfill the promise you created, it just resolves it to that other promise,  which might reject.  ➤➤ If you call resolve with any other value, the promise gets fulfilled with that value. ➤➤ If you call reject, the promise gets rejected using the reason you pass into reject  usually  an Error, but that’s a matter of style . Unlike resolve, reject doesn’t do something differ- ent if you give it a promise. It always uses what you give it as the rejection reason.  The promise can only be resolved or rejected using those functions. Nothing can resolve or reject  it without them. They aren’t available as methods on the promise object itself, so you can give the  promise object to other code knowing that the code receiving it can only consume the promise, not  resolve or reject it.  In example’s case, it calls setTimeout to start an asynchronous operation. It has to use setTimeout   or similar because, again, promises are just a way of observing the completion of asynchronous  operations, not creating asynchronous operations.5 When the timer expires, example’s timer callback  either calls resolve or reject depending on the random result.  Turning to how the promise is used: The code using example uses a chain of calls, in this case then  followed by catch followed by finally, to hook up a fulfillment handler, a rejection handler, and a  finally handler, respectively. Chaining is quite common with promise methods, for reasons you’ll  learn as you progress through the chapter.  Run the code in Listing 8-1 enough times to see both a fulfillment and a rejection. When the prom- ise gets fulfilled, the chain calls the fulfillment handler with the fulfillment value, then the finally  handler  which doesn’t receive any value . When the promise gets rejected, the chain calls the rejection  handler with the rejection reason, then the finally handler  which, again, doesn’t receive any value .  It would also call the rejection handler  and then the finally handler  if the original promise was  fulfilled but the fulfillment handler threw an error; more on that in a bit.  The fulfillment, rejection, and finally handlers serve the same purpose as the blocks in a try   catch finally statement:  try {        do something        fulfillment handler } catch  error  {        rejection handler } finally {        finally handler }  There are slight differences you’ll learn later, particularly around finally, but that’s fundamentally a  good way to think about fulfillment, rejection, and finally handlers.  4 Or, again, any “thenable.” You’ll learn about thenables in the next section. 5 There’s a small caveat here that we’ll come to later.   186  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  Using new Promise is fairly rare compared with using a promise from an API function or the ones  you get from then, catch, and finally, so we’ll focus initially on using promises, then come back to  the details of creating them.  Promises and “Thenables”  JavaScript’s promises follow rules defined by the ECMAScript specification, which draw heavily  on prior art, in particular the Promises A+ specification and the work leading up to it. JavaScript’s  promises are fully compliant with the Promises A+ specification, and have some additional features  intentionally not covered by that specification, such as catch and finally.  The Promises A+ specifi- cation is intentionally minimalist and defines only then, because what catch and finally do can be  done with the two-argument version of then that you’ll learn about in a later section.   One aspect of the Promises A+ specification is the concept of “thenables” as distinct from “promises.”  Here’s how that specification defines them:  ➤➤ A “promise” is an object or function with a then method whose behavior conforms to [the   Promises A+ specification].  ➤➤ A “thenable” is an object or function that defines a then method.  So all promises are thenables, but not all thenables are promises. An object might define a method  called then that doesn’t work as defined for promises; that object would be a thenable, but not  a promise.   Why is this important? Interoperability.  Sometimes, a promise implementation needs to know whether a value is a simple value it can use  to fulfill the promise, or a thenable it should resolve the promise to. It does that by checking if the  value is an object with a then method: if so, the object is assumed to be a thenable and the promise  implementation uses its then method to resolve the promise to the thenable. This is imperfect, since  an object can have a then method that means something completely unrelated to promises, but it was  the best solution at the time promises were being added to JavaScript because it allowed the multiple  promise libraries that existed at the time  and still exist  to interoperate without every implementa- tion having to be updated to add some other feature to mark its promises as being promises.  It  would have been a great use case for a Symbol [Chapter 5], for instance, if it had been possible to  update every library to add it.   Up to this point, I’ve used “promise” with a footnote in a couple of places where “thenable” would be  more accurate. Now that you know what a thenable is, I’ll start using it where appropriate.  USING AN EXISTING PROMISE  As you’ve seen, you hook into the fulfillment, rejection, or completion of a promise using handlers  registered with then, catch, and finally. In this section, you’ll learn about that in more detail, learn  some of the general patterns for using promises, and also learn how promises solve some of the issues  mentioned earlier in “Why Promises?”   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  187  The then Method  You’ve already briefly seen the then method in action, hooking into a promise’s fulfillment.6 Let’s  look at then in a bit more detail. Consider this very basic call to then:  p2 = p1.then result => doSomethingWith result.toUpperCase    ;  As you’ve already learned, it registers a fulfillment handler, creating and returning a new promise  p2   that will get fulfilled or rejected depending on what happens to the original promise  p1  and what  you do in your handler. If p1 gets rejected, the handler isn’t called and p2 is rejected with p1’s   rejection reason. If p1 gets fulfilled, the handler gets called. Here’s what happens to p2 depending on  what your handler does:  ➤➤ If you return a thenable, p2 gets resolved to that thenable  it will get fulfilled or rejected   depending on what happens to that thenable .  ➤➤ If you return any other value, p2 gets fulfilled with that value. ➤➤ If you use throw  or call a function that throws , p2 gets rejected using what you threw    usually an Error  as the rejection reason.  Those three bullet points probably seem familiar. That’s because they’re nearly identical to the bullet  points you saw earlier saying what you can do with the resolve and reject functions you get in a  promise executor function. Returning something from your then handler is just like calling resolve.  Using throw in your handler is just like calling reject.  This ability to return a thenable is one of the keys of promises, so let’s look at it more closely.  Chaining Promises  The fact that you can return a promise  or any thenable  from a then catch finally handler to  resolve the promise they create means that if you need to do a series of asynchronous operations that  provide promises thenables, you can use then on the first operation and have the handler return the  thenable for the second operation, repeated as many times as you need. Here’s a chain with three  operations returning promises:  firstOperation   .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult      or: .then secondOperation  .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2   .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` *  }  .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  When that code runs, firstOperation starts the first operation and returns a promise. Calls to then  and catch set up handlers for what happens next  see Figure 8-1, overleaf . Later, when the first oper- ation completes, what happens next depends on what happened to the first operation: if it fulfills its  promise, the first fulfillment handler gets run and starts the second operation, returning the promise  secondOperation provides. See Figure 8-2  overleaf .  6 Later you’ll learn about the two-argument version that can also hook into rejection.   188  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  First operation starts, returns a promise; then catch set up the chain   firstOperation    .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-1   firstOperation    ✓  First operation succeeds, handler starts the second  .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-2   Second operation succeeds, handler starts the third  firstOperation    ✓  ✓ .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-3   If the second operation fulfills its promise, that fulfills the promise the first then returned, and the  next fulfillment handler gets run  Figure 8-3 : it starts the third operation and returns the promise of  its result.   If the third operation fulfills its promise, that fulfills the promise from the second then. That calls  the code that uses the third result. Provided that code doesn’t throw or return a rejected promise, the  chain completes  Figure 8-4, opposite . The rejection handler doesn’t get run at all in that case, since  there were no rejections.   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  189  All three operations succeed, chain calls the ﬁnal fulﬁllment handler  firstOperation    .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-4   If the first operation rejects its promise, though, that rejects the promise from the first then, which  rejects the promise from the second then, which rejects the promise from the third then, which calls  the rejection handler at the end. None of the then callbacks get called, because they were for fulfill- ment, not rejection. See Figure 8-5.  firstOperation    First operation fails  .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-5   If the first operation succeeds and its fulfillment handler starts the second operation and returns its  promise, but the second operation fails and rejects its promise, that rejects the promise from the first  then, which rejects the promise from the second then, which rejects the promise from the third then,  which calls the rejection handler. See Figure 8-6.  Similarly, if the first operation succeeds but the   fulfillment handler throws, the same thing happens: the remaining fulfillment handlers are skipped,  and the rejection handler runs.   First operation succeeds but second fails  firstOperation    ✓  .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-6    190  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  Naturally, the same is true if the first and second operations fulfill their promises but the third rejects  its promise  or the handler starting it throws . See Figure 8-7.  If all three operations succeed, the final fulfillment handler is run. If that handler throws, either  directly or by calling a function that throws, the rejection handler gets run. See Figure 8-8.  First and second operations succeed, but third fails  firstOperation    ✓  ✓ .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-7   First, second, and third operations succeed but ﬁnal handler throws  firstOperation    .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult    .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2    .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` * }   .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  FIGURE 8-8   As you can see, a promise chain of this kind is very much like a try catch block around three   synchronous operations  and some final code , like this:     The same logic with synchronous operations try {     const firstResult = firstOperation  ;     const secondResult = secondOperation firstResult ;     const thirdResult = thirdOperation secondResult * 2 ;        Use `thirdResult` here } catch  error  {     console.error error ; }  Just as the separation of the main logic from the error logic is useful in try catch synchronous  code, the separation of the main  fulfillment  logic from the error  rejection  logic in promise chains  is useful.  You can see these various scenarios play out by repeatedly running the basic-promise-chain.js  file from the downloads. That file uses Math.random to give each operation  first, second, and third   a 20% chance of failing, and to give the final fulfillment handler a 20% chance of throwing.   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  191  HANDLERS ARE JUST FUNCTIONS  Handler functions are just functions; there’s nothing special about them. In the  example in this section, I’ve used an arrow function where I didn’t really need to:      firstOperation       .then firstResult => secondOperation firstResult       .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2       .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` *  }      .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  That code could be written like this instead:      firstOperation       .then secondOperation      .then secondResult => thirdOperation secondResult * 2       .then thirdResult => {  * Use `thirdResult` *  }      .catch error => { console.error error ; } ;  There’s no need to wrap secondOperation in an arrow function if you’re just pass- ing the value from the first operation into it; just pass the function reference into  then instead.  Doing that is safe even in the case of a function that accepts optional second, third,  etc. arguments, because promise handler functions always receive exactly one argu- ment: the value  then  or rejection reason  catch . That means you don’t have the  problem that you have with, say, the array map function and parseInt where a =  a.map parseInt  doesn’t work correctly because map calls its callback with three  arguments, not just one, and parseInt accepts an optional second argument.  Comparison with Callbacks  Let’s compare the promise chain from the previous section with using bare callbacks. For this com- parison, let’s assume that the functions starting the asynchronous operations accept a callback: if the  operation succeeds, they call the callback with null as the first argument and the result value as the  second; if the operation fails, they call the callback with an error as the first argument.  This is one  of the more common patterns for callbacks, popularized by Node.js among others.  Here’s how the  previous sequence would look using that convention:  firstOperation  error, firstResult  => {     if  error  {         console.error error ;             Perhaps you'd use `return;` here to avoid the `else`      } else {         secondOperation firstResult,  error, secondResult  => {             if  error  {                 console.error error ;                    Perhaps: `return;`   192  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises              } else {                 thirdOperation secondResult * 2,  error, thirdResult  => {                     if  error  {                         console.error error ;                            Perhaps: `return;`                     } else {                         try {                              * Use `thirdResult` *                          } catch  error  {                             console.error error ;                         }                     }                 } ;             }         } ;     } } ;  You can run this using basic-callback-chain.js from the downloads.  Notice how each step has to be nested in the callback of the previous step. This is the famous “call- back hell,” and part of the reason some programmers use just a two-character indentation—despite  how hard it is to read—so their deeply nested callbacks don’t go off the right of the screen. It’s pos- sible to write that code without having the callbacks nested within one another, but it’s awkward  and verbose.  Really, to be more accurate there would need to be a try catch block around the call to   second Operation and another one around the call to thirdOperation, but I didn’t want to   overcomplicate the example—which underscores the point about how promises make this simpler.  The catch Method  You’ve already learned that the catch method registers a handler that gets called when the promise  gets rejected. Other than that the handler you give it gets called on rejection rather than fulfillment,  catch is exactly like then. With this:  p2 = p1.catch error => doSomethingWith error    catch registers a rejection handler on p1, creating and returning a new promise  p2  that will get  fulfilled or rejected depending on what happens to the original promise  p1  and what you do in  your handler. If p1 gets fulfilled, the handler isn’t called and p2 is fulfilled with p1’s fulfillment  value. If p1 gets rejected, the handler gets called. Here’s what happens to p2 depending on what your  handler does:  ➤➤ If you return a thenable, p2 gets resolved to that thenable. ➤➤ If you return any other value, p2 gets fulfilled with that value. ➤➤ If you use throw, p2 gets rejected using what you threw as the rejection reason.   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  193  Sound familiar? Right! That’s exactly what then does with its handler, which is, in turn, exactly what  the resolve function you get in a promise executor function does. The consistency is useful, you  don’t have to remember different rules for different resolution mechanisms.  One thing to notice in particular is that if you return a non-thenable from the catch handler, the  promise from catch gets fulfilled. That converts the rejection from p1 into a fulfillment of p2. If you  think about it, that’s just like the catch in a try catch: unless you re-throw the error in your catch  block, the catch block stops the error from propagating. The catch method on promises works  the same way.  There’s a slight downside to that: it means you can inadvertently mask errors by putting a catch  handler in the wrong place. Consider:  someOperation       .catch error => {         reportError error ;     }      .then result => {         console.log result.someProperty ;     } ;  With that code, if the operation started by someOperation fails, reportError gets called with the  error  so far, so good , but you’ll get an error in the console that looks something like this:  Uncaught  in promise  TypeError: Cannot read property 'someProperty' of undefined  Why is it trying to read someProperty of undefined? The promise rejected, so why is the then han- dler being called?  Let’s go back to our try catch finally analogue. That code is the logical  not literal  equiva- lent of this:  let result; try {     result = someOperation  ; } catch  error  {     reportError error ;     result = undefined; } console.log result.someProperty ;  The catch caught the error and output it, but didn’t do anything to propagate the error. So the code  after the try catch still runs and tries to use result.someProperty, which fails because result is  undefined.  The promise version is doing the same thing, because the rejection handler caught the error, handled  it, and then didn’t return anything, which is like returning undefined. That fulfilled the promise  from catch with undefined. So that promise called its fulfillment handler, passed in undefined as  result, and when the handler tried to use result.someProperty, it caused a new error.  “But what’s with this ‘unhandled rejection’ thing?” you may be asking. If a promise gets rejected and  no code is in place to handle the rejection, JavaScript engines report an “unhandled rejection” since    194  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  that’s usually a bug. The code in that example doesn’t handle errors from the final fulfillment handler   the one with result.someProperty in it , so when the error trying to use result.someProperty  makes the promise from then reject, it’s an “Unhandled rejection,” since there’s nothing to handle it.  Sometimes, of course, you might want to put a catch in the middle specifically to do exactly that:  handle an error and allow the chain to continue with some substitute value or similar. It’s absolutely  fine if you’re doing it on purpose.  DETECTING UNHANDLED REJECTIONS  The process of determining whether a rejection is handled is fairly complex since it  has to take into account the fact that a rejection handler can be added after the  promise is already rejected. For example, suppose you’re calling an API function that  returns a promise, and it might reject synchronously  during the call to the API  function  because you’ve given it bad argument values, or it might reject asynchro- nously later  because the asynchronous process it starts fails . Your call to it might  look like this:      apiFunction  *...arguments...*       .then result => {            ...use the result...     }      .catch error => {            ...handle report the error...     } ;  If the rejection is caused synchronously, by a bad argument value, the promise is  already rejected before your code gets a chance to attach a rejection handler to it.  But you wouldn’t want the JavaScript engine to complain about it being an unhan- dled rejection, because your code does handle it. The rejection will trigger the code in  your rejection handler that handles reports the error. So it’s not as simple as “It’s time  to reject this promise. Does it have any rejection handlers attached to it?” It’s more  complex than that.  Modern engines do it in a fairly sophisticated way, but may still have the odd false  positive or false negative.  The finally Method  The finally method is, as you’ve learned, very much like the finally block of a try catch   finally. It adds a handler that gets called whether the promise gets fulfilled or rejected  like   a finally block . Like then and catch, it returns a new promise that gets fulfilled or rejected   based on what happens to the original promise and what the finally handler does. But unlike then  and catch, its handler is always called, and the things its handler can do to what’s passing through it  are limited.  Here’s a simple example:  function doStuff   {     spinner.start  ;   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  195      return getSomething           .then result => render result.stuff           .finally    => spinner.stop   ; }  This function starts a spinner spinning to show the user it’s doing something, uses getSomething— a function that returns a promise—to start an asynchronous operation, then shows the result if the  promise gets fulfilled, and stops the spinner no matter what happens to the promise.  Note that this function doesn’t attempt to handle errors; instead, it returns the final promise in the  chain. That’s fairly normal; it allows the calling code to know whether the operation succeeded and  allows error handling to happen at the highest level  often an event handler or similar, e.g., the entry  point into the JavaScript code . By using finally, this code can defer error handling to the caller  while being sure to stop the spinner even when an error occurs.  In the normal case, a finally handler has no effect on the fulfillment or rejection passing through  it  again, like a finally block : any value it returns other than a thenable that is gets rejected is  ignored. But if it throws an error or returns a thenable that rejects, that error rejection supersedes   any fulfillment or rejection passing through it  just like throw in a finally block . So it can’t change  a fulfillment value—not even if it returns a different value—but it can change a rejection reason into a  different rejection reason, it can change a fulfillment into a rejection, and it can delay a fulfillment  by  returning a thenable that is ultimately fulfilled; you’ll see an example in a moment .  Or to put it another way: it’s like a finally block that can’t contain a return statement.7 It might  have a throw or might call a function that throws, but it can’t return a new value.  Run the code in Listing 8-2 to see an example.  LISTING 8-2:  finally returning value—finally-returning-value.js     Function returning promise that gets fulfilled after the given    delay with the given value function returnWithDelay value, delay = 10  {     return new Promise resolve => setTimeout resolve, delay, value  ; }      The function doing the work function doSomething   {     return returnWithDelay "original value"          .finally    => {             return "value from finally";         } ; }   doSomething       .then value => {         console.log "value = " + value ;    "value = original value"     } ;  7 Having a return in a finally block is usually poor practice anyway.   196  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  In that example, doSomething calls returnWithDelay and has a finally handler  in the real world,  it would be for some kind of cleanup . doSomething returns the promise created by calling finally.  The code calls doSomething and uses the promise it returns  the one from finally . Note that the  finally handler returns a value, but the promise from finally doesn’t use that as its fulfillment  value. It uses the value it received from the promise it was called on instead. The return value from  the finally handler wasn’t a thenable, so it was completely ignored.  The reason for preventing a finally handler from changing fulfillments is twofold:  ➤➤ The primary use case of finally is to clean up when you’re done with something, but   without affecting that thing’s result.  ➤➤ Pragmatically, the promise mechanism can’t tell the difference between a function that   doesn’t use return at all  code execution just “falls off the end” of the function , a function  that uses return with no operand, and a function that uses return undefined, because the  result of calling all three of those functions is the same: the value undefined. For example:  function a   { } function b   {     return; } function c   {     return undefined; } console.log a   ;    undefined console.log b   ;    undefined console.log c   ;    undefined  In contrast, in a try catch finally structure, the JavaScript engine can tell the difference  between a finally block where code execution just falls off the end  not affecting the  return value of the function it’s in  and one that issues a return statement. Since the  promise mechanism can’t tell that difference, though, and since the primary purpose of a  finally handler is to do cleanup without changing anything, it makes sense to ignore the  return value of the finally handler.  Just because the handler can’t affect the chain’s fulfillment value doesn’t mean it can’t return a   promise or thenable, however. And if it does, the chain waits for that promise thenable to settle, just  like when then and catch handlers return thenables, since the promise thenable may reject. Run the  code in Listing 8-3 for an example.  LISTING 8-3:  finally returning promise that gets fulfilled—finally-returning-promise.js     Function returning promise that gets fulfilled after the given    delay with the given value function returnWithDelay value, delay = 100  {     return new Promise resolve => setTimeout resolve, delay, value  ; }      The function doing the work function doSomething   {   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  197      return returnWithDelay "original value"          .finally    => {             return returnWithDelay "unused value from finally", 1000 ;         }  }   console.time "example" ; doSomething       .then value => {         console.log "value = " + value ;    "value = original value"         console.timeEnd "example" ;         example: 1100ms  or similar      } ;  Notice that although the value wasn’t changed by the fact the finally handler returned a promise  that was fulfilled later, the chain did wait for that promise to get fulfilled before continuing. It   took roughly 1110ms to complete instead of just 100ms, because of the 1000ms delay from the  returnWithDelay inside the finally handler.  If the thenable the finally handler returns rejects, however, that supersedes the fulfillment; see  Listing 8-4.  LISTING 8-4:  finally causing rejection—finally-causing-rejection.js     Function returning promise that gets fulfilled after the given    delay with the given value function returnWithDelay value, delay = 100  {     return new Promise resolve => setTimeout resolve, delay, value  ; }      Function returning promise that is *rejected* after the given    delay with the given error function rejectWithDelay error, delay = 100  {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => setTimeout reject, delay, error  ; }   console.time "example" ; returnWithDelay "original value"      .finally    => {         return rejectWithDelay new Error "error from finally" , 1000 ;     }      .then value => {            Not called         console.log "value = " + value ;     }      .catch error => {         console.error "error = ", error ;      "error =  Error: error from finally"     }      .finally    => {         console.timeEnd "example" ;            example: 1100ms  or similar      } ;   198  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  throw in then, catch, and finally Handlers  You’ve heard a couple of times in this chapter that if you throw in a then, catch, or finally   handler, it makes the promise created by then catch finally reject with the value you throw. Let’s  look at an example of that from real-world web programming.  On modern browsers, the old XMLHttpRequest object is superseded by the new fetch function,  which returns a promise and is generally simpler to use. In essence, you do fetch url  and it returns  a promise, which gets fulfilled or rejected depending on the success failure of the network operation.  On success, the fulfillment value is a Response object with various properties, as well as methods   which also return promises  for reading the body of the response as text, as an ArrayBuffer  see  Chapter 11 , as text but then parsing it as JSON, as a blob, etc. So naïve use of fetch to, say, retrieve  some data in JSON format tends to look like this:     WRONG fetch " some url"      .then response => response.json        .then data => {            Do something with the data...     }      .catch error => {            Do something with the error     } ;  That’s missing an important step, though. Just as one had to check the result of the status property  when using XMLHttpRequest, one has to check the response status  directly or indirectly  with fetch  as well, because the promise from fetch only rejects when there’s a network error. Anything else—a  404, a 500 server error, etc.—is a fulfillment with that status code, not a rejection, because the net- work operation succeeded even though the HTTP operation failed.  Easily 99.99% of the time you use fetch, though, you don’t care why you didn’t get what you asked  for  whether it was a network error or an HTTP error ; you just care that you didn’t get it. The easi- est way to handle that is to throw an error from the first then handler:  fetch " some url"      .then response => {         if  !response.ok  {             throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;         }         return response.json  ;     } ;     .then data => {            Do something with the data...     }      .catch error => {            Do something with the error     } ;  That then handler converts the fulfillment with an HTTP error into a rejection by checking the  response.ok convenience property  it’s true if the HTTP response status code is a success code,  false otherwise  and using throw if it’s false to do the rejection. Since you almost always want that  check, you’d probably give yourself a utility function that did it. And since error handlers may need  access to the response, you might give yourself a custom Error subclass to provide that, since Error’s  message is a string, something like Listing 8-5  opposite .   Using an Existing Promise  ❘  199  LISTING 8-5:  fetch wrapper converting HTTP errors to rejections—fetch-converting- http-errors.js  class FetchError extends Error {     constructor response, message = "HTTP error " + response.status  {         super message ;         this.response = response;     } } const myFetch =  ...args  => {     return fetch ...args .then response => {         if  !response.ok  {             throw new FetchError response ;         }         return response;     } ; };  With that, you could write the earlier example the obvious way:  myFetch " some url"      .then response => response.json        .then data => {            Do something with the data...     }      .catch error => {            Do something with the error     } ;  The then handler in myFetch converts fulfillment-with-an-HTTP-error to rejection, by using throw  in its handler.  The then Method with Two Arguments  All of the examples of then you’ve seen so far only pass it a single handler. But then can accept two  handlers: one for fulfillment, and another for rejection.  doSomething       .then           *f1*  value => {                Do something with `value`         },          *f2*  error => {                Do something with `error`         }      ;  In that example, if the promise from doSomething gets fulfilled, the first handler is called; if it’s  rejected, the second handler is called.  Using p.then f1, f2  is not the same as using p.then f1 .catch f2 . There’s a big difference:  the two-argument version of then attaches both handlers to the promise you call it on, but using  catch after then attaches the rejection handler to the promise then returns instead. That means that    200  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  with p.then f1, f2 , f2 is only called if p rejects, not if f1 throws an error or returns a promise  that rejects. With p.then f1 .catch f2 , f2 is called if p rejects or if f1 throws an error or returns  a promise that rejects.  BOTH OF THEN’S ARGUMENTS ARE OPTIONAL  If you want to hook up a rejection handler and not hook up a fulfillment handler,  you can do that by passing undefined as the first argument: .then undefined,  rejectionHandler .  “Wait,” you say, “isn’t that what catch is for?” Yes it is. catch is literally just a  wrapper around then, effectively defined like this example using method syntax:      catch onRejected  {         return this.then undefined, onRejected ;     }  finally is also just a wrapper around then, but it has logic in the handlers it passes  to then rather than just passing through the handler it receives like catch does.  The fact that catch and finally are built purely in terms of calls to then  literally,  not just conceptually  will come up again later in this chapter.  Normally, you want just the single-argument version of then, and to chain any rejection handler onto  the promise it returns via catch. But if you only want to handle errors from the original promise and  not from the fulfillment handler, you’d use the two-argument version. For instance, suppose you have  myFetch from the previous section and you want to retrieve some JSON data from the server, sup- plying a default if the server responds with an error, but you don’t want to handle an error  if there is  one  from reading and parsing the JSON  the response.json   call . Using the two-argument then  would make sense for that:  myFetch " get-message"      .then          response => response.json  ,         error =>  {message: "default data"}            .then data => {         doSomethingWith data.message ;     }      .catch error => {            Handle overall error     } ;  Doing that with the single-argument version of then is more awkward. You either end up with your  handler getting called for errors in the call to json by doing a .then ... .catch ... , or you have  to wrap your default in an object with a json function so you can put your catch first:     Awkward version avoiding using the two-argument `then`    Not best practice   Adding Handlers to Already Settled Promises  ❘  201  myFetch " get-message"      .catch    => {         return {json   { return {message: "default data"}; };     }      .then response => response.json        .then data => {         doSomethingWith data.message ;     }      .catch error => {            Handle overall error     } ;  In practice, you usually want the .then f1 .catch f2  structure, but in those relatively rare cases  where you want to handle errors from the then handler differently from a rejection of the original  promise  as in this example , the two-argument version of then is there for you to use.  ADDING HANDLERS TO ALREADY SETTLED PROMISES  In the “Why Promises?” section at the beginning of this chapter, two of the issues with bare call- backs were:  ➤➤ Adding a callback to a process that has already completed is also not standardized. In some   cases, it means the callback is never called; in others, it gets called synchronously; and in  others, it will get called asynchronously. Checking the details for each API you use each  time you need to handle this is time-consuming and easy to forget. The bugs you get when  you assume or misremember are often subtle and hard to find.  ➤➤ Adding multiple callbacks to an operation is either impossible or not standardized.  Promises deal with those by providing standard semantics for adding completion handlers  including  multiple ones , and by guaranteeing two things:  ➤➤ The handler will get called  provided it’s for the appropriate kind of settlement, fulfillment   That means that if you have code that receives a promise from somewhere, and does this:  or rejection .  ➤➤ The call will be asynchronous.  console.log "before" ; thePromise.then    => {     console.log "within" ; } ; console.log "after" ;  the code is guaranteed by the specification to output "before", then "after", and then later  if the  promise gets fulfilled or it’s already fulfilled  "within". If the promise gets fulfilled later, the call to  the fulfillment handler is scheduled later. If the promise is already fulfilled, it’s scheduled  but not  executed  during the call to then. A call to a fulfillment or rejection handler is scheduled by adding  a job for it to the promise job queue; see the “Script Jobs and Promise Jobs” inset for more about job  queues. Run then-on-fulfilled-promise.js from the downloads to see this in action.   202  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  Ensuring that handlers are only ever called asynchronously, even on already settled promises, is the  only way promises themselves make something asynchronous that isn’t already asynchronous.  SCRIPT JOBS AND PROMISE JOBS  Each JavaScript thread in a JavaScript engine runs a loop that services job queues. A  job is a unit of work that the thread will run from beginning to end without running  anything else. There are two standard job queues: script jobs and promise jobs.  Or  as the HTML specification calls them, tasks and microtasks.  Script evaluation,  module evaluation  Chapter 13 , DOM event callbacks, and timer callbacks are  examples of script jobs   tasks  aka “macrotasks” . Promise reactions  calling  promise fulfillment or rejection handlers  are promise jobs   microtasks: when  scheduling a call to a fulfillment or rejection handler, the engine puts a job for that  call in the promise job queue. All of the jobs in the promise job queue are executed  at the end of a script job, before the next script job is run  even if that script job was  added to the script job queue long before the promise job was added to the promise  job queue . That includes promise jobs added by a promise job. For instance, if the  first promise job in the promise jobs queue schedules another promise reaction, that  reaction happens after the promise job that scheduled it, but before the next script  job runs. Conceptually, it looks like this:     Just conceptual, not literal! while  running  {     if  scriptJobs.isEmpty    {         sleepUntilScriptJobIsAdded  ;     }     assert promiseJobs.isEmpty   ;     const scriptJob = scriptJobs.pop  ;     scriptJob.run  ;    May add jobs to promiseJobs and or scriptJobs     while  !promiseJobs.isEmpty    {         const promiseJob = promiseJobs.pop  ;          promiseJob.run  ;    May add jobs to promiseJobs and or scriptJobs     } }  In effect, promise reactions are higher priority than other jobs.   Host environments may have other kinds of jobs as well. For instance, Node.js has  setImmediate, which schedules work in a way that isn’t the same as either a script  job or a promise job.   CREATING PROMISES  There are several ways to create promises. The primary way you create promises is the way you’ve  already learned: using then, catch, or finally on an existing promise. To create a promise when    Creating Promises  ❘  203  you don’t already have one, you can use the Promise constructor or one of a couple of utility  functions.  The Promise Constructor  The Promise constructor creates a promise. There’s a frequent misconception that new Promise  turns a synchronous operation into an asynchronous one. It doesn’t. Promises don’t make operations  asynchronous; they just provide a consistent means of reporting the result of something that’s already  asynchronous.  It’s rare to need to use new Promise. That may seem surprising, but most of the time, you’ll get a  promise some other way:  ➤➤ You’re calling something  an API function, etc.  that returns one. ➤➤ You get one from then, catch, or finally on an existing promise. ➤➤ You get one from a utility function that knows how to convert a particular style of callback  API from that callback style to a promise  which is really just a specific example of the first  bullet point in this list .  ➤➤ You get one from one of the Promise static methods such as Promise.resolve or    Promise.reject, described later in this section.  Any time you already have a promise or a thenable, you don’t need new Promise. Either use then to  chain onto it or, if it’s a thenable and you want a promise, use Promise.resolve  which you’ll learn  about in the next section .  But sometimes you do need to create a promise from scratch. For instance, looking at the third bullet  point in the preceding list, perhaps you’re the one writing a utility function that converts a callback  API to a promise API. Let’s look at that.  Suppose you have some promise-based code, and you need to work with an API function that doesn’t  provide a promise; instead, it accepts an object containing options, and two of those options are   callbacks for success and failure:  const noop =    => {};    A function that does nothing  * Does something.  * @param   data        The data to do something with  * @param   time        The time to take  * @param   onSuccess   Callback for success, called with two arguments:  *                      the result, and a status code  * @param   onError     Callback for failure, called with one argument  *                       an error message as a string .  *  function doSomething { data, time = 10, onSuccess = noop, onError = noop} = {}  {        ... }  Since your code is promise-based it would be useful to have a promise-based version of doSomething.  You might write a wrapper for it that looks like promiseSomething in Listing 8-6.  Hopefully you’d  give it a better name than that, though.    204  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  LISTING 8-6:  Wrapper for mock API function—mock-api-function-wrapper.js  function promiseSomething options = {}  {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         doSomething {             ...options,                Since `doSomething` calls `onSuccess` with two                arguments, we need to wrap them up in an object                to pass to `resolve`             onSuccess result, status  {                 resolve {result, status} ;             },                `doSomething` calls `onError` with a string error,                wrap it in an Error instance             onError message  {                 reject new Error message  ;             }         } ;     } ; }  You may recall from the beginning of the chapter that the function you pass into the Promise con- structor is called an executor function. It’s responsible for starting the process for which the Promise  will report success or failure. The Promise constructor calls the executor synchronously, meaning that  the code in the executor function runs before promiseSomething returns the promise.  You saw an executor function early on in this chapter, and of course just now in Listing 8-6. To recap,  an executor function receives two arguments: the function to call to resolve the promise  typically  given the name resolve, but you can call it anything you want , and the function to call to reject the  promise  typically given the name reject . Nothing can settle the promise unless it has access to one  of those two functions. Each accepts a single parameter: resolve accepts a thenable  in which case it  resolves the promise to that thenable  or a non-thenable value  in which case it fulfills the promise ;  reject accepts the rejection reason  error . If you call either of them with no arguments, undefined  is used for the value or rejection reason. If you call either of them with more than one argument, only  the first argument is used; any others are ignored. Finally, after you’ve called resolve or reject the  first time, calling either of them again does nothing. It doesn’t raise an error, but the call is completely  ignored. That’s because once a promise is resolved  fulfilled or resolved to a thenable  or rejected, you  can’t change that. The resolution or rejection is set in stone.  Let’s look at what the executor function in Listing 8-6 does:  ➤➤ It creates a new options object and uses property spread  which you learned about in  Chapter 5  to give it the properties from the options object passed in, adding its own   onSuccess and onError functions.  ➤➤ For onSuccess, the code uses a function that takes the two arguments it’s given and creates  an object with result and status properties, then calls resolve with that object to fulfill  the promise and set the object as the fulfillment value.  ➤➤ For onError, the code uses a function that takes the string error message from    doSomething, wraps it in an Error instance, and calls reject with that error.   Creating Promises  ❘  205  Now, you can use promiseSomething in your promise-based code:  promiseSomething {data: "example"}      .then  {result, status}  => {         console.log "Got:", result, status ;     }      .catch error => {         console.error error ;     } ;  For a full runnable example, run full-mock-api-function-example.js from the downloads.  Note that unlike resolve, reject doesn’t work differently if you give it a thenable. It always takes  what you give it and makes it the rejection reason. It always makes the promise reject; it doesn’t  resolve the promise to what you pass it like resolve does. Even if you pass it a thenable, it doesn’t  wait for that thenable to settle; it uses the thenable itself as the rejection reason. For example,  this code:  new Promise  resolve, reject  => {     const willReject = new Promise  resolve2, reject2  => {         setTimeout    => {             reject2 new Error "rejected"  ;         }, 100 ;     } ;     reject willReject ; }  .catch error => {     console.error error ; } ;  passes the willReject promise to the catch handler immediately, without waiting for it to set- tle.  Then, 100ms later, it causes an unhandled rejection error because nothing handles the fact that  willReject rejected.   That’s a big difference between resolve and reject. While resolve resolves the promise, including  possibly resolving it to another promise or thenable  which may involve waiting for that other prom- ise thenable to settle , reject will only ever reject the promise immediately.  Promise.resolve  Promise.resolve x  is effectively shorthand for:  x instanceof Promise ? x : new Promise resolve => resolve x    except that in Promise.resolve x , x is only evaluated once. It returns its argument directly if that  argument is an instance of Promise  not just a thenable ; otherwise, it creates a new promise and  resolves that promise to the value you gave it—meaning that if the value is a thenable, the promise is  resolved to that thenable, and if the value isn’t a thenable the promise is fulfilled with that value.  Promise.resolve is quite handy for converting a thenable into a native promise, since the promise   it returns settles depending on how the thenable gets settled. It’s also useful if you’re accepting   something, let’s call it x, that could be a promise, a thenable, or a plain value: you pass it through  Promise.resolve:  x = Promise.resolve x ;   and then it’s always a promise. For example, suppose you want a utility function that logs a value,  either the value itself or, if it’s a thenable, its fulfillment value or rejection reason. You’d run the  parameter through Promise.resolve:  206  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  function pLog x  {     Promise.resolve x      .then value => {         console.log value ;     }      .catch error => {         console.error error ;     } ; }  Then you can call it either with a simple value:  pLog 42 ;    => 42  after a "tick" because it's guaranteed to be asynchronous   or with a promise or other thenable:  pLog new Promise resolve => setTimeout resolve, 1000, 42   ;    => 42  after ~1000ms   Since the promise thenable may reject, the promise from Promise.resolve may also reject:  pLog new Promise  resolve, reject  => {     setTimeout reject, 1000, new Error "failed"  ;   ;    => error: failed  after ~1000ms   Another use case is priming a series of promise-enabled asynchronous operations, where each chains  on the fulfillment of the previous one. You’ll learn more about that in the section “Promises in Series,”  later in this chapter .  Promise.reject  Promise.reject x  is shorthand for:  new Promise  resolve, reject  => reject x    That is, it creates a promise rejected with the rejection reason you give it.  Promise.reject isn’t as general-purpose as Promise.resolve, but one common use case for it is in  a then handler when you want to convert fulfillment to rejection. Some programmers prefer to return  a rejected promise, like this:  .then value => {     if  value == null  {         return Promise.reject new Error   ;     }     return value; }   Other Promise Utility Methods  ❘  207  rather than using throw, like this:  .then value => {     if  value == null  {         throw new Error  ;     }     return value; }  They both end up doing the same thing, but for reasons of personal style, you may see   Promise.reject used for this, particularly when it means a concise arrow function can be  used instead of a verbose one. For instance, the example earlier could be written with a concise  arrow function:  .then value => value == null ? Promise.reject new Error    : value ;  You can’t use throw in a concise arrow function  yet , because throw is a statement, and the body of  a concise arrow function is a single expression.  throw expressions8 are an active proposal, though, so  that may change.   OTHER PROMISE UTILITY METHODS  Promise.resolve and Promise.reject aren’t the only promise utility functions available; there are  several more that we’ll look at in this section.  Promise.all  Suppose you have three asynchronous operations you need to perform that don’t rely on each other,  so it’s fine if they overlap with one another, and you only want to use the results when you have the  results from all three. If you used a promise chain, they’d run sequentially. So how to wait for them?  You could start each of them, remember its promise, and then call then on them sequentially, but it  gets pretty ugly:  let p1 = firstOperation  ; let p2 = secondOperation  ; let p3 = thirdOperation  ; p1.then firstResult => {     return p2.then secondResult => {         return p3.then thirdResult => {                Use `firstResult`, `secondResult`, and `thirdResult` here         } ;     } ; }  .catch error  {        Handle error } ;  Promise.all to the rescue! Promise.all accepts an iterable  such as an array  and waits for any  thenables in it to settle, returning a promise that either A  gets fulfilled when all of the thenables   in the iterable are fulfilled, or B  gets rejected as soon as any of them gets rejected. When it gets   8 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-throw-expressions   208  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  fulfilled, the fulfillment value is an array that has the fulfillment values of the thenables along with  any non-thenable values from the original iterable, in the same order as the iterable it was called with.  When it gets rejected, it uses the rejection reason of the thenable that got rejected  which, remember,  is the first thenable that rejected .  You can wait for those three operations that can run in parallel with Promise.all like this:  Promise.all [firstOperation  , secondOperation  , thirdOperation  ]      .then  [firstResult, secondResult, thirdResult]  => {            Use `firstResult`, `secondResult`, and `thirdResult` here     }      .catch error => {            Handle error     } ;      It doesn’t matter if secondOperation completes before firstOperation. Promise.all ensures the  fulfillment values are in the same order as the thenables it receives; the result of the first thenable is  always the first in the array, the result of the second is always the second, etc. Similarly, any non-  thenable values in the original iterable are in the same place in the result array. See Figure 8-9.  Input Values  0: "one" 1: thenableA 2: thenableB 3: "two"  FIGURE 8-9   Fulfillment Array  0: "one" 1: fulfillment value from thenableA 2: fulfillment value from thenableB 3: "two"  Notice the use of destructuring in the then handler in the example earlier. If you’re working with  a known number of entries in the iterable you pass to Promise.all, as opposed to something you  create dynamically with an unknown number of entries, using destructuring in the then handler can  improve the clarity of the code. But it’s entirely optional.  If you call Promise.all with an empty iterable, its promise gets fulfilled immediately with an  empty array.  If any of the thenables rejects, the promise from Promise.all rejects with just that rejection reason,  without waiting for the other thenables to settle. It doesn’t give you access to any fulfillments that  may have occurred prior to the rejection nor, of course, any fulfillments or rejections that happen  afterward. It does, however, silently “handle” rejections after the first, so they don’t cause unhandled  rejection errors.  Remember that any non-thenable values just get passed through. That’s because Promise.all passes  all of the values from the iterable through Promise.resolve when it receives them, then uses the  resulting promises. For example, if you had just two operations to run and a third value you wanted  to pass with them, you could do that like this:  Promise.all [firstOperation  , secondOperation  , 42]      .then  [a, b, c]  => {            Use `a`, `b`, and `c` here            `c` will be 42 in this example   Other Promise Utility Methods  ❘  209      }      .catch error => {            Handle error     } ;  The value doesn’t have to be at the end; it can be anywhere:  Promise.all [firstOperation  , 42, secondOperation  ]      .then  [a, b, c]  => {            Use `a`, `b`, and `c` here            `b` will be 42 in this example     }      .catch error => {            Handle error     } ;  Promise.race  Promise.race accepts an iterable of values  usually thenables  and watches them race, providing a  promise for the result of the race. The promise gets fulfilled as soon as the first thenable gets fulfilled,  or rejected as soon as the first thenable gets rejected, using the fulfillment value or rejection reason  from that “winning” promise. Like Promise.all, it passes the values from the iterator through   Promise.resolve, so non-thenables work as well.  Timeouts are one use case for Promise.race. Suppose you need to fetch something with a timeout,  but the fetch mechanism you’re using doesn’t provide a timeout feature. You can run a race between  the fetch and a timer:      Assume timeoutAfter returns a promise that gets rejected with a    timeout error after the given number of milliseconds  Promise.race [fetchSomething  , timeoutAfter 1000 ]      .then data => {            Do something with the data     }      .catch error => {            Handle the error or timeout     } ;  When the timeout wins the race, that doesn’t stop the fetch operation, but it ignores it when the fetch  operation eventually finishes  either way  later. Of course, if the fetch mechanism you’re using sup- ports a timeout, or a way to cancel it, you’ll want to use that instead.  Promise.allSettled  Promise.allSettled passes all of the values from the iterable you give it through   Promise.resolve and waits for all of them to settle, whether getting fulfilled or rejected, and  returns an array of objects with a status property and either a value or reason property. If the  status property is "fulfilled", the promise was fulfilled, and the object’s value has the fulfill- ment value. If the status is "rejected", the promise was rejected, and reason has the rejection  reason.  If you check status, ensure you spell "fulfilled" correctly; it’s easy to mistakenly  include a second “l” on “ful”.    210  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  As with Promise.all, the array will be in the same order as the iterable that was provided, even if  the thenables settle out of order.  Here’s an example:  Promise.allSettled [Promise.resolve "v" , Promise.reject new Error "e"  ]  .then results => {     console.log results ; } ;    Outputs something similar to:    [        {status: "fulfilled", value: "v"},        {status: "rejected", reason: Error "e" }    ]  Promise.any  Promise.any,9 Stage 3 as of this writing, is the converse of Promise.all. Like Promise.all, it  accepts an iterable of values it passes through Promise.resolve and returns a promise. But while  Promise.all defines success  fulfillment  as “all the thenables got fulfilled,” Promise.any defines   success as “any of the thenables got fulfilled.” It fulfills its promise with the fulfillment value of the   first thenable that got fulfilled. If all of the thenables get rejected, it rejects its promise with an  Aggregate Error whose errors property is an array of rejection reasons. Like Promise.all’s array  of fulfillment values, the array of rejection reasons is always in the same order as the values from the  iterable it received.  PROMISE PATTERNS  In this section, you’ll learn some patterns that are helpful when working with promises.  Handle Errors or Return the Promise  One fundamental rule of promises is: Either handle errors, or propagate the promise chain  e.g., by  returning the latest result of then, catch, or finally  to your caller. Breaking this rule is likely the  largest source of program incorrectness when using promises.  Suppose you have a function that fetches and shows an updated score when called:  function showUpdatedScore id  {     myFetch "getscore?id=" + id .then displayScore ; }  What if myFetch runs into a problem? Nothing handles that promise rejection. In a browser, that  unhandled rejection will be reported in the console. On Node.js it’s reported in the console, and may   9 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-promise-any   Promise Patterns  ❘  211  terminate the program entirely.10 Moreover, whatever called showUpdatedScore doesn’t know it  didn’t work. Instead, showUpdatedScore should return the promise from then:  function showUpdatedScore id  {     return myFetch "getscore?id=" + id .then displayScore ; }  Then, whatever is calling it can handle errors or pass on the chain as necessary  perhaps in   combination with other asynchronous operations it’s doing . For instance:  function showUpdates scoreId, nameId  {     return Promise.all [showUpdatedScore scoreId , showUpdatedName nameId ] ; }  Every layer needs to either handle rejections or return a promise to its caller, expecting the caller to  handle rejections. The top level has to do the rejection handling, since it has nothing it can pass the  chain onto:  button.addEventListener "click",    => {     const {scoreId, nameId} = this.dataset;     showUpdatedScore scoreId, nameId .catch reportError ; }  With synchronous exceptions, the propagation is built into the mechanism. With promises, you need  to ensure that the propagation happens by returning the last promise in the chain. But don’t despair!  In Chapter 9, you’ll see how it becomes automatic again in an async function.  Promises in Series  If you have a series of operations that need to happen one after another, and want to either collect all  their results or just feed each result into the next operation, there’s a handy way to do that: construct  a chain of promises using a loop. You start with an array  or any iterable  of the functions you want  to call  or if you’re calling the same function in every case, an array iterable of arguments you want  to call it with , and loop through the array to create a promise chain, chaining each operation on the  fulfillment of the previous one via then. You start out with a call to Promise.resolve passing in the  initial value.  A lot of people do this using the reduce function on arrays, so let’s quickly recap the concept of  reduce: it takes a callback and a seed value  the way we’re using it here  and calls the callback with  the seed value and the first entry in the array, then calls the callback again with the return value   from the first call and the next entry in the array, repeatedly until it finishes the array, returning the  final result from the callback. So this reduce call:  console.log ["a", "b", "c"].reduce  acc, entry  => acc + " " + entry, "String:"  ; console.log value ;    "String: a b c"  10  That’s the plan as of this writing, anyway. For the moment, Node.js v13 still just shows a warning when the unhandled   rejection is detected saying that in some future version, unhandled rejections will terminate the process.   212  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  calls the callback with "String:"  the seed value  and "a"  the first array entry , then calls it   again with "String: a"  the result of the previous call  and "b"  the next array entry , then calls   it again with "String: a b"  the result of the previous call  and "c"  the last array entry , then  returns the final result: "String: a b c". It does the same thing this code does:  const callback =  acc, entry  => acc + " " + entry; callback callback callback "String:", "a" , "b" , "c"  console.log value ;    "String: a b c"  but more flexibly, because it can handle however many entries there are in the array.  Let’s apply that to promises. Suppose you have a function that passes a value through a series of  configurable transformation functions  like middleware in a web server process, or a series of image  data filters :  function handleTransforms value, transforms  {        ... }  Since the list of transforms varies from call to call, it’s provided as an array of transform functions.  Each function accepts a value to transform and produces the transformed value, either synchronously  or asynchronously. If it’s asynchronous, it returns a promise. Creating a promise chain in a loop  works well for this task: you use the initial value as the seed value for the reduce accumulator, and  loop through the functions, chaining the promises together. Something like this:  function handleTransforms value, transforms  {     return transforms.reduce           p, transform  => p.then v => transform v  ,    The callback         Promise.resolve value                           The seed value      ; }  Code using reduce can be a bit tricky to read, though; let’s look at a version that does the same thing  using a for-of loop:  function handleTransforms value, transforms  {     let chain = Promise.resolve value ;     for  const transform of transforms  {         chain = chain.then v => transform v  ;     }     return chain; }   The arrow functions in the two preceding examples could be removed, instead of   .then v => transform v   you could just write .then transform .   Let’s assume we call handleTransforms with the transform functions a, b, and c. Whether you’re  using the reduce code or the for-of code, handleTransforms sets up the chain and then returns  before any of the callbacks runs  because the then on the promise from Promise.resolve has the  guarantee that it will only run its callback asynchronously . Then, this happens:  ➤➤ Almost immediately, the first callback gets run. It passes the initial value into a, which  returns either a value or a promise. That resolves the promise from the first call to then.   Promise Patterns  ❘  213  ➤➤ That fulfillment calls the callback to the second then, passing the value that a returned into   b and returning b’s result. That resolves the promise from the second call to then.  ➤➤ That fulfillment calls the callback to the third then, passing the value that b returned into c   and returning c’s result. That resolves the promise from the third call to then.  The caller sees the final promise, which will either get fulfilled with the final value from c or rejected  with a rejection reason supplied by either a, b, or c.  In Chapter 9 you’ll learn about the async functions added in ES2018. With async functions, the loop  is even clearer  once you know what that await thing is . Here’s a sneak peak:     `async` functions are covered in Chapter 9 async function handleTransforms value, transforms  {     let result = value;     for  const transform of transforms  {         result = await transform result ;     }     return result; }  Promises in Parallel  To run a group of operations in parallel, start them one at a time building up an array  or other   iterable  of the promises each returns, and use Promise.all to wait for them all to complete.  See   the earlier section on Promise.all.   For instance, if you had an array of URLs, all of which you wanted to fetch, and you were happy to  fetch them all in parallel, you might use map to start the fetch operations and get promises for them,  then Promise.all to wait for the results:  Promise.all arrayOfURLs.map      url => myFetch url .then response => response.json       .then results => {        Use the array of results     console.log results ; }  .catch error => {        Handle the error     console.error error ; } ;  Given the note at the end of the “Promises in Series” section earlier, you’re probably wondering  whether async functions make this a lot simpler, too. The answer is: somewhat, but you still use  Promise.all. Here’s a sneak peak:     this code must be in an `async` function  Chapter 9  try {     const results = await Promise.all arrayOfURLs.map          url => myFetch url .then response => response.json          ;   214  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises         Use the array of results     console.log results ; } catch  error  {        Handle report the error     console.error error ; }  PROMISE ANTI-PATTERNS  In this section, you’ll learn about some common promise-related anti-patterns to avoid.  Unnecessary new Promise  *...*    Programmers who are new to promises frequently write code like this:     INCORRECT function getData id  {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         myFetch " url for data?id=" + id              .then response => response.json                .then data => resolve data               .catch error => reject error  ;     } ; }  function getData id  {     return myFetch " url for data?id=" + id              .then response => response.json   ; }  Not Handling Errors  or Not Properly   or various permutations of it. As you know, though, then and catch already return promises, so  there’s no need for the new Promise there at all. The preceding should just be written like this:  Not handling errors, or not handling errors properly, is hardly unique to using promises. But whereas  exceptions automatically propagate through the call stack until unless handled by a catch block,  promise rejections don’t, leading to hidden errors.  Or they were hidden errors, until JavaScript envi- ronments started reporting unhandled rejections.   Remember the rule from the earlier section on promise patterns: the fundamental rule of promises is  either handle errors, or propagate the promise chain to the caller so the caller can handle them.  Letting Errors Go Unnoticed When Converting a Callback API  When wrapping a callback API in a promise wrapper, it’s easy to accidentally allow errors to  go unhandled. For instance, consider this hypothetical wrapper for an API returning rows from  a database:     INCORRECT function getAllRows query  {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {   Promise Anti-Patterns  ❘  215          query.execute  err, resultSet  => {             if  err  {                 reject err ;    or `reject new Error err  ` or similar             } else {                 const results = [];                 while  resultSet.next    {                     data.push resultSet.getRow   ;                 }                 resolve results ;             }         } ;     } ; }  At first glance that looks reasonable. It does the query, and if the query returns an error it uses it to  reject; if not, it builds an array of results and fulfills its promise with them.  But what if resultSet.next   throws an error? Perhaps the underlying database connection died.  That would terminate the callback, meaning neither resolve nor reject is ever called, most likely  failing silently, and leaving the promise unsettled forever.  Instead, ensure errors in the callback are caught and turned into a rejection:  function getAllRows query  {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         query.execute  err, resultSet  => {             try {                 if  err  {                     throw err;    or `throw new Error err ` or similar                 }                 const results = [];                 while  resultSet.next    {                     data.push resultSet.getRow   ;                 }                 resolve results ;             } catch  error  {                 reject error ;             }         } ;     } ; }  You don’t need the try catch around the call to query.execute because if an error is thrown by  the promise executor function itself  rather than a callback later , the Promise constructor uses that  error to reject the promise automatically.  Implicitly Converting Rejection to Fulfillment  Programmers new to promises who’ve heard the fundamental rule  handle errors or return the  promise chain  sometimes mishear it as “... and return the promise chain” and end up writing code  like this:  function getData id  {     return myFetch " url for data?id=" + id    216  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises              .then response => response.json                .catch error => {                 reportError error ;             } ; }  Do you see the problem with that code?  It’s a bit subtle.   The problem is that if an error occurs, getData’s promise will be fulfilled with the value undefined,  never rejected. The catch handler has no return value, so calling it results in the value undefined,  and that means the promise catch created gets fulfilled with the value undefined, not rejected. That  makes getData quite awkward to use: any then handler on it has to check whether it got undefined  or the data it asked for.  The rule is “... or return the promise chain,” and that’s what getData should do:  function getData id  {     return myFetch " url for data?id=" + id              .then response => response.json   ; }  That allows the caller to use then and catch on the result, knowing that the then handler will  receive the data and the catch handler will receive rejections.  Trying to Use Results Outside the Chain  Programmers new to asynchronous programming frequently write code like this:  let result; startSomething   .then response => {     result = response.result; } ; doSomethingWith result ;  The problem here is that result will be undefined when doSomethingWith result ; runs,  because the callback to then is asynchronous. Instead, the call to doSomethingWith should be inside  the then callback  and of course, the code needs to either handle rejection or return the promise  chain to something that will :  startSomething   .then response => {     doSomethingWith response.result ; }  .catch reportError ;  Using Do-Nothing Handlers     INCORRECT startSomething   .then value => value   When first using promises, some programmers write do-nothing handlers, like this:   Promise Anti-Patterns  ❘  217  .then response => {     doSomethingWith response.data ; }  .catch error => { throw error; } ;  Two out of three of those handlers are pointless  and there’s another problem with that code as  shown . Which are they?  Right! If you’re not changing the value in some way or using it for something, you don’t need a then  handler; and throwing an error from a catch handler just rejects the promise catch created. So  the first then call and the catch call don’t do anything. The code could be just this  which still has  a problem :  startSomething   .then response => {     doSomethingWith response.data ; } ;  As an aside, have you spotted the remaining problem? It’s a bit tricky to see it without more context,  but the problem is that it needs to handle errors, or return the chain to something that will.  Branching the Chain Incorrectly  Another common problem when starting out is branching the chain incorrectly, like this:  The problem here is that errors from the then handler aren’t handled, because catch is called on the  original promise, not the promise from then. If handleError should be called both for errors from  the original promise and also errors from the then handler, that should be written just as a chain:  If the reason the author wrote it the other way is that they want to handle errors from the fulfillment  handler differently than errors from the original promise, there are a couple of ways to do it. There’s  the two-argument version of then:     INCORRECT const p = startSomething  ; p.then response => {     doSomethingWith response.result ; } ; p.catch handleError ;  startSomething   .then response => {     doSomethingWith response.result ; }  .catch handleError ;  startSomething   .then      response => {         doSomethingWith response.result ;     },     handleErrorFromOriginalPromise   .catch handleErrorFromThenHandler ;   218  ❘  CHAPTER 8    Promises  That assumes handleErrorFromOriginalPromise never throws and doesn’t return a promise that  gets rejected .  Or, you can add a rejection handler to the original structure, perhaps reordered a bit:  const p = startSomething  ; p.catch handleErrorFromOriginalPromise ; p.then response => {     doSomethingWith response.result ; }  .catch handleErrorFromThenHandler ;  PROMISE SUBCLASSES  You can create your own subclasses of Promise in the usual ways. For instance, by using the class  syntax you learned about in Chapter 4:  class MyPromise extends Promise {        ...custom functionality here... }  When doing so, it’s important not to break the various fundamental guarantees that promises pro- vide. For instance, don’t override the then method and have it call the handler synchronously when  the promise is already fulfilled; that breaks the guarantee that the handler will always be called asyn- chronously. If you did that, your subclass would be a valid thenable, but it wouldn’t be a promise,  which breaks the “is a” rule of subclassing.  NOTE  Creating a promise subclass isn’t something you’re likely to want   to do, not least because it’s so easy to accidentally end up dealing with a  native promise instead of your subclass. For instance, if dealing with an   API that provides promises, to use your promise subclass you have to   wrap the promise from that API in your subclass  typically by using   YourPromiseSubclass.resolve theNativePromise  . That said, provided  you subclass Promise correctly, you can trust that the promises you get from  its own methods will be instances of your subclass.  Since then, catch, finally, Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, Promise.all, and so on all  return promises, you may be concerned that if you create a subclass, you’ll need to override all of the  Promise methods. Good news! The implementations of Promise’s methods are smart: they make sure  that they create their new promise using the subclass. In fact, the empty MyPromise shell shown at  the beginning of this section is fully functional, and calling then  or catch or finally  on instances  of MyPromise  or using MyPromise.resolve, MyPromise.reject, etc.  returns a new instance of  MyPromise that behaves correctly. You don’t have to explicitly implement anything:  class MyPromise extends Promise { } const p1 = MyPromise.resolve 42 ;   Old Habits to New  ❘  219  const p2 = p1.then    => {  *...* } ; console.log p1 instanceof MyPromise ;    true console.log p2 instanceof MyPromise ;    true  If you decide to subclass Promise, here are some things to keep in mind:  ➤➤ There shouldn’t be any need to define your own constructor, the default one is sufficient.   But if you define the constructor:  ➤➤ Make sure you pass the first argument  the executor function  to super  . ➤➤ Make sure you don’t expect to receive any other arguments  because you won’t   receive any from the implementations of Promise methods that use the constructor,  such as then .  ➤➤ If you override then, catch, or finally, make sure you don’t break the fundamental    guarantees they provide  for instance, don’t execute the handler synchronously .  ➤➤ Remember that then is the central method of promise instances. catch and finally call   then to do their work  literally, not just conceptually . If you need to hook into the process  of hooking up handlers to the promise, you only need to override then.  ➤➤ If you override then, remember that it has two parameters  conventionally called    onFulfilled and onRejected , and both of them are optional.  ➤➤ If you create new methods that create promises, don’t call your own constructor   directly  e.g., new MyPromise   ; that’s unfriendly to subclasses. Instead,   either use the Symbol.species pattern you learned about in Chapter 4  use new   this.constructor[Symbol.species]  *...*   in an instance method or new  this[Symbol.species]  *...*   in a static method  or just directly use   new this.constructor  *...*   in an instance method and new this  *...*    in a static method. The native Promise class does the latter, it doesn’t use the  species pattern.  ➤➤ Similarly, if you want to use MyPromise.resolve or MyPromise.reject in a MyPromise  method’s code, don’t use them directly, use this.constructor.resolve reject in an in- stance method or this.resolve reject in a static method.  Again, though, it’s unlikely that you’ll really need to subclass Promise.  OLD HABITS TO NEW  There’s really just the one “Old Habit” to consider changing here.  Use Promises Instead of Success Failure Callbacks  Old habit: Having a function that starts a one-off asynchronous process accept a callback  or two, or  three  to report success, failure, and completion.  New habit: Return a promise instead, explicitly or implicitly via an async function  which you’ll  learn about in Chapter 9 .    Asynchronous Functions,  Iterators, and Generators  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ async functions  ➤➤ await operator  ➤➤ async iterators and generators  ➤➤ for-await-of statement  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode  or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter you’ll learn about ES2018’s async functions and the await operator, which  provide syntax for writing asynchronous code using the same familiar flow control structures  you use when writing synchronous code  for loops, if statements, try catch finally, call- ing functions and waiting for their results, etc. . You’ll also learn about async iterators, async  generators, and the for-await-of statement.  Because async functions build on promises, if you haven’t already read Chapter 8, you’ll want  to do that now before moving on to this chapter.   222  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors  ASYNC FUNCTIONS  In some sense, async await syntax is “just” syntactic sugar for creating and consuming promises,  and yet it completely transforms how you write your asynchronous code, letting you write the logical  flow rather than writing only the synchronous flow and using callbacks for the asynchronous parts.  async await fundamentally changes, and simplifies, writing asynchronous code.  In a non-async function, you’re writing a series of operations that the JavaScript engine will carry  out, in order, without allowing anything else to happen while it’s doing so  see the “Single Thread Per  Realm” inset . That code might pass a callback to something that will call it asynchronously later, but  the code doing that is just passing in the function to call later, the call isn’t done right away.  For example, consider this code  assume all of these functions are synchronous :  function example   {     let result = getSomething  ;     if  result.flag  {         doSomethingWith result ;     } else {         reportAnError  ;     } }  In example, the code calls getSomething, checks a flag on the object it got back, and then either calls  doSomethingWith passing in the object, or calls reportAnError. All of that happens one thing after  the last , with nothing else happening in the meantime.1  SINGLE THREAD PER REALM  Earlier when I said the engine carries out the steps of a non-async function   “ . . . without allowing anything else to happen while it’s doing so . . . ” there’s an  implicit “ . . . on that thread . . . ” qualifier. JavaScript defines semantics for only a  single thread per realm  such as a browser tab , sometimes sharing that one thread  across multiple realms  such as multiple tabs in a browser from the same origin that  can directly call each other’s code . That means that only a single thread has direct  access to the variables and such being used by your code.  Chapter 16 explains how  SharedArrayBuffer lets you share data across threads, but not variables.  While  there are some JavaScript environments that allow multiple threads in the same  realm  the Java Virtual Machine is one example, running JavaScript via scripting  support , they’re very rare and there are no standard semantics for them in  JavaScript. For this chapter, please assume the standard type of environment such as  you’d find in Node.js or a browser where there’s only a single thread in the realm.  1  Other than that, any thread can be suspended  paused  by the environment. What can’t happen is that the thread then   does other work in this same JavaScript realm.   async Functions  ❘  223  Before async functions, doing similar things with asynchronous operations involved passing around  callbacks, perhaps promise callbacks. For example, using fetch  the XMLHttpRequest replacement  on modern browsers , in a non-async function you might have this code:  function getTheData spinner  {     spinner.start  ;     return fetch " some resource"          .then response => {             if  !response.ok  {                 throw new Error "HTTP status " + response.status ;             }             return response.json  ;         }          .then data => {             useData  ;             return data;         }          .finally    => {             spinner.stop  ;         } ; }  That will call spinner.start, then call fetch, then call then on the promise it returns, then call  then on the promise that returns, then call finally on the promise that returns, and return the  promise from finally. All of that happens in an unbroken series with nothing else happening in  between. Later, when the request completes, those callbacks get run, but that’s after getTheData  has returned. After getTheData returns and before those operations complete, the thread can do  other things.  Here’s that same code in an async function:  async function getTheData spinner  {     spinner.start  ;     try {         let response = await fetch " some resource" ;         if  !response.ok  {             throw new Error "HTTP status " + response.status ;         }         let data = await response.json  ;         useData data ;         return data;     } finally {         spinner.stop  ;     } }  The code looks synchronous, doesn’t it? But it isn’t. It has places where it pauses and waits for an  asynchronous process to complete. While it’s waiting, the thread can do other things. Those places are  marked by the await keyword.  The four key features of async functions are:  ➤➤ async functions implicitly create and return promises. ➤➤ In an async function, await consumes promises, marking a point where the code will wait   asynchronously for the promise to settle.   224  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors  ➤➤ While the function is waiting for the promise to settle, the thread can run other code. ➤➤ In an async function, code you’ve traditionally seen as synchronous  for loops, a + b,   try catch finally, etc.  is asynchronous if it contains await. The logic is the same, but the  timing is different: there can be execution pauses to allow the awaited promise to settle.  ➤➤ Exceptions are rejections, and rejections are exceptions; returns are resolutions, and fulfill- ments are results  that is, if you await a promise, you see the promise’s fulfillment value as  the result of the await expression .  Let’s look at each of those in more detail.  async Functions Create Promises  An async function creates and returns a promise under the covers, resolving or rejecting that   promise based on the code within the function. The following is an indicative translation of how the  getTheData async function shown earlier is handled conceptually by the JavaScript engine. It’s not  literally correct, but it’s close enough to get an idea of how the engine handles it.     NOT how you would write this yourself function getTheData spinner  {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         spinner.start  ;            This inner promise's executor function is the `try` block         new Promise tryResolve => {             tryResolve                  Promise.resolve fetch " some resource"                   .then response => {                     if  !response.ok  {                         throw new Error "HTTP status " + response.status ;                     }                     return Promise.resolve response.json                            .then data => {                             useData data ;                             return data;                         } ;                 }               ;         }          .finally    => {             spinner.stop  ;         }          .then resolve, reject ;     } ; }  That’s not how you’d write it if you were writing it with promises directly, not least because—as you  learned in Chapter 8—you don’t need new Promise when you already have the promise from fetch.  But it’s a reasonable indication of how an async function works under the covers.  Notice that the part of that async function prior to the first await  the call to spinner.start and  the call to fetch  is synchronous: in the translated version, it’s been relocated into promise executor    async Functions  ❘  225  functions, which are called synchronously. This is an important part of how an async function  works: it creates its promise and runs its code synchronously until the first await or return  or the  logic falls off the end of the function . If that synchronous code throws, the async function rejects its  promise. Once the synchronous code has completed  normally or with an error , the async function  returns its promise to the caller. That’s so it can synchronously start a process that will complete asyn- chronously, just like a promise executor function does.  Your first reaction to the “translated” code, having read Chapter 8 and in particular its section on  anti-patterns, might well be “But that uses new Promise  twice! . It should just chain off the promise  from fetch.” That’s true, but the way async functions work has to be generic enough to allow for  the possibility your code never uses await and so there’s no promise to chain from, although there’s  little reason to use an async function that never awaits. This example also has to ensure that the  finally handler runs if there’s an exception calling fetch, which it wouldn’t if the function just  chained off the fetch promise. You’d write the function differently if you were doing it manually, but  async functions have a couple of things they need to ensure:  ➤➤ That the promise they return is a native promise. Just returning the result of then would   mean the result could be a third-party promise—or possibly not even a promise, if the  object it’s calling then on is thenable but not a promise.  Though it could do that by using  Promise.resolve.   ➤➤ That any error thrown, even during the synchronous part of the code, is turned into a   rejection, not a synchronous exception.  Using new Promise, despite being an anti-pattern in most cases for manually written code when you  have a promise to chain from, addresses both of those requirements. Both of them could have been  solved in other ways, but this simple way is how the spec is written.  await Consumes Promises  The other thing you can see in the “translated” version of getTheData is that await consumes pro- mises. If the operand of await isn’t a native promise, the JavaScript engine creates a native promise  and uses the operand’s value to resolve it. Then, the JavaScript engine waits for that promise to settle  before proceeding with the following code in the function, as though it used then and passed in both  fulfillment and rejection handlers. Remember that resolving the promise doesn’t necessarily mean  fulfilling it; if the operand to await is a thenable, the native promise is resolved to that thenable and  will get rejected if the thenable gets rejected. If the value isn’t a thenable, the native promise is fulfilled  with the value. The await operator does that by effectively using Promise.resolve on the operand’s  value, everywhere await is used.  Not Promise.resolve literally, but the underlying operation it  does, creating a promise and resolving it to the value.   Standard Logic Is Asynchronous When await Is Used  In an async function, code that’s traditionally synchronous is asynchronous if there’s an await  involved. For instance, consider this asynchronous function:  async function fetchInSeries urls  {     const results = [];     for  const url of urls  {         const response = await fetch url ;   226  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors          if  !response.ok  {             throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;         }         results.push await response.json   ;     }     return results; }  To run this, use async-fetchInSeries.html, async-fetchInSeries.js, 1.json, 2.json, and  3.json in the downloads. You’ll need to serve them through a web server to run this with most  browsers, since doing ajax requests from pages loaded from file:   URLs is often disallowed.  If that were a non-async function  or it didn’t use await , those fetch calls would be in parallel  all  running at once , not in series  running one after another . But because this is an async function and  await is used within the for-of loop the loop runs asynchronously. The version of that using prom- ises directly might look something like this instead:  function fetchInSeries urls  {     let chain = Promise.resolve [] ;     for  const url of urls  {         chain = chain.then results => {             return fetch url                  .then response => {                     if  !response.ok  {                         throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;                     }                     return response.json  ;                 }                  .then result => {                     results.push result ;                     return results;                 } ;         } ;     }     return chain; }  To run this, use promise-fetchInSeries.html, promise-fetchInSeries.js, 1.json, 2.json,  and 3.json in the downloads. Again, you’ll need to serve them through a web server rather than just  opening the HTML locally.  Notice how the for-of loop just sets up the promise chain  as you saw in Chapter 8 , completing  before any of the asynchronous work is done. Also notice how much more complicated and difficult  to follow the code is.  This is a major part of the power of async functions: you write the logic in the old familiar way,  using await to handle waiting for asynchronous results rather than having to break up your logical  flow with callback functions.   async Functions  ❘  227  Rejections Are Exceptions, Exceptions Are Rejections;  Fulfillments Are Results, Returns Are Resolutions  Similarly to how for-of and while and other control-flow statements are adapted to han- dle asynchronous work inside async functions, try catch finally, throw, and return are all  adapted as well:  ➤➤ Rejections are exceptions. When you await a promise, and the promise rejects, that is   turned into an exception and can be caught by using try catch finally.  ➤➤ Exceptions are rejections. If you throw in an async function  and don’t catch it , that’s con-  verted into a rejection of the function’s promise.  ➤➤ returns are resolutions. If you return from an async function, that resolves its promise  with the value of the operand you provided return  either fulfilling it if you provide a non- thenable value, or resolving it to the thenable if you provide one .  You saw this in the getTheData example earlier, which used try finally to ensure that   spinner.stop was called when the operation completed. Let’s look more closely. Run the code in  Listing 9-1.  LISTING 9-1:  try catch in an async function—async-try-catch.js  function delayedFailure   {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         setTimeout    => {             reject new Error "failed"  ;         }, 800 ;     } ; } async function example   {     try {         await delayedFailure  ;         console.log "Done" ;     Execution doesn't get here      } catch  error  {         console.error "Caught:", error ;     } } example  ;  delayedFailure returns a promise that it later rejects, but when using await, an async function like  example sees that as an exception and lets you use try catch finally to handle it.   228  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors  ASYNC FUNCTION CALLS AT THE TOP LEVEL  Listing 9-1 calls an async function at the top level of the script. When doing that, it’s  essential that either you know the async function will never throw an error  that is,  the promise it returns will never be rejected , or that you add a catch handler to the  promise it returns. That’s true of Listing 9-1’s example because the entire function  body is in a try block with a catch attached to it  at least, it’s true unless for some  reason console.error throws an exception . In the general case where the async  function may well fail, ensure errors are handled:      example  .catch error => {            Handle report the error here     } ;  Let’s look at the other side of it: throw. Run the code in Listing 9-2.  LISTING 9-2:  throw in an async function—async-throw.js  function delay ms, value  {     return new Promise resolve => setTimeout resolve, ms, value  ; } async function delayedFailure   {     await delay 800 ;     throw new Error "failed" ; } function example   {     delayedFailure           .then    => {             console.log "Done" ;     Execution doesn't get here          }          .catch error => {             console.error "Caught:", error ;         } ; } example  ;  This version of delayedFailure is an async function that waits 800ms and then uses throw to  throw an exception. This non-async version of example uses the promise’s methods rather than  await, and sees that exception as a promise rejection, catching it via a rejection handler.  Although the code in Listings 9-1 and 9-2 uses new Error, that’s just convention  and arguably best  practice ; since JavaScript allows you to throw any value, and to use any value as a rejection reason,  you don’t have to use Error. See Listing 9-3, for instance, which uses strings instead. But as you  learned in Chapter 8, using Error instances has debugging advantages thanks to the call stack infor- mation they have.   async Functions  ❘  229  LISTING 9-3:  async function error examples—async-more-error-examples.js     `reject` using just a string function delayedFailure1   {     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {         setTimeout    => {             reject "failed 1" ;    Rejecting with a value that isn't an  Error instance         }, 800 ;     } ; } async function example1   {     try {         await delayedFailure1  ;         console.log "Done" ;     Execution doesn't get here      } catch  error  {         console.error "Caught:", error ;    Caught: "failed 1"     } } example1  ;      `throw` using just a string function delay ms, value  {     return new Promise resolve => setTimeout resolve, ms, value  ; } async function delayedFailure2   {     await delay 800 ;     throw "failed 2";    Throwing a value that isn't an Error instance } function example2   {     delayedFailure2           .then    => {             console.log "Done" ;     Execution doesn't get here          }          .catch error => {             console.error "Caught:", error ;    Caught: "failed 2"         } ; } example2  ;  Parallel Operations in async Functions  Using await in an async function suspends the function until the promise you’re awaiting settles.  But suppose you want to do a series of operations that can run in parallel in an async function?  This is one of the situations where you find yourself using promises  or at least promise methods   directly again, even in an async function. Suppose you have a fetchJSON function like this:  async function fetchJSON url  {     const response = await fetch url ;   230  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors      if  !response.ok  {         throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;     }     return response.json  ; }  Now suppose you have three resources you want to fetch, and it’s fine to do them in parallel. You  don’t want to do this:     Don't do this if you want them done in parallel const data = [     await fetchJSON "1.json" ,     await fetchJSON "2.json" ,     await fetchJSON "3.json"  ];  The reason is that they’ll be done in series  one after another , not in parallel. Remember that Java- Script engine evaluates the expressions making up the array’s contents before it creates the array and  assigns it to the data variable, so the function is suspended at await fetchJSON "1.json"  until  that promise settles, then at await fetchJSON "2.json" , etc.  Thinking back to Chapter 8, you’ll probably remember that there is something specifically designed  to handle parallel operations with promises: Promise.all. Even though you’re using an async func- tion, there’s no reason you can’t use it:  const data = await Promise.all [     fetchJSON "1.json" ,     fetchJSON "2.json" ,     fetchJSON "3.json"  ] ;  You await the promise from Promise.all, not the individual promises from the fetchJSON   calls. You let those promises populate the array you pass to Promise.all.  You can use Promise.race and the various others in the same way.  You Don’t Need return await  You may have noticed that the fetchJSON function in this section ends with  return response.json  ;  not  return await response.json  ;  There’s no need for await there. An async function uses the value you return to resolve the  promise the function created, so if the return value is a thenable, it’s already effectively awaited.  Writing return await is a bit like writing await await. You may see return await occasion- ally, and it seems to behave the same way, but it doesn’t, quite. If the operand is a thenable, not a  native promise, it adds an extra layer of promise resolution, which holds things up by one asyn- chronous cycle  or “tick” . That is, the version with await settles slightly later than it would have  without await. You can see it action by running the following  return-await-thenable.js in  the downloads :  function thenableResolve value  {     return {         then onFulfilled  {   async Functions  ❘  231                 A thenable may call its callback synchronously like this; a native                promise never will. This example uses a synchronous callback to                avoid giving the impression that the mechanism used to make it                asynchronous is the cause of the extra tick.             onFulfilled value ;         }     }; } async function a   {     return await thenableResolve "a" ; } async function b   {     return thenableResolve "b" ; } a  .then value => console.log value  ; b  .then value => console.log value  ;    b    a  Note how b’s callback runs before a’s, even though a was called first. a’s callback has to wait for one  extra asynchronous cycle because of the await.  This also used to be true if you awaited a native promise, but ES2020 includes a specification change  allowing return await nativePromise to be optimized to remove the extra asynchronous tick,  and that optimization is already finding its way into JavaScript engines. If you’re using Node.js v13  or later,2 or an up-to-date version of Chrome, Chromium, or Brave, they all have a version of V8 that  has the optimization. If you use Node.js v12 or earlier  with no flags  or Chrome v72 or earlier, they  use a version of V8 without the optimization. Run the following  return-await-native.js  on  something modern to see the optimization at work:  async function a   {     return await Promise.resolve "a" ; } async function b   {     return Promise.resolve "b" ; } a  .then value => console.log value  ; b  .then value => console.log value  ;  With an engine that has the optimization, you see a first, then b. In an engine without it, you see b  first, then a.  Bottom-line: you don’t need return await, just use return.  Pitfall: Using an async Function in an Unexpected Place  Suppose you’re doing a filter operation on an array:  filteredArray = theArray.filter  entry  => {        ... } ;  2 Node.js v11 and v12 also have it, behind a --harmony-await-optimization flag.   232  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors  and you want to use data from an asynchronous operation in the filter callback. Perhaps you  throw an await fetch entry.url  in:     Fails filteredArray = theArray.filter  entry  => {     const response = await fetch entry.url ;     const keep = response.ok ?  await response.json   .keep : false;     return keep; } ;  But you get an error complaining about the await keyword, because you’re trying to use it outside an  async function. The temptation is to slap an async on the filter callback:     WRONG filteredArray = theArray.filter async  entry  => {     const response = await fetch entry.url ;     const keep = response.ok ?  await response.json   .keep : false;     return keep; } ;  Now you don’t get errors . . . but your filteredArray still has all the values the original array had!  And it doesn’t wait for the fetch operations to finish. Why do you think that is?  Hint: what does an  async function return, and what is filter expecting?   Right! The problem is that an async function always returns a promise, and filter doesn’t expect a  promise, it expects a keep don’t keep flag. Promises are objects, and objects are truthy, so filter sees  each returned promise as a flag saying to keep the entry.  This comes up a lot when people first start using async await. It’s a powerful tool, but it’s important  to remember that when the function you’re writing is a callback, you need to consider how that call- back’s return value will be used. Only use an async function as a callback if what’s calling it  filter  in this example  expects to get a promise back from it.  There are a couple of places where it’s perfectly valid to use an async function as a callback to a  non–promise-specific API. One good example is using map on an array to build an array of promises  to pass to Promise.all or similar. But the majority of the time, if you find yourself writing an async  function as a callback to something that isn’t expressly promise-related, double-check that you’re not  falling into this pit.  ASYNC ITERATORS, ITERABLES, AND GENERATORS  In Chapter 6 you learned about iterators, iterables, and generators. As of ES2018, there are asynchro- nous versions of all of those. If you haven’t read Chapter 6 yet, you’ll want to do that before continu- ing with this section.  You’ll recall that an iterator is an object with a next method that returns a result object with done  and value properties. An asynchronous iterator is an iterator that returns a promise of a result object  rather than returning a result object directly.  You’ll also recall that an iterable is an object that has a Symbol.iterator method that returns an  iterator. Asynchronous iterables have an analogous method, Symbol.asyncIterator, that returns an  asynchronous iterator.   async Iterators, Iterables, and Generators  ❘  233  Finally, you’ll remember that a generator function provides syntax for creating generator objects,  which are objects that produce and consume values and have next, throw, and return methods.   An asynchronous generator function creates an asynchronous generator, which produces promises of  values rather than values themselves.  In the next two sections we’ll look at asynchronous iterators and asynchronous generators in  more detail.  Asynchronous Iterators  An asynchronous iterator is, again, simply an iterator whose next method provides a promise of a  result object rather than the result object itself. As with an iterator, you can write it manually  either  making next an async method or returning a promise manually , or use an asynchronous generator  function  since asynchronous generators are also asynchronous iterators . Or you could even write it  entirely manually using new Promise as necessary.  The vast majority of the time, you’re best off writing an async generator function when you want an  async iterator. As with iterators, though, it’s useful to understand the underlying mechanics. You’ll  learn about asynchronous generators in a later section; in this section, let’s implement an asynchro- nous iterator manually so you get a good look at the mechanics of it.  You may recall from Chapter 6 that all of the iterators you get from JavaScript itself inherit from a  prototype object the spec calls %IteratorPrototype%. %IteratorPrototype% provides a default  Symbol.iterator method that returns the iterator itself so that iterators are iterable, which is handy  for for-of statements and such. It also provides a place to add features to iterators. Asynchronous  iterators work the same way: any asynchronous iterator you get from JavaScript itself  as opposed to  third-party code  inherits from an object the spec calls %AsyncIteratorPrototype%. It provides a  default Symbol.asyncIterator method that returns the iterator itself, so that asynchronous iterators  are also asynchronous iterables, which will be useful when you learn about for-await-of later in  this chapter.  As with %IteratorPrototype%, there’s no publicly accessible global or property referring to  %AsyncIteratorPrototype%, and it’s a bit more awkward to get to than %IteratorPrototype%.  Here’s how:  const asyncIteratorPrototype =     Object.getPrototypeOf          Object.getPrototypeOf               async function *  {} .prototype                ;  Perhaps it’s just as well you won’t normally implement asynchronous iterators manually. If you want  the gory details behind that, see the “How to Get %AsyncIteratorPrototype%” inset.  Now that you know how to get the prototype for your asynchronous iterator, it’s time to create  it. Earlier in this chapter you saw a fetchInSeries function that fetched several URLs one after  another via fetch and provided an array with all of the results. Suppose you wanted a function to  fetch them individually and provide that result before moving on to the next. That’s a use case for an  asynchronous iterator; see Listing 9-4.   234  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors  HOW TO GET %AsyncIteratorPrototype%  Since there’s no publicly accessible global or property that directly refers to  %AsyncIteratorPrototype%, if you need to get it, you have to do so indirectly. The  concise code for doing that is shown in the main text. Here’s a version split into its  individual steps to make it simpler to understand:  let a =  async function *  {} .prototype;     Get the prototype this async generator                                               function would assign to instances let b = Object.getPrototypeOf a ;              Its prototype is %AsyncGeneratorPrototype% let asyncIteratorPrototype =         Object.getPrototypeOf b ;              Its prototype is %AsyncIteratorPrototype%  You create an asynchronous generator function  a function that, when called,  will create an asynchronous generator  using the async generator syntax   you’ll learn about in a later section. Then you get its prototype property  the   prototype it will assign to the generators it creates . Then you get its prototype,  which is the prototype of asynchronous generator objects  which the spec calls   %AsyncGeneratorPrototype% . Then you get its prototype, which is the proto- type for asynchronous iterators, %AsyncIteratorPrototype%.  Again, perhaps it’s good that you normally won’t want to create asynchronous itera- tors manually. Instead, just use an asynchronous generator function.  LISTING 9-4:  Using an async function to create an asynchronous iterator—async-iterator-  fetchInSeries.js  function fetchInSeries [...urls]  {     const asyncIteratorPrototype =         Object.getPrototypeOf              Object.getPrototypeOf                  async function*  {}              .prototype          ;     let index = 0;     return Object.assign          Object.create asyncIteratorPrototype ,         {             async next   {                 if  index >= urls.length  {                     return {done: true};                 }                 const url = urls[index++];                 const response = await fetch url ;   async Iterators, Iterables, and Generators  ❘  235                  if  !response.ok  {                     throw new Error "Error getting URL: " + url ;                 }                 return {value: await response.json  , done: false};             }         }      ; }  This implementation of fetchInSeries returns an asynchronous iterator, which is implemented as  an async function. Since it’s an async function, it returns a promise each time it’s called, which is  fulfilled via a return statement or rejected via a throw statement.  You may be wondering about the destructuring in the parameter list. Why  [...urls]  rather than  just  urls ? By using destructuring, the code makes a defensive copy of the array that was passed in  since, of course, the calling code could modify the original array. It’s nothing to do with asynchronous  iterators per se, just fairly standard practice for a function that works with a received array asyn- chronously.  Here’s one way you could use fetchInSeries by getting the iterator manually and calling next:     In an async function const it = fetchInSeries ["1.json", "2.json", "3.json"] ; let result; while  ! result = await it.next   .done  {     console.log result.value ; }  Notice that the code uses await it.next   to get the next result object, since next returns  a promise.  You can see that in action by taking the async-iterator-fetchInSeries.html, async-iterator- fetchInSeries.js, 1.json, 2.json, and 3.json files from the downloads and putting them in  a directory on your local web server, then opening them via HTTP. Again, just opening the HTML  directly from the file system won’t work, because of the ajax.  Again, in real code you’d probably just write an async generator function to make an asynchronous  iterator. If you do write one manually, beware that since next starts an asynchronous operation  and returns a promise for it, you can get the next call to next before the previous call’s operation  completes. The code in the example in this section is fine with that, but it wouldn’t be if it used this  version of next instead:     WRONG async next   {     if  index >= urls.length  {         return {done: true};     }     const url = urls[index];     const response = await fetch url ;   236  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors      ++index;     if  !response.ok  {         throw new Error "Error getting URL: " + url ;     }     return {value: await response.json  }; }  Because there’s an await between the index check against urls.length and the ++index that   increments it, two calls to next that overlap would both fetch the same URL  and the second would  be skipped —a difficult-to-diagnose bug.  Let’s look at how you write an asynchronous generator.  Asynchronous Generators  An asynchronous generator function is, unsurprisingly, a combination of an async function and a  generator function. You create one by using both the async keyword and the * indicating a genera- tor function. When called, it creates an asynchronous generator. Inside an asynchronous generator  function you can use await to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete, and yield to yield a  value  and consume a value, as with non-async generator functions .  See Listing 9-5 for the asynchronous generator version of fetchInSeries.  You can run it via  async-generator-fetchInSeries.html in the downloads.   LISTING 9-5:  Using an async generator function—async-generator-fetchInSeries.js  async function* fetchInSeries [...urls]  {     for  const url of urls  {         const response = await fetch url ;         if  !response.ok  {             throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;         }         yield response.json  ;     } }  That’s so much simpler than writing it manually! The basic logic is still the same, but instead of hav- ing to use a closure over the index variable, you can just use a for-of loop with await inside it to  loop through the URLs, and yield each result. Also, the generator automatically gets an appropriate  prototype: fetchInSeries.prototype, which inherits from %AsyncGeneratorPrototype%, which  inherits from %AsyncIteratorPrototype%.  The code to use it  manually for now, you’ll learn about a simpler way using for-await-of in the  next section  is the same as before:     In an async function const g = fetchInSeries ["1.json", "2.json", "3.json"] ; let result; while  ! result = await g.next   .done  {     console.log result.value ; }   async Iterators, Iterables, and Generators  ❘  237  Look again at this line in the code in the preceding asynchronous generator function:  yield response.json  ;  It directly yields a promise. You may see that line written like this instead:  yield await response.json  ;    Not best practice  and they both seem to do the same thing. Why is await optional there? Because in an asynchronous  generator function, yield automatically applies await to any operand you give it, so it’s not neces- sary there. It’s like return await in an async function: it just adds another layer of promise resolu- tion, potentially delaying it another “tick”  see “You Don’t Need return await” earlier in this chapter  for details .  So far, we’ve only used an asynchronous generator to produce values, but generators can consume  values as well: you can pass values into next that the generator will see as the result of the yield  operator. Since a non-async generator produces and consumes values, and an async generator wraps  the values you yield in promises automatically, you might wonder if it will automatically await a  promise if you pass one into next. No, it doesn’t. If you pass a promise into next, the async genera- tor code sees that promise as the result of the yield operator and has to await it explicitly  or use  then, etc. . Although this is asymmetrical with what happens when you yield a promise, it means you  have control over what you do with a promise if one is provided to your asynchronous generator  code. Perhaps you want to gather several up into an array and then await Promise.all on it. Not  automatically awaiting the value received from yield gives you that flexibility.  Let’s modify fetchInSeries so you can pass a flag into next saying you want to skip the next entry;  see Listing 9-6.  LISTING 9-6:  async generator consuming values—async-generator-fetchInSeries-with-skip.js  async function* fetchInSeries [...urls]  {     let skipNext = false;     for  const url of urls  {         if  skipNext  {             skipNext = false;         } else {             const response = await fetch url ;             if  !response.ok  {                 throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;             }             skipNext = yield response.json  ;         }     } }  To see this in action, copy the files async-generator-fetchInSeries-with-skip.html, async- generator-fetchInSeries-with-skip.js, 1.json, 2.json, and 3.json to your local web server  and open the HTML file from there  via HTTP .   238  ❘  CHAPTER 9    Asynchronous Functions, iterAtors, And GenerAtors  One final note about async generators: once the generator pauses and returns a promise from next,  the generator’s code doesn’t continue until that promise is settled, even if you call next again. The  second call to next returns a second promise as usual but doesn’t advance the generator. When the  first promise settles, then the generator advances and  eventually  settles the second promise. This is  true of calls to the generator’s return and throw methods as well.  for-await-of  So far you’ve only seen examples using an asynchronous iterator explicitly, getting the iterator object  and calling its next method:     In an async function const it = fetchInSeries ["1.json", "2.json", "3.json"] ; let result; while  ! result = await it.next   .done  {     console.log result.value ; }  But just as there’s a for-of loop for using a synchronous iterator more conveniently  Chapter 6 ,  there’s a for-await-of loop for using an asynchronous iterator more conveniently:  for await  const value of fetchInSeries ["1.json", "2.json", "3.json"]   {     console.log value ; }  for-await-of gets an iterator from what you pass it by calling its Symbol.asyncIterator method3  and then automatically awaits the result of calling next for you.  To see that in action, copy the files for-await-of.html, async-generator-fetchInSeries-with- skip.js, 1.json, 2.json, and 3.json to your local web server and open the HTML file from there   via HTTP .  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Here are some old habits you might consider updating to use the new toys you learned about in  this chapter.  Use async Functions and await Instead of Explicit Promises and  then catch  Old habit: Using explicit promise syntax:  function fetchJSON url  {     return fetch url          .then response => {  3  Remember that if you pass it an asynchronous iterator rather than an asynchronous iterable, that’s fine provided the   iterator has been created correctly  that is, has the Symbol.asyncIterator method that returns this .

In this chapter, you’ll learn about ES2015’s new template literals and template tag functions,  plus new string features such as improved Unicode support, iteration, and added methods.  TEMPLATE LITERALS  ES2015’s template literals provide a way to create strings  and other things  using a literal   syntax combining text and embedded substitutions. You’re familiar with other kinds of literals,   such as string literals delimited with quotes  "hi"  and regular expression literals delimited    242  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  with slashes   \s  . Template literals are delimited with backticks  ` , also called grave accents. This  character is in various places on various different language keyboard layouts; on English-language  keyboards it tends to be in the top left near Esc, but again, the location varies.  Template literals come in two varieties: untagged and tagged. We’ll look at untagged  standalone   template literals first, then tagged literals.  Basic Functionality  Untagged Template Literals   An untagged template literal creates a string. Here’s a simple example:  console.log `This is a template literal` ;  So far, that doesn’t seem to offer anything that a string literal doesn’t, but template literals have  several handy features. Within a template literal, you can use substitutions to fill in content from  any expression. A substitution starts with a dollar sign  $  immediately followed by an opening curly  brace  { , and ends with a closing curly brace  } ; everything between the curly braces is the body  of the substitution: a JavaScript expression. The expression is evaluated when the template literal is  evaluated. Its result is used in place of the substitution. Here’s an example:  const name = "Fred"; console.log `My name is ${name}` ;                     My name is Fred console.log `Say it loud! ${name.toUpperCase  }!` ;    Say it loud! FRED!  In an untagged template literal, if the expression’s result isn’t a string, it’s converted to one.  If you need to have an actual dollar sign followed by a curly brace in your text, escape the dollar sign:  console.log `Not a substitution: \${foo}` ;    Not a substitution: ${foo}  You don’t need to escape dollar signs unless they’re followed by an opening curly brace.  Another handy feature is that unlike string literals, template literals can contain unescaped newlines,  which are retained in the template. This code:  Note that any leading whitespace on the line following the newline is included in the   template. So this:  console.log `Line 1 Line 2` ;  outputs  Line 1 Line 2  for  const n of [1, 2, 3]  {     console.log `Line ${n}-1     Line ${n}-2` ; }  outputs  Line 1-1     Line 1-2   Template Literals  ❘  243  Line 2-1     Line 2-2 Line 3-1     Line 3-2  Since the content of the substitution is any JavaScript expression, you can have newlines and indenta- tion if your substitution body is complex. That's just whitespace in the expression, so it isn’t included  in the string:  const a = ["one", "two", "three"]; console.log `Complex: ${     a.reverse        .join        .toUpperCase   }` ;                       "Complex: THREE,TWO,ONE"  The expression in the substitution body isn’t limited in any way; it’s a full expression. Among other  things, that means you can put a template literal within a template literal, though it can quickly  become difficult to read and maintain:  const a = ["text", "from", "users"]; const lbl = "Label from user"; show ` ${escapeHTML `${lbl}: ${a.join  }` } ` ;  That works just fine. But as a matter of style, it’s probably better to move that inner template literal  out of the outer one for simplicity:  const a = ["text", "from", "users"]; const lbl = "Label from user"; const userContent = `${lbl}: ${a.join  }`; show ` ${escapeHTML userContent } ` ;  Within a template literal, all the standard escape sequences work just like they do in string literals: \n  creates a newline, \u2122 is the ™ character, and so on. That means that to put an actual backslash  in the template, you need to escape it just like in a string literal: \\.  Template Tag Functions  Tagged Template Literals   In addition to their untagged use to create strings, template literals combined with tag functions are  useful for other purposes.  A tag function is a function designed to be called using tagged function call syntax, which doesn’t use  parentheses      like normal calls do; instead, you write the function name followed by a template  literal  optionally with whitespace in between :  example`This is the template to pass to the function`;    or example `This is the template to pass to the function`;  This calls the example function. It’s a new style of function call for JavaScript  as of ES2015 . When  called this way, the example function receives the template from the template literal  an array of  the literal’s hardcoded text segments  as its first argument followed by discrete arguments for the  values resulting from evaluating the substitution expressions. For an example, run the code from  Listing 10-1.   244  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  LISTING 10-1:  Basic tag function example—tag-function-example.js  function example template, value0, value1, value2  {     console.log template ;     console.log value0, value1, value2 ; } const a = 1, b = 2, c = 3; example`Testing ${a} ${b} ${c}.`;  That code outputs the following:  ["testing ", " ", " ", "."] 1 2 3  Note that the template array contains the initial word "testing " including the trailing space, the  whitespace between the three substitutions, and the text after the last substitution at the end of the  template  the period . The arguments following that have the substitution values  value0 contains the  result of ${a}, value1 contains the result of ${b}, and so on .  Unless your function expects a fixed number of substitutions, it’s common to use a rest parameter for  the values of the substitutions, like this:  function example template, ...values  {     console.log template ;     console.log values ; } const a = 1, b = 2, c = 3; example`Testing ${a} ${b} ${c}.`;  ["testing ", " ", " ", "."] [1, 2, 3]  That outputs much the same thing as before, except the values are in an array  values  now:  The evaluated substitution values are not converted to strings; your tag function gets the actual value.  That value may be a primitive like the numbers in the values array in the preceding example, or an  object reference, or a function reference—any value at all. Listing 10-2 has an example just to empha- size that point, since for most of the rest of this section, it happens that we’ll be using substitutions  that result in strings.  LISTING 10-2:  Tag function getting non-string value—non-string-value-example.js  const logJSON =  template, ...values  => {     let result = template[0];     for  let index = 1; index < template.length; ++index  {         result += JSON.stringify values[index - 1]  + template[index];     }     console.log result ; };   const a = [1, 2, 3]; const o = {"answer": 42}; const s = "foo"; logJSON`Logging: a = ${a} and o = ${o} and s = ${s}`;   Template Literals  ❘  245  Running this shows:  Logging: a = [1,2,3] and o = {"answer":42} and s = "foo"  As you can see, logJSON received the array and object, not versions of them converted to string.  Array.prototype.reduce is handy for when you’re interspersing entries from the template and  the values array, as logJSON does. template is guaranteed to have at least one entry,1 and to be one  entry longer than values, so reduce without a seed works well for zipping them together. See List- ing 10-3 for a version of logJSON using reduce instead of a loop.  LISTING 10-3:  Tag function getting non-string value  reduce —non-string-value-  example-reduce.js  const logJSON =  template, ...values  => {     const result = template.reduce  acc, str, index  =>         acc + JSON.stringify values[index - 1]  + str      ;     console.log result ; };   const a = [1, 2, 3]; const o = {"answer": 42}; const s = "foo"; logJSON`Logging: a = ${a} and o = ${o} and s = ${s}`;  This idiom works well for tag functions. For instance, if you wanted to emulate the string creation  behavior of untagged template literals, you could do it like this:  function emulateUntagged template, ...values  {     return template.reduce  acc, str, index  => acc + values[index - 1] + str ; } const a = 1, b = 2, c = 3; console.log emulateUntagged`Testing ${a} ${b} ${c}.` ;   You probably wouldn’t use reduce to do exactly what it’s doing there, though; later you’ll learn  about a simpler option for this specific example. But reduce is useful if you may be performing some  operation on the values in the process of building the result.   Creating strings from templates is a very powerful use case, but there are plenty of non-string use  cases as well. Tag functions and template literals allow you to create nearly any domain-specific lan- guage  DSL  you may need.  Regular expressions make a good example.  It’s awkward to use the RegExp constructor because it accepts a string, and so any backslashes meant  for the regular expression have to be escaped  and any backslashes meant to be used literally have to  be double-escaped: once for the string literal, and once for regex; four backslashes in total . This is  one of the reasons we have regular expression literals in JavaScript.  1  You may remember that calling reduce on an empty array raises an error if you don’t provide a seed value, but since  template is guaranteed never to be empty, we don’t have that problem with logJSON  provided it’s called as a tag  function .   246  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  But if you want to use a variable’s value in a regular expression, you have to use the regular   expression constructor and fight with the backslashes and the lack of clarity; you can’t use a literal.  Tag functions to the rescue!  “But wait,” you ask, “aren’t the strings in the template parameter . . . just strings? Haven’t the  escape sequences created by the backslashes, if any, already been processed?”  Good point! They have, yes; which is why the template array has an extra property called raw.   This takes advantage of the fact that arrays are objects, so they can have properties that aren’t array  entries.  The raw property contains an array of the raw text of the text segments of the template. Run  the code from Listing 10-4.  Listing 10-4:  Tag function showing raw string segments—tag-function-raw-strings.js  function example template  {     const first = template.raw[0];     console.log first ;     console.log first.length ;     console.log first[0] ; } example`\u000A\x0a\n`;  \u000A\x0a\n 12 \  This code takes the raw version of the first text segment you pass in  the only one, in the example   and outputs it, its length, and just its first character. It outputs the following:  Notice that the backslashes are actually backslashes; the escape sequences have not been interpreted.  Also note that they haven’t been turned into some canonical form; they are as written in the template  literal. You know that because \u000A, \x0a, and \n all encode the exact same character  U+000A, a  newline . But the raw version is just that: raw. It’s the raw content of that text segment in the template   literal.  Using that raw array, you can build a tag function to create a regular expression where the text of the  template literal is used, er, literally:  const createRegex =  template, ...values  => {        Build the source from the raw text segments and values         in a later section, you'll see something that can replace         this reduce call      const source = template.raw.reduce           acc, str, index  => acc + values[index - 1] + str      ;        Check it's in  expr flags form     const match =  ^\  .+ \  [a-z]* $ .exec source ;     if  !match  {         throw new Error "Invalid regular expression" ;     }        Get the expression and flags, create     const [, expr, flags = ""] = match;     return new RegExp expr, flags ; };   Template Literals  ❘  247  INVALID ESCAPE SEQUENCES IN TEMPLATE LITERALS  In ES2015 through ES2017, the escape sequences in template literals were restricted  to valid JavaScript escape sequences. So for instance, \ufoo would cause a syntax  error, because a Unicode escape sequence must have digits, not foo, after the \u.  That was limiting for DSLs, though, so ES2018 lifted that restriction. If a text  segment contains an invalid escape sequence, its entry in the template has the value  undefined, and the raw text is in template.raw:      const show =  template  => {         console.log "template:" ;         console.log template ;         console.log "template.raw:" ;         console.log template.raw ;     };     show`Has invalid escape: \ufoo${","}Has only valid escapes: \n`;  This outputs      template:     [undefined, "Has only valid escapes: \n"]     template.raw:     ["Has invalid escape: \\ufoo", "Has only valid escapes: \\n"]  With that tag function, you can write regular expressions with embedded variables without having to  double-escape things:  const alternatives = ["this", "that", "the other"]; const rex = createRegex` \b ?:${alternatives.map escapeRegExp .join "" } \b i`;  This code assumes an escapeRegExp function that isn’t part of the standard JavaScript library,  but is in many a programmer’s toolkit. Run Listing 10-5 for a complete example  including the   escapeRegExp function .  LISTING 10-5:  createRegex complete example—createRegex-example.js  const createRegex =  template, ...values  => {        Build the source from the raw text segments and values         in a later section, you'll see something that can replace        this reduce call      const source = template.raw.reduce           acc, str, index  => acc + values[index - 1] + str      ;        Check it's in  expr flags form     const match =  ^\  .+ \  [a-z]* $ .exec source ;     if  !match  {         throw new Error "Invalid regular expression" ;     }        Get the expression and flags, create     const [, expr, flags = ""] = match;     return new RegExp expr, flags ;   248  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  };    From the TC39 proposal: https:  github.com benjamingr RegExp.escape const escapeRegExp = s => String s .replace  [\\^$*+?.  [\]{}] g, "\\$&" ;   const alternatives = ["this", "that", "the other"]; const rex = createRegex` \b ?:${alternatives.map escapeRegExp .join "" } \b i`;   const test =  str, expect  => {     const result = rex.test str ;     console.log str + ":", result, "=>", !result == !expect ? "Good" : "ERROR" ; }; test "doesn't have either", false ; test "has_this_but_not_delimited", false ; test "has this ", true ; test "has the other ", true ;  Regular expressions are just one example of a DSL, though. You might create a tag function to use  human-like logic expressions to query a JavaScript object tree, using substitutions for both the values  and the tree  or trees  to search:     Hypothetical example const data = [     {type: "widget", price: 40.0},     {type: "gadget", price: 30.0},     {type: "thingy", price: 10.0},        ... ];     ...called in response to user input... function searchClick event  {     const types = getSelectedTypes  ;              Perhaps `["widget", "gadget"]`     const priceLimit = getSelectedPriceLimit  ;    Perhaps `35`     const results = search`${data} for type in ${types} and price < ${priceLimit}`;     for  const result of results  {            ...show result...     } }  String.raw  When used as a tag function, String.raw returns a string with the raw text segments from the   template combined with any evaluated substitution values. For example:  const answer = 42; console.log String.raw`Answer:\t${answer}` ;    Answer:\t42  Notice that the escape sequence \t has not been interpreted; the resulting string literally has a   backslash followed by the letter t. What could this possibly be useful for?  It’s useful any time you want to create a string without having escape sequences in the string inter- preted. For instance:  ➤➤ Specifying a hardcoded path in a utility script on a Windows computer:   fs.open String.raw`C:\nifty\stuff.json`    Template Literals  ❘  249  ➤➤ Creating a regular expression containing backslashes and a variable portion  an alternative   to the createRegex function you saw earlier :   new RegExp String.raw`^\d+${separator}\d+$`   ➤➤ Outputting LaTeX or PDF sequences  which can also contain backslashes   Basically, String.raw is useful any time you want the raw string you typed  possibly with substitu- tions , not an interpreted string.  It’s also really useful when used by other tag functions. For example, in the createRegex tag function  earlier, to create the raw source of our DSL  in our case, a regular expression , we needed to put back  together the raw array of text segments and the values passed to the tag function via substitutions,  like this:      const source = template.raw.reduce           acc, str, index  => acc + values[index - 1] + str      ;  For a certain class of tag functions  ones gathering the template and values—perhaps pre-processed  values—into a string , this is a common requirement, and it’s exactly what String.raw does. So we  can call it to do that part for us, replacing the reduce call. Since we’re calling it without a template  literal, we use normal    notation, not tag notation, for the call:  const source = String.raw template, ...values ;  That makes the createRegex function simpler:  const createRegex =  template, ...values  => {        Build the source from the raw text segments and values     const source = String.raw template, ...values ;        Check it's in  expr flags form     const match =  ^\  .+ \  [a-z]* $ .exec source ;     if  !match  {         throw new Error "Invalid regular expression" ;     }        Get the expression and flags, create     const [, expr, flags = ""] = match;     return new RegExp expr, flags ; };  Run the simpler-createRegex.js file from the downloads to see this in action.  Reusing Template Literals  One often-asked question about template literals is: how do you reuse them? After all, the result  of an untagged template literal isn’t a template object, it’s a string. What if you want a template  you’re going to reuse? For instance, suppose you often want to output a first name, last name, and  then a nickname or “handle” in parentheses. You might use a template literal like `${firstName}  ${lastName}  ${handle} ` , but that’s immediately evaluated and turned into a string. How do  you reuse it?  This is a classic case of overthinking something, but it comes up again and again.   250  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  As is often the case when the question is “How do I reuse this?” the answer is to wrap it in  a function:  const formatUser =  firstName, lastName, handle  =>     `${firstName} ${lastName}  ${handle} `; console.log formatUser "Joe", "Bloggs", "@joebloggs"  ;  Template Literals and Automatic Semicolon Insertion  If you prefer to write your code without semicolons  relying on Automatic Semicolon Insertion ,  you’re probably used to avoiding starting a line with an opening parenthesis or square bracket    or  [ , because it can get combined with the end of the previous line. This can cause behavior you didn’t  intend, such as an errant function call or a property accessor expression that was meant to be the  beginning of an array, that sort of thing.  Template literals add a new “ASI hazard:” if you start a line with a backtick to start a template literal,  it can be seen as a tag call to a function referenced at the end of the previous line  just like an opening  parenthesis .  So if you rely on ASI, add the backtick to your list of characters you put a semicolon in front of at the  beginning of a line, just like   or [.  IMPROVED UNICODE SUPPORT  ES2015 markedly improved JavaScript’s Unicode support, adding several features to strings and   regular expressions to make working with the full Unicode character set simpler. This section covers  the string improvements. The regular expression improvements are covered in Chapter 15.  First, a bit of terminology and review before we get to the new features.  Unicode, and What Is a JavaScript String?  If you already have a solid understanding of Unicode and Unicode transformation formats  UTFs ,  code points, code units, etc., then: a JavaScript string is a series of UTF-16 code units that tolerates  invalid surrogate pairs. If you’re one of the few people who comfortably understood that sentence,  you can skip to the next section. If you’re in the vast majority who didn’t  because let’s face it, those  are some pretty arcane terms! , read on.  Human language is complicated; human language writing systems doubly so. English is one of the  simplest: hand-waving away some details, each native English grapheme  “a minimally distinctive  unit of writing in the context of a particular writing system”2  is one of 26 letters or 10 digits. But  many languages don’t work that way. Some, like French, have a base alphabet and a small number  of diacritical marks used to modify some of those letters  such as the grave accent on the “a” in  “voilà” ; that “à” is perceived by native readers as a single grapheme, even though it’s made up of  parts. Devanagari, a writing system used in India and Nepal, uses a base alphabet for syllables with a  given consonant and a default vowel sound  the “a” in “about” . For example, “na” is the “letter”  .  For syllables with other vowel sounds  or no vowel sound , Devanagari uses diacriticals. To write “ni”   2 https:  unicode.org faq char_combmark.html   Improved Unicode Support  ❘  251  instead of “na,” the base letter for “na”   “ni”    . “ ” is perceived as a single grapheme by native readers, even though  again  it’s made up  of parts. Chinese uses several thousand distinct graphemes, and  again waving away details  words  are typically made up of one to three of them. So it’s complicated even before we throw computers  into the mix.    is modified by a diacritical for the “i” sound     , creating   To handle all this complexity, Unicode defines code points, values in the range 0x000000  0  to  0x10FFFF  1,114,111  with specific meanings and properties, typically written with “U+” followed  by four to six hexadecimal digits. Code points are not “characters,” although that’s a common misun- derstanding. A code point may be a “character” on its own  like the English letter “a” , or it may be a  “base character”  like “ ”, the “na” syllable in Devanagari , or a “combining character”  such as the  diacritical “ ” that turns “na” to “ni” , or a few other things. Unicode also has several code points  for things that aren’t graphemes at all, such as a zero-width space, and also for things that aren’t parts  of words at all, like emojis.  Unicode originally used the range 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, which fit in 16 bits  this was called “UCS- 2”—2-byte Universal Character Set . A code point could be held in a single 16-bit value. Modern  at  the time  systems used 16-bit “characters” to store strings. When Unicode had to be extended beyond  16 bits  0x000000 to 0x10FFFF requires 21 bits , it meant that not all code points would fit within  16-bit values anymore. To support those 16-bit systems, the concept of surrogate pairs was created:  a value in the range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF is a “leading”  or “high”  surrogate and is expected to be fol- lowed by a value in the range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF, a “trailing”  or “low”  surrogate. The pair, taken  together, can be converted to a single code point using a fairly simple calculation. The 16-bit values  are called code units to distinguish them from code points. This “transformation” of the 21-bit code  point values to 16-bit code unit values is called UTF-16. In well-formed UTF-16, you never have a  leading surrogate that isn’t followed by a trailing surrogate or vice versa.  JavaScript is one of those modern-at-the-time systems. A JavaScript “string” is a series of UTF-16  code units, with the exception that JavaScript strings tolerate invalid surrogates  a leading surrogate  without a trailing one or the other way around  and define semantics for them: if half of a surrogate  pair is encountered without the other half, it must be treated as though it were a code point rather  than a code unit. So for instance, if 0xD820 were found in isolation, it would be treated as code point  U+D820, rather than a leading surrogate.  U+D820 is reserved and so has no assigned meaning, so  the “unknown character” glyph would be rendered if the string were output.   All of this means that a single grapheme from a human point of view may be one or more code  points, and that a single code point may be one or two UTF-16 code units  JavaScript string “charac- ters” . See the examples in Table 10-1.  TABLE 10-1:  Code Points and Code Units Examples  “CHARACTER”  English “a”  Devanagari “  ”  Smiley Face Emoji       CODE POINT S   UTF-16 CODE UNIT S   U+0061  U+0928 U+093F  U+1F60A  0061  0928 093F  D83D DE0A   252  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  Although the English grapheme “a” is a single code point, and a single UTF-16 code unit, the Devana- gari “ni” grapheme “ ” requires two code points, each of which  it happens  fits in in a single UTF- 16 code unit. The Smiley Face emoji is a single code point, but requires two UTF-16 code units, and  thus two JavaScript “characters”:  console.log "a".length ;           1 console.log " ".length ;        2 console.log "☺".length ;                    2  UTF-16 is the relevant one for JavaScript, but it’s worth noting that there are also UTF-8 and UTF- 32. UTF-8 encodes code points into one to four 8-bit code units  with the ability to be extended to  five or six code units if Unicode has to grow further . UTF-32 is just a one-for-one mapping of code  points to code units using  you guessed it!  32-bit code units.  Whew! What a lot of context. Now that we have it, let’s see what’s new.  Code Point Escape Sequence  In a JavaScript string literal, it used to be that if you wanted to use an escape sequence to write a code  point that required two UTF-16 code units, you had to figure out the UTF-16 values and write them  separately, like this:  console.log "\uD83D\uDE0A" ;       smiling face emoji   ES2015 added Unicode code point escape sequences, which let you specify the actual code point value  instead—no more fiddly UTF-16 calculations. You write it in curly braces in hex  in general, Unicode  values are listed in hex . The smiling face with smiling eyes we’ve been using is U+1F60A, so:  console.log "\u{1F60A}" ;       smiling face emoji   String.fromCodePoint  ES2015 also added the code point equivalent of String.fromCharCode  which works in code units :  String.fromCodePoint. You can pass it one or more code points as numbers, and it provides the  equivalent string:  console.log String.fromCodePoint 0x1F60A  ;       smiling face emoji   String.prototype.codePointAt  Continuing the theme of code point support, you can get the code point at a given position in the  string via String.prototype.codePointAt:  console.log " ".codePointAt 0 .toString 16 .toUpperCase   ;    1F60A  This one’s a bit tricky, though: the index you pass it is in code units  JavaScript “characters” , not  code points. So s.codePointAt 1  doesn’t return the second code point in the string, it returns the  code point that starts at index 1 of the string. If the first code point in the string requires two code  units, s.codePointAt 1  will return the value of that code point’s trailing surrogate code unit:  const charToHex =  str, i  =>     "0x" + str.codePointAt i .toString 16 .toUpperCase  .padStart 6, "0" ;     Improved Unicode Support  ❘  253  ";    Two identical smiling face emojis  const str = " for  let i = 0; i < str.length; ++i  {     console.log charToHex str, i  ; }  This outputs four values  0x01F60A, 0x00DE0A, 0x01F60A, 0x00DE0A  because each smiley face  takes up two “characters” in the string, but the code only advances the counter by one on each itera- tion. The value that shows up in the second and fourth positions, 0x00DE0A, is the trailing surrogate  of the pair that defines the smiley face. The code should probably skip those trailing surrogates and  just list  or find  the actual code points in the string.  If you’re looping from the beginning, the solution is simple: use for-of instead of a for loop. See the  “Iteration” section later in this chapter for details.  If you’re landing in the middle of a string and want to find the beginning of the nearest code point,  that’s not too hard either: get the “code point” where you are and check whether it’s in the range  0xDC00 to 0xDFFF  inclusive . If so, that’s the trailing surrogate of  presumably  a pair, so step back  one to get to the beginning of the pair  repeating if necessary to allow for invalid surrogate pairs , or  step forward to get to the beginning of the next code point  repeating as necessary . You might also  check for isolated leading surrogates, the range 0xD800 through 0xDBFF. Those two ranges are next  to each other, so you can use 0xD800 through 0xDFFF for a check that includes either a standalone  leading or trailing surrogate.  String.prototype.normalize  Rounding out the improved support for Unicode, the normalize method of strings creates a new  “normalized” string using one of the normalization forms defined by the Unicode consortium.  In Unicode, the same string can be written in more than one way. Normalization is the process of  creating a new string written in a “normal” form  four of which are defined . This can be important  for comparisons, or advanced processing, etc. Let’s look at it more closely.  In French, the letter “c” is “hard”  pronounced like an English “k”  if it’s followed by the letter “a”.  In words where it’s followed by an “a” but should be “soft”  pronounced like the letter “s” , it gets  a diacritical mark called a cédille added under it. You can see this in the very name of the language:  Français. It’s pronounced “fransays,” not “frankays,” because of the cédille on the “c”. When a “c”  has that mark, it’s creatively called a c cédille.  For mostly historic reasons, c cédille  “ç”  has its own code point: U+00E7.3 But it can also be written  as a combination of the letter “c”  U+0063  and a combining mark for the cédille  U+0327 :  console.log "Français" ;          Français  console.log "Franc\u0327ais" ;    Français  Depending on the font, they may look slightly different, but they’re the same word—except a naïve  comparison doesn’t reflect that:  const f1 = "Français"; const f2 = "Franc\u0327ais"; console.log f1 === f2 ;         false  3  Computer history, that is. French was one of the earliest languages supported by computers, and having separate char-  acters in the character set for letters with diacriticals was the simple way to support it.   254  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  Normalization fixes it:  console.log f1.normalize   === f2.normalize   ;    true  This is just one way a string may vary but still encode the same text. Some languages can apply  several diacritical marks to the same “letter.” If the order of the marks is different in one string vs.  another, the strings won’t be equal in a naïve check, but will be equal in a normalized form.  Unicode has two primary types of normalization: Canonical and Compatibility. Within each, it has  two forms: Decomposed and Composed. Without going into too much detail, here’s what the Unicode  standard has to say about the two types of normalization:  Canonical equivalence is a fundamental equivalency between characters or  sequences of characters which represent the same abstract character, and which  when correctly displayed should always have the same visual appearance and  behavior . . .  Compatibility equivalence is a weaker type of equivalence between characters or  sequences of characters which represent the same abstract character  or sequence of  abstract characters , but which may have distinct visual appearances or behaviors.  The visual appearances of the compatibility equivalent forms typically constitute  a subset of the expected range of visual appearances of the character  or sequence  of characters  they are equivalent to. However, these variant forms may represent a  visual distinction that is significant in some textual contexts, but not in others. As a  result, greater care is required to determine when use of a compatibility equivalent  is appropriate. If the visual distinction is stylistic, then markup or styling could  be used to represent the formatting information. However, some characters with  compatibility decompositions are used in mathematical notation to represent a  distinction of a semantic nature; replacing the use of distinct character codes by  formatting in such contexts may cause problems . . .  Unicode Standard Annex 15: Unicode Normalization Forms  The standard provides a good example of when the “compatibility” type can cause problems: the string  “i9”. In mathematics, that’s “i to the 9th power.” But if you normalize that string using compatibil- ity normalization, you get the string “i9”; the superscript “9”  U+2079  was turned into just the digit  “9”  U+0039 . In a mathematical context, those two strings mean very different things. The canonical   rather than compatibiity  type of normalization preserves the superscript nature of the code point.  normalize accepts an optional argument allowing you to control which form is used:  ➤➤ "NFD"  Normalization Form D : Canonical Decomposition. In this form, the string is   decomposed in a canonical way into its most discrete pieces. For instance, with “Français”  using the c cédille code point, NFD would separate the c cédille into the separate “c” code  point and the combining cédille code point. In a string with multiple combining code points  affecting a single base, they’d be put in a canonical order.   Iteration  ❘  255  ➤➤ "NFC"  Normalization Form C : Canonical Composition. In this form  which is the   default , the string is first decomposed in a canonical way  NFD , and then recomposed in a  canonical way, using single code points where appropriate. For instance, this form combines  a “c” followed by the combining cédille into the single “c cédille” code point.  ➤➤ "NFKD"  Normalization Form KD : Compatibility Decomposition. In this form, the string  is decomposed into its most discrete pieces using the “compatibility” type of normalization   the one that changed the superscript “9” into a plain “9” .  ➤➤ "NFKC"  Normalization Form KC : Compatibility Composition. In this form, the string is   decomposed with the compatibility type of normalization, then recomposed with canonical  composition.  The default if you don’t provide one is "NFC".  Depending on your use case, you might choose any of the four forms, but for many use cases, the  default canonical composed form is likely to be your best choice. It maintains the full information of  the string, while using canonical code points for combined forms that have them, like c cédille.  That’s it for the Unicode changes. Let’s look at other ways strings have improved . . .  You learned about iterables and iterators in Chapter 6. In ES2015 onward, strings are iterable. The  iteration visits each code point  rather than each code unit  in the string. Run Listing 10-6.  LISTING 10-6:  Simple string iteration example—simple-string-iteration-example.js  for  const ch of "> <"  {     console.log `${ch}  ${ch.length} ` ; }  ITERATION  The output is:  >     1   2  <     1   Remember that the smiley is a single code point, but requires two UTF-16 code units  JavaScript   “characters” . So since length represents the length in code units, the second iteration out- puts “   2 ”.  One by-product of this is that, depending on your use case, you may decide to change how   you normally convert a string to an array of characters. The idiomatic way before ES2015 was   str.split "" , which will split the string into an array of code units. As of ES2015, you might  choose to use Array.from str  instead, which results in an array of code points  not code units .  You’ll learn about Array.from in Chapter 11, but briefly, it creates an array by looping through the    256  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  iterable you pass it and adding each iterated value to the array. So using Array.from on a string splits  it into an array of code points via the string iterator:  const charToHex = ch =>     "0x" + ch.codePointAt 0 .toString 16 .toUpperCase  .padStart 6, "0" ; const show = array => {     console.log array.map charToHex  ; };   const str = "> <"; show str.split ""  ;      ["0x00003E", "0x00D83D", "0x00DE0A", "0x00003C"] show Array.from str  ;    ["0x00003E", "0x01F60A", "0x00003C"]  That said, while Array.from str  may be better  for some definitions of “better”  than   str.split ""  depending on your use case, it will still break up code points that combine to form  a single human-perceived grapheme. Remember that Devanagari syllable “ni”   requires two code points  a base and a diacritical mark  but is perceived as a single grapheme? Even  splitting into code points will separate those. The Devanagari word for Devanagari,  , has five  perceived graphemes      , but even the Array.from approach results in an array of eight  code points. A more sophisticated algorithm could use the Unicode information about which code  points “extend” a grapheme  which is available in the Unicode database , but string iteration doesn’t  attempt that level of sophistication.   ? The one that            NEW STRING METHODS  ES2015 added a few handy utility methods to strings.  String.prototype.repeat  No prize for guessing what this does from the name!  That’s right, repeat simply repeats the string you call it on a given number of times:  console.log "n".repeat 3  ;    nnn  If you pass it 0 or NaN, you’ll get back an empty string. If you pass it a value less than 0, or Infinity   positive or negative , you’ll get an error.  String.prototype.startsWith, endsWith  startsWith and endsWith provide a simple way of checking whether a string starts with or ends  with a substring  with an optional starting or ending index :  console.log "testing".startsWith "test"  ;    true console.log "testing".endsWith "ing"  ;       true console.log "testing".endsWith "foo"  ;       false  Both startsWith and endsWith return true if you pass in a blank substring    "foo".startsWith ""  .   New String Methods  ❘  257  If you pass startsWith a starting index, it treats the string as though it started at that index:  console.log "now testing".startsWith "test"  ;       false console.log "now testing".startsWith "test", 4  ;    true    Index 4 ------^  If the index is equal to or greater than the length of the string, the result of the call will be false  if  you pass in a non-blank substring  since there’s nothing in the string at that point that could match.  If you pass endsWith an ending index, it treats the string as though it ended at that index:  console.log "now testing".endsWith "test"  ;       false console.log "now testing".endsWith "test", 8  ;    true    Index 8 ----------^  In that example, using the index 8 makes endsWith act as though the string were just "now test"  instead of being "now testing".  Passing in 0 means the result will be false  if you pass in a non-blank substring , since effectively the  string you’re looking in is blank.  The checks startsWith and endsWith do are always case-sensitive.  In ES2015–ES2020  so far , startsWith and endsWith are required to throw an error if you pass  them a regular expression rather than a string. That’s to prevent implementations from providing  their own additional behavior for regular expressions, so that later editions of the JavaScript specifi- cation can define the behavior.  String.prototype.includes  This is another one where the name pretty much tells you what you need to know. includes checks  the string you call it on to see whether it includes the substring you pass in, optionally starting at a  given location in the string:  console.log "testing".includes "test"  ;        true console.log "testing".includes "test", 1  ;     false  The second call in this example returns false because it starts checking at index 1 of the string, and  so skips the leading letter “t”, as though you were just checking "esting" rather than "testing".  If you pass in a blank substring to look for, the result will be true.  Like startsWith and endsWith, you’ll get errors if you pass in a negative or infinite index, or if you  pass in a regular expression rather than a string  so that future editions of the specification can define  behavior for that .  String.prototype.padStart, padEnd  ES2017 added string padding to the standard library via padStart and padEnd:  const s = "example"; console.log `${s.padStart 10 }` ;    => "   example" console.log `${s.padEnd 10 }` ;    => "example   "   258  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  You specify the total length of the string you want and, optionally, the string to use for padding  the  default is a space . padStart returns a new string with any necessary padding at the start of the  string so that the result is of the length you specified; padEnd pads the end instead.  Note that you specify the total length of the resulting string, not just the amount of padding you  want. In the preceding example, since "example" has seven characters and the length used in the code  earlier is 10, three spaces of padding get added.  The pad string can be more than one character long. It’s repeated and or truncated as necessary:  This example uses dashes instead:  const s = "example"; console.log `${s.padStart 10, "-" }` ;    => "---example" console.log `${s.padEnd 10, "-" }` ;    => "example---"  const s = "example"; console.log `${s.padStart 10, "-*" }` ;    => "-*-example" console.log `${s.padEnd 10, "-*" }` ;    => "example-*-" console.log `${s.padStart 14, "...oooOOO" }` ;    => "...oooOexample"  You may be used to seeing “left” and “right” in this context, rather than “start” and “end.” TC39  decided to use “start” and “end” to avoid confusion when strings are used in a right-to-left  RTL   language context, such as modern Hebrew and Arabic.  String.prototype.trimStart, trimEnd  ES2019 added trimStart and trimEnd to strings. trimStart trims whitespace from the start of the  string, trimEnd from the end:  const s = "    testing    "; const startTrimmed = s.trimStart  ; const endTrimmed = s.trimEnd  ; console.log `${startTrimmed}` ;    => testing     console.log `${endTrimmed}` ;    =>     testing  The history behind this addition is somewhat interesting: when ES2015 added trim to strings, most  JavaScript engines  eventually all major ones  also added trimLeft and trimRight although they  weren’t in the specification. When standardizing that, TC39 made the decision to use the names  trimStart and trimEnd rather than trimLeft and trimRight in order to be consistent with  ES2017’s padStart and padEnd. However, trimLeft and trimRight are listed as aliases for   trimStart and trimEnd in Annex B  Additional ECMAScript Features for Web Browsers .   Updates to the match, split, search, and replace Methods  ❘  259  UPDATES TO THE MATCH, SPLIT, SEARCH, AND  REPLACE METHODS  The JavaScript string methods match, split, search, and replace were all made more general in  ES2015. Prior to ES2015, they were tied quite closely to regular expressions: match and search  required a regular expression, or a string they could turn into one; split and replace used a regular  expression if they were given one or coerced their argument to string if not.  As of ES2015, you can create your own objects to use with match, search, split, and replace  and have those methods hand off to your object if it has a particular feature the methods look for: a  method with a specific name. The names they look for are well-known Symbols  you learned about  well-known Symbols in Chapter 5 :  ➤➤ match: Looks for Symbol.match ➤➤ split: Looks for Symbol.split ➤➤ search: Looks for Symbol.search ➤➤ replace: Looks for Symbol.replace  If the object you pass in has the relevant method, the string method calls it, passing in the string, and  returns the result. That is, it defers to the method on your object.  Let’s use split as an example. As of ES2015, String’s split method conceptually looks like this   glossing over some minor details :     In String.prototype split separator  {     if  separator !== undefined && separator !== null  {         if  separator[Symbol.split] !== undefined  {             return separator[Symbol.split] this ;         }     }     const s = String separator ;     const a = [];        ...split the string on `s`, adding to `a`...     return a; }  As you can see, String.prototype.split hands off to its parameter’s Symbol.split method if it  has one. Otherwise, it does what it’s always done with a non-regular expression separator in the past.   It still supports using a regular expression as a separator because regular expressions have the   Symbol.split method now, so String’s split defers to that.  Let’s look at using replace with a different kind of search mechanism: one that looks for tokens in  the form {{token}} in the string and replaces them with matching properties from an object. See  Listing 10-7.   260  ❘  CHAPTER 10    TemplaTes, Tag FuncTions, and new sTring FeaTures  LISTING 10-7:  Non-regex replacer—non-regex-replacer.js     Defining the token replacer with configurable token matching class Replacer {     constructor rexTokenMatcher =  \{\{ [^}]+ \}\} g  {         this.rexTokenMatcher = rexTokenMatcher;     }       [Symbol.replace] str, replaceValue  {         str = String str ;         return str.replace              this.rexTokenMatcher,              _, token  => replaceValue[token]  ""          ;     } } Replacer.default = new Replacer  ;      Using the default token replacer with `replace` const str = "Hello, my name is {{name}} and I'm {{age}}."; const replaced = str.replace Replacer.default, {     name: "María Gonzales",     age: 32 } ; console.log replaced ;    "Hello, my name is María Gonzales and I'm 32."      Using a custom token const str2 = "Hello, my name is   and I'm  ."; const replacer = new Replacer   ]+ > g  ; const replaced2 = str2.replace replacer, {     name: "Joe Bloggs",     age: 45 } ; console.log replaced2 ;    "Hello, my name is Joe Bloggs and I'm 45."  The key thing to observe running Listing 10-7 is that String’s replace calls Replacer’s   Symbol.replace method; it no longer just accepts RegExp instances or strings.  You could do something similar with match, split, or search.  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Here are some old habits you might consider updating.  Use Template Literals Instead of String Concatenation  Where  Appropriate   Old habit: Using string concatenation to build strings from in-scope variables:  const formatUserName = user => {     return user.firstName + " " + user.lastName + "  " + user.handle + " "; };   Old Habits to New  ❘  261  New habit: It’s probably a matter of style, but you can use a template literal instead:  const formatUserName = user => {     return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}  ${user.handle} `; };  In fact, some people are considering the idea of always using template literals instead of string literals.   It’s not quite possible to do that everywhere, though, there are still a couple of places where only  string literals are allowed. The big ones are quoted property names in object initializers  you could  use a computed property name instead , module specifiers for static import export  Chapter 13 ,  and "use strict". But you can use template literals nearly anywhere else you’ve normally used a  string literal in the past.  Use Tag Functions and Template Literals for DSLs Instead of  Custom Placeholder Mechanisms  Old habit: Creating your own placeholder mechanisms when creating DSLs.  New habit: In situations where it makes sense, use tag functions and template literals, taking advan- tage of the substitution evaluation provided by the templates.  Use String Iterators  Old habit: Accessing characters in strings by index:  const str = "testing"; for  let i = 0; i < str.length; ++i  {     console.log str[i] ; }  const str = "testing"; for  const ch of str  {     console.log ch ; }  New habit: If you want to treat the string as a series of code points rather than code units, consider  using codePointAt or for-of or other Unicode-aware features:    New Array Features,  Typed Arrays  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ New array features  ➤➤ Typed arrays  ➤➤ DataView objects  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode  or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter, you’ll learn about many new features of arrays in ES2015+, including new fea- tures for traditional arrays and the new typed arrays.  Before getting into the meat of the chapter, a brief note about terminology: There are a cou- ple of words used to refer to the contents of arrays, the two most popular being “elements”  and “entries.” Although “elements” is probably used slightly more often than “entries,” I use  “entries” in this book to avoid confusion with DOM elements and because it’s the name of  the method on arrays, entries, that you use to get an iterator for the entries in the array. But  you’ll very often hear “elements” instead, including in most parts of the JavaScript specification.  “Element” is also used in one place in the standard API for typed arrays.   264  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  NEW ARRAY METHODS  ES2015  primarily , ES2016, and ES2019 added a host of new array methods, both for creating  arrays and for accessing and modifying their contents.  Array.of Signature:  arrayObject = Array.of value0[, value1[, ... ]]   Array.of creates and returns an array containing the values you pass to it as discrete arguments.  For instance:  const a = Array.of "one", "two", "three" ; console.log a ;    ["one", "two", "three"]  At first glance, this may seem unnecessary, since you could just use an array initializer:  const a = ["one", "two", "three"]; console.log a ;    ["one", "two", "three"]  But Array.of is useful for array subclasses, since they don’t have a literal form:  class MyArray extends Array {     niftyMethod   {            ...do something nifty...     } } const a = MyArray.of "one", "two", "three" ; console.log a instanceof MyArray ;    true console.log a ;    ["one", "two", "three"]  You learned in Chapter 4 that the prototype of the MyArray function is the Array function. That  means MyArray.of is inherited from Array. Array.of is smart enough look at the this it was called  with and, if it’s a constructor, to use that constructor to create the new array  if this isn’t a construc- tor, Array.of defaults to using Array . So without your having to override of, MyArray.of creates  an instance of MyArray.  Array.from  Signature:  arrayObject = Array.from items[, mapFn[, thisArg]]   Like Array.of, Array.from creates an array based on the arguments you pass it. But instead of  taking discrete values, it accepts any iterable or array-like1 object as its first argument and builds an  array using the values from that object, optionally applying a mapping function to them. If you give  Array.from null or undefined, it’ll throw an error; for nearly anything else that isn’t iterable or  array-like, it returns an empty array.  1  An array-like object is any object with a length property whose “entries” are properties with names in the canonical  string form of the integers in the range 0 through length – 1.   New Array Methods  ❘  265  As you know from Chapter 10, strings are iterable, and so Array.from can create an array from the  “characters”  Unicode code points  in the string:  const str = "123"; const a = Array.from str ; console.log a ;    ["1", "2", "3"]  Here’s an example of building an array from an array-like object:  const a = Array.from {length: 2, "0": "one", "1": "two"} ; console.log a ;    ["one", "two"]   The property names "0" and "1" could be written with numeric literals, but they end up as strings,  so I’ve used strings for emphasis here.   Array.from accepts an optional second argument, mapFn: a mapping function to apply to each value  as it’s being added to the array. For instance, if you wanted to take a string containing digits and get  an array of the digits as numbers, you could pass a conversion function in as mapFn:  const str = "0123456789"; const a = Array.from str, Number ; console.log a ;    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  The mapping function’s signature is mapFn value, index , where value is the value being mapped  and index is the index that the new value will have in the resulting array. This is similar to the argu- ments an Array.prototype.map callback receives, but there are two differences between from  when  mapping entries  and map:  ➤➤ The Array.from mapping callback does not receive the third argument that map callbacks  do: the source object being mapped. There was talk of including it, but it’s not very useful  when it’s an iterable rather than an array or array-like object, since indexing into it wouldn’t  work, so the team doing from decided it was best not to include the source object. ➤➤ While map only calls its callback for entries that exist in the source array  skipping   “missing” entries in sparse arrays , when dealing with an array-like object, from calls its  callback for every index in the range 0 through length - 1  inclusive , even if there is no  corresponding entry at that index.  Since the mapping function receives the index as the second argument, you need to be sure to avoid  the classic map pitfall of passing in a function that accepts multiple parameters and may get confused  by the second argument it receives. The classic example is using parseInt with map; that issue applies  to Array.from’s mapping function as well:  const str = "987654321"; const a = Array.from str, parseInt ; console.log a ;    [9, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, 4, 3, 2, 1]  parseInt accepts two parameters, the second being the radix to use  the number base—2 for binary,  10 for decimal, etc. . So it gets confused when map passes it the index as though it were a radix. The  NaNs in that example are because parseInt was called either with an invalid radix parameter or a  radix that the digit it was trying to parse didn’t fit in  the first worked because parseInt ignores it  if you pass a radix of 0 . For instance, the second call failed because 1 is an invalid radix. The third  call failed because 2 is a valid radix  binary , but the digit “7” is not valid in binary. As with map, the    266  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  answer is to use an arrow function or some other means of ensuring that the callback only receives  appropriate arguments. With parseInt, you usually want to be explicit with the radix anyway, so:  const str = "987654321"; const a = Array.from str, digit => parseInt digit, 10  ; console.log a ;    [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]  Aside from creating arrays from iterables and array-likes, another use case for Array.from is build- ing range arrays: arrays filled with numbers in a given range. For instance, to create an array with 100  entries with the values 0 through 99, you can use:  const a = Array.from {length: 100},  _, index  => index ;    Or: const a = Array.from Array 100 ,  _, index  => index ; console.log a ;    [0, 1, 2, 3, ... 99]  {length: 100} and Array 100  both create objects with a length property with the value 100  the  first is a plain object, the second is a sparse array . Array.from calls its mapping callback for each  index in the range 0 through 99  inclusive , passing in the value undefined for the first argument2  and the index as the second. Since the callback returns the index, the resulting array contains the  index values in its entries. You could generalize that into a rangeArray function:  function rangeArray start, end, step = 1  {     return Array.from          {length: Math.floor Math.abs end - start    Math.abs step  },          _, i  => start +  i * step       ; }   console.log rangeArray 0, 5  ;         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] console.log rangeArray 6, 11  ;        [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] console.log rangeArray 10, 20, 2  ;    [10, 12, 14, 16, 18] console.log rangeArray 4, -1, -1  ;    [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  Last but not least, Array.from accepts a third parameter, thisArg, which determines the value of  this in calls to mapFn. So if you had an object  example  with a method  method  and wanted to use  that method as the callback, you could use:  const array = Array.from Array 100 , example.method, example ;  to ensure that this within the call to method referred to the example object.  Array.prototype.keys  Signature:  keysIterator = theArray.keys    2  The code in the example receives that undefined argument as an _ parameter. A single underscore is a valid identifier  in JavaScript. It’s often chosen as the name for a parameter that isn’t used by the function.   New Array Methods ❘ 267      The  keys  method returns an iterator for the keys of the array. The keys of an array are the numbers  0 through  length – 1 . Example:      const a = ["one", "two", "three"];   for  const index of a.keys    {       console.log index ;   }        That outputs  0 , then  1 , then  2 .    There are a few things worth noting about the keys  method:  ➤   It returns an iterator, not an array.   ➤  Even though the names of array entries are technically strings  because traditional arrays   aren ’ t really arrays, as you learned in Chapter   5   ’ s “Property Order” section , the values  returned by the keys    method’s iterator are numbers.   ➤  All of the index values in the range  0 <= n < length  are returned by the iterator, even if   ➤  It does not include the names of enumerable properties that aren ’ t array indexes, if the  the array is sparse.   array has any.      Contrast those points with Object.keys someArray  , which would return an array, include the indexes as strings, omit the indexes of entries that aren ’ t present in a sparse array, and include names of other own  non-inherited  enumerable properties if the array has any.    Here ’ s an example of a sparse array, and how the keys  iterator includes the indexes for the gaps:      const a = [, "x", , , "y"];     for  const index of a.keys    {       console.log index, index in a ? "present" : "absent" ;   }        The array  a  has no entry at indexes 0, 2, or 3; it only has entries at indexes 1 and 4. That code out- puts the following:      0 "absent"   1 "present"   2 "absent"   3 "absent"   4 "present"        Array.prototype.values   Signature:  valuesIterator =     r  theArray  .values    y      const a = ["one", "two", "three"];   for  const index of a.values    {       console.log index ;   }        The  values  method is just like keys , but returns an iterator for the values in the array rather than  the keys. It’s the exact same iterator you get from the array itself. Example:   268  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  That outputs "one", then "two", then "three".  As with keys, which includes indexes for missing entries in sparse arrays, values includes the value  undefined for missing entries in the array:  const a = [, "x", , , "y"]; for  const value of a.values    {     console.log value ; }  That code outputs:  undefined "x" undefined undefined "y"  Array.prototype.entries  Signature:  entriesIterator = theArray.entries    const a = ["one", "two", "three"]; for  const entry of a.entries    {     console.log entry ; }  That outputs:  [0, "one"] [1, "two"] [2, "three"]  As a result, when you get undefined as a value from the values iterator, you don’t know whether  it means there was an entry with the value undefined in the array or a gap in a sparse array. If you  need to know, you probably don’t want to use the values method  you might want entries, though;  see the next section .  The entries method is effectively a combination of the keys and values methods: it returns an iter- ator for the entries in the array, where each entry it provides is an [index, value] array. Example:  When looping through the entries from entries, it’s common to use destructuring assignment  see  Chapter 7  to get the index and value as discrete variables or constants:  const a = ["one", "two", "three"]; for  const [index, value] of a.entries    {     console.log index, value ; }   New Array Methods  ❘  269  As with keys and values, the iteration includes an entry even when the entry doesn’t exist in the  array because it’s sparse; unlike with values, you can differentiate whether you’re getting an unde- fined value because of a gap or an actual entry by checking if the key  index  exists in the array:  const a = [, undefined, , , "y"]; for  const [index, value] of a.entries    {     console.log index, value, index in a ? "present" : "absent" ; }  Output:  0 "one" 1 "two" 2 "three"  Output:  0 undefined "absent" 1 undefined "present" 2 undefined "absent" 3 undefined "absent" 4 "y" "present"  Notice that the second undefined is for an entry that exists, while all the others are for gaps.  If the consumer of the iterator doesn’t have access to the original array, though, it’s impossible for  that consumer to know whether an undefined value in the [index, value] array is from a gap or  actually from undefined. The [index, value] arrays from the entries method always have both  the index and value, even for the sparse entries.  Array.prototype.copyWithin  Signature:  obj = theArray.copyWithin target, start[, end]   The copyWithin method copies entries from one part of the array to another part of the array,  handling any potential overlap issues and without increasing the length of the array. You specify the  target index  where to put the copied entries , the start index  where to start copying , and option- ally the end index  where to stop, exclusive; the default is the length of the array . It returns the array  it was called on  loosely speaking, see the “The copyWithin Return Value” inset for the details . If any  of the arguments is negative, it’s used as an offset from the end of the array. For instance, a start  of -2 in an array of length 6 is used as a start of 4 because 6 – 2 is 4. The start parameter is not  defined as optional, but if you leave it off, its effective value will be 0 because of the way the specifi- cation handles interpreting start’s value.  THE COPYWITHIN RETURN VALUE  When describing copyWithin, I said it “. . . returns the array it was called on.” That’s  not true, strictly speaking. It takes the this value it was called with, converts that to  an object if it isn’t one already, does its work, and then returns that object. In the  normal case, you call it on an array, so this refers to that array and that array is    270  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  returned. But if you used call or apply or similar to call it with this set to an  array-like object, it would return that array-like object, not an array. If you called it  with this set to a primitive, it would convert that primitive to an object and return  that object  if it didn’t throw an error because it couldn’t do the copying you’d  requested .  Here’s an example copying entries later in the array to an earlier place within it:  const a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"]; console.log "before", a ; a.copyWithin 2, 8 ; console.log "after ", a ;  That outputs:  before ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"] after  ["a", "b", "i", "j", "k", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"]  The call copied the entries starting at index 8 through the end of the array  "i", "j", "k"  within the  array, writing them starting at index 2. See Figure 11-1.  Before:  ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"]  After:  ["a", "b", "i", "j", "k", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"]  0  0  1  1  2  2  3  3  4  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  9  10  89  1  0  FIGURE 11-1   Note that it overwrote the previous entries at indexes 2-4 with the copies, it didn’t insert the copies.  Here’s an example copying earlier entries to a later location:  const a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]; console.log "before", a ; a.copyWithin 4, 2 ; console.log "after ", a ;  Output:  See Figure 11-2.   before ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"] after  ["a", "b", "c", "d", "c", "d", "e"]  Before:  ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]  After:  ["a", "b", "c", "d", "c", "d", "e"]  0  0  1  1  2  2  3  3  4  4  56  56  FIGURE 11-2    New Array Methods  ❘  271  Two things to notice in that example:  ➤➤ The copy isn’t a naïve forward-moving for loop. If it were, the operation would have   stepped on itself by copying "c" over "e" and later using that copied "c" for the last entry  instead of  correctly  using "e". Instead, copyWithin ensures that the entries being copied  are as they were before the operation began.  ➤➤ The copy stopped without extending the array. There’s no end point  third argument  in    the code, so the end point defaulted to the length of the array. The operation didn’t copy "f"  and "g" because doing so would have made the array longer. That’s why in Figure 11-2, even  though there are five source entries circled  because the call specified the entries at indexes 2  through 6 , only three were copied before the method ran into the end of the array.  This may seem like a very specific operation—that’s because it is. But it’s a common operation in  graphics applications. It’s included in Array primarily because it’s included in typed arrays  which  you’ll learn about later in this chapter , which are used for  among other things  graphics operations.  TC39 made the decision to keep the API of arrays and typed arrays as similar as possible. Since typed  arrays have a copyWithin method, arrays do too.  One interesting quirk of copyWithin that isn’t down to typed arrays is how it handles sparse arrays   as you’ll learn later, typed arrays are never sparse . copyWithin “copies” gaps, by deleting the entry  at the location it would copy a missing entry to:  function arrayString a  {     return Array.from a.keys  , key => {         return key in a ? a[key] : "*gap*";     } .join ", " ; } const a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", , "f", "g"]; console.log "before", arrayString a  ; a.copyWithin 1, 3 ; console.log "after ", arrayString a  ;  Note the gap in that array, there's no entry at index 4  "e" is missing . That outputs:  before a, b, c, d, *gap*, f, g after  a, d, *gap*, f, g, f, g  The gap that existed at index 4 was copied to index 2  and then the gap at index 4 was filled later  when the value at index 6 was copied into it .  Array.prototype.find  Signature:  result = theArray.find predicateFn[, thisArg]   The find method is for finding the value of the first matching entry in an array using a predicate  function. It calls the predicate function for each entry in the array, optionally using the given   thisArg as the this value for those calls, stopping and returning the value of the first entry for  which the predicate returns a truthy value, or returning undefined if it runs out of entries. Example:  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const firstEven = a.find value => value % 2 == 0 ; console.log firstEven ;    2   272  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  The predicate function is called with three arguments  the same ones used with forEach, map, some,  etc. : the value for that call, its index, and a reference to the object on which find was called  typi- cally an array . find stops the first time the predicate returns a truthy value, not visiting subsequent  entries in the array.  When you call find on an empty array it always returns undefined, since find runs out of entries  before the predicate returns a truthy value  since the predicate is never called :  const x = [].find value => true ; console.log x ;            undefined  Modifying the array during the find operation is generally not best practice, but if you do so the  results are well-defined: the range of entries that will be visited is determined before find starts its  loop; the value that will be used for an entry is its value as of when the entry is visited  they aren’t  stored in advance . This means:  ➤➤ If you add new entries at the end, they won’t be visited. ➤➤ If you change an entry that’s already been visited, it doesn’t get visited again. ➤➤ If you change an entry that hasn’t been visited yet, its new value is used when it’s visited. ➤➤ If you remove entries from the array, reducing its length, the gaps at the end will be visited,   with the usual value for gaps in arrays: undefined.  For instance, consider the following example:  const a = ["one", "two", "three"]; const x = a.find  value, index  => {     console.log `Visiting index ${index}: ${value}` ;     if  index === 0  {         a[2] = a[2].toUpperCase  ;     } else if  index === 1  {         a.push "four" ;     }     return value === "four"; } ; console.log x ;  That outputs:  Visiting index 0: one Visiting index 1: two Visiting index 2: THREE undefined  You don’t see the "four" entry get visited because it’s outside the range of the entries that will be  visited when find starts, but you do see "THREE" in uppercase, because it was changed before being  visited. find returns undefined  as shown by the console.log x  at the end  because the predicate  never returned a truthy value, since the "four" entry was never visited.   New Array Methods  ❘  273  Array.prototype.findIndex  Signature:  Example:  result = theArray.findIndex predicateFn[, thisArg]   findIndex is exactly like find except that findIndex returns the index of the entry for which the  predicate returned a truthy value, or -1 if it runs out of entries.  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const firstEven = a.findIndex value => value % 2 == 0 ; console.log firstEven ;    1 -- the first even value is the number 2 at index 1  Everything else is the same: the predicate function receives the same three arguments, the range of  entries visited by findIndex is determined in advance, the values visited are as they are when they’re  visited  not stored in advance , if you reduce the length of the array gaps are visited at the end, and  findIndex on an empty array always returns -1.  Array.prototype.fill  Signature:  obj = theArray.fill value[, start[, end]]   The fill method fills the array  or array-like object  you call it on using the given value, optionally  filling only the range defined by the start  default 0  and end  exclusive, default length  indexes. It  returns the array it was called on  effectively; its return value is like copyWithin, see the inset earlier .  If either start or end is negative, it’s used as an offset from the end of the array.  Example:  const a = Array 5 .fill 42 ; console.log a ;    [42, 42, 42, 42, 42]  In that example, Array 5  returns a sparse array with length set to 5, but no entries; fill then fills  the array with the given value  42 .  Common Pitfall: Using an Object As the Fill Value  The value you provide is just that: a value. It ends up in the array very much as though you did this  rather than calling Array.from:  const a = Array 5 ; const value = 42; for  let i = 0; i < a.length; ++i  {     a[i] = value; } console.log a ;    [42, 42, 42, 42, 42]   274  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  Keeping that in mind, what do you think the following code outputs?  const a = Array 2 .fill {} ; a[0].name = "Joe"; a[1].name = "Bob"; console.log a[0].name ;  If you said "Bob", nice one! Array 2 .fill {}  puts the same object in both entries in the array,  it doesn’t fill the array with a bunch of distinct objects. That means a[0] and a[1] both refer to the  same object. a[0].name = "Joe" sets that object’s name to "Joe", but then a[1].name = "Bob"  overwrites it with "Bob" instead.  If you want to put a distinct object in each array entry, Array.fill probably isn’t the tool to pick;  you’d use Array.from’s mapping callback:  But if you really wanted to use Array.fill, you’d fill the array first and then use map:  const a = Array.from {length: 2},    =>  {}  ; a[0].name = "Joe"; a[1].name = "Bob"; console.log a[0].name ;    Joe  const a = Array 2 .fill  .map    =>  {}  ; a[0].name = "Joe"; a[1].name = "Bob"; console.log a[0].name ;    Joe  You need the fill call there  which fills the array with undefined  because map doesn’t visit entries  that don’t exist, and Array 2  creates an array with length = 2 but with no entries in it.  Array.prototype.includes  Signature:  result = theArray.includes value[, start]   The includes method  added in ES2016  returns true if the given value is present in the array  according to the SameValueZero algorithm defined in the specification, or false if it isn’t. Option- ally, it starts the search at the provided start index if any; if start is negative, it’s used as an offset  from the end of the array.  Examples:  const a = ["one", "two", "three"]; console.log a.includes "two"  ;        true console.log a.includes "four"  ;       false console.log a.includes "one", 2  ;     false, "one" is before index 2  It’s a common misconception that includes value  is just a shorter way to write indexOf value   !== -1, but that’s not quite correct. indexOf uses the Strict Equality Comparison algorithm  like  ===  to check values, but SameValueZero  new in ES2015  differs from strict equality in how it treats  NaN. With strict equality, NaN doesn’t equal itself; with SameValueZero, it does:  const a = [NaN]; console.log a.indexOf NaN  !== -1 ;    false console.log a.includes NaN  ;          true   New Array Methods  ❘  275  Other than NaN, SameValueZero is just like Strict Equality, which means that negative zero and   positive zero are the same, so [-0].includes 0  returns true.  Array.prototype.flat  Added in ES2019, flat creates a new “flattened” array by taking each value from the original array  and, if the value is an array, taking its values to put in the result rather than the array itself:  const original = [     [1, 2, 3],     4,     5,     [6, 7, 8] ]; const flattened = original.flat  ; console.log flattened ;    => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  This mostly replaces a common idiom for flattening arrays using concat:  const flattened = [].concat.apply [], original ;    or const flattened = Array.prototype.concat.apply [], original ;  and is more efficient  though it usually doesn’t matter , as it doesn’t create and throw away tempo- rary arrays. However, flat doesn’t check Symbol.isConcatSpreadable  see Chapter 17 , so if   you have array-like objects with Symbol.isConcatSpreadable set to true, concat will spread them  but flat won’t; flat only spreads out actual arrays.  If you want that behavior, you can keep using  concat, perhaps with spread notation: const flattened = [].concat ...original ;.   By default flat flattens only one level  like concat , so arrays nested beyond one level don’t get  flattened:  const original = [     [1, 2, 3],     [         [4, 5, 6],         [7, 8, 9]     ] ]; const flattened = original.flat  ; console.log flattened ;    => [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];  const original = [     "a",     [         "b",         "c",         [             "d",  You can provide an optional depth argument to tell flat to do recursive flattening up to a given  depth: 1 = just one level  the default , 2 = two levels, etc. You can use Infinity to completely flatten  the structure regardless of how deep it is:   276  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys              "e",             [                 "f",                 "g",                 [                     "h",                     "i"                 ],             ],         ],     ],     "j" ]; const flattened = original.flat Infinity ; console.log flattened ;    => ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]  Array.prototype.flatMap  Also added in ES2019, flatMap is just like flat except that it passes each value through a mapping  function before flattening the result, and only flattens a single level:  const original = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const flattened = original.flatMap e => e === 3 ? ["3a", "3b", "3c"] : e ; console.log flattened ;    => [1, 2, "3a", "3b", "3c", 4]  The end result is exactly what you’d get by calling map and then calling flat on the result  with only  one level of flattening, the default :  const original = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const flattened = original.map e => e === 3 ? ["3a", "3b", "3c"] : e .flat  ; console.log flattened ;    => [1, 2, "3a", "3b", "3c", 4]  The only functional difference is that flatMap does it with just a single pass through the array  rather than two.  ITERATION, SPREAD, DESTRUCTURING  In ES2015, arrays got some other features, which are covered elsewhere in the book:  ➤➤ Arrays became iterable  see Chapter 6 . ➤➤ Array literals can include spread notation  see Chapter 6 . ➤➤ Arrays participate in destructuring  see Chapter 7.   STABLE ARRAY SORT  Until ES2019, the sorting algorithm used by the Array.prototype.sort method was defined as “not  necessarily stable,” meaning that if two entries are considered equal, their relative positions in the  resulting array might still get reversed.  This was also true of typed arrays like Int32Array.  As of  ES2019, sort is required to implement a stable sort  both for normal and typed arrays .   Typed Arrays  ❘  277  For example, with the old definition, this code sorting an array ignoring case sensitivity:  const a = ["b", "B", "a", "A", "c", "C"]; a.sort  left, right  => left.toLowerCase  .localeCompare right.toLowerCase    ; console.log a ;  was allowed to produce any of several different possible results:  ["a", "A", "b", "B", "c", "C"] - Equal entries weren't swapped  stable  ["A", "a", "B", "b", "C", "c"] - All equal entries were swapped  unstable  ["a", "A", "b", "B", "C", "c"] - Some equal entries were swapped  unstable  ["a", "A", "B", "b", "c", "C"] - " ["a", "A", "B", "b", "C", "c"] - " ["A", "a", "b", "B", "c", "C"] - " ["A", "a", "b", "B", "C", "c"] - " ["A", "a", "B", "b", "c", "C"] - "  As of ES2019, implementations are required to consistently produce only the first result: "a" must  come before "A"  because it did before the sort , "b" before "B", and "c" before "C".  TYPED ARRAYS  Overview  In this section you’ll learn about typed arrays: true arrays of primitive numeric values, added to  JavaScript in ES2015.  JavaScript’s traditional “arrays” famously aren’t really arrays, in the usual computer science defini- tion of a contiguous  all in a row  block of memory divided into fixed-size units. Instead, JavaScript’s  traditional arrays are just objects, like all other objects, with special handling around property names  that fit the spec’s definition of an “array index,”3 a special length property, a literal notation using  square brackets, and methods inherited from Array.prototype. That said, JavaScript engines are  free to optimize where optimizing doesn’t conflict with the spec  and they do .  JavaScript’s traditional arrays are powerful and useful, but sometimes you need a real array  par- ticularly when reading writing files or interoperating with graphics or mathematics APIs . For that  reason, ES2015 added true arrays to the language in the form of typed arrays.  Typed arrays are like traditional JavaScript arrays except:  ➤➤ Their entry values are always primitive numeric values: 8-bit integers, 32-bit floats, etc. ➤➤ All of the values in a typed array are of the same type  which depends on the type of the   array: Uint8Array, Float32Array, etc. .  ➤➤ They’re fixed-length: once you construct the array, you can’t change its length.4 ➤➤ Their values are stored in a contiguous memory buffer in a specified binary format.  3 A string in canonical numeric form that converts to an integer in the range 0 <= n < 232 – 1. 4 You’ll learn about one minor caveat here in Chapter 16.   278  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  ➤➤ Typed arrays cannot be sparse  they cannot have gaps in the middle , whereas traditional   arrays can be. For instance, with a traditional array you can do this:  . . . and the array will have only one entry, at index 9, without having entries at indexes 0  through 8:  const a = [];  a[9] = "nine";  console.log 9 in a ;    true  console.log 8 in a ;    false  console.log 7 in a ;    false  etc.   That’s not possible with a typed array.  ➤➤ Typed arrays can share memory  their underlying data buffer  with other typed arrays, even   of different types.  ➤➤ The data buffer of a typed array can be transferred or even shared across threads  for in-  stance, with web workers on a browser or worker threads in Node.js ; you’ll learn about this  in Chapter 16.  ➤➤ When getting or setting a typed array entry’s value, there’s always some form of conversion  involved  other than when using numbers with a Float64Array, since JavaScript’s numbers  are Float64s .  Table 11-1 lists the eleven types of typed arrays  based on the table “The TypedArray Constructors”  in the specification , giving the name of the type  which is also the global name of its constructor  function , the conceptual name of its value type, how many bytes of memory an entry in that array  takes, the abstract specification operation that converts values to the type, and a  brief  description.

All the usual object operations work with typed arrays. They have prototypes, meth- ods, and a length property; you can put non-entry properties on them just like you can traditional  JavaScript arrays; they’re iterable; and so on.  Let’s look at them in action.  Basic Use  Typed arrays don’t have a literal form. You can create a typed array by calling its constructor or using  its constructor’s of or from methods.  The constructors for each kind of typed array  Int8Array, Uint32Array, etc.  all have the same  available forms. Here’s a list using %TypedArray% as a placeholder for the various specific types   Int8Array, etc. , like the specification does:  ➤➤ new %TypedArray%  : Creates an array with length set to 0. ➤➤ new %TypedArray% length : Creates an array with length entries, each entry initially set   to all-bits-off  zero .  ➤➤ new %TypedArray% object : Creates an array by copying values from the given object by  using the object’s iterator, if it has one, or by treating it as array-like and using its length  and array index properties to read its contents.  ➤➤ new %TypedArray% typedArray : Creates an array by copying values from the given   typed array. This doesn’t go through the typed array’s iterator; it works directly with the   5  Numbers are converted to Float32 using the IEEE-754-2008 specification’s rules for converting 64-bit binary values to  32-bit binary values using the “round to nearest, ties to even” rounding mode.   280  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  underlying buffers for efficiency.  When the types of the arrays are the same, this can be an  extremely efficient memory copy.   ➤➤ new %TypedArray% buffer[, start[, length]] : Creates an array using the given buffer    this is covered in a later section on ArrayBuffer .  If you construct an array by providing a length, the entry values are set to all-bits-off, which is the  value 0 for all of the kinds of typed arrays:  const a1 = new Int8Array 3 ; console.log a1 ;    Int8Array 3 : [0, 0, 0]  When you assign values to a typed array’s entries  during construction by providing an object or  other typed array, or afterward , the JavaScript engine passes them through the conversion function  listed in Table 11-1. Here’s an example of doing so after construction:  const a1 = new Int8Array 3 ; a1[0] = 1; a1[1] = "2";    Note the string a1[2] = 3; console.log a1 ;    Int8Array 3 : [1, 2, 3] – note 2 is a number  In this example, all three values were converted, but it’s most obvious with the value "2", which  was converted from a string to an 8-bit integer.  1 and 3 were also converted, at least in theory, from  the JavaScript standard number type—IEEE-754 double-precision binary floating point—to 8-bit  integers.   Similarly, here are examples using of and from:     Using `of`: const a2 = Int8Array.of 1, 2, "3" ; console.log a2 ;    Int8Array 3 : [1, 2, 3] – "3" was converted to 3    Using `from` with an array-like object: const a3 = Int8Array.from {length: 3, 0: 1, 1: "2"} ; console.log a3 ;    Int8Array 3 : [1, 2, 0] – undefined was converted to 0    Using `from` with an array: const a4 = Int8Array.from [1, 2, 3] ; console.log a4 ;    Int8Array 3 : [1, 2, 3]  In the example using a3, since there’s no value for the "2" property in the array-like object even  though the length of the array-like object is 3, the from method gets undefined when it gets the "2"  property, then converts it to 0 using the conversion operation for Int8Array.  And again, all of those  values were converted in theory, but it’s most obvious with the string and undefined.   In a moment you’ll see a more complex example after learning about ArrayBuffers; first, let’s briefly  look at value conversions in more detail.  Value Conversion Details  Let’s look at value conversion in more detail.  The conversion operations performed when assigning values to array entries always result in a value,  rather than throwing an exception if the value provided cannot be converted. For instance, assign- ing the string "foo" to an entry in an Int8Array sets that entry’s value to 0 rather than throwing an  error. In this section, you’ll learn how the conversion gets done.   Typed Arrays  ❘  281  For floating-point arrays, it’s fairly straightforward:  1.  When assigning to a Float64 entry, the value is first converted to a standard JavaScript num- ber if necessary in the usual way, and then stored as-is, since standard JavaScript numbers are  Float64 values.  2.  When assigning to a Float32 entry, the value is first converted to a standard JavaScript   number if necessary and then converted to Float32 using the IEEE-754-2008 specification’s  “round to nearest, ties to even” rounding mode.  When assigning to integer-typed entries, it’s more complicated:  1.  The input value is converted to a standard JavaScript number if it isn’t one already. 2.   If the result of Step 1 is NaN, positive or negative 0, or negative infinity, the value 0 is used  and the following steps are skipped. If the result of Step 1 is positive infinity, the value 0 is  used unless the array is a Uint8ClampedArray in which case the value 255 is used; in both  cases, the following steps are skipped.  Fractional values are truncated toward zero.  3.  4.   If the array is a Uint8ClampedArray, a range check is used to determine the entry value: a   b   Otherwise, the value is used as-is.  If the value from Step 3 is less than 0, 0 is used; if it’s greater than 255, 255 is used.  5.  Otherwise  the array is unclamped :  a   A modulo operation  not remainder, see the “Modulo vs. Remainder” inset  using 2n as  the divisor is used to ensure the value is in the overall unsigned range for the size of the  integer entry  where n is the number of bits, for example 28 with an Int8Array .  b    For arrays with signed entries, if the value resulting from the modulo operation  which  is always zero or positive, since 2n is positive  is outside the positive range of the entry,  2n is subtracted from it and the result is used.  MODULO VS. REMAINDER  Typed array integer value conversion uses a modulo operation at one stage. This is  not the same operation as the remainder operator  % , despite the operator com- monly—but incorrectly—being called the “modulo operator.” Modulo and remainder  are the same operation when both operands are positive, but they can differ other- wise, depending on which flavor of modulo you use.  The spec defines its abstract modulo operation like this:  The notation “x modulo y”  y must be finite and nonzero  computes a   value k of the same sign as y  or zero  such that abs k  < abs y    and x - k = q × y for some integer q.   282  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  Since the modulo operations used in relation to typed array values always use a posi- tive number for y  for instance, y = 28, which is 256, for a Uint8Array , the result  of those operations will always be positive numbers within the full unsigned range of   possible values for the size of the entry. For signed arrays, a subsequent operation  converts values that are beyond the positive range of the type into negative numbers.  For example, assigning to an entry in an Int8Array, the number 25.4 becomes 25, -25.4  becomes -25:  const a = new Int8Array 1 ; a[0] = 25.4; console.log a[0] ;    25 a[0] = -25.4; console.log a[0] ;    -25  const a = new Uint8Array 1 ; a[0] = -25.4; console.log a[0] ;    231  How did -25.4 become 231?!  For the unsigned types  other than Uint8ClampedArray , conversion of negative values may seem  surprising. Consider:  The first parts are easy: -25.4 is already a number so you don’t have to convert it to one, and when  you truncate it toward zero, you get –25. Now it’s time for that modulo operation  see the inset ear- lier . One way to compute that modulo is the following code snippet, where value is the value  —25   and max is 2n  28, which is 256, in this 8-bit example :  const value = -25; const max = 256; const negative = value < 0; const remainder = Math.abs value  % max; const result = negative ? max - remainder : remainder;  If you follow that through, you end up with 231. But there’s another more direct way to get there: the  signed 8-bit integer value –25, in the two’s complement form used with signed values in typed arrays,  has the same bit pattern as the unsigned 8-bit integer value 231. The pattern is 11100111 in both  cases. The specification just uses mathematics rather than bit patterns to get there.  ArrayBuffer: The Storage Used by Typed Arrays  All typed arrays use an ArrayBuffer for the storage of their values. An ArrayBuffer is an object  with an associated contiguous data block of a fixed size, given in bytes. Typed arrays read and   write data in their ArrayBuffer’s data block according to the type of data the array provides: an  Int8 Array accesses bytes in the buffer and uses the bits as signed  two’s complement  8-bit integers;  a Uint16Array accesses pairs of bytes in the buffer, using them as unsigned 16-bit integers; etc. You  can’t directly access the data in the buffer, you can only access it through a typed array or a DataView   which you’ll learn about in a bit .   Typed Arrays  ❘  283  The code in the earlier examples created typed arrays directly, without explicitly creating an Array- Buffer. When you do that, a buffer of the appropriate size is created for you. So, for instance, new  Int8Array 5  creates a five-byte buffer; new Uint32Array 5  creates a 20-byte buffer  since each  of the five entries takes four bytes of storage .  You can access the buffer attached to a typed array via the array’s buffer property:  const a = new Int32Array 5 ; console.log a.buffer.byteLength ;    20  bytes  console.log a.length ;               5  entries, each taking four bytes   You can also create the ArrayBuffer explicitly, then pass it to the typed array constructor when  creating the array:  const buf = new ArrayBuffer 20 ; const a = new Int32Array buf ; console.log buf.byteLength ;         20  bytes  console.log a.length ;               5  entries, each taking four bytes   The size you give the ArrayBuffer constructor is in bytes.  If you try to use a buffer that isn’t the right size for the typed array you’re creating, you get an error:  const buf = new ArrayBuffer 18 ; const a = new Int32Array buf ;    RangeError: byte length of Int32Array                                   should be a multiple of 4   Later in this chapter you’ll see how to use only part of a buffer.   To help you create buffers of the right size, typed array constructors have a property you can use  when creating the buffer: BYTES_PER_ELEMENT.6 So to create a buffer for a five-entry Int32Array,  you’d do this:  const buf = new ArrayBuffer Int32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT * 5 ;  You’d only do that if you had some reason for creating the buffer separately; otherwise you’d just  call the typed array constructor and use the resulting array’s buffer property if you needed access to  the buffer.  Now that you’ve seen ArrayBuffer, let’s look at a more real-world example of using typed arrays:  reading a file in a web browser and checking to see if it’s a Portable Network Graphics  PNG  file.  See Listing 11-1. You can run that locally using the code from Listing 11-1  read-file-as-array- buffer.js  along with read-file-as-arraybuffer.html, both available in the downloads for  the chapter.  LISTING 11-1:  Reading a local file and checking if it’s a PNG—read-file-as-arraybuffer.js  const PNG_HEADER = Uint8Array.of 0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A ; function isPNG byteData  {     return byteData.length >= PNG_HEADER.length &&            PNG_HEADER.every  b, i  => b === byteData[i] ;  continues  6  Remember I said at the beginning of this chapter that “element” is used in one place in the JavaScript standard library  in relation to typed arrays? This is that place, the name of this property.   284  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  LISTING 11-1   continued   } function show msg  {     const p = document.createElement "p" ;     p.appendChild document.createTextNode msg  ;     document.body.appendChild p ; } document.getElementById "file-input" .addEventListener      "change",     function event  {         const file = this.files[0];         if  !file  {             return;         }         const fr = new FileReader  ;         fr.readAsArrayBuffer file ;         fr.onload =    => {             const byteData = new Uint8Array fr.result ;             show `${file.name} ${isPNG byteData  ? "is" : "is not"} a PNG file.` ;         };         fr.onerror = error => {             show `File read failed: ${error}` ;         };     }  ;  PNG files start with a specific 8-byte header. The code in Listing 11-1 responds to a user   choosing a file in the type="file" input by using the File API’s FileReader object to read it as an  ArrayBuffer  accessible via the FileReader’s result property , and then checking for that 8-byte  header on the raw data received. Since the code in this example works with unsigned bytes, it uses a  Uint8Array backed by the buffer from the FileReader.  Notice that FileReader is agnostic: it just provides the ArrayBuffer, leaving it to the code using  the buffer to decide whether to access it byte-by-byte  as in the example in Listing 11-1  or in 16-bit  words, or 32-bit words, or even a combination of those.  Later you’ll see how a single ArrayBuffer  can be used by multiple typed arrays so you can access one section using, say, Uint8Array, but  another section using, say, Uint32Array.   Endianness  Byte Order   ArrayBuffers store bytes. Most typed arrays have entries that take multiple bytes of storage. For  instance, each entry in a Uint16Array requires two bytes of storage: a high-order byte  or “high  byte”  containing multiples of 256 and a low-order byte  or “low byte”  containing multiples of 1,  kind of like the “tens column” and the “ones column” in the base 10 counting system most of us use.  In the value 258  0x0102 in hexadecimal , the high-order byte contains 0x01 and the low-order byte  contains 0x02. To get the value, you take the high-order byte’s value, multiply by 256, and add in the  low-order byte’s value: 1 * 256 + 2 is 258.  So far so good, but: what order should the bytes be in, in memory? Should the high byte come first,  or the low byte? There’s no one answer; both ways are used. If the value is stored in high byte low    Typed Arrays  ❘  285  byte order, it’s in big-endian order  the big end—the high byte—is first . If the value is stored in low  byte high byte order, it’s in little-endian order  the little end—the low byte—is first . See Figure 11-3.  Big endian: Little endian:  Bytes  earlier to later  25 C7 39 21 01 02 5F 9B A1 03 33 FA B6 62 97 5D C7 25 21 39 02 01 9B 5F 03 A1 33 B6 FA 62 5D 97  The value 0x0102  258 in decimal  in context, in both big-endian and little-endian order  FIGURE 11-3   You’re probably wondering: if both are used, what determines which is used when? There are two  fundamental answers to that:  ➤➤ The machine’s computer architecture  in particular the CPU architecture  typically deter-  mines the endianness of values in memory on that system. If you tell the computer to store  0x0102 at a particular memory address, the CPU will write that value using its intrinsic  endianness. The x86 architecture used by Intel’s and AMD’s mainstream CPUs is little- endian, and so the vast majority of desktop computers use little-endian order. The PowerPC  architecture, used by older Macintosh computers before Apple switched to x86, is natively  big-endian, though it has a mode switch that can make it little-endian instead.  ➤➤ File formats, network protocols, etc., need to specify endianness to ensure they’re correctly   handled across different architectures. In some cases, the format dictates the endianness: the  Portable Network Graphics  PNG  image format uses big-endian, as does the Transmission  Control Protocol  the TCP in TCP IP  for integers in headers, such as port numbers.  In fact,  big-endian is sometimes called “network byte order.”  In other cases, the format or protocol  allows for specifying the endianness of the data within the data itself: the Tagged Image  File Format  TIFF  starts with two bytes, which are either the characters II  for “Intel”  byte order, little-endian  or MM  for “Motorola” byte order, big-endian  because when the  format was being developed in the 1980s, Intel CPUs used little-endian and Motorola CPUs  used big-endian. The multiple byte values stored in the file use the order defined by that  initial tag.  Typed arrays use the endianness of the computer on which they’re being used. The rationale for that  is that typed arrays are used to work with native APIs  such as WebGL , and so the data sent to the  native API should be in the machine’s native endianness. Your code writing the data writes to your  typed array  for example, a Uint16Array, Uint32Array, or similar , and the typed array writes to  the ArrayBuffer in the endianness of the machine where the code is running; your code doesn’t have  to worry about it. When you pass that ArrayBuffer to the native API, it will use the native endian- ness of the platform on which the code is running.  That doesn’t mean you never have to worry about endianness, though. When you read a file  like  a PNG  or network data stream  like a TCP packet  that’s defined as being in a specific order  big- endian or little-endian , you can’t assume that order is the same as the platform your code is running  on, which means you can’t use a typed array to access it. You need another tool: DataView.   286  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  DataView: Raw Access to the Buffer  DataView objects provide raw access to the data in an ArrayBuffer, with methods to read that  data in any of the numeric forms provided by typed arrays  Int8, Uint8, Int16, Uint16, etc. , with the  option of reading multi-byte data in little-endian or big-endian order.  Suppose you’re reading a PNG file, as the code from Listing 11-1 did earlier. PNG defines that its  various multi-byte integer fields are in big-endian format, but you can’t assume your JavaScript code  is running on a big-endian platform.  In fact, it’s likely not to be, as little-endian is used by most—but  not all—desktop, mobile, and server platforms.  In Listing 11-1 it didn’t matter because the code just  checked to see if the file was a PNG by checking an eight-byte signature one byte at a time. It didn’t  involve any multi-byte numbers. But suppose you want to get the dimensions of the PNG image?  That requires reading big-endian Uint32 values.  That’s where DataView comes in. You can use it to read values from an ArrayBuffer while being  explicit about endianness. You’ll see some code in a moment, but first a very brief note about the  PNG file format.  You saw in Listing 11-1 that a PNG file starts with an 8-byte signature that doesn’t vary. After that, a  PNG is a series of “chunks,” where each chunk is in this format:  ➤➤ length: The length of the data segment of the chunk  Uint32, big-endian  ➤➤ type: The chunk’s type  four characters from a restricted character set,7 one byte per   character, although the specification encourages implementations to treat them as binary  data, not characters   ➤➤ data: The chunk’s data, if any  length bytes, format varies depending on the chunk type  ➤➤ crc: The chunk’s CRC value  Uint32, big-endian   The PNG specification also requires that the first chunk  immediately after the 8-byte header  must  be an “image header”  “IHDR”  chunk providing basic information about the image, such as its  width and height in pixels, its color depth, etc. The width is the first Uint32 in the chunk’s data area;  the height is the second Uint32. Both, again, in big-endian order.  Suppose you wanted to get the width and height of the PNG from the ArrayBuffer provided by a  FileReader. You might first check that the 8-byte PNG header is correct, and perhaps also that the  first chunk’s type is indeed IHDR; then provided those are both correct, you know that the width is  the Uint32 at byte offset 16 in the data  the first 8 bytes are the PNG header, the next 4 are the length  of the IHDR chunk, and the next 4 are the type of the IHDR chunk; 8 + 4 + 4 = 16  and that the  height is the next Uint32 after that  at byte offset 20 . You can read those Uint32 values in big-endian  format, even on little-endian machines, using DataView’s getUint32 method:  const PNG_HEADER_1 = 0x89504E47;    Big-endian first Uint32 of PNG header const PNG_HEADER_2 = 0x0D0A1A0A;    Big-endian second Uint32 of PNG header const TYPE_IHDR = 0x49484452;       Big-endian type of IHDR chunk    ...  7  The allowed chunk name characters are a subset of ISO 646, specifically the letters A–Z and a–z. These are consistent  across all variants of ISO 646  and are the same as ASCII and Unicode .   Typed Arrays  ❘  287  fr.onload =    => {     const dv = new DataView fr.result ;     if  dv.byteLength >= 24 &&         dv.getUint32 0  === PNG_HEADER_1 &&         dv.getUint32 4  === PNG_HEADER_2 &&         dv.getUint32 12  === TYPE_IHDR  {         const width = dv.getUint32 16 ;         const height = dv.getUint32 20 ;         show `${file.name} is ${width} by ${height} pixels` ;     } else {         show `${file.name} is not a PNG file.` ;     } };   The downloads contain a runnable version of this in read-png-info.html and read-png-info.js;  there’s a PNG called sample.png.   getUint32 accepts an optional second parameter, littleEndian, which you can set to true to  read the value in little-endian format instead. The default if it’s not supplied  as in this example  is  big-endian.  If that code had used a Uint32Array instead, it would have used the endianness of the platform. If  that didn’t happen to be big-endian  and again, most systems are little-endian , the code checking   the PNG header and IHDR chunk type would fail.  See the downloads for read-png-info-  incorrect.html and read-png-info-incorrect.js.  Even if you updated the header and type  checks to use bytes instead, and only used the Uint32Array for reading the width and height, on a  little-endian platform you’d get wildly incorrect values for them  try read-png-info-incorrect2. html and read-png-info-incorrect2.js . For instance, with sample.png, you’d get “sample.png  is 3355443200 by 1677721600 pixels” instead of “sample.png is 200 by 100 pixels.”  Sharing an ArrayBuffer Between Arrays  An ArrayBuffer can be shared between multiple typed arrays, in two ways:  ➤➤ Without overlap: Each array using only its own part of the buffer ➤➤ With overlap: Arrays sharing the same part of the buffer  Sharing Without Overlap  Listing 11-2 shows a Uint8Array using the first part of an ArrayBuffer while a Uint16Array uses  the rest of it.  LISTING 11-2:  Sharing ArrayBuffer without overlapping—sharing-arraybuffer-without-overlap.js  const buf = new ArrayBuffer 20 ; const bytes = new Uint8Array buf, 0, 8 ; const words = new Uint16Array buf, 8 ; console.log buf.byteLength ;    20  20 bytes  console.log bytes.length ;      8  eight bytes  console.log words.length ;      6  six two-byte [16 bit] words = 12 bytes    288  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  You might do something like this if you were given a buffer with data you needed to access, and you  needed to access the first part as unsigned bytes, but the second part as unsigned 16-bit words  in the  platform-specific endianness .  In order to use only part of the buffer, the code uses the final constructor signature mentioned  but  not described  earlier:  new %TypedArray% buffer[, start[, length]]   Those parameters are:  ➤➤ buffer: The ArrayBuffer to use ➤➤ start: The offset  in bytes  from the beginning of the buffer at which to start using it; the   default is 0  start at the beginning   ➤➤ length: The length for the new typed array in entries  not bytes ; the default is however   many entries will fit in the remainder of the ArrayBuffer  When creating the Uint8Array with the code new Uint8Array buf, 0, 8 , the 0 says to start at  the beginning of the ArrayBuffer, and the 8 says to make the Uint8Array eight entries long. When  creating the Uint16Array with new Uint16Array buf, 8 , the 8 says to start at byte offset 8 and  by leaving off the length argument, it says to use the rest of the ArrayBuffer. You can find out what  part of the buffer the arrays are using by looking at their byteOffset and byteLength properties:  console.log bytes.byteOffset ;    0 console.log bytes.byteLength ;    8 console.log words.byteOffset ;    8 console.log words.byteLength ;    12  Keeping in mind that the third argument is a count of entries, not bytes, what would you use as the  third argument to the Uint16Array constructor if you wanted to supply it explicitly without chang- ing what the code does?  If you said 6, good job! The length is always in entries, not bytes. It’s tempting to say 12  the num- ber of bytes to use  or  if it weren’t for the name “length”  20  the offset of the end of the part of  the buffer you want to use , but length always being the number of entries is consistent with the  %TypedArray% length  constructor.  Sharing with Overlap  Listing 11-3 shows two arrays, a Uint8Array and a Uint16Array sharing the same ArrayBuffer   all of it .  LISTING 11-3:  Sharing ArrayBuffer with overlap—sharing-arraybuffer-with-overlap.js  const buf = new ArrayBuffer 12 ; const bytes = new Uint8Array buf ; const words = new Uint16Array buf ; console.log words[0] ;    0 bytes[0] = 1; bytes[1] = 1;   Typed Arrays  ❘  289  console.log bytes[0] ;    1 console.log bytes[1] ;    1 console.log words[0] ;    257  Note that words[0] starts out being 0, but after we assign 1 to bytes[0] and also to bytes[1],  words[0] becomes 257  0x0101 in hexadecimal . That’s because the two arrays are using the same  underlying storage  the ArrayBuffer . So by writing 1 to byte[0] and also to byte[1], we wrote a  1 to both bytes that make up the single words[0] entry. As discussed earlier in the “Endianness  Byte  Order ” section, one of those is a high-order byte and the other a low-order byte. By putting the value  1 in both of them, we get the 16-bit value 1 * 256 + 1, which is 257  0x0101 . So that’s the value  you get from words[0].  Suppose you changed the code so that instead of assigning 1 to bytes[1], you assigned 2. What value  would you get in words[0]?  If you said “It depends,” nice one! You’d probably get 513  0x0201  because you’re probably run- ning the code on a little-endian platform and so bytes[1] is the big end  the high byte , so the result  is 2 * 256 + 1 = 513. But if you’re using a little-endian platform, you’d get 258  0x0102  because  bytes[1] is the low end  the low byte , so the result is 1 * 256 + 2 = 258.  Subclassing Typed Arrays  You can subclass typed arrays  perhaps so you have your own custom methods  in the usual ways:  class syntax or using a function with Reflect.construct  you’ll learn about Reflect in   Chapter 14 . It’s probably only really useful for adding further utility methods. In general, it’s   probably best to include a typed array in a class via aggregation  as a field the class uses behind the  scenes  rather than via inheritance.  If you do subclass a typed array class, note the restrictions on map and filter discussed in the fol- lowing “Standard Array Methods” section.  Typed Array Methods  Standard Array Methods  Typed arrays have most of the usual array methods, though not all, and a couple of methods specific  to typed arrays.  Typed arrays implement most of the same methods as traditional arrays using the same algorithms, in  some cases with some slight tweaking discussed in this section.  However, since typed arrays are fixed-length, they don’t have any of the methods that would  poten- tially  involve changing the length of the array: pop, push, shift, unshift, or splice.  Typed arrays also don’t have flat, flatMap, or concat. flat and flatMap don’t make sense for  typed arrays, since typed arrays cannot contain nested arrays. Similarly, the flattening behavior of  concat doesn’t apply to typed arrays, and concat’s other operations can be implemented using of  and spread notation  since typed arrays are iterable :  const a1 = Uint8Array.from [1, 2, 3] ; const a2 = Uint8Array.from [4, 5, 6] ;   290  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  const a3 = Uint8Array.from [7, 8, 9] ; const all = Uint8Array.of ...a1, ...a2, ...a3 ; console.log all ;    Uint8Array [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]  Prototype methods that create new arrays  such as filter, map, and slice  create arrays of the same  type as the typed array you call them on. For filter and slice, that’s probably not going to lead to  any surprises, but it can for map. For example:  const a1 = Uint8Array.of 50, 100, 150, 200 ; const a2 = a1.map v => v * 2 ; console.log a2 ;    Uint8Array [ 100, 200, 44, 144 ]  Notice what happened to the last two entries: their values wrapped, because the new array is also a  Uint8Array and so it can’t hold the values 300  150 * 2  or 400  200 * 2 .  The implementations of map, filter, and slice on typed arrays have another restriction: if you  subclass a typed array, you can’t use Symbol.species  see Chapter 4  to make methods like map and  slice create non-typed arrays. For instance, this won’t work:  class ByteArray extends Uint8Array {     static get [Symbol.species]   {         return Array;     } } const a = ByteArray.of 3, 2, 1 ; console.log a.map v => v * 2  ;    => TypeError: Method %TypedArray%.prototype.map called on       incompatible receiver [object Array]  You could have them create a different kind of typed array  odd though that would be , but not a  non-typed array. If you wanted to have a subclass that did that, you’d need to override the methods in  the subclass. For instance:  class ByteArray extends Uint8Array {     static get [Symbol.species]   {         return Array;     }     map fn, thisArg  {         const ctor = this.constructor[Symbol.species];         return ctor.from this .map fn, thisArg ;     }        ...and similar for `filter`, `slice`, and `subarray` } const a = ByteArray.of 3, 2, 1 ; console.log a.map v => v * 2  ;    [ 6, 4, 2 ]  %TypedArray%.prototype.set  Signature:  theTypedArray.set array[, offset]   set sets multiple values in the typed array from the “array” you provide  which can be either a typed  array, a non-typed array, or an array-like object—though not just an iterable , optionally starting  writing at a given offset  given in entries, not bytes  within the typed array. set always copies the  entire array you provide  there aren’t any parameters for selecting a range within the source array .   Typed Arrays  ❘  291  You could use set to combine multiple typed arrays:  const all = new Uint8Array a1.length + a2.length + a3.length ; all.set a1 ; all.set a2, a1.length ; all.set a3, a1.length + a2.length ;  Note how the second set starts writing just after the last entry written by the first, and the third just  after the last entry written by the second.  Note that set specifically requires an array, typed array, or array-like object. It doesn’t handle itera- bles. To use an iterable with set, spread it into an array first  or use the from method of an appropri- ate array or typed array constructor, etc. .  %TypedArray%.prototype.subarray  Signature:  newArray = theTypedArray.subarray begin, end   subarray creates a new typed array for a subset of the array you call it on that shares the original  array’s buffer  that is, the arrays share the same data .  ➤➤ begin is the index of the first entry in the source array that should be shared with the sub-  array. If it’s negative, it’s used as an offset from the end of the array. If you leave it off, 0  will be used.  ➤➤ end is the index of the first entry not to share; if it’s negative, it’s used as an offset from the   end of the array. It’s not technically specified as optional, but if you leave it off, the length of  the array is used.  Both indexes are in entries, not bytes.  Here’s an example:  const wholeArray = Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ; const firstHalf = wholeArray.subarray 0, 5 ; console.log wholeArray ;    Uint8Array [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] console.log firstHalf ;     Uint8Array [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] firstHalf[0] = 100; console.log wholeArray ;    Uint8Array [ 100, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] console.log firstHalf ;     Uint8Array [ 100, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] const secondHalf = wholeArray.subarray -5 ; console.log wholeArray ;    Uint8Array [ 100, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] console.log secondHalf ;    Uint8Array [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] secondHalf[1] = 60; console.log wholeArray ;    Uint8Array [ 100, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 60, 7, 8, 9 ] console.log secondHalf ;    Uint8Array [ 5, 60, 7, 8, 9 ]  Notice how assigning to firstHalf[0] changes the value at wholeArray[0] as well, since   firstHalf and wholeArray share the same buffer, starting at the very beginning of it. Similarly,  assigning to secondHalf[1] changes the value at wholeArray[6], because secondHalf and  wholeArray share the same buffer, but with secondHalf using only the second half of it.   292  ❘  CHAPTER 11    New ArrAy FeAtures, typed ArrAys  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Most of what you’ve learned in this chapter has related to new things you couldn’t do before, but  there are still have a couple of habits you might tweak.  Use find and findIndex to Search Arrays Instead of Loops   Where Appropriate   Old habit: Finding entries  or their indexes  in arrays using a for loop or the some method, etc.:  let found; for  let n = 0; n < array.length; ++n  {     if  array[n].id === desiredId  {         found = array[n];         break;     } }  New habit: Consider using find  or findIndex  instead:  let found = array.find value => value.id === desiredId ; Use Array.fill to Fill Arrays Rather Than Loops  Old habit: Filling arrays of values with loops:     Static value const array = []; while  array.length < desiredLength  {     array[array.length] = value; }      Dynamic value const array = []; while  array.length < desiredLength  {     array[array.length] = determineValue array.length ; }  New habit: Use Array.fill or Array.from instead:     Static value const array = Array desiredLength .fill value ;      Dynamic value const array = Array.from      Array desiredLength ,      _, index  => determineValue index   ;  Use readAsArrayBuffer Instead of readAsBinaryString  Old habit: Using readAsBinaryString on FileReader instances, working with the result data via  charCodeAt.  New habit: Use readAsArrayBuffer instead, working with the data via typed arrays.   Maps and Sets  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ Maps  ➤➤ Sets  ➤➤ WeakMaps  ➤➤ WeakSets  WROX.COM CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode  or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter, you’ll learn about ES2015+’s Maps, Sets, WeakMaps, and WeakSets. Maps store  key value pairs, where the key and value can be  almost  anything. Sets store unique values.   WeakMaps are similar to Maps, but the keys are objects and those objects are held weakly   they can be garbage collected, which removes the entry from the map . WeakSets hold unique  objects weakly.  MAPS  You often want to create a map of one thing to another, for instance a map of IDs to objects that  have that ID. In JavaScript, we’ve often used  some say abused  objects for that. But since it’s not  what objects are designed for, there are some pragmatic issues with using objects for generic maps:  ➤➤ The keys can only be strings  or Symbols as of ES2015 . ➤➤ Until ES2015, you couldn’t count on the order if you needed to loop through the  entries in the object; and as you learned in Chapter 5, even though ES2015 added    294  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets  order, relying on it isn’t usually a good idea because the order depends on both the order  the properties were added to the object and the form of the property key  strings in the  canonical integer index form come first, numerically .  ➤➤ Objects are optimized by JavaScript engines on the assumption that they mostly only have   properties added to them and updated, not removed.  ➤➤ Until ES5, you couldn’t create an object without a prototype with properties like toString   and hasOwnProperty on it. While unlikely to conflict with your own keys, it was still a  mild concern.  Maps deal with all of those issues. In a Map:  ➤➤ Both the keys and the values can be any value at all  including an object .1 ➤➤ The order of entries is defined: it’s the order in which the entries were added  updating an   entry’s value doesn’t change its place in the order .  ➤➤ JavaScript engines optimize Maps differently from objects, since their use cases are   different.  ➤➤ Maps are empty by default.  Basic Map Operations  The basics of Maps  creating, adding, accessing, and removing entries  are quite straightforward; let’s  run through them quickly.  You can run all of the code in this section using the basic-map-  operations.js file from the downloads.   To create a map, use the constructor  more on this later in the chapter :  To add entries to it, use the set method to associate a key with a value:  const m = new Map  ;  m.set 60, "sixty" ; m.set 4, "four" ;  The keys in that example are the numbers 60 and 4  the first argument to each set call ; the values  are the strings "sixty" and "four"  the second argument .  The set method returns the map, so you can chain multiple calls together if you like:  m.set 50, "fifty" .set 3, "three" ;  To see how many entries are in the map, use its size property:  console.log `Entries: ${m.size}` ;          Entries: 4  To get the value for a key, use the get method:  let value = m.get 60 ; console.log `60: ${value}` ;                60: sixty console.log `3: ${m.get 3 }` ;              3: three  1 There’s one minor caveat here; see details in the “Key Equality” section.   Maps  ❘  295  The get method returns undefined if there’s no entry for the key:  console.log `14: ${m.get 14 }` ;            14: undefined  All of the keys in this example so far are numbers. If you were doing this with an object instead of a  map, the keys would have been converted to strings, but that’s not true with Map:  console.log 'Look for key "4" instead of 4:' ; console.log `"4": ${m.get "4" }` ;          "4": undefined  the key is 4, not "4"  console.log 'Look for key 4:' ; console.log `4: ${m.get 4 }` ;              4: four  To update an entry’s value, use set again; it will update the existing entry:  m.set 3, "THREE" ; console.log `3: ${m.get 3 }` ;              3: THREE console.log `Entries: ${m.size}` ;          Entries: 4  still   To delete  remove  an entry, use the delete method:  m.delete 4 ;  delete returns true if an entry was deleted, false if there was no entry matching the key. Note   that delete is a method of Maps; you don’t use the delete operator. delete m[2] would try to  delete a property called "2" from the map object, but entries in the map aren’t properties of the map  object, so it wouldn’t have any effect.  To check whether an entry exists in the map, use the has method, which returns a boolean  true if  the map has an entry for the key, false if not :  console.log `Entry for 7? ${m.has 7 }` ;    Entry for 7? false console.log `Entry for 3? ${m.has 3 }` ;    Entry for 3? true  Note that, again, entries are not properties, so you don’t use the in operator or the   hasOwnProperty method.  So far, all of the keys in this example have been of the same type  number . That’s often going to be  true in real-world use, but there’s nothing requiring it; keys in a map don’t all have to be the same  type. You can add an entry with a string key to this example map we’ve been building up that so far  only has number keys in it, for instance:  m.set "testing", "one two three" ; console.log m.get "testing"  ;              one two three  Keys can be objects:  const obj1 = {}; m.set obj1, "value for obj1" ; console.log m.get obj1  ;                   value for obj1  Different objects are always different keys, even if they have the same properties. The obj1 key is a  plain object with no properties; if you add another entry using a plain object with no properties as  the key, it’s a different key:  const obj2 = {}; m.set obj2, "value for obj2" ; console.log `obj1: ${m.get obj1 }` ;       obj1: value for obj1 console.log `obj2: ${m.get obj2 }` ;       obj2: value for obj2   296  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets  Since keys can be  almost  any JavaScript value, valid keys include null, undefined, and even NaN   which famously isn’t equal to anything, not even itself :  m.set null, "value for null" ; m.set undefined, "value for undefined" ; m.set NaN, "value for NaN" ; console.log `null: ${m.get null }` ;              null: value for null console.log `undefined: ${m.get undefined }` ;    undefined: value for undefined console.log `NaN: ${m.get NaN }` ;                NaN: value for NaN  Notice that get returns undefined in two separate situations: if there was no matching entry for the  key, or if there was and its value was undefined.  Just like object properties.  If you need to tell the  difference between those situations, use has.  To clear all entries out of the map, use the clear method:  m.clear  ; console.log `Entries now: ${m.size}` ;     Entries now: 0  Key Equality  Keys in Maps can be almost any value  more on that in a moment . They’re compared using the  “SameValueZero” operation, which is the same as strict equality  ===  except that NaN is equal to  itself  which, famously, it otherwise isn’t . This means that:  ➤➤ There’s no type coercion when trying to match keys; a key is always different from a key of   another type  "1" and 1 are different keys .  ➤➤ An object is always a different key from any other object, even if they have the same   properties.  ➤➤ NaN works as a key.  The “almost” in “Keys in Maps can be almost any value” is that you can’t have a map key with the  value –0  negative zero . If you try to add an entry with the key –0, the map will use 0 as the key  instead; if you look up an entry using the key –0, get will look up the entry for 0 instead:  const key = -0; console.log key ;               -0 const m = new Map  ; m.set key, "value" ; const [keyInMap] = m.keys  ;     `keys` returns an iterator for the map's keys  console.log keyInMap ;          0 console.log `${m.get 0 }` ;     value console.log `${m.get -0 }` ;    value  This is to avoid ambiguity, since 0 and –0 are hard to distinguish from each other. They’re differ- ent values  per the IEEE-754 specification JavaScript numbers adhere to , but strictly equal to each  other  0 === -0 is true . Number’s toString returns "0" for both of them, and most  but not all   JavaScript operations treat them as being the same value. When Map and Set were being designed,  there was a lot of discussion about the two zeros  including, briefly, a flag you could use to decide  whether they were the same or different in a given Map or Set , but the value of that didn’t justify the  complexity. So to avoid making it easy to accidentally shoot yourself in the foot, Map converts –0 to 0  when you try to use it as a key.   Maps  ❘  297  Creating Maps from Iterables  Earlier, you saw that the Map constructor creates an empty map if you don’t pass it any argument.  You can also provide entries for the map by passing in an iterable of objects, typically an array of  arrays. Here’s a simple example doing that, mapping English words to Italian:  However, neither the iterable nor its entries have to be arrays: any iterable can be used, and any  object with "0" and "1" properties can be used for its entries. In effect, Map’s constructor looks some- thing like this  notionally, not exactly :  const m = new Map [     ["one", "uno"],     ["two", "due"],     ["three", "tre"] ] ; console.log m.size ;           3 console.log m.get "two"  ;     due  constructor entries  {     if  entries  {         for  const entry of entries  {             this.set entry["0"], entry["1"] ;         }     } }  Note that the entries are created in the order they’re provided by the iterable’s iterator.  If you pass more than one argument to the Map constructor, subsequent arguments are currently ignored.  You can copy a map by just passing it into the Map constructor  more on how this works in the  next section :  const m1 = new Map [     [1, "one"],     [2, "two"],     [3, "three"] ] ; const m2 = new Map m1 ; console.log m2.get 2  ;    two  Iterating the Map Contents  Maps are iterable. Their default iterator produces a [key, value] array for each entry  which is  why you can copy a map by passing it to the Map constructor . Maps also provide a keys method for  iterating the keys, and a values method for iterating the values.  When you need both the key and value, you can use the default iterator. For instance, in a for-of  loop with iterable destructuring:  const m = new Map [     ["one", "uno"],     ["two", "due"],     ["three", "tre"] ] ;   298  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets  for  const [key, value] of m  {     console.log `${key} => ${value}` ; }    one => uno    two => due    three => tre  for  const entry of m  {     console.log `${entry[0]} => ${entry[1]}` ; }    one => uno    two => due    three => tre  Of course, you don’t have to use destructuring, you could just use the array in the loop body:  The default iterator is also available via the entries method  in fact, Map.prototype.entries and  Map.prototype[Symbol.iterator] refer to the same function .  Map entries have an order: the order in which the entries were created. That’s why the two previous  examples showed the entries in the same order they appear in the array in the Map constructor call.  Updating an entry’s value does not move it in the order. However, if you delete an entry, then add  another entry with the same key, the new entry is put at the “end” of the map  since once you deleted  the old entry, it didn’t exist in the map anymore . Here are examples of those rules:  const m = new Map [     ["one", "uno"],     ["two", "due"],     ["three", "tre"] ] ;      Modify existing entry m.set "two", "due  updated " ; for  const [key, value] of m  {     console.log `${key} => ${value}` ; }    one => uno    two => due  updated     three => tre      Remove entry, then add a new one with the same key m.delete "one" ; m.set "one", "uno  new " ; for  const [key, value] of m  {     console.log `${key} => ${value}` ; }    two => due  updated     three => tre    one => uno  new   The order applies to all of the Map’s iterables  entries, keys, and values :  const m = new Map [     ["one", "uno"],     ["two", "due"],     ["three", "tre"] ] ;   Maps  ❘  299  for  const key of m.keys    {     console.log key ; }    one    two    three   for  const value of m.values    {     console.log value ; }    uno    due    tre  const m = new Map [     ["one", "uno"],     ["two", "due"],     ["three", "tre"] ] ; m.forEach  value, key  => {     console.log `${key} => ${value}` ; } ;    one => uno    two => due    three => tre  You can also loop through the entries in a map using its forEach method, which is exactly like the  one provided by arrays:  Like the one for arrays, you can pass a second argument if you want to control what this in the call- back is, and the callback receives three arguments: the value being visited, its key, and the map you’re  looping through.  Only key and value are used in the example.   Subclassing Map  Like other built-ins, Map can be subclassed. For instance, the built-in Map class doesn’t have a filter  function like array’s filter. Suppose you have maps in your code that you commonly want to filter.  While you could add your own filter to Map.prototype, extending built-in prototypes can be  problematic  particularly in library code rather than application page code . Instead, you can use a  subclass. For instance, Listing 12-1 creates MyMap with a filter function.  LISTING 12-1:  Subclassing Map—subclassing-map.js  class MyMap extends Map {     filter predicate, thisArg  {         const newMap = new  this.constructor[Symbol.species]  MyMap   ;         for  const [key, value] of this  {             if  predicate.call thisArg, key, value, this   {                 newMap.set key, value ;             }         }         return newMap;     } }     300 ❘ CHAPTER 12    MAPS AND SETS        Usage:   const m1 = new MyMap [       ["one", "uno"],       ["two", "due"],       ["three", "tre"]   ] ;     const m2 = m1.filter key => key.includes "t"  ;   for  const [key, value] of m2  {       console.log `${key} => ${value}` ;     }        two => due        three => tre     console.log `m2 instanceof MyMap? ${m2 instanceof MyMap}` ;      m2 instanceof MyMap? true          Note the use of  Symbol.species  that you learned in Chapter   4  . The  Map  constructor has a  Symbol.species  getter that returns this . MyMap  doesn ’ t override that default, so its filter  creates a  MyMap  instance while allowing further subclasses  for instance, MySpecialMap   to control whether  filter  should create an instance of that subclass, a MyMap , or a  Map   or something else, though that seems unlikely .      Performance   The implementation of Map is naturally up to the specific JavaScript engine, but the specification requires that they are implemented “. . . using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on aver- age, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection.” This means that, for instance, adding an entry should be faster on average than searching through an array to see whether it contains the entry and then adding it if it doesn ’ t. In code, that means this:      map.set key, value ;    is required to be faster, on average, than this:  const entry = array.find e => e.key === key ; if  entry  {     entry.value = value; } else {     array.push {key, value} ; }         SETS   Sets are collections of unique values. Everything you learned about Map keys in the last section applies  to the values in a Set. A Set can hold any value except  -0 , which is converted to  0  if you add it  just like  Map keys . Values are compared using the SameValueZero operation  just like Map keys . The order  of values in a Set is the order in which they were added to the set; adding the same value again doesn ’ t  change its position  removing a value, then adding it again later, does . When you add a value to a Set,  the Set first checks to see whether it already holds the value, and only adds it if it doesn ’ t.   Prior to Set, objects were sometimes used for this purpose  storing the values as property names con- verted to strings, with any value , but that has the same sorts of disadvantages that using objects for   Sets ❘ 301  Maps has. Alternatively, arrays or array-like objects have often been used in place of sets, searching  the array before adding to it to see if it already contains the value being added.  jQuery, for instance,  is normally set-based: a jQuery instance is array-like, but adding the same DOM element to a jQuery instance doesn ’ t add it the second time.  If you were implementing a jQuery-like library in ES2015+, you might consider having it use a Set internally. You might even make it a Set subclass, as long as  you ’ re okay with it potentially containing things other than DOM elements, thanks to the Liskov Substitution Principle.  jQuery does allow that, though it ’ s not well-known.     Basic Set Operations   Let ’ s quickly run through the basics of Sets: creating, adding, accessing, and removing entries.  You  can run all of the code in this section using the basic-set-operations.js  file from the downloads.    To create a set, use the constructor  more on this later in this chapter :      const s = new Set  ;      To add entries, use the  add  method:      s.add "two" ;     s.add "four" ;        The  add  method only accepts a single value. Passing it more than one value won ’ t add the subsequent  ones. But it returns the Set, so multiple add  calls can be chained together:      s.add "one" .add "three" ;        To check if the Set has a given value in it, use the  has  method:      console.log `Has "two"? ${s.has "two" }` ;        Has "two"? true        Set entries aren ’ t properties, so you wouldn ’ t use the in  operator or  hasOwnProperty  method.    To get the number of entries in the Set, use the  size  property:      console.log `Entries: ${s.size}` ;                Entries: 4      Sets, by their nature, never contain the same value twice. If you try to add a value that ’ s already pre- sent, it isn ’ t added again:      s.add "one" .add "three" ;     console.log `Entries: ${s.size}` ;                Entries: 4  still       To delete  remove  an entry from the Set, use the  delete  method:      s.delete "two" ;     console.log `Has "two"? ${s.has "two" }` ;        Has "two"? false        To clear the Set entirely, use the clear  method:      s.clear  ;   console.log `Entries: ${s.size}` ;                Entries: 0      While the example values in this section were strings, again, the values in a Set can be almost any JavaScript value  just not negative zero, as with Map keys , and they don ’ t need to all be of the same type.     302  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets  Creating Sets from Iterables  The Set constructor accepts an iterable and fills the set with the values from the iterable  in order  if  you provide one:  const s = new Set ["one", "two", "three"] ; console.log s.has "two"  ;    true  Naturally, if the iterable returns the same value twice, the resulting Set has it only once:  const s = new Set ["one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "three"] ; console.log s.size ;    3  Iterating the Set Contents  Sets are iterable; the order of iteration is the order in which the values were added to the set:  Adding a value that’s already in the set doesn’t change its position in the set; removing it entirely and  then adding it back later does  since by the time you add it back, it’s not in the set anymore :  const s = new Set ["one", "two", "three"] ; for  const value of s  {     console.log value ; }    one    two    three  const s = new Set ["one", "two", "three"] ; for  const value of s  {     console.log value ; } s.add "one" ;    Again for  const value of s  {     console.log value ; }    one    two    three   s.delete "one" ; s.add "one" ; for  const value of s  {     console.log value ; }    two    three    one  Since Sets can be constructed from iterables, and Sets are iterables, you can copy a Set by passing it  into the Set constructor:  const s1 = new Set ["a", "b", "c"] ; const s2 = new Set s1 ; console.log s2.has "b"  ;    true s1.delete "b" ; console.log s2.has "b"  ;    true  still, removing from s1 doesn't remove from s2    Sets  ❘  303  Using Set’s iterability is also a handy way to copy an array while removing any duplicate entries in it   the classic unique function so many programmers have in their toolkits :  const a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]; const a2 = Array.from new Set a1  ; console.log a2.length ;        4 console.log a2.join ", "  ;    1, 2, 3, 4  That said, if you want only unique values, you may have been able to use a Set in the first place  rather than an array.  The default iterator of a Set iterates its values. That same iterator is also accessible via the values  method. To make the Map and Set interfaces similar, that same iterator is also available via the   keys method. In fact, Set.prototype[Symbol.iterator], Set.prototype.values, and   Set.prototype.keys all refer to the same function. Sets also provide an entries method that returns  two-entry arrays  like Map’s entries  where both of the entries contain the value from the Set, almost  as though a Set were a Map where the keys map to themselves:  const s = new Set ["a", "b", "c"] ; for  const value of s  {    or `of s.values  `     console.log value ; }    a    b    c for  const key of s.keys    {     console.log key ; }    a    b    c for  const [key, value] of s.entries    {     console.log `${key} => ${value}` ; }    a => a    b => b    c => c  Subclassing Set  Set is easy to subclass. For instance, suppose you wanted an addAll method that adds all the values  from an iterable to the set, rather than having to call add repeatedly, but you didn’t want to add it to  Set.prototype since you were writing library code. Listing 12-2 has a simple Set subclass with the  added method.  LISTING 12-2:  Subclassing Set—subclassing-set.js  class MySet extends Set {     addAll iterable  {         for  const value of iterable  {             this.add value ;         }         return this;   304  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets      } }      Usage const s = new MySet  ; s.addAll ["a", "b", "c"] ; s.addAll [1, 2, 3] ; for  const value of s  {     console.log value ; }    a    b    c    1    2    3  As with Map, if you were going to add a method that produced a new set, you might want to use  the species pattern to create the new instance.  Performance  As with Map, the implementation of Set is up to the specific JavaScript engine, but as with Map the  specification requires that they are implemented “. . . using either hash tables or other mechanisms  that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collec- tion.” So this:  set.add value ;  is required to be faster, on average, than this:  if  !array.includes value   {     array.push value ; }  WEAKMAPS  WeakMaps let you store a value related to an object  the key  without forcing the key to remain in  memory; the key is weakly held by the map. If the map would be the only reason the object is kept  in memory, its entry  key and value  is automatically removed from the map, leaving the key object  eligible for garbage-collection.  The value of the entry, if it’s an object, is held normally by the map as  long as the entry exists. Only the key is held weakly.  This is true even if the same object is used as a  key in more than one WeakMap  or if it’s held in a WeakSet, as you’ll learn in the next section . Once  the only remaining references to the key object are in WeakMaps  or WeakSets , the JavaScript engine  removes the entries for that object and makes the object available for garbage collection.  For instance, if you wanted to store information related to a DOM element without storing it in a  property on the element itself, you could store it in a WeakMap using the DOM element as the key    WeakMaps  ❘  305  and the information you want to store as the value. If the DOM element is removed from the DOM  and nothing else refers to it, the entry for that element is automatically removed from the map and  the DOM element’s memory can be reclaimed  along with any memory allocated for the map entry’s  value, provided nothing else refers to that value separately from the map .  WeakMaps Are Not Iterable  One significant aspect of WeakMaps is that if you don’t already have a particular key, you can’t get  it from the map. This is because an implementation might have a delay between when the key isn’t  reachable by other means and when the entry is removed from the map; if you could get the key from  the map during that time, it would introduce indeterminacy to the code doing it. So WeakMaps don’t  offer any way to get a key if you don’t already have it.  That has a significant impact on WeakMap: it’s not iterable. In fact, WeakMap provides very little  information about its contents. Here’s what it provides:  ➤➤ has: If you give it a key, it will tell you whether it has an entry for that key. ➤➤ get: If you give it a key, it will give you the value for the key’s entry in the WeakMap  or   undefined if it doesn’t have a matching entry, like Map does .  ➤➤ delete: If you give it a key, it will delete that key’s entry  if any  and return a flag: true if   the entry was found and deleted, false if it wasn’t found.  There’s no size, no forEach, no keys iterator, no values iterator, etc. WeakMap is not a subclass of  Map, although the common parts of their API intentionally mirror each other.  Use Cases and Examples  Let’s explore a couple of use cases for WeakMaps.  Use Case: Private Information  One classic use case for WeakMaps is private information. Consider Listing 12-3.  LISTING 12-3:  Using WeakMap for private information—private-info.js  const Example =     => {     const privateMap = new WeakMap  ;       return class Example {         constructor   {             privateMap.set this, 0 ;         }           incrementCounter   {             const result = privateMap.get this  + 1;             privateMap.set this, result ;             return result;         }     306  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets          showCounter   {             console.log `Counter is ${privateMap.get this }` ;         }     }; }   ;   const e1 = new Example  ; e1.incrementCounter  ; console.log e1 ;             some representation of the object    const e2 = new Example  ; e2.incrementCounter  ; e2.incrementCounter  ; e2.incrementCounter  ;   e1.showCounter  ;           Counter is 1 e2.showCounter  ;           Counter is 3  The implementation of Example is wrapped in an inline-invoked function expression  IIFE  so that  privateMap is entirely private to just the class’s implementation.  PRIVATE CLASS FIELDS  In Chapter 18 you’ll learn about the proposed private class fields, which will be in  ES2021 and provide a way for a class to have truly private information  both  instance-specific and static . That could be used here in two ways: you could simply  use a private field for the counter instead of using a WeakMap, or if you had reason  for using the WeakMap  perhaps not all instances need private information , you  could make the map itself a static private field  which would simplify the implemen- tation by doing away with the IIFE wrapper .  When you create an instance via the Example constructor, it saves an entry in a WeakMap    privateMap  with the value 0, keyed by the new object  this . When you call incrementCounter,  it updates that entry by incrementing its value, and when you call showCounter, it shows the current  value. To see it in action, it’s probably best to run it in an environment with a debugger or an interac- tive console. Be sure to dig into the object logged on the “ some representation of the object ” line.  If you do, you won’t find the counter value anywhere, even though the object can access and even  change the counter value. The counter value is truly private to the code within the scoping function  wrapped around the Example class; no other code can access that information, because no other code  has access to privateMap.  Question: what would happen if you used a Map for this instead of a WeakMap?  Right! Over time the Map would just get bigger and bigger and bigger as Example objects kept get- ting created and never cleaned up, even when all other code was done with them, because the Map  would keep them in memory. But with a WeakMap, when all other code is done with an Example  object and drops its reference to it, the JavaScript engine removes the WeakMap entry for that object.   WeakMaps  ❘  307  Use Case: Storing Information for Objects Outside Your Control  Another major use case for WeakMaps is storing information for objects that are outside your con- trol. Suppose you’re dealing with an API that provides objects to you, and you need to keep track of  your own information related to those objects. Adding properties to those objects is usually a bad  idea  and the API may even make it impossible by giving you a proxy or a frozen object .  WeakMap to the rescue! Just store the information keyed by the object. Since the WeakMap holds the  key weakly, it doesn’t prevent the API object being garbage-collected.  Listings 12-4 and 12-5 show an example, tracking information about DOM elements by using the  DOM elements as keys in a WeakMap.

Suppose that person object had    WeakMaps  ❘  309  referred back to the DOM element? For instance, if the for-of loop in init replaced the personDiv  constant with a property on the person object, like this:  for  const person of people  {     const person.div = createPersonElement person ;     personMap.set person.div, person ;     peopleList.appendChild person.div ; }  Now, the WeakMap’s entry key is person.div and its value is person, meaning that the value  person   has a reference back to the key  person.div . Would the existence of the person object’s reference to  the key keep the key in memory, even if only the person object  and personMap  referred to the key?  You probably guessed: no, it wouldn’t. The spec’s language on this is one of its easier-to-read  parts. It says:2  If an object that is being used as the key of a WeakMap key value pair is only reach- able by following a chain of references that start within that WeakMap, then that  key value pair is inaccessible and is automatically removed from the WeakMap.  Let’s prove that. See Listing 12-6.  LISTING 12-6:  Value referring back to key—value-referring-to-key.js  function log msg  {     const p = document.createElement "pre" ;     p.appendChild document.createTextNode msg  ;     document.body.appendChild p ; }   const AAAAExample =     => {     const privateMap = new WeakMap  ;       return class AAAAExample {         constructor secret, limit  {             privateMap.set this, {counter: 0, owner: this} ;         }           get counter   {             return privateMap.get this .counter;         }           incrementCounter   {             return ++privateMap.get this .counter;         }     }; }   ;   const e = new AAAAExample  ;  let a = []; document.getElementById "btn-create" .addEventListener "click", function e  {     const count = +document.getElementById "objects" .value  100000;     log `Generating ${count} objects...` ;     for  let n = count; n > 0; --n  {  2 https:  tc39.github.io ecma262 sec-weakmap-objects   310  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets          a.push new AAAAExample   ;     }     log `Done, ${a.length} objects in the array` ; } ; document.getElementById "btn-release" .addEventListener "click", function e  {     a.length = 0;     log "All objects released" ; } ;  The code creates an AAAAExample object that it references in e and never releases.

FIGURE 12-5   This demonstrates that even though the value objects refer back  to their key objects, they don’t prevent cleanup of those entries. In fact, the value object of one entry  could refer to the key object of another entry whose value refers to the key object of the first entry   a circular reference , or some other entry; but once nothing outside of any WeakMap refers to those  key objects anymore, the JavaScript engine removes the entries and makes the objects available for  garbage collection.   WeakMaps  ❘  313  FIGURE 12-6   FIGURE 12-7    314  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets  WEAKSETS  WeakSets are the Set equivalent of WeakMaps: sets of objects where being in the set doesn’t prevent  cleanup of the object. You can think of a WeakSet as a WeakMap where the key is the value in the  set and the value is  conceptually  true—meaning, “yes, the object is in the set.” Or if you think of  Sets as Maps where the key and value are the same thing  as Set’s entries iterator kind of suggests ,  that’s fine too, although WeakSet doesn’t have an entries iterator.  WeakSets aren’t iterable, for the same reason WeakMaps aren’t. They only provide:  ➤➤ add: Add an object to the set. ➤➤ has: Check if the object is in the set. ➤➤ delete: Delete  remove  the object from the set.  Consequently, WeakSet isn’t a subclass of Set, but as with WeakMap and Map, the common parts of  their API are intentionally aligned.  So what’s the point of WeakSet? If you can’t access the objects in it unless you already have those  objects, then what purpose does it serve?  The answer is the analogy in the first paragraph of this section: you can check to see if an object you  have is in the set. This is useful for checking that you’ve previously seen an object in a specific part of  your code  the code where you added it to the set . Let’s see a couple of examples of this general use case.  Use Case: Tracking  Suppose that before “using” an object, you need to know whether that object has ever been “used” in  the past, but without storing that as a flag on the object  perhaps because if it’s a flag on the object,  other code can see it; or because it’s not your object . For instance, this might be some kind of single- use access token. A WeakSet is a simple way to do that without forcing the object to stay in memory.  See Listing 12-7.  LISTING 12-7:  Single-use object—single-use-object.js  const SingleUseObject =     => {     const used = new WeakSet  ;       return class SingleUseObject {         constructor name  {             this.name = name;         }         use   {             if  used.has this   {                 throw new Error `${this.name} has already been used` ;             }             console.log `Using ${this.name}` ;             used.add this ;         }     }; }   ;     WeakSets  ❘  315  const suo1 = new SingleUseObject "suo1" ; const suo2 = new SingleUseObject "suo2" ; suo1.use  ;                                  Using suo1 try {     suo1.use  ; } catch  e  {     console.error "Error: " + e.message ;    Error: suo1 has already been used } suo2.use  ;                                  Using suo2  Use Case: Branding  Branding is another form of tracking: suppose you’re designing a library that provides objects, and  later accepts those objects back to do something with them. If the library needs to be absolutely cer- tain that the object it got back originated from the library code, that it hasn’t been faked by the code  using the library, it can use a WeakSet for that. See Listing 12-8.  LISTING 12-8:  Only accept known objects—only-accept-known-objects.js  const Thingy =     => {     const known = new WeakSet  ;     let nextId = 1;       return class Thingy {         constructor name  {             this.name = name;             this.id = nextId++;             Object.freeze this ;             known.add this ;         }           action   {             if  !known.has this   {                 throw new Error "Unknown Thingy" ;             }                Code here knows that this object was created                by this class             console.log `Action on Thingy ${this.id}  ${this.name} ` ;         }     } }   ;      In other code using it:      Using real ones const t1 = new Thingy "t1" ; t1.action  ;    Action on Thingy 1  t1  const t2 = new Thingy "t2" ; t2.action  ;    Action on Thingy 2  t2       Trying to use a fake one const faket2 = Object.create Thingy.prototype ;   316  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets  faket2.name = "faket2"; faket2.id = 2; Object.freeze faket2 ; faket2.action  ;    Error: Unknown Thingy  The Thingy class creates objects with id and name properties, and then freezes those objects so they  cannot be changed in any way: their properties are read-only and can’t be reconfigured, properties  can’t be added or removed, and the prototype can’t be changed.  Later, if code tries to use the action method on a Thingy object, action checks that the object it was  called on is a genuine Thingy object by looking in the known set. If it wasn’t, it refuses to perform  its action. Since the set is a WeakSet, this doesn’t prevent the Thingy objects from being garbage- collected.  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Here are some old habits you might consider updating to new ones.  Use Maps Instead of Objects for General-Purpose Maps  Old habit: Using objects as general-purpose maps:  const byId = Object.create null ;    So it has no prototype for  const entry of entries  {     byId[entry.id] = entry; }    Later const entry = byId[someId];  Maps are better suited to general purpose mapping, and don’t force the keys to be strings if they  aren’t already strings.  New habit: Use a Map instead:  const byId = new Map  ; for  const entry of entries  {     byId.set entry.id, entry ; }      Later const entry = byId.get someId ;  Use Sets Instead of Objects for Sets  Old habit: Using objects as pseudo-sets:  const used = Object.create null ;    Marking something as "used" used[thing.id] = true;    Check later if something was used if  used[thing.id]  {        ... }   Old Habits to New  ❘  317  New habit: Use a Set instead:  const used = new Set  ;    Marking something as "used" used.add thing.id ;             Or possibly just use `thing` directly    Check later if something was used if  used.has thing.id   {       Or possibly just use `thing` directly        ... }  Or if appropriate, a WeakSet:  const used = new WeakSet  ;    Marking something as "used" used.add thing ;    Check later if something was used if  used.has thing   {        ... }  Use WeakMaps for Storing Private Data Instead of  Public Properties  Old habit:  See caveats in the “new habit” section.  Using a naming convention, such as an under- score  _  prefix, to indicate that a property on an object is private and shouldn’t be used by  “other” code:  New habit:  See caveats after the example.  Use a WeakMap instead, so the data is truly private  but  see caveat following the code :  class Example {     constructor name  {         this.name = name;         this._counter = 0;     }     get counter   {         return this._counter;     }     incrementCounter   {         return ++this._counter;     } }  const Example =     => {     const counters = new WeakMap  ;       return class Example {         constructor name  {             this.name = name;             counters.set this, 0 ;         }         get counter   {             return counters.get this ;         }         incrementCounter   {             const result = counters.get this  + 1;   318  ❘  CHAPTER 12    Maps and sets              counters.set this, result ;             return result;         }     } }   ;  Two caveats on this new habit, though:  ➤➤ Using a WeakMap for this increases the code complexity; in any given situation, the pri- vacy gain may or may not be worth the complexity cost. Many languages have “private”  properties but then make it possible to access those properties anyway; for instance, Java’s  private fields can be accessed via reflection. So just using a naming convention isn’t really all  that much worse than using Java’s private properties  although accessing them is definitely  easier than using Java’s reflection to do so .  ➤➤ Before too much longer, class syntax  at least  will provide a means of having private fields   without using a WeakMap, as you’ll learn in Chapter 18. Jumping on the habit of using a  WeakMap for private data now may just set you up for refactoring later.  It’ll be a case-by-case basis. Some information really needs to be properly private  from code; remem- ber, nothing is private from debuggers . Other information is probably fine if you just mark it with a  convention that says “Don’t use this.”   Modules  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ Modules introduction  ➤➤ import and export  ➤➤ How modules are loaded  ➤➤ Dynamic import: import    ➤➤ Tree shaking  ➤➤ Bundlers  ➤➤ import.meta  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode   or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter, you’ll learn about ES2015’s modules, which make it easy to divide your code  into small, maintainable pieces and bring them together as needed.  INTRODUCTION TO MODULES  For years, JavaScript programmers either just put their code into the global namespace, or   since the global namespace is crowded  wrapped their code in a wrapper function  a scoping  function . Sometimes they’d have that scoping function return an object  sometimes called a  namespace object  they assigned to a single global variable  the “revealing module pattern” .    320  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  In projects of any size, programmers would run into issues with name conflicts, complex dependen‑ cies, and splitting the code into appropriately sized files. Those issues led to various different—and  incompatible—solutions for defining and combining modules of code, such as CommonJS  CJS ,  Asynchronous Module Definition  AMD , and variations of them. Multiple incompatible standards  make life difficult for programmers, tool builders, library authors, and anyone trying to use modules  from different sources.  Thankfully, ES2015 standardized modules for JavaScript, providing mostly common syntax and  semantics for tools and authors to use.  We’ll get to that “mostly” in a moment.  Adding to the   earlier list of acronyms, native modules are often called ESM modules  ESM = ECMAScript Module ,  differentiating them from CJS modules, AMD modules, or other types.  MODULE FUNDAMENTALS  This section provides a quick overview of modules, which later sections build on providing  more details.  A module is a unit of code in its own “compilation unit”  loosely, “file” . It has its own scope  instead  of running its code at global scope like scripts do . It can load other modules, including importing  things  such as functions and variables  from those other modules. It can export things for other mod‑ ules to import. A group of modules importing each other’s exports form a graph, commonly called a  module tree. See Figure 13‑1.  uses  Module A  u  s  e  s  Module B  uses  Module C  FIGURE 13-1   When importing, you say what module you’re importing from using a module specifier, which is a  string saying where to find the module. The JavaScript engine works with the host environment to  load the module you specify. The JavaScript engine loads a module only once per realm;1 if multiple  other modules use it, they all use the same copy of it. A module can have named exports and or a  single default export.  1  You may remember from Chapter 5  that a realm is the overall container in which a bit of code lives: its global environ‑ ment, the intrinsic objects for that environment  Array, Object, Date, etc. , all the code loaded into that environ‑ ment, and other bits of state and such. A browser window  whether it’s a tab or full window or iframe  is a realm. A  web worker is a realm, separate from the realm of the window that created it.   Module Fundamentals  ❘  321  To export something from a module, you use an export declaration, which starts with the export  keyword. Here are examples of two named exports:  export function example   {        ... } export let answer = 42;  To load a module and  optionally  import something from it, you use either an import declaration or  a dynamic import. You’ll learn about dynamic imports later in this chapter; for now, let’s just look  at import declarations  also called static imports . They use the import keyword followed by the  thing s  you want to import, then the word “from” followed by a module specifier string literal saying  what module to import from, like this:  The curly braces in those declarations show that they import named exports.  You’ll learn the details  in a moment.   import { example } from ". mod.js"; import { answer } from ". mod.js";    or import { example, answer } from ". mod.js";  Here’s a default export  note the word default :  export default function example   {        ... }  A module can only have one default export  or none . You can import it like this  note that there  aren’t any curly braces; again, you’ll learn the details in a moment :  You can also import a module just for its side effects, by simply not listing anything to import from it:  import example from ". mod.js";  import ". mod.js";  That loads the module  and the modules it depends on  and runs its code, but doesn’t import any‑ thing from it.  Those are the most common forms of export and import. You’ll learn some further variations and  details later in this chapter.  Only code in modules can use these declarative forms of export and import; non‑module code can't.  Non‑module code can use the dynamic import you'll learn about later, but can’t export anything.  import and export declarations can only appear in the top‑level scope of a module; they cannot be  inside any control‑flow structure like a loop or if statement:  if  a < b  {     import example from ". mod.js";    SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier     example  ; }  A module can only export things it declares or re‑export things it imports. A module can’t export  a global variable, for instance, because it didn’t declare it. A module can’t declare a global variable,    322  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  because module code doesn’t run at global scope.  It can add a property to the global object via  assignment, for instance window.varName = 42 on browsers, or using the globalThis you’ll learn  about in Chapter 17, but that’s not a declaration.   Winding up that whirlwind overview: importing an export creates a read‑only “live” indirect binding  to the exported item. That binding is read‑only: a module can read the value of an item it imports,  including seeing a new value if the original module changes the item’s value, but cannot change the  value directly.  Whew! Let’s look at those various things more closely.  The Module Specifier  In the preceding examples, the ". mod.js" part is the module specifier:  import { example } from ". mod.js";  With an import declaration, the module specifier must be a string literal, not just an expression result‑ ing in a string, since declarations are static forms  the JavaScript engine and the environment must be  able to interpret them without running the code . Either single or double quotes may be used. Aside  from that, the JavaScript specification says almost nothing about module specifiers. It leaves the form  and semantics of module specifier strings to host environments.  This is the reason for the “mostly” in  “. . . mostly common syntax and semantics . . .” in the introduction.  The form and semantics of mod‑ ule specifiers for the web are defined by the HTML specification; the ones for Node.js are defined  by Node.js; and so on. That said, the teams handling specifiers for major environments like those are  conscious that modules are being created for use across environments and are trying to avoid unnec‑ essary differences. For now, don’t worry about module specifiers, you’ll learn more about them in  “Using Modules in Browsers” and “Using Modules in Node.js” later in this chapter.  Basic Named Exports  You’ve already seen a couple of basic named exports. In this section you’ll learn more about them.  You can use a named export to export anything declared within the module that has a name—vari‑ ables, constants, functions, class constructors, and things imported from other modules. There are a  couple of different ways to do it. One way is to simply put the export keyword in front of what you  want to export when you declare or define it:  export let answer = 42; export var question = "Life, the Universe, and Everything"; export const author = "Douglas Adams"; export function fn   {        ... } export class Example {        ... }  That code creates five named exports: answer, question, author, fn, and Example. Notice how each  of those statements declarations is exactly the way it would have been without being exported, just  with export tacked on the front. The function declaration and class declaration are both still declara‑ tions, not expressions  and so don’t have semicolons after them .   Module Fundamentals  ❘  323  Other modules use those names to say what they want to import from the module. For example:  import { answer, question } from ". mod.js";  In that example, the module only needs the answer and question exports, so it only asks for those  and not author, fn, or Example.  You’ll remember from the introduction that the curly braces are what indicate you’re importing  named exports, not the default export. Although those curly braces make that part of the import  look a bit like object destructuring  Chapter 7 , it isn’t destructuring. Import syntax is entirely sepa‑ rate from destructuring. It doesn’t allow nesting, handles renaming differently from destructuring, and  doesn’t allow default values. They’re different things with superficially similar syntax.  You don’t have to export something in the same place you create it; you can use a separate export declara‑ tion instead. Here’s the same module as earlier, using a single export declaration  in this case, at the end :  although the primary use case of a separate declaration is for coding styles that group all exports  together in one place.  Export declarations can be at the end, at the beginning, or anywhere in between; here’s an example of  putting a single declaration at the beginning:  let answer = 42; var question = "Life, the Universe, and Everything"; const author = "Douglas Adams"; function fn   {        ... } class Example {        ... } export { answer, question, author, fn, Example };  You can have multiple separate declarations, like this:  export { answer }; export { question, author, fn, Example };  export { answer, question, author, fn, Example }; let answer = 42; const question = "Life, the Universe, and Everything"; const author = "Douglas Adams"; function fn   {        ... } class Example {        ... }  The styles can be intermixed, though it’s probably not best practice:  export let answer = 42; const question = "Life, the Universe, and Everything"; const author = "Douglas Adams";   324  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  export function fn   {        ... } class Example {        ... } export { question, author, Example };  The only real restriction is that the names of your exports must be unique; you can’t export answer  in the previous example twice using the name answer for both, or try to export a variable named  answer and also a function named answer. That said, it is possible  if unusual  to export the same  thing twice, either by renaming one of the exports  more on that in a later section  or exporting   something both as a named export and the default export. For instance, you might export a function  under its primary name and also under an alias.  Which you use—inline, declaration at the end, declaration at the beginning, or some combination—is  entirely a matter of style. As usual, it’s probably best to be consistent within a codebase.  Default Export  Aside from named exports, a module can also optionally have a single default export. A default  export is just like a named export using the name default, but it has its own dedicated syntax  and  doesn’t create a local binding called default . You set the default export by adding the keyword  default after export:  export default function example   {        ... }  import x from ". mod.js";  Another module imports it by using any name the author likes, without curly braces around it:  If what you’re exporting has a name, that name isn’t used in the export, since this form exports the  default. For instance, with the preceding export of a function called example, other code can import  it this way:  import example from ". mod.js";    or import ex from ". mod.js";    The name of the import doesn't have to be "example"  but not like this, because it’s not a named export:     WRONG  for importing a default export  import { example } from ". mod.js";  More than one export default in a module is an error; a module can only have one default export.  You can declare something and then export it as the default separately:  function example   { } export default example;  export default 6 * 7;  There’s a second form of default export that lets you export the result of any arbitrary expression:   Module Fundamentals  ❘  325  EXPORTING AN ANONYMOUS FUNCTION OR CLASS DECLARATION  It’s almost just a curiosity, but note that this:     export default function   {  *...*  }  is an exported function declaration, not a function expression. A default export is the  only place you can have a function declaration without a name; the resulting func‑ tion will have the name default. Since it’s a function declaration, it’s hoisted like all  other function declarations  the function is created before the step‑by‑step execution  of the module begins , although that’s rarely important.  You can also have an anonymous class declaration, again only when doing a  default export:     export default class {  *...*  }  But since it’s a class declaration, the class isn’t created until execution of the code  reaches the declaration; it’s in the TDZ until then.  More on how the TDZ applies to  modules later in this chapter.   This form of default export is exactly like a let export, just without an identifier that the module  code could use to access it. If you could call a variable *default*, then  export default 6 * 7;  would be the same as     Conceptual, not valid syntax let *default* = 6 * 7; export default *default*;  but with *default* not being accessible to the module’s code.  You’ll learn why I used *default*  later when we talk about bindings.   Even though technically the specification has this arbitrary expression export create the equivalent of  a let variable  not a const , there’s no way for code to change its value, so it’s effectively constant.  Since this form evaluates an expression, just like a let export it doesn’t have a value until the export  declaration is reached in the step‑by‑step execution of the code. Until then, it’s in the TDZ.  Using Modules in Browsers  In a web page application, you typically use a single entry point module to start loading the module  tree  although it’s possible to have more than one . The entry point module imports from other mod‑ ules  which may in turn import from other modules, and so on . To tell the browser that a script  element’s code is a module, you use type="module":       326  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  Let’s look at a simple browser‑based example; see Listings 13‑1, 13‑2, and 13‑3. You can run this  example using the files from the downloads in any modern browser.  LISTING 13-1:  A simple module example  HTML —simple.html           Simple Module Example              LISTING 13-2:  A simple module example  entry point module —simple.js  import { log } from ". log.js";   log "Hello, modules!" ;  LISTING 13-3:  A simple module example  log module —log.js  export function log msg  {     const p = document.createElement "pre" ;     p.appendChild document.createTextNode msg  ;     document.body.appendChild p ; }  When you load simple.html in the browser, the browser and JavaScript engine work together to  load the simple.js module, detect its dependency on log.js, load and run log.js, and then run  simple.js’s code—which uses the log function from log.js to log a message.  Note that log.js isn’t listed anywhere in the HTML. The fact that simple.js depends on it is   indicated by the import statement. You could add a script tag for log.js before the one for   simple.js if you liked, perhaps to start the process of loading it earlier, but normally there’s no need.   If you did, log.js would still only be loaded once.   Module Scripts Don’t Delay Parsing  A script tag with type="module" doesn’t hold up the parsing of the HTML while the script is  fetched and executed like a non‑module script tag does. Instead, the module and its dependencies  are loaded in parallel with the parsing; then the module’s code is run when the parsing is complete  or  when it finishes loading, whichever happens last .  If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s how a script tag with the defer attribute is handled. In effect,  script type="module" tags implicitly have defer on them.  Specifying it explicitly has no effect.    Module Fundamentals  ❘  327  There is one difference though: the defer attribute only defers scripts that load their content from an  external resource via the src attribute, not script tags with inline content. But type="module" defers  scripts with inline content, too.  Notice that although the module’s code isn’t run until the HTML parsing is complete, the browser  and JavaScript engine do work together to determine the module’s dependencies  from its import  declarations  and fetch any modules it depends on in parallel with the HTML parsing. The module’s  code doesn’t have to run for its dependencies to be loaded, since modules are statically analyzable.  As with non‑module script tags, you can include the async attribute to make the browser run the  module’s code as soon as it’s ready to be run, even if the HTML parsing isn’t complete yet. You can  see how different script tags are processed in Figure 13‑2, which is inspired by the diagram in the  WHAT‑WG HTML specification in the section describing the async and defer attributes.2  Scripting: HTML Parser: Scripting: HTML Parser: Scripting: HTML Parser: Scripting: HTML Parser: Scripting: HTML Parser:                 FIGURE 13-2   The nomodule Attribute  parser  fetch  execution  runtime →  If you want to serve modules to browsers that support them but serve non‑module scripts to brows‑ ers that don’t  like Internet Explorer , you can use the nomodule attribute on the non‑module scripts,  like this:         Unfortunately, Internet Explorer will download both files, even though it will only run the script.js  file. Safari did that for several versions as well, as did Edge  even once it added module support , but  both are fixed now.  To work around that, you can identify the module script to load using inline code instead:    import ". module.js";     document.write '  ' ;     If you don’t care for document.write—and many don’t—you could always use createElement and  appendChild.   2 https:  html.spec.whatwg.org multipage scripting.htmlattr-script-defer   328  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  Module Specifiers on the Web  As of this writing, the HTML specification defines module specifiers quite narrowly so that they can be  enhanced over time: module specifiers are either absolute URLs, or relative URLs starting with    a slash,  or “solidus” as the spec calls it , .   dot slash , or ..   dot dot slash . Like URLs in CSS files, relative URLs  are resolved relative to the resource the import declaration is in, not the base document. The module is  identified by its resolved URL  so different relative paths to the module all resolve to the same module .  The specifiers in the following imports are all valid:  import  *...*  "http:  example.com a.js";    Absolute URL import  *...*  " a.js";                      Starts with   import  *...*  '. b.js';                     Starts with .  import  *...*  ".. c.js";                    Starts with ..  import  *...*  '. modules d.js';             Starts with .   The specifiers in the following imports are invalid in browsers at present because they aren’t absolute  and don’t start with  , . , or ..   but that’s changing, more below :  import  *...*  "fs"; import  *...*  "f.js";  For a module that’s in the same location as the module importing it, the .  prefix is required rather  than just a bare name  ". mod.js", not just "mod.js" . This is so the meaning of a bare name like  "mod.js" or "mod" can be defined at a later date. One current proposal, import maps,3 allows the  page to define a map of module specifiers to URLs, so that the contents of the modules could use bare  names while allowing the containing page flexibility in terms of where those modules are actually  located. That proposal is still in flux, but seems likely to progress.  The specifier must include the file extension if you use one on your files; there’s no default extension  or extensions. The extension you use is up to you, just as with non‑module scripts. Many program‑ mers stick with .js. However, some are choosing .mjs instead to flag up the fact that the file con‑ tains a module, not just a script. If you do that, be sure to configure your web server to serve the file  with the correct MIME type, text javascript, because modules don’t have their own MIME type.  For what it’s worth, my view is that modules are the new normal, and so I’m sticking with .js.  Aside from the next section on Node.js, the specifiers shown in this chapter are all as defined for the  web by the HTML specification.  Using Modules in Node.js  Node.js supports JavaScript’s native modules  ESM , in addition to its original CommonJS‑like  CJS   modules.4 As of this writing, ESM support is still marked “experimental” but it’s quite far along. In  v12  including the v12 long‑term status release  it’s behind an --experimental-modules flag, but it’s  no longer behind a flag in v13 and above.  CHANGES BETWEEN V8 THROUGH V11 AND V12 AND ABOVE  Node.js’s ESM support in v8 through v11 was primarily based on file extensions;  this section describes the newer behavior in v12 and above.  3 https:  wicg.github.io import-maps  4 https:  nodejs.org api esm.html   Module Fundamentals  ❘  329  Because Node.js has long has its own CJS‑based module system, you have to opt in when using ESM.  You do that in one of three ways:  1.  Have a package.json in your project with a type field with the value "module":  {     "name": "mypackage",     "type": "module",     ...other usual fields... }  2.  Use .mjs as the file extension on your ESM module files 3.  When passing a string to node  as an argument to --eval, --print, or piping text into   node , specify --input-type=module  This applies both to the entry point you provide the node command line and to any modules you  import in your ESM code.  See Listings 13‑4, 13‑5, and 13‑6 for an example with package.json with a "type": "module"  field. You’d run the example like this with v12:  node --experimental-modules index.js  With v13 and above, the flag is no longer needed:  node index.js  LISTING 13-4:  A simple Node.js module example  main entry point —index.js  import { sum } from ". sum.js";   console.log `1 + 2 = ${sum 1, 2 }` ;  LISTING 13-5:  A simple Node.js module example  sum module —sum.js  export function sum ...numbers  {     return numbers.reduce  a, b  => a + b ; }  LISTING 13-6:  A simple Node.js module example  package —package.json  {   "name": "modexample",   "type": "module" }  Alternatively, if you removed the type field from package.json  or changed it to "commonjs" , you  could use ESM by changing the names to index.mjs and sum.mjs instead  both in the names of the  files and in the import statement in index .   330  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  By default, when you’re importing a module from a file using ESM you must include the file exten‑ sion in your import statement.  More later in the “Module Specifiers in Node.js” section.  Notice  that it’s . sum.js in Listing 13‑4, not just . sum. You don’t use an extension when importing built‑in  packages such as "fs" or packages in node_modules. You just use the module name:  import fs from "fs";   fs.writeFile "example.txt", "Example of using the fs module\n", "utf8", err => {        ... } ;  The built‑in modules all provide named exports as well, so the preceding code could be written  like this:  import { writeFile } from "fs";   writeFile "example.txt", "Example of using the fs module\n", "utf8", err => {        ... } ;  Regardless of whether you’re using "type": "module" in package.json, if you import a file with  the extension .cjs, Node.js will load it as a CJS module:  import example from ". example.cjs";    example.cjs must be a CJS module  ESM modules can import from CJS modules: the exports value in the CJS module is treated like a  default export. For instance, if mod.cjs has  exports.nifty = function   { };  an ESM module would import it like this:  import mod from ". mod.cjs";  import mod from ". mod.cjs"; const { nifty } = mod;  and then either use mod.nifty or perhaps use a destructuring assignment after the import to get a  standalone nifty:  That code can’t use the named export form import { nifty } because that’s a static import declara‑ tion, which means it has to be statically analyzable. But CJS module exports are dynamic, not static:  you specify CJS exports by assigning to an exports object with runtime code. Supporting named  imports from CJS would require a change to the JavaScript specification to allow dynamic named  exports. There are ongoing discussions of whether and how to address that, but for now  or possibly  forever , the CJS exports value is supported as just the default export.  This is true even when using  dynamic import, which you’ll learn about in a later section.   CJS modules cannot import from ESM modules except through dynamic import.  Module Specifiers in Node.js  When importing a module file, module specifiers in Node.js are very much like those defined for the  web by default: absolute or relative filenames  rather than URLs , and the file extension is required.  The file extension part of that is different from Node.js’s CJS module loader, which lets you leave off    Renaming Exports  ❘  331  the extension and then checks for a file with various extensions  .js, .json, etc. . However, you can  enable that behavior using a command‑line argument. In v12, you’d do it like this:  node --experimental-modules --es-module-specifier-resolution=node index.js  In v13, the flag is slightly different  and you don’t need the modules flag :  node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node index.js  If you were using the flag, the import in Listing 13‑4 earlier could leave off the .js extension:  import { sum } from ". sum";    If node resolution mode is enabled via flag  As you saw earlier with the example using the fs module, you use bare names when importing built‑ in packages or ones installed in node_modules:  import { writeFile } from "fs";  Node.js is Adding More Module Features  Node.js isn’t just sticking with the type property in package.json and the basic features described  herein. There’s lots of work going on—export maps, various package features, etc. Most of these are  still at relatively early stages as of this writing, so I won’t go into details here as the details are a mov‑ ing target for now. You can learn about them on the Node.js website in the ECMAScript Modules  section  https:  nodejs.org api esm.html .  RENAMING EXPORTS  The identifier you export from a module doesn’t have to be the same as the identifier you use for it within  your module’s code. You can rename the export by using an as clause within the export declaration:  let nameWithinModule = 42; export { nameWithinModule as exportedName };  You’d import that in another module using the name exportedName:  import { exportedName } from ". mod.js";  The nameWithinModule is just for use within the module, not outside it.  You can only rename on export when exporting separately, not when exporting inline  so not when  doing export let nameWithinModule or similar .   If you want to create an alias  for instance, for a situation like trimLeft trimStart that you  learned about in Chapter 10 , you can both export inline with one name, and then use a renaming  export as well:  export function expandStart   {          expandStart is the primary name        ... } export { expandStart as expandLeft };    expandLeft is an alias  That code creates two exports, expandStart and expandLeft, for the same function.  You can use renaming syntax to create a default export as well, although it’s not best practice:  export { expandStart as default };    Not best practice   332  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  As you learned earlier, the default export is just like a named export using the exported name  default, so that’s equivalent to the default‑specific form you learned earlier:  export default expandStart;  RE-EXPORTING EXPORTS FROM ANOTHER MODULE  A module can re‑export another module’s exports:  export { example } from ". example.js";  These are called indirect exports.  One place this is useful is in “roll‑up” modules. Suppose you were writing a DOM manipulation  library like jQuery. While you could write it as a single massive module containing everything the  library provides, that would mean any code using it has to reference that one module, which brings  all of the module’s code into memory even if it won’t all be used.  Probably; more later when we talk  about tree shaking.  Instead, you might break the library into smaller parts that consumers of the  library could import from. For instance:  import { selectAll, selectFirst } from ". lib-select.js"; import { animate } from ". lib-animate.js";    ...code using selectAll, selectFirst, and animate...  Then, for projects that are likely to use all of the library’s features or that don’t care about loading the  entire lib into memory, the lib could provide a roll‑up module with all of its parts gathered together,  perhaps as lib.js:  export { selectAll, selectFirst, selectN } from ". lib-select.js"; export { animate, AnimationType, Animator } from ". lib-animate.js"; export { attr, hasAttr } from ". lib-manipulate.js";    ...  Code can then just use lib.js when importing all of those functions:  import { selectAll, selectFirst, animate } from ". lib.js";    ...code using selectAll, selectFirst, and animate...  Explicitly listing those exports introduces a maintenance issue, though: if you add a new export to   lib-select.js  for instance , it’s easy to forget to update lib.js to export the new item. To avoid that,  there’s a special form using an asterisk  *  that says “export all named exports from this other module”:  export * from ". lib-select.js"; export * from ". lib-animate.js"; export * from ". lib-manipulate.js";    ...  export * does not export the default export of the module, just the named ones.  Re‑exporting only creates an export; it doesn’t import the item into the scope of the module   re‑exporting it:  export { example } from ". mod.js"; console.log example ;    ReferenceError: example is not defined  If you need to import the item as well as exporting it, you do each part separately:  import { example } from ". mod.js";   Importing a Module’s Namespace Object  ❘  333  export { example }; console.log example ;  When re‑exporting, you can change the name of the export using an as clause:  export { example as mod1_example } from ". mod1.js"; export { example as mod2_example } from ". mod2.js";  As it almost literally says in the syntax, that re‑exports mod1.js’s example as mod1_example, and  mod2.js’s example as mod2_example.  There’s another way a module can export another module’s exports which you’ll learn about in  “Exporting Another Module’s Namespace Object” later in this chapter.  RENAMING IMPORTS  Suppose you have two modules that both export an example function, and you want to use both of  those functions in your module. Or the name the module used conflicts with something in your code.  If you’ve read the earlier sections about renaming exports, you’ve probably guessed you can rename  imports the same way—with an as clause:  import { example as aExample } from ". a.js"; import { example as bExample } from ". b.js";      Using them aExample  ; bExample  ;  When importing the default export, as you’ve already learned you’re always picking your own name,  so an as clause isn’t relevant:  import someName from ". mod.js"; import someOtherName from ". mod.js"; console.log someName === someOtherName ;    true  As with the renaming form of export, you can also use the renaming form of import to import the  default export if you like, although it’s not best practice:  import { default as someOtherName };    Not best practice  IMPORTING A MODULE’S NAMESPACE OBJECT  Instead of  or in addition to  importing individual exports, you can import a module namespace object  for an entire module. A module namespace object is an object with properties for all of the module’s  exports  if there’s a default export, its property’s name is, of course, default . So if you have this  module.js:  export function example   {     console.log "example called" ; } export let something = "something"; export default function   {     console.log "default called" ; }   334  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  you could import the module’s namespace object using a form of import declaration you haven’t  seen beforet:  import * as mod from ". module.js"; mod.example  ;                 example called console.log mod.something ;    something mod.default  ;                 default called  The * as mod means to import the module’s namespace object and associate it with the local   identifier  binding  mod.  The module namespace object is not the same thing as the module. It’s a separate object that is con‑ structed the first time it’s requested  never constructed at all if nothing requests it  with properties  for all of the module’s exports. The properties’ values are updated dynamically as the source module  changes the values of its exports  if it does . Once the module namespace object has been constructed,  it’s reused if other modules also import the module’s namespace object. The object is read‑only: its  properties can’t be written to, and you can’t add new properties to it.  EXPORTING ANOTHER MODULE’S NAMESPACE OBJECT  As of a normative change in ES2020 which fast‑tracked a proposal,5 a module can provide an export  that resolves to another module’s namespace object. Suppose you have this export in module1.js:     In module1.js export * as stuff from ". module2.js";  That creates a named export in module1.js called stuff that, when imported, imports the module  namespace object for module2.js. That means that in, say, module3.js, this import:     In module3.js import { stuff } from ". module1.js";  and this import:     In module3.js import * as stuff from ". module2.js";  do the same thing: import the module namespace object from module2.js, creating it if necessary,  and binding it to the local name stuff in module3.js.  As with the forms you learned in “Re‑Exporting Exports from Another Module” earlier, this is some‑ times useful when building rollup modules. It also improved the symmetry between the import forms  and the export...from forms. Just like the import form  import { x } from ". mod.js";  has the corresponding export...from form  export { x } from ". mod.js";  and the import form  import { x as v } from ". mod.js"; has the corresponding export...from form export { x as v } from ". mod.js";  5 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-export-ns-from   Import and Export Entries  ❘  335  the import form  import * as name from ". mod.js";  now has the corresponding export...from form  export * as name from ". mod.js";  IMPORTING A MODULE JUST FOR SIDE EFFECTS  You can import a module without importing anything from it, just to load and run it:  import ". mod.js";  Suppose that import is in the module main.js. This adds mod.js to the list of modules main.js  needs, but doesn’t import anything from it. Loading mod.js runs its top‑level code  after loading any  modules it depends on , so this is useful for when you only need to import the module for any side  effects its top‑level code may have.  In general, it’s best if a module’s top‑level code doesn’t have any side effects, but for the occasional use case  where making an exception is appropriate, this provides a way of triggering the module’s top‑level code.  You briefly saw one possible use case earlier in the section on the nomodule attribute: providing a mod‑ ule entry point for browsers that support modules and a non‑module entry point for browsers that don’t,  without making some browsers  Internet Explorer, some older versions of Safari and Edge, perhaps oth‑ ers  download both the module and non‑module code even though they’ll only execute one of them.  IMPORT AND EXPORT ENTRIES  When the JavaScript engine parses a module, it builds a list of the module’s import entries  the things  it imports  and a list of its export entries  the things it exports . The lists provide a way for the speci‑ fication to describe how module loading and linking happens  which you’ll learn more about later .  Your code can’t access these lists directly, but let’s take a look at them, since they’ll help you under‑ stand later sections.  Import Entries  A module’s list of import entries describes what it imports. Each import entry has three fields:  ➤➤ [[ModuleRequest]]: The module specifier string from the import declaration. This says what   ➤➤ [[ImportName]]: The name of the thing being imported. It’s "*" if you’re importing the   module the import comes from.  module namespace object.  ➤➤ [[LocalName]]: The name of the local identifier  binding  to use for the imported item.   Often, this is the same as the [[ImportName]], but if you’ve used as in the import declara‑ tion to rename the import, they can differ.  To see how these fields relate to the different forms of import declarations, see Table 13‑1 on the next  page, which is strongly based on “Table 44  Informative : Import Forms Mappings to ImportEntry  Records” from the specification.   336  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  TABLE 13-1:  Import Statements and Import Entries  IMPORT STATEMENT FORM  [[MODULEREQUEST]]  [[IMPORTNAME]]  [[LOCALNAME]]  import v from "mod";  "mod"  "default"  import * as ns from "mod";  "mod"  import {x} from "mod";  "mod"  import {x as v} from "mod";  "mod"  "*"  "x"  "x"  "v"  "ns"  "x"  "v"  import "mod";  An ImportEntry Record is not created.  The reason there’s no import entry created when you import a module just for its side effects  import  "mod"; at the end of the table  is that this list is specifically about what things  bindings  the module  imports. The list of other modules a module requests is a separate list also created during parsing;  modules imported just for their side effects are included on that other list.  This list of entries tells the JavaScript engine what this module needs in order to be loaded.  Export Entries  A module’s list of export entries describes what it exports. Each export entry has four fields:  ➤➤ [[ExportName]]: The name of the export. This is the name other modules use when import‑  ing. It’s the string "default" for the default export. It’s null for an export * from decla‑ ration that re‑exports everything from another module  instead, the export list from that  other module is used .  ➤➤ [[LocalName]]: The name of the local identifier  binding  being exported. This is often the   same as [[ExportName]], but if you’ve renamed an export, they can be different. This is  null if this entry is for an export ... from declaration that re‑exports another module’s  export s , since there’s no local name involved.  ➤➤ [[ModuleRequest]]: For re‑exports, it’s the module specifier string from the export ...   from declaration. This is null for a module’s own exports.  ➤➤ [[ImportName]]; For re‑exports, this is the name of the export in the other module to   re‑export. Often, this is the same as [[ExportName]], but if you’ve used an as clause in   the re‑export declaration, they can differ. This is null for a module’s own exports.  To see how these fields relate to the different forms of export declarations, see Table 13‑2, which is  strongly based on “Table 46  Informative : Export Forms Mappings to ExportEntry Records” from  the specification.  This list of entries tells the JavaScript engine what this module provides when it’s loaded.   Import and Export Entries  ❘  337   338  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  IMPORTS ARE LIVE AND READ-ONLY  When you import something from a module, you get a read‑only live binding, called an indirect bind- ing, to the original item. Since it’s read‑only, your code can’t assign a new value to the binding; but  since it’s a live binding, your code does see any new values that the original module assigns to it. For  instance, suppose you had the mod.js shown in Listing 13‑7 and the main.js shown in Listing 13‑8   you can run these from the downloads using the provided main.html file .  LISTING 13-7:  A simple module with counter—mod.js  const a = 1; let c = 0; export { c as counter }; export function increment   {     ++c; }  LISTING 13-8:  A module using the counter module—main.js  import { counter, increment as inc } from ". mod.js"; console.log counter ;    0 inc  ; console.log counter ;    1 counter = 42;            TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.  As you can see, the code in main.js sees changes to counter that mod.js makes, but cannot directly  set its value. The error message shown in the listing is V8’s current message  in Chrome ; SpiderMonkey   in Firefox  says TypeError: "counter" is read-only.  You’ll recall from Chapter 2’s “Bindings: How Variables, Constants,  and Other Identifiers Work” section that variables, constants, and other  identifiers are conceptually bindings in an environment object  very  similar to properties in an object . Each binding has a name, a flag for  whether it’s mutable  mutable = you can change its value, immutable =  you can’t , and the current value of the binding. For instance, this code:  const a = 1;  Environment Environment  Bindings: Bindings:  "a" "a" identifier identifier  Name:  Name:  Type:  Type:  Value:  1 Value:  1 Mutable: false Mutable: false  creates a binding within the current environment object as in Figure 13‑3.  FIGURE 13-3   Each module has a module environment object.  Don't confuse this  with the similarly named “module namespace object;” they’re different things.  The module environ‑ ment object has bindings for all of the exports and imports of that module  but not its re‑exports  from other modules  as well as other top‑level bindings that aren't either exported or imported    bindings just used within the module . In a module environment object, bindings can be either direct    Imports Are Live and Read-Only  ❘  339   for exports and non‑exported bindings  or indirect  for imports . An indirect binding stores a link to  the source module  which links to that module’s environment object  and the name of the binding in  that module’s environment to use, rather than directly storing the value of the binding.  When main.js imports from mod.js as shown in the listings, main.js’s module environment  has indirect bindings for counter and inc that refer to the mod.js module and its environment  object’s c and increment bindings, as in Figure 13‑4. In the indirect bindings, Module is the link  to the module, and Binding Name is the name of the binding in that module’s environment to use.  "main.js" Environment "main.js" Environment  "mod.js" Module "mod.js" Module  Bindings: Bindings:  [[Environment]] [[Environment]]  "mod.js" Environment "mod.js" Environment  Name:  Name:  Type:  Type:  Mutable:  Mutable:  Module:  Module:  Binding Name:  "c" Binding Name:  "c"  "counter" "counter" indirect indirect false false  Name:  Name:  Type:  Type:  Mutable:  Mutable:  Module:  Module:  Binding Name:  "increment" Binding Name:  "increment"  "inc" "inc" indirect indirect false false  Bindings: Bindings:  "a" "a" identifier identifier  Name:  Name:  Type:  Type:  Value:  1 Value:  1 Mutable: false Mutable: false  "c" "c" identifier identifier  Name:  Name:  Type:  Type:  Value:  0 Value:  0 Mutable: true Mutable: true  "increment" Name:  "increment" Name:  identifier Type:  identifier Type:  Value:   function  Value:   function  Mutable: true Mutable: true  FIGURE 13-4    You may be wondering how main.js knows that the binding for the counter export it imported  from mod.js is c. The JavaScript engine got that information from the list of export entries for   mod.js that you learned about in the last section. You’ll learn more about this in a bit.   When main.js reads the value of counter, the JavaScript engine sees that main.js’s environ‑ ment object has an indirect binding for counter, gets the environment object for mod.js, then  gets the value of the binding named c from that module’s environment object and uses that as the  resulting value.  This read‑only‑but‑may‑change nature of imported bindings is also evident in the properties of a  module namespace object: you can only read the values of the properties, you can’t set their values.   340  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  MODULE NAMESPACE OBJECT PROPERTY DESCRIPTIONS  If you use Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor on the module namespace object  property for an export, the descriptor you get back always looks like this:     {        value:  *...the value...* ,        writable: true,        enumerable: true,        configurable: false    }  The descriptor doesn’t vary other than the value. For instance, the descriptor for a  property representing a const export looks exactly the same as the descriptor for  a property representing a let export. But although the property says its writable,  if you try to write to the property, you get an error that it’s read‑only.  The module  namespace object has a special internal [[Set]] method that prevents setting the value  of any property.  It may seem odd that the property claims to be writable when you  can’t write to it, but it’s marked that way for a reason. A couple of reasons, in fact:  ➤➤  ➤➤  Information about a module’s internal structure shouldn’t be revealed outside  the module, so having a const export and a let export  or function export,  etc.  look the same is important.  There may be an argument that exporting  a const means you’re exporting not just its existence but also the fact it’s a  const, but for now at least the information is hidden.   If the property were marked writable: false, one might mistakenly  assume that the value couldn’t change, but of course the value can change if  it’s not a const and the exporting module’s code changes it. In fact, one of  the important object behavior guarantees the specification dictates is that  if a non‑configurable, non‑writable data property  not accessor  has been  observed to have a value, reading it again later must return that same value.   This is in the spec’s “Invariants of the Essential Internal Methods” section.6  You’ll learn more about these invariant behavior guarantees in Chapter 14.   No object is allowed to break that rule. So these properties have to be  defined as writable.  MODULE INSTANCES ARE REALM-SPECIFIC  Earlier you learned  in passing  that a module is loaded only once per realm  window, tab, worker, etc. .  Specifically, the JavaScript engine keeps track of loaded modules within the realm and reuses ones that are  requested more than once. That’s realm‑specific, though; different realms do not share module instances.  6 https:  tc39.github.io ecma262 sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods   How Modules Are Loaded  ❘  341  For instance, if you have a window with an iframe in it, the main window and the iframe’s window  have different realms. If code in both windows loads the module mod.js, it gets loaded twice: once in  the main window’s realm, and again in the iframe window’s realm. Those two copies of the module  are completely separate from one another, even more so than the two global environments in the win‑ dows  which have links between them via the main window’s frames array and the iframe window’s  parent variable . Any modules loaded by mod.js are also loaded twice, as are their dependencies,  etc. Modules are only shared within the realm, not between realms.  HOW MODULES ARE LOADED  The JavaScript module system is designed to keep simple use cases simple, but to handle complex use  cases well. To do that, modules are loaded in three phases:  ➤➤ Fetching and Parsing: Fetching the module’s source text and parsing it, determining its   imports and exports.  ➤➤ Instantiation: Creating the module’s environment and its bindings, including bindings for   all of its imports and exports.  ➤➤ Evaluation: Running the module’s code.  To illustrate the process, we’ll refer to the code in Listings 13‑9 through 13‑12.  LISTING 13-9:  HTML page for module loading example—loading.html           Module Loading              LISTING 13-10:  Module loading entry point—entry.js  import { fn1 } from ". mod1.js"; import def, { fn2 } from ". mod2.js";   fn1  ; fn2  ; def  ;   342  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  LISTING 13-11:  Module loading mod1—mod1.js  import def from ". mod2.js";   const indentString = "  ";   export function indent nest = 0  {     return indentString.repeat nest ; }   export function fn1 nest = 0  {     console.log `${indent nest }mod1 - fn1` ;     def nest + 1 ; }  LISTING 13-12:  Module loading mod2—mod2.js  import { fn1, indent } from ". mod1.js";   export function fn2 nest = 0  {     console.log `${indent nest }mod2 - fn2` ;     fn1 nest + 1 ; }  export default function nest = 0  {     console.log `${indent nest }mod2 - default` ; }  As you can see from the listings, the entry.js module imports from two other modules, which are  interdependent: mod1.js uses mod2.js’s default export, and mod2.js uses mod1.js’s named exports  fn1 and indent. The two modules are in a cyclic relationship. Most of your modules won’t have  cyclic relationships like that, but having that relationship lets the example show the basics of how  that’s handled.  When you run the listings’ code from the downloads, this is the result you’ll see in the console:  mod1 - fn1   mod2 - default mod2 - fn2   mod1 - fn1     mod2 - default mod2 - default  Fetching and Parsing  When the host  the browser  sees the  Let’s look at how the browser  the host for the JavaScript engine in this example  gets there.      tag, it fetches entry.js and passes the source text to the JavaScript engine to parse as a module.  Unlike non‑module scripts, module scripts don’t hold up the HTML parser, so the HTML parser    How Modules Are Loaded  ❘  343  continues while the work to parse and load the  module is done. Specifically, a module script is, by  default, deferred  as though it had the defer attrib‑ ute , which means that its code won’t be evaluated  until the HTML parser has finished parsing the page.   You can specify async instead if you want evaluation  to happen as soon as possible, even before the HTML  parser is done.   When the browser passes the contents of entry.js   to the JavaScript engine, the engine parses it and  creates a module record for it. The module record  contains the parsed code, a list of the modules that  this module requires, the module’s lists of import  entries and export entries that you learned about a  couple of sections ago, and various other bookkeep‑ ing details such as the status of the module  where it  is in the process of being loaded and evaluated . Note  that all of that information was determined statically,  just by parsing the module’s code, not executing it.  See Figure 13‑5 for what the key parts of the module  record for entry.js would look like.  The names  in the figure are from the  specification, which uses  the convention [[Name]]— a name in double square  brackets—for fields in conceptual objects.   Module Record Module Record  [[ECMAScriptCode]]:  import { fn1 } from ". mod1.js"; import def, { fn2 } from ". mod2.js";  fn1  ; fn2  ; def  ;  [[RequestedModules]]:  ". mod1.js" ". mod2.js"  [[ImportEntries]]:  "fn1" "fn1"  ModuleSpecifier: ". mod1.js" ImportName:  LocalName:  ModuleSpecifier: ". mod2.js" ImportName:  LocalName:  ModuleSpecifier: ". mod2.js" ImportName:  LocalName:   "default" "def"  "fn2" "fn2"  [[LocalExportEntries]]:   none   [[IndirectExportEntries]]:   none   ...  FIGURE 13-5   The JavaScript engine returns that module record to  the host, which saves it in a map of resolved modules   the module map  under its fully resolved module specifier  for instance,   http:  localhost entry.js if loading.html is from http:  localhost . See Figure 13‑6.

FIGURE 13-6    344  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  Later, when the module’s record is needed, the JavaScript engine asks the host for it; the host looks it  up in the module map and returns it if found.  At this point entry.js has been fetched and parsed, so the JavaScript engine starts entry.js’s  instantiation phase  covered in the next section . Essentially the first thing that does is ask the  browser to resolve mod1.js and mod2.js, which the browser and JavaScript engine interact to do  just like they did with entry.js. Once they’re fetched and parsed, the browser has a module map  with entries for all three modules; see Figure 13‑7.  Module Map Module Map  "http:  localhost entry.js" "http:  localhost mod1.js" "http:  localhost mod2.js"  Module Record Module Record  [[ECMAScriptCode]]:      import { fn1 } from ". mod1.js"; import def, { fn2 } from ". mod2.js";  [[RequestedModules]]: ...

FIGURE 13-7   The information in the module records lets the JavaScript engine determine the tree of modules that  need to be instantiated and evaluated.7 In this example, the tree looks something like Figure 13‑8.  Now, the instantiation can get properly underway.  Instantiation  In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates each module’s environment object and the top‑level bind‑ ings within it, including bindings for all of the module’s imports and exports  along with any other   7  Pedants like to point out that it’s a graph, not a tree, since it can have cyclic relationships. But nearly everyone else calls  it the module tree.

For locals  including exported ones , these are  direct bindings. For imports, these are indirect bindings that the engine wires up to the exporting  module’s binding for the export. Instantiation is done using depth‑first traversal, so that the lowest‑ level modules are instantiated first. In the current example, the resulting environments look something  like Figure 13‑9.  mod1.js environment mod1.js environment  indirect indirect  def:    def:    indentString:  uninitialized indentString:  uninitialized indent:  indent:  fn1:   fn1:    function function function function  mod2.js environment mod2.js environment  fn1:    fn1:    indent:  indent:  *default*:  *default*:  fn2:   fn2:    indirect indirect indirect indirect function function function function  entry.js environment entry.js environment  fn1: indirect fn1: indirect def: indirect def: indirect fn2: indirect fn2: indirect  FIGURE 13-9    346  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  If you look closely at Figure 13‑9, you may wonder about that binding with the name *default*.  That’s the name the local binding for the default export gets if what it’s exporting is anonymous  an  anonymous function declaration, anonymous class declaration, or the result of an arbitrary expres‑ sion . Since mod2.js’s default export is an anonymous function declaration, the local binding for it is  called *default*.  But again, code in the module can’t actually use that binding.   Instantiating a module creates its scope  its environment object and bindings , but doesn’t run its  code. That means that hoistable declarations  such as all of the functions in this example’s modules   are processed, creating the functions for them, but lexical bindings are left uninitialized—they’re in  the Temporal Dead Zone  TDZ  you learned about in Chapter 2. That’s why in Figure 13‑9, you see  that indent and *default* and others have values  functions , but indentString is uninitialized.  More about the TDZ in a little bit.  Does the idea of the environment getting created and the hoistable declarations being processed  before the step‑by‑step code execution begins sound familiar? Right! It’s a lot like the first part of  calling a function, which also creates the environment for the call to the function and does all the  hoistable work before starting the step‑by‑step work.  Once all modules are instantiated, the third phase can begin: evaluation.  Evaluation  In this phase, the JavaScript engine runs the top‑level code of the modules, again in depth‑first order,  marking each of them as “evaluated” as it goes. This is like the second part of a function call, the  step‑by‑step execution of the code. As the code runs, any top‑level uninitialized bindings  like   mod1.js’s indentString  get initialized as they’re reached in the code execution.  The JavaScript module system ensures that each module’s top‑level code is run just once. This is  important, because modules may have side effects, although in the general case it’s best if they don’t   other than the main module of a page application .  As you learned earlier, on browsers if the script tag for the entry point doesn’t have the async  attribute, evaluation won’t begin until the HTML parser is done parsing the document. If the async  attribute is present, evaluation will begin as soon as possible after instantiation is complete, even if  the HTML parser is still working on the document.  Temporal Dead Zone  TDZ  Review  Modules can contain  and import export  top‑level lexical bindings  those created with let, const,  and class . You’ll remember from Chapter 2 that lexical bindings are created when the environment  object for the scope they appear in is created but aren’t initialized until the declaration is reached in  the step‑by‑step execution of the code. Between creation and initialization they’re in the Temporal  Dead Zone; if you try to use them, you get an error:  function example   {     console.log a ;    ReferenceError: a is not defined     const a = 42; } example  ;   How Modules Are Loaded  ❘  347  In that example, the environment object for the call to example is created upon entry to   example, and so it has the a binding for its local const, but the binding is not yet initialized. When  the code starts and the console.log gets run, since the binding for a is uninitialized, the attempt to  use a fails.  You’ll also recall that the Temporal Dead Zone is called temporal because it relates to the time  between creation and initialization, not the relative location of the code “above” or “below” the dec‑ laration. The following works just fine:  function example   {     const fn =    => {         console.log a ;    42     };     const a = 42;     fn  ; } example  ;  It works because although the console.log line using a is above it in the code, that line isn’t exe‑ cuted until after the declaration has been reached in the step‑by‑step execution of the code.  Finally, you’ll remember that the TDZ only relates to lexical bindings, not to bindings created via  hoistable declarations: var‑declared variables or function declarations. A binding created with var is  immediately initialized with the value undefined, and a binding created by a function declaration   is immediately initialized with the function it declares.  How does this relate to modules? The TDZ applies to any time an environment object is created and  gets its bindings—including the environment for a module. As you learned in the previous sections,  the environment object for a module is created during module instantiation, and its code is run later  during module evaluation. So any lexical bindings the module has in its top‑level scope are in the  TDZ from instantiation until the declaration is reached during evaluation.  This all means that if a module exports a lexical binding, in some situations that may make it pos‑ sible for code to try to use the binding before it’s initialized. For example, that’s possible if module  A imports from module B, and module B imports from module A  directly or indirectly —a cyclic  dependency. Let’s look at that.  Cyclic Dependencies and the TDZ  In the module‑loading example, mod1.js and mod2.js refer to one‑another; they’re in a cyclic  dependency  a simple direct one . That’s not a problem for the JavaScript module system, because of  the three‑phase process of loading and evaluating modules.  Notice how neither mod1.js nor mod2.js uses what it imports from the other in its top‑level  code; they only use what they imported in response to a function call. Suppose you changed that:  modify your local copy of mod2.js to add a call to console.log at the top level as indicated in  Listing 13‑13.   348  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  LISTING 13-13:  Module loading mod2  updated —mod2-updated.js  import { fn1, indent } from ". mod1.js";   console.log `${indent 0 }hi there` ;   export function fn2 nest = 0  {     console.log `${indent nest }mod2 - fn2` ;     fn1 nest + 1 ; }  export default function nest = 0  {     console.log `${indent nest }mod2 - default` ; }  Now reload loading.html. You get  ReferenceError: indentString is not defined  because mod2.js tries to use indent before mod1.js has been evaluated. The call to indent   works, because mod1.js has been instantiated and so its hoistable declarations have been processed,  but when indent tries to use indentString, it fails because indentString is still in the TDZ.  Now, try changing the declaration of indentString to a var instead of a const, and reload   loading.html. You get a different error  TypeError: Cannot read property 'repeat' of undefined  because the binding was initialized with the value undefined during instantiation, since it’s declared  with var, and it hasn't been assigned the string with two spaces in it yet because the top‑level code in  mod1.js hasn't been evaluated yet.  Often, a cyclic dependency suggests that you may want to refactor. But when you can’t avoid them,  just remember that hoisted declarations will be fine  other than var‑declared variables having the  value undefined , and others will be fine if only used within functions  that aren't called directly from  the top‑level code , not in the top‑level module code.  IMPORT EXPORT SYNTAX REVIEW  You’ve learned about several different syntax options for import and export in this chapter. Let’s do a  quick roundup of them, showing you all of your options.  Export Varieties  Here’s a rundown of the various export forms.  Each of the following declares a local binding  variable, constant, function, or class  and an export  for it, using the binding’s name for the export:  export var a; export var b =  *...some value...* ;   Import Export Syntax Review  ❘  349  export let c; export let d =  *...some value...* ; export const e =  *...some value...* ; export function f   {     and async and generator forms  } export class G   { }  Each of the following declares exports for local bindings declared elsewhere in the module  they can  be declared above or below the export declaration :  export { a }; export { b, c }; export { d as delta };         The exported name is `delta` export { e as epsilon, f };    The local `e` is exported as `epsilon` export { g, h as hotel, i};    You can mix the various forms  For each binding, the binding’s name is used for the export unless the as clause is included, in which  case the name given after as is used for the export instead. The list of exports  the part within the  curly braces  can have as many or as few exports in it as you like.  Each of the following declares an indirect export or exports, re‑exporting one or more of mod.js’s  exports from the current module, optionally doing some renaming via the as clause:  export { a } from ". mod.js"; export { b, c } from ". mod.js"; export { d as delta } from ". mod.js"; export { e, f as foxtrot } from ". mod.js";    You can do a mix of the above  This declares indirect exports for all named exports in mod.js:  export * from ". mod.js";  Each of the following declares a local binding  variable, constant, function, or class  and declares it as  the default export:     Only one of these can appear in any given module, since there can    only be one default export in a module export default function a   {  *...*  } export default class B {  *...*  } export default let c; export default let d = "delta"; export default const e = "epsilon"; export default var f; export default var g = "golf";  Each of the following declares a local binding called *default*  because each of these is anonymous ,  which your code cannot access since *default* is an invalid identifier. They export it as the default export:  export default function   {  *...*  } export default class {  *...*  } export default 6 * 7;    Any arbitrary expression  The function created by the anonymous function declaration will get "default" as its name, as will  the class constructor created by the anonymous class declaration.   350  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  Import Varieties  Here’s a rundown of the various import forms.  This imports the named export example from mod.js, using example as the local name as well:  import { example } from ". mod.js";  This imports the named export example from mod.js, using e as the local name instead of example:  import { example as e } from ". mod.js";  This imports the default export of mod.js, using example as the local name:  import example from ". mod.js";  This imports the module namespace object for mod.js, using the local name mod.  import * as mod from ". mod.js";  You can combine importing the default with either importing the module namespace object or named  imports, but to avoid parsing complexity, you can’t combine importing the namespace with named  exports; you can’t do all three together; and if importing the default, it has to come first, before the *  for the namespace object or the { to start the list of named imports:  import def, * as ns from ". mod.js";               Valid import * as ns, def from ". mod.js";               INVALID, default must be first import def, { a, b as bee} from ". mod.js";        Valid import * as ns, { a, b as bee} from ". mod.js";    INVALID, can't combine these  Finally, this imports mod.js just for its side effects, without importing any of its exports:  import ". mod.js";  DYNAMIC IMPORT  The import mechanism described so far in this chapter is a static mechanism:  ➤➤ Module specifiers are string literals, not expressions resulting in strings. ➤➤ Imports and exports can only be declared at the top level of a module, not within control   ➤➤ A module’s imports and exports can be determined by parsing the code without running it   flow statements like if or while.   they can be statically analyzed .  As a result, a module can’t use information it gets at runtime to decide what to import or where it  comes from.  In the vast majority of cases, this is what you want. It makes it possible for tools to do very power‑ ful things, such as tree shaking  which you’ll learn about later  and automatic bundling  figuring out  what modules to include in a unified bundle without having a separate bundle manifest, which is a  maintenance hassle , etc.  8 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-dynamic-import   Dynamic Import  ❘  351  However, some use cases require that modules determine what to import, or from where, at runtime.  For that reason, ES2020 adds dynamic import.8 As of this writing it’s widely supported, of the major  browsers only the old non‑Chromium‑based version of Edge and, of course, Internet Explorer don’t  support it.  Importing a Module Dynamically  Dynamic import adds new syntax allowing import to be called as though it were a function. When  called, import returns a promise of the module’s namespace object:  import  *...some runtime-determined name...*   .then ns => {        ...use `ns`... }  .catch error => {        Handle report error } ;     DOESN'T WORK const imp = import; imp  *...some runtime-determined name...*   .then    ...  There are two reasons for this:  Note that while it looks like a function call, import ...  is not a function call; it’s new syntax called  an ImportCall. As a result, you can’t do this:  ➤➤ The call needs to carry context information that normal function calls don’t carry. ➤➤ Disallowing aliasing of it  the imp example earlier  makes it possible for static analysis   to know whether dynamic import is used in a module  even if it can’t determine what,   specifically, that dynamic import does . You’ll learn more about why this is important in the  section later on tree shaking.  One obvious application for dynamic import is plugins: suppose you’re writing a graphics editor in  JavaScript as an Electron or Windows Universal Application or similar and want to allow extensions  to provide transforms or custom pens or similar. Your code could look for plugins in some plugins  location, and then load them with code similar to:     Loads the plugins in parallel, returns object with `plugins` array    of loaded plugins and `failed` array of failed loads  with `error`    and `pluginFile` properties . async function loadPlugins editor, discoveredPluginFiles  {     const plugins = [];     const failed = [];     await Promise.all          discoveredPluginFiles.map async  pluginFile  => {             try {                 const plugin = await import pluginFile ;                 plugin.init editor ;                 plugins.push plugin ;   352  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules              } catch  error  {                 failed.push {error, pluginFile} ;             }         }            return {plugins, failed}; }  Or perhaps you’d load a localizer for the app based on the locale:  async function loadLocalizer editor, locale  {     const localizer = await import `. localizers ${locale}.js` ;     localizer.localize editor ; }  Dynamically loaded modules are cached just like statically loaded modules.   Importing a module dynamically kicks off the process of loading any static dependencies it expresses,  and their dependencies, etc., just like loading the entry point module does.  Let’s look at an example.  Dynamic Module Example  Run the code from Listings 13‑14 through 13‑19 by running dynamic-example.html.

When you load the dynamic-example.html page, you’ll see output like this  on the page itself rather  than the console :  log module evaluated entry point module top-level evaluation begin entry point module requesting . dynamic-mod1.js entry point module top-level evaluation end showtime module evaluated dynamic module number 1 evaluated entry point module got module . dynamic-mod1.js, calling mod.example Number 1! Number 1! Number 1! log === logFromEntry? true Time is 12:44  In that example, dynamic module Number 1 was loaded, but it could just as easily have  been Number 2.  Let’s go through what happens there:  ➤➤ The host  browser  and JavaScript engine go through the fetching and parsing, instantiation,   and evaluation process on the entry point module and the dynamic-mod-log.js module it  statically imports  I’ll just call this the “log module” ; that’s the entire static tree, just those  two modules.  See Figure 13‑10.  Since evaluation is depth‑first, the log module is evaluated  first  “log module evaluated” , and then the entry point module is evaluated  “entry point  module top‑level evaluation begin”, etc. .

The dynamic module has two  static imports: log from the log module and showTime from the dynamic-mod-showtime.js   module  I’ll just call it the “showtime module” . The showtime module also imports log  from the log module. When the parsing is complete, the tree of modules to process for this  import call contains those three modules, but it connects to the existing tree  from the  initial static import . See Figure 13‑11. Note that the status  “[[Status]]”  of the log module  is "evaluated", so it’s already been through all three parts of the loading process and isn’t  processed again. The showtime module hasn’t been loaded yet, though, so it goes through  the process with the dynamic module and, since it’s deeper in the loading tree, it gets evalu‑ ated first  “showtime module evaluated” . Then the dynamic module is evaluated  “dynamic  module number 1 evaluated” .  The only reason the example has the showtime module  in this example is to demonstrate how it’s different from the log module because the log  module had already been evaluated, but the showtime module was loaded for the first time  by the dynamic module.   static starting point static starting point  import "dynamic-example-dynmod1.js"  starting point import "dynamic-example-dynmod1.js"  starting point  Module Record Module Record  Module Record Module Record  http:  localhost dynamic-example.js http:  localhost dynamic-example.js  http:  localhost dynamic-example-dynmod1.js http:  localhost dynamic-example-dynmod1.js  [[Status]]: "evaluated" [[Status]]: "evaluated" [[ECMAScriptCode]]: [[ECMAScriptCode]]:     [[RequestedModules]]: [[RequestedModules]]: ... ...   { ... }  { ... }  [[Status]]: "instantiating" [[Status]]: "instantiating" [[ECMAScriptCode]]: [[ECMAScriptCode]]:     [[RequestedModules]]: [[RequestedModules]]: ... ...   { ... }  { ... }  http:  localhost dynamic-example-log.js http:  localhost dynamic-example-log.js  http:  localhost dynamic-example-show-time.js http:  localhost dynamic-example-show-time.js  Module Record Module Record  Module Record Module Record  [[Status]]: "evaluated" [[Status]]: "evaluated" [[ECMAScriptCode]]: [[ECMAScriptCode]]:     [[RequestedModules]]: [[RequestedModules]]: ... ...   { ... }  { ... }  FIGURE 13-11   [[Status]]: "uninstantiated" [[Status]]: "uninstantiated" [[ECMAScriptCode]]: [[ECMAScriptCode]]:     [[RequestedModules]]: [[RequestedModules]]: ... ...   { ... }  { ... }  ➤➤ The loading process for the import   call is complete, so its promise is fulfilled with the   module namespace object for the dynamic module.  ➤➤ The entry module’s async function continues from the await  “entry point got module    . dynamic‑mod1.js, calling mod.example”  and calls mod.example, passing in its reference to  the log function from the log module.   356  ❘  CHAPTER 13    Modules  ➤➤ The dynamic module’s example function runs, outputting its module‑specific message and  then “log === logFromEntry? true”. The true shows that the static and dynamic processes  work with the same set of module records and associated environments; there is only one  copy of the log module loaded, and so only one log function.  ➤➤ Finally, the dynamic module calls showTime.  Dynamic Import in Non-Module Scripts  Unlike static import, dynamic import can also be used in scripts, not just in modules. Look at List‑ ings 13‑20 and 13‑21, which are a different HTML page and entry point for the earlier dynamic  example  reusing the remaining files .  LISTING 13-20:  Dynamic module loading in script  HTML —dynamic-example-2.html           Dynamic Module Loading in Script - Example              LISTING 13-21:  Dynamic module loading in script example  entry point —dynamic- example-2.js   async   => {     try {         const {log} = await import ". dynamic-mod-log.js" ;         log "entry point module got log" ;         const modName = `. dynamic-mod${Math.random   < 0.5 ? 1 : 2}.js`;         log `entry point module requesting ${modName}` ;         const mod = await import modName ;         log `entry point module got module ${modName}, calling mod.example` ;         mod.example log ;     } catch  error  {         console.error error ;     } }   ;  As you can see, dynamic-example-2.js is being loaded as a script; there’s no type="module" on its  script tag. If you look at its code, it’s similar in many ways to the dynamic-example.js code ear‑ lier, but it uses an import   call instead of a static import declaration. When you run it, the output    Tree Shaking  ❘  357  is the same as before other than the fact the entry point code couldn’t log the beginning and ending of  the top‑level evaluation because it had to wait for the log module, which arrives after top‑level evalu‑ ation is complete:  log module evaluated entry point module got log entry point module requesting . dynamic-mod1.js showtime module evaluated dynamic module number 1 evaluated entry point module got module . dynamic-mod1.js, calling mod.example Number 1! Number 1! Number 1! log === logFromEntry? true Time is 12:44  Under the covers, it works largely the same as well, other than that the relationship between the entry  point and the log module can no longer be determined through static analysis  although since the  code uses a string literal to call import  , a clever tool can work it out .  One key difference, though, is that instead of just importing the named export, log, from the log  module, the dynamic version imports the entire namespace object for the log module  but uses  destructuring to pick out just the log function . In contrast, the module namespace object is never  created in the static example, because nothing ever asks for it.  TREE SHAKING  Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. Live code is code that’s potentially used by the page  or application; dead code is code that definitely won’t get used by the page or application  in its cur‑ rent form . Tree shaking is the process of analyzing the module tree to get rid of the dead code.  The  term tree shaking comes from the image of shaking a tree vigorously to get the dead wood to fall out,  while the living wood stays put.   Let’s revise the first example in this chapter by adding a function to the log module it uses; see List‑ ings 13‑22 to 13‑24.  LISTING 13-22:  An updated simple module example  HTML —simple2.html           Revised Simple Module Example               358  ❘  CHAPTER 13    MODULES        LISTING 13-23 :         An updated simple module example  entry point module —simple2.js          import { log } from ". log2.js";     log "Hello, modules!" ;        LISTING 13-24 :         An updated simple module example  log module —log2.js          export function log msg  {         const p = document.createElement "pre" ;       p.appendChild document.createTextNode msg  ;       document.body.appendChild p ;   }     export function stamplog msg  {         return log `${new Date  .toISOString  }: ${msg}` ;     }          If you review the code in the listings, there are five things to make note of:  ➤   Nothing ever requests the named export  stamplog.   ➤  Nothing ever requests the log module ’ s module namespace object  if something did, a smart  tree shaking tool might still be able to perform escape analysis on the resulting object to see if its stamplog  property is ever used .  ➤  Nothing in the log module ’ s top-level code uses stamplog .   ➤  Nothing in the log module ’ s other exported functions, or functions they call, uses stamplog .   ➤  Only static  import  declarations are used, no import    calls.   Additionally, all of that information can be determined with  static analysis   just parsing and examining the code, without running it . That means that if you pointed a JavaScript bundler at simple.html  and told it to bundle all the code together into an optimized file, it could determine— without running the code—that stamplog  wasn ’ t used anywhere and could be left out.   That ’ s tree shaking. Tree shaking is one reason JavaScript bundlers aren ’ t going away in the foresee- able future, despite native support for modules in browsers. Here ’ s the result of using one bundler on this simple example, in this case, using Rollup.js and setting its output option to iife   immediately- invoked function expression , but you ’ ll get similar results with any tree shaking bundler; more in the next section:       function    {         "use strict";           function log msg  {           const p = document.createElement "pre" ;           p.appendChild document.createTextNode msg  ;             document.body.appendChild p ;       }           log "Hello, modules!" ;       }   ;        Bundling ❘ 359   That one block of code is the optimized  but not minified  combination of  simple.js  plus log.js. The  stamplog  function is nowhere to be found.   Remember the last of the “five things to make note of” earlier?  ➤   Only static  import  declarations are used, no import    calls.   In theory, even a single use of  import    with anything but a string literal in any module in the tree  means tools can ’ t do tree shaking, since they can ’ t prove that something really is unused. In practice, different bundlers will optimize the impact of dynamic imports in different ways and likely provide configuration options to give you control over whether and how aggressively they attempt to tree- shake them.      BUNDLING   Although modules are natively supported by modern browsers now, people have been using the  syntax for a while by using JavaScript bundlers to convert the modules into optimized files that work on browsers without module support. Projects like Rollup.js  https:  rollupjs.org   and Webpack  https:  webpack.js.org    are hugely popular and feature-rich.    On a project of any size, you ’ re likely to want to use a bundler even if you ’ re only targeting browsers  with native module support. Tree shaking is one reason. Another is simply that transferring all of the  individual module resources over HTTP  even HTTP 2  is still potentially slower than transferring a single resource.  Definitely slower if you ’ re stuck with only HTTP 1.1.    Google did an analysis 9   comparing native module loading with loading bundles, using two popular real-world libraries—Moment.js and Three.js—as well as many synthetically generated modules to determine whether bundling was still useful and where the bottlenecks were in Chrome ’ s loading pipeline. The version of Moment.js 10  they tested used 104 modules, with a maximum tree depth of 6; the version of Three.js11  they tested used 333 modules with a maximum depth of 5.    Based on the results of the analysis, Addy Osmani and Mathias Bynens, both at Google,  recommend:12  ➤   Using native support during development  ➤  Using native support in production for small web apps with fewer than 100 modules and a  shallow dependency tree  maximum depth less than 5  that target only modern browsers  ➤  Using bundling for production for anything larger than that or projects targeting browsers  without module support      There are tradeoffs either way, particularly if you ’ re stuck with HTTP 1.1 for some reason. The full  article is worth a read, and they ’ ll likely add links to updated research over time.    9 https:  docs.google.com document d 1ovo4PurT_1K4WFwN2MYmmgbLcr7v6DRQN67ESVA-wq0 pub 10 https:  momentjs.com  11 https:  threejs.org  12 https:  developers.google.com web fundamentals primers modules   360  ❘  CHAPTER 13    MODULES    IMPORT METADATA   Occasionally, a module may need to know things about itself, such as what URL or path it was  loaded from, whether it ’ s the “main” module  in environments where there is a single main module,  such as Node.js , etc. ES2015 ’ s modules don ’ t currently provide any way for a module to get that information.  ES2020 adds a way for a module to get information about itself: import.meta . 13  import.meta  is an object, specific to the module, that contains properties about the module. The prop- erties themselves are host-specified and will vary by environment  for instance, browser vs. Node.js .    In the web environment, the properties of  import.meta  are defined by the HTML specification, in its  HostGetImportMetaProperties  section.14   At the moment, only a single property is defined: url . It ’ s a string giving the fully resolved URL of the module. For instance,  import.meta.url  in  mod.js loaded from  http:  localhost  would have the value  "http:  localhost mod.js" . Node.js also  supports  url15   by giving the absolute  file:  URL of the module. Over time, it ’ s likely further proper- ties will be added to either or both environments.    The  import.meta  object is created the first time it ’ s accessed, through coordination between the JavaScript engine and the host. Because it ’ s module-specific, it ’ s largely owned by the module, and that ’ s reflected in the fact that it ’ s not locked down in any way: you can add properties to it for your  own purposes  though it ’ s not clear why you ’ d want to , or even change the default properties it  comes with  unless the host prevents it, which it ’ s allowed to do .    WORKER MODULES   By default, web workers are loaded as classic scripts, not modules. They can load other scripts via importScripts , but it ’ s the old-fashioned way where communication with the loading script is through the worker ’ s global environment. But web workers can be modules, so that they can use import and export declarations.    Similarly, Node.js ’ s workers can now be ESM modules as well.   Let ’ s look at each of those.     Loading a Web Worker as a Module   To load a worker as a module, so it gets all the usual benefits of being a module, you use the type  option in the options object passed as a second argument to the  Worker  constructor:      const worker = new Worker ". worker.js", {type: "module"} ;   You can launch a worker this way from within a module or a classic script. Also, unlike classic script  workers, you can launch module workers cross-origin provided they ’ re served with Cross Origin Resource Sharing  CORS  information that allows the launching origin to use them.   13 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-import-meta 14 https:  html.spec.whatwg.org multipage webappapis.htmlhostgetimportmetaproperties 15 https:  nodejs.org api esm.htmlesm_import_meta   Worker Modules ❘ 361   If the browser supports workers as modules, the worker will be loaded as a module. As of this writing in early 2020, browser support for worker modules isn ’ t widespread, though Chrome and other browsers based on the Chromium project  Chromium, newer versions of Edge  support them  .   Listings   13-25   to   13-27   show an example of loading a worker as a module.         LISTING 13-25 :         Web worker as module  HTML —worker-example.html                                 Web Worker Module Example                    const worker = new Worker ". worker-example-worker.js", {type: "module"} ;   worker.addEventListener "message", e => {         console.log `Message from worker: ${e.data}` ;     } ;                      LISTING 13-26 :         Web worker as module  worker —worker-example-worker.js          import { example } from ". worker-example-mod.js";       postMessage `example 4  = ${example 4 }` ;               LISTING 13-27 :         Web worker as module  module —worker-example-mod.js          export const example = a => a * 2;    Loading a Node.js Worker as a Module   Node.js ’ s support for ESM modules extends to worker threads. The same rules apply as for other ways of running code. You can launch a worker as a module by having a type: "module"  setting in the nearest package.json  file or by giving the worker the extension .mjs .      A Worker Is in Its Own Realm    When a worker is created, it ’ s put in a new realm: it has its own global environment, its own intrinsic  objects, etc. If the worker is a module, any modules it loads will be loaded within that realm, sepa- rately from modules loaded in other realms. For example, on a browser, if a module in the main win- dow loads mod1.js  and launches a worker that also loads mod1.js , mod1.js  is loaded twice: once in   362  ❘  CHAPTER 13    MODULES  the main window ’ s realm, and again in the worker ’ s realm. If the worker loads another module  say,  mod2.js   that also imports from  mod1.js , that other module and the worker module share a com- mon copy of mod1.js ; but they  don ’ t  share the copy the main window loads. See Figure   13-12  .  t  main realm  main.js  worker realm  worker.js  mod1.js  mod1.js  mod2.js   FIGURE 13-12         Worker realms are isolated not only from the main window ’ s realm but from each other as well, so  if you launch ten workers that all load mod1.js , it will be loaded ten times  once per worker . Since each worker is in its own realm, each has its own module tree.    This is true both on web browsers and Node.js.    OLD HABITS TO NEW    Here are a few old habits you might consider updating.    Use Modules Instead of Pseudo-Namespaces  Old habit : Using a “namespace” object to provide a single public symbol for your code  perhaps in a library, like jQuery ’ s $  global :  t      var MyLib =  function lib  {         function privateFunction   {              ...         }         lib.publicFunction = function   {                ...         };         return lib;     }  MyLib  {} ;       New habit : Use modules:  t      function privateFunction   {            ...   }     export function publicFunction   {          ...   }        Old Habits to New ❘ 363   Note: don ’ t export objects with properties methods that are meant to be used individually. Use named exports instead.      Use Modules Instead of Wrapping Code in Scoping Functions   Old habit : Using a “scoping function” around your code to avoid creating globals:  t       function   {         var x =  * ... * ;       function doSomething   {                ...         }            ...   }   ;           let x =  * ... * ;     function doSomething   {          ...   }        ...  New habit : Use modules, since the top-level scope of a module is not the global scope:  t    Use Modules to Avoid Creating Megalithic Code Files  Old habit : Having a single huge code file to avoid having to worry about combining smaller files for production.  But you didn ’ t have this habit, right? Right?    t  t  New habit : Use a variety of right-sized modules instead, with statically declared dependencies  between them. The question of what size is the right size will be a matter of style and something to agree with your team. Putting each function in its own module is probably overkill, but then, a single massive module exporting this, that, and the other is probably not modular enough.      Convert  CJS ,  AMD , and Other Modules to  ESM  Old habit : Using CJS, AMD, and other modules  because there was no native JavaScript mod- ule format .   t  New habit : Use ESM, converting your old modules  either in one big leap, or more likely slowly  t over time .      Use a Well-Maintained Bundler Rather Than Going Homebrew  Old habit : Any of several ad-hoc mechanisms for combining your individual files used for develop- ment into a combined file  or small set of files  for production.   t  New habit : Use a well-maintained, community-supported bundler.  t    Reflection—Reflect and Proxy  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ The Reflect object  ➤➤ Proxy objects  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode  or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter, you’ll learn about the Reflect object, which provides a host of useful utility  features for constructing and interacting with objects, and Proxy, which provides the ulti- mate façade pattern for JavaScript—a pattern that can be important for providing APIs to  client code.  Reflect and Proxy are designed to be used together, though each can be used without the  other. This chapter will briefly introduce Reflect, but then mostly cover it in the context of  covering Proxy.  REFLECT  Reflect was added in ES2015 with various methods corresponding to fundamental operations  that are performed on objects: getting and setting a property’s value, getting and setting the  object’s prototype, deleting a property from an object, etc.   366  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  Your first thought is probably: “Why do we need utility functions for that? We can already do those  things just using operators on the object directly.” That’s partly true, and in cases where it isn’t true,  there’s usually a function  or combination of functions  on Object that does the job; Reflect brings  a few things to the table, though:  ➤➤ It provides a thin wrapper function for all of the fundamental object operations, rather than   having some of them be syntax and others be Object functions or combinations of Object  functions. This means that you can pass fundamental object operations around, without  having to write your own wrapper around things like the in or delete operators.  ➤➤ Its functions provide return values for success failure in some cases where the equivalent   Object functions throw errors instead  more on that in a moment .  ➤➤ As you’ll learn in the section on proxies, it offers functions that perfectly match each “trap”   that a proxy object can hook into, implementing the default behavior for the trap, making  it simple to correctly implement traps that only modify behavior rather than replacing the  behavior entirely.  ➤➤ It provides an operation not available any other way outside of class syntax:    Reflect.construct with the newTarget argument.  Reflect and Object have several functions with the same names and, largely, the same purposes:  ➤➤ defineProperty ➤➤ getOwnPropertyDescriptor ➤➤ getPrototypeOf ➤➤ setPrototypeOf ➤➤ preventExtensions  They do fundamentally the same things, but there are slight differences between them:  ➤➤ In general, the Reflect version will throw an error if you pass it a non-object where it   expects an object, whereas the Object version will  in many but not all cases  either coerce  a primitive to an object and operate on the result, or just ignore the call.  The exception  is Object.defineProperty, which throws if you pass it a non-object, like Reflect  functions do.   ➤➤ In general, the Reflect version of a modification function returns a flag for success failure,  whereas the Object version returns the object you passed it to modify  and if you pass it a  primitive, either returns the object it coerced the primitive to, or just returns the primitive  as-is if the call does nothing on primitives . The Object version usually throws an error  on failure.  Separately, Reflect also has a function, ownKeys, which is superficially similar to Object.keys, but  has two significant differences you’ll learn about later.  While most of Reflect’s functions are primarily useful for implementing proxies, let’s look at some  that are useful on their own, too.   Reflect  ❘  367  Reflect.apply  Reflect.apply is a utility function that does what the apply method on functions does. It calls a  function with a specific this value and list of arguments, which is provided as an array  or array- like object :  function example a, b, c  {     console.log `this.name = ${this.name}, a = ${a}, b = ${b}, c = ${c}` ; }   const thisArg = {name: "test"}; const args = [1, 2, 3]; Reflect.apply example, thisArg, args ;    this.name = test, a = 1, b, = 2, c = 3  In that example, you could replace the call to Reflect.apply with a call to example.apply:  example.apply thisArg, args ;    this.name = test, a = 1, b, = 2, c = 3  However, Reflect.apply has a couple of advantages:  ➤➤ It works even if the apply property on example has been overridden or overwritten with   something other than Function.prototype.apply.  ➤➤ A slight variation on that: it works in the truly obscure case where the prototype of the   function has been changed  for instance, with Object.setPrototypeOf  so that the function  no longer inherits from Function.prototype, and so doesn’t have apply.  ➤➤ It works on anything callable  any object with a [[Call]] internal operation , even if it’s not   a genuine JavaScript function. There are fewer of these around than there used to be, but  not all that long ago host-provided “functions” often weren’t real JavaScript functions and  didn’t have apply and such.  There still are some.   Reflect.construct  Reflect.construct creates a new instance via a constructor function, like the new operator does.  However, Reflect.construct offers two features new doesn’t:  ➤➤ It accepts the arguments for the constructor as an array  or array-like object . ➤➤ It lets you set new.target to something other than the function you’re calling.  Let’s look at the arguments aspect first, since it’s quite simple. Suppose you have the arguments you  want to use with a constructor  Thing  in an array. In ES5, it was awkward to call the constructor  with arguments from an array. The simplest way was to create the object yourself, and then call the  constructor as a plain function via apply:     In ES5 var o = Thing.apply Object.create Thing.prototype , theArguments ;  That works in ES5 provided Thing uses the this it was called with  which is the normal thing to do   rather than creating its own object.   368  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  In ES2015+ you have two ways to do it, spread syntax and Reflect.construct:     In ES2015+ let o = new Thing ...theArguments ;    or let o = Reflect.construct Thing, theArguments ;  Since spread syntax goes through an iterator, it does more work than Reflect.construct,   which accesses the length, 0, 1, etc. properties of the arguments “array” directly  not that   that usually matters . That means spread works with non-array–like iterable objects, where   Reflect.construct doesn’t; and Reflect.construct works with array-like, non-iterable objects,  where spread doesn’t.  The second thing Reflect.construct provides that new doesn’t, controlling new.target, is   primarily useful when using Reflect with a proxy  more in a later section , but can also be used to  create instances that are subtypes of built-ins like Error or Array  which notoriously can’t be cor- rectly subclassed using only ES5 features  without using class syntax. Some programmers don’t like  to use class or new, preferring to create objects in other ways. But they may still want to create their  own instances of Error or Array or HTMLElement  for web components  that have a different   prototype  with their own additional features . If you don’t want to use class and new for that,  Reflect.construct is the way you’d go:     Defining the function that builds custom errors function buildCustomError ...args  {     return Reflect.construct Error, args, buildCustomError ; } buildCustomError.prototype = Object.assign Object.create Error.prototype , {     constructor: buildCustomError,     report   {         console.log `this.message = ${this.message}` ;     } } ;      Using it const e = buildCustomError "error message here" ; console.log "instanceof Error", e instanceof Error ; e.report  ; console.log e ;  The highlighted line calls Error but passes in buildCustomError for the new.target parameter,  which means that buildCustomError.prototype gets assigned to the newly created object, rather  than Error.prototype. The resulting instance inherits the custom report method.  Reflect.ownKeys  The Reflect.ownKeys function is superficially similar to Object.keys, but returns an   array of all of the object’s own property keys, including non-enumerable ones and ones named   with Symbols rather than strings. Despite the similarity of names, it’s more like a combination   of Object.getOwnPropertyNames and Object.getOwnPropertySymbols than it is like  Object.keys.   Reflect  ❘  369  Reflect.get, Reflect.set  These functions get and set properties on an object, but with a handy feature: if the property being  accessed is an accessor property, you can control what this is within the call to the accessor. In effect,  they’re the accessor property version of Reflect.apply.  Setting this to a different object than the one you get the property accessor from may seem like  an odd thing to do, but if you think about it, you’ve already seen something that does that, back in  Chapter 4: super. Consider this base class that calculates the product of its construction parameters,  and a subclass that takes that result and doubles it:  class Product {     constructor x, y  {         this.x = x;         this.y = y;     }     get result   {         return this.x * this.y;     } } class DoubleProduct extends Product {     get result   {         return super.result * 2;     } }   const d = new DoubleProduct 10, 2 ; console.log d.result ;             40  DoubleProduct’s result accessor needs to use super.result to run the result accessor from  Product, not DoubleProduct, because if it used the version from DoubleProduct, it would call itself  recursively and cause a stack overflow. But when calling the Product version of the result accessor,  it has to make sure this is set to the instance  d1  so that the correct values for x and y get used.   The object it gets the accessor from  Product.prototype, the prototype of the prototype of d1    and the object that should be this within the call to the accessor  d1  are different objects.  If you needed to do that without super, you’d use Reflect.get. Without Reflect.get, you’d   have to get the property descriptor for result and call its get method via get.call apply or  Reflect.apply, which is awkward:  get result   {     const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf Object.getPrototypeOf this  ;     const descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor proto, "result" ;     const superResult = descriptor.get.call this ;     return superResult * 2; }  It’s much simpler with Reflect.get:  get result   {     const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf Object.getPrototypeOf this  ;     return Reflect.get proto, "result", this  * 2; }   370  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  Of course, you don’t have to do that in this specific case because you have super. Reflect.get lets  you handle situations where you don’t have super  for instance, in a Proxy handler as you’ll learn  later  or where super isn’t applicable.  Reflect.get has this signature:  value = Reflect.get target, propertyName[, receiver] ;  ➤➤ target is the object to get the property from. ➤➤ propertyName is the name of the property to get. ➤➤ receiver is the optional object to use as this during the accessor call, if the property is an   accessor property.  It returns the property’s value.  Reflect.get gets the property descriptor for propertyName from target, and, if the descrip- tor is for a data property, returns the value of that property. But if the descriptor is for an acces- sor, Reflect.get calls the accessor function using receiver as this  like the earlier “awkward”  code did .  Reflect.set works the same way as Reflect.get, just setting the property rather than getting it. It  has this signature:  result = Reflect.set target, propertyName, value[, receiver] ;  target, propertyName, and receiver are all the same; value is the value to set. The function  returns true if the value was set, false if not.  Both are particularly handy with proxies, as you’ll learn later in this chapter.

When creating the proxy, you can define handlers for one or more traps for the operation s  to  handle, such as getting a property’s value or defining a new property.  There are a lot of use cases for proxies:  ➤➤ Logging the operations that occur on an object ➤➤ Making reading writing non-existent properties an error  rather than returning undefined   or creating the property   ➤➤ Providing a boundary between two bits of code  such as an API and the consumer of it  ➤➤ Creating read-only views of mutable objects ➤➤ Hiding information in an object, or making it seem as though an object has more   information than it actually does  . . . and many more. Since proxies let you hook into and  in most cases  modify the fundamental  operations, there are very few limits on what you can do with them.  Let’s look at a simple example; see Listing 14-1.  LISTING 14-1:  Initial Proxy example—initial-proxy-example.js  const obj = {     testing: "abc" }; const p = new Proxy obj, {     get target, name, receiver  {         console.log ` getting property '${name}' ` ;         return Reflect.get target, name, receiver ;     } } ;    continues   372  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  LISTING 14-1   continued   console.log "Getting 'testing' directly..." ; console.log `Got ${obj.testing}` ; console.log "Getting 'testing' via proxy..." ; console.log `Got ${p.testing}` ; console.log "Getting non-existent property 'foo' via proxy..." ; console.log `Got ${p.foo}` ;  The code in Listing 14-1 creates a proxy, defining a handler for the get trap  getting a property’s  value . When you run that, you see  Getting 'testing' directly... Got abc Getting 'testing' via proxy...  getting property 'testing'  Got abc Getting non-existent property 'foo' via proxy...  getting property 'foo'  Got undefined  There are a few things to notice there:  ➤➤ To create the proxy, you pass the Proxy constructor the target object and an object with   trap handlers. The example defines one trap handler: for the get operation.  ➤➤ Operations performed directly on the target object do not trigger the proxy, only operations  performed through the proxy do. Notice there’s no “ getting property 'testing' ” mes- sage between “Getting 'testing' directly...” and “Got abc.”  ➤➤ The get trap isn’t specific to one single property: all property accesses on the proxy go   through it, even for properties that don’t exist, such as foo at the end of the example.  Even if proxies could do no more than just listen in on fundamental operations, they’d be hugely use- ful, but they can also change the result of the operation, or even suppress the operation entirely. In the  previous example, the handler returned the underlying object’s value from the handler unchanged, but  it could have modified it. Run Listing 14-2 to see an example of doing that.  LISTING 14-2:  Simple Proxy example with modification—simple-mod-proxy-example.js  const obj = {     testing: "abc" }; const p = new Proxy obj, {     get target, name, receiver  {         console.log ` getting property '${name}' ` ;         let value = Reflect.get target, name, receiver ;         if  value && typeof value.toUpperCase === "function"  {             value = value.toUpperCase  ;         }         return value;     } } ;     Proxy  ❘  373  In the Listing 14-2 example, the handler modifies the value before returning it  if it has a   toUpperCase method , resulting in this output:  console.log "Getting directly..." ; console.log `Got ${obj.testing}` ; console.log "Getting via proxy..." ; console.log `Got ${p.testing}` ;  Getting directly... Got abc Getting via proxy...  getting property 'testing'  Got ABC  There’s a proxy trap for every fundamental object operation; handlers for the traps can do almost  anything  you’ll learn about some limits in a bit . See Table 14-2  overleaf  for a list of the trap names  and the fundamental operation they trap  the names are the names of the fundamental operations in  the specification . We’ll look at the traps more closely once we get the basics out of the way.  ES2015 originally defined a 14th trap, enumerate, which was triggered by the initialization of a   for-in loop on the proxy  and by a corresponding Reflect.enumerate function , but it was  removed in ES2016 because of performance and observability issues raised by JavaScript engine  implementers: when they got into the details of implementing it, it turned out it could be efficient  and have observable side effects  e.g., you could tell whether you were dealing with a proxy or a  non-proxy , or it could be inefficient.  This is an example of why the new enhancement process you  learned about in Chapter 1 is a good idea; something doesn’t make it into the specification until there  are multiple implementations, to shake out this kind of problem before a feature lands in the spec.   If you don’t specify a handler for a trap, the proxy forwards the operation to its target object directly.  That’s why the code in Listing 14-2 only needed to define the get trap handler.  We’ll go into the details of each trap later in the chapter, but let’s start with an example of one  proxy use case demonstrating all of the traps: a proxy that logs all of the fundamental operations on  an object.  Example: Logging Proxy  In this section you’ll see a logging proxy, logging all of the fundamental operations that occur on an  object. The example says what trap was called and shows the parameter values it was called with. All  the code in this example is in the downloads  logging-proxy.js , which you should run locally to  see the results, but let’s go through it in parts.  To make the output clearer, we’ll keep track of names for objects and then when outputting a log  message that says that object was the value of a parameter, we’ll use its name rather than showing  the object’s contents.  There’s another reason this example does that: when the object we need to log  is the proxy object, logging its contents would trigger proxy traps, and in the case of some of those  traps, it would cause recursion leading to a stack overflow.    374  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy   Proxy  ❘  375  The code starts off with the log function that does the logging:  const names = new WeakMap  ; function log label, params  {     console.log label + ": " + Object.getOwnPropertyNames params .map key => {         const value = params[key];         const name = names.get value ;         const display = name ? name : JSON.stringify value ;         return `${key} = ${display}`;     } .join ", "  ; }  The names map is what the code uses to keep track of names for objects. So for instance, this code:  const example = {"answer": 42}; names.set example, "example" ; log "Testing 1 2 3", {value: example} ;  would output the name “example” rather than the contents of the object:  Testing 1 2 3: value = example  After the log function, the code continues by defining a handlers object with handler functions for  all the traps:  const handlers = {     apply target, thisValue, args  {         log "apply", {target, thisValue, args} ;         return Reflect.apply target, thisValue, args ;     },     construct target, args, newTarget  {         log "construct", {target, args, newTarget} ;         return Reflect.construct target, args, newTarget ;     },     defineProperty target, propName, descriptor  {         log "defineProperty", {target, propName, descriptor} ;         return Reflect.defineProperty target, propName, descriptor ;     },     deleteProperty target, propName  {         log "deleteProperty", {target, propName} ;         return Reflect.deleteProperty target, propName ;     },     get target, propName, receiver  {         log "get", {target, propName, receiver} ;         return Reflect.get target, propName, receiver ;     },     getOwnPropertyDescriptor target, propName  {         log "getOwnPropertyDescriptor", {target, propName} ;         return Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor target, propName ;     },     getPrototypeOf target  {         log "getPrototypeOf", {target} ;         return Reflect.getPrototypeOf target ;     },   376  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy      has target, propName  {         log "has", {target, propName} ;         return Reflect.has target, propName ;     },     isExtensible target  {         log "isExtensible", {target} ;         return Reflect.isExtensible target ;     },     ownKeys target  {         log "ownKeys", {target} ;         return Reflect.ownKeys target ;     },     preventExtensions target  {         log "preventExtensions", {target} ;         return Reflect.preventExtensions target ;     },     set target, propName, value, receiver  {         log "set", {target, propName, value, receiver} ;         return Reflect.set target, propName, value, receiver ;     },     setPrototypeOf target, newProto  {         log "setPrototypeOf", {target, newProto} ;         return Reflect.setPrototypeOf target, newProto ;     } };  The definition is done in this verbose way in the example both for clarity and so that log can show  names for the parameter values the trap handlers receive.  If we didn’t want to do that, we could  hook things up in a simple loop since Reflect has methods whose names are the same as proxy traps  and that expect exactly the arguments the traps provide.   Next, the code defines a simple counter class:  class Counter {     constructor name  {         this.value = 0;         this.name = name;     }     increment   {         return ++this.value;     } }  const c = new Counter "counter" ; const cProxy = new Proxy c, handlers ; names.set c, "c" ; names.set cProxy, "cProxy" ;  Then it creates an instance of the class, wraps a proxy around it, and saves those two objects in the  names map:  Now the code starts doing operations on the proxy, triggering traps. First, it gets the initial value of  the counter through the proxy:  console.log "---- Getting cProxy.value  before increment :" ; console.log `cProxy.value  before  = ${cProxy.value}` ;   Proxy  ❘  377  You’ve already seen a get proxy trap, so you won’t be surprised by the output:  ---- Getting cProxy.value  before increment : get: target = c, propName = "value", receiver = cProxy cProxy.value  before  = 0  The second line shows us that the get trap was triggered with target set to the target object c,   propName set to "value", and the receiver object, receiver, set to the proxy itself, cProxy.  You’ll  learn about the significance of the receiver object in a later section.  The third line shows us that the  value returned was 0, which makes sense as the counter starts out at 0.  Next, the code calls the increment function on the proxy:  console.log "---- Calling cProxy.increment  :" ; cProxy.increment  ;  The output for this may seem a bit more surprising:  ---- Calling cProxy.increment  : get: target = c, propName = "increment", receiver = cProxy get: target = c, propName = "value", receiver = cProxy set: target = c, propName = "value", value = 1, receiver = cProxy getOwnPropertyDescriptor: target = c, propName = "value" defineProperty: target = c, propName = "value", descriptor = {"value":1}  Four different types of traps were triggered, one of them twice!  The first part is simple enough: cProxy.increment   does a [[Get]] to look up the increment  property on the proxy, so we see the get trap fired for that. Then, remember the implementation of  increment:      increment   {         return ++this.value;     }  In the expression cProxy.increment  , this within the call to increment is set to cProxy, so this  in ++this.value is the proxy: first the engine does a [[Get]] on value  getting 0 , then a [[Set]] on  value  setting 1 .  You’re probably thinking, “So far so good, but what’s that getOwnPropertyDescriptor doing there?  And why defineProperty?!”  The implementation of the default [[Set]] operation for ordinary objects1 is designed this way specifi- cally to allow for proxies. First it checks to see if the property is a data property or an accessor  this  check is done directly, without going through the proxy.  If the property being set is an accessor, the  setter function is called. But if it’s a data property, the property’s value is set by getting the property’s  descriptor through the proxy via [[GetOwnProperty]], setting its value, and then using [[DefineOwn- Property]] with the modified descriptor to update it.  If the property doesn’t exist yet, [[Set]] defines a  data property descriptor for the property and uses [[DefineOwnProperty]] to create it.     1 https:  tc39.es ecma262 sec-ordinaryset   378  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  It may seem odd to use [[DefineOwnProperty]] to set the value, but doing so ensures that all opera- tions that modify a property  its writability, configurability, extensibility, or indeed its value  go  through a central operation: [[DefineOwnProperty]].  You’ll see the others as we continue through  the example.   The code continues with:  console.log "---- Getting cProxy.value  after increment :" ; console.log `cProxy.value  after  = ${cProxy.value}` ;  which shows the updated value:  ---- Getting cProxy.value  after increment : get: target = c, propName = "value", receiver = cProxy cProxy.value  after  = 1  So far, the example has triggered four of the thirteen traps: get, set, getOwnPropertyDescriptor,  and defineProperty.  Next, the code uses Object.keys to get cProxy’s own, enumerable string-named property keys:  console.log "---- Getting cProxy's own enumerable string-named keys:" ; console.log Object.keys cProxy  ;  This triggers the ownKeys trap, and then since Object.keys has to check whether the keys are enu- merable before including them in the array, we see it get the property descriptors for both of the keys  it returns:  ---- Getting cProxy's own enumerable string-named keys: ownKeys: target = c getOwnPropertyDescriptor: target = c, propName = "value" getOwnPropertyDescriptor: target = c, propName = "name" ["value", "name"]  Next, the code deletes the value property:  console.log "---- Deleting cProxy.value:" ; delete cProxy.value;  The operation to delete a property is straightforward, so just the deleteProperty trap is triggered:  ---- Deleting cProxy.value: deleteProperty: target = c, propName = "value"  Then it checks to see if the value property still exists, using the in operator:  console.log "---- Checking whether cProxy has a 'value' property:" ; console.log `"value" in cProxy? ${"value" in cProxy}` ;  That triggers the has trap. Since the proxy didn’t prevent the deletion a moment ago, the object  doesn’t have the value property anymore:  ---- Checking whether cProxy has a 'value' property: has: target = c, propName = "value" "value" in cProxy? false   Proxy  ❘  379  Next, the code gets the prototype of the object:  console.log "---- Getting the prototype of cProxy:" ; const sameProto = Object.getPrototypeOf cProxy  === Counter.prototype; console.log `Object.getPrototypeOf cProxy  === Counter.prototype? ${sameProto}` ;  That triggers the getPrototypeOf trap:  ---- Getting the prototype of cProxy: getPrototypeOf: target = c Object.getPrototypeOf cProxy  === Counter.prototype? true  Remember, proxies pass through operations to their targets  unless a trap handler intervenes , so it’s  c’s prototype, not the proxy’s, that gets returned.  In fact, since proxies behave this way, they don’t get  a prototype assigned to them at all, and the Proxy constructor has no prototype property.   To trigger the next trap, the code sets the object’s prototype:  console.log "---- Setting the prototype of cProxy to Object.prototype:" ; Object.setPrototypeOf cProxy, Object.prototype ;  And indeed, the setPrototypeOf trap handler is triggered:  ---- Setting the prototype of cProxy to Object.prototype: setPrototypeOf: target = c, newProto = {}  Then it checks to see if cProxy’s prototype is still Counter.prototype:  console.log "---- Getting the prototype of cProxy again:" ; const sameProto2 = Object.getPrototypeOf cProxy  === Counter.prototype; console.log `Object.getPrototypeOf cProxy  === Counter.prototype? ${sameProto2}` ;  It isn’t, because the code just changed it to Object.prototype a moment ago:  ---- Getting the prototype of cProxy again: getPrototypeOf: target = c Object.getPrototypeOf cProxy  === Counter.prototype? false  Next, the code checks for extensibility:  console.log "---- Is cProxy extensible?:" ; console.log `Object.isExtensible cProxy   before ? ${Object.isExtensible cProxy }` ;  An extensibility check is a really straightforward operation; just a single call to the isExtensible  trap handler is involved:  ---- Is cProxy extensible?: isExtensible: target = c Object.isExtensible cProxy   before ? true  Next, the code prevents extensions:  console.log "---- Preventing extensions on cProxy:" ; Object.preventExtensions cProxy ;  firing the preventExtensions trap:  ---- Preventing extensions on cProxy: preventExtensions: target = c   380  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  Then it checks to see if the object is still extensible:  console.log "---- Is cProxy still extensible?:" ; console.log `Object.isExtensible cProxy   after ? ${Object.isExtensible cProxy }` ;  which it isn’t anymore, since the trap didn’t prevent the operation:  ---- Is cProxy still extensible?: isExtensible: target = c Object.isExtensible cProxy   after ? false  So far, you’ve seen 11 of the 13 traps. The remaining two are traps that only make sense for proxies  on function objects, so the example code creates a function and wraps a proxy around it  and regis- ters those in names so it knows to log their names rather than contents :  const func = function   { console.log "func ran" ; }; const funcProxy = new Proxy func, handlers ; names.set func, "func" ; names.set funcProxy, "funcProxy" ;  Then it calls the function:  console.log "---- Calling funcProxy as a function:" ; funcProxy  ;  which triggers the apply trap handler:  ---- Calling funcProxy as a function: apply: target = func, thisValue = undefined, args = [] func ran  And then it demonstrates the last trap, construct, by calling the function as a constructor:  console.log "---- Calling funcProxy as a constructor:" ; new funcProxy  ;  resulting in:  ---- Calling funcProxy as a constructor: construct: target = func, args = [], newTarget = funcProxy get: target = func, propName = "prototype", receiver = funcProxy func ran  That works, since traditional functions can all be used as constructors. But if you tried to call a non- constructor such as an arrow function or a method that way, the trap wouldn’t be triggered because  the proxy won’t have a [[Construct]] internal function at all; instead, the attempt just fails. The exam- ple goes on to demonstrate that by creating an arrow function and a proxy for it:  const arrowFunc =    => { console.log "arrowFunc ran" ; }; const arrowFuncProxy = new Proxy arrowFunc, handlers ; names.set arrowFunc, "arrowFunc" ; names.set arrowFuncProxy, "arrowFuncProxy" ;  and then trying to call it as a function and as a constructor:  console.log "---- Calling arrowFuncProxy as a function:" ; arrowFuncProxy  ; console.log "---- Calling arrowFuncProxy as a constructor:" ;   Proxy  ❘  381  try {     new arrowFuncProxy  ; } catch  error  {     console.error `${error.name}: ${error.message}` ; }  which results in:  ---- Calling arrowFuncProxy as a function: apply: target = arrowFunc, thisValue = undefined, args = [] arrowFunc ran ---- Calling arrowFuncProxy as a constructor: TypeError: arrowFuncProxy is not a constructor  Finally, just for emphasis, remember that functions are objects, so all of the other traps apply to them  as well. The example ends by getting the arrow function’s name property:  console.log "---- Getting name of arrowFuncProxy:" ; console.log `arrowFuncProxy.name = ${arrowFuncProxy.name}` ;  which triggers the get trap:  ---- Getting name of arrowFuncProxy: get: target = arrowFunc, propName = "name", receiver = arrowFuncProxy arrowFuncProxy.name = arrowFunc  Proxy Traps  Common Features  You’ve seen all of the traps in action in the logging example. This section will go into detail on each  trap, including any limitations on it.  In general, the handler for a proxy trap can do nearly anything it likes, though some have some limits.  In general, a trap handler can:  ➤➤ Handle the operation itself, never touching the target object function ➤➤ Adjust the operation  sometimes only within limits  ➤➤ Reject the operation, returning an error flag or throwing an error ➤➤ Perform any side effects you like  such as the logging statements in the logging example ,   since a trap handler is arbitrary code  Where trap handlers have limits, they’re there to enforce the essential invariant behavior2 that is  expected of all objects, even exotic ones like proxies. Limits of specific traps are called out in the fol- lowing sections.  The apply Trap  The apply trap is for the [[Call]] internal operation on callable objects  like functions . A proxy will  only have a [[Call]] operation if the target object it’s proxying has one  otherwise, trying to call the   2 https:  tc39.github.io ecma262 sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods   382  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  proxy will yield a type error because it’s not callable , so the apply trap only applies to proxies whose  target is callable.  The apply trap handler receives three arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ thisValue: The value used as this when making the call ➤➤ args: An array of the arguments for the call  Its return value is used as the return value of the call operation  whether or not it actually did call the  target function .  The trap handler can make the underlying call, or not, and can return any value you like  or throw an  error . Unlike some other trap handlers, there are no limits on what the apply handler can do.  The construct Trap  The construct trap is for the [[Construct]] internal operation of constructors. A proxy will only  have a [[Construct]] operation if the target object it’s proxying has one  otherwise, trying to call the  proxy as a constructor will yield a type error because it’s not one , so the construct trap only applies  to proxies whose target is a constructor  either a class constructor or a traditional function, which  can be used as a constructor .  The construct trap receives three arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ args: An array of the arguments for the call ➤➤ newTarget: The value for new.target  which you learned about in Chapter 4   Its return value is used as the result of the construction operation  whether it actually did one or not .  It can do almost anything it likes. The one restriction on a construct trap handler is that if it returns  something  rather than throwing an error , that something must be an object  not null or a primi- tive . If it returns null or a primitive, the proxy throws an error.  The defineProperty Trap  The defineProperty trap is for the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal object operation. As you   saw in the logging example, [[DefineOwnProperty]] isn’t only used when something calls   Object.defineProperty  or Reflect.defineProperty  on an object, it’s also used when a   data property’s value is set, or when a property is created via assignment.  The defineProperty trap receives three arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ propName: The name of the property to define redefine ➤➤ descriptor: The descriptor to apply   Proxy  ❘  383  It’s expected to return true on success  the property definition was successful or already matched the  existing property  or false on error.  Truthy and falsy values will be coerced as necessary.   The trap handler can reject the change  either returning false or throwing an error , adjust the prop- erty descriptor before applying it, etc., or any of the other things all traps can do.  If the trap handler returns true  success , there are some limits on it. Fundamentally, it can’t lie by  saying the operation succeeded when it’s observable that the operation wasn’t done. Specifically, an  error is thrown if it reports success and, when the handler returns, the property:  ➤➤ . . . doesn’t exist and the target isn’t extensible. ➤➤ . . . doesn’t exist and the descriptor was marking the property non-configurable. ➤➤ . . . exists and is configurable, but the descriptor was marking the property non-configurable. ➤➤ . . . exists and applying the descriptor to it would throw an error  for instance, if the prop-  erty exists and is non-configurable, but the descriptor was changing its configuration .  Those rules are there because of the essential invariant behavior constraints on objects mentioned  earlier. They still leave a lot of flexibility, though. For instance, the trap can say that a call to set the  value of the property worked when the property’s value isn’t  now  the value that was supposedly set,  even though it’s a writable data property.  There are no limits on the trap handler when it returns false  failure , even if the property exists  exactly as the descriptor describes it  which would normally mean it would return true .  As you learned earlier, the defineProperty trap is triggered when setting the value of a data   property  as opposed to an accessor property , but that doesn’t make the set trap redundant.   The set trap is triggered when setting the value of accessor properties as well, whereas   defineProperty is not.  Listing 14-3 shows a simple defineProperty trap that forbids making any existing property on the  target non-writable.

Can you think why it’s written  that way? It’s to do with one of the main differences between the Object and Reflect versions of  functions that change things . . .  It’s because I wanted to show you the false result, and the fact that the a property was still writ- able after the defineProperty call. If I’d used Object.defineProperty, it would have thrown an  error rather than returning false, so I would have had to write a try catch block. Which you use  in this sort of situation depends on whether you want a return value or an error; there are uses for  both calls.  One final note: if the trap was triggered by a call to defineProperty  either the version on Object  or on Reflect , the trap does not receive a direct reference to the descriptor object passed into that  function; instead, it receives an object created specifically for the trap, which has only valid property  names on it. So even if extra, non-descriptor properties were included on the one passed to the func- tion, the trap would not receive them.  The deleteProperty Trap  The deleteProperty trap is for the [[Delete]] internal object operation that removes a property from  an object.  The deleteProperty trap handler receives two arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ propName: The name of the property to delete  It’s expected to return true on success and false on error, just like the delete operator does in  loose mode  in strict mode, a failed delete throws an error . Truthy and falsy values will be coerced  as necessary.  The handler can refuse to delete the property  returning false or throwing an error , or any of the  other things all traps can do.  It can’t return true if the property exists on the target and is non-configurable, as that would violate  one of the essential invariants. Doing so causes an error to be thrown.  Listing 14-4 shows a deleteProperty trap that refuses to delete the value property.   Proxy  ❘  385  LISTING 14-4:  deleteProperty trap example—deleteProperty-trap-example.js  const obj = {value: 42}; const p = new Proxy obj, {     deleteProperty target, propName, descriptor  {         if  propName === "value"  {             return false;         }         return Reflect.deleteProperty target, propName, descriptor ;     } } ; console.log `p.value = ${p.value}` ; console.log "deleting 'value' from p in loose mode:" ; console.log delete p.value ;    false     => {     "use strict";     console.log "deleting 'value' from p in strict mode:" ;     try {         delete p.value;     } catch  error  {            TypeError: 'deleteProperty' on proxy: trap returned            falsish for property 'value'         console.error error ;     } }   ;  The get Trap  As you’ll recall, the get trap is for the [[Get]] internal object operation: getting the value of  a property.  The get trap handler receives three arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ propName: The property name ➤➤ receiver: The object that received the [[Get]] call  Its return value is used as the result of the [[Get]] operation  the value the code accessing the property  sees for its value .  The receiver property is significant when the property is an accessor property, not a data property:  it’s the value that would be this during the call to the accessor if there were no trap handler. Often,  receiver is the proxy, but receiver could be an object using the proxy as a prototype—proxies are  objects, after all, and nothing prevents using a proxy as a prototype. Depending on your use case, if  passing the call on to Reflect.get, you might choose not to pass on the receiver, so this within the  accessor is the target, or you might substitute a different target, etc.   386  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  A get trap can do almost anything it likes, modifying the value, etc., except that like other traps it  can’t violate certain essential invariants, which means an error is thrown if it:  ➤➤ . . . returns a value that isn’t the same as the value of the underlying target’s property, if that   property is a non-configurable, read-only data property.  ➤➤ . . . returns a value other than undefined if the target’s property is a non-configurable   write-only accessor  has no getter, just a setter .  You’ve already seen several examples of get; there’s no need to do another here. But get does show  up again later in the “Example: Hiding Properties” section.  The getOwnPropertyDescriptor Trap  The getOwnPropertyDescriptor trap is for the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal object operation,  which gets a descriptor object for the property from the object. As you learned during the log- ging example earlier, [[GetOwnProperty]] is called in a number of places during the processing of  other internal object operations, not just when code uses Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor or  Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor.  The getOwnPropertyDescriptor trap handler receives two arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ propName: The name of the property  It’s expected to return a property descriptor object, or undefined if the property doesn’t exist; return- ing anything else  including null  will cause an error. Normally you’d get the descriptor object from  Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor, but you can also hand-craft the descriptor object or modify  what you get back from that call  within limits . Here’s a list of the properties of a property descrip- tor object, which are used in various combinations depending on the property:  ➤➤ writable: true if the property is writable, false if not  data properties only, not accessor   properties ; default false if absent  ➤➤ enumerable: true if the property is enumerable, false if not; default false if absent ➤➤ configurable: true if the property is configurable, false if not; default false if absent ➤➤ value: The value of the property, if it’s a data property; absent otherwise ➤➤ get: The getter function for an accessor property  can’t be combined with value   ➤➤ set: The setter function for an accessor property  can’t be combined with value   or writable   or writable   The descriptor object returned by the trap is not returned directly to the code requesting the   descriptor; instead, a new descriptor object is created, taking only valid properties from the one   provided. Any other properties are silently ignored.   Proxy  ❘  387  This trap has some limits on what it can do in order to maintain essential invariants. An error is  thrown if:  ➤➤ . . . the handler returns undefined and the target object has the property and the target is   ➤➤ . . . the handler returns undefined and the target object has the property and the property   ➤➤ . . . the handler returns a descriptor for a non-configurable property, but the property either   ➤➤ . . . the handler returns a descriptor for the property, but the property doesn’t exist, and the   not extensible.  is non-configurable.  doesn’t exist or is configurable.  target is non-extensible.  The primary use case of the getOwnPropertyDescriptor trap is probably hiding a property that the  target has from code using the proxy. Doing so is non-trivial and involves handlers for several traps,  however. See the “Example: Hiding Properties” section later in this chapter.  The getPrototypeOf Trap  The getPrototypeOf trap is for the [[GetPrototypeOf]] internal object operation. This is triggered  when the Object or Reflect object’s getPrototypeOf function is used  directly, or indirectly via the  Object.prototype.__proto__ getter on web browsers , or when any internal operation needs to  get the prototype of the proxy. It is not called when [[Get]] is used on the proxy, even if the prototype  chain is followed because the proxy doesn’t have the property, because the [[Get]] call is forwarded  to the target  in the normal case  and so the [[GetPrototypeOf]] operation used when following the  prototype chain at that point is called on the target, not the proxy.  It receives just the one argument:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target  It’s expected to return an object or null. It can return any object you want unless the target is non- extensible; in that case, you must return the target’s prototype.  Listing 14-5 shows a proxy that hides the prototype of the target, even though the prototype is used  for property resolution.  LISTING 14-5:  getPrototypeOf trap example—getPrototypeOf-trap-example.js  const proto = {     testing: "one two three" }; const obj = Object.create proto ; const p = new Proxy obj, {     getPrototypeOf target  {         return null;     } } ; console.log p.testing ;                   one two three console.log Object.getPrototypeOf p  ;    null   388  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  The has Trap  The has trap is for the [[HasProperty]] internal object operation, which determines if the object has  the given property  itself, or via its prototype .  It receives two arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ propName: The name of the property  It’s expected to return true if it has it  directly, or via its prototype  or false if not  truthy and falsy  values are coerced .  You can probably guess, based on the limits of previous traps, what the limits are for the has trap:  ➤➤ Returning false for a property that exists and is non-configurable throws an error. ➤➤ Returning false for a property that exists on a target object that is non-extensible   throws an error.  The handler is allowed to return true for a property that doesn’t exist, even on a non-extensible  target object.  The obvious things to do with has traps are hiding properties the object has or claiming the object  has properties it doesn’t. See the “Example: Hiding Properties” section later in this chapter for  an example.  The isExtensible Trap  The isExtensible trap is for the [[IsExtensible]] internal object operation: checking if the object is  extensible  that is, has not had the [[PreventExtensions]] operation performed on it .  The isExtensible trap handler receives just one argument:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target  It’s expected to return true if the object is extensible or false if not  truthy and falsy values are  coerced . This is one of the most restricted traps: it must return the same value that the target object  itself would have returned. Consequently, this trap is only useful for side effects, such as logging, as  you saw in the earlier example.  The ownKeys Trap  The ownKeys trap is for the [[OwnPropertyKeys]] internal object operation, which creates an array  of the object’s own property keys, including non-enumerable ones and ones named with Symbols  rather than strings.  The ownKeys trap handler receives just one argument:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target  It’s expected to return an array or array-like object  it can’t just return an iterable, it must be  array-like .   Proxy  ❘  389  An error is thrown if the trap handler returns an array that:  ➤➤ . . . has duplicates in it ➤➤ . . . has any non-string, non-Symbol entries ➤➤ . . . has any missing or extra entries, if the target object is non-extensible ➤➤ . . . is missing an entry for a non-configurable property that exists on the target  This means the handler can hide properties  as long as they’re configurable and the target is extensi- ble , or include extra properties  as long as the target is extensible .  One common use case for ownKeys is hiding properties, as you’ll see in the “Example: Hiding Proper- ties” example.  The preventExtensions Trap  The preventExtensions trap is for the [[PreventExtensions]] internal object operation, which marks  the object non-extensible.  Its handler receives just one argument:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target  It’s expected to return true on success or false on error  truthy and falsy values are coerced . It’s an  error if it returns true but the target object is extensible, but it is allowed to return false when the  target is non-extensible.  The trap handler can prevent the target from becoming non-extensible, by returning false as in  Listing 14-6.  LISTING 14-6:  preventExtensions trap example—preventExtensions-trap-example.js  const obj = {}; const p = new Proxy obj, {     preventExtensions target  {         return false;     } } ; console.log Reflect.isExtensible p  ;         true console.log Reflect.preventExtensions p  ;    false console.log Reflect.isExtensible p  ;         true  The set Trap  The set trap is for the [[Set]] internal object operation: setting the value of a property. It’s triggered  when either a data property or accessor property’s value is being set. As you learned earlier, if the trap  handler allows the operation and the property being set is a data property, the defineProperty trap  will also be triggered to set the data property’s value.   390  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  The set trap handler receives four arguments:  ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ propName: The name of the property ➤➤ value: The value to set ➤➤ receiver: The object receiving the operation  It’s expected to return true on success or false on error  truthy and falsy values are coerced . The  essential invariant operations constraints mean it’s an error if the handler returns true and:  ➤➤ . . . the property exists on the target object, is a non-configurable, non-writable data prop-  erty, and its value doesn’t match the value being set.  ➤➤ . . . the property exists on the target object, is a non-configurable accessor property, and has   no setter function.  Note that set can prevent setting values, even on non-configurable properties and even on non- extensible target objects, by returning false. You’ll see an example of that in the “Example: Hiding  Properties” section later in this chapter.  The setPrototypeOf Trap  The setPrototypeOf trap is for the [[SetPrototypeOf]] internal object operation, which  and I know  this will surprise you  sets the prototype of the object.  Its handler receives two arguments: ➤➤ target: The proxy’s target ➤➤ newProto: The prototype to set  It’s expected to return true on success or false on error  truthy and falsy values are coerced . To  enforce the essential invariants, it can’t return true if the target is non-extensible unless the prototype  being set is already the prototype of the target. It can, however, refuse to set a new prototype, as in  Listing 14-7.  LISTING 14-7:  setPrototypeOf trap example—setPrototypeOf-trap-example.js  const obj = {foo: 42}; const p = new Proxy obj, {     setPrototypeOf target, newProto  {            Return false unless `newProto` is already `target`'s prototype         return Reflect.getPrototypeOf target  === newProto;     } } ; console.log Reflect.getPrototypeOf p  === Object.prototype ;    true console.log Reflect.setPrototypeOf p, Object.prototype  ;       true console.log Reflect.setPrototypeOf p, Array.prototype  ;        false   Proxy  ❘  391  Example: Hiding Properties  This section works through an example of hiding properties. Hiding properties in an immutable  object is fairly easy; hiding properties when operations on the object can change a hidden property is  rather more complicated.  Before we start, it’s worth noting that hiding properties is rarely really necessary. Most languages with  declaratively private properties have a back door  via reflection  that authors can use if they really  want to get at the private information.  Although interestingly, JavaScript’s own private fields, which  you’ll learn about in Chapter 18, don’t.  So for most use cases, a simple naming convention or a bit of  documentation saying “don’t access this property” is usually good enough. For situations where that  isn’t good enough, you have four options  at least :  ➤➤ Create your methods as closures in the constructor rather than putting them on the proto- type, and store the “properties” in variables parameters within the constructor call’s scope. ➤➤ Use a WeakMap as shown in Chapter 12, so the properties you want to hide aren’t on the   object at all.  ➤➤ Use private fields  which you’ll learn about in Chapter 18  when they land in implementa-  tions  as of this writing, they’re at Stage 3  or via transpilation.  ➤➤ Use a proxy to hide the properties.  The fourth option, using a proxy, is useful if you can’t—for whatever reason—use any of the other  three, perhaps because you can’t modify the implementation of the object you’re proxying.  Let’s see it in action. Assume you have a simple counter class like this:  class Counter {     constructor name  {         this._value = 0;         this.name = name;     }     increment   {         return ++this._value;     }     get value   {         return this._value;     } }  Code using this can directly observe and modify _value:  const c = new Counter "c" ; console.log "c.value before increment:" ; console.log c.value ;                        0 console.log "c._value before increment:" ; console.log c._value ;                       0 c.increment  ; console.log "c.value after increment:" ; console.log c.value ;                        1 console.log "c._value after increment:" ; console.log c._value ;                       1   392  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy  console.log "'_value' in c:" ; console.log '_value' in c ;                  true console.log "Object.keys c :" ; console.log Object.keys c  ;                 ["name", "_value"] c._value = 42; console.log "c.value after changing _value:" ; console.log c.value ;                        42   You can run that from the not-hiding-properties.js file in the downloads.   Let’s assume you want to hide the _value property so it can’t be directly observed or changed by  code using an instance of the counter, and you can’t or don’t want to use one of the other mechanisms  for that. To do so, at a minimum you need to hook into several operations: ➤➤ get so you return undefined for the property instead of its value ➤➤ getOwnPropertyDescriptor so you return undefined instead of a property   descriptor for it  ➤➤ has so you don’t report the existence of the property ➤➤ ownKeys for the same reason ➤➤ defineProperty so you don’t allow setting the property  either directly or via   Object.defineProperty or Reflect.defineProperty  and so you don’t allow   changing the property’s enumerability, etc.  ➤➤ deleteProperty so the property can’t be deleted  There’s no need to use the set trap, since as you learned earlier, all operations that modify a data  property end up going through the defineProperty trap.  If you were hiding an accessor property,  then you’d need to use the set trap since only data property changes go through defineProperty.   Let’s start there and see how we get on:  function getCounter name  {     const p = new Proxy new Counter name , {         get target, name, receiver  {             if  name === "_value"  {                 return undefined;             }             return Reflect.get target, name, receiver ;         },         getOwnPropertyDescriptor target, propName  {             if  name === "_value"  {                 return undefined;             }             return Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor target, propName ;         },         defineProperty target, name, descriptor  {             if  name === "_value"  {                 return false;             }             return Reflect.defineProperty target, name, descriptor ;         },   Proxy  ❘  393          has target, name  {             if  name === "_value"  {                 return false;             }             return Reflect.has target, name ;         },         ownKeys target  {             return Reflect.ownKeys target .filter key => key !== "_value" ;         }     } ;     return p; }  That seems like it should do the trick, right? Let’s do the same series of operations on it that we did  before, but using const p = getCounter "p"  instead of const c = new Counter "c" :  const p = getCounter "p" ; console.log "p.value before increment:" ; console.log p.value ;                        0 console.log "p._value before increment:" ; console.log p._value ;                       undefined p.increment  ;                               Throws an error!  It starts out okay, but then the call to increment fails  try it by running hiding-properties-1.js  from the downloads , pointing to the ++this._value; line:  TypeError: 'defineProperty' on proxy: trap returned falsish for property '_value'  Why was the proxy called for that line within Counter’s code?  Let’s look at what happens when p.increment   is executed:  ➤➤ [[Get]] is called on the object to get the increment property; since that name isn’t “_value”,   our get trap handler returns the function via Reflect.get.  ➤➤ [[Call]] is called on increment with this set to . . . you see the problem, don’t you? this is  set to the proxy, not to the target. After all, the call was p.increment  , so within the call  to increment, this is p.  So how do you make increment work with the target rather than the proxy? You have a couple of  options: a function wrapper around increment, or . . . a proxy around it  this section is, after all,  about proxies—and that way, the function’s name and length and such are reflected by the wrapper .  But that’s fairly inefficient, creating a new proxy  or wrapper  for essentially every call to a function.  In Chapter 12 you learned a convenient technique for keeping a map of things without forcing the  key to stay in memory: a WeakMap. The code could use a WeakMap with the original function as the  key and its proxy as the value. You might modify the get handler to proxy functions as and when  required, remembering those proxies for reuse:  function getCounter name  {     const functionProxies = new WeakMap  ;     const p = new Proxy new Counter name , {         get target, name  {             if  name === "_value"  {                 return undefined;             }   394  ❘  CHAPTER 14    Reflection—Reflect and PRoxy              let value = Reflect.get target, name ;             if  typeof value === "function"  {                 let funcProxy = functionProxies.get value ;                 if  !funcProxy  {                     funcProxy = new Proxy value, {                         apply funcTarget, thisValue, args  {                             const t = thisValue === p ? target : thisValue;                             return Reflect.apply funcTarget, t, args ;                         }                     } ;                     functionProxies.set value, funcProxy ;                     value = funcProxy;                 }             }             return value;         },            ...no changes to the other trap handlers...     } ;     return p; }  Note how the proxy uses the original target object  the Counter instance, target  rather than the  proxy when calling increment. That does the trick: try running hiding-properties-2.js from the  downloads. You can see that increment still works, but _value is inaccessible from the outside.  It’s still possible to make this proxied counter fail, by getting increment from the counter’s prototype  instead of from the proxy  hiding-properties-fail.js in the downloads :  const { increment } = Object.getPrototypeOf p ; increment.call p ;    => Throws TypeError: 'defineProperty' on proxy: trap returned falsish...  or by wrapping a proxy around the proxy or using the proxied counter as a prototype  since in both  cases, the thisValue === p check in the apply trap wouldn’t be true anymore , but the basic use  case is handled correctly. It’s possible to allow for the case of the proxy being used as a prototype  by  looping the prototypes of thisValue to see if the proxy is one of them , but you probably can’t work  around the issue of a proxied proxy.  The takeaway here, other than “test your proxies very thoroughly,” is that proxies are powerful, but  also potentially complicated in real-world use.  Revocable Proxies  At the beginning of this chapter you learned that proxies are useful for providing a boundary between  two bits of code, such as an API and its consumers. A revocable proxy is particularly useful for that,  because you can revoke the object you provide  the proxy  when the time comes. Revoking a proxy  does two important things:  ➤➤ It makes all operations on the revoked proxy fail with an error. Gate-keeping at its finest! ➤➤ It releases the link the proxy had to its target object. The proxy releasing its link to the  target means that although the consuming code may still reference the proxy, the target  object can be garbage collected. This minimizes the memory impact of revoked proxies that  are strongly held by the consumer code. For instance, a quick test suggests that a revoked    Old Habits to New  ❘  395  proxy is only 32 bytes on Chrome’s V8 engine  that could change, of course , where the  target object is likely to be rather larger.  To create a revocable proxy, you call the Proxy.revocable method rather than using new Proxy.  The Proxy.revocable method returns an object with a proxy property  the proxy  and a revoke  method  to revoke the proxy . See Listing 14-8.  LISTING 14-8:  Revocable proxy example—revocable-proxy-example.js  const obj = {answer: 42}; const { proxy, revoke } = Proxy.revocable obj, {} ; console.log proxy.answer ;    42 revoke  ; console.log proxy.answer ;    TypeError: Cannot perform 'get' on                                a proxy that has been revoked  Note that once the proxy was revoked, attempting to use it failed.  The example in Listing 14-8 doesn’t specify any trap handlers, but that’s just to keep the example  short. It could have the same handlers with the same behaviors as the proxies you’ve seen throughout  this chapter.  OLD HABITS TO NEW  The features provided by Reflect and Proxy are fundamentally new features to JavaScript and  generally solve new problems rather than providing new solutions to old problems. But there are still  a couple of practices you might consider changing.  Use Proxies Rather Than Relying on Consumer Code   Not to Modify API Objects  Old habit: Providing API objects directly to consuming code.  New habit: Providing proxies—perhaps revocable ones—instead. This lets you control the access the  consuming code has to the object, including  if you provide a revocable proxy  cancelling all access to  the object when appropriate in your code.  Use Proxies to Separate Implementation Code  from Instrumenting Code  Old habit: Intermixing instrumentation code  code designed to help determine patterns of object  usage, performance, etc.  with implementation code  code that ensures the object does its job  correctly .

In this chapter, you’ll learn about the many new regular expression features added in ES015  and ES2018, including a flags property on instances reflecting all of the flags for the instance;  named capture groups for more readable, maintainable regular expressions; lookbehind asser‑ tions; and Unicode property escapes providing access to powerful matching classes.   398  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  THE FLAGS PROPERTY  In ES2015, regular expressions got a flags accessor property that returns a string containing the  flags for the expression. Prior to the flags property, the only way to know what flags the RegExp  object had was to look at the individual properties reflecting its individual flags  rex.global,   rex.multiline, etc. , or use its toString method and look at the end of the string. The flags   property makes them available directly as a string:  const rex =  example ig; console.log rex.flags ;    "gi"  The specification defines that the flags are provided in alphabetical order, regardless of how they were  specified when the expression was created: gimsuy.  You’ll learn about those three new ones, s, u,  and y, in the following sections.  You can see the order being applied in the example, which created  the expression with the flags ig but then output gi when displaying the flags property’s value.  NEW FLAGS  In ES2015 and ES2018, TC39 added new regular expression mode flags:  ➤➤ y: The “sticky” flag  ES2015  means that a regular expression only matches starting at the  regular expression object’s lastIndex index in the string  it doesn’t search for a match later  in the string .  ➤➤ u: The “Unicode” flag  ES2015  enables various Unicode features that are disabled   by default.  ➤➤ s: The “dot all” flag  ES2018  makes the “any character” token  .  match line terminators.  Let’s look at each of those in more detail.  The Sticky Flag  y   The y flag means that when evaluating the regular expression against a string, the JavaScript engine  doesn’t search through the string, it only checks for a match in the string starting at the regular  expression object’s lastIndex index. See Listing 15‑1.  LISTING 15-1:  Sticky flag example—sticky-example.js  function tryRex rex, str  {     console.log `lastIndex: ${rex.lastIndex}` ;     const match = rex.exec str ;     if  match  {         console.log `Match:     ${match[0]}` ;         console.log `At:        ${match.index}` ;     } else {         console.log "No match" ;     } }     New Flags  ❘  399  const str = "this is a test";      Non-sticky, searches string: tryRex  test , str ;    lastIndex: 0    Match:     test    At:        10      Sticky, doesn't search, matches only at `lastIndex`: const rex1 =  test y;     `rex.lastIndex` defaults to 0  tryRex rex1, str ;    lastIndex: 0    No match   const rex2 =  test y; rex2.lastIndex = 10;      Sets where in the string we want to match tryRex rex2, str ;    lastIndex: 10    Match:     test    At:        10  Running the code in Listing 15‑1, you can see that a regular expression with no sticky flag   test    searches through the string to find a match: lastIndex is 0, but the regular expression finds the  word “test” at index 10. With the sticky flag set   test y , it doesn’t find “test” when lastIndex is  0 because “test” isn’t in the string at index 0. But it does find it when lastIndex is 10, because the  string “test” is in the string “this is a test” at index 10.  This is handy when moving through a string token by token and checking for matches against a set of  possible token patterns  regular expressions , such as when parsing. To do this before the sticky flag  was added, you had to use a ^  start‑of‑input  anchor at the beginning of the expression and chop off  characters you’d already processed from the string before doing matching, so the match would be   at the beginning of the string. The sticky flag is simpler, and makes the process more efficient by  allowing you to avoid creating those truncated strings.  You can check if the sticky flag is set by looking in flags or checking the expression’s sticky prop‑ erty, which is true if the flag is set.  The Unicode Flag  u   ES2015 improved JavaScript’s support for Unicode in many areas  see Chapter 10 for improvements  regarding strings , including in regular expressions. To avoid creating problems for existing code,  though, the new Unicode features in regular expressions are disabled by default and enabled with the  u flag. You’ll learn about the features that require the u flag in the “Unicode Features” section later in  this chapter.  You can check if the Unicode flag is set by looking in flags or checking the expression’s unicode  property, which is true if the flag is set.   400  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  The “Dot All” Flag  s   ES2018 added the s flag  “dotAll”  to JavaScript’s regular expressions. With many flavors of regular  expressions  including JavaScript’s , it often trips people up that the “any character” token  .  doesn’t  match line terminator characters like \r and \n  and the two additional Unicode ones, \u2028 and   \u2029 . “Dot all” is a common solution, modifying the behavior of . so it matches line terminators.  Before ES2018, JavaScript didn’t support it, forcing people to use workarounds like [\s\S]  any‑ thing that is or isn’t whitespace , [\w\W]  anything that is or isn’t a “word character” , or the highly  JavaScript‑specific [^]  an empty negated character class; “not nothing” equals “anything” , etc.  See Listing 15‑3 for a “dot all” example.  LISTING 15-2:  DotAll flag example—dotAll-example.js  const str = "Testing\nAlpha\nBravo\nCharlie\nJavaScript"; console.log str.match  .[A-Z] g  ;     ["aS"] console.log str.match  .[A-Z] gs  ;    ["\nA", "\nB", "\nC", "aS"]  In the example, you can see that without the s flag, only the “aS” in “JavaScript” matched, because  the letter “a” was matched by the . and the letter “S” was matched by [A-Z]. With the s flag, the line  terminators before the “A” in “Alpha,” the “B” in “Bravo,” and the “C” in “Charlie” also matched.  You can check whether the “dot all” flag is set on an expression by looking in flags or checking the  dotAll property, which is true when the flag is set.  NAMED CAPTURE GROUPS  ES2018 added named capture groups to JavaScript’s regular expressions, joining the existing anony‑ mous capture groups. A named capture group is written in this form:   ? pattern   You put the group’s name in angle brackets just after a question mark  ?  at the beginning of the  group. A named capture group works exactly like an anonymous capture group, so it’s accessible in  the match result  result[1], etc. , as a backreference later in the expression  \1, etc. , and in replace‑ ment tokens when used with replace  $1, etc. . But you can also refer to a named group using its  name, as you’ll learn in the following sections.  Basic Functionality  A named capture group appears in the usual place in the match result and also on a new groups  object on the result as a property using the group’s name.  For example, look at the result with this anonymous capture group:  const rex =  testing  \d+  g; const result = rex.exec "This is a test: testing 123 testing" ; console.log result[0] ;        testing 123 console.log result[1] ;        123 console.log result.index ;     16 console.log result.input ;     This is a test: testing 123 testing   Named Capture Groups  ❘  401  Since the match is successful, the result is an augmented array with the full matching text at index  0, the capture group at index 1, the index of the match in an index property, and the input to the  matching operation as an input property.  Let’s use a named capture group called number instead:  const rex =  testing  ? \d+  g; const result = rex.exec "This is a test: testing 123 testing" ; console.log result[0] ;        testing 123 console.log result[1] ;        123 console.log result.index ;     16 console.log result.input ;     This is a test: testing 123 testing console.log result.groups ;    {"number": "123"}  The capture group’s value still appears at index 1, but notice the new property, groups, which is an  object with properties for each named capture group  in this case, just the one: number .  The new groups object has no prototype, as though it had been created with Object.create null .  That’s so it doesn’t have any properties at all, not even the ones most objects inherit from   Object.prototype like toString and hasOwnProperty. That way, you don’t have to worry about  possible conflicts between the names of your named capture groups and properties defined by  Object.prototype.  When you ran the earlier example, depending on your environment you may  have seen something in the output pointing out that groups has a null prototype.   Having names for your capture groups is really useful. Suppose you’re parsing a date in the U.S.   mm dd yyyy format. With anonymous capture groups, you might do it as in Listing 15‑3.  LISTING 15-3:  Parsing U.S. date format with anonymous capture groups—anon-  capture-groups1.js  const usDateRex =      ^ \d{1,2} [-\ ] \d{1,2} [-\ ] \d{4} $ ; function parseDate dateStr  {     const parts = usDateRex.exec dateStr ;     if  parts  {         let year  = +parts[3];         let month = +parts[1] - 1;         let day   = +parts[2];         if  !isNaN year  && !isNaN month  && !isNaN day   {             if  year < 50  {                 year += 2000;             } else if  year < 100  {                 year += 1900;             }             return new Date year, month, day ;         }     }     return null; } function test str  {     let result = parseDate str ;     console.log result ? result.toISOString   : "invalid format" ; }   test "12 25 2019" ;    Parses; shows date test "2019 25 12" ;    Doesn't parse; shows "invalid format"   402  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  It’s already slightly less than ideal that you have to remember that the year is at index 3  parts[3] ,  the month is at index 1, and the day is at index 2. Suppose you decide to enhance the expression by  having it try yyyy-mm-dd first and then fall back to the U.S. format if it doesn’t match. It gets a bit  painful, as you can see in Listing 15‑4.  LISTING 15-4:  Adding a second date format with anonymous capture groups—anon-  capture-groups2.js  const usDateRex =      ^ \d{1,2} [-\ ] \d{1,2} [-\ ] \d{4} $ ; const yearFirstDateRex =      ^ \d{4} [-\ ] \d{1,2} [-\ ] \d{1,2} $ ; function parseDate dateStr  {     let year, month, day;     let parts = yearFirstDateRex.exec dateStr ;     if  parts  {         year  = +parts[1];         month = +parts[2] - 1;         day   = +parts[3];     } else {         parts = usDateRex.exec dateStr ;         if  parts  {             year  = +parts[3];             month = +parts[1] - 1;             day   = +parts[2];         }     }     if  parts && !isNaN year  && !isNaN month  && !isNaN day   {         if  year < 50  {             year += 2000;         } else if  year < 100  {             year += 1900;         }         return new Date year, month, day ;     }     return null; } function test str  {     let result = parseDate str ;     console.log result ? result.toISOString   : "invalid format" ; }   test "12 25 2019" ;    Parses; shows date test "2019-12-25" ;    Parses; shows date test "12 25 19" ;      Doesn't parse; shows "invalid format"  It works, but you have to pick out the values of different capture groups depending on which regular  expression matched, based on their order in the expression, with indexes into the match array. It’s  awkward and hard to read, and awkward and error‑prone to maintain.  Suppose the original version used named capture groups, as in Listing 15‑5.   Named Capture Groups  ❘  403  LISTING 15-5:  Parsing U.S. date format with named capture groups—named-capture- groups1.js  const usDateRex =      ^ ? \d{1,2} [-\ ] ? \d{1,2} [-\ ] ? \d{4} $ ; function parseDate dateStr  {     const parts = usDateRex.exec dateStr ;     if  parts  {         let year  = +parts.groups.year;         let month = +parts.groups.month - 1;         let day   = +parts.groups.day;         if  !isNaN year  && !isNaN month  && !isNaN day   {             if  year < 50  {                 year += 2000;             } else if  year < 100  {                 year += 1900;             }             return new Date year, month, day ;         }     }     return null; } function test str  {     let result = parseDate str ;     console.log result ? result.toISOString   : "invalid format" ; }   test "12 25 2019" ;    Parses; shows date test "12 25 19" ;      Doesn't parse; shows "invalid format"  It’s already better since you don’t have to remember the order of the groups, you can just refer to  them by their names  parts.groups.year and such . But adding another format is dramatically  simpler as well; see Listing 15‑6 noting the highlighted parts, which are the only changes  other than  the usage example  from Listing 15‑5.  LISTING 15-6:  Adding a second date format with named capture groups—named-capture- groups2.js  const usDateRex =      ^ ? \d{1,2} [-\ ] ? \d{1,2} [-\ ] ? \d{4} $ ; const yearFirstDateRex =      ^ ? \d{4} [-\ ] ? \d{1,2} [-\ ] ? \d{1,2} $ ; function parseDate dateStr  {     const parts = yearFirstDateRex.exec dateStr   usDateRex.exec dateStr ;     if  parts  {         let year  = +parts.groups.year;         let month = +parts.groups.month - 1;         let day   = +parts.groups.day;         if  !isNaN year  && !isNaN month  && !isNaN day   {             if  year < 50  {                 year += 2000;   404  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates              } else if  year < 100  {                 year += 1900;             }             return new Date year, month, day ;         }     }     return null; } function test str  {     let result = parseDate str ;     console.log result ? result.toISOString   : "invalid format" ; }   test "12 25 2019" ;    Parses; shows date test "2019-12-25" ;    Parses; shows date test "12 25 19" ;      Doesn't parse; shows "invalid format"  Much simpler!  Backreferences  Named groups make backreferences clearer and easier to maintain.  You may know that you can include a backreference in order to match the value of a previous cap‑ ture group later in the expression. For instance, the following expression matches text wrapped in  either double quotes or single quotes, by using a capture group   ["']   for the leading quote and a  backreference  \1  for the trailing quote:  const rex =   ["'] .+?\1 g; const str = "testing 'a one', \"and'a two\", and'a three"; console.log str.match rex  ;    ["'a one'", "\"and'a two\""]  Note how the backreference ensured that the first entry had single quotes on either side and the sec‑ ond entry had double quotes on either side.  A named capture group can make it clearer what you’re referring back to. Named backreferences are  in the form \k :  const rex =   ? ["'] .+?\k  g; const str = "testing 'a one', \"and'a two\", and'a three"; console.log str.match rex  ;    ["'a one'", "\"and'a two\""]  Now you don’t need to count capture groups to know what the backreference is referring to. The  name makes it easy.  You might be thinking: “Hey, wait a minute, that \k  text for the backreference already meant  something!” And you’re right, it did: it’s an unnecessarily‑escaped k followed by the text  .  Because such a thing may well exist in the wild  people often escape things unnecessarily, though k  would be somewhat odd to escape , the \k  format only defines a named backreference if there  are named capture groups in the expression. Otherwise, it falls back to its old meaning. Since there  can only be named capture groups in new expressions written with named capture groups in mind   the sequence  ? x  was a syntax error before they were added , it’s safe to interpret a named  backreference as a named backreference in an expression that has named capture groups.   Lookbehind Assertions  ❘  405  Finally: although it’s best to use a named backreference with a named capture group for clarity, you  can refer to a named capture group with the old anonymous form  \1, for example , because named  capture groups are just like anonymous ones plus additional name‑related features.  Replacement Tokens  When doing a replacement with a regular expression  usually via String.prototype.replace , in  addition to the familiar way of referring to capture groups via tokens like $1, $2, etc., you can also  use named tokens in the form $ . For instance, if you want to convert dates in a string from  yyyy-mm-dd format to the common European dd mm yyyy format:  const rex =  ^ ? \d{2}\d{4} [-\ ] ? \d{1,2} [-\ ] ? \d{1,2} $ ; const str = "2019-02-14".replace rex, "$  $  $ " ; console.log str ;    "14 02 2019"  As with backreferences and match results, you can also use the anonymous form  $1 and such  with a  named group if you like.  LOOKBEHIND ASSERTIONS  ES2018 adds lookbehind assertions to regular expressions, both positive lookbehinds  matching X  only if it follows Y, without matching Y  and negative lookbehinds  matching X only if it doesn’t  follow Y, without matching whatever is where Y isn’t . These balance the lookahead assertions Java‑ Script has had for years.  Unlike some other languages, JavaScript’s lookbehind assertions are not limited to fixed‑length con‑ structs; you can use the full power of JavaScript’s regular expressions in a lookbehind.  A key aspect of lookbehind assertions as implemented in JavaScript is that they are tested right‑to‑left  instead of the usual left‑to‑right processing of regular expressions. We’ll come back to this point in a  couple of the following sections.  Let’s look at lookbehind assertions in a bit more detail. You can find and run all of the examples in  this section  in order  in lookbehind.js in the downloads.  Positive Lookbehind  Positive lookbehinds have the form  ?<=Y , where Y is the thing to look for. For instance, to match  a number following the Pound Sterling sign  £, the currency used in the United Kingdom  without  matching the pound sign, you can use a positive lookbehind to assert that it must be there:  const str1 = "We sold 10 cases for £20 each, and 5 cases for £12.99 each"; const rex1 =   ?<=£ [\d.]+ g; console.log str1.match rex1  ;    ["20", "12.99"]   To keep the example simple, this just uses [\d.]+ to match the numbers, which isn’t rigorous.   Notice how 10 and 5 were not matched, because they didn’t have the pound sign.  To do the match, conceptually the engine finds a match for the non‑assertion part  [\d.]+  and then  applies the lookbehind by taking each part of the expression in the lookbehind and testing it against    406  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  the text in front of the match, part‑by‑part, moving right‑to‑left.1 In this example, there’s just one part  in the lookbehind  £ , but it could be more complicated:  const str2 = 'The codes are: 1E7  "blue fidget" , 2G9  "white flugel" ,' +              'and 17Y7  "black diamond" '; const rex2 =   ?<=\d+[a-zA-Z]\d+ \ " .+? ?="\   g; console.log str2.match rex2  ;    => ["blue fidget", "white flugel", "black diamond"]  That expression has:  ➤➤ A positive lookbehind that matches the code format  1E7, 2G9, etc.  and an opening    parenthesis‑quote combination:  ?<=\d+[a-zA-Z]\d+ \ "   ➤➤ The expression to match the description: .+? ➤➤ A positive lookahead to match a closing quote‑parenthesis combination:  ?="\    The engine finds a match for .+?, then checks that the text just before the match matches the vari‑ ous parts of the lookbehind  ?<=\d+[a-zA-Z]\d+ \ " , right‑to‑left, as in Figure 15‑1.  Again, the  engine may be able to optimize that, but it makes a good mental model for the operation.    ?<=\d+[a−zA−Z]\d+ \ "   1. Nearest three characters are a   space, opening parenthesis, and   double quote?  2. Then a span of digits?  3. Then a single character a-z   or A-Z?  4. Then another span of digits?  FIGURE 15-1   Negative Lookbehind  Negative lookbehinds have the form  ?<!Y  where Y is what should not be present. So if you wanted  to match the 10 and 5 from the previous example instead of matching figures after pound signs, your  first thought is probably to just change  ?<=£  to  ?<!£ :  const str3 = "We sold 10 cases for £20 each, and 5 cases for £12.99 each"; const rex3 =   ?<!£ [\d.]+ g; console.log str3.match rex3  ;    ["10", "0", "5", "2.99"]  Huh? Why did it match extra numbers?  If you didn’t already expect them, think for a moment why  for instance  the 0 in £20 matched.  1  It’s likely that an actual implementation does it more efficiently than that, but thinking of it this way helps understand   some things we cover later on.   Lookbehind Assertions  ❘  407  Right! Because the 0 in £20 doesn’t have a £ right in front of it  the character right in front of it is a  2 , nor does the 2.99 in £12.99  the character right in front of 2.99 is 1 . So you’ll need to add digits  and decimals to the negative lookbehind  again, this isn’t as rigorous as you’d want in production  code, in order to keep the example simple :  const str4 = "We sold 10 cases for £20 each, and 5 cases for £12.99 each"; const rex4 =   ?<![£\d.] [\d.]+ g; console.log str4.match rex4  ;    ["10", "5"]  As with positive lookbehind, negative lookbehind is also processed part‑by‑part, right‑to‑left.  Greediness Is Right-to-Left in Lookbehinds  Within a lookbehind that uses greedy quantifiers, the greediness is right‑to‑left, not left‑to‑right as it  normally is. This naturally flows from the right‑to‑left processing of lookbehinds.  You can observe this if you have one or more capture groups within your lookbehind:  Notice that the “left” \w+ only got one character, but the “right” \w+ got all the others—the greedi‑ ness was right‑to‑left. Outside of a lookbehind  including in a lookahead , greediness is left‑to‑right:  const behind =   ? \w+  ? \w+  \d$ ; const behindMatch = "ABCD1".match behind ; console.log behindMatch.groups.left ;    => "A" console.log behindMatch.groups.right ;    => "BCD"  const ahead  =  \d ?= ? \w+  ? \w+   ; const aheadMatch = "1ABCD".match ahead ; console.log aheadMatch.groups.left ;    => "ABC" console.log aheadMatch.groups.right ;    => "D"  This is part and parcel of the right‑to‑left nature of lookbehinds in JavaScript.  Capture Group Numbering and References  Despite the right‑to‑left processing behavior of lookbehinds, the numbering of capture groups within  them remains the same  the order in which they start in the regular expression, left‑to‑right . The  earlier example of greediness used named capture groups and referred to them by name. Let’s look at  that same example with anonymous capture groups, referencing them by their position:  const behindAgain =   ?<= \w+  \w+  \d$ ; const behindMatchAgain = "ABCD1".match behindAgain ; console.log behindMatchAgain[1] ;    => "A" console.log behindMatchAgain[2] ;    => "BCD"  The greediness was right‑to‑left, but the group numbers were still assigned left‑to‑right. This is to  keep the numbering simple. They’re numbered according to where they are in the expression, not the  order in which they’re processed.   408  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  Even though they’re ordered that way in the result, they’re still evaluated right‑to‑left. You can see  that with backreferences. Outside a lookbehind, you can’t usefully refer to a group if the reference is  to the left of the group:  const rex =  \1\w+ ["']  ;    Doesn't make sense  It’s not a syntax error, but the value of the reference  \1  won’t match anything because when it’s used  by the expression the capture hasn’t been evaluated yet.  For the exact same reason, in a lookbehind, the reference can’t usefully be to the right of the capture:  const referring1 =   ?<= ["'] \w+\1 X ;        Doesn't make sense console.log referring1.test "'testing'X"  ;    => false  Instead, since the processing is right‑to‑left, you put the capture on the right and refer to it  from the left:  const referring2 =   ?<=\1\w+ ["']  X ; console.log referring2.test "'testing'X"  ;    => true  That’s true whether it’s an anonymous capture group or a named one:  const referring3 =   ? \w+ ? ["']  X ; console.log referring3.test "'testing'X"  ;    => true  The term “backreference” is still used. Think of the “back” in “backreference” as referring to looking  back in the processing of the expression, rather than looking back in the expression’s definition.  UNICODE FEATURES  In Chapter 10 you learned that JavaScript’s handling of Unicode improved markedly in ES2015  and after. That improvement extends to regular expressions. To enable the new features, the regular  expression must have the u flag, in order to preserve backward compatibility for existing regular  expressions that may use the new syntax  possibly inadvertently or unnecessarily . For instance, one  of the new syntax features assigns meaning to the sequences \p and \P, which previously were unnec‑ essary escapes on the letters p and P, respectively. Simply changing the meaning would have broken  any regular expression written with unnecessary escapes on p or P. But it’s safe to give them new  meanings in an expression created with the new u flag.  Code Point Escapes  The old Unicode escape sequence, \uNNNN, defines a single UTF‑16 code unit. As you may recall  from Chapter 10, though, a code unit may be only half of a surrogate pair. For instance, to match the    Unicode Features  ❘  409  “smiling face with smiling eyes” emoji  U+1F60A  using an escape sequence  rather than just using  the emoji literally,    you need two basic Unicode escape sequences representing the two UTF‑16  code units for that emoji  0xD83D and 0xDE0A :  const rex =  \uD83D\uDE0A ; const str = "Testing:  "; console.log rex.test str  ;    true  Figuring out the UTF‑16 code units for a Unicode code point  loosely, “character”  is awkward.  As of ES2015, a regular expression using the u flag can use a code point escape sequence instead:  a curly brace  {  after the \u followed by the code point value as hex followed by a closing curly  brace  } :  const rex =  \u{1F60A} u; const str = "Testing:  "; console.log rex.test str  ;    true  Code point escapes don’t only work on their own; you can use them in character classes to match  a range of code points. The following matches all of the code points in the “Emoticons” Unicode  block:2  [\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}].  Unicode Property Escapes  The Unicode standard doesn’t just assign a numeric value to characters, it also provides a huge  amount of information about the characters themselves. For instance, the Unicode standard can  tell you  among other things  that the character “í” is Latin script, alphabetic, not numeric, and not  punctuation; it can tell you that the character “¿” is punctuation common to multiple scripts; and so  on. These various things are called Unicode properties. As of ES2018, a regular expression using the u  flag can include Unicode property escapes to match characters by their Unicode properties. Since this  is quite new, as always check support in your target environments.  There are several types of properties; the two relevant to JavaScript’s regular expressions are binary  properties that are  as the name indicates  either true or false, and enumerated properties that   have a list of possible values. For example, the expression \p{Alphabetic} uses the binary property  Alphabetic to match any character considered alphabetic by the Unicode standard:  const rex1 =  \p{Alphabetic} gu; const s1 = "Hello, I'm James."; console.log s1.match rex1  ;    => ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "I", "m", "J", "a", "m", "e", "s"]  As you can see, the escape starts with \p{ and ends with }, with the property to match inside the  curly braces.   You can find—and run—all of the examples in this section in the unicode-property-escapes.js  file in the downloads.   2 https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Emoticons_ Unicode_block    410  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  \p is for a positive Unicode property match. For a negative one  matching all non‑alphabetic charac‑ ters, for instance , you use a capital P instead of a lowercase one  this is in keeping with other escapes,  such as \d for digits and \D for non‑digits :  const rex2 =  \P{Alphabetic} gu; const s2 = "Hello, I'm James."; console.log s2.match rex2  ;    => [",", " ", "\"", " ", "."]  You can also use specified aliases  for instance, Alpha instead of Alphabetic . The boolean property  values and aliases you can use are listed in the “Binary Unicode property aliases and their canonical  property names” table3 in the spec.  There are three enumerated properties you can use:  ➤➤ General_Category  alias: gc : The most basic overall character property, a categorization   of Unicode characters into Letters, Punctuation, Symbols, Marks, Numbers, Separators,  and Other  with various subcategories . The General_Category values and aliases you   can use are listed in the “Value aliases and canonical values for the Unicode property  General_Category” table4 in the spec. You can find more information about the   General_Category property in Unicode Technical Standard 18.5  ➤➤ Script  alias: sc : Assigns a single script category to a character, such as Latin, Greek,  Cyrillic, etc.; Common for characters that are used across multiple scripts; Inherited  for characters used across multiple scripts that inherit their script from a preceding base  character; or Unknown for various code points that don’t fit into script classification.   The values and aliases you can use are listed in the spec in the “Value aliases and canonical  values for the Unicode properties Script and Script_Extensions” table.6 You can find more  information about the Script property in “The Script Property” in Unicode Technical  Standard 24.7  ➤➤ Script_Extensions  alias: scx : Assigns a set of script categories to characters  rather  than just Common  to more precisely specify the scripts in which a character occurs. The  valid value names and aliases are the same as for Script. You can find more information  about the Script property in “The Script_Extensions Property” in Unicode Technical  Standard 24.8  For instance, to find all of the characters in Greek script in a string:  const rex3 =  \p{Script_Extensions=Greek} gu; const s3 = "The greek letters alpha  α , beta  β , and gamma  γ  are used..."; console.log s3.match rex3  ;    => ["α", "β", "γ"]  3 https:  tc39.es ecma262 table-binary-unicode-properties  4 https:  tc39.es ecma262 table-unicode-general-category-values 5 https:  unicode.org reports tr18 General_Category_Property 6 https:  tc39.es ecma262 table-unicode-script-values 7 https:  unicode.org reports tr24 Script 8 https:  unicode.org reports tr24 Script_Extensions   Unicode Features  ❘  411   You could use the alias scx instead:  \p{scx=Greek} gu.   The most useful enumerated property is General_Category, so there’s a shorthand   form you can use: you can leave off the General_Category= part. For instance, both   \p{General_Category=Punctuation} and \p{Punctuation} find the punctuation in a string:  const rex4a =  \p{General_Category=Punctuation} gu; const rex4b =  \p{Punctuation} gu; const s4 = "Hello, my name is Pranay. It means \"romance\" in Hindi."; console.log s4.match rex4a  ;    => [",", "'", ".", "\"", "\"", "."] console.log s4.match rex4b  ;    => [",", "'", ".", "\"", "\"", "."]  You may be thinking “But isn’t that how you specify a binary property like Alphabetic?” Yes, it is.  Since there’s no overlap between the valid General_Category values aliases and the binary property  names aliases, it’s not ambiguous to the regular expression parser, even though it may be a bit unclear  to future readers of the code, if they don’t happen to know the alias. Whether you use the shorthand  form for General_Category properties is a matter of style.  Property names and values are case‑sensitive; Script is a valid property name, script is not.  If you’re used to similar features in other regular expression  regex  flavors, note that JavaScript’s  Unicode property escapes are quite strict and narrowly targeted  for the moment, anyway . The   spec doesn’t support various shorthand or alternative forms, or additional Unicode properties  and it  doesn’t allow engines to support them as an add‑on . For instance:  ➤➤ Leaving off the curly braces. In some regex flavors, \p{L}  using the alias for the Lower   value in General_Category  can be written \pL. That is not supported in JavaScript.  ➤➤ Using : instead of = when specifying the name and value. Some regex flavors allow   \p{scx:Greek} in addition to \p{scx=Greek}. In JavaScript, it must be an equals sign  = .  ➤➤ Allowing “is” in various places. Some regex flavors allow adding “is” on property names or   values, for instance \p{Script=IsGreek}. This is not allowed in JavaScript.  ➤➤ Properties other than the binary properties, General_Category, Script, and    Script _ Extensions. Some regex flavors support other properties, such as Name.   For now at least, JavaScript does not.  Adding the new property escapes feature with a small, clearly defined scope and strict rules makes it  easier for engine implementers to add it and for people to use it. Additional features can always be  added by subsequent proposals, if they gain enough support to progress through the process.  The examples so far have been a bit contrived; in terms of real‑world usage, one of the examples from  the Unicode escapes proposal9 is useful: a Unicode‑aware version of \w. Famously, \w is quite English‑ centric, being defined as [A-Za-z0-9_]. And it doesn’t even match all characters found in many  words commonly used in English having been borrowed from other languages  such as “résumé” or   9 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes   412  ❘  CHAPTER 15    RegulaR expRession updates  “naïve” , much less words written in other languages. The Unicode‑aware version, as described in  Unicode Technical Standard 18,10 is:  [\p{Alphabetic}\p{Mark}\p{Decimal_Number}\p{Connector_Punctuation}\p{Join_Control}]  or using shorthand aliases:  [\p{Alpha}\p{M}\p{digit}\p{Pc}\p{Join_C}]  See Listing 15‑7 for the proposal’s full Unicode‑aware \w example.

In this chapter, you’ll learn about JavaScript’s shared memory feature  in ES2017+ , allow- ing memory to be shared between threads, and the Atomics object you can use to perform  low-level shared memory operations and to suspend and resume threads based on events in  shared memory.  INTRODUCTION  For most of the decade or so that JavaScript on browsers hasn’t been single-threaded  thanks  to web workers , there was no way to share memory across threads in the browser. Initially,  threads could post messages to each other with data in them, but the data was copied. When  it’s a lot of data, or it has to be sent back and forth a lot, that’s a problem. A few years later  when typed arrays  Chapter 11  were defined, originally outside JavaScript and then added to  ES2015, in many cases it became possible to transfer data from one thread to another without  copying it, but the sending thread had to give up access to the data being sent.  ES2017 changed that with SharedArrayBuffer. With a SharedArrayBuffer, JavaScript code  running in one thread can share memory with JavaScript code running on another thread.  Before getting into how shared memory works in JavaScript, let’s explore the question of  whether you really need to use it at all.   418  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  HERE THERE BE DRAGONS!  Or: Do You Really Need Shared Memory?  Sharing memory across threads opens up a host of data synchronization issues that programmers  working in typical JavaScript environments haven’t had to deal with before. We could spend an entire  book on the subtleties of shared memory—data races, reordered stores, hoisted reads, CPU thread  caches, etc. In this chapter, we only have room to address the very basics of those issues, but in order  to use shared memory in the real world, you need to thoroughly understand them or at least know  and closely adhere to best practices and patterns for avoiding them. Otherwise, you’ll spend hours or  days tracking down subtle, often difficult-to-replicate bugs—or worse, you won’t, and then you’ll get  nearly-impossible-to-replicate bug reports from the field. Developing that knowledge and or master- ing those best practices is a significant time investment. Dipping into shared memory is not something  to do lightly.  For most use cases, you don’t need shared memory, in part thanks to transferables: objects you can  transfer between threads rather than copying between threads. Various objects are transferable   including some image types and canvases on browsers , including ArrayBuffers. So if you have  data you need to pass back and forth between two threads, you can avoid the overhead of copying  it by transferring it. For instance, the following code creates a Uint8Array and passes it to a worker  thread, transferring its underlying data via its buffer rather than copying it:  const MB = 1024 * 1024; let array = new Uint8Array 20 * MB ;    ...fill in 20MB of data... worker.postMessage {array}, [array.buffer] ;  The first argument is the data to send  the array ; the second argument is an array of transferables  to transfer rather than copying. The worker thread receives a clone of the array object, but its data is  transferred: the clone reuses the original array’s data because the array’s ArrayBuffer is listed in the  list of transferables. It’s like handing off a baton in a relay race: the sending thread passes the buffer   the baton  to the worker thread, which takes it and runs with it. After the postMessage call, the  sending thread’s array no longer has access to the buffer: array in that example effectively becomes a  zero-length array.  When the worker receives the array, it can use and operate on the data without worrying about   other threads working on it, then if appropriate it can transfer it back to the original thread  or   some other thread .  Transferring the data back and forth in this way is quite efficient and avoids entire classes of issues  that can arise when literally sharing the underlying buffer between the threads. Before using shared  memory, it’s well worth asking yourself whether transferring would be sufficient. You may save your- self a lot of time and trouble.  BROWSER SUPPORT  One last thing before we get into the details of shared memory: in January 2018 browsers disabled  shared memory in response to the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities in CPUs. Chrome added    Browser Support  ❘  419  support back for some use cases in July of that year on platforms where its site isolation feature was  active, but a more general approach emerged toward the end of 2019 through the hard work of a  large list of people, showing up in browsers from early 2020. Now it’s possible to share memory  again, but only between secure contexts.1  If you’re not bothered about the “why” and are only interested in the “how,” the short version is that  to share memory, you need to do two things: A  serve your documents and scripts securely or locally   that is, via https or similar, or localhost or similar  and B  include these two HTTP headers  with them:  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp   The first header isn’t needed on content intended for frames, or on scripts, but it’s fine if it’s  there anyway.   If you’re not interested in the details, you can skip to the next section now.   Brief pause . . .   Still with me? Good!  Briefly, a context is a web specification concept for the container of a window tab frame or worker   such as a web dedicated worker or a service worker . The context containing a window is reused as  navigation is performed in the window, even when moving from one origin to another. The DOM  and JavaScript realm are discarded and new ones created during navigation, but still within the same  context—at least traditionally.  Browsers group related contexts together into context groups. For instance, if a window contains an  iframe, the contexts for the window and iframe are traditionally in the same context group, because  they can interact with each other  via window.parent, window.frames, and such . Similarly, contexts  for a window and a popup it opens are traditionally in the same context group, again because they  can interact. If the contexts are from different origins, their interaction is limited by default, but there  is still some possible interaction.  Why do contexts and context groups matter? Because typically, all of the contexts in a context group  use memory within the same operating system process. Modern browsers are multi-process applica- tions, usually with at least one overall coordinating process and then a separate process for each con- text group. This architecture makes the browser more robust: a crash in one context group doesn’t  affect any of the others or the coordinating process, because they’re in entirely different operating  system processes. But everything in the same context group is typically in the same process.  Which is where Spectre and Meltdown come into the story.  Spectre and Meltdown are hardware vulnerabilities. They exploit branch-prediction in modern CPUs  in such a way that code can access all memory in the current process, bypassing any in-process access  checks. They aren’t limited to browsers, but in browsers shared memory and high-precision timers  made it possible to exploit those vulnerabilities from JavaScript code. That means that malicious code   1 https:  w3c.github.io webappsec-secure-contexts    420  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  can read any memory in the process, even the memory for another window or web worker. It can  bypass any in-process access checks the browser may have in place, such as between contexts from  different origins.  The solution is to ensure that the content of resources  scripts, documents  hasn’t been tampered with   by requiring them to be delivered securely or locally  and to allow resources to restrict what context  groups they can be loaded into  via the headers .  Let’s look at those headers.  The first header, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy,2 lets a top-level window ensure that it is only in a  context group with other top-level windows from the same origin that have the same header value  it does  typically same-origin . When top-level navigation occurs, if the new content’s origin and  header don’t match up with the previous one’s, the browser creates a new context in a new context  group to hold the new resource’s content.  The second header, Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy,3 lets a resource specify that it can only be  loaded by a same origin window or a window that the resource expressly authorizes via a Cross-  Origin Resource Policy4  CORP  header or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing5  CORS . That ensures  that the resource can’t be embedded in a container it doesn’t trust.  Taken together, those protect against using shared memory and high-precision timers to use Spectre  or Meltdown to access data that the code shouldn’t have access to. If you want to learn about it in  more detail, I recommend “COOP and COEP explained”6 by Artur Janc, Charlie Reis, and Anne  van Kesteren.  SHARED MEMORY BASICS  In this section, you’ll learn some of the basics of shared memory, such as what critical sections are;  how to create, share, and use shared memory; and how to use locking to protect critical sections of  code with locks and condition variables.  Critical Sections, Locks, and Condition Variables  A critical section is code running on a thread that needs to access  read and or write  shared memory  in a way that is atomic relative to any actions being performed by concurrent threads that share the  memory. For example, in a critical section, reading the same memory twice must always result in the  same value:  const v1 = shared[0]; const v2 = shared[0];    In a critical section, `v1` and `v2` MUST contain the same value here  2 https:  docs.google.com document d 1Ey3MXcLzwR1T7aarkpBXEwP7jKdd2NvQdgYvF8_8scI edit 3 https:  wicg.github.io cross-origin-embedder-policy  4 https:  fetch.spec.whatwg.org cross-origin-resource-policy-header  5 https:  fetch.spec.whatwg.org http-cors-protocol 6 https:  docs.google.com document d 1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k edit   Shared Memory Basics  ❘  421  Similarly, in a critical section, if code reads from shared memory, updates the value, and writes back  to shared memory, it must not be possible that it’s overwriting a different value that has been written  there by another thread in the meantime:  const v = shared[0] + 1; shared[0] = v;    MUST NOT overwrite a value written by another thread after                   the read above  in a critical section   A lock is a means of protecting critical sections by providing exclusive access to the shared memory  to a thread using the lock: the lock can only be acquired by a single thread at a time, and only that  thread is allowed to access the shared memory.  A lock is sometimes called a mutex, which is sort for  “mutual-exclusion.”   A condition variable provides a way for threads using a given lock to wait for a condition to become  true, and to notify each other when it becomes true. Threads can wait on the condition and can notify  waiting threads that the condition has become true. When a thread is notified that the condition is  true, it can try to acquire the lock that condition variable relates to so it can do the work it needs to  do now that the condition is true  or at least, now that it was true just a moment ago—as with time  travel, verb tenses can be a bit tricky in concurrent programming .  In a simple situation, you need only one condition variable for a lock and the two things are some- times combined: the condition is “the lock is available.” That would be sufficient if, for example, you  had multiple threads that all needed to do the same kind of work on a shared buffer.  But situations are often more complex than that, requiring more than one condition variable for the  same lock and shared memory. One classic use of shared memory is distributing work to threads via  a queue: a producer thread puts pieces of work in the queue, and consumer threads take work from  the queue and do it. The queue is the shared memory. Putting work in the queue is a critical section  of code: to do that without possibly breaking the queue, a thread needs temporary exclusive access  to the queue. You can’t have two threads changing the internal state of the queue at the same time,  because they’ll stomp on each other’s changes. Taking work out of the queue is another critical sec- tion, for the same reason. The threads use a lock to protect those critical sections so the queue isn’t  modified by more than one thread at a time. So far so good.  If there’s no work in the queue, the consumer threads have to wait until work gets added to it. Since  the queue is of limited size  let’s say it can hold 100 entries , if it’s full the producer thread has to wait  until it’s not full anymore to add a piece of work to it. Those are two different conditions associated  with the same lock: the condition “queue has work” that the consumers wait for, and the condition  “queue has room” that the producer waits for.  Although it would be possible to implement this producer consumer queue with just one condition   “the lock is available” , it would be inefficient, for a couple of reasons:  ➤➤ If there were only one condition, both the producer thread and the consumer threads   would need to wait on that one condition for their different reasons, even though when that  condition becomes true it may or may not mean that they can do their work. For instance,  if four workers are waiting for work and one piece of work is added, they all get notified  and race to get the lock, and then the one that got the lock picks up the work while the  other three go back to waiting. Once that consumer has taken the work from the queue, it    422  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  releases the lock, notifying all of the other consumers, which makes them race to get the  lock, even though no new work has been added to the queue—that second notification was  for the producer thread, to let it know that there’s room in the queue again, not for the  consumer threads.  ➤➤ If there were only one condition, all threads using the lock would have to be notified that  the condition had become true  the producer and all consumers . In contrast, if there are  two separate conditions  “queue has work” and “queue has room” , only one thread needs  to be notified when each of those conditions becomes true. There’s no need to wake up all of  the consumer threads when “queue has work” becomes true, they’d all race for a lock when  only one of them can win that race. And there’s no point at all in waking up any consumer  thread for the “queue has room” condition; only the producer thread cares about that one.  That’s why locks and condition variables are separate concepts, but closely related ones. Later in this  chapter, you’ll see an example of exactly this kind of producer consumer situation.  Creating Shared Memory  To create an array with shared memory, you first create the SharedArrayBuffer and then use it  when creating the array. Since you specify the size of a SharedArrayBuffer in bytes, not entries, you  often multiply the number of entries you want by the array constructor’s BYTES_PER_ELEMENT prop- erty.7 For instance, to create a shared Uint16Array with 5 entries:  const sharedBuf = new SharedArrayBuffer 5 * Uint16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT ; const sharedArray = new Uint16Array sharedBuf ;  To share that array with a web worker in a browser, you can include it in a message via   post Message. For instance, assuming worker refers to a web worker, you can share the preceding   sharedArray like this:  worker.postMessage sharedArray ;  The worker receives the shared array as the data property of the event object for the message event.  Often, rather than just sending the array, it’s useful to send an object with some kind of indication of  what the message is about, making the array a property of that object:  worker.postMessage {type: "init", sharedArray} ;  That sends an object with the properties type  "init"  and sharedArray  the shared array ; the  worker will receive that object as the data property on the event.  More on what’s actually shared  in a bit.   Let’s put those together into a basic example. Listing 16-1 shows the main thread code sharing a   Uint16Array with a web worker thread.  LISTING 16-1:  Basic SharedArrayBuffer usage  main thread —basic-SharedArrayBuffer-main.js  const sharedBuf = new SharedArrayBuffer 5 * Uint16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT ; const sharedArray = new Uint16Array sharedBuf ;  7  Entries are often called elements, which explains why the property has the name BYTES_PER_ELEMENT. I use entries  in this book to avoid confusion with DOM elements.   Shared Memory Basics  ❘  423  const worker = new Worker ". basic-SharedArrayBuffer-worker.js" ; let counter = 0; console.log "initial: " + formatArray sharedArray  ; worker.addEventListener "message", e => {     if  e.data && e.data.type === "ping"  {         console.log "updated: " + formatArray sharedArray  ;         if  ++counter < 10  {             worker.postMessage {type: "pong"} ;         } else {             console.log "done" ;         }     } } ; worker.postMessage {type: "init", sharedArray} ;   function formatArray array  {     return Array.from          array,         b => b.toString 16 .toUpperCase  .padStart 4, "0"       .join " " ; }  Listing 16-2 shows the worker thread’s code.  LISTING 16-2:  Basic SharedArrayBuffer usage  worker —basic-SharedArrayBuffer-worker.js  let shared; let index; const updateAndPing =    => {     ++shared[index];     index =  index + 1  % shared.length;     this.postMessage {type: "ping"} ; }; this.addEventListener "message", e => {     if  e.data  {         switch  e.data.type  {             case "init":                 shared = e.data.sharedArray;                 index = 0;                 updateAndPing  ;                 break;             case "pong":                 updateAndPing  ;                 break;         }     } } ;  When the worker receives an “init” message, it remembers the shared array with its shared variable.  At that point, the main thread and the worker are sharing the memory for that array; see Figure 16-1.   424  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  main thread  worker thread  shared memory  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  FIGURE 16-1   The worker then sets its index to 0 and calls its updateAndPing function. updateAndPing incre- ments the entry at the index position in the array, increments index  wrapping around back to 0 at  the end , and then sends a “ping” message to the main thread. Because the entry the worker updates is  in shared memory, both the worker and the main thread see the update; see Figure 16-2.  main thread  formatArray      sharedArray  ;  worker thread  shared memory  0001 0000 0000 0000 0000  ++shared[index];  FIGURE 16-2   The main thread responds to the “ping” message by incrementing its counter and sending a “pong”  message; the worker responds to a “pong” by calling updateAndPing again; and so on until the main  thread’s counter reaches 10 and it stops sending “pings.” Each message to the worker makes it incre- ment the next entry in the shared array, wrapping around when it reaches the end.

If you’ve used shared memory and multiple threads in other environments, you might be wondering:  how do we know that the updates are ready to be read by the main thread? What if the updates are in  a thread-specific cache  in the JavaScript virtual machine, or even a per-thread CPU cache ?  The answer for this specific example is that postMessage is defined as a synchronization edge  that  is, a boundary across which synchronization occurs . Since the worker thread notifies the main thread  that it’s done its work using postMessage, and the main thread only tries to read the result when it  receives that message, it’s guaranteed that the write is complete before the read occurs and any per- thread caches have had any stale contents invalidated  so that attempts to read them won’t read old  values; the fresh value will be retrieved instead . So the main thread can safely read the array know- ing that any updates to it when the message was posted will be visible. This example also relies on the  fact that the worker won’t modify the array again until the main thread sends it a “ping,” so the main  thread doesn’t have to worry about reading an in-progress write  more on that in a moment .  postMessage isn’t the only synchronization edge; later in this chapter you’ll learn about more syn- chronization edges  Atomics.wait and Atomics.notify .  In that example, the array used the entire SharedArrayBuffer, but it could have just used part of  it, with perhaps another array using another part of the buffer for a different purpose. For instance,  here’s an example of a Uint8Array using the first half of a SharedArrayBuffer and a Uint32Array  using the last half:  const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer 24 ; const uint8array  = new Uint8Array sab, 0, 12 ; const uint32array = new Uint32Array sab, 12, 3 ;  The buffer is 24 bytes long. The Uint8Array takes up the first 12 bytes for 12 one-byte-long entries,  and the Uint32Array takes up the second 12 bytes for 3 four-byte-long entries.   426  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  Suppose we only needed 10 entries for the Uint8Array, though, rather than 12. You might think we  could make the buffer two bytes smaller and just move the Uint32Array so that it starts with index  10 in the buffer. But that won’t work:  const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer 22 ; const uint8array  = new Uint8Array sab, 0, 10 ; const uint32array = new Uint32Array sab, 10, 3 ;    => RangeError: start offset of Uint32Array should be a multiple of 4  Value  The issue is memory alignment. Modern computer CPUs can read and  write memory in blocks of more than a single byte. Doing so is much  more efficient when the block is aligned in memory; that is, when the  block’s location in memory is evenly divisible by the size of the block. See  Figure 16-3, which shows a series of bytes. When reading a 16-bit value,  for example, it’s much more efficient to read it from location 0x0000 or  0x0002 than it is to read it from 0x0001, because of the way the CPU  instructions are optimized. For this reason, SharedArrayBuffer instances  always refer to blocks aligned at the CPU’s largest granularity  that’s han- dled by the JavaScript engine , and you can only create a multibyte typed array using an offset into  the buffer that is aligned for the type of the array. So you can create a Uint8Array at any offset in  a buffer, but a Uint16Array needs to be at offset 0, 2, 4, etc. Similarly, a Uint32Array must be at  offset 0, 4, 8, etc.  Address 0x0000 0x0001 0x0002 0x0003 ...  0x08 0x10 0x27 0x16  FIGURE 16-3   MEMORY IS SHARED, NOT OBJECTS  When using shared memory, it’s just the memory that’s shared. The wrapper objects  the   Shared ArrayBuffer and any typed arrays using it  are not shared. For instance, in the earlier  example that passed a Uint16Array using a SharedArrayBuffer from a main thread to a worker,  the Uint16Array and SharedArrayBuffer objects weren’t shared; instead, new Uint16Array  and SharedArrayBuffer objects were created at the receiving end and attached to the underlying  memory block of the sending thread’s SharedArrayBuffer. See Figure 16-4.  main thread  worker thread  shared memory  main's Uint16Array buffer buffer  main's SharedArrayBuffer [[ArrayBufferData]] [[ArrayBufferData]]  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  worker's SharedArrayBuffer [[ArrayBufferData]] [[ArrayBufferData]]  worker's Uint16Array buffer buffer  actual memory  storage  FIGURE 16-4    Race Conditions, Out-of-Order Stores, Stale Values, Tearing, and More  ❘  427  If you like, you can easily prove this to yourself by adding custom properties to the buffer and array  objects, and then noting that you don’t see those custom properties in the worker.

RACE CONDITIONS, OUT-OF-ORDER STORES, STALE VALUES,  TEARING, AND MORE  Again: Here There Be Dragons. We’ll very lightly cover some of the dragons, but remember that entire  books are written about correctly handling shared memory across threads.   428  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  Let’s look at one scenario. Suppose you have a Uint8Array using a SharedArrayBuffer for its stor- age, and you’ve set the first couple of entries to specific values:  const sharedBuf = new SharedArrayBuffer 10 ; const sharedArray = new Uint8Array sharedBuf ; sharedArray[0] = 100; sharedArray[1] = 200;  Having set it up, you’ve shared it with another thread. Now, both threads are running, and for the  sake of this example, you’ve done no synchronization or coordination between them. At some point,  the main thread writes to those two entries  first index 0, then index 1 :  sharedArray[0] = 110; sharedArray[1] = 220;  At that same time, the worker thread reads those two entries in the opposite order  first index 1,  then index 0 :  console.log `1 is ${sharedArray[1]}` ; console.log `0 is ${sharedArray[0]}` ;  It’s entirely possible that the worker thread might output:  Simple enough; the worker read the values after the main thread did its update, and the worker saw  the updated values.  It’s equally possible that it might output:  Perhaps the worker read the values just before the main thread did its update. But  this may be sur- prising  it’s also possible that the worker read them after the main thread did its update, but still saw  the old values. To maximize performance, the operating system, the CPU, and or the JavaScript engine  may keep a cached copy of a small part of memory for each thread for a brief time.  Or sometimes,  a not-so-brief time.  So unless you do something to ensure that the memory is in sync, the seemingly  unintuitive result of the worker seeing old values even after new values have been written can occur.  Here’s the really tricky one, though—the worker might also output the following:  Take a look at that last output again. How can the worker see 220  the updated value for   sharedArray[1]  but afterward see 100  the original value for sharedArray[0] ?! The main   thread writes the new value to sharedArray[0] before writing the new value to sharedArray[1],  and the worker reads sharedArray[1] before reading sharedArray[0]!  The answer is that both reads and writes can be reordered by the JavaScript compiler or the CPU  for optimization purposes. Within a thread, that sort of reordering is never apparent, but when  you share memory between threads, it can become observable if you don’t properly synchronize  between threads.  1 is 220 0 is 110  1 is 200 0 is 100  1 is 220 0 is 100   The Atomics Object  ❘  429  Depending on the architecture of the platform your code is running on, in addition to complete values  being stale or other similar issues, it’s possible for a read operation to tear: read only part of   an in-progress write. Suppose a thread is writing to an entry in a Float32Array  one entry = four  bytes . It’s possible for a thread reading that entry to read part of the old value  for instance, the   first two bytes  and part of the new value  for instance, the second two bytes . Similarly, with a   Float64Array  one entry = eight bytes , it could be that the first four bytes of the old value and the  second four bytes of the new value get read. The problem can also happen when reading multibyte  values via a DataView. It’s not a problem for any of the integer typed arrays such as Int32Array; the  specification requires those operations to be tear-free. When asked, one of the authors of the proposal,  Lars T. Hansen, said this guarantee was present on all of the relevant hardware JavaScript engines were  likely to be implemented on, so the proposal included the guarantee in the spec.  An engine imple- mented on hardware that doesn’t provide the guarantee would need to handle guaranteeing it itself.   These are just a few of the ways you can trip yourself up with seemingly logical code when shared  memory and multiple threads are involved.  The solution  if you need to write in one thread and read in another  is to ensure some form of syn- chronization between threads operating on the same shared memory. You saw one form earlier that’s  specific to the browser environment: postMessage. There’s also a way to do this that’s defined by  JavaScript itself: the Atomics object.  THE ATOMICS OBJECT  To deal with data races, stale reads, out-of-order writes, tearing, etc., JavaScript provides the Atomics  object. It offers both high-level and low-level tools for dealing with shared memory in a consistent,  sequential, synchronized way. The methods exposed by Atomics impose order on the operations, as  well as ensuring that read-modify-write operations are uninterrupted, as you’ll see later in this chap- ter. The Atomics object also provides signaling between threads that guarantees a synchronization  edge  like the one browsers provide through postMessage .  “ATOMIC”?  You may be asking, “Why is it called Atomics? This is programming, not physics . . . ?”  The Atomics object is so named because it supports atomic operations: operations that  seem, from the outside, to happen in a single step, with no opportunity for other threads  to interact with the data of the operation while it’s in progress; the operation is indivis- ible. Although in physics it’s long been known that atoms aren’t indivisible, the word  “atom” originally meant exactly that  from Greek atomos meaning “uncut, unhewn;  indivisible” , which is why it was used  by John Dalton circa 1805  to refer to what he  thought were the indivisible component parts of the natural elements like iron  and oxygen.   430  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  sharedArray[0] = 100; sharedArray[1] = 200;  and then did:  sharedArray[0] = 110; sharedArray[1] = 220;  In the previous section’s example the main thread had a sharedArray with 100 at index 0 and 200 at  index 1, like so:  You learned in that section that other threads reading those entries may read stale values or even   see the values get written out of order. To ensure that those writes were seen by other threads sharing  the array, and seen in order, the main thread could use Atomics.store to store the new values.   Atomics.store accepts the array, the index of the entry to write to, and the value to write:  Atomics.store sharedArray, 0, 110 ; Atomics.store sharedArray, 1, 220 ;  Similarly, the worker thread would use Atomics.load to retrieve the values:  console.log Atomics.load sharedArray, 1  ; console.log Atomics.load sharedArray, 0  ;  Now, if the main thread does its writes before the worker does its reads, the worker is guaranteed  to see the updated values. The worker is also guaranteed not to see the update to index 1 before  the update to index 0; using the Atomics methods ensures those operations aren’t reordered by the  JavaScript compiler or the CPU.  If the worker thread read the values in the other order, though, it  would still be possible for it to see the updated value at index 0 and the original value at index 1, if  the timing were just right and it did its reads after the main thread wrote to index 0 but before the  main thread wrote to index 1.   Atomics also offers methods for common operations. For instance, suppose you have several work- ers, all of whom are supposed to periodically increment a counter in shared memory. You might be  tempted to write:     INCORRECT const old = Atomics.load sharedArray, index ; Atomics.store sharedArray, index, old + 1 ;  The problem with that code is that there’s a gap between the load and the store. Within that gap,  another thread can read and write that entry  even when you’re using Atomics, because it happens  between the two calls using Atomics . If this same code is running in two workers, you could have a  race like the one shown in Figure 16-5  opposite .  As you can see in the figure, Worker B’s increment was overwritten by Worker A’s, leaving the counter  with the wrong value.  The answer? Atomics.add. It accepts the array, the entry index, and a value. It reads the value of the  entry at that index, adds the given value to it, and stores the result back to the entry—all as an atomic  operation—and returns the old value of the entry:  oldValue = Atomics.add sharedArray, index, 1 ;  Another thread can’t update the value at the given index after add reads the old value and before add  writes the new value. The race between Thread A and Thread B described earlier can’t occur.   The Atomics Object  ❘  431  2. Thread B:  const old = Atomics.load      sharedArray, index  ;    old = 40  3.

Atomics offers several operations that work exactly the same way add does other than the opera- tion they perform on the entry’s value: they accept a value; modify the entry’s value according to the  operation; store the result; and return the entry’s old value.

Atomics includes the building blocks for those algorithms.  The “atomic exchange” operation is one fairly classic building block of multi-threaded   processes: atomically swapping one value for another. That operation is provided by   Atomics.exchange array, index, value : it reads the value at index in array, stores   the given value to it, and returns the previous value, all as an atomic operation.  The “atomic compare and exchange” operation is another classic building block: atomically   exchanging one value for another, but only when the old value matches an expected value. That’s  provided by Atomics.compareExchange array, index, expectedValue, replacementValue :  it reads the old value from the array entry and replaces it with replacementValue only if it matches  expectedValue. It returns the old value  whether it matched or not . compareExchange is handy for  implementing locks:  if  Atomics.compareExchange locksArray, DATA_LOCK_INDEX, 0, 1  === 0  {                                                           ↑     ↑        ↑                                                                                                       Expect it to be 0 −−                                                   If it is, write 1 −                Check that the previous value was the expected value  0  −−         Got the lock, do some work on the data the lock protects     for  let i = 0; i < dataArray.length; ++i  {         dataArray[i] *= 2;     }        Release the lock     Atomics.store locksArray, DATA_LOCK_INDEX, 0 ; }  In that example, an entry in locksArray is being used as a gatekeeper to dataArray: a thread   is only allowed to access modify dataArray if it succeeds in atomically changing the entry at   DATA_LOCK_INDEX from 0 to 1. In that example, having gotten the lock, the code doubles the value of  each entry in the array; the programmer knows they can do that safely because of the lock. Having  finished updating the array, the code atomically writes 0 back to the lock index to release the lock.  Important point: that lock only works if you make sure all code that may access dataArray uses the  same lock. Using compareExchange in this way ensures that the current thread “owns” the shared  array and that the array is up to date  no pending changes held in CPU per-thread caches, etc. .  Why would you want to write your own lock like that rather than using one of the Atomics features   like using Atomics.load and such in the for loop ? There are two reasons:  ➤➤ To ensure that you handle the entire array atomically: Atomics.load and such only ensure   that their individual operation is handled atomically; other parts of the array might be  simultaneously accessed by other code, including even trying to operate on the same entry at  nearly the same time.  ➤➤ For efficiency: When you’re accessing multiple entries, it’s a lot more efficient to lock once   for the entire operation than to make Atomics do the synchronization and locking on every  individual operation.   The Atomics Object  ❘  433  Let’s imagine the earlier code used just Atomics calls to modify dataArray:  for  let i = 0; i < dataArray.length; ++i  {     let v;     do {         v = Atomics.load dataArray[i] ;     } while  v !== Atomics.compareExchange dataArray, i, v, v * 2  ; }  That’s slightly different from the earlier code: with the locksArray version, the entire dataArray is  processed as a whole; with this second version, two threads could be operating on different parts of  the array simultaneously.  Which may be useful, or not, depending on your use case—and unless you  specifically intend allowing that concurrent access, it’s likely a bug waiting to trip you up.   This second version of the code is also more complicated. Note how each iteration has to have a   do-while loop when updating its entry, since other code may change the entry value between   getting the value and trying to save the updated value.  Think back to Figure 16-5—you can’t just use  Atomics.load and the Atomics.store, because threads could race.   Finally, this second version also requires a lot of individual low-level locking unlocking operations   no fewer than two per entry in dataArray, more if the do-while loop ever has to loop because  another thread is also updating the array .  Using Atomics to Suspend and Resume Threads  As of ES2017, a thread can be suspended in the middle of a job, and then resumed to continue   processing that job. Most environments don’t allow suspending the main thread8 but do allow   suspending worker threads. The Atomics object provides the methods to do it.  To suspend a thread, you call Atomics.wait on an entry in a shared Int32Array:  result = Atomics.wait theArray, index, expectedValue, timeout ;  For example:  result = Atomics.wait sharedArray, index, 42, 30000 ;  In that example, Atomics.wait reads the value from sharedArray[index] and, if the value is  equal to 42, suspends the thread. The thread will remain suspended until something resumes it or the  timeout occurs  the timeout in the example is 30000ms; 30 seconds . If you leave off the timeout, the  default is Number.Infinity—that is, to wait forever to be resumed.  Atomics.wait returns a string saying what the result was:  ➤➤ "ok" if the thread was suspended and subsequently resumed  rather than timing out  ➤➤ "timed-out" if the thread was suspended, and resumed because the timeout was reached ➤➤ "not-equal" if the thread wasn’t suspended because the value in the array wasn’t equal to   the given value  To resume a thread waiting on that entry of the array, you call Atomics.notify:  result = Atomics.notify theArray, index, numberToResume ;  8  Not via this mechanism, anyway. Antiquated functions like alert, confirm, and prompt on browsers suspend    JavaScript on the UI thread until the modal dialog they show is dismissed, although browser makers are slowly eroding  the absolute blocking they used to provide.  For example, Chrome no longer blocks on an alert in a background tab.    434  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory  For example:  result = Atomics.notify sharedArray, index, 1 ;  The number you pass in  1 in the example  is how many waiting threads to resume; in that   example, you’re asking to resume just one thread even if multiple threads are waiting on that entry.  Atomics.notify returns the number of threads that were actually resumed  0 if there weren’t  any waiting .  While it’s suspended, a thread won’t process any further jobs from its job queue. That’s because of  JavaScript’s run-to-completion semantics; the thread can’t pick up the next job from its queue until  it finishes the one it’s doing, and it can’t do that if it’s suspended in the middle of the job. This is why  the main thread in most environments can’t be suspended; it’s usually critical that it keep processing  jobs.  The main thread in browsers is the UI thread, for instance. Suspending the UI thread would  make the UI unresponsive.   In the next section, you’ll see an example of suspending resuming threads.  SHARED MEMORY EXAMPLE  The example in this section brings together the various things you’ve learned about shared memory  and the Atomics methods throughout this chapter. It implements the producer consumer queue men- tioned earlier in “Shared Memory Basics” whose job  in this example  is to calculate the hash  MD5,  SHA-1, etc.  of a block of memory. It shares memory between the main thread, a producer thread that  fills in a block to be hashed and puts it into a queue, and several consumer threads that take blocks  from the queue and hash their contents, posting the result to the main thread.  There are actually two  queues, one for blocks waiting to be hashed and another for blocks that are available to be loaded  with new data.  It uses critical sections protected by locks; condition variables to signal when condi- tions become true; Atomics.wait to suspend threads waiting for a condition to become true; and  Atomics.notify to notify  resume  threads when the condition becomes true.  Let’s start with reusable Lock and Condition classes; see Listing 16-5.  LISTING 16-5:  Lock and Condition classes—lock-and-condition.js     Lock and Condition are inspired by Lars T. Hansen's work in this github repo:    https:  github.com lars-t-hansen js-lock-and-condition    The API of these is not the same as the ones there, but the inner workings are    very similar. But if you find a bug, assume it's mine, not Hansen's.    **  * Utility function used by `Lock` and `Condition` to check arguments to their  * constructors and certain methods that take the arguments this function takes.  *  * @param   {SharedArrayBuffer} sab         The buffer to check.  * @param   {number}            byteOffset  The offset to validate.  * @param   {number}            bytesNeeded The number of bytes needed at  *                                          that offset.  * @throws  {Error} If any of the requirements aren't met.  *  function checkArguments sab, byteOffset, bytesNeeded  {     if  ! sab instanceof SharedArrayBuffer   {         throw new Error "`sab` must be a SharedArrayBuffer" ;   Shared Memory Example  ❘  435      }        Offset must be an integer identifying a position within the buffer,        divisible by four because we use an Int32Array so we can use        `Atomics.compareExchange`.

It waited and got notified, or                2. It tried to replace `LOCKED` with `CONTENDED` and found that                `UNLOCKED` was there now.                3. It tried to wait, but the value that was there when it would                have started waiting wasn't `CONTENDED`.                Try to replace `UNLOCKED` with `CONTENDED`.             c = Atomics.compareExchange sharedState, index, UNLOCKED, CONTENDED ;         }     }        **      * Releases the lock.      *      unlock   {         const {sharedState, index} = this;            Subtract one from the current value in the state and get the old value            that was there. This converts `LOCKED` to `UNLOCKED`, or converts            `CONTENDED` to `LOCKED`  or if erroneously called when the lock is not            locked  converts `UNLOCKED` to `-1`.         const value = Atomics.sub sharedState, index, 1 ;            If the old value was `LOCKED`, we're done; it's `UNLOCKED` now.         if  value !== LOCKED  {                The old value wasn't `LOCKED`. Normally this means it was                `CONTENDED` and one or more threads may be waiting for the lock to                be released. Do so, and notify up to one thread.

You create a lock within a SharedArrayBuffer using the Lock  constructor, passing it the SharedArrayBuffer and the offset at which to create the lock:  const lock = new Lock sab, offset ;  The Lock constructor sets the initial state information for the lock in the SharedArrayBuffer and  returns the Lock instance to use. Since locks use Int32Array instances, the offset must be evenly  divisible by 4 to ensure that the array entries are aligned  you’ll get a RangeError otherwise; see the  discussion of alignment under “Creating Shared Memory” earlier in this chapter . The Lock class tells  you how many bytes of the SharedArrayBuffer it needs via a property called Lock.BYTES_NEEDED   in case you’re storing other things in the buffer, or need to make the buffer just big enough for  the lock .  Since the point of locks is to be shared across threads, to share a Lock you call its serialize method  to get a simple object you can post via postMessage:  worker.postMessage {type: "init", lock: lock.serialize  } ;  In the receiving thread, you use Lock.deserialize to get the Lock instance for that thread to use:  const lock = Lock.deserialize message.lock ;  The sending thread’s Lock instance and the receiving thread’s Lock instance will share the same  underlying data, in the SharedArrayBuffer.  To acquire the lock  to take ownership of it  in order to prevent any other thread from having it, you  call its lock method:  lock.lock  ;  lock will wait indefinitely until it can acquire the lock.  A more complicated Lock class could provide  a timeout mechanism.  Since it makes the current thread wait  via Atomics.wait , you can’t call it on  the main thread in most environments; you must use a worker thread. This example will use lock in  the producer and consumer threads in code you’ll see later.  Once the code owns the lock, it can proceed with its critical section code. When done, it releases the  lock via unlock:  lock.unlock  ;   Shared Memory Example  ❘  441  Condition works in a similar way to Lock. You create a Condition using the Condition construc- tor, passing in the Lock instance it should use and the offset within the SharedArrayBuffer where it  should keep the condition’s state information:  const myCondition = new Condition lock, conditionOffset ;  Note that you provide the Condition constructor with a Lock instance. This is because the condition  must use the same lock other conditions or code are using in relation to the same shared memory. For  instance, in the producer consumer thread example, the queue has a single lock used for fundamen- tal queue operations like putting a value in and taking a value out, and for the conditions that those  operations use such as “queue has room” and “queue has work.”  As with Lock, Condition uses an Int32Array and so the offset you provide in the constructor   call must be divisible by 4; it tells you how much room in the SharedArrayBuffer it needs via the  Condition.BYTES_NEEDED property.  To make a thread wait for a condition, you call the condition’s wait method. The thread must own  the lock the condition uses when it calls wait, which may seem surprising, but it makes sense when  you see how conditions are used. For instance, in a shared queue such as the one this example will  use, the “put” operation  putting a value into the queue  is a critical section, because it needs to access  and update the queue’s data. So the thread doing the “put” must get ownership of the lock before it  can do its work. But if the queue is full, it has to wait for the “queue has room” condition to become  true. Doing that requires releasing the lock, waiting for notification the condition is true, and then  re-acquiring the lock. Condition’s wait method handles doing that work in an appropriate way, so it  has to be called only when the thread already has the lock. Here’s a simplified example:  put value  {     this.lock.lock  ;     try {         while   *...the queue is full...*   {             this.hasRoomCondition.wait  ;         }            ...put the value in the queue...     } finally {         this.lock.unlock  ;     } }   Note that, again, this.lock must be the same lock that this.hasRoomCondition uses, the lock  protecting the queue as a whole.  Since there’s inevitably a brief moment when the condition has  become true but the waiting thread doesn’t have the lock, it can’t assume once it has the lock that the  condition is still true; another thread may have snuck in before it! That’s why the wait code in the  put snippet earlier is in a while loop, not just an if.  So how does the condition become true? In the “queue has room” condition’s case, another thread  must perform an operation that removes an item from the queue, and then notify any waiting thread  that the queue has room again. This would be in the queue’s “take” method, which would look some- thing like this:  take   {     this.lock.lock  ;     try {   442  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory             ...ensure the queue isn't empty...         const value =  * ...take the next value from the queue, making room... * ;         this.hasRoomCondition.notifyOne  ;         return value;     } finally {         this.lock.unlock  ;     } }  Condition’s notifyOne method resumes a single thread waiting for this condition, if any, using  Atomics.notify  as you’ll see in Listing 16-6 .  Those preceding snippets gloss over the second condition the queue uses, “queue has work.” That’s  also managed by the put and take methods, just in the reverse way  take waits, put notifies .

For creation and sharing it follows the same approach Lock and Condition  do, using the constructor to create the queue and sharing it via serialize and deserialize.   Since the amount of memory it takes depends on how big the queue needs to be, it provides the  LockingInt32Queue.getBytesNeeded method to tell you how many bytes it needs for the queue  capacity you request.  Since a queue may be created by a main thread  which can’t wait  and the main thread may need to  pre-populate the queue with some values, the constructor optionally accepts the initial values for the  queue. You’ll see this later when the main thread in Listing 16-7 creates a queue of available buffers.  To put work into the queue, a thread simply calls put. The queue’s code handles acquiring the lock,  waiting for room in the queue if necessary, putting the value in the queue, and notifying any thread  that may be waiting that there’s work in the queue now  via hasWorkCondition . Similarly, to take a  value from the queue, the code just calls take and the queue’s code handles the locking and waiting  necessary to take a value from the queue and to notify any possible waiting thread that the queue has  room now  via hasRoomCondition .  Listings 16-7 and 16-8 have the main entry point for this example and a very small miscellaneous  utilities module. The main entry point creates eight data buffers and two queues with capacity for the  IDs of all eight buffers: one queue for the buffers that are ready to be filled with data to be hashed   availableBuffersQueue  and another queue for the buffers that are full and ready to have their  contents hashed  pendingBuffersQueue . Then it creates a producer thread and four consumer  threads and sends them the buffers and the serialized queues along with other initialization informa- tion. It adds a message listener to the consumer queues so it can receive the hashes they calculate.  Finally, after a second it tells the producer to stop producing new values and to tell the consumers to  stop as well.  Don’t worry about the fullspeed flag for now, we’ll come back to that in a bit.   Shared Memory Example  ❘  449  LISTING 16-7:  Example main module—example-main.js     This example uses one producer worker and multiple consumer workers to calculate    hashes of data buffers. The work is managed using two queues. The queues and the    data buffers are all contained in a single `SharedArrayBuffer`. The producer    gets an available buffer ID from the `availableBuffersQueue`, fills that buffer    with random data, and then adds the buffer's ID to the `pendingBuffersQueue` to    be processed by consumers. When a consumer takes a buffer ID from the pending    queue, it calculates the hash, then puts the buffer ID back into the available    queue and posts the hash to the main thread.   import {log, setLogging} from ". example-misc.js"; import {LockingInt32Queue} from ". locking-int32-queue.js"; const fullspeed = location.search.includes "fullspeed" ; setLogging !fullspeed ;      The capacity of the queues const capacity = 8;      The size of each data buffer const dataBufferLength = 4096;      The number of buffers, must be at least as many as queue capacity const dataBufferCount = capacity;      The size of the SAB we'll need; note that since the data buffers are byte    arrays, there's no need to multiply by Uint8Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT. const bufferSize =  LockingInt32Queue.getBytesNeeded capacity  * 2  +                      dataBufferLength * dataBufferCount ;      The number of consumers we'll create const consumerCount = 4;      The number of hashes received from consumers let hashesReceived = 0;      Create the SAB, the data buffers, and the queues. Again, since the data buffers    are byte arrays this code doesn't need to use `Uint8Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`. let byteOffset = 0; const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer bufferSize ; const buffers = []; for  let n = 0; n < dataBufferCount; ++n  {     buffers[n] = new Uint8Array sab, byteOffset, dataBufferLength ;     byteOffset += dataBufferLength; } const availableBuffersQueue = new LockingInt32Queue      capacity, sab, byteOffset, [...buffers.keys  ]                                ^-- Initially, all the buffers are available  ; byteOffset += LockingInt32Queue.getBytesNeeded capacity ; const pendingBuffersQueue = new LockingInt32Queue    450  ❘  CHAPTER 16    Shared MeMory      capacity, sab, byteOffset    Initially empty  ;      Handle a message posted from a consumer. function handleConsumerMessage {data}  {     const type = data && data.type;     if  type === "hash"  {         const {consumerId, bufferId, hash} = data;         ++hashesReceived;         log              "main",             `Hash for buffer ${bufferId} from consumer${consumerId}: ${hash}, ` +             `${hashesReceived} total hashes received`          ;     } }      Create the producer and the consumers, get them started const initMessage = {     type: "init",     availableBuffersQueue: availableBuffersQueue.serialize  ,     pendingBuffersQueue: pendingBuffersQueue.serialize  ,     buffers,     fullspeed }; const producer = new Worker ". example-producer.js", {type: "module"} ; producer.postMessage {...initMessage, consumerCount} ; const consumers = []; for  let n = 0; n < consumerCount; ++n  {     const consumer = consumers[n] =         new Worker ". example-consumer.js", {type: "module"} ;     consumer.postMessage {...initMessage, consumerId: n} ;     consumer.addEventListener "message", handleConsumerMessage ; }      Tell the producer to stop producing new work after one second setTimeout    => {     producer.postMessage {type: "stop"} ;     setLogging true ;     const spinner = document.querySelector ".spinner-border" ;     spinner.classList.remove "spinning" ;     spinner.role = "presentation";     document.getElementById "message" .textContent = "Done"; }, 1000 ;    Show the main thread isn't blocked let ticks = 0;  function tick   {     const ticker = document.getElementById "ticker" ;     if  ticker  {         ticker.textContent = ++ticks;         setTimeout tick, 10 ;     } }   ;   Shared Memory Example  ❘  451  LISTING 16-8:  Example miscellaneous module—example-misc.js  let logging = true; export function log id, message  {     if  logging  {         console.log String id .padEnd 10, " " , message ;     } } export function setLogging flag  {     logging = flag; }  The producer thread is in Listing 16-9. It takes the buffers and queues from its initialization method  and starts a loop, taking an available buffer ID from the availableBuffersQueue  possibly waiting,  if the consumers are running behind , filling that buffer with random data  for this example , and  then putting its ID in the pendingBuffersQueue. Once every 500ms or so it stops the loop and   uses setTimeout to schedule it to start again almost immediately; this is so that it can receive   any message posted to it via postMessage.

AGAIN   Or: No, Seriously, Do You Really Need Shared Memory?  It bears repeating: sharing memory across threads opens up a host of data synchronization issues that  programmers working in typical JavaScript environments haven’t had to deal with before.  For most use cases, you don’t need shared memory, in part thanks to transferables. Listings 16-11  through 16-13 have an alternate implementation of the same block hashing as the earlier   example, using postMessage and transferable memory buffers rather than shared memory and   Atomics.wait Atomics.notify.

It also gets almost the same number of hashes calculated  for instance, depending on your  hardware, about 350 in total vs. about 380 for the shared memory version . Now try it by adding the  query string ?fullspeed to the URLs  for example, http:  localhost example.html?fullspeed  and http:  localhost pm-example.html?fullspeed, or https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode  live 16 example.html?fullspeed and https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode live 16 pm- example.html?fullspeed . This disables most of the logging and removes the artificial delay from  the consumer’s hash calculation. In this full-speed version, you’ll probably see a bigger difference  the  postMessage+transferables version doing roughly 10k hashes vs. the shared memory version doing  roughly 18k, again depending on your hardware . So in that case, yes, the shared memory version  is faster, though both versions could probably be optimized further. The take-away message is this:  don’t use shared memory until you know that you really need to use it, because the complexity and  opportunity for subtle bugs it adds is very real. If you do really need it, though, hopefully this chapter  has given you some basic tools to get to grips with it.  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Most of what you’ve learned in this chapter relates to new things you couldn’t do before and prob- ably won’t need to do except in very specific situations. But in those situations, there are a couple of  things you can do.  Use Shared Blocks Rather Than Exchanging Large Data   Blocks Repeatedly  Old habit: Sending large blocks of data back and forth between threads.  New habit: Share a data block between threads with appropriate synchronization coordination if you  really need to  that is, if transferables aren’t enough .  Use Atomics.wait and Atomics.notify Instead of Breaking Up  Worker Jobs to Support the Event Loop  Where Appropriate  Old habit: Artificially breaking up the work in a worker into jobs that it can complete so it can pro- cess the next message in the job queue.  New habit: Where appropriate  which it may be sometimes, and won’t be other times , consider sus- pending resuming the worker via Atomics.wait and Atomics.notify instead.

BigInt can hold any size of integer, limited only by available memory and or a reasonable   limit imposed by the JavaScript engine’s implementers.  Implementer limits are likely to be   very, very high. V8 currently allows up to one billion bits.  Do you want to hold the number   1,234,567,890,123,456,789,012,345,678  an integer with 28 significant digits  in a variable?   JavaScript’s normal number type  Number  can’t begin to think about that, not precisely anyway; but  BigInt’s got you covered.  Because BigInt is a new primitive type, typeof identifies it as "bigint".  BigInts have a literal form  digits with an n suffix, more on that in a bit  and all the usual math  operators  +, *, etc.  work with them. For example:  let a = 10000000000000000000n; let b = a   2n; console.log b ;    5000000000000000000n let c = b * 3n; console.log c ;    15000000000000000000n  The standard Math methods like Math.min don’t work with them; those methods are Number-specific.   There may well be a follow-on proposal providing some of those methods for BigInts, such as min, max,  sign, and such; others like sin and cos probably don’t make a lot of sense for an integer-only type.   Why would you use BigInt? There are two primary use cases:  ➤➤ The name kind of says it: you’re dealing with big integers, ones that may be beyond the   ability of the Number type to represent accurately  that is, ones greater than 253 .  ➤➤ You’re dealing with financial information. The floating-point imprecision of the Number type    the famous 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3 problem  makes using it a poor choice for financial tasks,  and yet, shopping carts powered by naïve JavaScript code often use them anyway. Instead,  you can use BigInt: you work in whole numbers using your currency’s smallest unit  or even  smaller in some cases . For instance, in the U.S. you might use $1 = 100n—that is, work in  cents rather than dollars.  Although for some purposes, $1 = 10000n—hundreds of cents— wouldn’t be unusual, deferring any rounding to cents until the final result of the calculation.   Having said that, there’s a Decimal type2 starting out at Stage 1 which might be suitable for  financial data. It’s not clear whether the proposal will progress, but given the precedent of  decimal types in databases and other languages like C and Java, I wouldn’t bet against it.  Let’s look at BigInt in a bit more detail.  Creating a BigInt  The simple way to create a BigInt is to use its literal notation, which is like Number’s literal notation  for integers  almost  with the letter n after it:  let i = 1234567890123456789012345678n; console.log i ;             1234567890123456789012345678n  1 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-bigint 2 https:  github.com tc39-transfer proposal-decimal   BigInt  ❘  463  Decimal, hexadecimal, and modern octal  not legacy!  are all supported:  console.log 10n ;      10n console.log 0x10n ;    16n console.log 0o10n ;    8n  Scientific notation  specifically e-notation, like 1e3 for 1000  is not supported; you can’t write 1e9n  instead of 1000000000n. This is primarily because other languages with similar notation don’t sup- port it, although those languages also don’t have the n suffix so their reasons for not supporting  it may not quite apply. Support for e-notation may be added by a follow-on proposal if use cases  justify it.  You can also create a BigInt using the BigInt function, passing it either a string or a number:  let i;    Calling BigInt with a string: i = BigInt "1234567890123456789012345678" ; console.log i ;             1234567890123456789012345678n    Calling BigInt with a number: i = BigInt 9007199254740992 ; console.log i ;             9007199254740992n  You might be wondering why I used a 28-digit number in that example when calling BigInt with a  string, but a much smaller number when calling BigInt with a number. Can you think of a reason   I would do that?  Right! The whole point of BigInt is that it can reliably hold a much larger number than the Number  type can. Although the Number type can hold numbers of the same magnitude as the massive number  in the example, it can’t do so with any precision. If you try to get that number in a Number, the value  you actually get is more than 61 billion off:     Don't do this let i = BigInt 1234567890123456789012345678 ; console.log i ;             1234567890123456850245451776n ?!??!!  The reason is that the numeric literal 1234567890123456789012345678 defines a Number; by the  time it gets passed into the BigInt function, it’s already lost precision—it’s already the number   1,234,567,890,123,456,850,245,451,776 instead of 1,234,567,890,123,456,789,012,345,678 before  the BigInt function even sees it. Which is why we have BigInt.  Explicit and Implicit Conversion  Neither BigInt nor Number is ever implicitly converted to the other; you can’t mix them as operands  to the math operators:  console.log 1n + 1 ;    => TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions  This is primarily because of the loss of precision: Number can’t handle the big integers BigInt handles,  and BigInt can’t handle the fractional values Number handles. So rather than present programmers  with a complex set of rules about what happens when you mix types in the same calculation, Java- Script simply doesn’t let you mix them. It’s also to leave the door open for adding generalized value  types to JavaScript at some point in the future.   464  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  Explicit conversion is allowed. You explicitly convert from Number to BigInt using the BigInt func- tion as you saw earlier. If the Number has a fractional portion, BigInt throws an error:  console.log BigInt 1.7  ;    => RangeError: The number 1.7 cannot be converted to a BigInt       because it is not an integer  You convert a BigInt to a Number using the Number function. If Number can’t hold the value  precisely because it’s too big, then as usual with the Number type, the nearest value it can hold  is selected, silently losing precision as the Number type often does. If you want a conversion that  doesn’t lose precision  throws or returns NaN instead , you can write a utility function for it:  function toNumber b  {     const n = Number b ;     if  BigInt n  !== b  {         const msg = typeof b === "bigint"             ? `Can't convert BigInt ${b}n to Number, loss of precision`             : `toNumber expects a BigInt`;         throw new Error msg ;             or return NaN, depending on your needs      }     return n; }  Unlike strings, BigInts can’t be converted to a Number using either unary minus or unary plus:  console.log +"20" ;    => 20 console.log +20n ;    => TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number  This might seem surprising at first, since until now +n and Number n  have always been the same   assuming Number isn’t shadowed, and other than the function call , but it turns out to be impor- tant for asm.js.3  asm.js is a strict subset of JavaScript designed to be extraordinarily optimizable.   Although you can write asm.js code by hand, its primary purpose is to be the output of compilers  that take other languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, etc. as their input. Not breaking assumptions  made by asm.js was an important design consideration for BigInt.  BigInt can be implicitly converted to string in the usual ways:  console.log "$" + 2n ;    $2  BigInts also support toString and toLocaleString.  BigInts can be implicitly converted to booleans: 0n is falsy, all other BigInts are truthy.  Finally, there’s only one kind of zero with a BigInt  not zero and “negative zero” as with Number ,  BigInts are always finite  so there’s no Infinity or -Infinity for BigInt , and they always have a  numeric value  there’s no NaN for BigInt .  Performance  3 http:  asmjs.org   Because BigInt isn’t a fixed size like a 32-bit or 64-bit integer type  instead, it can be as large as it  needs to be , BigInt performance isn’t constant like Number performance is. In general, the larger the    New Integer Literals  ❘  465  BigInt is, the longer operations on it will take, although of course that’s subject to the vagaries of the  implementation. Additionally, like most new features, BigInt performance will undoubtedly improve  over time as JavaScript engine implementers collect real-world usage information and target their  optimizations on the things that will provide real-world benefits.  BigInt64Array and BigUint64Array  A number of applications need integers that are bigger than Number can hold, but which could be  held in a 64-bit integer type. For that reason, the BigInt proposal provides two additional typed  arrays: BigInt64Array and BigUint64Array. These are arrays of 64-bit integers, whose values,  when retrieved in JavaScript code, are BigInts  just like Int32Array and Uint32Array are arrays of  32-bit integers whose values, when retrieved in JavaScript code, are Numbers .  Utility Functions  The BigInt function has two methods on it, which provide a way to get the value of a BigInt  wrapped to a given number of bits, either signed  asIntN  or unsigned  asUintN :  console.log BigInt.asIntN 16, -20000n  ;    => -20000n console.log BigInt.asUintN 16, 20000n  ;    => 20000n console.log BigInt.asIntN 16, 100000n  ;    => -31072n console.log BigInt.asUintN 16, 100000n  ;    => 34464n  The first operand is the number of bits, and the second is the BigInt to  potentially  wrap. Notice that  since 100,000 can’t fit in a 16-bit integer, the value wraps in the usual two’s complement way.  When wrapping the BigInt to a signed value, the BigInt is treated as though it were being written to a  two’s complement N-bit type. When wrapping to an unsigned value, it’s like a remainder operation with  2n, where n is the number of bits.  NEW INTEGER LITERALS  Binary Integer Literals  Moving on from BigInt ... ES2015 added two new forms of integer literals  numeric literals that don’t  have a fractional form : binary and octal.  A binary integer literal is a numeric literal written in binary  base 2; that is, with the digits 0 and 1 .  You start with 0b  a zero followed by the letter B, case-insensitive  and follow it with the binary digits  for the number:  console.log 0b100 ;    4  in decimal   As with hexadecimal literals, there is no decimal point in a binary literal. They’re integer literals  rather than numeric literals; you can only use them to write whole numbers. That said, just like hex  literals, the resulting number is JavaScript’s standard number type, which is floating point.   You can include any number of leading zeros after the b; they aren’t significant, but they can be useful for  aligning code or emphasizing the width of the field of bits you’re working with. For instance, if you were  defining flags that need to fit in eight bits  perhaps to go in a Uint8Array entry , you could do this:  But those extra zeros after the 0b are entirely optional. The following code defines exactly the same  flags, just  from a style perspective  less clearly:  466  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  const bitFlags = {     something:        0b00000001,     somethingElse:    0b00000010,     anotherThing:     0b00000100,     yetAnotherThing:  0b00001000 };  const bitFlags = {     something:        0b1,     somethingElse:    0b10,     anotherThing:     0b100,     yetAnotherThing:  0b1000 };  Octal Integer Literals, Take II  ES2015 adds a new octal integer literal form  base 8 . It uses the prefix 0o  a zero followed by the let- ter O, case-insensitive  followed by octal digits  0 through 7 :  console.log 0o10 ;    8  in decimal   Just as with hexadecimal and binary literals, these are integer literals, but they define standard  floating-point numbers.  You might be thinking “Wait, didn’t JavaScript already have an octal form?” Right you are! It used to be  that just a leading zero followed by octal digits defined a number in octal. For example, 06 defined the  number six and 011 defined the number nine. That format was problematic because it was so easily con- fused with decimal, and because if you included an 8 or 9 in the number, JavaScript engines parsed the  number as decimal, leading to the confusing situation where both 011 and 09 defined the number nine:     In loose mode only console.log 011 === 09 ;    true  How confusing! In the third-edition specification  1999 , this legacy octal form was removed as part of the  language but left in a “compatibility” section as something implementations could choose to support or not.  ES5  2009  went further and said that in strict mode, a JavaScript implementation was no longer allowed  to support legacy octal literals, and moved the “compatibility” information into the browser-only Annex B.   ES2015 further disallowed octal-like decimal literals like 09.  Disallowing the legacy format is one of the  many reasons to use strict mode: 011 and 09 are both syntax errors in strict mode, avoiding confusion.  But that’s all history. Now if you want to write octal, use the new 0o11 form; if you want to write  decimal, leave off unnecessary leading zeros4  for instance, use 9, not 09, for the number nine .  4  A leading zero followed by a decimal point, such as 0.1, is fine. It’s only when the leading zero is followed by a digit  that it’s disallowed  for instance, 03 or 01.1 .   New Math Methods  ❘  467  NEW MATH METHODS  ES2015 added a whole range of new functions to the Math object. In general, they fall into these  categories:  ➤➤ General math functions often useful in a range of applications, particularly graphics,   geometry, etc.  ➤➤ Functions to support low-level code, such as digital signal processing  DSP  and code com-  piled to JavaScript from other languages  There’s some overlap between the categories, of course, as they’re a bit arbitrary. In this section, you’ll  find most of the ones that overlap in the low-level support category.  General Math Functions  ES2015 added a host of general math functions, primarily trigonometric and logarithmic ones.  These functions are useful for graphics processing, 3D geometry, and such. Each of them returns “an  implementation-dependent approximation of” its math operation. See Table 17-1, which lists them  alphabetically, giving the operation each performs.  TABLE 17-1:  General Math Functions  FUNCTION  OPERATION  Math.acosh x   Math.asinh x   Math.atanh x   Math.cbrt x   Math.cosh x   Math.expm1 x   Math.log10 x   Math.log1p x   Math.log2 x   Math.sinh x   Math.tanh x   The inverse hyperbolic cosine of x  The inverse hyperbolic sine of x  The inverse hyperbolic tangent of x  The cube root of x  The hyperbolic cosine of x  The base 10 logarithm of x  The natural logarithm of 1 + x  The base 2 logarithm of x  The hyperbolic sine of x  The hyperbolic tangent of x  Subtracting 1 from the exponential function of x  e raised to the  power of x, where e is the base of the natural logarithms   Math.hypot v1, v1, ...   The square root of the sum of squares of its arguments   468  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  The majority of these new methods provide basic trigonometry and logarithm operations.  Math.expm1 and Math.log1p may seem odd at first, since Math.expm1 x  is logically the same as  Math.exp x  − 1 and Math.log1p x  is logically the same as Math.log x + 1 . But in both cases,  when x is close to zero, expm1 and log1p can provide a more accurate result than the equivalent code  using exp or log would because of the limits of JavaScript’s number type. An implementation can  perform the Math.expm1 x  calculation using more precision than JavaScript’s number type sup- ports, and then convert the final result to a JavaScript number  losing some precision , rather than  doing Math.exp x , converting the result to a JavaScript number  losing some precision , and then  subtracting 1 from it within the bounds of the number type’s precision. For these operations, when x  is close to zero, it helps to delay the loss of precision until after doing the − 1 or 1 + part.  Low-Level Math Support Functions  In the last few years, there’s been a lot of interest in and work on using JavaScript as a target for  cross-compiling code from other languages, such as C and C++. Usually, the tools that do this compile  to asm.js,5 a highly-optimizable subset of JavaScript.  They also usually have the ability to output  WebAssembly6 instead of, or in addition to, JavaScript.  Two projects that do this, for instance, are  Emscripten7  which is a back-end for LLVM compilers  and Cheerp8  formerly Duetto . To do what  they do while targeting asm.js, these tools and others need to do some low-level operations in ways  that are both fast and consistent with how they’re done in languages with built-in 32-bit integers and  floats. Low-level operations are often useful in compression and digital signal processing as well.  ES2015 added some functions to support these tools. By providing specific functions for them, among  other things they provided an optimization target for JavaScript engines, sometimes making it pos- sible to replace the function call with a single CPU instruction. The functions are listed alphabetically  in Table 17-2  opposite .  Like all other Math functions, if the input isn’t a number, it’s converted to a number before the opera- tion is done.  EXPONENTIATION OPERATOR  **   The exponentiation operator  **  is the operator equivalent of the Math.pow function: it raises a  number to the power of another number.  In fact, Math.pow’s definition was updated to simply say it  returns the result of using **.  Here’s an example:  console.log 2**8 ;    256  There’s a “gotcha” to be aware of: using x**y in combination with a unary operator before the base   x , for example -2**2. In math, the equivalent expression -22 means - 22 , which is -4. But in  Java Script we’re used to the unary - being very high precedence, and many of us  most?  would read  -2**2 as  -2 **2  which is 4 , despite how you’d read it in math.  5 http:  asmjs.org  6 https:  webassembly.org  7 https:  github.com kripken emscripten 8 https:  leaningtech.com cheerp    Exponentiation Operator  **   ❘  469   470  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  After extensive discussion and debate,9 TC39 made -2**2 a syntax error, so you must write  -2 **2  or - 2**2  instead to avoid the ambiguity. There were strong arguments for using the math con- vention, and there were strong arguments for keeping unary operators higher precedence than the  exponentiation operator. In the end, rather than pick a runner in that race, TC39 went with “make it  a syntax error, we can define it later if desirable.”  Different implementations use different error messages in that situation, of varying levels of  usefulness:  ➤➤ “Unexpected token **” ➤➤ “Unparenthesized unary expression can’t appear on the left-hand side of ’**’” ➤➤ “Unary operator used immediately before exponentiation expression. Parenthesis  sic  must   be used to disambiguate operator precedence”  So if you find yourself staring at an error pointing to what seems, on first glance, to be a perfectly  reasonable use of the ** operator, check to see if you have a unary minus or plus in front of it.  DATE.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING CHANGE  In ES2018, Date.prototype.toString was standardized for the first time. Up through ES2017, the  string returned was “. . . an implementation-dependent String value that represents  the date  as a  date and time in the current time zone using a convenient, human-readable form.” But all significant  JavaScript engines had ended up being consistent with one another, so TC39 decided to document the  consistency. Per specification it’s now reliably:  ➤➤ The three-letter day-of-week abbreviation in English  e.g., “Fri”  ➤➤ The three-letter month abbreviation in English  e.g., “Jan”  ➤➤ The day, zero-padded if necessary  e.g., “05”  ➤➤ The year  e.g., “2019”  ➤➤ The time in 24-hour format  e.g., “19:27:11”  ➤➤ The time zone, in the form GMT followed by + – and the offset ➤➤ Optionally, “an implementation-defined” string in parentheses giving the time zone name    such as “Pacific Standard Time”   each separated from its predecessor by a single space. For example:  console.log new Date 2018, 11, 25, 8, 30, 15 .toString   ;    => Tue Dec 25 2018 08:30:15 GMT-0800  Pacific Standard Time     or    => Tue Dec 25 2018 08:30:15 GMT-0800  9 https:  esdiscuss.org topic exponentiation-operator-precedence   Number Additions  ❘  471  FUNCTION.PROTOTYPE.TOSTRING CHANGE  Recent JavaScript specifications have standardized Function.prototype.toString, and ES2019  continues that process10 by increasing the fidelity of what’s returned by using the actual source text  that created the function when it’s available, but without requiring that the host retain the source text   which it might throw away after parsing for memory consumption reasons . Bound functions and  other functions provided by the JavaScript engine or environment return a function definition in the  following “native function” form:  function name parameters  { [native code] }  Functions defined directly by JavaScript source code return either the actual source text that defined  them  if available , or a “native function” form as shown in the preceding example. This is a change  from ES2018, which said that the JavaScript engine would provide “. . . an implementation-defined  string . . .” matching certain criteria.   There’s also a Stage 2 proposal11 that provides a way for authors to opt-in to a “censored” form,  where the source text of the function is never stored, and so toString would always return the  “native function” form.   NUMBER ADDITIONS  “Safe” Integers  ES2015 added some new properties and methods to the Number constructor.  You probably know that the JavaScript number type12 is not perfectly precise; it can’t be and still be  able to handle its huge range of values, including fractional values, while only using 64 bits. Often,  instead of the exact number, the number type holds a very close approximation of the number. For  instance, the number type can’t hold 0.1 perfectly; instead it holds a number very, very near 0.1. The  same is true of 0.2 and 0.3, leading to the famous example that 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3. We tend to  think of this imprecision only in relation to fractional numbers, but if you have a number big enough,  the imprecision occurs even in whole numbers. For example:  console.log 33333333333333333333 ;    33333333333333330000  The number that’s created by parsing the numeric literal 33333333333333333333 into a JavaScript  number is markedly lower than it would be if numbers were precise at that magnitude. But the num- ber type can’t handle that number precisely; it had to round it to the nearest number it can handle  precisely, which was several thousand lower.  To account for this, JavaScript has the concept of a safe integer. A number is a safe integer if it’s an  integer whose value is greater than –253 and less than 253.  The 53 in that comes from the fact that the   10 https:  github.com tc39 Function-prototype-toString-revision 11 https:  github.com domenic proposal-function-prototype-tostring-censorship 12 Which is an implementation of the IEEE-754 double-precision binary floating-point standard.   472  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  number type effectively has 53 bits of binary precision; the remaining bits are an exponent.  Within  that range, you can be sure that:  ➤➤ The integer is represented exactly in the number type, and ➤➤ The integer is guaranteed not to be the result of another integer having been rounded to it   thanks to floating-point imprecision.  The second rule is important. For instance, 253 is represented exactly in the number type, but the  number type can’t represent 253 + 1. If you try, the result is 253:  const a = 2**53; console.log a ;      9007199254740992  2**53  const b = a + 1; console.log b ;      9007199254740992  2**53   again   Since it might be the result of rounding, 253 isn’t “safe.” But 253 – 1 is safe, because the number type  won’t round any imprecise integer to it:  const a = 2**53 - 1; console.log a ;      9007199254740991 const b = a + 1; console.log b ;      9007199254740992 const c = a + 2; console.log c ;      9007199254740992 const d = a + 3; console.log d ;      9007199254740994  To help you avoid having to write obscure magic numbers like 2**53 and - 2**53  in your code,  the Number constructor has two properties and, probably more important a method to help. Let’s  look at them.  Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is the number 253 – 1, the maximum safe integer.   Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER is the number –253 + 1, the minimum safe integer.  Number.isSafeInteger  Number.isSafeInteger is a static method that accepts an argument and returns true if the argu- ment is of the number type, is an integer, and is in the range of safe integers; if it’s not a number, not  an integer, or outside the range, isSafeInteger returns false:  console.log Number.isSafeInteger 42  ;              true console.log Number.isSafeInteger 2**53 - 1  ;       true console.log Number.isSafeInteger - 2**53  + 1  ;    true console.log Number.isSafeInteger 2**53  ;           false  not safe  console.log Number.isSafeInteger - 2**53   ;        false  not safe  console.log Number.isSafeInteger 13.4  ;            false  not an integer  console.log Number.isSafeInteger "1"  ;             false  string, not number   When dealing with integers of such magnitude that you may be pushing the limits of safe   integers, two handy rules are that when performing the operation c = a + b or c = a - b, you     Number Additions  ❘  473  can be certain of the result in c if Number.isSafeInteger a , Number.isSafeInteger b , and  Number.isSafeInteger c  are all true; otherwise, the result may not be correct. It’s not sufficient  to only test c.  Number.isInteger  Number.isInteger is a static method that accepts an argument and returns true if  you guessed it!   the argument is a number and also an integer. It doesn’t attempt to coerce its argument to number, so  Number.isInteger "1"  is false.  Number.isFinite, Number.isNaN  Number.isFinite and Number.isNaN are just like their global counterparts isFinite and isNaN,  except that they don’t coerce their argument to number before doing their check. Instead, if you pass  them a non-number, they return false.  Number.isFinite determines if its argument is a number and, if so, whether that number is finite. It  returns false for NaN:  const s = “42”; console.log Number.isFinite s  ;           false: it's a string, not a number console.log isFinite s  ;                  true: the global function coerces console.log Number.isFinite 42  ;          true console.log Number.isFinite Infinity  ;    false console.log Number.isFinite 1   0  ;       false: in JavaScript x   0 = Infinity Number.isNaN determines if its argument is a number and, if so, whether it’s one of the NaN values:  const s = "foo"; console.log Number.isNaN s  ;      false: it's a string, not a number console.log isNaN s  ;             true: the global function coerces const n1 = 42; console.log Number.isNaN n1  ;     false console.log isNaN n1  ;            false const n2 = NaN; console.log Number.isNaN n2  ;     true console.log isNaN n2  ;            true  Number.parseInt, Number.parseFloat  These are the same functions as the global parseInt and parseFloat.  Literally the same,   Number.parseInt === parseInt is true.  They’re part of the ongoing move toward reducing   reliance on default globals.  Number.EPSILON  Number.EPSILON is a data property whose value is the difference between 1 and the smallest   value greater than 1 that can be represented as a JavaScript number value  it’s approximately   2.2204460492503130808472633361816 × 10−16 . The term comes from machine epsilon, a   measurement of floating-point rounding error in numerical analysis, which is denoted with the   Greek letter epsilon  ϵ  or a bold Roman u.   474  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  SYMBOL.ISCONCATSPREADABLE  As you may know, the concat method on arrays accepts an arbitrary number of arguments and  creates a new array with the entries from the original array plus the arguments you give it. If any of  those arguments is an array, it “flattens” the array’s entries  one level of them  into the resulting array:  const a = ["one", "two"]; const b = ["four", "five"]; console.log a.concat "three", b  ;    => ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]  Originally, concat only spread out the entries of standard arrays in this way. Famously, it didn’t do  that with the arguments pseudo-array, or other array-like objects such as the DOM’s NodeList.  As of ES2015, concat was updated so that it will spread out any argument that’s a standard array   according to Array.isArray , or that has the Symbol.isConcatSpreadable property with a  truthy value.  For instance, in the following example, obj is array-like, but it doesn’t get spread into the result by  concat; instead, the object is put in the resulting array:  const a = ["one", "two"]; const obj = {     0: "four",     1: "five",     length: 2 }; console.log a.concat "three", obj  ;    => ["one", "two", "three", {"0": "four", "1": "five", length: 2}]  But if you add Symbol.isConcatSpreadable to it with a truthy value, concat will spread its entries  out as well:  Having it might be handy on the prototype of an array-like class that doesn’t inherit from Array:  const a = ["one", "two"]; const obj = {     0: "four",     1: "five",     length: 2,     [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]: true }; console.log a.concat "three", obj  ;    => ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]  class Example {     constructor ...entries  {         this.length = 0;         this.add ...entries ;     }     add ...entries  {         for  const entry of entries  {             this[this.length++] = entry;         }     } }   Various Syntax Tweaks  ❘  475  Example.prototype[Symbol.isConcatSpreadable] = true;   const a = ["one", "two"]; const e = new Example "four", "five" ; console.log a.concat "three", e  ;    => ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]  When ES2015 was being defined, there was talk of the DOM’s NodeList and similar possibly adding  this property so they’d be concat spreadable, but it hasn’t ended up happening  as yet .  No object in the JavaScript standard library has the Symbol.isConcatSpreadable property by  default.  Not even arrays, but as described, concat checks for arrays explicitly.   VARIOUS SYNTAX TWEAKS  Nullish Coalescing  In this section, you’ll learn about some recent syntax tweaks—some of which are really useful.  When dealing with optional properties in an object, programmers often use the curiously powerful  logical OR operator    to provide a default for the possibly missing property:  const delay = this.settings.delay  300;  As you probably know, the  operator evaluates its left-hand operand and, if that value is  truthy, takes that truthy value as its result; otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and  takes that value as its result. Because of that, the example sets the delay constant to the value of  this.settings.delay if it’s a truthy value, or to 300 if this.settings.delay is a falsy value.  But there’s a problem: the programmer probably meant to use 300 only if the property wasn’t  there or had the value undefined, but that code will also use 300 if this.settings.delay is 0,  because 0 is falsy.  A new operator in ES202013 fixes that—the “nullish coalescing operator”  ?? :  const delay = this.settings.delay ?? 300;  That example sets delay to the value of this.settings.delay if that value isn’t null or   undefined, or to 300 if this.settings.delay is null or undefined. That statement using ?? is  like this one using the conditional operator     Recall that `== null`  loose equality  checks for both `null` and `undefined` const delay = this.settings.delay == null ? 300 : this.settings.delay;  except that this.settings.delay is only evaluated once in the ?? expression.  13 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-nullish-coalescing   476  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  Since the nullish coalescing operator short-circuits the same way  does, the right-hand operand isn’t  evaluated at all if the left-hand operand isn’t null or undefined. That means any side effects in the  right-hand operand aren’t performed if it’s not used. For instance:  obj.id = obj.id ?? nextId++;  In that code, nextId is only incremented if obj.id is null or undefined.  Optional Chaining  Have you ever had to write code like this?  x = some && some.deeply && some.deeply.nested && some.deeply.nested.value; y = some && some[key] && some[key].prop;  Or like this?  if  x.callback  {     x.callback  ; }  With the optional chaining operator14 in ES2020 you can write this  x = some?.deeply?.nested?.value; y = some?.[key]?.prop;  and this  x.callback?.  ;  instead. The ?. operator evaluates its left-hand operand and, if that value is null or undefined,  results in undefined and short-circuits the rest of the chain; otherwise, it does a property access and  allows the chain to continue. In the second form  x.callback?.   , if the left-hand operand is not  null or undefined, it allows the call to continue.  This is handy when a property may or may not exist on an object  or may exist with the value   undefined or null , or when you’re getting an object from an API function that may return null  and you want to get a property from that object:  const x = document.getElementById "optional" ?.value;  In that code, if the element doesn’t exist, getElementById returns null, so the optional chain- ing operator’s result is undefined, which is stored in x. But if the element exists, getElementById  returns the element and x is set to the value of the element’s value property.  Similarly, if an element may or may not exist and you want to call a method on it:  document.getElementById "optional" ?.addEventListener "click", function   {        ... } ;  14 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-optional-chaining   Various Syntax Tweaks  ❘  477  the function call isn’t made if the element doesn’t exist. Here are some further examples:  const some = {     deeply: {         nested: {             value: 42,             func   {                 return "example";             }         },         nullAtEnd: null     },     nullish1: null,     nullish2: undefined }; console.log some?.deeply?.nested?.value ;       42 console.log some?.missing?.value ;              undefined, not an error console.log some?.nullish1?.value ;                   undefined, not an error, not null console.log some?.nullish2?.value ;             undefined, not an error let k = "nested"; console.log some?.deeply?.[k]?.value ;          42 k = "nullish1"; console.log some?.deeply?.[k]?.value ;          undefined, not an error, not null k = "nullish2"; console.log some?.deeply?.[k]?.value ;          undefined, not an error k = "oops"; console.log some?.deeply?.[k]?.value ;          undefined, not an error console.log some?.deeply?.nested?.func?.   ;    "example" console.log some?.missing?.stuff?.func?.   ;    undefined, not an error console.log some?.deeply?.nullAtEnd?.   ;       undefined, not an error console.log some?.nullish1?.func?.   ;          undefined, not an error k = "nullish2"; console.log some?.[k]?.func?.   ;               undefined, not an error  Note that even when the property being tested is null, the result of the optional chaining operator is  undefined. In the previous example, you can see that on this line:  console.log some?.nullish1?.value ;                undefined, not an error, not null  Also note that using the optional chaining operator just once at the outset doesn’t make the  “optional-ness” carry over to subsequent property accessors or calls. For example:  const obj = {     foo: {         val: 42     } }; console.log obj?.bar.val ;    TypeError: Cannot read property 'val' of undefined  That would have output undefined if obj were null or undefined, because the optional chaining   operator was used to defend against obj being null or undefined via obj?.bar. But obj is an  object, so obj.bar is evaluated. Since there is no bar property on obj, that results in undefined.    478  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  Since optional chaining wasn’t used to defend against that when accessing val, the code tries to get  val from undefined and fails with an error.  To avoid that error, you’d use optional chaining when accessing val:  console.log obj?.bar?.val ;  Similarly, with that same object, this would fail:  obj?.bar  ;    TypeError: obj.bar is not a function  Since there’s no ?. after bar, nothing checks it before trying to make the call. The rule is: the ? is  immediately after the thing that may be nullish.  Optional catch Bindings  Sometimes you don’t care what error occurred, you just need to know whether something worked or  failed. In that situation, it’s common to see code like this:  Note that the code doesn’t use the error  e  for anything.  As of ES2019, you can just leave the parentheses and binding  e  off entirely:  try {     theOperation  ; } catch  e  {     doSomethingElse  ; }  try {     theOperation  ; } catch {     doSomethingElse  ; }  It’s almost universally supported in modern browsers, only Edge Legacy doesn’t support it  but  the Chromium version of Edge does . Obsolete browsers like Internet Explorer don’t support it,  of course.  Unicode Line Breaks in JSON  Okay, so this one is unlikely to have an impact on your day-to-day coding life.  Notionally, JSON is a strict subset of JavaScript, but that wasn’t actually true until a change was  made for ES2019 to allow two characters to appear unescaped in string literals that previously had  to be escaped: Unicode’s “line separator”  U+2028  and “paragraph separator”  U+2029  characters.  JSON allowed them to be unescaped in strings, but JavaScript didn’t, making for unnecessary compli- cation in the specification.  As of ES2019,15 they’re both valid in JavaScript string literals without needing to be escaped.  15 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-json-superset   Various Standard Library   Global Additions  ❘  479  Well-Formed JSON from JSON.stringify  This one probably won’t show up on your radar either, but: technically, in some edge cases,   JSON.stringify has been producing invalid JSON. You may remember from Chapter 10 that a  JavaScript string is a series of UTF-16 code units that tolerates invalid  unpaired  surrogates. If  a string value being stringified contains unpaired surrogates, the resulting JSON will contain the  unpaired surrogates as literal characters, which makes it invalid JSON.  The change  in ES2019  is simply to have unpaired surrogates output as Unicode escapes.16 So, for  instance, instead of outputting the unpaired surrogate U+DEAD as a literal character, it outputs the  Unicode escape sequence \uDEAD instead.  VARIOUS STANDARD LIBRARY   GLOBAL ADDITIONS  In this section you’ll learn about various new methods becoming available in JavaScript’s standard  library, as well as some changes to existing methods.  Symbol.hasInstance  You can use the Symbol.hasInstance well-known symbol to customize the behavior of instanceof  for a given function. Normally, x instanceof F checks to see if F.prototype is anywhere in the   prototype chain of x. But if F[Symbol.hasInstance] is a function, that function gets called instead,  and whatever it returns is converted to boolean and taken as the result of instanceof:  function FakeDate   { } Object.defineProperty FakeDate, Symbol.hasInstance, {     value value  { return value instanceof Date; } } ; console.log new Date   instanceof FakeDate ;    true  This is useful for some host-provided objects, and for codebases where prototypes and constructor  functions largely aren’t used in favor of builder functions that assign each object all of its properties  and methods directly. They can use Symbol.hasInstance to return true for objects with the appro- priate properties methods, even though they don’t have matching prototype.  Symbol.unscopables  This Symbol is to support legacy code; you’re unlikely to need to use it in your code unless you’re  writing a library that A  may be added to a site with legacy code and B  adds methods to built-in  prototypes.  Symbol.unscopables lets you specify which properties of an object should be left out when that  object is used with the with statement. Modern JavaScript code doesn’t usually use the with state- ment and it’s disallowed in strict mode, but you may know that with adds all of an object’s proper- ties to the scope chain within the with block, even non-enumerable and or inherited properties  like  toString :  16 https:  github.com gibson042 ecma262-proposal-well-formed-stringify   480  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  const obj = {     a: 1,     b: 2 }; with  obj  {     console.log a, b, typeof toString ;    1 2 "function" }  You can tell with to leave out one or more properties by listing them with a truthy value in an object  on the Symbol.unscopables property:  const obj = {     a: 1,     b: 2,     [Symbol.unscopables]: {         b: true        Makes `b` unscopable, leaving it out of `with` blocks     } }; with  obj  {     console.log a, b, typeof toString ;    ReferenceError: b is not defined }  Why would you need such a thing? Perhaps for the reason TC39 did: TC39 needed it when adding   methods to Array.prototype; the new methods conflicted with existing code using with. For instance,  suppose some legacy code had this function:  function findKeys arrayLikes  {     var keys = [];     with  Array.prototype  {         forEach.call arrayLikes, function arrayLike  {             push.apply keys, filter.call arrayLike, function value  {                 return rexIsKey.test value ;             }  ;         } ;     }     return keys; }  That code uses with to put forEach, push, and filter in scope within the block so they can easily  be used on the array-like objects being passed in. It would have broken when the keys method was  added in ES2015 because within the with block, the keys identifier would have resolved to the prop- erty instead of the keys variable the function is using.  Thanks to Symbol.unscopables, that code isn’t broken by the keys method because   Array.prototype’s Symbol.unscopables property lists all of string-named methods added   to Array.prototype in ES2015 onward, including keys; so keys is skipped in the with block.  globalThis  JavaScript is getting a new default global: globalThis.17 globalThis is the same value that this has at  global scope, which is usually a reference to the global object although the host  for instance, browser   can define any value as this at global scope, and thus as globalThis. If you’re used to writing code on   17 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-global   Various Standard Library   Global Additions  ❘  481  browsers, you probably know that browsers already have a global variable for this: window.  Actually,  they have at least three, but that’s beside the point.  But until globalThis, there was no standard global  for this outside of browsers, and it was quite awkward to access the global object in the  relatively rare   situation where you needed to in a cross-environment manner:  ➤➤ Node.js provides global  which turned out couldn’t be standardized on browsers as it   would break some existing code on the web .  ➤➤ At global scope, you can use this  which is how globalThis got its name , but a lot of code   doesn’t run at global scope  for instance, code in modules, as you learned in Chapter 13 .  globalThis makes it easy to access the same value this has at global scope, which in almost all  environments is a reference to the global object.  Symbol description Property  As you learned in Chapter 5, Symbols can have descriptions:  const s = Symbol "example" ; console.log s ;    Symbol example   Initially, you could only access that description via toString. As of ES2019, Symbols have a  description property you can get it from:18  const s = Symbol "example" ; console.log s.description ;    example  String.prototype.matchAll  Often, if you have a regular expression with a global or sticky flag, you want to process all of the  matches in a string. You can do that with the exec function of a RegExp object and a loop:  const s = "Testing 1 2 3"; const rex =  \d g; let m; while   m = rex.exec s   !== null  {     console.log `"${m[0]}" at ${m.index}, rex.lastIndex: ${rex.lastIndex}` ; }    => "1" at 8, rex.lastIndex: 9    => "2" at 10, rex.lastIndex: 11    => "3" at 12, rex.lastIndex: 13  That’s a bit verbose, though, and it involves modifications to the lastIndex property   of the RegExp object  a well-documented issue with the RegExp object . Instead, a   String.prototype.matchAll method was added to ES202019 that returns an iterator for the  matches, and leaves the RegExp object’s properties untouched:  const rex =  \d g; for  const m of "Testing 1 2 3".matchAll rex   {     console.log `"${m[0]}" at ${m.index}, rex.lastIndex: ${rex.lastIndex}` ; }  18 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-Symbol-description 19 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-string-matchall   482  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany     => "1" at 8, rex.lastIndex: 0    => "2" at 10, rex.lastIndex: 0    => "3" at 12, rex.lastIndex: 0  In addition to leaving lastIndex alone, it’s more compact, providing a convenient iterator. It’s espe- cially powerful with destructuring, particularly with named capture groups:  const s = "Testing a-1, b-2, c-3"; for  const {index, groups: {type, num}} of s.matchAll   ? \w - ? \d  g   {     console.log `"${type}": "${num}" at ${index}` ; }    => "a": "1" at 8    => "b": "2" at 13    => "c": "3" at 18  ANNEX B: BROWSER-ONLY FEATURES  Before getting into the meat of this section, just a quick note: you can’t use some of what’s here in  strict mode, and you probably shouldn’t use any of it at all.20 Annex B is about defining legacy behav- ior for JavaScript engines running in web browsers. In new code, don’t rely on legacy behavior.  Given that, two questions might come to your mind:  ➤➤ What’s the point of Annex B? ➤➤ Why include Annex B features, which are by definition legacy features, in a book about   the new toys?  Annex B is in the spec both to document and constrain what JavaScript engines in web browsers do that is  mostly outside the standard language, but which anyone building a JavaScript engine would need to know   and do  if they wanted to use that engine in a web browser dealing with real-world code. The legacy fea- tures that are newly documented in ES2015+ are included in this book  very minimally  for completeness.  What’s in Annex B, then? Some early features of JavaScript were sufficiently problematic  such as  the getYear and setYear methods of dates, as opposed to getFullYear and setFullYear  that  ES2 documented them but with the note that they were “not part of this specification.” ES3 relegated  those things plus some others  like those legacy octal literals that were easily confused for decimal   to an “informational” compatibility section at the end: Annex B. Separately, almost since JavaScript’s  inception browsers have been extending JavaScript beyond what the specification describes, and some  minor features  escape, unescape, etc.  defined by browsers were included in Annex B as a means of  documenting and softly  at that time  specifying the common behavior they had. ES5 added one more  method to the annex, but otherwise didn’t change much.  It was ES2015 that aggressively documented the common behavior  where possible  of a large number  of extensions common to web browsers, and also required for the first time that the features in Annex  B must be provided by browser-hosted JavaScript engines. In theory, JavaScript engines outside of web  browsers don’t implement Annex B features, although in practice an engine built for use both inside and  outside browsers is unlikely to increase complexity by disabling them in non-browser environments.  20  With the one exception of HTML-like comments in a true, properly served XHTML page if the script really needs to   be inline. True, properly served XHTML pages are rare.   Annex B: Browser-Only Features  ❘  483  This section covers the additions to Annex B in ES2015+: HTML-like comments, additions   changes to regular expressions, additional properties and methods on Object.prototype,   String.prototype, and RegExp.prototype, an addition to object initializer syntax, various bits  of loosened or obscure syntax for backward-compatibility, and some really special behavior for  document.all.  But seriously: don’t use them in new code.  HTML-Like Comments  JavaScript engines have long tolerated HTML comments wrapped around script code. This was  primarily to support the practice of “commenting out” inline code in a script tag, either for very  old browsers that didn’t handle the script tag at all  and showed its contents in the document , or  as part of a CDATA wrapper for XHTML browsers. That looks like this  or one of many variations, or  indeed many incorrect attempts at doing this :     <!--    ...code...   -->    Notice how the first thing inside what's supposed to be JavaScript code is an HTML-like comment.  Annex B was updated in ES2015 to specify the behavior.  Regular Expression Tweaks  Annex B changes regular expressions in fairly small ways: a very small extension to control escapes in  character classes, tolerating unmatched closing square brackets  ]  and invalid quantifier groups  {},  {foo} , and adding a compile method.  Control Character Escape  \cX  Extension  Annex B allows digits  in addition to the usual letters  in control escapes  \cX , but only if the control  escape is within a character class  [] . The same formula that applies to letters determines the control  character to match: the code point of X % 32. For example, here's a valid control escape:  console.log  \cC .test "\u0003"  ;    true  That’s true because \cC specifies control character 3  “control c”  because the code point of C is 67  and 67 % 32 is 3.  In standard  non-Annex B  regular expressions, \c can only be followed by an English letter  A–Z,  case-insensitive , as in the previous example. Annex B allows digits after it as well, but only when it’s  in the character class  [ ] . For example:  console.log  [\c4] .test "\u0014"  ;    true console.log  \c4 .test "\u0014"  ;      false console.log  \c4 .test "\\c4"  ;        true  The first example matches \u0014 because the \c4 is in a character class, the code point of 4 is 52,  and 52 % 32 is 20, which is 0x14 in hex. The second example doesn’t match because it’s not in a    484  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  character class, so \c4 isn’t a control escape and falls back to defining a match for \ c 4 as individ- ual characters, as you can see from the third example.  Tolerating Invalid Sequences  A couple of invalid sequences are allowed in Annex B that aren’t allowed by the main specification’s  grammar, such as an unescaped closing square bracket  ]  with no opening one  with an opening one,  it would form a character class, [...] , and an unescaped opening curly brace that doesn’t define a  quantifier. The following work in engines applying Annex B syntax, but would be errors in engines  that didn’t:  const mismatchedBracket =  ] ;      Should be  \]  console.log mismatchedBracket.test "testing ] one two three"  ;    true console.log mismatchedBracket.test "no brackets here"  ;           false const invalidQuanitfier =  {} ;     Should be  \{\}  console.log invalidQuanitfier.test "use curly braces  {} "  ;      true console.log invalidQuanitfier.test "nothing curly here"  ;         false  RegExp.prototype.compile  Annex B adds a compile method to RegExp objects. It completely re-initializes the object on which  it’s called, changing it to a completely different regular expression:  const rex =  ^test ; console.log rex.test "testing"  ;    true rex.compile  ^ing  ; console.log rex.test "testing"  ;    false rex.compile "ing$" ; console.log rex.test "testing"  ;    true  compile accepts essentially the same parameters as the RegExp constructor, including a RegExp  instance as the first parameter  in which case that instance’s pattern and flags are used  or a string as  the first parameter and flags as an optional second parameter. One small difference is that the RegExp  constructor allows you to pass in a RegExp object as the first argument and new flags as a string in  the second argument. RegExp.compile does not, you can't specify new flags if providing a RegExp  instance as the first argument.  Annex B notes that using compile could be used as a signal to the JavaScript engine that the regular  expression is intended to be reused and may be a good candidate for optimization. However, Java- Script engines generally optimize based on measuring live code performance and aggressively optimiz- ing code that is used frequently, so that hint may not be of any value to a given engine.  Additional Built-In Properties  The built-in objects have some additional properties defined by Annex B.  Additional Object Properties  You learned about one of the Annex B additions to objects in Chapter 5: __proto__, both the   accessor property defined on Object.prototype and the additional object initializer syntax for it.   Annex B: Browser-Only Features  ❘  485  Annex B also defines some other properties on Object.prototype for backward-compatibility   with code that relied on extensions SpiderMonkey  Mozilla’s JavaScript engine  added for accessor  properties before the standard had them: __defineGetter__, __defineSetter__, __lookupGetter__,  __lookupSetter__. They do exactly what they sound like they do—define and look up getter and setter  functions for properties:  "use strict"; const obj = {x: 10}; obj.__defineGetter__ "xDoubled", function   {     return this.x * 2; } ; console.log obj.x ;    => 10 console.log obj.xDoubled ;    => 20 try {     obj.xDoubled = 27; } catch  e  {     console.error e.message ;        => Cannot set property xDoubled of   which has only a getter } obj.__defineSetter__ "xDoubled", function value  {     this.x = value   2; } ; obj.xDoubled = 84; console.log obj.x ;           42   console.log obj.__lookupGetter__ "xDoubled" .toString   ;    =>    "function   {        return this.x * 2;    }" console.log obj.__lookupSetter__ "xDoubled" .toString   ;    =>     "function value  {        this.x = value   2;    }"  One non-obvious thing to note is that the “define” methods define the accessor on the object you  call them on, but the “lookup” methods will follow the prototype chain if the object you call them  on doesn’t have the relevant accessor.  This is just like properties: setting a property assigns it to the  object directly, but getting a property goes up the prototype chain.  If the “lookup” method returns a  function, it may be defined on the object itself, its prototype, or its prototype’s prototype, etc.  You wouldn’t use these methods in new code. Instead, you’d use standard accessor property notation   get foo  , set foo    when first creating the object, or if you wanted to add an accessor after the  fact, you’d use Object.defineProperty or Object.defineProperties. To get the function for an  accessor, you’d use Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor  using Object.getPrototypeOf if you  want to follow the prototype chain like the “lookup” methods do .  Additional String Methods  Annex B adds several string methods: substr, and a bunch of methods that wrap the string in  HTML tags.   486  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  Just like substring, substr produces a substring of the string, but it accepts different arguments: the  starting index and length of the substring, instead of substring’s starting and ending indexes. It also  allows the starting index to be negative, in which case it’s an offset from the end of the string:  const str = "testing one two three"; console.log str.substr 8, 3  ;    "one" console.log str.substr -5  ;      "three"  The HTML methods are anchor, big, blink, bold, fixed, fontcolor, fontsize, italics, link,  small, strike, sub, and sup. They literally just put start and end tags on the string:  console.log "testing".sub   ; " testing "  Don’t use them in new code  not least because the majority of those HTML tags are   deprecated anyway .  Various Bits of Loosened or Obscure Syntax  Annex B allows some syntax in loose mode that isn’t in the main specification. None of the following  is valid in strict mode; they all produce syntax errors. Since I strongly recommend using strict mode  in all new code  and it’s the default in modules and class constructs , this is, again, just information  about things you may find in old code.  With Annex B’s syntax, you can put a label in front of a function declaration  provided it’s not a  generator function :  label: function example   { }  There doesn’t seem to be any point to the label, but  as with most Annex B “features”  apparently  it was allowed in an engine back in the day and so engines need to allow it in order to support  obsolete code.  Similarly, you can have a function declaration attached to an if statement  without a block  or its  else  again without a block , like this:  if  Math.random   < 0.5      function example   {         console.log "1" ;     } else     function example   {         console.log "2" ;     } example  ;  try {        ... } catch  e  {     var e;        ... }  Even now that function declarations are allowed in blocks  as you learned in Chapter 3 , that exam- ple would be invalid without Annex B semantics because there aren’t blocks around the function  declarations. For compatibility with old code, they’re allowed in loose mode only.  The loosened syntax also allows you to redeclare the catch binding with var in the catch block:   Annex B: Browser-Only Features  ❘  487   That var could also be in a for or for-in loop initializer, but not a for-of loop initializer.  With- out Annex B syntax, that would be a syntax error. With Annex B syntax, it declares a variable in the  function  or global  scope where the code appears, but e within the catch block is still the catch  binding, and assigning to it assigns to the catch binding, not to the variable:  "use strict"; function example   {     e = 1;     console.log e ;           1     try {         throw new Error "blah" ;     } catch  e  {         var e;                Would be a SyntaxError if not for Annex B syntax         e = 42;         console.log e ;       42     }     console.log e ;           1 } example  ;  Don't do that in new code. But there may be legacy code from 1996 on the web that still has it . . .  Finally  and this is a curious one , did you know that you could put an initializer on the variable in a  for-in loop? You can with Annex B syntax:  const obj = {     a: 1,     b: 2 }; for  var name = 42 in obj  {     console.log name ; }    =>    "a"    "b"  It only works with var, not let or const, and doesn’t work in strict mode. The initializer is evalu- ated and assigned to the variable, and then immediately overwritten by the first property name in the  object, so you never see it in the loop. But an initializer with side-effects is observable:  for  var name = console.log "hi"  in {}  {    "hi" } let n = 1; for  var name2 = n = 42 in {}  { } console.log n ;                               => 42  You’ll never write that, but if you see it in legacy code, at least now you know why it’s not causing an  error and what it does  so you can safely fix it, for instance .  When document.all Isn’t There . . . or Is It?  This one’s fun enough to take a moment to tell the story.  In the early days of the web, document.all was a Microsoft feature in Internet Explorer  IE : a collection  of all of the elements in the document  with various properties for sub-collections of subsets of elements     488  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  that you could iterate over or look elements up in by their id or name. In contrast, Netscape Navigator   the other major browser at the time  used the fledging DOM standard  getElementById and such . Code  written to work with both had to choose which to use. Sometimes programmers did that like this:  if  document.getElementById  {    or various variations        ...use getElementById and other DOM-isms... } else {        ...use document.all and other Microsoft-isms... }  Other times they did it the other way around, which is the problem:  if  document.all  {        ...use document.all and other Microsoft-isms... } else {        ...use getElementById and other DOM-isms... }  In place of if  document.all  they might use if  typeof document.all !== "undefined"  or  if  document.all != undefined , but the intent was the same.  Of course, things moved on, and Microsoft implemented DOM standards, but not all web pages updated  their script. Newer  at the time  browsers like Chrome, looking to support pages even if they were written  for IE, included support for Microsoft-isms like document.all  and the global event variable and such .  Fast forward several years, and any page that checked for document.all instead of checking   for getElementById would work just as well going along its DOM path rather than its Microsoft  path, and browser makers wanted to make that happen. One way, of course, would be to drop   document.all. But browser makers didn’t want to drop support for document.all entirely, because  they wanted to continue to support pages that used it without a check. What to do?  The solution was both ingenious and horrifying: they made document.all the only “falsy” object.  More specifically, they gave it some very interesting features:  ➤➤ It coerces to false instead of true when you coerce it to boolean. ➤➤ When you apply typeof to it, the result is "undefined". ➤➤ When you use == to compare it to null or undefined, the result is true  and of course,    != comparisons are false .  That way, the if  document.all  and similar checks act as though document.all wasn’t there, but code  that doesn’t do a check at all still works, because document.all is there and does still  for now  work.  Annex B defines this functionality for an object with an internal slot called [[IsHTMLDDA]].   document.all is the only such object, at least for now.  TAIL CALL OPTIMIZATION  In theory, ES2015+ requires that a JavaScript engine implement tail call optimization  TCO , which  is primarily useful in situations involving recursion. In fact, only one JavaScript engine supports TCO  and that seems unlikely to change any time soon. More on that in a moment.   Tail Call Optimization  ❘  489  First, a brief reminder about the stack and stack frames. Consider this code:  "use strict"; function first n  {     n = n - 1;     return second n ; } function second m  {     return m * 2; } const result = first 22 ; console.log result ;    42  Without TCO, when the JavaScript engine handles the call to first, it pushes a stack frame on the  stack with the address to return to, the arguments to pass to first  22 , and perhaps some other book- keeping information, then jumps to the beginning of first’s code. When first calls second, the engine  pushes another stack frame on the stack with the return address, etc., in it. When second returns, its  frame is popped off the stack. When first returns, its frame is popped off the stack. See Figure 17-1.  Frame for second call   address : 0x35128647  m: 21  n: 22  ...  Frame for ﬁrst call  Frame for ﬁrst call  Frame for ﬁrst call   address : 0x13245267   address : 0x13245267   address : 0x13245267  n: 22  ...  ...  1. ﬁrst is called  2. ﬁrst calls second  3. second returns  4. ﬁrst returns  n: 22  ...  FIGURE 17-1   Since the stack isn’t infinite, it can only hold so many stack frames before it runs out of room. You’ve  probably accidentally written code that called itself endlessly  directly or indirectly  and seen a stack  overflow error like this one:  RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded  If you look at first, though, you can see that calling second is the very last thing that first does  before returning, and first returns the result of calling second. That means the call to second is a  tail call  a call in the tail position .  With TCO, the engine can pop the stack frame for first off the stack before calling second; it just has  to give second’s stack frame the return address first would have returned to. Other than that return  address, first’s stack frame doesn’t have much purpose, so TCO can eliminate it. See Figure 17-2.  Frame for ﬁrst call  Frame for second call   address : 0x13245267   address : 0x13245267  n: 22  ...  ...  1. ﬁrst is called  2. ﬁrst calls second  3. second returns  m: 21  ...  using TCO  FIGURE 17-2    With this specific example, getting rid of first’s stack frame before calling second doesn’t really  make much difference. But particularly when you’re dealing with recursion, avoiding having those  frames on the stack can make a big difference. For instance, consider this classic factorial function:  490  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  function fact v  {     if  v <= 1n  {         return v;     }     return v * fact v - 1n ; } console.log fact 5n  ;    120   I’m using BigInt in that code so that it’s not limited by the capacity of the number type.  The size of  the stack limits the factorials fact can calculate, because if it starts with a big enough number  say,  100000 , all those stack frames from the recursive calls overflow the stack:  console.log fact 100000n  ;    => RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded  Unfortunately, though, the call fact makes to itself isn’t in the tail position. It’s very near it, but  after the call fact multiplies the result by v and returns that instead. But it’s easy to tweak fact   so that it can take advantage of TCO by adding a second parameter to it and relocating the   multiplication:  function fact v, current = 1n  {     if  v <= 1n  {         return current;     }     return fact v - 1n, v * current ; }  Now, fact’s call to itself is in the tail position. With TCO, each time fact calls itself, the stack  frame for the new call replaces the stack frame for the previous call, just like second’s frame  replaced first’s earlier, instead of all being pushed on the stack until the final result is found,  and then all being popped off. So the stack no longer limits the size of the factorials that fact can  calculate.  But as I mentioned at the beginning of this section, only one major JavaScript engine currently imple- ments TCO: JavaScriptCore in Safari  and other browsers on iOS21 . V8, SpiderMonkey, and Chakra  don’t support TCO, and at least the V8 and SpiderMonkey teams don’t currently have any plans to.   V8 did have partial support for a while, but it was removed as the engine evolved.  The primary  sticking point is the effect on stack traces. Think back to the first second example at the beginning  of this section. Suppose second threw an error. Since first’s stack frame was replaced by second’s  thanks to TCO, the stack trace would look like second had been called where first was called,  instead of from within first. There are various ways to solve this problem, and some suggested  alternatives including opt-in  rather than automatic  TCO, but for now there’s no consensus to move  forward. Maybe someday.  21  On iOS, browsers like Chrome and Firefox can’t use their usual JavaScript engines, because non-Apple apps can’t   allocate executable memory, which is required for the JIT compiling that V8 and SpiderMonkey do. V8 has recently  introduced an “interpreter only” version of V8, though, so Chrome may start using that on iOS.   Old Habits to New  ❘  491  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Use Binary Literals  All of these miscellaneous additions give you a few habits you can update if you like.  Old habit: Using hexadecimal numbers for bit flags and such where binary might be clearer:  New habit: Where it makes sense, use the new binary integer literal instead:  const flags = {     something:       0x01,     somethingElse:   0x02,     anotherThing:    0x04,     yetAnotherThing: 0x08 };  const flags = {     something:       0b00000001,     somethingElse:   0b00000010,     anotherThing:    0b00000100,     yetAnotherThing: 0b00001000 };  Use New Math Functions Instead of Various Math Workarounds  Old habit: Using various math workarounds, for instance to emulate 32-bit integer math, or truncat- ing by doing value = value < 0 ? Math.ceil value  : Math.floor value .  New habit: Where appropriate, use some of the new Math functions instead, like Math.imul or  Math.trunc.  Use Nullish Coalescing for Defaults  Old habit: Using the logical OR operator    or an explicit null undefined check when providing  default values:  const delay = this.settings.delay  300;    or const delay = this.settings.delay == null ? 300 : this.settings.delay;  New habit: Use nullish coalescing instead where appropriate so that not all falsy values  such as 0   trigger the default:  const delay = this.settings.delay ?? 300;  Use Optional Chaining Instead of && Checks  Old habit: Using the logical AND operator  &&  or similar when accessing nested properties on  objects that may or may not be there:  const element = document.getElementById "optional" ; if  element  {     element.addEventListener "click", function   {            ...     } ; }   492  ❘  CHAPTER 17    Miscellany  New habit: Use optional chaining instead where appropriate:  document.getElementById "optional" ?.addEventListener "click", function   {        ... } ;  Leave the Error Binding  e  Off of “catch  e ” When Not Using It  Old habit: Writing catch  e  when not using e  because you had no choice :  New habit: Not writing the  e  part when using modern syntax  transpiling, or only targeting   environments known to support the optional catch binding :  try {     theOperation  ; } catch  e  {     doSomethingElse  ; }  try {     theOperation  ; } catch {     doSomethingElse  ; }  Use the Exponentiation Operator  **  Rather Than Math.pow  Old habit: Using Math.pow for exponentiation, for instance:  x = Math.pow y, 32 ;  New habit: Consider using the exponentiation operator instead, since Math.pow can be overwritten  and using the exponentiation operator doesn’t require the identifier lookup for Math or the property  lookup for pow:  x = y**32;   Upcoming Class Features  WHAT’S IN THIS CHAPTER?  ➤➤ Public class fields  ➤➤ Private class fields, instance methods, and accessors  ➤➤ Static class fields and private static methods  CODE DOWNLOADS FOR THIS CHAPTER  You can download the code for this chapter at https:  thenewtoys.dev bookcode   or https:  www.wiley.com go javascript-newtoys.  In this chapter, you’ll learn about upcoming class features that are almost certain to be in  ES2021, and which are stable enough  or nearly stable enough  to use with transpilation today   or even without, in some cases, in modern environments : class fields; private fields and meth- ods accessors; and static fields and private static methods accessors.  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLASS FIELDS, METHODS,  AND ACCESSORS  ES2015’s class syntax was intentionally just a starting point. Multiple proposals that are likely  to be adopted in ES2021 extend it with additional useful features:  ➤➤ Public field  property  definitions ➤➤ Private fields ➤➤ Private instance methods and accessors   494  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  ➤➤ Public static fields ➤➤ Private static fields ➤➤ Private static methods  These make the already-useful1 class syntax markedly more useful, taking tasks that used to require  hiding things in closures, assignments after-the-fact, behind-the-scenes use of WeakMaps, awkward  syntax, etc., and making them simple syntax, and potentially improving the ways JavaScript engines  can optimize the results as well.  The enhancements are spread across multiple proposals, which may advance at different rates, but  which are all at Stage 3 in early 2020:  ➤➤ Class field declarations for JavaScript  often called the “class fields proposal” :    https:  github.com tc39 proposal-class-fields  ➤➤ Private methods and getter setters for JavaScript classes:    https:  github.com tc39 proposal-private-methods  ➤➤ Static class features: https:  github.com tc39 proposal-static-class-features   This section goes through the various additions. They are supported by transpilers right now. Being  Stage 3, these features are being implemented natively by JavaScript engines  for instance, private and  public fields are available in V8, shipping without a flag in Chrome 74 and up .  Public Field  Property  Definitions  With ES2015’s class syntax, only constructors, methods, and accessor properties were declara- tively defined; data properties were created ad-hoc via assignment, often  but not always  in the  constructor:  class Example {     constructor   {         this.answer = 42;     } }  class Example {     answer = 42; }  The class fields proposal adds public field definitions to the language  essentially, property   definitions . The following defines exactly the same class the previous example did:  The definition is simply the name of the property, optionally followed by an equal sign  =  and an   initializer expression, then terminated with a semicolon  ; .  More on initializers in a moment.   Notice that there is no this. in front of the property name in the definition.  1  Useful if you use constructor functions, that is; JavaScript also supports programming paradigms that don’t use them   and thus, don’t use class syntax.   Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  495  “PUBLIC FIELD” VS. “PROPERTY”  Since the class fields proposal adds private fields to the language, and private fields  aren’t properties  as you’ll learn in the next section , it’s increasingly common to  refer to properties and private fields as simply fields, and by extension to refer to  properties as public fields. Public fields are still properties; this is just another  name for them.  If you have multiple properties to define, they must be defined separately; you can’t chain definitions  like you can with var, let, and const:  class Example {     answer = 42, question = "...";                ^--- SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ";" }  For properties whose initial values don’t rely on constructor parameter values, the new syntax is more  concise. If the initial value does rely on a constructor parameter, then adding the definition is slightly  more verbose  at least for now :  Instead, write each definition standalone:  class Example {     answer = 42;     question = "..."; }  class Example {     answer;       constructor answer  {         this.answer = answer;     } }  In that example the public field definition at the beginning of the class is redundant in terms of the  properties that new Example creates on the newly created object; the object would have the answer  property either way. But public property definitions have been added to the language for several   reasons:  ➤➤ Telling the JavaScript engine up front what properties the object will have reduces the   number of shape changes the object goes through  changes to its set of properties and such ,  which improves the engine’s ability to optimize the object quickly; see the inset.  ➤➤ Defining the shape of the object up front is useful to human readers of your class as well   and provides a convenient location for documentation comments describing the properties.  Remember that you read code much more frequently than you write it, so a bit of extra  effort to help readers is often useful.   496  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  ➤➤ Having this syntax for public properties provides parity with the private field definitions   you’ll learn about in the next section.  ➤➤ It provides a place to apply decorators to the property, if or when the decorators proposal2   goes forward.  It will be down to your style and your team’s style when  and whether  you define public properties  declaratively rather than via assignment.  THE “SHAPE” OF AN OBJECT, AND SHAPE CHANGES  The shape of a JavaScript object is the set of fields and properties it has and what  prototype it has. Modern JavaScript engines optimize objects aggressively; the shape  of an object is an important part of that. Avoiding changing the object’s shape over  time helps the engine do its job more efficiently. For instance, look at the following   class:  class Example {    constructor a  {        this.a = a;    }    addB b  {        this.b = b;    }    addC c  {        this.c = c;    } }  A freshly constructed instance of Example has only one property: a.  Well, very  briefly it has none at all, before a is assigned, but in many cases the JavaScript engine  can avoid re-optimizing if the assignment is at the beginning of the constructor and  unconditional.  But later, it may get a b property, a c property, or both. If that hap- pens, the JavaScript engine has to adjust its optimization each time to allow for the  change. But if you tell the engine up front what properties the object will have  by  assigning to them in an unconditional early part of the constructor, or by defining  them with property definition syntax , it can account for those properties just once  at the outset.  If the property definition has an initializer, that initializer code runs exactly as though it were inside  the constructor  other than that it doesn’t have access to the constructor’s parameters, if any .  Among other things, that means that if you use this in the initializer, it has the same value it has in  the constructor: a reference to the object being initialized. Instance properties created this way are  configurable, writable, and enumerable, exactly as though they’d been created via assignment in the  constructor.  2 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-decorators   Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  497  If the property doesn’t have an initializer, it’s created with the default value undefined:  class Example {     field; } const e = new Example  ; console.log "field" in e ;      true console.log typeof e.field ;    "undefined"  While the class fields proposal is only at Stage 3, its basic features described in this section have long  been used via transpilation. Until JavaScript engines are shipping with this feature in place  V8 and  SpiderMonkey do, others will be soon , you’ll need to transpile to use it, and of course depending on  your target environment you may need to transpile to support older engines for a while.  ARROW FUNCTIONS IN INITIALIZERS  Since an initializer runs as though it were within the constructor, some programmers  have taken to using a property referring to an arrow function as a convenient way to  create a function that’s bound to the instance. For example:  class Example {    handler = event => {        event.currentTarget.textContent = this.text;    };      constructor text  {        this.text = text;    }      attachTo element  {        element.addEventListener "click", this.handler ;    } }  That works because the arrow function closes over this, and this where the arrow  function is defined refers to the instance being initialized  just as though the initial- izer were inside the constructor .  While that seems convenient at first, there are some arguments against doing it. It  puts handler on the instance itself, not Example.prototype, which means:  ➤➤  ➤➤  It’s hard to mock for testing. Often, testing frameworks work at the proto- type level.  It interferes with inheritance. Suppose you had class BetterExample  extends Example and defined a new better handler? It wouldn’t have access  to the Example version via super.   498  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  The alternative is to put the method on the prototype where it can be reused and   possibly  mocked for testing, and bind it to the instance when where necessary. In  this case, you could do that in the constructor, in the attachTo method, or . . . in a  property initializer on a property definition! Like this:  class Example {    handler = this.handler.bind this ;      constructor text  {        this.text = text;    }      handler event  {        event.currentTarget.textContent = this.text;    }      attachTo element  {        element.addEventListener "click", this.handler ;    } }  That takes the prototype’s handler, binds it to this, and assigns the result as   an instance property. Since the initializer runs before the property is created,   this.handler in the initializer refers to the one on the prototype.  This pattern is sufficiently common that it’s one of the example use cases for decora- tors  it’s often called the @bound decorator .  The name of a public field can be computed; to do so, you use brackets around the expression defin- ing the property key like you do in an object literal. It’s particularly useful for when the property key  is a Symbol:  const sharedUsefulProperty = Symbol.for "usefulProperty" ; class Example {     [sharedUsefulProperty] = "example";       show   {         console.log this[sharedUsefulProperty] ;     } }   const ex = new Example  ; ex.show  ;    "example"  Earlier you learned that if the public field definition has an initializer, it runs exactly as though it  were in the constructor. Specifically, they’re done in source code order, as though they were writ- ten right at the beginning of the constructor  in a base class  or just after the call to super    in a    Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  499  subclass—remember that the new instance is created by the super   call, so this isn’t accessible  before then . The order means that a later property can rely on an earlier property, since the earlier  property will be created and initialized first. See Listing 18-1 for an example showing both the order  and the fact that the initialization is done just after the call to super  .  LISTING 18.1:  Public property definition order—property-definition-order.js  function logAndReturn str  {     console.log str ;     return str; } class BaseExample {     baseProp = logAndReturn "baseProp" ;     constructor   {         console.log "BaseExample" ;     } } class SubExample extends BaseExample {     subProp1 = logAndReturn "example" ;     subProp2 = logAndReturn this.subProp1.toUpperCase   ;     constructor   {         console.log "SubExample before super  " ;     super  ;         console.log "SubExample after super  " ;         console.log `this.subProp1 = ${this.subProp1}` ;         console.log `this.subProp2 = ${this.subProp2}` ;     } } new SubExample  ;  When you run Listing 18-1, it outputs:  SubExample before super   baseProp BaseExample example EXAMPLE SubExample after super   this.subProp1 = example this.subProp2 = EXAMPLE  Private Fields  The class fields proposal also adds private fields to class syntax. Private fields are different from  object properties  public fields  in several ways. The key difference is that, as the name implies, only  code within the class can access a private field of the class. See Listing 18-2 for an example. Remem- ber that you may need a transpiler  and appropriate plugin  to run the example, though depending on  when you’re reading this your browser’s JavaScript engine may support private fields natively.  The  plugin for Babel v7 is @babel plugin-proposal-class-properties.    500  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  LISTING 18-2:  Simple private fields example—private-fields.js  class Counter {     value;       constructor start = 0  {         this.value = start;     }       increment   {         return ++this.value;     }       get value   {         return this.value;     } } const c = new Counter  ; console.log c.value ;    0 c.increment  ; console.log c.value ;    1    console.log c.value ;    Would be a SyntaxError  Listing 18-2 defines a Counter class with a private instance field called value. The class increments  value when its increment method is called and returns value’s value from its value accessor  property, but doesn’t let external code directly see or modify value.  Some things to note from that example:  ➤➤ You define a private field the same way you define a public field, marking it private by  simply giving it a name starting with a hash sign   . This  the value part  is called a  private identifier.  ➤➤ To access the field, you use its private identifier  value  in an accessor expression:   this.value.  ➤➤ Code outside the Counter class’s definition can’t access the field, and it’s a syntax error, not   an evaluation error  in most cases; more on that in a moment . That is, it’s the nice proac- tive kind of error that happens during the parsing of the code, not later when the code is  run, so you catch it early.  Private fields have some key differences from object properties:  ➤➤ Private fields can only be created via a private field definition; they cannot be created ad-hoc   through assignment or defineProperty defineProperties. Trying to use an undefined  private field is a syntax error.  ➤➤ The private identifier you write in the code  value in the example  isn’t the actual name  of the field  though it’s the name you use in your code . Instead, under the covers the Java- Script engine assigns the field a globally unique name  called a Private Name  that you, the    Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  501  programmer, never see. The private identifier is effectively a constant in the class defini- tion’s scope that has the Private Name as its value. When accessing the field  for instance,  this.value , the value of the private identifier value is looked up in the current scope  and the resulting Private Name is used to find the field in the object.  More on this in a  moment.  In contrast, with a property name, the name you write in the code is that prop- erty’s actual name.  ➤➤ Private fields are stored separately from object properties, in an internal slot on the object   called [[PrivateFieldValues]], which is  in the specification  a list of name value pairs  though  of course JavaScript engines are free to optimize, since you never see this list directly . The  name is the Private Name, not the private identifier. The reason for this will become clear in  a little bit.  ➤➤ Private fields cannot be removed from an object. If you try to use the delete operator on a   private field, it’s a syntax error  after all, delete removes properties, and private fields aren’t  properties  and there’s no equivalent to delete for private fields. This, combined with the  fact you must define private fields using a field definition, means that the set of private fields  available within the class is fixed; it never changes  which makes it highly optimizable .  ➤➤ Private fields are not accessible through reflection. They aren’t properties, so none of the   property-oriented methods like Object.getOwnPropertyNames or Reflect.ownKeys  applies to them, and there are no new methods on Object or Reflect that allow you to  access them.  ➤➤ Private fields cannot be accessed with brackets notation  this["value"] doesn’t work, for   instance ; in fact, there’s no dynamic mechanism for accessing them at all. The names must  be written using literal notation.  Follow-on proposals may change this.   ➤➤ Private fields are not accessible in subclasses. If class A defines a private field, only code in  class A can access it. If class B subclasses A  class B extends A , code in B cannot access  A’s private field. This is a natural consequence of the private identifier being part of the  class scope: it’s not in scope in the subclass, so you can’t use it.  There’s a nuance here  you'll learn about later, regarding nested classes.   ➤➤ Following on from that point, it’s perfectly fine if class A and class B both have a private field   with the same private identifier  value or whatever . Those fields are completely separate,  since each of them will get its own Private Name, and the private identifier is resolved to  the Private Name using the class’s scope. value in code in class A refers to class A’s private  field, and value in class B refers to class B’s private field.  Let’s look at how private identifiers are resolved to Private Names. You may recall the environment  object from Chapter 2 that variables  and constants  are stored in. Private identifiers are stored in  a similar object called the private name environment. See Figure 18-1  overleaf  for how the private  identifier, private name environment, Private Name, and class instance all relate to one another.  Because private identifiers are lexically scoped  the resolution of an identifier to its Private Name is  scope-based , if you have a nested class  a class within a class , the inner class can access private fields  of the outer class.

That is, nor- mal scoping rules apply to the private identifier  outerField .  This scope-based resolution of private identifiers ensures that they are intimately tied to the class in  which they’re defined. Even if you evaluate the same class definition more than once, resulting in  two copies of the class, the private fields in one copy are not accessible to the other copy, because the  private identifier in one class’s scope has a different Private Name value than the same private identi- fier in the other class’s scope. It’s just like when you have a function that returns a function closing  over a variable or constant:  Both inner functions created there  f1 and f2  close over a constant called id, but those constants  are separate from one another and have different values. It’s exactly the same for the private identi- fiers in classes.  One way you might evaluate the class definition more than once is by loading the same class in mul- tiple realms  for instance, in both a main window and an iframe  and then exchanging data between  the two. But you could have multiple copies of the class within a single realm as well, just by evaluat- ing the class definition more than once  just like the earlier example evaluated the inner function  definition more than once .

Another version is  “TypeError: attempted to get private field on non-instance.”   Counter1 and Counter2 are two separate copies of the same class, so the value in Counter1 isn’t  the same value as in Counter2. They hold different Private Name values, so code in Counter1 can’t  access the value field in an instance created by Counter2 and vice versa. This means code may fail  to access a private field in two different ways:  1.   2.   If the private identifier is undefined in the scope where it’s used. This is a nice early  syntax error.  If the private identifier is defined in the scope where it’s used, but its Private Name value is  used on an object that doesn’t have a private field with that Private Name.  Counter1 and Counter2 are in the second situation. The commented-out code in Listing 18-2 a few  pages back, which tried to use value when it wasn’t in scope at all, was in the first situation.  That’s all you need to know to use private fields in your classes. If you want to dive deeper into the  two-step mechanism  resolving a private identifier to a Private Name, then using the Private Name to  find the field , see Listing 18-5: it shows the code from Listing 18-4, but emulating the private fields  using equivalents to the abstract operations described in the specification.  This emulation is purely  meant to help you understand how private fields work; it’s not a polyfill or anything close to one.

Private Methods  You define a private method simply by putting a  in front of the method name. See Listing 18-6.  LISTING 18-6:  Private methods—private-methods.js  class Example {     value;     x;     y;       constructor x, y  {         this.x = x;         this.y = y;         this.calculate  ;     }       calculate   {            Imagine an expensive operation here...         this.value = this.x * this.y;     }       get x   {         return this.x;     }     set x x  {         this.x = x;         this.calculate  ;     }       get y   {         return this.y;     }     set y y  {         this.y = y;         this.calculate  ;     }       get value   {         return this.value;     } }   const ex = new Example 21, 2 ; console.log `ex.value = ${ex.value}` ;    42    This would be a syntax error:   ex.calculate  ;   508  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  Like private fields, private methods must be defined in the class construct; you can’t add   them to the class afterward as you can with public prototype methods  for instance, via   MyClass.prototype.newMethod = function  . . . . Also like private fields, the method identifier   calculate  is lexically scoped.  But unlike private fields, private methods are not stored in the instance  object  itself; they’re shared  across objects  instances of the class . That means that the calculate in the previous example is not  the same as defining a private field and assigning a function to it. That would create a new function  for every instance, instead of sharing the function across instances.  You might assume that private methods would be put on the prototype object for the class    MyClass.prototype , but that’s not how they’re shared across instances. The exact mechanism for  sharing private methods across instances may change slightly between this writing and the time the  proposal is adopted, so it’s not useful to go too deeply into it here; see the inset if you’re curious. The  key takeaway is that they’re tied to instances of the class but shared across instances.  HOW PRIVATE METHODS ARE LINKED TO OBJECTS  As with private fields, the private identifier for a private method is lexically scoped;  its value is a Private Name. But the Private Name isn’t just a key in a list as it is with  private fields; instead, the Private Name holds the method directly. So the JavaScript  engine looks up the private identifier in the private name environment to get the  Private Name, and then gets the method directly from that Private Name. If that  were all the engine did, you could get the private method “from” any object, doing  x.privateMethod where x is anything, even if it’s not an instance of the class, since  the method is part of the Private Name that privateMethod resolves to. That  would be confusing to say the least, and limiting for further enhancements to the  language, so the specification has an explicit check to ensure that the instance you’re  getting the method “from” is in fact meant to have that method: every private  method has an internal field  called [[Brand]]  which is the brand for the class they’re  a part of, and instances have a list of [[PrivateBrands]] for the classes they belong to.  Before allowing code to get a private method from an instance, the JavaScript engine  ensures that the method’s [[Brand]] is on the instance’s list of [[PrivateBrands]]. Of  course, this is a specification mechanism; engines are free to optimize provided the  external result is as defined by the spec.  This mechanism may change before the proposal is adopted, because several ways  exist to get the same end result. But the fact that private methods are shared between  instances is not going to change.  Private methods can be called with any this value, just like any other method. this does not have to  refer to an instance of the class the method belongs to. For instance, you can use a private method as  a DOM event handler:  class Example {     constructor element  {         element.addEventListener "click", this.clickHandler ;   Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  509      }       clickHandler event  {            Because of how it was hooked up, `this` here is the DOM element            this method was attached to as an event handler         console.log `Clicked, element's contents are: ${this.textContent}` ;     } }  That said, it’s common to want to bind the method to the instance of the class so you can access the  instance’s properties, fields, and other methods.  Otherwise, you’d define a static private method,  which you’ll learn about later in this chapter.  With public methods, you may have used this pattern  shown earlier to do that:  class Example {     clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind this ;       constructor element  {         element.addEventListener "click", this.clickHandler ;     }       clickHandler event  {            ...     } }  Or perhaps you’d do it in the constructor:  class Example {     constructor element  {         this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind this ;         element.addEventListener "click", this.clickHandler ;     }       clickHandler event  {            ...     } }  In both cases, those read clickHandler from the instance  which gets it from the instance’s proto- type, since the instance doesn’t have an own property for it yet , creates a bound function for it, and  assigns that back as an own property on the instance.  You can’t do that using the same name with private methods  you can’t have a private field and a  private method with the same name—see inset on the next page—and you can’t assign to a private  method as though it were a field or property , but you can define a separate private field to assign the  bound function to, and use that:  class Example {     boundClickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind this ;       constructor element  {         element.addEventListener "click", this.boundClickHandler ;     }   510  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres        clickHandler event  {            ...     } }  Or, again, you can do that in the constructor, although you still need the field definition, so having the  initializer on it as in the last example is reasonable:  class Example {     boundClickHandler;       constructor element  {         this.boundClickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind this ;         element.addEventListener "click", this.boundClickHandler ;     }       clickHandler event  {            ...     } }  There’s no need to bind in the definition  or constructor  if you’re only going to use the bound func- tion once as in that example  just bind in the call to addEventListener , but if you’re going to use  that bound function more than once, binding once and reusing the bound function is useful.  PRIVATE IDENTIFIERS MUST BE UNIQUE IN THE CLASS  A private method and a private field cannot have the same identifier. That is, this  is invalid:     INCORRECT class Example {    a;      a   {    SyntaxError: Duplicate private element           ...    } }  While some languages let you do that, it’s confusing if you actually do; JavaScript  doesn’t allow it. In fact, all of the private features you’ll learn about in this chapter  follow that same rule: you can’t have two different class elements  for instance, a  private field and a private method  with the same private identifier in the same class.  Under the covers, this is because the private identifiers all share the same private  name environment.   Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  511  Private Accessors  Private accessors work just like private methods. You name them with a private identifier, and only  code within the class can access them:  class Example {     cappedValue;       constructor value  {            Saving the value via the accessor's setter         this.value = value;     }       get value   {         return this.cappedValue;     }     set value value  {         this.cappedValue = value.toUpperCase  ;     }       show   {         console.log `this.value = ${this.value}` ;     }       update value  {         this.value = value;     } }   const ex = new Example "a" ; ex.show  ;    "this.value = A" ex.update "b"  ex.show  ;    "this.value = B"    ex.value = "c";    Would be a SyntaxError, `value` is private  Private accessors can be useful for debugging, monitoring changes, etc. Just like private methods  and  via the same mechanism , the accessor functions are shared across instances.  Public Static Fields, Private Static Fields, and Private  Static Methods  ES2015’s class syntax only had one static feature: public static methods  methods attached to  the class constructor instead of the prototype given to instances . The “Static class features” proposal  builds on the class fields and private methods proposals to round out the feature grid with static  fields, private static fields, and private static methods.  Public Static Fields  Public static fields create properties on the class constructor. It’s not uncommon to want to do that,  but with ES2015’s class syntax, you had to do it after-the-fact. For instance, if you were writing a    512  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  class and there were a couple of “standard” instances of it that code might want to reuse, you could  make those available as properties of the class by assigning those properties after the class construct:  class Thingy {     constructor label  {         this.label = label;     } } Thingy.standardThingy = new Thingy "A standard Thingy" ; Thingy.anotherStandardThingy = new Thingy "Another standard Thingy" ;   console.log Thingy.standardThingy.label ;           "A standard Thingy" console.log Thingy.anotherStandardThingy.label ;    "Another standard Thingy"  With the new syntax from the “Static class features” proposal, you can do that declaratively instead,  with the static keyword:  class Thingy {     static standardThingy = new Thingy "A standard Thingy" ;     static anotherStandardThingy = new Thingy "Another standard Thingy" ;       constructor label  {         this.label = label;     } }   console.log Thingy.standardThingy.label ;           "A standard Thingy" console.log Thingy.anotherStandardThingy.label ;    "Another standard Thingy"  The public fields are initialized in source code order, so a later field’s initializer can refer to an   earlier field:  class Thingy {     static standardThingy = new Thingy "A standard Thingy" ;     static anotherStandardThingy = new Thingy          Thingy.standardThingy.label.replace "A", "Another"       ;       constructor label  {         this.label = label;     } }   console.log Thingy.standardThingy.label ;           "A standard Thingy" console.log Thingy.anotherStandardThingy.label ;    "Another standard Thingy"  An earlier field’s initializer can’t refer to a later field, though; it’ll get the value undefined because the  property doesn’t exist  yet .  With the new syntax, a static field’s initializer has access to the private features of the class. If you  added it to the class constructor after the fact, it wouldn’t have that access, because the code for it  wouldn’t be within the class scope the private name environment is attached to.   Public and Private Class Fields, Methods, and Accessors  ❘  513  Private Static Fields  The way you define a private static field is, shockingly, to define it like a public static field but name  it with a private identifier. For instance, if you were writing a class that reused instances based on the  parameter value the constructor receives, you might hold the cache of known instances on a private  static field:  class Example {     static cache = new WeakMap  ;       constructor thingy  {         const cache = Example.cache;         const previous = cache.get thingy ;         if  previous  {             return previous;         }         cache.set thingy, this ;     } }   const obj1 = {}; const e1 = new Example obj1 ; const e1again = new Example obj1 ; console.log e1 === e1again ;    true, the same instance was returned const obj2 = {}; const e2 = new Example obj2 ; console.log e1 === e2 ;         false, a new instance was created  Private Static Methods  Finally, rounding things out, you can also define static private methods that are associated with the  class constructor rather than an instance, for private utility methods that don’t need to act on this:  class Example {     static log ...msgs  {         console.log `${new Date  .toISOString  }:`, ...msgs ;     }     constructor a  {         Example.log "Initializing instance, a =", a ;     } }   const e = new Example "one" ;    => "2018-12-20T14:03:12.302Z: Initializing instance, a = one"  As with ES2015’s public static methods, you do need to access them via the constructor  that is,  Example.log rather than just log , since they’re associated with the class constructor.  There may  be a follow-on proposal that augments private methods with class-scoped standalone utility func- tions3 you just call directly.   3  https:  github.com tc39 proposal-static-class-features blob    master FOLLOWONS.mdlexical-declarations-in-class-bodies   514  ❘  CHAPTER 18    Upcoming class FeatUres  OLD HABITS TO NEW  Here are some old habits you might consider switching for new ones using these features.

Some readers may be surprised not to see Decorators1 covered in this chapter. Decorators have been  in the proposals process for some time, and one version or another of the proposal is in wide use via  transpilers and TypeScript. But the proposal is still at Stage 2 and has gone through three major revi- sions, with the initial version of the third  “Static Decorators”  still likely to change markedly before  progressing, so unfortunately it’s too much of a moving target to cover in this chapter.  STAGE 3 PROPOSALS MAY CHANGE  Remember that Stage 3 features may change before they’re completed, and in rare  cases may never be completed. In this chapter you’ll learn about the proposals as  they were in early 2020, but they can change afterward. Refer to each proposal’s  GitHub repo  and https:  thenewtoys.dev  for up-to-date information.  TOP-LEVEL AWAIT  The Top-Level Await proposal,2 at Stage 3 in early 2020, will make it possible to use await at the top  level of a module. Let’s take a look.  Overview and Use Cases  You may remember from Chapter 9 that in an async function you can use await to wait for a prom- ise to settle before continuing with the logic of the function. The Top-Level Await proposal brings that  to modules, allowing top-level module code to wait for a promise to settle before the top-level module  logic continues.  Let’s briefly recap how await works in an async function. Consider this fetchJSON function:  function fetchJSON url, options  {     const response = await fetch url, options ;     if  !response.ok  {         throw new Error "HTTP error " + response.status ;     }     return response.json  ; }  When you call fetchJSON, the code in the function runs synchronously up to and including the call  to fetch, which returns a promise. fetchJSON awaits the promise, which suspends execution of   1 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-decorators 2 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-top-level-await   Top-Level await  ❘  519  fetchJSON, returning a new promise. Once the promise from fetch is settled, the logic in fetchJSON  continues, eventually settling the promise it returned.  It works essentially the same way with top-level await in modules: when the module body is evalu- ated, it runs until it awaits a promise. Then its execution is suspended, resuming later when that  promise settles. Roughly, evaluating the module returns a promise of its exports, rather than returning  them directly, just like an async function returns a promise of its return value rather than returning  its value directly.  With fetchJSON, any code that wants to use the data it returns has to wait for the promise from  fetchJSON to settle. Conceptually, that’s exactly what happens with top-level await in modules as  well: anything that wants to use the module’s exports has to wait for the module’s promise to set- tle. In the case of modules, the thing waiting for the module’s promise isn’t your code  not directly,  anyway , it’s the module loader in your host environment  for instance, the browser or Node.js .  The module loader waits for a module’s promise to settle before finishing loading any modules that  depend on it.  When would you need top-level await?  The generic answer is: any time your module’s exports aren’t useful until something the module loads  asynchronously is available. But let’s look at a couple of specifics.  If your module imports from a dynamically loaded module  a module you load by “calling”  import  , which you learned about in Chapter 13 , and if you need the things you import from it  before your exports can be used, you might await the promise from import  . The proposal gives a  good example of this: loading localization information based on the current browser language. Here’s  that example  slightly modified :  const strings = await import `. i18n ${navigator.language}.js` ;  Assume for that example that this appears in a module that exports a translation function that is  expected to do its work synchronously with the data in strings. That function can’t be used until it  has the strings, so it makes sense to prevent the module from being fully loaded until it has them.  The promise the module waits for doesn’t have to be an import  , though; it can be any promise. For  instance, if the strings came from a database in a Node.js module:  const strings = await getStringsFromDatabase languageToUse ;  Another use case is using import   with await to use a fallback module if the primary module isn’t  available. Continuing our previous example, the module importing the strings could fall back to a  default language if a localization file for navigator.language isn’t available:  const strings = await     import `. i18n ${navigator.language}.js`      .catch    => import `. i18n ${defaultLanguage}.js`  ;   or   let strings; try {     strings = await import `. i18n ${navigator.language}.js` ; } catch {     strings = await import `. i18n ${defaultLanguage}.js` ; }   520  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  Using await at the top level of a module has two important ramifications:  ➤➤ It delays the evaluation of any modules that depend on it until the promise it’s awaiting   is settled.  ➤➤ If the promise it’s awaiting rejects and your code doesn’t handle that rejection, it’s just like  having an uncaught synchronous error in your module’s top-level code—your module load  fails, and so does the module load of any module depending on it.  For those reasons, it’s important only to use top-level await when your module’s exports can’t be  used until the promise you’re awaiting settles.  Example  Let’s look at an example of top-level await. Listing 19-1 has an entry point module  main.js  that  imports from mod1  mod1.js, Listing 19-2 , mod2  mod2.js, Listing 19-3  and mod3  mod3.js, List- ing 19-4 . mod2 uses top-level await.  LISTING 19-1:  Top-level await example—main.js  import { one   } from ". mod1.js"; import { two   } from ". mod2.js"; import { three } from ". mod3.js";   console.log "main evaluation - begin" ;   console.log one, two, three ;   console.log "main evaluation - end" ;  LISTING 19-2:  Top-level await example—mod1.js  console.log "mod1 evaluation - begin" ; export const one = "one"; console.log "mod1 evaluation - end" ;  LISTING 19-3:  Top-level await example—mod2.js  console.log "mod2 evaluation - begin" ;      Artificial delay function function delay ms, value  {     return new Promise resolve => setTimeout    => {         resolve value ;     }, ms  ; }     Top-Level await  ❘  521     export const two = "two";                     Not using top-level `await` export const two = await delay 10, "two" ;    Using top-level `await`   console.log "mod2 evaluation - end" ;  LISTING 19-4:  Top-level await example—mod3.js  console.log "mod3 evaluation - begin" ; export const three = "three"; console.log "mod3 evaluation - end" ;  When I first wrote this chapter, neither Node.js nor any browser had top-level await support and to  run this example you had to install the V8 engine on its own  see the inset . But as we were going to  press, Node.js v14 came out with support behind a --harmony-top-level-await flag, so you can use  that  it might not even be behind a flag anymore by the time you’re reading this . Knowing how to  install and use V8 directly is sometimes still useful, though, so if you’re interested, see the inset.  INSTALLING V8  If you can’t find a browser or version of Node.js that has a cutting-edge feature you  want to try out that you know has just been supported in V8, you can install V8 and  use it directly. One easy way to install V8 is to use the “JavaScript  engine  Version  Updater” tool  jsvu .3 To install jsvu, refer to the instructions on the project’s page.  As of early 2020 they are: 1.  Open a shell  command prompt terminal window . 2.  Use npm install jsvu -g to install jsvu. 3.  Update your PATH to include the directory where jsvu puts executables for the   JavaScript engines:  ➤➤  ➤➤  On Windows: the directory is %USERPROFILE%\.jsvu. Use the Windows  UI to update the PATH to include that directory. On Windows 10 you do  that by clicking the Search icon, typing “environment,” and picking   Edit the system environment variables from the local search results. In  the resulting System Properties dialog box, click the Environment Vari- ables . . . button. In the System variables box, double-click PATH. Click  the New button to add a new entry to the list: %USERPROFILE%\.jsvu  On *nix: the directory is ${HOME} .jsvu. Add it to your path by   adding the following line to your shell’s initialization script  for instance,  ~ .bashrc : export PATH="${HOME} .jsvu:${PATH}"  4.   If you have a shell open, close it and open a new one so it picks up  the new PATH.  3 https:  github.com GoogleChromeLabs jsvu   522  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  Now you can install V8 via jsvu: 1.  2.   3.   In a shell, run jsvu --engines=v8. Since this is the first time you’ve run it, it will have you confirm your operating  system; just press Enter  assuming it’s auto-detected your system correctly . If you’re using Windows: Once V8 is installed, there should be a v8.cmd file  in the .jsvu directory. Type dir %USERPROFILE%\.jsvu\v8.cmd to check; it  should list v8.cmd. But as of early 2020, there’s a Windows-specific issue with  jsvu that prevents it creating the v8.cmd file. If it’s not there, copy it from the  chapter downloads or create it with these contents:      @echo off     "%USERPROFILE%\.jsvu\engines\v8\v8"   --snapshot_blob="%USERPROFILE%\.jsvu\engines\v8\snapshot_blob.bin" %*  4.  Note that there are just two lines; the second line starting with    "%USERPROFILE% is fairly long and word wraps in this inset’s text.  Run the main.js file from the example. If you’re using V8 directly  see the inset , run  v8 --module --harmony-top-level-await main.js  If you’re using Node.js v14 or later, make sure you have a package.json with "type": "module" as  you learned in Chapter 13  there’s one in the chapter downloads , and run  node main.js  or if your version needs the flag:  node --harmony-top-level-await main.js  If you’re using a browser that has top-level await  perhaps behind a flag, or perhaps not , include  main.js with a script type="module" tag in an HTML file and run it.  The console output is:  mod1 evaluation - begin mod1 evaluation - end mod2 evaluation - begin mod3 evaluation - begin mod3 evaluation - end mod2 evaluation - end main evaluation - begin one two three main evaluation - end  The module loader in the host environment fetches and parses the modules, instantiates them  see  Chapter 13  and builds the dependency tree, then starts to evaluate them. If none of the modules used  await, since the tree is just main.js importing from the three modules, they’d each be evaluated in  the order they appear in main.js’s imports. But looking at the output, you can see that mod2 starts  being evaluated but then mod3 is evaluated before mod2 finishes. Here’s what happens:  ➤➤ The module loader evaluates the top-level code in mod1  the first module main.js imports   from ; since it doesn’t use await, it runs all the way through:   Top-Level await  ❘  523  mod1 evaluation - begin mod1 evaluation - end  ➤➤ The loader starts evaluating the top-level code for mod2:  mod2 evaluation - begin  ➤➤ When the code reaches the await, it gets suspended, waiting for the promise to settle. ➤➤ In the meantime, since mod3 doesn’t depend on mod2, the loader evaluates it; mod3 doesn’t   have any await, so it runs all the way through:  ➤➤ When the promise mod2 is awaiting settles, evaluation of mod2 continues; since that was its   ➤➤ Since all of its dependencies are now evaluated, the loader evaluates main.js, which uses the   mod3 evaluation - begin mod3 evaluation - end  only await, it runs to the end:  mod2 evaluation - end  things it imported from the modules:  main evaluation - begin one two three main evaluation - end  Let’s compare that with what would happen if mod2 didn’t use top-level await. Open mod2.js in an  editor and find these two lines:     export const two = "two";                     Not using top-level `await` export const two = await delay 10, "two" ;    Using top-level `await`  Move the comment marker from the beginning of the first line to the beginning of the second,  so you have:  export const two = "two";                     Not using top-level `await`    export const two = await delay 10, "two" ;    Using top-level `await`  Now the module doesn’t use top-level await. Run main.js again. This time, the console output is:  mod1 evaluation - begin mod1 evaluation - end mod2 evaluation - begin mod2 evaluation - end mod3 evaluation - begin mod3 evaluation - end main evaluation - begin one two three main evaluation - end  Note how mod2 was evaluated all the way through before mod3 started being evaluated, since mod2 no  longer awaits a promise.  In the original code, note how mod1 was able to export a const that gets its value from something  being awaited:  export const two = await delay 10, "two" ;    Using top-level `await`   524  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  In that example, it does it all in one statement with an export declaration on it, but it doesn’t have  to be together like that. For instance, when using dynamic import  , the promise gets fulfilled with  the module namespace object of the module that was loaded. Suppose your module needs to use the  example function from the dynamic module locally, and also needs to re-export the value export of  the dynamic module. It could do so like this:  const { example, value } = await import ". dynamic.js" ; export { value }; example "some", "arguments" ;  Or of course, it could just keep a reference to the namespace object, although often it’s best to pick  out the parts you need to enable tree shaking  Chapter 13 :  const dynamic = await import ". dynamic.js" ; export const { value } = dynamic; dynamic.example "some", "arguments" ;  Error Handling  In the “Overview and Use Cases” section earlier, you might have wondered about the fact that  the code didn’t handle rejection of all of the promises. For instance, one of the “fallback” exam- ples was this:  let strings; try {     strings = await import `. i18n ${navigator.language}.js` ; } catch {     strings = await import `. i18n ${defaultLanguage}.js` ; }  That example has code to handle rejection of the promise from the first import  , but nothing to  handle rejection of the promise from the second. That might seem like a red flag, if you’re remember- ing the fundamental promise rule from Chapter 8:  Either handle errors, or propagate the promise chain to your caller.  Does the example code break that rule?  No, but it was reasonable to wonder if it did. It doesn’t for the same reason similar code in an async  function doesn’t break the rule: the module’s promise is rejected if the promise being awaited is  rejected, and the module’s promise is returned to the “caller”  in this case, the module loader , so the  “propagate the promise chain to your caller” rule is implicitly followed. Just like an async function  always returns a promise and any uncaught errors in the function reject that promise, asynchronous  modules always return a promise  to the module loader  and any uncaught errors reject that promise.  The loader handles it by reporting the error through whatever host-defined mechanism there is for  doing that  often a console message of some kind  and marking the module as failed  which makes all  modules that depend on it fail to load .  With the earlier example, what if neither the module for the navigator.language nor the module  for defaultLanguage loads? The module loader fails to load the module that code is in  and any  modules depending on it , reporting that in the console  or similar .  Just like with async functions, you don’t have to propagate the chain to the caller explicitly.  It’s implicit.   WeakRefs and Cleanup Callbacks  ❘  525  WEAKREFS AND CLEANUP CALLBACKS  In this section you’ll learn about the WeakRefs proposal,4 which brings weak references and cleanup  callbacks  also called finalizers  to JavaScript. It’s at Stage 3 as of early 2020 and is being actively  added to JavaScript engines.   A brief side note: If you read the developer documentation from the proposal or other documenta- tion based on it, you might notice strong similarities between the examples and such in this section  and the ones in that documentation. That’s because I was very slightly involved in the proposal: I  wrote the developer documentation for it.   WEAKREFS AND CLEANUP CALLBACKS ARE ADVANCED FEATURES  As the proposal says, correct use of WeakRefs and cleanup callbacks takes careful  thought, and they are best avoided if possible. Garbage collection is complicated and  can seem to occur at odd times. Use them with care!  WeakRefs  Normally, when you have a reference to an object, that object will be retained in memory until and  unless you release your reference to it  if there aren’t any others . That’s true whether you have a  direct reference or an indirect one via some intermediary object or objects. That’s a normal object  reference, also called a strong reference.  Using a WeakRef, you can have a weak reference to an object instead. A weak reference doesn’t  prevent the object from being garbage collected  aka reclaimed  if the JavaScript engine’s garbage col- lector decides to reclaim the object’s memory.  You create a WeakRef with the WeakRef constructor, passing in the object you want a weak reference  to  its target, also known as a referent :  const ref = new WeakRef {"some": "object"} ;  If you need to use the object, you can get a strong reference from the WeakRef using its deref   “dereference”  method:  let obj = ref.deref  ; if  obj  {        ...use `obj`... }   And then at some point you let obj go out of scope or you assign undefined or null to it, etc., so  the strong reference is released.   The deref method returns the target object held by the WeakRef, or undefined if the target has been  reclaimed.  4 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-weakrefs   526  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  Why would you want to have a reference to an object that might disappear if the garbage collector  decides to reclaim its memory? One of the major use cases is caching. Suppose your page app has  some data resources that are expensive to retrieve from storage  and won’t be cached by your host  environment , and the specific resources it needs varies across the lifetime of the page app. When  you get a resource the first time, you could save it in a cache using a weak reference, so that if the  page needs it again later, it may be able to avoid the expensive retrieval if the resource hasn’t been  reclaimed in the meantime.  A real-world cache would probably hold the most frequently or recent  used entries strongly and use weak references for the rest.   Another use case is detecting resource leaks through a combination of WeakRefs and cleanup call- backs; you’ll learn about that in the next section.  Let’s look at a basic example using WeakRef. See Listing 19-5. It creates an ArrayBuffer occupying  100 million bytes and keeps a weak reference to it. Then it periodically allocates other ArrayBuffer  instances, keeping strong references to them, and checks to see if the weakly held ArrayBuffer  the  one held via the WeakRef  has been reclaimed. Eventually, the JavaScript engine’s garbage collector is  likely to decide to reclaim the large initial ArrayBuffer that’s only weakly held.  LISTING 19-5:  WeakRef example—weakref-example.js  const firstSize = 100000000; console.log `main:    Allocating ${firstSize} bytes of data to hold weakly...` ; let data = new ArrayBuffer firstSize ; let ref = new WeakRef data ; data = null;    Releases the strong reference, leaving us with only the weak ref let moreData = []; let counter = 0; let size = 50000;   setTimeout tick, 10 ;   function tick   {     ++counter;     if  size < 100000000  {         size *= 10;     }     console.log  ;     console.log `tick ${counter} : Allocating ${size} bytes more data...` ;     moreData.push new ArrayBuffer size  ;     console.log `tick ${counter} : Getting the weakly held data...` ;     const data = ref.deref  ;     if  data  {         console.log `tick ${counter} : weakly held data still in memory.` ;            This `if` is just a sanity check to avoid looping forever if the weakly            held data is never reclaimed.         if  counter < 100  {             setTimeout tick, 10 ;         } else {   WeakRefs and Cleanup Callbacks  ❘  527              console.log `tick ${counter} : Giving up` ;         }     } else {         console.log `tick ${counter} : weakly held data was garbage collected.` ;     } }  Node.js v14 has support for WeakRefs behind a flag  it may not be behind a flag by the time you read  this  and they’re supported in the nightly version of Firefox as of early 2020. To run the example in  Node.js v14:  node --harmony-weak-refs weakref-example.js  Or if you have V8 installed on its own  see the “Installing V8” inset in the “Top-Level await” section  earlier in this chapter , you can run it in V8:  v8 --harmony-weak-refs weakref-example.js  The output will vary depending on your system, but it will look something like this:  main:    Allocating 100000000 bytes of data to hold weakly...   tick 1 : Allocating 500000 bytes more data... tick 1 : Getting the weakly held data... tick 1 : weakly held data still in memory.   tick 2 : Allocating 5000000 bytes more data... tick 2 : Getting the weakly held data... tick 2 : weakly held data still in memory.   tick 3 : Allocating 50000000 bytes more data... tick 3 : Getting the weakly held data... tick 3 : weakly held data still in memory.   tick 4 : Allocating 500000000 bytes more data... tick 4 : Getting the weakly held data... tick 4 : weakly held data still in memory.   tick 5 : Allocating 500000000 bytes more data... tick 5 : Getting the weakly held data... tick 5 : weakly held data was garbage collected.  In that output, you can see that between the fourth and fifth calls to tick, V8 reclaimed the weakly  held buffer.  It may run much longer than this example did; it varies a fair bit.   Here are some closing notes on WeakRefs:  ➤➤ If your code has just created a WeakRef for a target object, or has gotten a target object  from a WeakRef’s deref method, that target object will not be reclaimed until the end of  the current JavaScript job5  including any promise reaction jobs that run at the end of a  script job . That is, you can only “see” an object get reclaimed between turns of the event  loop. This is primarily to avoid making the behavior of any given JavaScript engine’s gar- bage collector apparent in code—because if it were, people would write code relying on that   5  You may remember from Chapter 8 that a job is a unit of work that the thread will run from beginning to end without  running anything else, and that there are script jobs  such as the initial execution of a script, a timer callback, an event  callback  and promise jobs  callbacks to promise fulfillment, rejection, and finally handlers .   528  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  behavior, which would break when the garbage collector’s behavior changed.  Garbage col- lection is a hard problem; JavaScript engine implementers are constantly refining   and improving how it works.  If you were wondering why the earlier example used   setTimeout, it’s because of this aspect of WeakRefs. If the example just called tick in a  loop, the weakly-held ArrayBuffer would never be reclaimed.  ➤➤ If multiple WeakRefs have the same target, they’re consistent with one another. The result   of calling deref on one of them will match the result of calling deref on another of  them  in the same job , you won’t get the target object from one of them but undefined  from another.  ➤➤ If the target of a WeakRef is also in a FinalizationRegistry  which you’ll learn about in a   bit , the WeakRef’s target is cleared before or at the same time any cleanup callback associ- ated with the registry is called.  ➤➤ You cannot change the target of a WeakRef. It will always only ever be the original target   object, or undefined when that target has been reclaimed.  ➤➤ A WeakRef might never return undefined from deref, even if nothing strongly holds the   target, because the garbage collector may never decide to reclaim the object.  Cleanup Callbacks  The WeakRefs proposal also provides cleanup callbacks, also known as finalizers.  A cleanup callback is a function that the garbage collector may call when an object has been  reclaimed. Unlike the finalizers, destructors, and similar in some other languages, in JavaScript the  cleanup callback does not receive a reference to the object that is being or was reclaimed. In fact, as  far as your code can tell, the object has already been reclaimed before your cleanup callback is called   and it’s likely that it actually has been, but that’s a detail for the garbage collector implementa- tion . Designing it this way avoids the problem some other environments have had with complexi- ties around what happens when an object that was unreachable  your code has no way to access  it  becomes reachable again  because the finalizer receives a reference to the object and stores it  somewhere . JavaScript’s approach  not providing the object to cleanup callbacks  makes it easier to  reason about cleanup callbacks, and makes things more flexible for engine implementers.  Why would you want a cleanup callback?  One use case is releasing other objects associated with the reclaimed object. For example, if you have  a cache of WeakRefs weakly holding objects, and one of those objects is reclaimed, the cache still has  its entry for that object in memory—the key and the WeakRef at a minimum, perhaps some other  information. You can use a cleanup callback to release that cache entry when the target object related  to it is reclaimed. This use case isn’t limited to WeakRefs, though; there are other times you might  have objects you don’t need any more if another object is reclaimed, such as a Wasm object you could  release if a corresponding JavaScript object is garbage collected, or a cross-worker proxy, where you  have a proxy in one thread  typically the main one  for an object in a worker thread. If the proxy is  garbage collected, the worker object can be released.  Another use case is detecting and reporting resource leaks. Suppose you have a class that represents  an open file or a database connection or similar. Developers using the class are supposed to call its  close method when done with it, which releases the file descriptor or closes the database connection,    WeakRefs and Cleanup Callbacks  ❘  529  etc. If a user doesn’t call close and just releases the object, your class won’t release the file descrip- tor or the underlying database connection. In a long-running program, that could eventually cause a  problem when the process runs out of file descriptors or the database reaches its limit of concurrent  connections from the same client. You can use a cleanup callback to provide a warning message to the  developer that they’ve failed to call close. The cleanup callback may also be able to release the file  descriptor or database connection, but its primary purpose would be alerting the developer to their  mistake so they can correct their code by making it call close.  We’ll come back to both of those use cases in a moment, including why you wouldn’t just use the  cleanup callback to release the external resources in that second example. For now, let’s look at how  you actually use cleanup callbacks.  To request cleanup callbacks, you create a finalization registry via the FinalizationRegistry con- structor, passing in the function you want called:  const registry = new FinalizationRegistry heldValue => {        ....do your cleanup here... } ;  Then you register objects with the registry to get callbacks for them, using its register method. For  each target object, you pass in the object and a held value for it  "some value" in this example ,  like this:  registry.register theObject, "some value" ;  The register method takes three arguments:  ➤➤ target: The object you want a finalization callback for. The registry does not hold a strong   reference to the object, as that would prevent it from being garbage collected.  ➤➤ heldValue: A value the registry will hold in order to provide it to your cleanup callback if  the target object is reclaimed. This can be a primitive or an object. If you don’t supply any,  undefined is used.  ➤➤ unregisterToken:  Not shown in the preceding example.  An optional object to use later to   unregister the target if you no longer need a cleanup callback for it. More on this in a bit.  Once you’ve registered the target object, if it’s reclaimed, your cleanup callback may be called at some  point in the future with the held value you provided for it. That’s where you do your cleanup, perhaps  using information from the held value. The held value  also called a “memo”  can be any value you  like, a primitive or an object, even undefined. If the held value is an object, the registry keeps a  strong reference to it  so it can pass it to your cleanup callback later , meaning the held value will not  be reclaimed unless the target object is reclaimed  which removes the entry for it from the registry  or  you unregister the target object.  If you might want to unregister an object later, you pass a third argument to register, the unreg- istration token mentioned earlier. It’s common to use the object itself as the unregister token, which  is just fine. When you no longer need a cleanup callback for the object, call unregister with the  unregistration token. Here’s an example using the target object itself:  registry.register theObject, "some value", theObject ;    ...some time later, if you don't care about `theObject` anymore... registry.unregister theObject ;   530  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  It doesn’t have to be the target object, though; it can be a different one:  registry.register theObject, "some value", tokenObject ;    ...some time later, if you don't care about `theObject` anymore... registry.unregister tokenObject ;  The registry keeps only a weak reference to the unregistration token, not least because it may be the  target object itself.  Let’s look at an example from the proposal  slightly modified , a hypothetical FileStream class:  class FileStream {     static cleanUp fileName  {         console.error `File leaked: ${fileName}!` ;     }        static finalizationGroup = new FinalizationRegistry FileStream.cleanUp ;        file;        constructor fileName  {         const file = this.file = File.open fileName ;         FileStream.finalizationGroup.register this, fileName, this ;            ...eagerly trigger async read of file contents...     }        close   {         FileStream.finalizationGroup.unregister this ;         File.close this.file ;            ...other cleanup...     }        async *[Symbol.iterator]   {            ...yield data from file...     } }  You can see all the parts at work there: creating the FinalizationRegistry, adding objects to it,  responding to cleanup callbacks, and unregistering objects from the registry when they’re explic- itly closed.  This is an example of the second use case you learned about earlier. If the user of the FileStream  class doesn’t call close, the underlying File object is never closed, potentially resulting in a leaked  file descriptor. So the cleanup callback logs the filename to warn the developer it was never closed, so  they can fix their code.  Looking at that, you may be thinking “Why wouldn’t you just always use the cleanup callback to  release those resources? Why have a close method at all?”  The answer is: because you may never receive a cleanup call, and if you do, it may be much later  than you expect. Earlier I said “. . . a function that the garbage collector may call when an object has  been reclaimed . . .” not “. . . a function that the garbage collector will call when an object has been    WeakRefs and Cleanup Callbacks  ❘  531  reclaimed . . .” There is no guarantee that the garbage collector will call a cleanup callback in any  given implementation. From the proposal:  The proposed specification allows conforming implementations to skip calling   finalization callbacks for any reason or no reason.  That means you can’t use cleanup callbacks to manage external resources. In terms of that second use  case  and the FileStream example , your file or database API needs that close method, and devel- opers need to call it. The reason for having a cleanup callback in that API is so that if a developer is  working on a platform with cleanup callbacks and releases an object from your API without calling  close, your API can warn them they didn’t call close. Their code may run later on a platform where  cleanup callbacks aren’t called.  However, signs are good that major JavaScript engines will call cleanup callbacks in normal cir- cumstances. There are a couple of circumstances where they’re unlikely to, though, even if they  do normally:  ➤➤ If the JavaScript environment is being torn down  for instance, closing a window or tab in a   browser . In most cases this would make any cleanup your code did redundant.  ➤➤ If the FinalizationRegistry object the callback is associated with is released by your   code  you no longer have a reference to it . If you’ve released your reference to the registry,  it makes little sense to keep it in memory and performing callbacks. If you want them, don’t  release the registry.  But if cleanup callbacks may not happen, what about caches using WeakRefs? If you can’t rely on  cleanup callbacks to remove entries for reclaimed objects, should you do some kind of incremental  scan for entries whose deref returns undefined?  Guidance from the people behind the proposal is no, don’t do that. It complicates the code unnec- essarily for a relatively small gain  freeing up a bit more memory , and for an active cache you’re  likely to discover and replace those entries organically anyway  when the resource for them is  requested again .  Let’s see cleanup callbacks in action. See Listing 19-6.  LISTING 19-6:  Cleanup callback example—cleanup-callback-example.js  let stop = false; const registry = new FinalizationRegistry heldValue => {     console.log `Object for '${heldValue}' has been reclaimed` ;     stop = true; } ; const firstSize = 100000000; console.log `main:    Allocating ${firstSize} bytes of data to hold weakly...` ; let data = new ArrayBuffer firstSize ; registry.register data, "data", data ; data = null;    Releases the reference let moreData = [];   532  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  let counter = 0; let size = 50000;   setTimeout tick, 10 ;   function tick   {     if  stop  {         return;     }     ++counter;     if  size < 100000000  {         size *= 10;     }     console.log  ;     console.log `tick ${counter} : Allocating ${size} bytes more data...` ;     moreData.push new ArrayBuffer size  ;        This `if` is just a sanity check to avoid looping forever if the weakly held        data is never reclaimed or the host never calls the cleanup callback.     if  counter < 100  {         setTimeout tick, 10 ;     } }  Node.js v14 and V8 itself both have WeakRefs behind a flag, but depending on which version of them  you have, they may have the older semantics rather than the new ones, the proposal changed a bit  late in the process. You can run the example like this:   V8: v8 --harmony-weak-refs cleanup-callback-example.js  Node: node --harmony-weak-refs cleanup-callback-example.js  If you get an error saying FinalizationRegistry is not defined, or if you see “Object for ‘[object  FinalizationRegistry Cleanup Iterator]’ has been reclaimed” instead of “Object for ‘data’ has been  reclaimed” when the callback is called, run the code from cleanup-callback-example-older- semantics.js instead.  When you run the code, it outputs something similar to:  main:    Allocating 100000000 bytes of data to hold weakly...   tick 1 : Allocating 500000 bytes more data...   tick 2 : Allocating 5000000 bytes more data...   tick 3 : Allocating 50000000 bytes more data...   tick 4 : Allocating 500000000 bytes more data... Finalizer called Object for 'data' has been reclaimed  That output shows that the object was garbage collected after the fourth timer call.   RegExp Match Indices  ❘  533  Finally, FinalizationRegistry objects have an optional method, cleanupSome, that can be called  to trigger callbacks for an implementation-chosen number of objects in the registry that have been  reclaimed but whose callbacks have not yet been called:  registry.cleanupSome?.  ;  Normally, you don’t call this function. Leave it to the JavaScript engine’s garbage collector to do  the cleanup as appropriate. This function primarily exists to support long-running code which  doesn’t yield to the event loop, which is more likely to come up in WebAssembly than ordinary   JavaScript code.  You can give cleanupSome a different callback from the one registered on the registry object to over- ride it just for these cleanup callbacks:  registry.cleanupSome?. heldValue => {        ... } ;  Even if there are pending callbacks, the number triggered by a call to cleanupSome is implementa- tion-defined. An implementation might not do any of them, might do all pending ones, or somewhere  in between.  Note that the preceding examples use the optional chaining syntax you learned about in Chapter 17,  so that if an implementation doesn’t define cleanupSome, the call is skipped without an error.  REGEXP MATCH INDICES  The match array returned by RegExp.prototype.exec has an index property giving the index in  the string where the match occurred, but doesn’t say where the capture groups occurred. The RegExp  Match Indices proposal6 changes that by adding an indices property. The indices property con- tains an array of [start, end] arrays. The first entry is for the overall match; the subsequent ones  are for the capture groups.  Here’s an example:  const rex =   \w+   \d+  ; const str = "==> Testing 123"; const match = rex.exec str ; for  const [start, end] of match.indices  {     console.log `[${start}, ${end}]: "${str.substring start, end }"` ; }  That regular expression searches for a series of “word” characters followed by a space and a series  of digits. Both the word and the digits are captured. On an implementation with match indices, the  output of that example is:  [4, 15]: "Testing 123" [4, 11]: "Testing" [12, 15]: "123"  6 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-regexp-match-indices   534  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  The new feature supports named capture groups, too. You may remember from Chapter 15 that if  you have named capture groups in the expression, the match array will have an object property called  groups with the contents of the named groups. This proposal does the same by providing the indices  of the group contents on match.indices.groups:  const rex =   ? \w+   ? \d+  ; const str = "==> Testing 123"; const match = rex.exec str ; for  const key of Object.keys match.groups   {     const [start, end] = match.indices.groups[key];     console.log          `Group "${key}" - [${start}, ${end}]: "${str.substring start, end }"`      ; }  That example gives names to the two capture groups from the previous example, and uses   match.groups and match.indices.groups to get information about those named groups. The  output is:  Group "word" - [4, 11]: "Testing" Group "num" - [12, 15]: "123"  With named capture groups and indices arrays, the match array has become quite a rich object.  Here’s the complete match array  including its non-array properties  for the preceding example in  pseudo-JSON format  “pseudo” because it uses square brackets indicating arrays, but also has name:  value pairs for the array’s additional non-array properties :  [     "Testing 123",     "Testing",     "123",     index: 4,     input: "==> Testing 123",     "groups": {         word: "Testing",         num: "123"     },     "indices": [         [4, 15],         [4, 11],         [12, 15],         "groups": {             "word": [4, 11],             "num": [12, 15]         }     ] ]   Atomics asyncWait  ❘  535  STRING.PROTOTYPE.REPLACEALL  For years, people new to the JavaScript String.prototype.replace method have been making the  same mistake: not realizing that it only replaces the first occurrence if you pass it a string or non- global regular expression. For example:  console.log "a a a".replace "a", "b"  ;    "b a a", not "b b b"  To replace all occurrences, you have to pass in a regular expression with the global flag:  console.log "a a a".replace  a g, "b"  ;    "b b b"  That’s not too bad when the text you want to change is text you’re typing literally, but if it’s from  user input or similar, you have to escape characters that have special meaning in regular expressions   and there’s no built-in function for that, despite an effort some years back to add one .  The replaceAll proposal7 makes it much easier, by replacing all occurrences:  console.log "a a a".replaceAll "a", "b"  ;    "b b b"  The replaceAll method behaves identically to replace except in two ways:  ➤➤ If you pass a string to it as the search argument, it replaces all occurrences instead of just   the first—which is the whole point of replaceAll!  ➤➤ If you pass a regular expression without the global flag, it throws an error. This is to   avoid confusion. Does the lack of a global flag mean “don’t replace all?” Or is the flag just  ignored? The answer as of this proposal is to throw an error.  The replaceAll and replace methods do exactly the same thing if you pass them a regular expres- sion with the global flag.  ATOMICS ASYNCWAIT  In Chapter 16 you learned about shared memory and the Atomics object, including its wait method.  Briefly recapping, it’s possible to use Atomics.wait to synchronously wait on a location in a shared  memory until “notified”  via Atomics.notify  by another thread. You can use Atomics.wait in  worker threads, but typically not in the main thread  for instance, the main browser thread, or   Node.js’s main thread , since those must be non-blocking.  The Stage 3 Atomics.asyncWait proposal8 makes it possible to wait for a notification on a shared  memory location without blocking, by using a promise. When you call Atomics.asyncWait, instead  of getting a string return value as with Atomics.wait, you get a promise that will be fulfilled with a  string instead. The possible fulfillment strings are the same as the strings returned by Atomics.wait:  ➤➤ "ok" if the thread was “suspended” and subsequently resumed  rather than timing out   7 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-string-replaceall 8 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-atomics-wait-async   536  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  ➤➤ "timed-out" if the thread was “suspended,” and resumed because the timeout was reached ➤➤ "not-equal" if the thread wasn’t “suspended” because the value in the array wasn’t equal to   the given value  “Suspended” is in quotes in that list because the main thread is never literally suspended as worker  threads are by Atomics.wait, it’s just that the promise remained unsettled for some period of time.  The promise from asyncWait is never rejected, it’s always fulfilled with one of the three strings listed.  For example, if you had a SharedArrayBuffer called sharedArray, you could have the main thread  wait for a notification at the index index like this:  Atomics.asyncWait sharedArray, index, 42, 30000  .then result => {        ...here, `result` will be "ok", "timed-out", or "not-equal"... } ;  If the value at sharedMemory[index] isn’t 42 as of when the JavaScript engine checks it, the fulfill- ment callback will see the string "not-equal". Otherwise, the engine will wait for a notification  before fulfilling the promise. If there’s no notification before the timeout  30000 milliseconds in this  example , it will fulfill the promise with the string "timed-out". If it gets a notification, it fulfills the  promise with the string "ok".  As usual with shared memory and threads, Here There Be Dragons. See Chapter 16 for details of the  dangers and pitfalls.  VARIOUS SYNTAX TWEAKS  In this section, you’ll learn about some minor syntax tweaks that are being done by various  proposals.  Numeric Separators  Sometimes, a numeric literal can be a bit hard to read:  const x = 10000000;  Quick, is that 100 thousand? A million? 10 million? 100 million?   When writing numbers for people to read, we tend to group the digits in some way. For instance, in  some cultures they’re put in groups of three with commas in between: 10,000,000.  The numeric separators proposal9  currently at Stage 3  allows underscores as separators in  numeric literals:  const x = 10_000_000;  That makes it much easier to see that the number is 10 million.  You can use numeric separators in decimal literals  both in the whole number part and the fractional  part , binary literals, hexadecimal literals, and modern octal literals.  9 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-numeric-separator   Legacy Deprecated REGEXP Features  ❘  537  You’re allowed to put separators anywhere you want except:  ➤➤ Immediately after the number base prefix:  ➤➤ Immediately next to a decimal point:  Invalid: 0x_AAAA_BBBB Valid: 0xAAAA_BBBB  Invalid: 12_345_.733_444 Invalid: 12_345._733_444 Valid: 12_345.733_444  ➤➤ At the end of the number, after the last digit:  Invalid: 12_345_ Valid: 12_345  ➤➤ Next to another separator:  Invalid: 10__123_456 Valid: 10_123_456  Hashbang Support  You also can’t start a number with an underscore, like this: _1234. That’s an identifier, not a number.  It’s common for command-line interface hosts  like Node.js  to allow a JavaScript file to start with a  “hashbang” like this:  ! home tjc bin node bin node console.log "Hello from Node.js command line script" ;  Technically, that was invalid syntax per the specification. So the specification is being updated10 to  allow it  Stage 3 at present .  LEGACY DEPRECATED REGEXP FEATURES  A Stage 3 proposal11 is standardizing, but officially deprecating, some long supported “features” of  RegExp that are not in the specification. For instance, capture groups aren’t only available in the  match object you get from exec, but also as properties on the RegExp function itself  not the RegExp  instance, the function  as $1 for the first capture group, $2 for the second, etc., through $9:  const s = "Testing a-1 b-2 c-3"; const rex =   \w - \d  g;  10  https:  github.com tc39 proposal-hashbang 11 https:  github.com tc39 proposal-regexp-legacy-features   538  ❘  CHAPTER 19    A Look AheAd . . .  while  rex.exec s   {        NOT RECOMMENDED!     console.log `"${RegExp.$1}": "${RegExp.$2}"` ; }    => "a": "1"    => "b": "2"    => "c": "3"  The proposal may codify another legacy feature as well, but as of early 2020 that wasn’t certain.  Don’t start using these static properties on RegExp. The reason they’re being standardized is to ensure  consistent behavior across implementations, in particular in relation to being able to remove them:  the proposal makes it possible to remove these properties via delete. Consider that if your code  uses capture groups, any code anywhere in the codebase can see the results of the last match done via  these static properties RegExp.$1, etc. The proposal redefines them so security-conscious code can  delete them after doing a match.  The proposal also ensures that these legacy features aren’t supplied by subclasses of RegExp, since  subclasses of RegExp may adjust the information they provide without considering the effect on the  legacy features.  THANK YOU FOR READING!  Most of the proposals covered in this chapter are things you couldn’t do before, so there isn’t much  in the way of new habits to call out, other than: use these new features where it seems appropriate to  you, taking note of the warnings in a couple of places.  So instead of Old Habits to New, I’ll say: Thank you for reading! I hope you’ve found this book use- ful. Don’t forget to tune into the things that are coming down the pike as you learned in Chapter 1,  and on the book’s website at https:  thenewtoys.dev. Happy coding!

JavaScript is a rapidly changing language and it can be challenging to keep up with all the new toys being added. JavaScript: The New Toys explores the newest features of the world's most popular programming language while also showing readers how to track what's coming next. After setting the stage by covering who manages the process of improving JavaScript, how new features get introduced, terminology, and a high-level overview of new features, it details each new or updated item in depth, with example uses, possible pitfalls, and expert recommendations for updating old habits in light of new features. Covers all the additions to JavaScript in ES2015-ES2019 plus a preview of ES2020 (and beyond). Explores the latest syntax: nullish coalescing, optional chaining, let and const, class syntax, private methods, private fields, new.target, numeric separators, BigInt, destructuring, default parameters, arrow functions, async functions, await, generator functions, … (rest and spread), template literals, binary and octal literals, ** (exponentiation), computed property/method names, for-of, for-await-of, shorthand properties, and others. Details the new features and patterns including modules, promises, iteration, generators, Symbol, Proxy, reflection, typed arrays, Atomics, shared memory, WeakMap, WeakSet, and more. Highlights common pitfalls and explains how to avoid them. Shows how to follow the improvements process and even participate in the process yourself. Explains how to use new features even before they're widely supported. With its comprehensive coverage and friendly, accessible style, JavaScript: The New Toys provides an invaluable resource for programmers everywhere, whether they work in web development, Node.js, Electron, Windows Universal Apps, or another JavaScript environment
