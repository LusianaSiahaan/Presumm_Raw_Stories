Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  Priyanka Rathee  Abstract The blockchain is emerging rapidly as a current area of research these days. The blockchain is a technology used to run bitcoin. It is distributed database maintaining a list of record growing continuously called blocks in order to ensure the security of those blocks from revision and tampering. Every block is connected to other blocks by maintaining the hash of the previous block in the chain. This chapter discusses the technical aspects of blockchain and IoT. The IoT is merely not a concept these days. It is the necessity of time in everyday life. The “smartphone” is the most familiar application of IoT in the day-to-day life. The application of IoT is not limited to smart homes. It is ranging from industrial and commercial sectors to agriculture, public safety, and the health sector. The IoT can also be considered as “Internet of Everything  IoE ” because of a wide range of real-life applications of IoT.  Keywords Bitcoin· Blockchain· IoT  1 Introduction  The blockchain principle was introduced initially for bitcoin, which provides widely distributed and secured database. In IoT, there is a network of multiple devices which communicate with each other without direct human intervention. It facilitates quick transfer of data in an efﬁcient manner. The IoT-enabled devices leads to operational improvements in terms of efﬁciency, performance, and safety. The IoT can also be thought of as a one unit global network. The implementation of IoT applications also projects revenue and growth in the IoT market. The IoT consists of intelligent devices or machines which communicate to other devices, things, machines objects, or infrastructure. Things in IoT referred to objects of physical as well as a virtual world which has the capacity to integrate within the communication network. It can be static or dynamic. P.

Rathee  1.1 Background and Motivation  First, we need to understand two basic terms. One is bitcoin and another one is blockchain. The digital coin is called bitcoin. It is money which is digital. The blockchain is a technology which helps the transmission of digital coins or assets from one person to another person. It is very important to note that bitcoin is different from the blockchain. Now after understanding the basic meaning of bitcoin and blockchain, what are the problems a blockchain attempts to solve? One problem is money transfer. I will be explaining it conceptually. In this section, I’m going to focus on concept rather than implementation details. For example, a person A wants to transfer money to person B. It is usually performed with the help of a third trusted party. The working of blockchain is described as follows: A sends the money to the third party and the third party identiﬁes the B as the right person account to transfer. This took 3–4 days typically. What blockchain does here? Blockchain avoids involving the third party and therefore perform the action faster and cheaper than the traditional method.  Internet of Things The IoT is merely not a concept these days. It is the necessity of time in everyday life. The “smartphone” is the most familiar application of IoT in the day-to-day life. The application of IoT is not limited to smart homes. It is ranging from industrial and commercial sectors to agriculture, public safety, and the health sector. The IoT can also be considered as “Internet of Everything  IoE ” because of a wide range of real-life applications of IoT. In IoT, there is a network of multiple devices which communicate with each other without direct human intervention. It facilitates quick transfer of data in an efﬁcient manner. The IoT-enabled devices leads to operational improvements in terms of efﬁciency, performance, and safety. The IoT can also be thought of as a one unit global network. The implementation of IoT applications also projects the revenue and growth in the IoT market. The IoT consists of intelligent devices or machines which communicate to other devices, things, machines objects, or infrastructure. Things in IoT referred to objects of physical as well as a virtual world have the capacity to integrate within the communication network.  1.2 History of Blockchain  Underline theme of blockchain is not a new concept. In fact, it has been inspired by the timestamp ordering algorithm of the 90s which was used to prevent tampering of documents. The same thing has been extended for the purpose of ledgers and trans- actions in order to facilitate secure payment mechanisms. Blockchain was invented in a paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto in the year 2008. Since then various pro- grammers, cryptographers, and scientists have worked on this concept of blockchain to produce a cryptocurrency network called the bitcoin. The major design goal and   Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  3  the purpose of the blockchain were to solve two major problems. The ﬁrst is to solve the double spending problem and second was to eliminate the need of central trusted third party.  2 Technical Aspects of Blockchain Technology  The blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain information. Originally, this tech- nique was introduced in 1991 by the group of researchers and was originally meant for digital documents timestamp so it is not possible to backdate the documents or to tamper them. However, it was not in proper use until it was used and adapted by Satoshi Nakamoto in the year 2009 in order to create a digital cryptocurrency bitcoin [1].  2.1 Concept and Working of a Blockchain  The blockchain is a collection of blocks, which is totally open and public to everyone. The open ledger in the blockchain is distributed in nature. The important feature of blockchain is that once the data is recorded into the ledger, then that data can’t be erased. How does the blockchain work? Every block present in the chain consists of the data, hash to that particular data and the previous hash. The data recorded in the blockchain depends on the type of the blockchain. If the blockchain is related to bitcoins, it will store data for transactions, the information about the sender and receiver and the number of bitcoins present in the network. Each block in the chain is having a hash value that can be compared with the ﬁngerprints. As the new block is created, the hash of that particular block will also be generated. The hash of the block will be changed with the modiﬁcations made in the block. Therefore, the hash value is a very important factor while making modiﬁcations in the block. If the hash value of any block will be changed, then it will not be considered to be in the same block. Other than the hash of the current block, the block also holds the hash of the previous block. This helps to make a chain by linking the current block to the previous block. These features of a block in the chain makes blockchain more secure.  Consider an example of a chain having three blocks. As shown in Fig. 1, every block consists of the hash value of the current block and the previous block. In the ﬁgure the block number 2 is pointing toward the block number 1, block number 3 is connected to block number 2 using the previous hash. The previous hash of the ﬁrst block is 0000 because it a special block which is not pointing back to any block. This block is known as the Genesis block. Now suppose somebody wants to tamper block number 2. With the tampering of the block, the hash value of that block will also be changed. In that case, the third block and the following blocks connected in the chain will stand invalid because there is no valid hash present at that moment. Therefore, changing one block in the chain will result in invalidating all the following blocks   4  P. Rathee  Genesis block  1  2  3  Hash: 1P5F  Hash: 2Q6R  Hash: 3D2L  Previous hash: 0000  Previous hash: 1P5F  Previous hash: 2Q6R  Fig. 1 Blockchain structure  in the chain. In order to make it valid, the hacker needs to change the hash value of all the following blocks. Though it a good idea to make the blockchain secure it is not sufﬁcient to stop tampering. With the advancement in computer technologies, hundreds or thousands of hash values can be calculated per second. Anyone can change the hash of the current block and the following hash using the computational technologies. In that case, those blocks will be valid even after tempering. Therefore, in order to make it less serious, the blockchain introduces a concept known as proof of work.  Using the technique of proof of work, the creation of the new block gets slow down up to some extent. In this case of bitcoin, the calculation of proof of work requires nearly 10 min in order to add the new block in the chain. This technique enhanced the security in the blockchain. Because if someone will try to tamper with any block in the chain then he has to recalculate the proof of work for all the following blocks which are quite difﬁcult. Therefore, the collective use of hashing technique and the proof of work mechanism make the blockchain more secure.  One of the major advantages of blockchain is its distributed nature, which makes blockchain secure themselves. Rather than the centralized system of managing the chain, blockchain uses peer-to-peer network. As the blockchain is open and public, anyone can join the network. After joining the network, the participant will be get- ting the complete copy of the chain. The node can verify using that copy whether everything is happening in order or not. Now if somebody creates a new block, then what happens? The block will be sent to everyone present in the network. Each node will verify that block in order to ensure that the block is genuine or tempered. After veriﬁcation, the new block that is created recently and veriﬁed will be added by each node in their copy of the chain. Then an agreement is created by all the nodes in the network. They make a consensus on which block is valid and which is not. If the block is valid, it will be added in the chain. If the block is tempered with, then it will be rejected by all the nodes. Therefore, in order to temper with one block, one has to temper with all the blocks present in the chain, recalculate the has and the proof of work for all the blocks. After doing that, only the tempered block will be accepted by others present in the network, which is nearly impossible to perform. That is why the combination of hash and proof of work is quite a secure mechanism for blockchain [2].  The blockchains are evolving day by day. The smart contracts are the most recent development of the blockchain. The smart contacts are used to transfer coins among   Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  5  the nodes in the network automatically on the basis of some conditions and are recorded in the blockchain. The blockchain technology is creating interest for many users these days. Other than the transfer of bitcoin, this technology can also be used in other sectors as well, like managing medical records, tax collection, digital notary creation, etc.  2.2 Principle of Blockchain Technology  This section will be discussing the principle of blockchain technology. Now let’s see how the problem of money transfer is being addressed by blockchain. The ﬁrst principle related to a blockchain is an open ledger. This concept is explained with the help of an example. Suppose there is a network connected by four people who are interested in transferring money to each other. Suppose A is the genesis node and currently has $10. Let’s focus on the concept of an open ledger and its implementation in blockchain technology. Suppose the person A wants to transfer money to B, let us say he wants to transfer $5 to B. Now what will happen in the blockchain. In the existing blockchain, one more transaction will be added which depicts that A sends $5 to B. After this transaction, now B wants to transfer $3 to D. similarly there will be existing ledger and the new transaction will be clubbed in the existing chain. On the same line, if D wants to transfer $1 to C, the new transaction will be added to the existing chain. That means anyone can add its transaction to the ledger. This concept is known as an open ledger. The chain of the transaction is kept on adding the new blocks, therefore it is known as the blockchain. This chain is open and public to everyone present in the network. That means each and everyone present in the network can trace the movement of money in the network, how much money others are having in their wallet. It can also be decided by everyone in the network whether the transaction is valid or not. For example, at this moment if A wants to transfer $12 to C, then it is not a valid transaction. Because A started with $10 and had already sent $5 to B. Then, in this case, A is left with only $5 in its wallet. So it can’t initiate a transaction of $10. Therefore, it can easily ﬁnd out that this is not a valid transaction. This transaction will not be the part of a chain and will not be clubbed in the open ledger  Fig. 2 .  The distributed ledger is the second principle of the blockchain. One of the major goals of blockchain chain technology is to get rid of the centralized system. Therefore, distributed ledger is another principle of the blockchain. The open ledger will be distributed among all nodes in the network. That means everyone in the network will be having their copy of open ledger. It means there is no need to have a centralized place to store the open ledger as everyone will keep it in their personal space. But again it may arise some problem. All the copies of the ledger present in the network must be synchronized so that all the participants can watch the same version of the open ledger.  The solution of this problem leads to the emergence of the third principle of blockchain, i.e., synchronized ledger. How the nodes in the distributed environment   6  Fig. 2 Open ledger  P. Rathee  B  $3  D  A  C  $5  A=$10  A→B $5  B→D $3  D→C $1  $1  of storing open ledger can be synchronized? Suppose B is willing to transfer $5 to C. Then B will broadcast this intended transaction in the network. Everyone present in the network can immediately notice that B wants to transfer $5 to C. Till now, it is an invalidated transaction. It is not yet approved and will not be added into the open ledger. Here comes the concept of miners. The special node holding the ledger is called miner. Suppose A and D are miners for this case. Following are the functions to be performed by miners. There will be the competition among miners at this moment that who will validate this transaction ﬁrst in order to add it in the open ledger. The miner winning the competition by validating the transaction ﬁrst will be rewarded ﬁnancially in the form of bitcoin. In order to win the competition that means to validate and add the transaction in the open ledger ﬁrst, the miners have to perform two things: initially, the transaction needs to be validated. As the ledger is open and public. Anyone present in the network can immediately calculate whether the initiated transaction is valid or not. The second task the miner has to do is ﬁnding the special key. This key will assist the miner to ﬁnd the previous transaction and to lock the current transaction. The miner has to invest more time and computational power because searching the key is completely random. The miner will do it by hit and trial method by guessing the new keys repeatedly until it will ﬁnd the correct match of the key. The miner ﬁnishing this task ﬁrst will get the ﬁnancial reward.  Now how the distributed ledgers will be synchronized in the network. The miner getting the key ﬁrst will edit the transaction to its own ledger. Say A wins the compe- tition and edits its ledger ﬁrst. Now A will broadcast and publish this modiﬁed ledger to the network. This will save the time of other participants and they will directly append the changes in their ledger. The solution and the key will be published in the network. The other participants can use the key and solution to edit their ledgers.   Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  2.3 Distributed Power  7  The Blockchain is nothing but a group of blocks or a chain of blocks. Each block is going to contain some data and in the context of the blockchain, that data is a ledger or a transaction. Let’s say at time T = 0 is the time when the ﬁrst block was added to the blockchain system and this block which was added at T = 0 is called the Genesis block. Each block of the blockchain also linked to other blocks via linkages to the previous blocks. So in other words, each block of the blockchain has a reference to its previous block. This is how each block of the blockchain is connected to each other. One of the major architectural aspects of blockchain is that blocks are distributed across the P2P network. The P2P is a network wherein each node of the network is connected to every other node of the network. These are the nodes, which also help to store the blocks as well as to do some mining process on the blocks as per the criteria which are mentioned in the blockchain algorithm. This arrangement with which the blocks and the ledgers are distributed across the various nodes of the network is also called as distributed ledger technology or DLT. The DLT is also abbreviated as an alternative name of blockchain in order to make it more generic.  2.4 Security  The blockchain is one of the most fundamental technologies underpinning. One area where the number of people getting excited to use blockchain is identity. Identity is a very important concept at the basis of any security puzzle because if you know who you are talking to, where they are coming from, then you can trust them. Blockchain with its replicated storage and its decentralized management offers some exciting possibilities for storing and providing access to identities which can then be used in bigger transactions [3].  2.5 Transparency  One of the core philosophies of blockchain is transparency or visibility. So there is open ledger for all to see what happened. Deterrence is a useful way of stopping bad things from happening. If people know that the record of what they are doing is going to be laid bare to be checked later to be veriﬁed, they often just won’t do the bad things in the ﬁrst place. It is not worth if the risk of getting caught is too high. So in principle, this openness and transparency is a great way of taking out some of the security problems and some requirements from technology from blockchain-based systems.   8  2.6 Privacy  P. Rathee  Not everything should be laid open for everybody to see. The details of a transaction may be private between the people who did it for very good reason. So getting the balance of openness and transparency with other reasonable expectations of privacy and secrecy is trick one.  2.7 Smart Contract  Another core technology associated with blockchain is called smart contract. These are little pieces of code that can execute automatically without any interference from external systems. These are basically set up and if something happens in the future then the other thing should happen as a consequence. For example, if I sell something at a certain price, the money should automatically move and I don’t need to get in the way of that. In terms of insurance if an event happens which triggers my insurance automatically get paid.  3 Blockchain and IoT Implications  3.1 Economic Implication  Blockchain technology has relevance for all areas but because of its nature as a secure value exchange protocol, the most readily identiﬁable ones are within ﬁnance, busi- ness, and economy. As with other areas, the blockchain has the capacity to decen- tralize economic activity creating a distributed peer-to-peer networks of exchange. It greatly expands the scope and extent of economic markets and ﬁnances within the ongoing developments of economic globalization were in the process of massive scaling up of the global economy of exchange. The blockchain has many applications for enabling the global economy of exchange including its capacity to establish prop- erty rights where previously there were none in enabling supply chain provenance in business collaborations in the industry. The components in enabling economic exchange are  1. Property rights: The ﬁrst component in enabling economic exchange in develop- ments is the capacity to deﬁne and enforce property rights. Traditional top-down attempts have been costly to implement on large scale and have been unsuccess- ful at increasing global property rights. A bottom-up approach instead follows a process wherein claims are made by individuals veriﬁed by those affected aggre- gated by the community and then brought to the legal authority. The blockchain   Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  9  user monitored digital registry is a kind of tool that allows communities to serve themselves in the face of unresponsive governments.  2. Supply chains: These are one of the primary areas of blockchain which has found application and is largely due to the fact that they involve many different organi- zations. Here it works to improve collaborations by creating a single database and source of truth. It can reduce fraud and corruption, automate a manual process, and control for issues of authentication. With blockchain technology, one can get a much more granular view of the complete supply chain. The things can be recorded like all of the manufacturing data for an aircraft assembly where all of the elements or the subsystems have been in its journey from the original man- ufacturer all the way through to integration into the ﬁnal aircraft. The hashing and time stamping capacity of the blockchain means we can record exactly who does what with asset over the life cycle with all the parties having access to and being able to trust this data. Currently, the supply chain for many organizations is very complex in pack given the fact that they have many tiers to them with many different parties involved. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the issue that where it came from when something went wrong. With the blockchain registry, this information can be known almost immediately. Therefore, the whole supply chain management becomes much more effective and transparent using blockchain.  3. Finance: The application of blockchain technology to ﬁnance are many. A new model of venture capital in the form of initial coin offerings to prediction markets. By adding a layer of automated trust and building market platforms, blockchain technology offers the real possibility.  3.2 Technological Implications  While moving into the world of connectivity and networks, a new technology paradigm is emerging. It is called the internet of things. The technology paradigm of the industrial age was one of the machines, standalone mechanized systems. They were physical in nature, monofunctional, and mechanized. It is a world where indi- vidual component technologies are instrumented and connected into large networks devices that can communicate peer–peer, adapt, and self-organized around the end users needs. So as to deliver a seamless service, the best illustration of this is a smart city where different systems no longer exist in silos but are interconnected and organized around end users needs through information networks. The internet of things is a journey that we are just beginning on over the course of the next decades. Billions of devices will come online. The amount of data the internet has to han- dle will grow massively as a vast network of devices and machines continuously communicate with each other to coordinate production processes for transport and logistics for construction, climate control, etc. This requires an IT infrastructure that goes far beyond the existing capacities of the internet in terms of dealing with the massive amount of secure data, secure communication transactions and automated micro exchanges of value. The role of blockchain is already discussed above in these   10  P. Rathee  areas. The combination of IoT and blockchain seems to be a very efﬁcient technology in every ﬁeld. Blockchain networks could provide a robust and decentralized system for handling these issues on the micro level of individual devices and machines. The internet of things going to need micropayments systems where devices can pay automatically on demand based on the resources they consumed [4].  3.3 Social Implication of Blockchain and IoT  There are various social implications of blockchain and IoT. Some of them are illustrated as follows:  Personal responsibility: It puts the responsibility of an individual solely in their hands. You can no longer ofﬂoad responsibility if you live in a completely open environment. If you lose your private key, your money is gone. Spreading of value distribution: One is also spreading the value of distribution if one takes note of a few hacks in exchange. The system can’t be broken. The whole things can’t be taken down by taking a single part of it. Only can be done is the value distribution existing in the network. All of the data or value is held at the end nodes. Service in transit: People who try to build on top of the network focus on actually providing service through transit. The money is transmitting, and never held by one node. The data is transformed and moved it somewhere else. Large-scale agreement of information: As opposed to the client–server model, data on one application may doesn’t correspond to the same redundant data on another application. So when you have things like a consortium of banks, you have to have a lot of middlemen which have to keep track of a lot of auditing. The blockchain solves this problem in order to make the payment and money transfer system by making it completely automated. As the blockchain technology is decentralized, so the problem of the middleman is also got solve by using blockchain. And apart from it, the IoT provides the interconnection of all the devices and blockchain provides the decentralized property. Therefore, the combination of two makes it convenient for the agreement of information on a large scale.  4 Blockchain Use Cases for IoT  4.1 Healthcare Industry  This section will illustrate how emerging technologies can be leveraged by the health- care industry to capture, manage, and analyze patient details. The data sent by the patient is recorded and presented to the doctors through IoT application. The doctor can record the patient’s medical history and store it in a blockchain. Thereby pro- viding immutability to the patient’s medical record. In the end states, doctors will   Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  11  be able to share patient’s record with other doctors with explicit authorization from the patient. The patient can be charged for storing and sharing medical records. This could lead to the creation of a thriving e-commerce platform. The application and all its components are hosted on the cloud. One cloud is IBM blue-mix cloud. There are several other clouds also available. Anyone of them can be used.  4.2 Public Safety—Secure Communication for Critical  Incidences  This section will be explaining the public-key infrastructure  PKI  for IoT. What is the role of PKI in IoT? PKI serves to support building and maintaining trust in the IoT ecosystem. Aligning with traditional information security principles, the ﬁrst role we are looking for PKI is authentication, authenticating devices to the cloud services between users and devices and from things to things. It is also an open standard for interoperability. Privacy is the major concern for all the devices and applications available online. Encrypting communications to and from these devices is essential. Applying PKI affords some basic and essential mechanisms ensuring the privacy of communications using encryption. The integrity of data is a very important factor to be considered during communication. With the introduction of IoT, the devices got automated and capable of taking decisions without the interference of human. In such situations, both the risk and the value are related directly to the integrity of data. The example of PKI implementation is cellular signal ampliﬁer devices— spider cloud wireless. Spider cloud node sits within a warehouse or ofﬁce building to build a system that extends mobile coverage. During manufacturing, publicly trusted certiﬁcates are embedded into a trusted platform module which enables a secure boot process, mutual authentication, and encrypted communication with the spider cloud appliances. They accomplish this leverage in Globalsign’s M SSL platform and APIs to provision certiﬁcates during manufacturing and also during the system life cycle to reissue and renew the certiﬁcates. The next example is networking appliances— Nepara. Back in 2008, they became the ﬁrst company to use a fully vetted X.509 digital certiﬁcate for networking gear which they managed over HTTPs. They choose to use PKI to solve their problems of identifying the device and encrypting the connection. To implement this, each appliance has its own unique fully qualiﬁed domain name. They use the API to import CERT on each device. It was important to include the certiﬁcates with each appliance so that the end user organization wouldn’t have to obtain a certiﬁcate themselves or use a self-signed certiﬁcate. They also choose to use publically trusted certiﬁcates so as administrators would be shown trust indicators when accessing the devices with browsers rather than the self-signed certiﬁcates, which they have to use for beta deployments.   12  P. Rathee  Home owner  Renter  Access management and security  Lighting and temperature control  Rent “add-on” rooms &devices  Fig. 3 DApp functionalities  4.3 Smart Homes  This use case study will discuss how homeowners can control and share their smart homes. Today, platforms like Airbnb own our personal data and have high fees while public listing less trust and security. NKN and IoTeX blockchain technology addresses these issues and offers a new decentralized alternative to short-term home rentals. They integrate lightweight IoT devices to the blockchain-smart locks, ther- mostats, and lights. They developed a DApp running on NKN’s peer-to-peer network and IoTeX’s smart contract platform. It lets the user control and authorizes access to their smart homes in fully P2P fashion. It is the ﬁrst step towards the “Airbnb of the future”. Homeowners can securely authorize access to their smart homes. Authorize guests can seamlessly control lights, thermostats, and other connected devices. They can even unlock add-on rooms or equipment closets in real time through a conve- nient mobile application. With blockchain, homeowners can enjoy full control of their smart homes and data while offering renters the same convenience and a cus- tom rental experience. To bring it to a full circle, access can be securely shared with multiple people, and all terms between parties are enforced by smart contracts. The collaboration shows the possibilities of blockchain and IoT technologies  Fig. 3 .  4.4 Supply Chain Management—Smart Supply Contracts  In this section, the impact of smart contacts on the supply chain will be elaborated. Let’s imagine you decide to purchase a new computer. However, in this case, let’s imagine you are also concerned about the working conditions in the factory where the computer was assembled. You may have a concern about the quality of a speciﬁc component inside the computer. Right now, there is no easy way to check from where your computer came and how it got made. The complex web of relationships that provide the materials, manufacture the components, assemble the parts, and deliver the computer to market is known as the supply chain. Hundreds of years ago sup- ply chains were fairly simple. Miners and farmers provided natural resources to a skilled craftsman like blacksmiths and tailors who then created and sold ﬁnished products. Today’s supply chains are much more complicated, fragmented, and dif- ﬁcult to understand. Hundreds or even thousands of suppliers all around the world contribute to make and ship the computer you purchased. Most of the time various   Introduction to Blockchain and IoT  13  companies don’t know about each other. As a consumer, you don’t know anything about how, where, when, what, under what conditions your computer was made. This is not just a problem for consumers. Today’s supply chain is so complex that even Apple, Dell, or HP has difﬁculty in tracking that how their computers get made.  Smart contracts could make supply chain management simpler and more trans- parent. The idea is to create a single source of information about products in a supply chain in a global ledger. Each component would have its own entry on the blockchain that gets tracked over time. Both companies could then update the status of a com- ponent in real time. The end result is once you receive your computer, you could track every component back to its manufacturer. Theoretically, you could trace the supply chain all the way back to the mines where the raw materials came from. Companies can also use the blockchain supply chain as a single source of truth for their products. They can manage and monitor risks within the supply chain ensuring the quality of delivered parts and track delivery status. Additionally, companies can use smart contracts to manage and pay for supply chains autonomously. For exam- ple, a chip manufacturer could be paid immediately upon testing of each individual chip at the assembly facility. This would reduce the need for large contracts invoices and the back-and-forth of refund requests for faulty components. Those same smart contracts could assist with shipping and logistics, tracking valuable products as they travel around the world. Using blockchain companies can ﬁnally have a complete picture of their products at every stage in the supply chain bringing transparency to the production process while reducing the cost of manufactured goods.  5 Key Challenges for Block Chain and IoT  5.1 Operational  The IoT and blockchain technologies are connecting several devices working on sev- eral platforms. The devices communicating with each other might face the problem of compatibility with each other. In order to make these technologies operational efﬁciently, we need a common platform for all the devices and inbuilt technologies [5].  5.2 Technical  The major technical issues of blockchain and IoT technology are scalability, security, and storage requirement. The issue of security has already been discussed in detail. So coming to the issue of scalability which means that the capacity to process a transaction on the blockchain is limited. In the case of ﬁnancial transactions, there happens several thousands of transaction per second. This means that in blockchain   14  P. Rathee  we have some constraints of security, scalability, and storage capacity. Thought the researchers are working on these issues and improving day by day.  5.3 Legal and Compliance Issue  Though it is very excited to have new technology on board, the internet lacks the ability to currently connect back to the real world in the way that machine-to-machine world as presented by the internet of things. Internet of things is not just the internet of things, it is the internet of behavior, and internet of life. What are some ethical concerns that people are thinking about are quality control and accountability? Ulti- mately, one wants to know where who do we go to when someone breached a legal parameter and it is getting quite difﬁcult. Another issue is the repository of informa- tion that will be created. What will be the criteria of identity when we as a lawyer think about how to protect personal data. This is a legal and ethical concern how to put that in a framework and monitor and govern that.  6 Conclusion  In this chapter, we discussed the concept of blockchain, how does blockchain works? The various technical aspects of blockchain were described including the principles of blockchain, distributive power, security, privacy, and smart contracts. After that, the implications of blockchain and IoT in terms of economic, technological, social and political were elaborated. Initially, blockchain was used for transferring bitcoins but later it was applied to various other sectors like medical records management, tax collection, etc. So some of the use cases of this technology are also given in the chapter. As the new technology is emerging so there will be various issues related to technology. So, the key challenges to the blockchain and IoT technology are explained in the chapter.  References  1.

Therefore, we need to know some information about the implementation of them. For this purpose, many tools and applications have been reported in the literature. In this chapter, we show how an application can be implemented using blockchain, AI, and IoT. In addition, we will introduce an approach for designing this type of applications using object-oriented techniques. At ﬁrst, we summarize popular implementation technologies. Then, an implementation perspective based on object- oriented concepts for cognitive IoT based on blockchain is given. Finally, two case studies are analyzed.  Keywords Blockchain technology· Artiﬁcial intelligence· Internet of Things  1 Introduction  Blockchain technology, Artiﬁcial Intelligence  AI , and the Internet of Things  IoT  will lead to a revolution in modern countries. The Internet is currently being managed by humans, who can use it to communicate with each other. However, this pattern is changing, as new types of devices are starting to use the Internet. These devices are not managed by humans, rather they communicate with each other and things are identiﬁed as main elements—this is known as the IoT. Samsung recently reported A. M.

Fig. 1 Number of connected devices [2]  that, by 2020, 100% of its products will be available on the Internet [1]. Figure 1 shows that the number of connected devices has surpassed the human population and continues to rise.  In this chapter, we focus on the implementation perspective in three ﬁelds: blockchain technology, AI, and the IoT. The rest of the chapter is organized as fol- lows. Section 2 discusses the implementation perspective of blockchain platforms. In Sects. 3 and 4, some important IoT and AI platforms for implementation are studied. A hybrid system based on IoT, AI, and Blockchain is explained in Sect. 5. Finally, the conclusions and future work are given in Sect. 6.  2 Blockchain Implementation Perspective  Blockchain technology can be used to design a decentralized system for tracking, doc- umenting, and facilitating transactions. In this section, we study the most important platforms for implementing the blockchain. There are many solutions for blockchain- based applications in the literature. In this section, we survey eight well-known solu- tions.  2.1 Bitcoin  Bitcoin, which was ﬁrst registered in 2008, refers to a collection of concepts and technologies which establishes the basis for a digital money ecosystem [3]. Bitcoin users communicate with each other by utilizing a special form of peer-to-peer pro- tocol primarily via the Internet. The Bitcoin protocol stack, which is available as   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  17  n i a h c k c o l B n e p O e h t  g n i m m a r g o r P n i o c t i  B g n i r e t s a  M  e c r u o S  . ] 4 [  w e i v r e v o n i o c t i  B  2  .  g i F   18  A. M. Saghiri et al.  open-source software, can be used on a wide range of computing devices such as laptops and smartphones, which can lead to easier and greater Bitcoin accessibility. Some well-known features of Bitcoin are given as follows [4]:  cid:129  A decentralized peer-to-peer network  the Bitcoin protocol ,  cid:129  A public transaction ledger  the blockchain ,  cid:129  A set of rules used for validating independent transaction validation and issuing the currency  consensus rules , and  cid:129  A mechanism for obtaining a global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain  proof-of-work algorithm .  In order to develop an application based on Bitcoin, some of the best libraries and  programming languages are mentioned in [4]  Fig. 2 .  2.2 Ethereum  Ethereum is considered to be a trusted computational platform, along with a native currency, which is established on top of a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Any digital content which can be controlled by someone may be saved in an Ethereum smart contract, which is then transferred between peers without requiring a third party or middleman, such as a bank, exchange, or central government [5]. The data stored in smart contracts are safe and easy to access, although the cost and structure of the store are more related to metadata-related applications because saving real data is too expensive. Figure 3 presents an architecture for the entire Ethereum ecosystem on a network. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is mostly utilized for directing smart contracts, as well as establishing a consensus among all participants [6].  cid:129  Whisper: Ethereum has its own messaging protocol called Whisper. Whisper is a decentralized chat mechanism on the Ethereum platform which operates on a peer-to-peer protocol.  In the Ethereum ecosystem, the following play important roles:  Fig. 3 Ethereum ecosystem [6]   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  19   cid:129  Ethereum Virtual Machine  EVM : Ethereum includes a Virtual Machine  VM  called the EVM [5] for consensus-based virtual machine decoding of the compiled contracts in bytecodes, which are performed by Ethereum network peers.  cid:129  Smart contracts: These contracts are considered as self-executing contracts which are between two entities [6]. Smart contracts can be written in Solidity, Low-level Lisp  LLL , or Serpent and Vyper [5, 6].  cid:129  IPFS: This is a protocol and network designed to create a peer-to-peer method for saving and sharing data [6].  cid:129  Gas: Gas is the fuel which controls an Ethereum network. The transaction creator determines a special amount of gas for the transaction. Gas is used to encourage more and more miners to focus on validating transactions in a public Ethereum blockchain network.  2.3 Stellar  This platform connects banks, payments systems, and people in order to allow for money to be transferred quickly, reliably, and almost low cost [7]. Figure 4 presents an overview of the Stellar network. Most applications can interact with the Stellar network through a RESTful HTTP API server, which provides us with a clear method for submitting transactions, checking accounts, and subscribing to events. Stellar maintains Software Development Kit  SDKs , based on JavaScript [8], Java [9], and Go [10], which are used for communicating with Horizon. In addition, there are community-maintained SDKs for Ruby [11], Python [12], and C [13]. In the Stellar network, there is a core which is responsible for validating and accommodating other examples of Cores during every transaction via the Stellar Consensus Protocol  SCP  [14]. Furthermore, Stellar can be utilized to build sophisticated smart contracts, which are expressed as a collection of transactions connected and performed by implementing different constraints [7].  2.4 Hyperledger  Hyperledger is an open-source collaborative effort made for developing cross- industry blockchain technologies. This project is designated as a global collaboration involving leaders in banking, ﬁnance, the IoT, manufacturing, supply chains, and technology [15]  Fig. 5 .  Hyperledger produces and improves a set of business blockchain technologies, such as distributed ledger frameworks, smart contract engines, client libraries, graph- ical interfaces, utility libraries, and sample applications [15]. Some of the versions of Hyperledger are discussed in Table 1.   20  A. M.

As illustrated in Fig. 6, its Blockchain Cloud Service  BCS  is regarded as an enterprise-grade, distributed ledger platform, which is designed to support new DLT applications and extend ERP, supply chain management  SCM , and other enterprise Software-as-a-Service  SaaS  and on-premise applications by enabling enterprises to conduct business-to-business transactions securely and at scale across a trusted network with tamper-proof digital records.  In this system, service providers can create blockchain ledgers and networks by supplying one or more instances of the BCS quickly. This is done by involving the entire necessary infrastructure created from the box for implementing the BCS. The Oracle solution has been referred to as a Platform-as-a-Service  PaaS , which is offered in the Oracle Public Cloud, as well as regarded as an on-premise application via the Oracle Cloud Machine, as a part of the Oracle Cloud’s customer offering [20].  2.6 Microsoft Azure  The Microsoft company has produced a solution for blockchain-based applications known as Azure. The Azure Blockchain Workbench is part of the collection of Azure services. These services are designed to help with producing and implement- ing blockchain applications. The Blockchain Workbench plays a signiﬁcant role in   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  23  Fig. 6 Oracle’s blockchain platform [19]  creating blockchain applications by combining several Azure services and capabil- ities to help automate common development tasks. In addition, it can be used by creating a solution template in Azure Marketplace. The template allows users to collect the modules and components to deploy with the Blockchain Workbench [21]  Fig. 7 .  2.7 Amazon Blockchain  Amazon Web Services   The Amazon company offers a solution for blockchain-based applications by uti- lizing a wide range of Web services. The Amazon Managed Blockchain is regarded as a fully managed service which paves the way for creating and managing scalable blockchain networks by utilizing popular open-source frameworks including Hyper- ledger Fabric and Ethereum. Therefore, the overheads needed for establishing the network is eliminated [22]. Amazon Web Services  AWS  represent the simplest way to establish scalable blockchain networks and ledger applications, alongside provid- ing a ledger database. This database has high performance, which is immutable and cryptographically veriﬁable, by removing the need for establishing complex audit tables or setting up blockchain networks. The Amazon Quantum Ledger Database  QLDB  refers to a new class of database, which satisﬁes the need to engage in the   24  A. M.

In this database, the data cannot be altered or deleted [23]  Figs. 8 and 9 .  2.8 IBM Blockchain  The IBM company has also proposed a platform for blockchain-based applications utilizing Web services. Figure 10 presents the structure of this platform. The IBM Blockchain Platform has inﬂuenced Hyperledger Fabric to create a new kind of dis- tributed business network, found on the principles related to ﬁnality, trust, and privacy [24]. The IBM Blockchain Platform is built on top of key open-source instruments in order to create the necessary infrastructure for developing, operating, and governing enterprise solutions. In addition, IBM is regarded as the only business-ready end- to-end platform which empowers institutions to trigger a decentralized blockchain network in the recorded time [24].  3 IoT Implementation Perspectives  The IoT facilitates smart interaction between people and objects around the Inter- net as the backbone of the communication system [25]. IoT platforms provide the infrastructure for managing things [26]. There are many platforms reported in the literature. In this section, we survey six well-known platforms.  3.1 Oracle  Using the Oracle IoT Cloud Service, we can create innovative services. According to [27], some features of this service are listed below:   26  A. M.

There are many tools and applications reported in the literature for utilizing AI in the IoT. In this section, we discuss four well-known platforms.  4.1 Oracle AI  Oracle makes it easy for designing novel applications based on AI and ML.

Most of the solutions are available as part of Google’s cloud services. These services are simple, scalable, and easy to use. Google offers three AI cloud packages as follows [40]:  cid:129  AI building blocks: These allow developers to easily infuse AI into applications. There are two types of building blocks: APIs for pretrained models and AutoML for custom models. These building blocks can be used individually or in combination [41].  cid:129  AI solutions: Google’s AI solutions are fast and also easy to apply. Note that obtaining a custom solution can be time-consuming, complex, and costly. The solutions can be summarized as follows: Cloud Talent Solution  for job search- ing , Contact Center AI  for managing customers , Recommendation Engine  for recommending appropriate content on media websites , and ML APIs [42].  cid:129  AI platform: Several services and tools used by data scientists, such as big data and ML, are available on Google’s AI platform.  Table 4 summarizes the tools and products of Google AI Cloud [43].  5 Implementation Perspectives for Hybrid Systems Based  on the IoT, AI, and Blockchain  In this part, we ﬁrst propose a general framework for designing a hybrid system based on the IoT, AI, and blockchain. Then, the means to implement the proposed frame- work is suggested involving the use of an object-oriented approach. Finally, a case study of the suggested implementation is given for car insurance. It should be noted that this section is organized based on [44–47]. Figure 21 presents a combination of the IoT, AI, and blockchain.

The structure of the proposed framework is given in Fig. 22. This frame- work consists of three layers: requirement layer, cognitive process layer, and things management layer. In the thing’s management layer of this framework, the elements of the IoT are combined with blockchain technology. It should be highlighted that the combination of the IoT and blockchain technology creates many management problems, which should be resolved by cognitive systems. It is obvious that distributed, dynamic, and large-scale characteristics of a system obtained from a combination of the IoT and blockchain technology can also lead to difﬁcult management problems, which cannot be resolved by manual or non-smart solutions. In the proposed framework, the cognitive process layer is in charge of managing the system by resolving the management problems associated with the things management layer. The details of each layer are given in the rest of this section.   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  41  Cognitive Specification Language  Requirement Layer  Goal  Cognitive Engine  Cognitive Process Layer  Observe  Act  Blockchain based IoT system  Things Management Layer  Fig. 22 A framework of a cognitive IoT for blockchain [46]  It should be noted that we have borrowed some concepts from the framework of cognitive networks introduced by [45, 48].  5.1.1 Requirement Layer  In the requirement layer, the goal and behavior of the network may be described by a Cognitive Speciﬁcation Language  CSL . This language is used to ﬁll a ﬁle called a conﬁguration ﬁle. This ﬁle is shared among those entities which manage the conﬁgurations of the IoT. It should be understood that changing the goals in the requirements layer can lead to changes in the optimizing functions of the cognitive process layer. The goals of the systems are determined by certain commands obtained from the voice  or speech , a command line, or any type of direct interaction between users and the system. Some features of the goals which can be achieved by the following elements:  cid:129  Service type,  cid:129  Payment type,  cid:129  Smart contract type,  cid:129  Sensor type, and  cid:129  Actuators type.  The above elements can be used in commands. These commands can be also used to tune the conﬁguration of the system and can be fetched from outside of the framework. Several approaches for sharing the conﬁguration ﬁle, which take into account the distributed nature of the IoT, are suggested below:   42  A. M. Saghiri et al.   cid:129  Centralized algorithm: In this algorithm, the last version of the conﬁguration ﬁle is stored in one well-known server.  cid:129  Semi-centralized algorithm: In this algorithm, multiple servers are in charge of managing the conﬁguration ﬁle in the IoT.  cid:129  Fully distributed algorithm: In this algorithm, each thing periodically downloads the last version of the conﬁguration ﬁle from its neighboring things.  We should point out that blockchain technology can be also used to manage the  conﬁguration ﬁle with high security.  5.1.2 Things Management Layer  This layer contains four units as described below:  This layer provides the required information for the cognitive process layer and then operates on manageable elements of the systems. Figure 23 presents the structure of this layer. A more detailed explanation of each unit is given in the rest of this section.  cid:129  Blockchain unit: This unit is in charge of managing the required information in one or multiple blockchains. In this unit, every type of blockchain  such as in health care [49], insurance [50], and banking [51]  may be used. This unit has three sub-units: blockchain of things, blockchain of microservices, and blockchain of smart contracts. For example, the information on the microservices used by the system is indexed in the blockchain of microservices and the information on the smart contracts used by the system is indexed in the blockchain of smart contracts. This unit can be extended by a blockchain for ontologies used by the system [48].  cid:129  Peer-to-peer communication unit: This element facilitates the communication and data exchange among things using peer-to-peer networking technology. This element also deals with the management issues related to the blockchain of things.  cid:129  Smart contract unit: This element provides the required functions for using the smart contracts deﬁned in the system. It should be noted that the codes of smart contracts are stored by the blockchain unit in a blockchain [52]. The cognitive engine is in charge of tuning and using the smart contract unit in order to achieve the goal of the system. It is important to understand that smart contracts are able to operate on actuators of the system.  cid:129  Payment unit: This unit supports the payment process in cooperation with the cognitive process layer and other units of the things management layer in the  Blockchain based IoT system  Blockchain Unit  Peer-to-Peer   Communication Unit  Smart Contract Unit  Payment Unit  Fig. 23 Things management layer [47, 48]   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  43  Table 5 Cryptocurrencies used in the IoT [47, 48] Coin  Goal  Bitcoin Ethereum Ripple Stellar IoTA  MONERO ICON  Golem  Dentcoin  A well-known cryptocurrency.

This unit also manages the information about the wallets of the users and things. A thing may be equipped with a wallet. It should be noted that the types of cryptocurrencies  coins  of the users should be managed in this unit. In other words, the payment manager unit must be able to communicate with the platform for every type of coin. According to Table 5, each coin has been deﬁned on a platform, and each platform has been designed for an issue. Coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IoTA have been used in the IoT [53–56].  5.1.3 Cognitive Process Layer  In this layer, the cognitive engine observes information about the system and then executes appropriate algorithms for managing the system. This layer considers the goals of the system which are speciﬁed in the requirement layer. In this layer, several types of engines may be designated, which are described below:  cid:129  An engine for ﬁnding the goals of the system by interpreting the conﬁguration ﬁle. In this engine, machine translation algorithms may be applied to extract the goals. Watson [57] can be used in this unit.  cid:129  An engine for managing the complexities related to smart contracts. Many smart contracts can be implemented in the system and the cognitive engine should be able to manage them.  cid:129  An engine for managing the complexities related to payment processes.  cid:129  An engine for managing the knowledge  or ontologies  and memory used by the management algorithms.  cid:129  An engine for managing peer-to-peer communication and blockchain.  cid:129  An engine for intrusion detection.   44  A. M. Saghiri et al.  In all of above types, information about the things is shared among the engines. Given the distributed nature of the IoT, the cognitive engine can be implemented using one of the following methods:  cid:129  Centralized approach: In this approach, the cognitive engine is implemented in one server.  cid:129  Semi-centralized approach: In this approach, the engines of the cognitive engine are implemented in multiple servers.  cid:129  Fully distributed approach: In this approach, each thing has its own cognitive engine.  The detailed descriptions about the proposed framework are given in [47, 48].  5.2 Framework Implementation: An Object-Oriented  Approach  The proposed framework is not dependent on any speciﬁc form of implementation. In this section, an implementation approach based on object-oriented design is given. For the implementation of each layer of the proposed framework, a class is designed. Details on these classes are given in the next three subsections  Fig. 24 .  5.2.1 Requirement Analyzer  This class is in charge of implementing the functionality of the requirement layer. This class has two main methods, as described below:  cid:129  Noise remover: This method removes the noise  any inappropriate information  found during interaction with the user.  cid:129  Goal injector: This method, at ﬁrst, takes an input from a user and then uses appropriate methods for cleaning it before ﬁnally sending it and the conﬁguration ﬁle to an appropriate cognitive engine in the cognitive process layer.

The three most important of these classes are  Fig. 25  as follows:  cid:129  Speech-based requirement analyzer: This class focuses on voice-based interaction with the user.  cid:129  Visual-based requirement analyzer: This class focuses on the interaction with the user using visual interaction.  cid:129  Text-based requirement analyzer: This class focuses on the text-based interaction with the user.  5.2.2 Cognitive Engine  This class is in charge of implementing the functionality of the cognitive process layer. This class has three main methods, as described below:  cid:129  Orchestrator: This method takes the set of goals from the requirement layer and then adaptively manages the things management layer. The cognitive processes of the cognitive process layer are managed by the orchestrator method based on an ongoing process.  cid:129  Observe: This method takes an identiﬁer as input and then returns the value s  corresponding to that identiﬁer. For example, the identiﬁer can be the name of a sensor or the name of a smart contract.  cid:129  Act: This method takes an identiﬁer as input and then activates the actuator s  corresponding to that identiﬁer.  Many classes inherit this class. Eleven of the most important of these classes are   Fig. 26  as follows:   46  A. M. Saghiri et al.

This class has three main methods, as described below:  cid:129  Activate: This method is used to activate  or deactivate  a thing.  cid:129  Get: This method is used to get information from a thing.  cid:129  Set: This method is used to set a value  or command  for a thing.

The ﬁve most important of these classes are  Fig. 27  as follows:  cid:129  Thing broker: This class takes the requests from the cognitive process layer and cooperates with other objects of the things management layer to execute appro- priate functions.  cid:129  Blockchain things: This class is designated to manipulate things in the blockchain unit.  cid:129  Peer-to-peer things: This class is designated to manipulate things in peer-to-peer communication.  cid:129  Smart contract things: This class is designated to manipulate things in smart con- tracts.  cid:129  Payment things: This class is designated to manipulate things in the payment unit.  5.3 Framework Implementation  In this section, a cognitive recommender system is designated, based on the proposed framework for a shopping center.  5.3.1 A Case Study for Recommender System  The use case and sequence diagrams are also employed to explain the functionality of a recommender system. The commands obtained from the user should be considered by the system, as described below:  cid:129  Recommend items to the user by considering the history of purchases.  cid:129  Consider the healthcare proﬁle of the user for computing the discount factor.  cid:129  Use the Bitcoin wallet for the payment process.   48  A. M. Saghiri et al.  user  recommend a set of items   >   >   >  gather information of products  gather information of users  gather information of smart   contracts  Fig. 28 Use case diagram for the recommender system  The above commands are taken by an object whose class is that of the requirement analyzer. This object sends the commands to the cognitive engine. The use case of the proposed algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 28 and the corresponding sequence diagram is given in Fig. 29.  In the proposed algorithm, when the user enters the shopping center, his informa- tion is sensed by the sensors and saved in the blockchain. After the user’s commands have been received, the cognitive engine and the corresponding services are called to interpret the commands in order to draw out the goals of the system for the user. According to the goals which have been extracted, the smart contract can be fetched, then the corresponding recommendation services can be called. After that, appropri- ate items can be recommended to the customer by the system. The user purchases the products, after which the discount is calculated, based on smart contracts. Finally, the user completes the payment process using his Bitcoin wallet, which in turn changes the account’s value. It should be noted that, according to the goals determined by the user, the smart contracts are based on his medical information and purchase history.  5.3.2 A Case Study from Car Insurance  The author of [49] presented a case study for smart vehicle insurance based on blockchain, cognitive systems, and the IoT. In this case study, both the driver and the vehicle have an ID. These forms of ID and related information are saved in the system. In the requirement layer, the goal of the vehicle insurance is determined by the insurance packet selected for the driver. The goal can be set automatically by the system or manually by the driver. The system’s goal is used by the cognitive engine in the cognitive process layer. The variety of vehicle information and driver behavior is obtained by the IoT sensors in the third layer. This information is as follows:  cid:129  Driving at night,  cid:129  Driving on busy roads,   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  49   : user  : user   : Requirement   : Requirement   Analyser Analyser  1. commands   : Cognitive   : Cognitive   Engine Engine   : Things   : Things  Manipulator Manipulator  2. command cleaning  3. commands  10. select items  9. recomendation list  11. activate payment  4. goal extraction  5. get information  6. set information  7. compute recommendations  8. set recommendations  12. get information  13. set information  14. execute payemt  15. set information  16. set screen for the user things  Fig. 29 Sequence diagram for the recommender system   cid:129  Driving on high-risk roads,  cid:129  Driving more hours on a day that has more trafﬁc,  cid:129  Weather conditions,  cid:129  Drowsiness of the driver, and  cid:129  A diagnostic test driver who uses drugs and alcohol.  This information has been stored in the cognitive engine. In our case, the cognitive engine with the ML algorithm analyzes the metrics and selects the insurance package for driver. This system, using RESTful Web Services, can obtain certain information about the vehicle’s history from other insurance companies, as well as any records   50  A. M. Saghiri et al.  relating to driver behavior from the police department. This information is then analyzed in the cognitive engine. In this system, insurance companies, the police department, and the driver’s behavior are involved in a consensus process which, in more than 51% of cases, determines a smart contract. The smart contract is provided to the driver and registered in the ledger.  5.3.3  Implementation Details  To implement this case study, we considered the following high-level architecture based on IBM Bluemix-based Hyperledger services [58]. In this system, the IBM Watson platform acted as the cognitive engine in our case study.  According to Fig. 30, the Bluemix blockchain can be implemented along with  Hyperledger Fabric as follows.  In the blockchain, before any transactions are registered in the ledger, the con- sensus process takes place. In addition, using the MQTT Protocol, the Watson IoT platform obtains data from the sensors. These data are sent as a chain code based on various conﬁgurations. Finally, a smart transaction based on chain code technology is executed on IBM Bluemix. The Watson IoT platform also obtains data from the sensors and monitors the vehicle sensors during driving. In this scenario, two types of sensors are used. Onboard sensors obtain various data for analyzing driving behavior patterns, such as speed, location, and direction. V2 V and V2I sensors obtain data from other vehicles and transfer them to the Watson IoT platform. At this point, the  Fig. 30 Blockchain IoT application architecture as reported in [58]   The Internet of Things, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Blockchain…  51  Watson IoT platform  cognitive engine  analyzes the data to determine the driving pattern, which is passed on as output to the IBM blockchain service to undertake various actions. Based on this analysis, a smart contract is generated. The chain code smart contract is designed, based on Hyperledger Fabric and Node.js, and integrated with the Watson IoT platform. For executing the chain code smart contract, Node.js provides stakeholders  driver, police department, insurance companies, government authorities, etc.  with access to the data stored in the IBM blockchain [59].  In this scenario, the Node-RED orchestration in Bluemix can be used to orga- nize the IoT events and post these events after the boost; this is known as a driving pattern analysis service. The driver behavior analysis in Watson IoT Driver Behav- ior analyzes any driver and vehicle data based on IoT events from the Node-RED orchestration. Figure 31 illustrates how the component interacts to implement driver behavior and analysis information [59].  The main process in this scenario is described below:  1. The vehicle owner is registered in the systems using the client application, after  which an asset is created in the blockchain platform.  2. The vehicle sensors are registered on the Watson IoT platform. These sensors  send various data to the Watson IBM platform.  3. Using Node-RED-based orchestration, the sensors’ data are analyzed by the  4. The Driver Behavior service uses the blockchain service and executes smart  Driver Behavior service.  contracts.

We ﬁrst described several important blockchain platforms such as Bit- coin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Stellar. In addition, we presented and discussed various important AI and IoT platforms. Lastly, we suggested an object-oriented approach for designing modern applications and also possible case studies of our approach [46, 47, 58, 59].  References  1.

Kanhere  Abstract The exponential increase in connected devices with built-in sensing, processing, and communication capabilities has fuelled the development of IoT applications, which creates new ecosystems for device-to-device interactions, sup- ports smart environments, and leads to new business models. Empowered by these capabilities, IoT devices interact with each other and their environments to collect, process, and share data. Security, privacy, and reliability of data are major con- cerns that need to be addressed for the development of IoT applications. Recently, blockchain technology has attracted signiﬁcant interest from researchers and indus- try leaders due to its potential for enhancing security, privacy, and reliability of the data. Blockchain offers distributed and immutable ledgers for IoT communications in the form of tamper-proof records, built-in cryptocurrency support for transac- tions between devices and other entities, and smart contracts to execute automated programs when certain conditions are met. Although there are potential beneﬁts of the integration of blockchain technology to IoT, the integration introduces new challenges, such as scalability, in the design of blockchains suited for IoT applica- tions. In this chapter, we explore key beneﬁts and design challenges for blockchain technologies, and potential applications of blockchain technologies for IoT.  V. Dedeoglu  B  · R. Jurdak · A.

While this enables a broad range of new services, it also introduces challenges of securing the data and maintaining individual pri- vacy. Current approaches to IoT security and privacy are largely centralized, which limits their scalability and imposes trust in a central entity. This raises the need for decentralized trust mechanisms in IoT.  One candidate technology for trusted IoT is blockchain. Blockchain is an append- only distributed database that records transactions in blocks as shown in Fig. 1. First proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto as the technology behind Bitcoin [1], blockchain is built on peer-to-peer networking, public key cryptography, and distributed databases to establish distributed consensus among network participants without a centralized trust broker. In a blockchain network, transactions are grouped in blocks, which are generated by miners following a distributed consensus mechanism. The ﬁrst block of a blockchain is called the genesis block. Each following block is linked to the previous block by a cryptographic hash pointer to form an immutable chain of blocks. Any attempt to change the contents of a block is easily detectable as the hash value of the changed block would create an inconsistency of hash values for the following blocks. Thus, to update a block without being detected, all of the following blocks should be regenerated following the consensus mechanism, which requires signiﬁcant computation power or resource consumption. This expensive process prevents malicious users to attack the network by changing block contents. Furthermore, blockchain is a distributed ledger and every participating network node has a copy of the ledger. Thus, it is reliable against node failures or attacks against nodes.  As the ﬁrst application of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is built on a limited scripting language and an energy-intensive consensus mechanism called Proof-of- Work  PoW . These constraints limit the range of applications that can be imple- mented on Bitcoin blockchain. Although blockchain was ﬁrst introduced as the enabling technology for cryptocurrencies and currency transactions, it is a versatile technology and there are many potential use cases beyond monetary applications that would beneﬁt from it. In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed the Ethereum blockchain [2]. Ethereum blockchain extends the potential applications of blockchain technology by building on a Turing-complete programming language and allowing new consensus mechanisms. An essential feature of the Ethereum blockchain is the implementation of smart contracts, which were ﬁrst introduced by Nick Szabo in 1994 [3]. Smart   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  57  Fig. 1 Structure of a blockchain: each block consists of a header and a list of transactions. The blocks are linked together with hash pointers to form an immutable chain  contracts are computerized protocols for executing the terms of a contract when cer- tain conditions are met. Smart contracts on Ethereum can make transfers between addresses, record information on the chain, make decisions, and interact with other smart contracts. Using smart contracts and less energy-intensive consensus mech- anisms, such as Proof-of-Stake  PoS , developers have built applications beyond monetary functions.  In early 2016, Linux Foundation established the Hyperledger Project [4]. Supported by major ﬁnancial, technological, and supply chain companies, Hyper- ledger provides a framework for developing cross-industry blockchain solutions with application-speciﬁc mechanisms for membership management, access control, consensus, and smart contract integration to improve the performance and reliability of business transactions.  Recently, blockchain-based mechanisms for IoT applications have attracted sig- niﬁcant attention due to their potential for improving security, privacy, and reliability of IoT applications. In a blockchain-based IoT application, blockchain may function as a platform for IoT device communications, IoT device access and control, digital asset creation, transfer of digital assets between network participants, and recording all these activities on an immutable and distributed ledger. The distributed ledger provides a tamper-proof history of recorded activities in the network. Blockchain technology also eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries for transactions among untrusted network participants. Alternative to the traditional blockchain structures, other distributed ledger technologies have also been proposed for IoT applications. For example, IOTA is a distributed ledger technology which is based on directed   58  V. Dedeoglu et al.  acyclic graphs [5]. The data structure of IOTA does not need miners or blocks to store transactions.  In this chapter, we propose blockchain as a promising technology for IoT applications. We discuss the key beneﬁts of using blockchain technologies for IoT applications, and the challenges in the blockchain integration for IoT. The chapter covers the potential blockchain use cases in IoT, including smart cities, supply chains, sharing economy services, and insurance and liability services. Finally, we discuss open issues for future research directions.  1.2 IoT Challenges  IoT has a broad range of industry, consumer, and defense applications including smart buildings, smart cities, health monitoring, asset tracking, and environmental monitoring by collection, processing, and dissemination of vast amounts of data. However, IoT security and privacy remain a major challenge mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks, which consist of resource- constrained, heterogeneous IoT devices. In many cases, the data collected by the IoT devices is security and privacy-critical or contains privacy-sensitive information and the IoT network becomes the target of cyberattacks [6].  Centralized security and communication architectures: State-of-the-art secu- rity mechanisms are highly centralized. However, these centralized mechanisms are not well suited for IoT applications due to low scalability, many-to-one nature of the trafﬁc, and creating single point of attacks. Similarly, communication models based on centralized brokers, where all devices are identiﬁed, authenticated, and connected through cloud servers are unlikely to scale with the large number of IoT devices. Furthermore, the entire network operation relies on cloud servers, which creates a bottleneck and single point of failure [7].  Resource constraints: Most of the IoT devices have limited power, computation, bandwidth, and memory resources. Since the execution of core application function- ality consumes most of their limited resources, lightweight mechanisms are needed to support security and privacy. Traditional security and privacy mechanisms which require high energy consumption and result in high communication and processing overhead are not suitable for most IoT applications.  User privacy: IoT applications may require collecting, processing, and exchang- ing privacy-sensitive data. Many existing IoT implementations completely ignore the user privacy issue despite the serious consequences. To protect user privacy, con- ventional methods often summarize or add noise to the privacy-sensitive data before revealing it to the IoT service providers. Since the data sent to the service provider is degraded or incomplete, this may potentially reduce the quality of personalized services offered by IoT service providers [8].  Consequently, IoT applications require lightweight, scalable, and distributed secu- rity and privacy mechanisms. Blockchain technology has the potential to address the aforementioned challenges as a result of its salient features which include decentral- ization, security, privacy, and immutability. In the next section, the beneﬁts of using blockchain-based technologies for IoT applications will be discussed.   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  59  1.3 Beneﬁts of Using Blockchain-Based Technologies for IoT  Recently, there has been a growing interest in the exploration of blockchain-based technologies for IoT due to the following potential beneﬁts:  Tamper-proof recording: The transactions recorded on a blockchain are tamper- proof due to the hash linking of the blocks and the distributed consensus mechanism. This provides a permanent transaction and communication history and secure data acquisition for IoT.  Distributed architecture: The distributed nature of the blockchain ensures that there is no single point of failure or single point of attack in the system and data is protected against IoT device failures or tampering. The distributed architecture also improves scalability and prevents network bottlenecks.  Transparency: The time-stamped transactions recorded on the blockchain are transparent and traceable. This adds the transactions a degree of accountability that has not existed before. Network participants can easily verify the transactions recorded on a blockchain and make sure that the transactions are not tampered or removed.  Trustless consensus: IoT applications involve communications and transactions between IoT systems that do not necessarily trust each other. Conventional architec- tures use trusted intermediaries to establish trust between untrusted parties. However, blockchain-based IoT applications are based on distributed consensus, which estab- lishes agreement among untrusted nodes in the network and eliminates the necessity to use trusted intermediaries.  Privacy: Blockchain technology may improve privacy by keeping the IoT transactions anonymous. In a blockchain network, nodes may use public keys as pseudonymous addresses. By using a different public key for each new transaction, each new transaction is linked to a different address, and it becomes difﬁcult to infer any information about the node identities just by examining the transactions on blockchain. Other blockchain-based privacy-preserving mechanisms use access con- trol, transaction mixing techniques, encryption methods, and delayed transactions. Smart contracts: Blockchain serves as a virtual space for deploying and executing autonomous contracts. These smart contracts are executed when certain predeﬁned conditions are met without the need for intermediaries. In IoT applications, smart contracts may be used to set the rules of the application, automate processes, and enable seamless communications and transactions between IoT devices and other entities.  Despite the potential beneﬁts of using blockchain technology for IoT, the adoption of the technology depends on the design of blockchains suited to IoT applications. High resource consumption, scalability, and slow transaction processing times are persisting problems for the integration of blockchain technologies for IoT. Further- more, the required blockchain functionalities in terms of control, access, consensus mechanisms, and network structure can differ across IoT applications. In the next section, blockchains will be classiﬁed according to these functionalities.   60  V. Dedeoglu et al.  2 Blockchain-Based Architectures for Solving IoT  Challenges  Blockchain-based architectures can be integrated to a wide range of IoT applications with distinct requirements and constraints. In this section, blockchain-based archi- tectures will be classiﬁed according to access, control, consensus mechanisms, and network structures.  2.1 Public, Private, or Consortium Blockchains  According to the access mechanisms, blockchains are categorized into three classes: public, private, and consortium, as shown in Table 1.  Public blockchains: In a public blockchain, anyone can join the network and access the transparent transaction history recorded on the blockchain. The public blockchain transactions and identities of the network participants are anonymous. Every node in the network has a copy of the distributed ledger, which is generated by a distributed consensus mechanism. Public blockchains are resilient against attacks and node failures due to the redundancy in the network and the consensus mecha- nism. However, the distributed consensus mechanism causes latencies, lower network throughput, and inefﬁciency. Network participants may earn economic incentives for contributing to the consensus mechanism such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Examples of public blockchains include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.  Table 1 Blockchain classiﬁcation according to access mechanisms  Private  Consortium  Network structure Controlled by  Public  Decentralized All network participants  Efﬁciency Security  Privacy  Low Higher due to distribution Low—all transactions are transparent  Centralized Trusted entity  blockchain owner   High Lower due to centralization High—access to data is controlled by the trusted entity  Use case examples  Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.  Company-owned blockchains, government applications  Partially decentralized Predetermined group of network participants Medium Average due to partial distribution Medium—access to data is controlled by a group of network participants Consortium of companies, multiple government agencies, Hyperledger, Quorum, Corda, Ripple, etc.   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  61  Private blockchains: In a private blockchain, a single organization controls the blockchain by determining the rules of the network and access permissions. Trust is centralized at the owner, yet there may be partial decentralization among many nodes managing blockchain that are controlled by the owner. By only letting the nodes with access permissions read the transactions on the blockchain, privacy of the transactions is improved. The consensus is established by the trusted entity, which improves the efﬁciency and results in faster transactions. The private blockchain architecture is more suitable for companies or government applications.  Consortium blockchains: Consortium blockchains are developed for applica- tions that involve a group of participants interacting with each other, where the consensus mechanism and maintenance of the blockchain are governed by a predeter- mined group of network participants. Consortium blockchains help the standardiza- tion of communication and transactions between the participating nodes. The access mechanism of the consortium blockchain deﬁnes the rules of access to the blockchain information. Similar to private blockchains, consortium blockchains are more efﬁ- cient and provide higher transaction privacy than public blockchains. Consortium blockchains are suitable for applications that involve multiple companies or agencies.  2.2 Permissioned Versus Permissionless Participation  Mechanisms  According to their control mechanisms, blockchains can be classiﬁed as permission- less or permissioned. Table 2 maps permissioned and permissionless blockchains to access-based classiﬁcations deﬁned above.  Permissionless blockchains: Any node can join the blockchain and participate in creating and verifying transactions, contributing to the consensus mechanism. Permissionless blockchains use tokenized incentives for establishing consensus and network participants earn monetary or utility tokens for their contributions in the consensus mechanism. With no central governance and distributed structure, per- missionless blockchains have resilience against attacks and censorship. The network operation is transparent so that network participants know how the blockchain works  Table 2 Control- and access-based blockchain classiﬁcation  Permissionless Read  Write  Any  Join  Any  Public  Any  Permissioned Read  Write  Any  Private  Authorized nodes  Consortium Authorized  nodes  Authorized nodes Authorized nodes  Authorized nodes Authorized nodes  Authorized nodes Authorized nodes  Authorized nodes Operator  Consortium validators  Join  Any  Authorized nodes Authorized nodes   62  V. Dedeoglu et al.  and how consensus is achieved. Permissionless blockchain participants may choose to stay anonymous. While anonymity improves user privacy, users may choose to become pseudonymous or reveal their identities for different applications or getting better personalized services. Permissionless blockchains may have lower scalabil- ity and suffer from slower transaction times and lower throughputs. Permissionless blockchains have use cases for consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer interactions.  Permissioned blockchains: The participating nodes are predeﬁned and they have permissions to participate in the blockchain. Permissioned blockchains allow an orga- nization or a group of organizations to record communications, events, and transac- tions in an immutable manner. The blockchain is controlled by an organization or a group of organizations, and the level of decentralization depends on the structure of the network interactions. Permissioned blockchains can use consensus mechanisms that are less computationally expensive. This improves the scalability, transaction times, and network throughput when compared to the permissionless blockchains. Permissioned blockchains provide conﬁdentiality of information recorded on the blockchain, which is an appealing feature for business operations. Thus, the main use case for permissioned blockchains is business-to-business interactions.  2.3 Consensus Mechanisms  Consensus mechanisms are required to agree on the state of the distributed ledger shared by the nodes and ensure security when there is no central authority to control the state of the ledger. A blockchain guarantees that the information stored on the ledger is unaltered by linking it to previously stored information on the blockchain and validating the authenticity of the information based on digital signatures. In order to achieve this, distributed consensus algorithms can be performed by the nodes, which do not necessarily trust each other. The consensus algorithm prevents malicious nodes of mining fake transactions and blocks and ensures randomness among the miners. Most of the existing consensus algorithms demand the participat- ing nodes to spend computational resources to solve a puzzle to be able to mine a block. To prevent malicious miners from ﬂooding the network with fake blocks, the consensus algorithms limit the number of blocks that can be generated in speciﬁc time periods by adjusting the difﬁculty of the puzzle. The unreliable nature of the peer environment where a blockchain is executed should be considered in choosing the appropriate consensus algorithm to be performed. In an IoT context, the resource constraints of IoT devices, such as computing power, memory, and storage, are key considerations for the choice of consensus algorithms.  The adoption of the consensus depends mainly on three factors: the architecture in which it will be used, the hardware requirements, and the attack vector that is intended to be mitigated. Consequently, the number of nodes and the processing overhead are important issues to be considered when choosing the consensus algorithm. Table 3 presents an overview of the consensus algorithms related to the   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  63  access to the blockchain, blockchain control approach, and positive and negative aspects for IoT. In this section, we will describe these consensus algorithms and discuss their implications for IoT applications.  Proof-of-Work  PoW  involves solving a resource consuming cryptographic puz- zle to control the generation of new blocks. Usually, PoW task requires miners to ﬁnd a nonce value to be included in the block such that the hash of the new block is smaller than a target value. Furthermore, the difﬁculty can be adjusted over time to control the block generation rate  i.e., the smaller the target hash value, the more difﬁcult the task is . After a new block is created, it is broadcasted to other nodes. Upon receiving the new block, the other nodes can verify the PoW by recalculating the hash value and comparing it with the hash value included in the received block. They can also verify the transactions included in the block before appending it to their copy of the distributed ledger. There are different implementations of PoW varying in the algorithm to perform the “work”—Bitcoin uses SHA-256 to perform the hash, while Litecoin uses Scrypt—and the structure of validation of the block—IOTA uses Tangle [9]. IOTA is the most prominent adopter of PoW consensus for blockchain in IoT. However, PoW algorithms tend to have a high impact on battery and processing limited devices. Additionally, PoW is mostly used in reward-based consensus, where miners are incentivized to contribute in the consensus mechanism and receive coins to perform the “work”.  Table 3 Overview of consensus algorithms for blockchains in IoT Consensus algorithm  Positive aspects for IoT  Control  Access  Public  Public  Permissionless Few messages  exchanged to achieve consensus  Permissionless Scalable, lower power  consumption  PoSpace  Public  Permissionless Lower power consumption  Private Consortium  Permissionless Less hardware energy  Pow  PoS  PBFT  dBFT  Private Consortium  Permissioned  FBA  Private Consortium  Permissioned  IBFT  Private Consortium  Permissionless Less hardware energy  RAFT  Private Consortium  Permissionless Less hardware energy  requirements Scalable and less hardware energy requirements Scalable and less hardware energy requirements  requirements  requirements  Negative aspects for IoT  High energy and computing consumption Overload in few nodes can impact in the operation of the blockchain Requires high amount of memory storage Not scalable  Problems in dynamic scenarios  It is required that “important” nodes are trusted Not scalable, produces empty blocks Not scalable, serialization of requests   64  V. Dedeoglu et al.  Proof-of-Stake  PoS  is an alternative to the PoW algorithm. In order to reduce the difﬁculty of the block generation task, PoS uses a random selection of nodes based on wealth or aging of coins [10]. PoS preserves a single branch, as only a single node is responsible for producing a block. Although PoS has the objective to reduce the processing needed to create a block, to the best of our knowledge, there is no blockchain for IoT using PoS consensus. One problem with PoS in IoT is that it can lead to a centralization of the consensus in a few nodes, which creates a single point of attack, partially centralizes trust, and limits scalability.  Proof-of-Space  PoSpace  was proposed to ensure a more energy-efﬁcient solu- tion than PoW. PoSpace can focus both on transient or persistent space. Usually, PoSpace uses Memory-Hard Functions  MHF  or proof of secure erasure functions, which require memory- space-intensive computations. One advantage of this method is that a veriﬁer only needs a small amount of space and computation to check the results produced by the node that produced the block [11]. Although it has a lower energy consumption, it requires higher memory or storage space in the nodes that contribute to the consensus mechanism. Consequently, PoSpace is not suitable for IoT applications with resource-constrained devices, where memory and storage are limited.  Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance  pBFT  is the ability of a distributed net- work to correctly reach consensus when a subset of the nodes is faulty or malicious. When there are f faulty nodes in the network, pBFT requires 3f +1 nodes to correctly reach consensus. When a new block is created, a leader node is selected. Then, the leader node starts the consensus mechanism by sending the block to the active vali- dation nodes in the network for validation. If more than 2 3 of the active validation nodes vote to validate the new block, the block is appended to the blockchain [12]. PBFT has been used by many blockchain proposals for IoT for the last few years. However, pBFT mechanism suffers from poor scalability. In a large network, the number of messages and the waiting time for node responses can be high. Addition- ally, in a dynamic P2P scenario, where nodes frequently leave and rejoin the network, achieving consensus becomes difﬁcult as active nodes can change their status during the consensus.  Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance  dBFT  similar to pBFT, it achieves con- sensus on new information based on votes. However, in the dBFT, validators  nodes that validate and vote  are elected by the requester for each consensus. If requester does not trust in a chosen validator, requester can elect another node as validator for the next consensus procedure. Then, the validators choose a node to be the leader  Elected Validator “A” in Fig. 2  that will create the block and start the consensus procedure  step 2 in Fig. 2 . Consequently, just a small subset of the nodes is used to perform the consensus in dBFT [13]. When more than 2 3 of elected nodes validate the information, it is considered valid  in step 3, nodes A, B, and C vote positively, so the new block is considered valid . Neo is one of ﬁrst blockchains that adopted dBFT-based consensus algorithm. This solution can solve the scaling issue of pBFT, reducing the number of nodes that will perform the consensus. However, in dynamic IoT scenarios, it can still present a problem when elected nodes are not reliable.

Each node knows a set of other “important” nodes  also called Quorum slice —that are predeﬁned by each node based on arbitrary criteria such as ﬁnancial arrangements. When performing the consensus, a requester node initiates  e.g., node A in Fig. 3  the consensus algorithm and waits for the important nodes to validate  nodes B and C in Fig. 3  the new information. Those important nodes will validate the information when their Quorum slices validate as well  e.g., B will validate when D and E Quorum slices validate as well . Eventually, enough number of the nodes in the network  also called as Quorum  validate the information and it can be inserted in the blockchain [14]. In this algorithm, only a subset of the network is used to perform the consensus and it is performed by groups  federations . Stellar is one of the most prominent adopters of this algorithm.  Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance  IBFT  also requires that more than 2 3 of the active nodes in the blockchain to validate the new information to be inserted. However, the proposer  the node that starts controls the consensus procedure  can be selected in a “round robin” way. The proposer node starts the consensus without having to choose a leader. IBFT is considered an adaption of pBFT and can be used to produce new blocks in a constant rate by different nodes [15]. Due to the insertion of blocks in a constant rate, empty blocks  with no transactions information  can be created. In IoT scenarios, these empty blocks can lead to unnecessary overhead.  RAFT also needs 2f +1 nodes to be set up in the network to have the capability to tolerate f faulty nodes and has a leader that starts the validation. However, unlike IBFT, it does not create empty blocks and the time to change the leader is randomized. The leader handles all node requests and sends them to all the followers  other nodes in the network  to perform the validation [16]. The main issue with RAFT is that all the information is serialized through a leader that manages the consensus through a randomized amount of time. In an untrusted IoT scenario, this leader can be overloaded by requests or can be targeted by malicious nodes.   66  V. Dedeoglu et al.

However, these algorithms are less adopted in blockchains and do not present advantages for IoT environments compared to the previously presented. The search for consensus mechanisms for blockchains that can match the IoT requirements is an active research area both in academy and industry.  2.4 Blockchain Architectures for IoT  Blockchain architectures for IoT vary based on the application requirements. Figure 4 presents the three main architectures adopted by different blockchain proposal for IoT: fully distributed, gateway based  or hierarchical , and Blockchain-as-a-Service. The most common adopted architecture is a completely decentralized architec- ture, where each node is a full node, i.e., every device communicates directly to other devices in the network to update the blockchain. This kind of architecture is adopted by most public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, it requires all   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  67  e c i v r e S - a - s a - n  i a h c k c o l B  d e s a b - y a w e t a G  d e t u b  i r t s i D y l e t e l     p m o C  e c i v e D  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  e c i v e D  e c i v e D  w G  w G  e c i v e D  w G  e c i v e D  e c i v e D  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  l l  u F  e d o N  T o I n i  n i a h c k c o l b  r o f  s e r u t c e t i h c r a P 2 P  t n e r e f f i  D  4  .  g i F   68  V. Dedeoglu et al.  devices to have enough computing power, battery, memory, and storage for maintain- ing the blockchain [17]. In IoT scenarios with heterogeneous devices—with different hardware capabilities and limitations—this kind of architecture risks compromising the security of the devices, especially against Denial-of-Service  DoS  attacks.  Some proposals adopt a hierarchical P2P architecture shown as the gateway- based architecture in Fig. 4. In that architecture, supernodes  also called gateways or overlays  are used to control the access to the data in a blockchain and to perform the consensus algorithm [18, 19]. This kind of solution leads to a reduction on the trafﬁc generated through the local network and decreases the vulnerability of the constrained devices. Moreover, some proposals execute smart contracts on the blockchain supernodes, thus reducing processing on limited devices. However, these architectures are more susceptible to some attacks, such as Eclipse attack [20], i.e., when a malicious gateway controls the device’s communication. In this architecture, trust is concentrated in a limited set of nodes  gateways overlays , which increases the risks of malicious activities in these nodes.  Another architecture—called Blockchain-as-a-Service—uses different nodes to control the blockchain and to participate in the IoT network as shown in Fig. 4. Consequently, all the processing of the blockchain can be performed by third-party infrastructure, reducing the hardware requirements in IoT devices. For example, in the work presented by Boudguiga et al. [21], IoT device availability is updated in the blockchain through encrypted messages. However, the trust is delegated to a third- party authentication authority, i.e., the IoT devices are susceptible to security issues of the third-party blockchain.  The appropriate blockchain architecture highly depends on the speciﬁcs of an IoT application. The available architectures provide a spectrum of performance across multiple dimensions. Fully decentralized networks maximize trust resilience yet incur more bandwidth overhead and are less scalable. BaaS is at the other end of the spectrum, where the service provider can provision the computing infrastructure to maintain the blockchain, yet trust is centralized at the provider and is therefore less robust to malicious behavior. The hierarchical architecture provides a mid-spectrum approach on both trust centralization and overhead, and has been the preferred choice for many proposed architectures.  3 Example Blockchain-Based IoT Applications  3.1 Smart Cities  This section discusses the blockchain applications and challenges for smart cities and smart buildings. A smart city incorporates a wide range of sensors and devices which collect data of the smart city and share them with service providers. This data can be used to manage the assets in the smart city or to offer real-time personalized   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  69  services to the citizens and improve the efﬁciency of urban services such as utilities, energy, and transportation.  Intelligent Transportation Systems  ITS  are an integral part of smart cities. ITS use sensing, communication, analytics, and control to improve the safety and efﬁciency of city-wide transportation systems. Future connected vehicles interacting with ITS of smart cities will be equipped with a substantial number of sensors  such as Global Positioning System  GPS , dashboard cameras, Light Detection and Ranging  LIDAR , etc.  that will produce large volumes of data. Research by Intel predicts that future vehicles will produce 4 TB of data every day [22]. The data produced by the smart vehicles will be used by smart urban infrastructures to offer services, e.g., available parking spots or green-light assistance.  The authors in [23] discussed the potential beneﬁts and limitation of using blockchain in smart connected vehicles. Centralization, safety, and lack of privacy are introduced as the key limitations of existing centralized solutions which in turn motivates the shift toward distributed blockchain-based platforms. The authors also proposed a blockchain-based framework which clusters the participating nodes in the network and only the cluster heads  CHs  manage the blockchain. This reduces the packet and processing overhead for managing the blockchain. The authors discussed the applicability of the proposed platform in wireless remote software update for autonomous vehicles, insurance, electric vehicle charging, and car-sharing services. Finally, managing keys of the smart vehicles, caching the exchanged data to reduce overhead and delay, and mobility of the connected vehicles are introduced as future research directions.  In [24], the authors proposed SpeedyChain, a blockchain-based framework to establish trust while maintaining the privacy of the vehicles in smart cities. In Speedy- Chain, the smart vehicles register their key in public blockchain that is used for vehicle authentication. Once a vehicle generates a transaction that contains the data of the vehicle or the trafﬁc data, it populates the PK that is registered in the blockchain along with the corresponding sign. Thus, the receiver of the transaction can verify that the generator of the transaction is a genuine vehicle by checking if the PK of the transaction is registered in the blockchain. Using this method, the vehicle has to generate all its transactions with a unique key, thus all participants can track the vehicle owner’s activities which in turn may lead to user deanonymization and com- promises his privacy. To address this challenge, each vehicle can change its key periodically. The new key is then registered in the blockchain which maintains the vehicle anonymity.  Due to its salient features  see Sect. 1.3 , blockchain has attracted tremendous attention to provide a distributed secure platform for smart buildings and in particular energy management. One of the most critical tasks in smart buildings is to manage the energy based on the load in the grid or the price of the energy. In [25], the authors proposed a Secure Private Blockchain-based framework  SPB  for distributed energy trading. SPB empowers the energy producer and consumer to trade energy without relying on Trusted Third Parties  TTPs  by introducing atomic-meta transactions. In an atomic meta-transaction, a constituent transaction is considered to be valid if and only if it is coupled with at least one other transaction. The consumer generates a   70  V. Dedeoglu et al.  Commit To Pay  CTP  transaction, committing to pay a speciﬁc amount of money to the producer. The generation of CTP places a hold on the committed money, so that the consumer can no longer pay this amount to any other node; however, the money is not yet transferred to the producer account until the producer has transferred energy to the consumer. Once energy is transferred, the consumer’s smart meter conﬁrms receipt of energy by generating an Energy Receipt Conﬁrmation  ERC  transaction. The atomic meta-transaction, that consists of CTP and ERC, is then mined in the blockchain and the committed money is paid out to the energy producer. It is critical for the blockchain participants to be able to verify that the ERC is generated by a genuine smart meter. The transactions generated by the smart meter, reveal privacy-sensitive information about the consumer that includes the energy consumption pattern. To enhance the anonymity of the smart meter, SPB introduces a Certiﬁcate of Existence  CoE . Each smart meter constructs a Merkle tree of a number of PKs and sends the root of the tree to another smart meter to sign which serves as the CoE. Each time that the smart meter generates a transaction, it uses the CoE used for verifying that the transaction was generated by a smart meter.  In addition to academia, using blockchain for energy trading also received atten- tion from industry. Powerledger [26] proposed a blockchain-based energy market that enables energy producer and consumer to trade energy in a distributed man- ner. The users initially need to buy token in a public blockchain and then join the Powerledger blockchain to participate in energy trading.  3.2 Logistics and Supply Chains  One of the strengths of blockchain is its immutability, which provides an auditable trail of information useful for traceability in supply chains, especially when coupled with sensor data that observe events during the shipment and handling process in a supply chain. The key beneﬁt of using blockchain over databases for these applications is the inherent multi-party nature of interactions, and where the parties are naturally in a commercially competitive environment. Sensor values obtained from IoT sensors can add trust for real-time immutable data when stored on blockchains. Most popular is the use of Time and Temperature Sensors  TTI  and Global Positioning System  GPS , along with Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation  RFID  for quality and tracking purposes. There has been signiﬁcant interest from the industry in developing blockchain-based platforms for supporting traceability in supply chains. Some of the projects underway include IBM and Walmart [27], Block-Verify [28], Provenance [29], and Hyperledger [4]. However, these systems are proprietary and thus speciﬁc details are not available in the public domain and there is a critical need for a holistic model where organizations abide some standard rules and no organization is able to control the blockchain. Apart from industry, some recent literature for blockchain-based traceability systems is given below.  Feng [30] presents a blockchain-based architecture for the agri-food supply chain. The high-level conceptual design is based on public blockchain and IoT sensor data.   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  71  The authors extend their work [31] to address scalability by leveraging distributed databases such as BigChain. However, their approach uses blockchain as a blackbox and thus they do not elaborate on implementation details or consider challenges associated with incorporating blockchain in the FSC context such as the type of blockchain used, accessibility, and auditability.  A blockchain-based wine traceability system is proposed in [32]. The authors use blockchain to obtain a secure, authenticated information to verify origin and purchase history of wine bottles. The proposed framework is implemented using Multichain, an open platform for implementing private blockchain solutions. Their design proposes to use selected supply chain entities such as wine producer and bulk distributors as miners and thus responsible for verifying blocks. Once veriﬁed, these blocks are added to the ledger and information such as origin, production, and purchase history is available to other supply chain entities if made public. However, their approach does not address scalability. Moreover, it is unclear how ingredients of wine can be traced apart from the provenance of individual bottle.  In [33], the authors propose to maintain ownership information of manufactured goods on the blockchain as they make their way through the distribution chain to prevent counterfeiting. The products are coupled with RFID tags as they leave man- ufacturers and the information in RFID tag is updated when the product is traded among different entities, storing ownership details on every transit. When a prod- uct reaches the retailer, a consumer can reject the product if the product history lacks ownership information of the seller she is buying from. While it is an effective approach for traceability of products from manufacturer to retailers, the provenance of information prior to manufacturing, e.g., the originator of the raw materials can- not be obtained. Abeyratne [34] proposed a very similar approach for manufacturing supply chains and presented a use case of cardboard manufacturing.  The authors in [35] propose a permissioned blockchain framework which is governed by a consortium of key Food Supply Chain  FSC  entities including government and regulatory bodies to promote food provenance. They propose to use a shared, three-tiered architecture which ensures availability of data to consumers, limits access to competitive partners, and provides scalability for handling trans- action load. The ﬁrst tier involves the blockchain participants and non-participants, such as consumers. The participants record all transfers of goods on the blockchain. Tier 2 nodes are validators that manage side chains  shards , while tier 3 involves a global validator and a query engine. The authors also propose a transaction vocabu- lary and access rights to manage read and write privileges to blockchain supported by the consortium. The framework, termed ProductChain, ensures that trade ﬂows are kept conﬁdential when provenance information is retrieved by consumers and stake- holders. Simulation results show that query time for a product ledger is of the order of a few milliseconds even when the information is collated from multiple shards. Product chain is generalized and applicable to supply chains in diverse industries.   72  V. Dedeoglu et al.  3.3 Sharing Economy Services  In broad terms, sharing economy refers to economic activities that involve shar- ing, exchanging, and rental of under-utilized assets and services for collaborative consumption. Sharing economies aim to increase efﬁciency by higher utilization of assets and services and reduced transaction and operation costs.  Traditionally, sharing marketplaces have been dependent on trust between users, and the required trust has been established by the sharing economy companies that act as middlemen in the marketplace. Although the customers perceive the service they receive as peer-to-peer in most cases, the actual marketplace is centralized and controlled by leading sharing economy companies. These companies are responsible for handling user data, matching customers with service providers, making sure that customers receive the service they have requested and service providers are paid for their service. In the case of disputes, sharing economy companies act as intermediaries to resolve issues. For these services, sharing economy companies charge users a service fee.  Blockchain-based technologies introduce a new trust-free transaction model that depends on the trust created by the entire network rather than the direct trust between service providers and consumers. Based on this new trust model, users with no trust, or even negative trust, can participate in transactions without the need for trusted inter- mediaries. By eliminating the shared economy companies between service providers and consumers, blockchain-based distributed platforms reduce the costs and time delays incurred by the traditional transaction mechanisms.  Currently, most sharing markets have been owned or controlled by centralized servers or operators. In contrast, blockchain allows for decentralized peer-to-peer transactions. The decentralization improves the privacy and security of transactions. In a decentralized platform, there is no single authority or controller that can have access to the private data of users. The privacy of users can be further improved by techniques based on changing addresses  public keys  for new transactions on the blockchain. Since the ledger is distributed among users, each user has a copy of the blockchain, and the system is secure against single points of vulnerabilities or failures.  Furthermore, companies and governments have the power to control the central- ized sharing marketplaces. A sharing economy company may decide to shut down the service or decide not to serve a speciﬁc group of customers, or a government may regulate the operations of a marketplace by applying censorship. The blockchain- based sharing markets have higher resistance against regulations, censorship, and discrimination by companies and governments. On a blockchain platform, there is no single company to control the market, the users have higher anonymity against service discrimination, and governments have limited power to apply censorship.  With the increasing Internet connectivity and wide adoption of mobile technolo- gies, the sharing economy ecosystem has been dominated by Internet-based sharing economy companies such as Uber, Airbnb, and eBay. When these leading ride- sharing, home-sharing, and marketplace online platforms were ﬁrst introduced, they   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  73  were considered as disruptive technologies shaping the sharing economy ecosys- tem. Blockchain-based IoT applications have the potential to disrupt these technolo- gies further by making them more distributed through peer-to-peer interactions, and automated by IoT integration and smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. This potential has been investigated by the early adopters of the technology in sharing economy services platforms  ShareRing, OpenBazaar , ride-sharing  Arcade City, La’zooz, SnagRide , keyless access and smart locks  Airlock.me, Slock.it , home- sharing  Bee Token, CryptoBnB , and data-sharing  Streamr  applications. The inte- gration of IoT and blockchain-based technologies may enable sharing markets to achieve higher efﬁciency, improved data security, and user privacy by  Direct  interactions between service providers and consumers: On a blockchain-based sharing economy platform, service providers and customers may be matched using automated protocols. Technologies based on searchable encryption may be utilized for searching encrypted IoT data or service offers on the blockchain. A service provider may deploy a smart contract on the blockchain for the service offer. The marketplace rules are also deﬁned by the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. Service providers and customers commit to these rules by signing the smart contracts. With direct transactions between providers and consumers, the middlemen and associated costs and delays are eliminated.  Immutable record of transactions: The blockchain records the history of trans- actions such as payments, transfers of ownership, IoT device data in an immutable, and tamper-proof way. Since the blockchain is distributed among the users, each user has a copy of the transactions record.  Peer-to-peer payments: The sharing economy may be for proﬁt or nonproﬁt. Depending on the business model, the payments can be transferred through the blockchain in cryptocoins or tokens issued by sharing market platforms.  Access control of IoT devices through the chain: Blockchain-based platforms can be used as access control mechanisms for IoT devices used by the sharing econ- omy applications. This improves the security and privacy of the IoT technologies by limiting access for the IoT devices and IoT data to authorized users and recording the IoT device access history on the chain.  Dispute resolution on the chain: In case of a dispute, the tamper-proof trans- actions history on blockchain can be used for resolving the issues between users. Furthermore, multi-signature transactions feature of blockchain utilizes third-party escrow approvals for transactions to prevent disputes between users. In a multi- signature transaction scheme, the service provider and the consumer agree to trust a third party. Then, the consumer transfers the payment to an escrow account. When the consumer receives the service and there is no dispute, the payment is transferred to the service provider’s account. If there is a dispute, the trusted third party will be used for resolution. Depending on the trusted third party’s decision, the payments will be transferred to the service provider’s account or it will be transferred back to the consumer’s account.  Eliminating market entry barriers: Centralized sharing economies are dom- inated and controlled by big companies. Small companies or individual ser- vice providers face high entry barriers for the centralized sharing markets.   74  V. Dedeoglu et al.  Blockchain-based platforms eliminate these barriers and create new business oppor- tunities for small companies and individual service providers.  3.4 Insurance and Liability  In this section, we discuss the liability and insurance use cases of blockchain, focusing on the application of connected and autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with a wide range of Electronic Control Units  ECUs , sensors, and devices that capture, process, and transfer data of the vehicle to facilitate independent driving decisions. The ECUs make driving decision based on the captured data, thus should be considered while making liability decisions as not all functions of the vehicle are controlled by the driver. Consequently, for an accident, multiple entities might be involved from the manufacturer and software update provider, to the service center and driver.  Recall that blockchain is an immutable ledger of blocks, thus modifying or remov- ing any previously stored transaction is impossible without breaking blockchain consistency. This feature makes blockchain a potential solution to liability issue in smart connected vehicles. The authors in [36] proposed a blockchain-based liabil- ity framework to address this challenge. The proposed framework is built on top of permissioned blockchain where only authorized nodes can join blockchain and participate in mining blocks. The framework consists of two main tiers, namely,  i  operational and  ii  decision. The operational tier is where the blockchain is managed by all participating nodes that can be insurance companies, vehicles, manufactures, and roadside infrastructures. All communications, i.e., transactions, are stored in the blockchain. The decision tier comprises the legal authorities including police and courts. Requests to gather information and witnesses are generated by the insurance companies to the legal authorities. Simulation results prove that the proposed method reduces the processing time compared to the state-of-the-art methods.  The authors in [23] studied the blockchain applications for automotive insur- ance use cases. Once the vehicle owner signs contract with an insurance company, the vehicle registers a public key to be used for its transactions with the insurance company. This ensures that the insurance company can authenticate the user while protecting the user anonymity. The smart vehicle is equipped with a local storage to store privacy-sensitive data. The vehicle does not share such data with the insurance company until the data is requested, e.g., to solve liability issue, by the insurance company. To ensure the integrity of the data, the hash of local storage is periodically stored in the blockchain.  3.5 Smart Contracts for IoT  A smart contract allows the execution of a code inside a blockchain without a centralized control. Once deployed, the smart contract is permanent and it cannot   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  75  normally be altered. Any ﬂaw in the logic of the contract persists with it without the possibility of an update. A mechanism to disable a smart contract may be included in the development phase to provide ﬂexibility for avoiding identiﬁed bugs. In that case, the contract still persists in the blockchain but the logic of it prevents it from doing any operation. Additionally, after insertion in the blockchain, all smart contracts are available and are known to the other nodes in the network. Also, values stored within a smart contract are available to everyone in the blockchain. Consequently, smart contract content can be a concern for privacy-sensitive content. Since business logic can be applied to a smart contract, it has an ample scope of applications, such as resource allocation, traceability, and auditability. For example, a smart contract can be deployed and made accessible to a speciﬁc manufacturer of IoT devices. In the smart contract, the device can check the last version of ﬁrmware available and receive a hash of the newest version. If necessary, it can update itself to the last ﬁrmware. Another usage is related to coin exchange. For example, on blockchains that provide cryptocurrencies, a device can sell services to other devices  e.g., storage or information from sensors . Also, it can help to manage an IoT network with a list of devices and their permissions. This list is dynamic so new devices can be removed or added and permissions can be changed. In this use case, non-authorized entities are not allowed to interact with the devices in the network. Additionally, smart contracts can perform a load-balancing algorithm, analyzing the workload on the devices and assigning new tasks for idle devices.  Currently, smart grids are the most explored IoT application for smart contracts. One of the drivers is a push for a decentralized market, where energy can be freely produced and consumed without trusted third parties. In this environment, smart contracts can be used as market brokers where users of the network can offer excess or buy energy from the network in an automated way without the need for a central authority. An IoT device—controlling the energy grid of a house—can participate in a blockchain network and bid for energy in the region energy network. IoT devices controlling the energy grid can route the energy between the producer and consumer. Moreover, industrial IoT devices can be used to control the production in an auto- mated way. These devices can beneﬁt from the use of blockchains for management and control. Smart contracts can be used to allow machine-to-machine communica- tions, avoiding the need for human intervention to some extent. A smart contract can be used to control the access and permissions of IoT devices and users, increasing the security and giving a more transparent process where all activities can be audited. This approach is not exclusive to Industry 4.0, as any IoT network in most contexts can beneﬁt from management solutions in the blockchain.   76  4 Open Issues  V. Dedeoglu et al.  4.1 Lightweight Consensus Mechanisms  Recall that IoT consists of millions of resource-constrained devices that generate large numbers of transactions, i.e., communications, to share or request the data or services. The existing consensus algorithms suffer from  Resource consumption: Most of the existing consensus algorithms demand the participating nodes in the blockchain to spend resources to solve a puzzle or verify all new transactions and new blocks which in turn demands signiﬁcant resources from the participants. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained devices that may not be capable of performing such resource consuming tasks. Performing all necessary tasks for managing the blockchain consumes most of resources, particularly energy, of the IoT devices which in turn increases cost and decreases efﬁciency of using IoT devices.  Limited throughput: To ensure the security of the blockchain and prevent mali- cious miners from ﬂooding the network with fake blocks, the consensus algorithms have limited throughout. However, in IoT ecosystem, devices, users, and SPs generate millions of transactions to communicate and share data to achieve smart personalized services. The existing consensus algorithms have by far lower throughput compared to the throughput required by IoT.  Delay: Mining and verifying new blocks and transactions involve signiﬁcant time delay in existing blockchain solutions, e.g., in Bitcoin a transaction may take 30 min to be mined and conﬁrmed in the blockchain. To protect against double spending attacks where a malicious node transfers the same asset to two different users, it is essential for the receiver of a transaction to wait for X number of blocks to be mined after the block in which his transaction is stored. This time period is known as block conﬁrmation. Most of IoT applications demand real-time data or services, e.g., a smart door used to unlock a smart home should respond in real time to the homeowner requests to lock or unlock the door.  Lightweight consensus algorithms that address the aforementioned challenges are needed to apply blockchain for IoT while achieving low delay and high throughput.  4.2 IoT Security and Privacy  This section discusses known attacks that could be performed on blockchains and analyzes the most common attacks and their effects for IoT scenarios.  As the recent blockchain research and implementation are increasing, there has been increased focus on the security issues and attacks that blockchain can address. In order to identify these issues, Conti et al. [37] present a survey which covers security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin blockchain. As the Bitcoin blockchain is the   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  77  most popular blockchain running nowadays, it is important to understand the security issues and its effects on Bitcoin blockchain.  It is widely known that the Bitcoin blockchain does not ﬁt to the IoT domain, mainly due to its size and consensus algorithm  which relies heavily on the device processing power . Researchers have therefore explored new solutions for the IoT domain. Here, we highlight the most common security issues of blockchain technol- ogy and the key issues related to IoT scenarios.  There are a set of common attacks that could target blockchains, some of which exploit the consensus algorithm vulnerability, while others target the fork resolution algorithm  Fig. 5  or the blockchain data structure. The remainder of this section dis- cusses some of the most relevant attacks, and how they are affecting IoT blockchain, which blockchain layers are compromised by the attack and the affected security aspects  conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability :  Double spending or race: It consists of a malicious user sending multiple spend- ing transactions, using the same coin, one transaction addressed to his victim and another transaction transferring the coins to an address under his control [37]. Once the victim receives a notiﬁcation related to the transaction, the attacker sends the second transaction which transfers the same coins to the address under his control. Thus, it leads to the attacker transferring the coins from to wallets that are under his control, and the victim not being able to receive the coins. The main goal of this attack is to mislead the victim that some coins were transferred to his account, while in fact these coins were transferred to a malicious account under the attacker’s control. This attack compromises the blockchain consensus, data, and application layers. This is caused by concurrency and delay to insert new transactions, which is caused mainly due to the time to append a new block in the blockchain induced by the PoW consensus algorithm. This attack targets to compromise the blockchain integrity. Additionally, attacks such as Finney, Vector 76, and Alternative History are variants of the double spending attack and share the same attack goals. Dou- ble spending attacks can be effective in blockchains that use coins, for example, IoT applications that perform Machine-to-Machine  M2M  payments  e.g., IOTA blockchain, which was developed for M2M payments .  51% attack: It involves a malicious user controlling more than 50% of network processing power [38]. This user can rewrite the network blocks and control the  Fig. 5 Example of a fork in blockchain  Forked blockchain   78  V. Dedeoglu et al.  network behavior. This attack is focused on the consensus layer, which is applicable for blockchains that use the PoW consensus algorithm. Once the attack is successfully executed, the attacker is able to compromise the blockchain data layer and its integrity, as he could rewrite the blocks and tamper the chain history. In the IoT context, this attack draws special attention, as most of the devices present limited processing power, and to achieve 51% of network processing could be easier than a regular computer network. In order to mitigate this attack, many IoT blockchains propose the hierarchical architecture, where overlays gateways are responsible for managing the blockchain.  Selﬁsh mining: It involves a malicious user or a user pool mining and keeping all the mined blocks private and continuing this operation until its chain reaches a longer length than the main blockchain [39]. At this point, it publishes all the mined blocks, and following the fork rule, which discards the branch with fewer blocks, the attacker chain will become the main chain. This attack category exploits the blockchain fork algorithm and becomes attractive based on the reward mechanism.  Wallet threats: It is a category of attacks that include vulnerable signatures  mainly due to the weak randomness related to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signa- ture Algorithm  ECDSA  in creating random seeds to produce the public private key pair , collision  where a malicious user has enough processing power to ﬁnd a hash collision , and ﬂawed key generation  due to implementation issues of ECDSA or fault in libraries . This category exploits vulnerabilities that are commonly pre- sented by the wallets, their address management, and the cryptography algorithms. These threats deserve special attention due to processing, power, and memory limi- tations of common IoT devices, which could lead to security issues. To mitigate such threats, the design of blockchain-based IoT applications should follow established standards  such as NIST standard for ECDSA implementation and other libraries . Another approach for defense against wallet threats is the use of external hardware responsible for generating signatures [40].  Deanonymization: Public blockchains use public key mechanisms to hide the user identities. However, the user privacy could not be ensured only through this public key approach. It has been shown that through the information gathered by the client connections, it is possible to track and identify the client [41]. When most information that is stored in the blockchain is public, the idea of keeping the privacy of the device that produced it is a discussion that should be considered. The most common vectors exploited in this attack are the P2P network connection and the reuse of public keys  which are used to identify the wallet . A common approach to address this vulnerability is to change public keys periodically to reduce the risk of linking them back to the user identity. However, identity management remains an open issue for blockchain systems, including blockchain-based IoT applications.  Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks: These attacks are very common over the Internet and are focused on overloading a speciﬁc target in order to reduce the capability to respond to legitimate requests. The blockchain usually is conceived to run in a P2P architecture, which means if a node is compromised through a DDoS, the network itself keeps working. Thus, in case of a DDoS attack being performed in the Bitcoin blockchain, it could reduce a mining pool capability, leading other   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  Fig. 6 Node A is eclipsed by node B and node C  79  Node  D  Node  E  Node  G  Node  F  Node  A  Node  B  Node  C  pools miners more likely to ﬁnd a valid hash for a block [42]. This attack also needs special attention in IoT domain, as most of the IoT devices have limited resources, and thus become easy attractive targets for malicious users. Recently, compromising IoT nodes and exploiting them to launch DDoS attacks have also proven to be highly disruptive to the broader Internet [43].  Sybil attack: It is possible due to the public P2P network architecture. A malicious node claims multiple identities in the network [44]. Once these identities are under the control of the same malicious node, that node can inﬂuence the network behavior. This attack is performed in the network layer and it can lead to inconsistent blockchain ledgers  e.g., a node can have a different block sequence than another node in the blockchain network .  Eclipse attack: This attack involves a malicious user monopolizing a victim’s incoming and outgoing connections. Once the victim is isolated from the main blockchain network, the attacker can, for example, force the victim to waste his computing power calculating old blocks hashes [45]. For example, node A in Fig. 6 is eclipsed by the malicious nodes B and C. As a result of the eclipse attack, node A receives blocks and information ﬁltered or even tampered by the malicious nodes. This attack also enables double spending and selﬁsh mining attacks against the victim.  4.3 Scalability  Scalability is one of the major problems faced by current blockchain-based IoT applications. Low scalability of blockchain mechanisms may cause slow transac- tion validation, high transaction fees, high storage memory requirements, and long synchronization times. Scalability of blockchain problems stems from inefﬁcient consensus mechanisms and blockchain structures.   80  V. Dedeoglu et al.  Since an immutable blockchain is an append-only ledger, every new block increases the size of the blockchain shared by all fully participating nodes. The growing size of the blockchain demands more storage space, higher bandwidth, and computational power. As this demand increases, the number of nodes capable of sharing the distributed ledger and participating in the blockchain consensus mech- anism decreases. Thus, as the blockchain grows, it may become more centralized with only few nodes fully participating in the distributed consensus.  While distributed consensus establishes trust in the network, and provides increased security and reliability for IoT applications, it also puts a limit on the size and growth rate of the blockchain. The trade-off between decentralization and scalability implies low transaction throughput and slow transaction validation times, which reduce the adoptability of blockchain technologies for IoT applications.  The scalability of blockchain-based IoT applications can be improved by Consensus mechanisms suited for IoT: One approach to improve scalability is designing new consensus mechanisms suited for IoT applications. In [46], a tiered Lightweight Scalable Blockchain  LSB  optimized for IoT requirements was pro- posed. LSB uses an IoT friendly lightweight consensus algorithm and distributed trust and throughput management mechanism for improving scalability while achiev- ing decentralization through forming an overlay network that maintains a public blockchain for privacy and security.  Off-chain payment channels and off-chain computations: Another approach for tackling the scalability issue is using off-chain payment channels and off-chain computations to perform most of the transactions and computations off the chain for higher transaction throughput.  Sharding: Scalability of the blockchain can be improved by separating the blockchain state into shards, which are maintained by different sets of participat- ing nodes in the network. Sharding allows nodes to store and process a part of the blockchain state instead of the whole blockchain state.  DAG-based distributed ledger structures: Instead of requiring all of the fully participating nodes to process every transaction in a linear chain structure, IOTA [9] uses a Directed Acyclic Graph  DAG  structure. In IOTA, nodes need to vali- date only a predeﬁned number of transactions before proposing new transactions, which increases the throughput and provides shorter transaction validation times. For example, Fig. 7 represents a DAG-based distributed ledger, where valid blocks with at least two validations are represented with white color, while candidate blocks with one or no validation are represented with gray color.  4.4 Legal Aspects  Blockchain is a fast-moving technology with diverse range of applications, where regulations are falling behind innovations. In particular, compliance with European General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  regarding privacy and data protection, and Know Your Customer  KYC  regulations, and legal aspects of smart contracts   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  81  Fig. 7 Example of DAG-based ledger  raise several legal issues for blockchain-based IoT applications. The existing legal frameworks need to be elaborated to address these issues.  Privacy and data protection: According to GDPR, individuals have the “right to be forgotten”. However, by design, blockchains are immutable and it is very hard to modify or delete any data recorded on the blockchains. Data gathered by IoT devices include privacy-sensitive information, which is required for personalized services. By using a blockchain-based platform for IoT applications, the privacy-sensitive information is recorded on an immutable ledger, which is shared among blockchain participants. Distributed nature of the ledger and the distributed consensus mecha- nism make it very challenging to delete records from the blockchain, which raises concerns in terms of compliance with GDPR. To tackle this compliance problem, mechanisms allowing modiﬁcation of records on blockchains have been proposed in [47, 48].  Money laundering and illegal transactions: Money laundering and ﬁnancing of illegal activities are major problems faced by banks and ﬁntech companies. To ﬁght against money laundering and ﬁnancing of illegal activities, ﬁnancial institu- tions implement KYC processes in their traditional operations. With the emergence of blockchain-based transactions, knowing the identities of customers becomes a more serious problem. Public blockchains like Bitcoin blockchain allow anyone to participate in and have transactions on the blockchain keeping their identities anony- mous. This created an ideal platform for money laundering and illegal transfers in the early days of public blockchains. To comply with laws and regulations against money laundering and illegal transfers, ﬁnancial institutions are required to imple- ment KYC mechanisms on their blockchain operations. KYC on blockchain may enforce network participants to reveal their digital identities to other participants or ﬁnancial institutions in the network for identity veriﬁcation. Transactions on the blockchain network may require participants to have permissions, which may be revoked in case of suspicious activities.  Smart contracts: Another legal issue is related to the design of smart contracts, their interpretation, and legal status. Once deployed on the blockchain, smart con- tracts cannot be modiﬁed. Any coding or logic error may cause system vulnerabilities that could be exploited. There is no general judicial dispute resolution mechanism for interpreting the smart contracts, as code is the rule for smart contracts and disputes can be resolved by consensus of the network. Besides, because smart contracts are   82  V. Dedeoglu et al.  executed by computers possibly located at different jurisdictions, it is hard to identify the applicable laws and jurisdictions. Legal opinions on the enforceability of smart contracts in courts vary, and in many jurisdictions, they are not legally enforceable.  4.5 Immutable Versus Mutable Chains  One of the main properties in Bitcoin blockchain is its capability to allow adding new blocks containing new transactions in a public and shared ledger, keeping the data integrity. In other words, once a new block is mined and new transactions are added to the blockchain, it is very hard to make any changes.  The immutability property is present in most current blockchains. It is underpinned by hash functions that for input data of any size generates an output with ﬁxed data size. This is a one-way function which means that given an input, it is easy to calculate the output. However, it is very hard to ﬁnd inputs that satisfy a given output.  The Bitcoin block deﬁnition structures the transactions using Merkle Trees. The Merkle Tree follows a tree structure with transaction hashes placed at the leaves of the tree. In Fig. 8, the transaction hashes hash Tx0 , hash Tx1 , hash Tx2 , and hash Txn  are placed at the leaves of the Merkle Tree. In the next step, the algorithm calculates hash 01  from hash Tx0  and hash Tx1 , and hash 2n  from hash Tx2  and hash Txn . The algorithm keeps calculating hashes until the root hash hash 012n  is calculated from hash 01  and hash 2n . The root hash is also called the Merkle Tree root. This data structure ensures that all information produced are related and keeps its integrity.  Once the transactions are structured in a Merkle Tree and its root is calculated, this value is stored in the block header. In order to create the link between the blocks, its hash should be computed, and this hash value is stored also in the next block creating the chain or list data structure.  The Bitcoin data structure was initially deﬁned by Nakamoto [1], and it ensures that once a block is created, no changes are allowed in the block or its transactions.  Fig. 8 Merkle tree structure  Merkle Tree Root Hash  hash  012n   hash  01   hash  2n   hash  Tx0   hash  Tx1   hash  Tx2   hash  Txn    Blockchain Technologies for IoT  83  Thus, data immutability and integrity are ensured through this data organization  Fig. 9 .  Despite the advantages of data immutability, there are some related open issues. As an example, data immutability could be an issue when some illegal or inaccurate data is stored in a public ledger or when data needs to be deleted from the blockchain due to some legal requirements. Based on that, some researchers have been searching for alternatives that still present blockchain auditability while having more ﬂexibility in changing the data on the blockchain. Thus, a different data structure is presented in [19, 24], where each block is made of two parts: the block header and the payload as shown in Fig. 10. The block header is responsible for keeping the immutable piece of information, and it is used to create the link between the blocks. Whereas the payload stores the transactions in a way that each transaction is dependent on the previous transaction, and this dependency is achieved by including the previous transaction’s hash value in the next transaction. Thus, this data structure supports appending information to a block.  Fig. 9 Traditional blockchain structure  Fig. 10 Appendable blockchain structure  Traditional Blockchain  ...

HashTx SignData   84  V. Dedeoglu et al.  Another proposal to address the storage and privacy implications of blockchain immutability is the Memory Optimized and Flexible BC  MOF-BC  [47] that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or summarize their transactions and age their data and thus exercise their “right to be forgotten”. To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for different transactions. However, to facilitate removal of the stored transactions in the future, all keys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage. MOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Veriﬁer  GV  which is a signed hash of a Generator Veriﬁer Secret  GVS . The GV changes for each transaction to provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the information that needs to be stored. A ﬂexible transaction fee model and a reward mechanism are proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing memory consumption. MOF-BC is proposed as a generalized solution, which can be implemented on top of any existing or future blockchain instantiation.  4.6 Interoperability  Currently, blockchain ecosystem is highly fragmented with blockchain systems having their own mechanisms and protocols that are not interoperable with other blockchain systems. As discussed in the previous sections, different blockchain systems are designed for solving speciﬁc problems for applications with different requirements and constraints, and there is no single blockchain system that can be used for every application. Recognizing the necessity for multiple blockchain sys- tems, we need to make sure that different blockchain systems can work in harmony for realizing the full beneﬁts of blockchain technology.  Interoperability is a vital building block for multichain architectures, which will enable blockchains to communicate and cooperate with each other. Interoperability will not only allow transfer of values and digital assets but also will enable transfer of information and cross-chain contracts between different blockchain systems. For example, in a smart city application, there may be many systems working on differ- ent blockchain platforms. Interoperability will enable these blockchain platforms to work together for increased efﬁciency, improved privacy and security, and seamless automation between processes.  There has been a growing interest in multichain interoperability which will help the wide adoption of blockchain-based technologies. Current approaches for achiev- ing interoperability focuses on using validators between different blockchain systems and designing blockchains that use blocks from other blockchain systems as part of their mining mechanisms as shown in Fig. 11. Speciﬁc examples to support inter- operability among blockchains include the inter-ledger protocol, which is an open standard for inter-ledger token exchange, and Cosmos, that provides a central hub for coordination among multiple disparate blockchains.

To analyze the limits of trust established by blockchain technology, we can distinguish two sep- arate ways that blockchains operate. A blockchain record may correspond to the true state of the reality, or the record may be a view of the reality. For example, a Bitcoin transaction on Bitcoin blockchain corresponds to the true state of the reality once veriﬁed by the blockchain. The generation and transfer of the Bitcoins can be veriﬁed mathematically by following the blockchain protocol and there is a single view of the state as a result of the consensus. In this case, all the information is created on the blockchain and there is no need to trust the nodes individually. In the second case, blockchain record may represent a view of the reality. An example would be recording a sensor measurement on the blockchain. The blockchain ensures that the measurement is recorded in an immutable way. In other words, we can trust that the sensor measurement record is not tampered. However, the record provides no guarantees for the correctness of the measurement. The information is not created on the blockchain, and hence there is no way to prove the correctness of it by simply examining the blockchain records. This represents the following fundamental prob- lem: What is the value of establishing trust in a record of data, when the data itself is not trusted?  It is evident that this fundamental problem arises in many blockchain-based IoT applications as IoT applications heavily depend on sensing and observations. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in the development of trust manage- ment and reputation systems. In [49], Yan et al. investigated the objectives for IoT trust management and provided a survey of current IoT trust management mechanisms. Decentralization of IoT applications through blockchain-based technologies elim- inates central authorities and trusted third parties. The lack of central authorities and   86  V. Dedeoglu et al.  trusted third parties demand decentralized trust management and reputation mech- anisms developed for the blockchain-based IoT applications. As discussed in the previous sections, blockchain-based technologies can be used for a diverse range of IoT applications. These IoT applications have different structures in terms of network topologies, rules of participation and management, type of transactions and commu- nications between participants, and system requirements and constraints. Due to this diversity, current approaches for trust management and reputation mechanisms are application speciﬁc.  In vehicular applications, trust mechanisms can incorporate information from various sources such as neighboring vehicles, roadside units, and witnesses to eval- uate the trustworthiness of information and reputation of network participants. The reputation levels of participants can be stored on distributed ledgers in a privacy- preserving way. Lu et al. proposed the Blockchain-based Anonymous Reputation System  BARS  to build a trust model for vehicular ad hoc networks while pre- serving privacy of the network participants in [50]. Their reputation system uses direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about vehicles to score the trust- worthiness of messages. The recorded direct and indirect evidence on blockchain is used to evaluate the reputation of each vehicle. In [36], a partitioned BlockChain based Framework for Auto-insurance Claims and Adjudication  B-FICA  for con- nected and automated vehicles was proposed with a dynamic veriﬁcation protocol for preventing potential liable entities from altering evidence. Kang et al. proposed a reputation-based data-sharing scheme for high-quality data sharing in vehicular net- works using a consortium blockchain and smart contracts [51]. Their subjective logic model considers interaction frequency, event timeliness, and trajectory similarity for reputation management.  In supply chain applications, BC provides a tamper-proof ledger of events and sensor measurements. The data provided by supply chain participants and sensor devices, however, should be assessed for credibility before being merged to the supply chain blockchain. This assessment may incorporate multiple sensor observations, and manual inspections and checks for veriﬁcation of the data provided by sensor devices and supply chain participants. For example, the measurements of neighboring sensor devices or the history of measurements can be used to validate a sensor measurement. Similarly, an asset to be transferred between a supplier and a buyer can be manually inspected by the buyer at the point of transfer for quality veriﬁcation. The result of the assessment can be used to evaluate the reputation of supply chain participants [52] and to detect faulty or malicious sensor devices.  Another approach for improving trust in the data for blockchain-based IoT appli- cations is to design systems with built-in mechanisms against tampering sensor devices and tampering sensor data during transmission process. To guarantee the trustworthiness and reliability of data at the source, Waltonchain proposes a com- plete blockchain-based IoT ecosystem in [53]. Their RFID-based sensor platform is speciﬁcally designed for supporting blockchain applications and ensuring data reliability at the source.   Blockchain Technologies for IoT  5 Conclusions  87  Blockchain technology has proved itself as a useful platform for distributed consen- sus and cryptocurrency transactions. Furthermore, its potential for next-generation decentralized networks and applications are clear although the technology may not be mature enough for mass adoption yet. Still at early days of development, pilot trials, and demos, blockchain-based technologies promise a new form of trust, decen- tralized communications and control, transparency, traceability, reliability, improved security, and new business models for IoT applications.  In this chapter, we have described potential beneﬁts and challenges of using blockchain technology for IoT applications and provided some use case exam- ples. Blockchain-based IoT applications incorporate security, distributed systems, networks, software engineering, databases, cloud computing, ﬁnancial engineer- ing, network economics, and IoT technologies and offer a wide range of interest- ing research directions including mathematical modeling of blockchains and dif- ferent consensus mechanisms, ways to improve scalability and performance, new blockchain architectures, new application areas, and artiﬁcial-intelligence-enabled smart contracts.

From the technological point of view, the blockchain is still far from a mainstream adoption, mainly due to scalability issues and because the interaction with it is still complex and requires technical skills. Given blockchain’s  and smart contracts’  advantages and technical limitations, it is difﬁcult, for a company, to decide whether to invest in this technology or not, and to identify potential successful use cases. The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with practical information to perform this choice. In particular, the chapter ﬁrst provides a glossary of blockchain-related terms and then shows existing and under development use cases belonging to different sectors. Presented use cases are then discussed, to identify which sectors could beneﬁt the most from blockchain and smart contracts, highlighting the most promising use cases in which this technology could be disrupting, and underlying the ones where advantages of relying on it are only marginal.

The media frequently advertised it as a breakthrough technology and referred to it as “The next big thing” [6], “The new black”, “The philosopher’s stone” [103], or “The new Graal” [33].  The reasons of the success of blockchain are that it is a shared, worldwide, ledger  recording transactions executed among nodes, in the form of messages sent from one node to another [119] , stored on and maintained by network nodes on a peer-to- peer basis. Everyone can inspect it, and information stored on it cannot be modiﬁed or erased. Blockchain technology was initially conceived for transferring money without the need to rely on intermediaries. Nonetheless, recently, a high number of researchers and developers envisaged more complex scenarios and started to use it in combination with smart contracts, self-executing pieces of code stored on the blockchain, which could act autonomously in case a given condition occurs [120]. By combining blockchain and smart contract, existing processes could be automatized, thus improving their efﬁciency and reducing costs.  Despite the huge advantages blockchain and smart contracts promise to bring to different scenarios and applications, it must be said that this technology is still far from a mainstream adoption. In fact, at the present time, scalability is a big issue, as the blockchain is able to process a limited amount of transactions per seconds. Another relevant issue is usability, as reading and writing information on the blockchain requires some technical skills.  In such a context, for a company, it is difﬁcult to evaluate whether investing in blockchain technology could be a wise strategic choice  as well as to identify the most promising use cases for its sector . The advantages could be numerous, e.g., production processes could be automated and made transparent to the customer, which could trace the history of a good; bureaucracy could be simpliﬁed, using the blockchain to record public documents; smart contracts could be used to trigger automatic reimbursements to customers, etc. The disadvantages are related to the fact that only few use cases already exist, where blockchain has been successfully used to streamline traditional processes. Furthermore, some people argue that blockchain and smart contracts are only a fad, are overhyped [50], or that the same results could be achieved using well-mastered alternatives [91].  The objective of this chapter is to provide the reader with some clarity on the main advantages and disadvantages of relying on blockchain and smart contracts for existing or new processes and services, and to provide an overview of existing or envisaged blockchain- and smart contract-based use cases. In particular, the chapter aims at:  cid:129  providing a basic glossary of blockchain-related concepts;  cid:129  presenting what are the potential use cases of blockchain and smart contracts, developed in several sectors, ranging from ﬁnance and insurance to industry, government, and others;  cid:129  discussing which use cases could beneﬁt the most from blockchain and smart contracts, and which others could be successfully implemented with traditional technologies.   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  93  The rest of the chapter is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a basic glossary of blockchain-related terms  which have been widely discussed in the other chapters of this book . Section 3 presents a list of proposed envisioned developed use cases belonging to different sectors. Section 4 reports a discussion on which use cases need to rely on a blockchain, and which other could be realized with traditional systems. Finally, conclusions are reported in Sect. 5.  2 Blockchain Glossary  The blockchain  literally, a “chain of blocks”  was initially conceived to transfer payments from one party to another without the need to rely on intermediaries. It was devised as the key enabling technology of the Bitcoin initiative [71, 86], where it acted as the underlying ledger recording Bitcoin transfers and guaranteeing, by exploiting cryptography, the authentication, and non-repudiation of payments. Since the birth of Bitcoin, more than 2000 cryptocurrencies have been created [21], which are generally aimed to be used as exchange tokens in many different blockchain- based applications.  In the following, some key concepts related to the blockchain ecosystem are reported. A thorough explanation of the functioning, the features, and the different types of blockchain frameworks is reported in the preceding chapters of the present book.  cid:129  Transactions: cryptocurrency transfers from one party to another are represented as transaction from A to B. It is worth remarking that cryptocurrencies are neither physical nor software objects; instead, they are the result of incoming and outgoing transactions related to an address;  cid:129  Blocks: transactions are grouped in blocks, which are periodically added to the blockchain. Each block collects all the transactions made in a given timeframe. Blocks are sequentially ordered, by linking each new block to the preceding one;  cid:129  Hash: in cryptography, a hash is an alpha-numeric summary of data. It is computed by applying a mathematical function to some input data, to produce an output of a ﬁxed size;  cid:129  Nodes: differently from centralized databases, the blockchain is spread over net- work computers. Such computers are generally referred to as the “nodes” of the network. Depending on the type, nodes can contain a local copy of the blockchain  thus creating redundant copies of it  or portions of it;  cid:129  Majority consensus: the blockchain is generally maintained by network nodes, without a central authority  even though some blockchain frameworks could fore- see a certain amount of centralization . In order to avoid the control made by a central authority, the decisions on the network are taken according to a majority consensus. In this view, only if the majority of nodes agrees on a new block, the block is added to the blockchain;   94  V. Gatteschi et al.   cid:129  Mining: as previously mentioned, depending on their type, nodes could store a portion, or all the history of previous transactions occurred on the blockchain. Furthermore, nodes could also decide to whether passively store a copy of the blockchain, or actively take part to its maintenance  in some cases, they receive a monetary reward compensation for this task . The maintenance of the blockchain is the so-called “mining” process. During the mining process, nodes verify if a person is entitled to spend a given amount of cryptocurrency and add new blocks to the chain. Depending on the mechanism chosen to add blocks, nodes could compete with the other nodes to solve a complex computational-intensive mathe- matical problem  designed to limit the possibility for malicious entities to falsify transactions ;  cid:129  Wallet: in order to transfer cryptocurrency, people rely on wallets. As previously mentioned, cryptocurrencies are not objects; instead, they are the result of previous transactions related to an address. In order to trigger a transaction, the user has to input his her credentials  i.e., his her private key . A wallet could be used to store those credentials, to “sign” the transaction  i.e., certifying its immutability and that the transaction has been sent by a given address  and to broadcast the transaction on the blockchain network. Each wallet is associated with one  or more  unique addresses. In case of loss of credentials, the cryptocurrencies owned by a user would not “disappear” from the blockchain; instead, the user would no more be able to transfer them to other addresses;  cid:129  Smart contracts: they are small programs, stored on the blockchain, which could behave in an autonomous way if some conditions are met. They are a powerful tool enabling a variety of new applications. In fact, once a smart contract is stored on the blockchain, its code cannot be changed and could be inspected by everyone  even though some programming skills would still be required to understand it . In case some situations occur, they could automatically trigger cryptocurrency transfers;  cid:129  Oracles: they are external services, which take data from the “real” world and inject them into the blockchain  or vice versa .  3 Use Cases Based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts  A high number of applications have been proposed over the years, which exploit blockchain and smart contracts in a variety of different scenarios and sectors.  Apart from ﬁnancial applications, which mainly rely on the blockchain to enable decentralized monetary transfers, other types of applications exploit the blockchain to record different types of information, such as public data  e.g., vehicle registries , semi-public data  e.g., education degrees , or private records  e.g., wills . Other types of applications propose to rely on blockchain technology to record intangible assets  e.g., coupons , or tangible ones  e.g., electronic hotel room keys  [16].  This section presents an overview of developed or envisaged applications based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. Applications are grouped according   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  95  to their sector and context. The aim of the overview is to let the reader have a clear picture of the different applications that have been  or could be  realized by leveraging blockchain, as well as to understand the current state of this technology and its impact on the society.  3.1 Blockchain for Finance  As previously mentioned, ﬁnancial applications were the ﬁrst ones envisioned, when the blockchain was created. Apart from Bitcoin, which was the ﬁrst example of blockchain developed for making monetary transfers among parties, other blockchains have been devised. In particular, they were created to overcome some limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain, the most relevant one being the average time of 10 min required to create a new block.  This is the case, for example, of Litecoin Web Page [72], which, when devised, was able to produce new blocks every 2.5 min. Another famous alternative is Ripple, which was developed by a private company and is especially targeted to the bank sector, guaranteeing a transactions time of few seconds [58].  Bitcoin and, in general, other cryptocurrencies, can be exchanged with FIAT currencies or with other cryptocurrencies  or tokens  using online exchanges. Such platforms generally host user’s credentials  i.e., the private key to transfer cryptocur- rencies  and are frequently the target of hackers’ attacks. Even though, for beginners, letting the third entity manage the private key could be an easier choice, it must be underlined that this choice is not the preferred one, as the online exchange would have full control on users’ funds. Hence, several decentralized online exchanges have been devised. The ﬁrst example is EtherDelta Web Page [34] which is entirely based on smart contracts, ruling the exchange among cryptocurrencies. In the EtherDelta’s view, cryptocurrencies are stored on  managed by  a smart contract, which exchanges them for other tokens. Another example is represented by ShapeShift Web Page [110]. Using this service, in order to exchange cryptocurrencies with other tokens, users can send from their wallet cryptocurrency to a given address and receive the desired token to another address they own.  A current drawback of cryptocurrencies, which limited their adoption by the wider public, is their volatility. At this purpose, it must be worth mentioning that a number of stable coins have been created or are under development, which are pegged to FIAT currencies or precious metals. The most famous is probably Tether Web Page [122], a token that, when issued, is backed by “real” dollars, held in a reserve. Being 1 Tether equal to 1$, Tether is subject to extremely small ﬂuctuations with respect to other tokens. Using stable coins, people can transfer FIAT-like tokens, by maintaining, at the same time, the decentralization and traceability features provided by the blockchain.  In a wider scenario, still related to monetary earnings, smart contracts are generally used also in online lotteries [35, 66] or pyramid-like rewarding systems. In this view, they provide users the guarantee that the selection of the winner or the transfer of   96  V. Gatteschi et al.  rewards are completely decentralized and transparent  as the users could inspect the smart contracts .  In a similar way, also betting platforms started to exploit smart contracts to provide a more transparent and cheap betting environment [38]. These platforms generally rely also on oracles to retrieve from the real world the result of a match and inject it into the blockchain.  Another application, which is related to the ﬁnancial sector, is prediction markets such as Augur or Gnosis [5, 48]. Such markets adopt the “Wisdom of the Crowd” assumption, which states that predictions made by groups of people are more likely to happen than to those made by a single individual. Using these platforms, users can make a guess about the occurrence of a future event  e.g., the result of the elections . In case their guess is correct, the smart contracts exploited by the platform would automatically transfer them a reward. Similarly to betting platforms, prediction markets strongly rely on oracles. At this purpose, it must be underlined that a good design choice is to exploit several oracles, gathering the information from multiple different sources, rather than relying on just one oracle, in order to prevent damages due to attacks or bugs in the oracle or in the source of information. In this way, the smart contract would trigger a monetary transfer only if the majority of the oracles conﬁrm the occurrence of the event.  It must also be worth mentioning also smart contract-based pension funds [8]. With these pension funds, working citizens could regularly send money  cryptocurrencies  to a smart contract, which would manage their funds and, when the time comes, regularly transfer retirement funds. Depending on the features of the smart contract, it could also automatically produce forecasts on the expected future monthly beneﬁts, based on the already provided contribution.  Finally, smart contracts have been also used to enable money lending among individuals, without the need of relying on a bank. Several solutions have been proposed, which distribute the risks among the actors lending money [70, 133]. Other solutions, in order to mitigate such risk, are based on collaterals  generally other tokens , which are sold in case the money is not reimbursed to the lenders [36, 109].  3.2 Blockchain for Notary Services  Another application ﬁeld, which was among the ﬁrst ones to be considered, is related to notary services. In the notarial context, several applications have been proposed, which exploit the anti-tampering characteristics of the blockchain, as well as its public availability.  The ﬁrst example is represented by approaches targeted to intellectual property rights protection. Here, the blockchain is used to prove the existence of a document at a given time [96]. Platforms exploiting the blockchain generally stored on the shared ledger the hash of a document together with a timestamp. In this way, the author can prove that he or she created the document and that the document existed at a given time.   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  97  Whereas, in this case, the blockchain is only used to certify the existence of a ﬁle, other solutions have a more ambitious objective. In fact, they exploit smart contracts to enable automatic licensing of content [4, 82, 127]. In particular, each time a person uses a content developed by someone else  an image or a music ﬁle, in the particular cases , a token transfer is made to the author.  More sophisticated solutions aim at exploiting blockchain and smart contracts to reduce the workload of notaries and let people automatically deﬁne agreements among parties.  In this view, smart contracts could be used to encode a person’s last will [115]. Here, the person should make a token transfer to the smart contract, which will manage the tokens until the person’s departure. An oracle  or a set of oracles, for increased security  would then be used to retrieve data from death certiﬁcates. In case of death of the testator, the smart contract would transfer the funds to the beneﬁciary’s address. At this purpose, it must be underlined that the smart contract could eventually encode additional conditions for the transfer  such as the graduation of the beneﬁciary, or a given study average .  Other researchers proposed to exploit the blockchain to record public records such as marriage certiﬁcates [14]. While, in this case, the blockchain is only used as a public ledger, other solutions envisage the exploitation of smart contracts to declare the willingness to get married [32, 124], or even to rule the management of the just created family’s ﬁnances [131]. In the ﬁrst case, both parties involved in the marriage have to send a transaction to a smart contract, in order to certify their willingness to get married. In the second case, the smart contract takes actively part in the life of the couple and could be even used in case of divorce, to automatically split accumulated funds, based on the rules speciﬁed at its creation.  The blockchain can also be exploited to store other types of contracts, such as property rentals and exchanges. At this purpose, some studies [26] demonstrated the advantages deriving from the exploitation of smart contracts in a real estate context, in particular, having a unique shared ledger helps in reducing information fragmentation  as usually for rent sale houses are advertised on a variety of different websites . Furthermore, the previous history of parties involved in an agreement could be easily veriﬁed, provided that they exploit a unique address to undersign agreements and to perform payments. The sell lease agreement could be represented by a smart contract, which would manage, for example, the deposit. The exploitation of smart contracts for property transfers demonstrated to be able to reduce the lead time from the signature of the sale contract to the registration of the ownership of the property from 4 months to 2 days [8].  It must be underlined, though, that not all the existing traditional legal contracts could be converted in smart contracts rules, as legal contracts usually leave room for interpretation in case of dispute and voluntarily adopt ambiguous language that could be hardly coded in binary terms [39, 40, 81]. A solution to this limitation is provided by Jur [60]. This service lets people create smart contracts using simpliﬁed wizards and foresees a dispute resolution mechanism where other users can vote for one party or another.   98  V. Gatteschi et al.  3.3 Blockchain for the Management of Personal Data  The third family of applications exploits the non-repudiability features of the blockchain to certify the identity of a person. The idea is easy to grasp and con- sists of linking to a user’s wallet address several information related to a person’s identity, interests, or credentials. In this view, when the user signs a transaction using his or her private key, he she can prove the ownership of the address, and hence can prove his her identity.  Exploiting a blockchain-based proof of identity means that there is no more the need to rely on a central authority, to prove one’s identity. The advantage, in this case, is that the individual would have full control of his her private data, as he she could decide with whom share them [69]. Furthermore, private data would no more be stored on centralized databases, which could be vulnerable to attacks or modiﬁ- cations.  BitID is one of the ﬁrst prototypes of this kind [11], letting users log into some websites using their Bitcoin wallet. In order to get veriﬁed, users have to scan a QR code displayed on the BitID website with their wallet’s mobile app, and subsequently sign a message with their credentials.  Another application ﬁeld, which is recently receiving a growing attention, is KYC—Know Your Customer. KYC is the process of identifying the identity of a client during those traditionally bureaucratic tasks such as opening a bank account or undersigning an insurance policy. Several services already exist, which provide a blockchain-based KYC [20, 31, 63, 69]. Using such services, each person is provided with a unique address. The ﬁrst time the person uses the service, his her identity is veriﬁed by a certiﬁed inspector  which physically checks the ID card . Then, each time the person has to perform a given operation requiring the veriﬁcation of his her identity, he she would only need to sign a transaction with his her credentials, in order to be veriﬁed.  Finally, it is worth mentioning that other applications take a step forward with respect to the ones described above, and mix on- and off-chain data with the aim of fostering the protection of user’s personal data [137]. Using such applications, users can grant the access to their private data as follows: they ﬁrst would need to prove their identity on the blockchain; then, once the veriﬁcation has been successful, they could grant the access to personal data linked to their address, which are stored off-chain and encrypted.  3.4 Blockchain for Insurance  Insurance is another ﬁeld which could widely proﬁt from blockchain technology [44, 45]. In fact, similarly to ﬁnance, insurance is a sector widely characterized by intermediaries, which guarantee that the involved parties behave as expected. The   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  99  blockchain could provide similar guarantees currently ensured by intermediaries, at lower costs.  The ﬁrst beneﬁt arising from the exploitation of blockchain and smart contracts in conjunction with IoT  Internet of Things  sensors is the improvement of customers’ experience and the reduction of operating costs. This type of applications relies on smart contracts to encode the rules for damage reimbursement. Then, each time an oracle detects the occurrence of a given situation, the reimbursement could be automatically triggered, even before the customer experience the damage. Several use cases have been devised, which range from the identiﬁcation of damp under the roof [24] to ﬂight delays [10]. Concerning this last use case, it is worth mentioning that some practical  working  implementations already exist, targeted to the wider public [41].  Another use case is data entry identity veriﬁcation. As previously anticipated, each time customers undersign a new policy, they could verify their identity by signing a transaction with their private key, thus reducing the time and bureaucratic procedures linked to manual veriﬁcation.  The fact that the blockchain could be written and inspected by multiple parties lays the foundations for the third use case, which is related to frauds prevention. In fact, multiple parties, such as insurance staff, police ofﬁcers, medical staff, etc., could write on the blockchain all the relevant events related to a person. In this view, the insurance company, before reimbursing a claim or acquiring a new customer, could check the history of previous claims and infractions of the customer. A further application could rely also on smart contracts for an automatic  and more precise  computation of the customer’s risk and the related premium.  Pay-per-use insurances could be also realized using blockchain and smart con- tracts. In fact, by sending transactions on the blockchain, customers could acti- vate deactivate  vehicle  covers without needing to sign  and send back to the com- pany  documents. The blockchain would keep trace of the state of a cover at a given time. A smart contract would then be used to trigger reimbursements, in case the cover was active during an event. Furthermore, by leveraging on sensors, covers could be even automatically activated deactivated, each time a vehicle leaves a selected area, or based on weather forecasts [65].  Finally, the last use case which could beneﬁt from blockchain and smart contracts is peer-to-peer insurance. Existing peer-to-peer insurances need a given amount of central control [15, 51, 62]. With smart contracts, the rules to manage Decentralized Autonomous Organizations  DAOs , such as individuals grouping together to share the insurance risk, could be hard-coded [25].  3.5 Blockchain in the Industrial Sector  During the recent years, industry as well started to recognize the advantages of blockchain technology. Several use cases were investigated, and some prototypal solutions were developed. The advantages of industry are numerous. For example,   100  V. Gatteschi et al.  production and supply chain could exploit the fact that the blockchain is an unmodiﬁ- able shared ledger, shared among multiple organizations. Using blockchain, different actors involved in the production of a good, or in its supply chain, could simulta- neously write on the blockchain relevant information related to the good, or inspect what has been written by the other actors. In this view, the information would no more be fragmented on multiple databases. Furthermore, the blockchain would keep track of who inserted the information, as well as of the exact instant in which this opera- tion was performed. Consequently, it becomes possible to know, at each instant, the current state of a good  as well as all the previous states . In addition, each involved party would have a guarantee that data have not been tampered [8, 57]. Some solu- tions propose to exploit blockchain also for tracking the authorship of documents  e.g., for managing construction logbooks [125] . Whereas in some sectors track- ing information about goods would not be vital, other sectors, such as the aviation industry, could tremendously beneﬁt from blockchain, as each plane’s component has to be carefully tracked, requiring a high amount of paperwork, in “traditional” approaches [77].  Another use case, which has been widely investigated, is related to the exploitation of the blockchain to detect counterfeit items. In this view, information on valuable goods  and on their ownership  is written in the blockchain. In each instant, a customer could check data on his her good, as well as the history of previous owners. The most famous example is probably represented by Everledger, a company which proposed to use the blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds [37]. In the Everledger’s view, diamonds’ key distinguishing characteristics are recorded on the blockchain, together with all the operations performed on them  cut, polishing, etc. . Other goods which have been tracked using the blockchain are sport music tickets, electronics goods [13], drugs [13, 77, 123], cars [105], timber [30], and foods [100].  Smart contracts have also been exploited in this context, especially to rule refunds among parties. To mention an example, it has been proposed to exploit a smart contract to manage the interaction between seller and buyers, in a pizza delivery scenario [17]. In this scenario, the smart contract encodes the rules for pizza delivery. In case of late delivery, the smart contract would automatically transfer back to the buyer half of the price of the pizza. In other scenarios, smart contracts have been used to automatically assign loyalty points  which could then be exchanged for other goods , based on money spent in shops and restaurants [74]. In another context, blockchain and smart contracts have been used in decentralized e-commerce applications [83], to compute the reputation of the parties involved on a trade  e.g., based on data related to their previous trades and evaluations . A more ambitious solution is presented by Prophet Web Page [99], which proposes to exploit smart contracts together with Artiﬁcial Intelligence to support a demand-driven economy and the match of goods demands and offers. With a similar objective in mind, Arxum [3] proposes to exploit smart contracts during the production of components  e.g., with additive manufacturing or other manufacturing processes . Here, the blockchain is used to track the production delivery status, whereas smart contracts distribute the proﬁts made by the actors machines involved in the production and delivery of the component.   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  101  Finally, it must be relevant to highlight another advantage of blockchain, which is the simpliﬁcation of audit processes. In fact, should a company record all its incoming and outgoing transactions on the blockchain, audits could be performed in a quicker and more effective way [101].  3.6 Blockchain for Automotive and Mobility  In the automotive and mobility context, several use cases exploiting blockchain have been proposed.  A ﬁrst use case is related to the manufacturing supply chain and vehicle lifecycle management. As previously mentioned, in the industrial ﬁeld, the blockchain is exploited to let multiple actors insert  and hence, provide a guarantee of  information on produced assembled goods and products [19]. The information could become even more accurate in case sensors are used to retrieve the status of each product [79]. In the automotive industry, the blockchain could be used to track the history of a vehicle  in terms of spare parts , in order to improve vehicles recalls [75, 112]. In other contexts, the blockchain is used to track the origin of other types of assets, e.g., to verify that the energy used to recharge a vehicle comes from renewable sources [114], or to check if the cobalt used during the production of batteries is legal and does not come from child labor [128, 134].  In the context of electric vehicles charging, the blockchain is generally used as the underlying infrastructure to perform payments between the vehicle and the charging station, with some prototypal solutions proposed either in literature [95, 102], either in the commercial scenario [111].  Another relevant ﬁeld is vehicle-to-everything  V2X . Use cases related to V2X usually exploit the blockchain to foster system’s security. For example, the blockchain has been exploited to enable secure over-the-air  OTA  software updates [23, 78]. Other applications exploit the blockchain to store data gathered from vehicles  e.g., that could be sold to other vehicles  [29, 117]. In this view, the blockchain provides a double advantage: ﬁrst, it guarantees the origin of the data, and second, it is used to transfer rewards to vehicles providing information, or to enable the market of data. The blockchain is also used to rule interactions among multiple vehicle’s owners. This is the case, for example, of applications enabling the fractional ownership of vehicles [121, 132]. In this view, the vehicle is “tokenized”, meaning that each owner receives a portion of tokens proportional to his her initial contribution. In this way, the ownership can be easily veriﬁed and transferred to other parties. More complex applications could foresee also the possibility to rent lease a vehicle to other people, by accepting tokens based on the vehicle’s usage [88, 108]. In this view, smart contracts are exploited to automatically distribute the revenues across the multiple owners. Such applications could even rely on intelligent locks, which could be able to unlock a vehicle only when the user paid for its usage [54, 97, 113]. Finally, it must be underlined that the above solutions could be even complemented with automatic, blockchain-based insurance policy underwriting, and covers activation [28, 65].   102  V. Gatteschi et al.  3.7 Blockchain for Healthcare, Education, and Government  Several use cases exploiting blockchain and smart contracts have been proposed in the context of government, health care, and education.  For what it concerns government, Estonia recently proposed to exploit blockchain for e-Residency, with the aim of increasing the security of identity management [118]. Other use cases rely on the blockchain to record in a transparent  and immutable  way citizen’s votes [89]  or even politician program, in order to check, on a second time, whether they kept their promises . A blockchain-based voting system could be realized as follows: each citizen with voting rights could receive a token. When he she has to express his her preferences, he she could transfer the token  by making a transaction  to a politician’s wallet address. The blockchain would guarantee the authenticity and unchangeability of the vote, and, by checking the balance of each politician’s wallet address, everyone could see in real time the distribution of votes. Furthermore, the cryptographic mechanisms underlying the blockchain would guar- antee the provenance of a vote, even though particular attention should be devoted to assign voting addresses’ private keys to citizens in a random, untraced way. More complex  and futuristic  solutions could even foresee DAO-based autonomous gov- ernance systems [56], in which citizens could suggest modiﬁcations to existing laws and vote them.  In the healthcare context, the blockchain could be exploited as a shared infras- tructure to store patient’s medical data. The advantages here are numerous: ﬁrst of all, researchers could proﬁt from the availability of a wide set of medical data, which could be used to perform studies on existing pathologies. Second, the medical history of a person as well as current treatments could be inspected by authorized actors, letting doctors act in a faster and more accurate way in case of urgency [136]. Several companies are currently proposing solutions to store patient’s data both in the medical [80] and in the dental contexts [27]. Other companies have a more ambitious goal, which exploits also smart contracts to connect patients and healthcare service providers, in order to create the most suitable  and fast  healing path for a pathology, and cutting down bureaucracy costs and inefﬁciencies typical of traditional processes [107]. Other actors propose to exploit the blockchain to control opioid prescriptions [136]. Finally, also in healthcare ﬁeld, insurance companies could exploit blockchain and smart contracts to shorten the claim processing phases and detect frauds.  For what it concerns education, several researchers proposed to use the blockchain to record competencies acquired by the learners [49, 126]. In this view, a person’s previous learning history would be stored on a unique  shared  ledger with multiple advantages. First of all, the learner could have a clear idea of his her acquired or missing competencies, and could subsequently plan the corrective actions to improve his her chances to be employed [42, 84, 85]. From the practical point of view, each learner would be provided with a wallet address, acting as a container of competencies [90]. Transactions would represent acquired competencies. Furthermore, in some cases, the hash of a certiﬁcate could also be stored on the blockchain, to guarantee the originality of the document. This solution has been already adopted by some   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  103  Universities, such as the University of Nicosia [129] or the Holberton School [55]. At this purpose, it must be underlined that a standard has also been deﬁned, which is the “Open Standard for Blockchain Certiﬁcates”, developed by the MIT Media Lab [12]. Through blockchain, job application frauds could be widely reduced, since one’s previous history could not be tampered with. Even more complex applications could be envisioned, which exploit smart contracts to evaluate the competencies acquired by the learner, in order to automatically suggest job offers [2], unblock scholarship payments, or to reward students based on their marks [1].  3.8 Blockchain for Software, Internet, and IoT  In the software context, it has been proposed to exploit the blockchain to foster security. To make some examples, some initiatives exploited it to store system logs. In this view, it would become nearly impossible, for an attacker, to delete or alter events history [106].  The blockchain has also been used to store domain names, with the aim of replac- ing Domain Name Systems  DNS  servers with a blockchain-based architecture [61, 87].  New applications propose to exploit smart contracts to reward users for rented space on their hard drives, in a cloud storage scenario [76, 116]. Here, ﬁles provided by other users are ﬁrst split and encrypted, and then stored on the rented hard disk portion provided by other users. In order to avoid multiple repetitions of the same ﬁle  e.g., of famous desktop wallpapers downloaded from internet , the hash of each ﬁle is computed before its upload, and ﬁles which have been previously stored by other users would not be uploaded again. This approach somehow mimics the one adopted by the Inter Planetary File System  IPFS , which retrieves documents on the Web based on their hash, rather than on their name. Then, in the cloud storage scenario, smart contracts would compute the rented space and automatically transfer reimbursements, thus lowering system’s costs.  Another family of use cases is related to IoT. In this ﬁeld  as better described in the other chapters of this book , blockchain and smart contracts could be exploited to provide a secure and automatic interaction among devices [18, 22]. To mention few examples, the blockchain could be used for the secure authentication of IoT devices, or for secure software updates [23, 78]. More ambitious applications exploit also smart contracts and oracles to enable the automatic interaction among intelli- gent appliances and the real world [53]. This is the case, for example, of intelligent washing machines, which could monitor the state of their components, and eventu- ally order  and pay for  replacements, in case of damage. An even more complex use case is one of the smart grids, in which smart contracts could be used to enable automatic energy trades between nearby buildings [73], managing the interactions among energy buyers and sellers.   104  V. Gatteschi et al.  3.9 Blockchain for the Sharing Economy  During recent years, several applications have been proposed, which aim at replacing existing well-known sharing economy services such as Airbnb or Uber, with blockchain-based ones. The main advantage of these solutions is that they man- age, in a decentralized way, the interactions among platform’s users. Consequently, by removing the intermediaries, end users can beneﬁt from lower costs or higher rewards. Example of these applications is BeeToken Web Page [9], which aims at being the decentralized version of Airbnb, La’Zooz Web Page [64], which could be seen as a decentralized service for ride sharing, and Gems Web Page [47], which is the decentralized competitor of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Decentralized homestay couch sharing could also beneﬁt from intelligent lockers, which could automatically enable the access to a house only to veriﬁed guests [113].  Another advantage of smart contracts is that they could enable the creation of DAOs, which are the backbone of the sharing economy. In the DAOs’ view, groups of individuals cooperate with each other according to hard-coded rules. An example is presented by Pazaitis et al., in which individuals provide valuable tangible and intangible assets to the community, which could decide the mechanisms to evaluate the provided assets, and thus, rewarding the creator provider [92].  3.10 The Social Impact of Blockchain  A global adoption of blockchain could have social repercussion, as it could enable the access to several services also to people leaving in emerging countries. The ﬁrst advantage developing countries could have is money exchanges. In fact, unbanked people could easily create a wallet address and receive send money. Furthermore, as transactions are generally performed at a lower cost, people could trigger micropay- ments and make more affordable money transfers [123].  Other initiatives proposed to exploit the blockchain to enable migrants’ identiﬁ-  cation [7, 98, 130], as previously explained in Sect. 3.3.  Finally, another interesting application is the tracking of donations. Using the blockchain, donor’s funds’ usage could be inspected at each time, thus guaranteeing that the money reached the intended beneﬁciary [52, 123].  4 Which Use Cases Would Beneﬁt the Most  from Blockchain and Smart Contracts?  From the overview provided in Sect. 3, it emerges that use cases in which blockchain technology has been already exploited or could be adopted are various and embrace several sectors and application scenarios. Despite the long list of initiatives described   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  105  above, it must be said that some studies estimated that blockchain-based applications will be fully available to the wider public only in 10–15 years [33]. Furthermore, several experts pointed out that in some cases a blockchain would not be needed, as in the case of Gideon Greenspan, the CEO of Coin Sciences, who stated “If you don’t mind putting someone in charge of a database, then there’s no point using a blockchain” [94]. Other researchers claim that in some cases blockchain enthusiasts focus only on advantages of this technology, by omitting risks, as they fear to slow down the innovation [68]. Others argue that blockchain technology has a dark side, especially due to the fact that autonomous smart contracts could behave unexpect- edly and could not be subject to the control of a court [93]. Considered the above considerations, and considered the investment costs, it is not surprising that compa- nies are sometimes cautious, when it comes to decide whether to invest or not in this technology.  Among the use cases described above, though, there are some of them that could receive wide beneﬁts from blockchain. Others, instead, could more easily be realized with existing technology. In some cases, the initial investments are expected to be low, whereas other would require a substantial investment.  Probably, should companies want to adopt blockchain, the easiest step could be to start accepting cryptocurrencies transfers. In fact, this use case is one of the easiest to realize, as cryptocurrencies transfers exist since 10 years; hence, best practices are already available. Several wallets are available for the wider public [59], and people can easily convert FIAT currency in cryptocurrency, even by paying with credit card. Accepting cryptocurrencies transfers could ﬁrst attract technology enthusiasts  or those who already are familiar with blockchain technology , but, as cryptocurrencies diffusion will grow, this fact could give a competitive advantage. The only drawback is related to the fact that, in order to transfer cryptocurrencies and interact with the blockchain, the end user needs some training, especially related to security topics, such as the correct storage of his her private key, to the identiﬁcation of phishing attacks  which are quite frequent in the blockchain scenario , and to the processes to issue a transaction. At this purpose, it must be underlined that in some cases the wider public would mistrust cryptocurrencies due to their high volatility. This drawback could be partially limited by the advent of stablecoins, which could open the possibility also to cautious end users to adopt cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency transfer is probably the clearest use case in which relying on blockchain is vital. In fact, even though money transfers are actually performed by central banks, which exploit traditional databases, here the blockchain is the key enabling technology to remove intermediaries.  Another use case, which could be easily realized, is KYC. In fact, companies could rely on external services which perform this task. The companies which could be interested in adopting blockchain-based KYC are not only banks and insurance companies  even though those two are the ones that perform the highest bureaucratic work , but all the ones that could need to verify a customer’s identity on the ﬂy. Even- tually, also websites could adopt blockchain-based logins. At this purpose, though, it must be underlined that, again, the end user should have some basic knowledge related to the protection of his her private key. As mentioned in Sect. 3, probably the   106  V. Gatteschi et al.  management of personal data is one of the use cases which will be fully developed in the future  and used on a worldwide basis , as the social repercussions are high, espe- cially for migrants. In order to be realized, this use case requires a deﬁnition of best practices to store personal information as well as an agreement among governments around the globe. Similarly to the ﬁrst use case, for this use case, the blockchain could play a key role, as it would be a sovereign ledger where users’ veriﬁcation is performed, thanks to cryptography. Even though solutions relying on traditional systems could be realized, it must be said that they should be managed by the third, neutral institution.  The protection of property rights and the proof of existence is another use case which could be easily realized, as a number of applications already exist to write on the blockchain the hash of a document. Also for this use case, a worldwide agreement on the shared ledger that could be used to certify the authorship of a document would be required. Also, in this case, the blockchain would be vital to guarantee the existence of a document, at a given time. The same considerations could be made for use cases exploiting the blockchain to store public records.  Use cases belonging to the education scenario would also need to rely on the blockchain, in order to bring beneﬁts to learners around the globe. This fact is supported by what has been experienced in the last 20 years, in which more and more initiatives have been performed to lower transnational barriers in order to enable a better mobility [43, 46]. These use cases would also need well-deﬁned standards to record learners’ acquired competencies, as they would require that University’s staff receives a proper training on how to insert information on the blockchain. Nonetheless, some automatic solutions could be realized, e.g., which trigger a transaction as soon as a degree is earned, or an exam is passed.  Supply chain is probably one of the scenarios which would beneﬁt the most from the blockchain. In fact, here the blockchain could record information written by the multiple actors involved in the production of components. This use case, though, would require substantial investments, e.g., to adapt existing Enterprise Resource Planning  ERP  systems to read write data on the blockchain, or to manage the blockchain itself. In fact, for supply chain, permissioned blockchains  blockchains which provide read write rights only to a limited number of actors  should be pre- ferred to permissionless blockchains  “open” blockchains such as the Bitcoin one . Consequently, companies should foresee also the costs for building and maintain- ing the blockchain infrastructure. It must be underlined, though, that some prod- ucts already exist, which simplify the integration of traditional systems with the blockchain, such as the Arxum connection box [3], a box which could be mounted on production machines and that periodically reads writes data from a public blockchain. With these solutions, companies’ legacy systems could be easily interfaced with a blockchain. Still in the supply chain scenario, it must be underlined that exploiting the blockchain to avoid counterfeit items could be another use case, which could not be easily realized with traditional systems. At this purpose, though, it must be said that not all the items could be stored on the blockchain, as the item would need to have a unique identiﬁer possibly impressed on it. Should the blockchain be used for tracking goods’ provenance, instead, the costs should be deeply evaluated. In   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  107  fact, it could be imagined that a public blockchain would be exploited to achieve this goal. Each step in the production delivery of a good would require a transac- tion recorded on the blockchain, with a consequent fee. Hence, it could be worth performing tracking only for items above a given price.  Other use cases, which could widely beneﬁt from blockchain, are the ones related to the sharing economy. In particular, in all those situations in which a DAO would be needed, the blockchain is the key enabling technology, as traditional systems would need at least the third institution managing interactions among parties. Hence, the decentralized lending use case is one of the use cases that will beneﬁt the most from blockchain technology, as intermediaries would be completely removed. Similarly, car sharing renting as well as house sharing are among the use cases which could not be realized in a decentralized manner, without relying on the blockchain. In case such applications rely on intelligent locks [54, 97, 113], decentralization and automation could be even higher. Decentralized insurances could as well proﬁt from blockchain-based solutions. With respect to the insurance use case, though, it must be said that the claims evaluation process could not be fully automatized, as some claims would still need an evaluation carried out by experts, before being refunded. Similar considerations could be made for use cases related to the tokenization of assets. To make an example, a good could be shared among multiple owners, but, in case of its damage, it would need to be inspected by the third impartial party. Apart from the drawbacks just described, what is truly astonishing is that blockchain technology enables the interactions among intelligent items, such as appliances, vehicles, etc., which acquire the possibility to manage money  in the form of cryptocurrencies , to earn them  e.g., by selling sensors’ data , or to spend them  e.g., for replacements or in exchange for other services . Without blockchain, this type of interactions could not be realized  apart from, for example, letting the intelligent appliance store one’s credit card data, solution which would still need to rely on the credit card provider . Use cases which could be easily realized with other technologies, and in which the blockchain does not  could not  play a key role, are generally related to those sit- uations in which a company proposes to exploit blockchain to improve the efﬁciency of its backend tasks. In fact, in this case, the blockchain could introduce unnecessary complexity, to already working solutions. Hence, for example, in the case of auto- matic ﬂight delay insurance refunds, similar solutions could be realized with services periodically checking ﬂight status, which would trigger reimbursements in case of delay higher than a given threshold. At this purpose, it must be said that probably the objective of this type of insurances was also to provide customers with a guarantee of company’s transparency. Nonetheless, it must be said that, at least in developed countries, insurance companies are generally well-known, and subject to controls to ensure their solvency. Hence, in this case, the level of trustworthiness provided by the blockchain could be marginal. In a similar way, blockchain-based lottery systems could be superﬂuous, in case the whole process is managed by the government.  Finally, it could be worth highlighting some use cases which could require a blockchain, but which would need further considerations before fully employ it. The ﬁrst use case is related to government-related activities, such as elections manage- ment and DAO-based autonomous governance. Concerning elections management,   108  V. Gatteschi et al.  it must be underlined that particular attention should be devoted to privacy issues. In fact, in order to guarantee the anonymity of votes, private keys should be assigned randomly and should not be traced. Hence, it could be expected that blockchain-based voting systems would encounter some kind of resistance from citizens. For what it regards DAO-based autonomous governance, this use case is probably not  yet  real- izable, given the actual technological development status. In fact, this use case would strongly rely on smart contracts to manage a Nation. As witnessed by famous attacks to smart contracts, their self-execution could make them “candy for hackers” [135]. Hence, in this case, an error in the smart contract’s code could have tremendous consequences  also smart contracts exploited in sharing economy-related use cases could contain errors, but the loss for the end user could be limited to some hundreds of dollars .  Similarly to election blockchain-based systems, healthcare-related use cases would need to devote particular attention to the privacy of users. In fact, the access to health data should be granted only to selected actors.  Other use cases such as the execution of last will, or the management of pension or family’s funds, should be carefully evaluated. In fact, in this case, the smart contract would have full control of a high amount of money  cryptocurrencies . Here, not only errors in the smart contract could jeopardize one’s ﬁnances. Instead, other factors contribute at increasing the risk of these solutions. First of all, cryptocurrencies’ volatility, which could decrease the ﬁnal received amount of money. Second, as a winning blockchain solution is missing, there is no guarantee that existing blockchain frameworks will still exist, 20 years from now.  Finally, it must be underlined that a threat for use cases in which smart contracts rule the interactions among parties is the legal implications of smart contracts. In fact, at the present time, smart contracts encode the mechanisms for transferring funds. Nonetheless, there could be smart contract’s transactions which are against the law, e.g., because the smart contract regulates the transaction of illegal goods [104], or because it is exploited to steal money. Hence, when adopting a smart contract, one should keep in mind that only simple smart contracts could also have legal validity, as the ones that will be developed in the Jur context [60].  5 Conclusions  This chapter aimed at providing the reader with a list of use cases which could rely on blockchain and smart contracts, in order to improve his her knowledge of potential repercussions of this technology. In particular, the chapter ﬁrst reported a glossary of blockchain-related terms  which are deeply presented in the other chapters of the present book . Then, around a hundred use cases have been presented, belonging to ten sectors, ranging from ﬁnance and insurance to industry, government, and others. Finally, a discussion has been made, on the use cases which could beneﬁt the most from blockchain and smart contracts.   Blockchain Technology Use Cases  109  The result of the discussion is that use cases related to supply chain are among the ones which could widely beneﬁt from blockchain, as it could empower multiple actors with the capability of writing reading information shared across the whole chain. Use cases related to the sharing economy, which aim at ruling the interaction among different actors, without relying on an intermediary, could beneﬁt from the blockchain as well.  While investments in the two above-described use cases could be high, other use cases could successfully exploit the blockchain without requiring massive invest- ments. This is the case of cryptocurrencies transfers, for which well-established practices exist, of KYC, which could be performed by eventually relying on exter- nal companies, and of proof of existence storage of public records, which could be realized by exploiting existing services. Another use case, which could beneﬁt from a shared ledger, is the certiﬁcation of competencies acquired by learners. For this scenario, though, best practices still need to be implemented, despite some standard- ization has already been performed [12].  Use cases which could be easily realized with existing technologies are generally related to company’s backend activities. In this view, the need to have transparency in company’s operations is not as relevant as in frontend tasks. Hence, smart contracts are generally employed to make some tasks automatics. At this purpose, it must be highlighted that the same result could be achieved by developing services  e.g., hosted on company’s servers  which gather the needed information and perform activities accordingly. In case of use cases exploiting the blockchain to increase the transparency of the company, it must be said that in some cases, well-established companies already have a good reputation; hence, they would probably not need to reinforce it by means of the blockchain.  Finally, some use cases have been discussed, which would beneﬁt from the blockchain, but that would need additional considerations before a mainstream adop- tion. Such use cases are related to blockchain-based election management, for which ensuring privacy of the votes would be essential, and DAO-based autonomous gov- ernance systems, which could particularly suffer from errors in smart contracts. Healthcare-related use cases would also need to protect patients’ data. Other use cases, in which smart contracts manage a high portion of funds for a long time could still be threatened by code bugs or hacker’s attacks. Furthermore, relying on a smart contract for more than a couple of years could be a bad choice, as the blockchain infrastructure hosting the smart contract could disappear  e.g., because maintaining the network is no more proﬁtable, for miners . Particular attention should also be devoted to the legal implications of smart contracts, which are still not clear and subject of discussions [39, 40, 67, 81].  Surely, even though probably not all the applications presented in this chapter will be successful, what is sure is that blockchain and smart contracts still continue to be an incredible, fascinating technology which will bring tremendous changes to the world, as we know it.

Blockchain Meets Cybersecurity: Security, Privacy, Challenges, and Opportunity  Philip Asuquo, Chibueze Ogah, Waleed Hathal and Shihan Bao  Abstract The interest in blockchain technology has grown over the years as a result of its prospect to transform business processes. The number of companies rushing to explore blockchain applications has grown rapidly due to its inherent robustness to cyberattack. This book chapter explores the use of blockchain technology in the Internet of Things  IoT  and the relationship between blockchain and cybersecurity technologies in the IoT ecosystem. We give an insight to security and privacy using blockchain and the substantial positive changes this technology will bring alongside its challenges.  Keywords Blockchain· Distributed ledger technology· Distributed systems· Internet of things· Security  1 Introduction  Blockchain technology was initially developed as an open transaction ledger for cryptocurrency [1]. In 2008, the authors in [2] introduced blockchain as an emerging Peer-to-Peer  P2P  technology for decentralized data sharing and distributed com- puting. Blockchain is described by the authors in [3] as a ledger of blocks that are temper-resistant useful in storing and sharing data.  In addition to being a powerful innovation tool with the potential of bringing substantive positive change in technology, this technology has attracted enormous attention from academics, ﬁnancial industry, and policy-makers. Blockchain tech- nology can be used to decentralize network architectures, provide security, privacy, anonymity, and tamper-prooﬁng of devices [4]. Other areas of blockchain application include distribution of healthcare data, veriﬁcation of location by proof, and securing robotic swarms [5].  P.

Notwithstanding the many beneﬁts of blockchain especially in cybersecurity, this technology is subject to cybersecurity risk as well as human errors. One of the features of Blockchain technology is the consensus mechanism which is susceptible to identity-based attacks performed by a blockchain node to gain control over several blockchain nodes in an infrastructure. This chapter is summarized as follows: in Sect. 1.1, we discuss the importance of blockchain for conventional IoT systems, in Sect. 2, we discuss the security and privacy requirements for IoT, Sect. 3 discusses blockchain and blockchain in IoT cybersecurity is discussed in Sect. 4, we discuss the challenges, opportunities, and open issues in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6.  1.1 Consensus Mechanisms  For conventional IoT systems, blockchain enhances the integrity and the robustness of ledgers that are shared. This is as a result of the consensus protocol which is across multiple blockchain entities or networks before a new block of data is validated [6]. This feature prevents the ledger from being compromised or manipulated.  1.2 Decentralization  One key feature of blockchain technology is the decentralization of access control functions from the central manager or certiﬁcate authority. There is no central man- ager or authority in blockchain unlike in traditional security and trust management frameworks. In blockchain technology, each participating node has a copy of the transaction performed and a new transaction is validated by each node acting as a miner [7]. An example of this feature has been illustrated by the authors in [8] where blockchain technology is used to implement a secure RSU hand over when vehicles move from one region to another. In general, the decentralization feature of blockchain protects the network from a compromise or single point of failure problems.  1.3 Transparency  Blockchain technology ensures that there is transparency among the participating nodes or entities by carrying out frequent checks and self-auditing to reconcile trans- actions at regular intervals. This protects blockchains from malware or attacks to compromise the ledger because each node or entity has a real-time copy of the ledger with an enhanced compliance auditing process. As described in [9], the Decen- tralized Autonomous Organization  DAO , which is controlled by stakeholders, ensures the transparency of rules encoded by a computer program. The DAO ensures that the digital ledger is secure by tracking ﬁnancial transactions across the Internet and ensuring trusted time stamping by stakeholders to avoid forgery.   Blockchain Meets Cybersecurity…  1.4 Immutability  117  The immutability of blockchain is an essential feature for auditing data. At the moment, immutability remains one of the most lauded features of blockchain especially in ﬁnancial transactions. This feature is a precondition that enables the detection and prevention of double spending. However, the emergence of quantum computing poses a major threat to this feature since blockchains highly rely on Public Key Infrastructure  PKI . Although very efﬁcient, the proof of work is computationally expensive and very inefﬁcient in the context of energy servings which is critical for IoT devices [4]. The subject of the dangers posed by attackers with quantum computation powers is currently an area of active debate.  2 Security and Privacy Requirements for IoT  2.1 Authentication  Security experts have identiﬁed blockchain technology as an alternative to long rec- ognized tradition of using passwords which are inadequate [10], especially against adversaries with quantum computation powers. Asymmetric encryption or public key cryptography, which is a widely accepted cryptography solution uses a public and private key for message authentication. In asymmetric key management, the public key is made accessible to the sender of the message such as broadcast safety messages in ITS [8]. This message is valid when the recipient matches its private key to the sender’s public key. However, this method incurs a lot of communication and computational overhead as described by the authors in [11].  Blockchain technology introduces an alternative to PKI-based solutions, with the introduction of Self-Sovereign Identity  SSI  in the distribution ledger technology, a web of trust model is used to provide immutable recording of historical events which are associated with the public key and its sender.  2.2 Conﬁdentiality  The National Institute of Standards and Technology describes conﬁdentiality as an attribute that describes the non-disclosure of information to unauthorized entities. For blockchain, conﬁdentiality is a very important property that will encourage its adoption. Several techniques have been proposed to hide the identities or key details of transactions in private and public blockchains. We provide a brief overview of these solutions as listed below:   118  P. Asuquo et al.  – Key Deﬁnition Functions. One of the widely used techniques for enhancing anonymity is the Key Distribution Function  KDF . The KDF requires the use of a new key for each new transaction which must correspond to an address. This method is different from the traditional techniques used which was based on ran- dom key generation. For modern wallets in blockchain, keys are generated using deterministic key deﬁnition functions which produce new keys from the master key as the need arises. The KDF technique provides a considerable level of con- ﬁdentiality to protect the network against opportunistic identiﬁcation.  – Blockstream Conﬁdential Transactions. In public blockchains, several solutions have been proposed to provide conﬁdentiality in transactions [3]. One of these is the conﬁdential transaction technique which uses the concept of commitment scheme. This scheme allows participating entities to commit values without revealing these values to other participating entities. In addition to this, conﬁdential transaction supports homomorphic addition of values without exposing the amount in the transaction.  – On-Chain Encryption. The aforementioned techniques provide conﬁdentiality for public blockchain, and this is different for private blockchain as conﬁdentiality is a mandatory property. On-chain encryption provides encryption to intending participants only. This means that information is not shared with every member, transnational data is encrypted, and only participating members can decrypt it. This technique has been lauded for its simplicity and robustness as it does not compromise the desired properties of blockchain [12].  – Blockchain Centralization. In blockchain technology, data can be localized to prevent exposure. This concept uses simple transaction request which is sent to the central server or location. The sender receives a cryptographic hash or token which shows that transaction has been successful. This technique guarantees privacy as none of the participating nodes or entities have access to the full copy of the data. Although conﬁdentiality is achieved, this results in a huge computational overhead as it removes the distribution property of blockchain which is a key motivation for this technology [13].  2.3 Accountability and Non-repudiation  Accountability is achieved in blockchain technology through time stamping. This means that every blockchain user can reliably verify that the information provided across all entities are agreeable. The exclusion of external parties can affect account- ability when constructing blockchain. The authors in [14] point out that feasibility of external audits is closely related to accountability. Accountability means that author- ities such as Trusted Authorities  TA  and Certiﬁcation Authorities  CA  can detect system malfunctions and provide ambiguous proof of its public use. Non-Repudiation is another useful feature provided by blockchain technology. Every node should be able to verify the authenticity of the transactions or statements used in blockchain.   Blockchain Meets Cybersecurity…  119  Digital signature [15] is used alongside with public key infrastructure PKI [16] to provide a reliable time stamping. This prevents colluding attacks on the blockchain network and prevents backdating of statements by malicious users.  2.4 Traceability and Revocation  In dealing with non-integrated and complex supply chain of business, the notion of sustainability, transparency, and fair trade are of great importance in decision- making for customers [16]. The combination of IoT and blockchain technologies has a potential to address the drawbacks in provenance and traceability.  Blockchain technology allows users to record an event or a transaction that has occurred within the supply chain. The efﬁciency of the supply chain is based on trust and it is very important to maintain the transparency by ensuring the visibility of transactions which must be traceable to the ledger [17]. The validity of each certiﬁcates transaction is shorter than certiﬁcates published. A web server is forced to periodically publish its certiﬁcates and update its revocation status. The next transaction to be performed does not contain a certiﬁcate which has been revoked even if it has not expired. The revocation list of the CA is recorded in a transparent manner in certiﬁcate blockchain. In blockchain, a certiﬁcate is accepted only when it is published with a valid transaction.  2.5 Privacy  In [18], the authors describe privacy in blockchain as the ability to protect transac- tional data unreadable to third parties. The privacy in blockchain technology varies based on the use of the transactional data, although the same rules may apply for personal data. The most common use of blockchain in IoT is for storing of data and remote access. Privacy preservation is very important as the user must be able to access data remotely with full access control policies implemented. The problem of processing and storing encrypted data poses serious threats to the user. In smart con- tracts, for example, the challenge of concealing the primary function of the contracts private character and keeping it veriﬁable with other participants remains an open issue.  3 Categories of Blockchain  There have been several blockchain architectures developed to meet business, government, and technical objectives since 2008 [19]. There are two categories of blockchain frequently used in literature; public and permissioned blockchains. The   120  P. Asuquo et al.  authors in [20] explain that blockchain lacks a conceptual deﬁnition due to its broad properties. We brieﬂy describe public and private blockchains as well as federated blockchain in the subsections below.  3.1 Public Blockchain  Public Blockchains often referred to as permissionless blockchain such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other open access blockchain technologies allow participants to view and access the ledger [3]. In public blockchain, participants can propose the addition of new blocks to the ledger and use already established protocols to validate transactions  i.e., each participating node can execute the consensus protocol . Pub- lic blockchain technologies are often considered as fully decentralized blockchain systems and anyone can join the network with full read and write permission with no entity having total control over the network. One of the major issues in public blockchain is compliance regulations, and there must be legal or technical mechanism to enforce compliance for network stability. There is always an offer in the form of economic incentives for participants who make utilize the algorithm of proof of work.  3.2 Private Blockchain  Private blockchain is often referred to as permissioned blockchain technology [21]. In this category of blockchain, the participants have the capacity to restrict those who will take part in the consensus mechanism. The network can select a group of participants who are given the authority to validate transaction blocks. In [22], the authors point out that permissioned blockchains are distributed databases that help blockchain participants to select member that will participate in the consensus mechanism and participants who can validate transactions. Full authority is given to participants mainly through veriﬁcation by registered participants of the group. The selection of access rights to participants in a private blockchain network provides a higher level of privacy [5]. Although private blockchain uses cryptography to secure its database, private blockchain has a lot of limitation as it is not fully decentralized and all the participants cannot make transactions, authenticate, or validate changes made in the ledger.  3.3 Consortium or Federated Blockchain  The consortium blockchain is different from public blockchain, and they are often referred to as confederated blockchain [8]. In consortium blockchain, a group of participants is given access control rather than a single entity. Two types of consortia blockchain have been identiﬁed in literature; technology-focused and business-focused consortia. While business-focused blockchain technologies are   Blockchain Meets Cybersecurity…  121  developed to solve speciﬁc business problems especially in ﬁnancial services, technology-focused blockchain focuses on the development of reusable blockchain platforms which are based on technical standards [23]. In Table 1, a brief summary on the different categories of blockchain is provided.  Several blockchain technologies have been proposed in literature, and in Table 2, we compare some of these technologies and their security properties. Beyond the blockchain approaches which have been widely accepted, there has been a wide range of distributed ledger technologies emerging with different application speciﬁcations.

Asuquo et al.  4 Blockchain in IoT Cybersecurity  Several approaches have been used to incorporate Blockchain into IoT to strengthen its security [25]. There has been growing interest on the initiative of blockchain inte- gration into production and supply chain. Companies like IBM have used their cloud infrastructure to provide support for blockchain services for tracking of high valuable assets. IBM’s IoT platform allows the addition of selected data to private blockchain ledgers before it is included in shared transactions [30]. In [16], the authors propose a decentralized architecture for the expansion of the IoT ecosystem. They point out the high cost of maintenance incurred by centralized models considering the distribution of updates from software across millions of devices. The traditional Internet system which is centralized cannot meet the development needs of IoT especially with the security of information that is sensitive across multiple devices. This makes the combination of blockchain and IoT inevitable. One promising blockchain technology is smart contracts, which has been suggested for automation of workﬂow in IoT ecosystems [31]. We brieﬂy look into some existing work in IoT using blockchain to provide security. In [32], the authors describe blockchain’s smart contracts as the backbone of IoT ecosystem. They point out that blockchain can be used in smart homes to reduce the management cost of IoT devices. In [33], a smart-contract-based network is proposed for IoT systems with a framework that has multiple access control to ensure a distributed and trusted IoT system.  4.1 Solutions Proposed for Secure Communications  and Identity of Things  One of the challenging issues in IoT blockchain is identity and access management. The ownership and identity of IoT devices are the major challenges in the implemen- tation of an effective security and trustworthy solution for IoT devices [6]. During the lifetime of IoT devices, their ownership often changes from manufacturer down to the users and are sometimes resold during their life cycle. This often affects the trust in the IoT system as it cannot be revoked or changed when the ownership has been transferred to a third-party buyer [16]. An efﬁcient approach to solve these challenges efﬁciently is the use of blockchain technology. In [34], Trustchain is pro- posed to enable trustworthy transactions. Trustchain uses a public blockchain that uses a data structure that is tamper-proof for the storage of transaction records. The authors create an immutable chain of trust which is temporary for transaction storage. In Trustchain, each user creates his own block from inception in parallel with other users. TrustChain also looks into the trustworthiness of the blockchain network using a Sybil detection algorithm and a netﬂow device. In [18], the authors identiﬁed 18 use cases of blockchain technology, four categories are speciﬁed which align with security in IoT. The ﬁrst category deals with the IoT management and data access control using an immutable log of events [35], the second category focuses on trading   Blockchain Meets Cybersecurity…  123  data which has been collected in the IoT ecosystem [36, 37], and the third deals with the PKI for IoT devices using symmetric and asymmetric key management schemes [8, 38]. In [39], the authors propose a framework for industrial IoT applications. This approach allows blockchain participants to communicate with the cloud infrastruc- ture and the blockchain network. The IoT devices send data to the cloud for analysis and storage using a simple board computer while transactions from other devices are received through the blockchain network. In [33], the authors review the application of smart contracts in IoT. They enumerate how smart contracts support autonomous workﬂow and information sharing among IoT devices. However, they argue that smart contracts have a lot of limitations due to resource constraints in IoT and single point of failure caused by the architectural design of the IoT framework for smart contracts.  5 Challenges and Open Issues  Although blockchain is a promising technology with great potentials, it has numer- ous challenges which limits its usage. We enumerate some of the major issues in blockchain technology as follows.  5.1 Lack of Standards and Regulations  One of the main issues in blockchain is the lack of standardization. The authors in [16] proposed Criminal Smart Contract  CSC  framework to address mali- cious activities such as eavesdropping, compromise of cryptographic keys, and time-stamp dependence attacks. It is difﬁcult to control and monitor the behavior of smart contracts when a malicious event occurs due to the lack of an effective regulation mechanism. There is a need for security protocols that inter-operate on different layers for standardization. Although a few protocols have been developed in confederated blockchain technologies [4], these protocols need to inter-operate to provide an effective global mechanism for IoT security. As highlighted in [14], there is a need for a framework that should address the core functions: identify threats, protect the system, detect anomalies, respond to threats, and prompt recovery after an attack. Focusing on these core functions will help in the standardization and regulation of public and private blockchain technologies.  5.2 Scalability  Scalability is an important factor that must be considered for blockchain-based IoT security. IoT devices are resource constrained which makes it difﬁcult to implement a full blockchain solution due to the growth of the chains which occur every 1 MB   124  P. Asuquo et al.  per block for every 10 min [40]. As the size of the transaction record grows, more resources are required which reduces the capacity and scalability of the system. The oversized chain affects the performance and delays the synchronization of the blocks. During the validation of transactions which is the key component of the distributed consensus protocol, a high computational overhead is incurred as a result of the modulate power required, time between the blocks, and the number of transaction blocks.  5.3 Firmware and Hardware Vulnerabilities  The IoT framework may become more vulnerable to attacks with more low-cost and low-power devices added to the IoT infrastructure. Apart from the malfunctioning of the hardware, the processing of packets by routing, especially through multi- hop routing requires some level of veriﬁcation. This is as a result of the challenges experienced in detecting or alleviating any vulnerability in the hardware after the system has been deployed.  5.4 Lack of Trusted Authorities and Data Feeds  Blockchain for IoT requires external data from real world which are not part of the blockchain network. There is need for a trusted third party or trusted data feed to serve as an intermediary between blockchain and the real world data. Although blockchain can become an enabler for this process by providing security and acting as a trusted backbone for a large-scale adoption of IoT, the technology itself has its own challenges ranging from scalability, efﬁciency, to security issues such as key collision.  5.5 Irreversible Bugs in IoT Blockchain  Blockchains transactions are irreversible in nature, and this affects its deployment as transaction records cannot be modiﬁed once they are ﬁnalized. This means that if there is a bug in a transaction record, there is no feasible solution apart from triggering an update. This new process affects previous records as data stored in the old transaction records is not transferred automatically to the triggered update in the new record.   Blockchain Meets Cybersecurity…  125  5.6 Challenges in Smart Contracts  Blockchain has been widely used in smart contracts for IoT security. We highlight some of the challenges encountered in smart contracts, namely [25]:  – Time-stamp dependence: The miners in smart contracts can modify the time stamps set by them for a few seconds from the block they mined. This introduces collusion based on interest as long as the other miners accept the new blocks proposed.  – Dependence on the order of transactions: Since the miner determines the order of execution of the blocks, the miner can manipulate the order of execution while executing these transactions.  – Call stack depth: This occurs when there is contract invocation which results in the growth of the transaction frame. An exception is thrown when there is a contract invocation when the limit is reached. A malicious user can generate a full call stack by invoking the targeted user’s function which throws an exception. This exception affects the targeted user’s contract if not handled properly.  6 Conclusion  As the dependency on blockchain application grows, the application of blockchain in IoT security has become a very hot topic of research in both industrial and academic communities. As discussed in this chapter, IoT devices are incapable of self-defense due to their constrained nature, lack of standards, lack of secure hardware, and software design and their deployment. The effort of developing a robust mechanism for the security of IoT devices has been hindered due to the variation of interest in IoT ecosystems. This book chapter reviews the main IoT security issues associated with the adoption of blockchain for IoT security. We present a comprehensive overview of blockchain as it relates with IoT security and its applications. We also present some challenges and open issues in this research area.  References  1.

It provides a decentralized platform to execute transactions with mutual trust among the par- ticipants, while at the same time, eliminating the presence of a central mediating authority. Record of every transaction is stored in the Blockchain and is entirely tamper-proof. Blockchain creates a peer-to-peer network where all nodes get to ver- ify transactions occurring in the network, through a consensus-based governance system. It has been used to implement the world’s most popular cryptocurrency Bit- coin. This is a highly promised technology, which is being adopted and implemented in several domains, such as Internet-of-Things-based systems, health care, energy systems, education systems, banking, and many more.

Bhadoria et al.  of each transaction is veriﬁed by the consent of a majority of the participants in the system. All participants mutually agree and are aware of the transaction processed along with the identities of all individuals involved in the transaction. The nature of all records in the Blockchain is unalterable. Once a transaction record is put into the Blockchain, it cannot ever be removed. This makes it impossible to make up a transaction that never occurred, which results in a private, secure, and decentralized system. Blockchain technology is a distributed model that has found its applications in many ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial sectors.  Blockchain is the technology that underpins the world’s ﬁrst and most widely used decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The participants of Bitcoin, who use this digital currency by sending and receiving bitcoins in exchange for commodities and services, generate transactions for the Blockchain. These transactions are pushed into a block and once a block is ﬁlled, it gets appended to the chain. This happens through a process called mining. The users, known as miners, solve a mathematical and resource consuming problem, called Proof-of-Work  PoW . The node that solves the problem ﬁrst gets to mine the block to the Blockchain. Through this process, the chain continues as each new transaction record is added to it. One of the signiﬁcant characteristics of the Blockchain is that the transaction history is available to all involved parties, hence it is impossible to make up any fake transactions. This is an example and a highlight of the Blockchain’s secure, decentralized, and private nature, which has a great potential to face the challenges posed by the Internet of Things  IoT .  The IoT is a massive network of various computing devices, embedded in everyday objects which are interconnected with each other. The IoT network enables them to transfer and handle the data. These objects can be mechanical devices, digital devices, and even RFID-tagged animals [1]. The ‘Things’ in IoT are provided with unique identiﬁers  UIDs  and are embedded with sensors, processors, and other communication hardware. According to Gartner, there was an estimated 8.4 billion IoT devices in the world in 2017 and this number is expected to grow as by 2020 more than 65% of enterprises will adopt IoT products. The essence of the IoT is to empower the connected devices to interchange and compute data in order to interact with their environment and make decisions without the involvement of any human- to-computer interactions.  Sensors are a vital part of such devices. With the medium of embedded sensors, these devices gather data from their environment and make decisions, such as air conditioners adjusting their temperature settings, smart watches tracking the daily activities of their users, etc. These sensors continually emit data about the working state of the devices and this data is dumped onto the IoT network. Data is received from a wide range of devices, some of which may differ from others in the nature of their functionalities to a huge extent. IoT collects and integrates this data to perform the required analytics and extract valuable information as required. This informa- tion is then shared with all the devices connected to the network to enhance their functionalities.   On the Role of Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things  131  Fig. 1 Representing the integration of Blockchain into IoT networks  The term “Internet of Things” was ﬁrst used by Kevin Ashton in 1999, while proposing an idea to integrate RFID sensors into supply chain management at Proctor & Gamble [2]. It was used in the context of the idea that a large amount of data present on the Internet was made by direct interactions of humans with computers, such as typing, taking a picture or scanning a barcode [2]. This was an emphasis that our physical environment is composed of ‘things’, which are just as important a part of the Internet like ideas and data.  As shown in Fig. 1, Blockchain can be integrated into an IoT network, where each device acts as a unique participant in the chain. Blockchain acts as a secure and tamper-proof record of all communications and transactions in the network.  2 Characteristics of Blockchain Technology  Cryptocurrency is not the only sector where Blockchain ﬁnds its applications. Any industry that demands resource management and transaction handling can use Blockchain. This technology is useful in numerous sectors ranging from ﬁnancial to medical industries. Blockchain has also been implemented in projects, such as a peer-to-peer-based solar electricity grid in New York [3] and smart homes that are secured by Blockchain [4]. The core characteristics of Blockchain, such as security, privacy, and immutability offer solutions to many implementation challenges. These characteristics are discussed in detail in this section.  Decentralization: The decentralized nature of Blockchain eliminates many risks that are observed in a centralized database. The distributed scheme does not provide a centralized target for attackers to exploit. Likewise, it does not have any central point of failure that can halt the system if compromised. In Blockchain technology, identical copies of the database ﬁle are owned by all nodes present in the network. Whenever a new block is to be added to the chain, the mutual consent of all participants is   132  R. S. Bhadoria et al.  required. This is done by a consensus algorithm, which also ensures the integrity of all copies distributed across the network. A new block of transactions being added is veriﬁed by all parties on the basis of the consensus protocol and all nodes update their respective copies of the Blockchain. The consensus algorithm also defends against attacks trying to fork the chain. Thus, the consensus algorithm is responsible for maintaining the legitimacy of all blocks being added to the Blockchain.  In this ground-breaking paper on Bitcoin in 2008, Nakamoto proposed a consensus model called Proof-of-Work  POW . This requires nodes that are participating in the consensus process to solve a computationally difﬁcult mathematical puzzle. This is done by brute-forcing random solutions until the problem is solved. This is a low probability process and requires a lot of trial and error to generate the ﬁnal solution. When a valid proof-of-work is generated by a node, it gets to push the block to the chain. This process is called as mining in the context of Bitcoin and the node is called as a miner. The Proof-of-Work algorithm has signiﬁcant drawbacks, such as the requirement for high computational resources and latency in conﬁrming the transactions. According to Power Compare [5], the amount of electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining has crossed the electricity consumption levels of 159 countries and most countries in Africa. In spite of these disadvantages, the Proof-of-Work algorithm renders the Bitcoin system invulnerable to attacks like the Sybil Attack, Denial of Service, and also solves the double spending problem. Apart from Proof-of-Work, a few other consensus models, such as Proof-of-Stake, Delegated Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Burn, Proof-of-Elapsed Time, and Proof-of-Capacity can also be used in a Blockchain [6].  Immutability: Blockchain maintains a history of all transactions performed by the participants in the network, ever since it was created. As the name suggests, the Blockchain can be visualized as a chain of blocks that are linked to each other in a lin- ear fashion. Each block contains information, such as transaction details, timestamps, metadata, block speciﬁc details and more. When a block is ﬁlled with information, it is added to the Blockchain. The Blockchain running Ethereum cryptocurrency has a block size under 2 KB. The Bitcoin Blockchain has a size of 1 MB per block.  When a hash function meets a set of ﬁxed properties, such as deterministic outputs, pre-image resistance, collision resistance, and quick computation, it can be called as a cryptographic hash function. A cryptographic hash function is an essential concept for linking two adjacent blocks in a Blockchain. It generates a ﬁxed output string known as a hash for an input of any length. The NSA-developed SHA-256 algorithm generates an output hash of 256 bits. When represented in the hexadecimal system, this becomes 64 digits long. The size of the output hash would be the same if the input was a single character string or even a full-sized novel. Every block in the Blockchain has its own unique signature, represented by a hash generated by taking the data inside that block, and the hash of the previous block. Every block in the Blockchain includes the hash of the previous block in its own hash. This is true for all blocks in the chain, the only exception being the very ﬁrst block, which does not have any parent block included in its hash. It is also known as the Genesis block. Genesis blocks are hard-coded into Blockchain clients.   On the Role of Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things  133  Fig. 2 The interlinking of hashes in a blockchain  As shown in Fig. 2, the hash of block 1 includes transaction details of that block, other information such as metadata or timestamps and importantly, the hash of the previous block. This hash is then included in the hash of block 2. This interlinking of hashes occurs across all the blocks in the entire chain.  The interlinking of hashes across the entire length of the Blockchain makes it infeasible for the data inside the blocks to be tampered with. One of the properties of an ideal cryptographic hash function is that even the smallest of changes in the input, such as changing one letter or the addition or removal of a space result in completely different hashes. Hence, if a malicious entity attempted to change the data in a particular block, it would result in a new signature for that block. As this signature is included in the next block’s hash, it has to be recomputed also. Due to all blocks being interlinked, the hash of every single block following the modiﬁed block has to be recomputed. Meanwhile, the chain is constantly growing with new blocks being added to it continuously. So, along with computing hashes for the altered blocks, the malicious entity also needs to calculate signatures for all new blocks being added. Doing this would require more computing power than the rest of the network combined. Computing a hash for a block is a resource-consuming task because only a certain type of hash is accepted as valid. For instance, as of date, the Bitcoin Blockchain only accepts a block if its hash starts with 18 consecutive zeros.  In the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, for computing a valid hash, the infor- mation contained in a block constantly changes until the required pattern is generated in the output hash. As the block contains information, such as transaction details or timestamps, which cannot be changed, a certain segment of data is introduced in the block whose sole signiﬁcance is to alter the generated hash. This part of the data is called nonce of the block, and can be a collection of any random alphanumeric characters. This process of changing the nonce is repeated on a trial and error basis, until a valid hash is generated. Thereafter, this block is broadcasted by the miner onto the network where all the remaining miners verify the validity of its signa- ture. Once they reach a mutual agreement, the block is added on to the Blockchain. All copies of the Blockchain across the network update themselves. Hashing is a resource-consuming process and the interlinked hashes make it infeasible to alter   134  R. S. Bhadoria et al.  any part of the Blockchain. Thus, once a block is added on to the chain, it remains there forever in the exact form that it was added and is immutable.  Consensus based: A transaction can be deﬁned as an exchange of assets between the involved parties. Every transaction must verify its authenticity and validity. Today’s traditional transaction systems employ a trusted agent in the system to per- form these validations. For example, a money transfer between two individuals can be done through a bank. The bank is responsible for verifying the identities of both par- ties through a protocol, such as 3D secure, and ensuring that the money is received by the recipient. The bank acts as a trusted medium in this system. Blockchain eliminates this need for a third party to act as a trusted intermediary for mediating transactions. Instead, the blockchain’s working is governed by its underlying implementation and its consensus-based system. The consensus protocol deﬁned in the Blockchain allows users to carry out transactions without having a central agency. The responsibility of verifying the validity and authenticity of the assets transferred in a decentralized system, such as the Blockchain is of the consensus algorithm. It deﬁnes the rules that make a transaction valid and prevents the same money from being spent twice. The Blockchain follows a governance model similar to the democracy where the truth is decided as whatever being said by a majority of the people. Bitcoin requires miners to submit a valid proof-of-work as required by the consensus algorithm to add their block to the chain accepted by the network.  Once a miner has generated a valid proof-of-work, by spending resources in the form of electricity, other miners have to verify the hash before it is mutually agreed that the block is placed on the Blockchain. Hence, the addition of a new block cannot be instantaneous and introduces latency. Due to this, a situation can arise when two miners propagate their computed blocks across the network at the same time. Some miners validate the ﬁrst block and some miners validate the other one. This results in Blockchain to split into two blocks. Out of these two blocks, the valid block is decided based upon which block has a higher proof-of-work, i.e., which block had utilized more resources to generate its signature. The two chains might also grow individually when the miners keep on adding blocks to either of the chains. The longer chain prevails as it contains more proof-of-work and is considered as the main chain and the Blockchain again grows independently as one. The longer chain represents a majority of votes as more resources have been spent by miners in creating and adding blocks to this chain, making it longer than the second chain. The other chain is termed as ‘orphan’ and the transactions are ignored. This is how the blockchain removes central entities and uses a democracy-based governance system for deciding what is accepted.  As shown in Fig. 3, when a split occurs in a Blockchain, the longer chain prevails because it contains more Proof-of-Work and is accepted as the main chain. The blocks in the other chain become ‘orphaned’ and their transactions are ignored.  Accessibility: Based on the accessibility of the Blockchain, it can be classiﬁed into two different categories: Permissionless  public  and Permissioned  private . A public Blockchain is open to all and anyone can join as either a participant or a consensus performing authority  miner . Private Blockchain has certain restrictions   On the Role of Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things  135  Fig. 3 Proof-of-Work in longer chains and orphaned nodes  installed on who can participate in the network. Permission from the enterprise own- ing the Blockchain has to be obtained prior to joining the network. The Hyperledger Fabric is an example of a permissioned Blockchain.  3 Block Time and Block Difﬁculty  Block difﬁculty: It is a measure of how difﬁcult it is to ﬁnd an eligible signature for a new block in terms of time or computational resources. Taking the example of bitcoin, more number of consecutive zeros required in a hash to become a valid signature, more is the block difﬁculty. The block difﬁculty adjusts itself according to the total computational resources available on the network. In bitcoin, if more miners join the network, the total mining capability of the network increases. This new network with more nodes and more mining power will ﬁnd it easier to generate a valid hash that has to start with ﬁve zeros than generating a hash that has to start with ten zeros [7].  To increase mining difﬁculty, the threshold value that forms the upper limit of the valid hashes is reduced. That is, this new condition for a hash to be valid will need to have more number of consecutive zeros than before. The Bitcoin Blockchain adjusts its mining difﬁculty in every 2 weeks.  Block time: It is deﬁned as the amount of time it takes to mine one block. Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain has both expected block times and average block times. Bitcoin’s expected block time is 1 block per 10 min. The average block time is calculated after N blocks have been mined. If the average block time is greater than the expected block time, the block difﬁculty is reduced. If the average block time is less than the expected block time, the block difﬁculty is increased.  Bitcoin has a block time of only 1 block per 10 min, because the Blockchain needs to propagate the newest block across all nodes in the network so that they can update their local copies. This is to ensure proper alignment and synchronization of the Blockchain in the network.   136  R. S.

Most of the IoT devices are lightweight and must employ a major part of whatever computational power they can fathom into their core functionality. This presents a signiﬁcant challenge in implementing the traditional security algorithms in IoT networks. It is said that the Blockchain has the potential to overcome this challenge due to its distributed nature [8]. Due to low bandwidth and low resource availability, integrating Blockchain with IoT is a task with a few challenges.  The IoT relies heavily on a centralized entity for the storage of the gathered data. From a security standpoint, this can lead to threats of distributed denial of service attacks  DDoS , man-in-the-middle attacks, and more. As such attacks exploit the centralized nature of a network, the integration of Blockchain into IoT can provide a new perspective for security measures and possibly solve the vulnerabilities found in a centralized system. Traditional IoT networks are dependent on the server client communication schemes, which is a centralized model. As stated in other work [9], even for the devices that are only a few feet apart, the connections have to go through the Internet.  In a Blockchain secured IoT network, a decentralized communication network between IoT devices can be implemented, where the Blockchain holds a unique identity of every device. Blockchain can implement a peer-to-peer communication model for large-scale IoT networks. It will provide validation and consensus for all transactions. Transaction records between the devices can be stored onto blocks that can be pushed into the Blockchain. The use of permissioned Blockchain is recommended for an IoT network [10]. Integration of the Blockchain into an IoT network from the perspective of security takes the following vulnerabilities into consideration:  Against Sybil attacks: A Sybil attack is deﬁned as an attempt to control a decen- tralized network by creating a large number of fake identities. A single user generates and controls these identities that look like genuine users to outsiders. Sybil attacks are difﬁcult to detect as it is not always evident that a large number of accounts are being controlled by a single entity in a network. Having a large number of accounts at disposal grants an undue advantage to the attacking entity. Against a Blockchain, the fake nodes can create unfair control over the network and even manipulate the ﬂow of data or transactions.  To prevent a Sybil attack: Some consensus algorithms in Blockchain like the Proof-of-Work are effective in mitigating an attack because Proof-of-Work requires a node to actually spend energy that cannot be retrieved back. So, it is infeasible to generate a large amount of fake nodes as that would require the expenditure of an equally large amount of resources.  Against man-in-the-middle attacks: In this attack, the attacker sits between the two parties involved in a transaction and intercepts all packets being sent in both directions of the network. All data is exposed to the attacker and information can be stolen or   On the Role of Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things  137  tampered with. In certain Blockchain, such attackers can manipulate the transfer of assets or information on the system by manipulating the destination addresses of transactions. It is impossible for the two parties to know the attacker’s presence. MITM attacks are quite dangerous as they can allow the injection of malware into the data, as the attacker appears to be a legitimate participant of the network.  Preventing a MITM attack: The methods enabling secure mutual authentication can be used to prevent such attacks from the Blockchain, as the one provided by BSeIn [11]. Mutual authentication with the use of elliptic curve encryption can also be employed for attack prevention [12].  Against double spending attacks: Entities try to use the same money twice. The Bitcoin Blockchain solves this problem by keeping a conﬁrmation mechanism that keeps track of the monetary details of each user in the Blockchain. When a transaction is carried out in Bitcoin, it goes into a pool of unconﬁrmed transactions. Miners pick transactions from here and add them into the block they are solving. If two duplicate transactions are sitting in the pool and they are picked up by two miners for their respective blocks, whenever one of these blocks in mined into the Blockchain, the other block will discard the duplicate transaction as invalid and the block will go stale. In the case when both of these blocks get mined together, it would result in a chain split and only one of these chains will prevail as the main chain. The other chain containing the duplicate transaction will be orphaned and the transaction will be ignored.  Against DDoS attacks: During a DDoS attack, a network is ﬂooded with an over- whelming number of queries or requests, which results in the network being slowed down or it might even crash due to the large amount of trafﬁc that is directed its way in the form of packets, connection requests, and more.  To prevent a DDoS attack: Blockchain can protect the IoT network from DDoS attack due to its consensus-based nature. Whenever miners spend their resources and compute the hash for a block, it gets added on to the Blockchain and validates all the previous transactions once again. The longer the Blockchain grows, the more resistant previous blocks become to any manipulations. To prevent DDoS attacks, CoinParty [13] proposed an idea based on decentralized mixing service.  Against impersonation attacks: An attacking entity tries to unauthorized opera- tions by disguising itself as a legitimate participant. The Blockchain hides the user’s privacy information and prevents impersonation attacks from happening.  Against routing attacks: A routing attack aims to intercept a message traveling through the network before it reaches its destination. The messages once intercepted are manipulated before sending them to their destinations. A routing attack can be detected by the network if the message received by one node is not the same as the message received by another. This signiﬁes that the message has been tampered with. The attacking entity can take measures to prevent this from happening by dividing the network into two or more parts and isolating the nodes.  Preventing routing attacks: Round Trip Times  RTT  can be used to detect these attacks by recognizing irregular patterns in it. If an attack is detected, the nodes can reset their connections by disconnecting from the older nodes and connecting to other random nodes in the network.   138  R. S. Bhadoria et al.  Blockchain when used as a security implementation for IoT networks clearly pro- vides much better security aspects than centralized networks. IoT networks imple- mented in this fashion can clearly bring many potential solutions to today’s problems.  5 Applications of Blockchain into IoT Networks  The Internet of Things is distributed into many domains, each concerned with a particular type of devices and their applications. This section discusses the potential applications of Blockchain into these subdomains of IoT.  Internet of Vehicles  IoV : The IoV is deﬁned as a distributed network of vehicles and their peripherals that allow the intercommunication and exchange of information between vehicles and entities such as roads, trafﬁc lights, humans, or other vehicles. Signiﬁcant research has seen the application of Blockchain into IoV.  Huang et al.  In the work [12], the authors have proposed a Blockchain model named LNSC. This model uses elliptic curve cryptography  ECC  for calculation of hash functions. The work in [14] presents a Blockchain-based decentralized structure that removes third parties. The veriﬁcation and authentication of transfer processes are looked after by a security manager network. A Blockchain-based reputation system has been devised in the work [15], which is capable of classifying the received messages as true or false based on the sender’s reputation scores.  The work in [16] presents PETCON, a localized peer-to-peer electricity trading system. PETCON allows locals transactions of electricity between the electric vehi- cles connected in a smart grid. It eliminates trusted third parties for the trade of electricity between the vehicles.  Internet of healthcare things: IoT has already seen a lot of applications in health care [8]. IoT in health care has provided means for the clinical data in the form of Electronic Health Records  EMRs  to be fed into the system in a portable form for use. The work [17] presents a system, which is defended against selective predicate attacks. The use of Blockchain and IoT in healthcare has provided means for the pro- tection of integrity, maintaining the privacy of patient EMRs, and their immutability. The work [18] provides a system based on a consortium Blockchain, which instan- tiates blocks when new healthcare data for a particular patient is created. This block is distributed to all nodes in the patient network and is inserted into the chain only after veriﬁcation by a majority of the nodes. This achieves a global view of the patient’s history in an efﬁcient way. This system exploits the immutable nature of blockchain and can easily detect changes in healthcare data.  The cloud as a potential platform: In the work [19], the authors discuss fog and cloud as potential platforms for hosting Blockchain. A set of experiments performed on IBM’s Bluemix Blockchain show the network latency as a dominant factor in the performance analysis.  Implementations in a smart city network: The work [20] proposes a security framework based on Blockchain for a smart city’s communication network. It is shown that a Blockchain-based implementation is resilient to many threats observed   On the Role of Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things  139  in traditional communication networks. Blockchain will provide a common platform open to all smart devices in the city’s network, enabling them secure communication on a decentralized environment.  Applications of blockchain in the industry: The authors of work [21] present a Blockchain Platform for Industrial Internet of Things  BPIIoT . Applications of this platform are described, such as on-demand manufacturing, which enables users to transact directly with machines. This is made possible by the platform by providing Blockchain accounts to every machine and allowing the users to avail manufactur- ing services on demand. The BPIIoT platform also provides applications, such as traceability, smart diagnostics, and supply chain tracking.  6 Conclusion  This chapter provides an extensive view of the characteristics of Blockchain with in-depth explanations of its workings and different applications. The signiﬁcance of Blockchain with IoT is highlighted through examples of cryptocurrencies and other projects. The security issues in the ﬁeld of IoT are also discussed with implications of Blockchain being a potential solution. It has been observed that integrating the functionalities of Blockchain with IoT networks provides an effective solution to security and data privacy issues. Blockchain also provides mutual trust between the parties and eliminates the possibilities of malicious data manipulations. This chapter also concludes with the fact that private blockchain are more likely to become feasible solutions in terms of scalability in different devices called Things in IoT. There are many areas, such as trust management and data processing, which still needs more attention with respect to implementing the concept of Blockchain.  References  1.

Miraz  Abstract Blockchain, as well as Internet of Things  IoT , is considered as two major disruptive emerging technologies. However, both of them suffer from innate tech- nological limitations to some extent. IoT requires strengthening its security features while Blockchain inherently possesses them due to its extensive use of cryptographic mechanisms and Blockchain––in an inverted manner–– needs contributions from the distributed nodes for its P2P  Peer-to-Peer  consensus model while IoT rudimentarily embodies them within its architecture.

Keywords Blockchain· Blockchain of Things  BCoT · Internet of things  IoT · Wireless Sensor Network  WSN · Security  1 Introduction  Both Blockchain and Internet of Things  IoT  are the two major disruptive emerging constituents of the contemporary Internet-enabled era of technology. As per Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies 2018 [32], both of these technologies are currently in their ‘peak of inﬂated expectations’ while both are projected to highly likely require another ‘5–10 years’ to mature. In fact, comparing with the Gartner’s [15] predictions, Blockchain-without changing much-hovered at its current ongoing position on the hype cycle. On the contrary, the locus of IoT has progressed rea- sonably—prevailing within the same arc  i.e. peak of inﬂated expectations  of the curve—moving downwards crossing the pinnacle—however, IoT pedalled back on the level of maturity from ‘2–5 years’ to the current state of ‘5–10 years’. Such regres- sion of IoT, in terms of reaching maturity level, however, is justiﬁed by its widespread adoption in multifaceted applications and the security concerns raised thus far. In M. H.

Miraz  fact, both of these technologies are distributed, autonomous and mostly decentralised systems possessing connatural potentials to act as complementary to each other. IoT requires strengthening its security features while Blockchain inherently possesses them due to its extensive use of cryptographic mechanisms and Blockchain—in an inverted manner—needs contributions from the distributed nodes for its P2P  Peer- to-Peer  consensus model while IoT rudimentarily embodies them within its archi- tecture. This chapter, therefore, acutely dissects the viability, along with prospective challenges, of incorporating Blockchain with IoT technologies—inducing the notion of Blockchain of Things  BCoT —as well as the beneﬁts such consolidation can offer.  1.1 Introduction to Blockchain  The concept of Blockchain was ﬁrst fully conceived as enabling technology for Bit- coin cryptosystem, as introduced in 2008 by a mysterious character called Nakamoto [64]. However, expeditiously—within a very short span of time—Blockchain, for its wide possibility to be applied in multifaceted applications, has signiﬁcantly proved its distinctiveness as a standalone technology. In fact, it can be argued that the Blockchain itself is not a new technology; it is rather a new concept of using different existing technologies in an incorporated approach [23].  Blockchain is a type of Distributed Ledger  Also known as Shared Ledger or Distributed Ledger Technology, DLT —a shared database chronologically recording transactions––literally any sort and form of data—in a tamper-proof digital ledger with timestamp. Blockchain ecosystem signiﬁcantly utilises mathematical hashing and cryptographic asymmetric key encryption mechanisms for data security—along with P2P node based consensus approach for immutability. A brief operational description of Blockchain ecosystem has been presented at Sect. 2.  1.2 Introduction to IoT  The phrase ‘The Internet of Things’, more commonly known as ‘IoT’, was ﬁrst reportedly coined by one of the co-founders of MIT’s Auto-ID Lab, namely ‘Kevin Ashton’ far back in 1999. The term ‘Internet of Objects’ is often used interchange- ably. IoT ecosystem connects myriad of ‘things’ or ‘objects’, i.e. electronic or electrical devices—of different types, size, capabilities and characteristics—through the Internet. The principal aim is to maximise the beneﬁts of data—in terms of practical usefulness as well as monetary gains by analysing and utilising in decision-making process—collected by various sensors and or actuators embedded in different physical objects including machines. The major share of connectivity in any IoT ecosystem is mainly facilitated by a number of short-range wireless tech- nologies such as ZigBee, Radio-Frequency Identiﬁcation  RFID , Ultra-wideband  UWB  radio technology, sensor networks and through location-based technologies   Blockchain of Things  BCoT : The Fusion of Blockchain …  143  [14]. In fact, the latitude of such connections is continually extending beyond the scope of basic machine-to-machine  M2M  communication [3]. There are multifarious IoT devices available. Examples include Smart toys, Wearables  e.g. Smartwatches, glasses, etc. , Smart appliances  such as Smart TVs, Smart speakers, Smart Bulbs , Smart metres such as thermostats, commercial security systems and Smart city technologies  such as those used to monitor trafﬁc and weather conditions . IoT applications are also multifarious in nature. Many IoT ecosystems, performing various different tasks, have been developed thus far. Examples of such IoT-enabled systems include: Nest Smart Home, DHL’s IoT Tracking and Monitoring System, CISCO’s ‘Planetary Skin’—a global ‘nervous system’, Smart Grid and Intelligent Vehicles, Smart Firms, Smart Schools and so forth. In fact, the scope of IoT applications has always been expanding since it was ﬁrst implemented. Figure 1 demonstrates how various heterogeneous networks can be connected through IoT—a ‘network of networks’ [12] making the Internet even pervasive.  Apart from the wide range of standard networking protocols, domains and applications [16] deployed in IoT ecosystems, IoT devices suffer from lack of standardisation, especially in terms of how they are connected to the Internet. However, this inhibiting factor is expected to be addressed in the near future.  Fig. 1 IoT connecting ever-expanding heterogeneous networks [27, 28]   144  M. H. Miraz  1.3 Application of Blockchain in IoT  Blockchain and IoT—as standalone technologies—have already proved them to be highly disruptive.  Since IoT highly utilises the existing wireless sensor network  WSN  technolo- gies, intrinsically it remains vulnerable to privacy as well as security threats. On the contrary, blockchain, by its design and architecture––consensus method and cryptographic techniques—is considered as a Trust Machine [31]. Thus, it possesses the potentials to address the major share of the security issues found in IoT. Miraz and Ali [22] argues them to be complementary technologies to each other: BC requires participating nodes for consensus approach which can be supplemented by IoT devices while IoT requires security features which can be met by BC such as transparency, privacy, immutability, operational resilience and so forth.  IoT is a cyber-physical system which helps to represent the ‘connected’ physical world into part of a substantial realm of information system—the cyber world. However, due to various reasons, the security aspects of IoT has not been properly addressed at the design phase of the devices and products. With the advent and increasing popularity of BC, there has been a paradigm shift in IoT research, partic- ularly integrating IoT and BC [36, 38] together for a more robust but secure cyber world. However, since the technologies are still not fully mature, many challenges are yet to be addressed as emerged from such integration [35]. Many studies [18, 19] suggest applications of BC as a probable solution to tightening the security aspects of the IoT ecosystem including the presentation of ‘Stalker’ [18] attack.  Since IoT is built on the foundation laid by wireless sensor network  WSN  [7], characteristically each node of an IoT ecosystem is considered to be prone to attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service  DDoS  [5, 29] and if compromised may serve as a point of failure.  IoT networks are mostly leveraged on a cloud environment. Such a centralised architecture suffers from Single Point of Failure  SPF  and further adds to vulnera- bility.  IoT devices gather and or generate a vast amount of data which are communicated over the Internet for processing and decision-making purposes. Data privacy and authentication is considered to be a constant critical threat for IoT environment. In the absence of proper security measures, these vast amounts of data can be mishandled and used inappropriately [37]. It is thus extremely important to safeguard the IoT system from injection attacks. As the name implies, an injection attack tries to inject false data or measures into the system and thus affect the overall decision-making process.   Blockchain of Things  BCoT : The Fusion of Blockchain …  145  1.4 Challenges in Integrating Blockchain in IoT  It is evident that the notion of Blockchain of Things  BCoT —by creating a fusion of blockchain and IoT technologies, is capable of bringing a paradigm shift in how these technologies are currently being used. Both the technologies can, in fact, beneﬁt from each other in a reciprocal manner. However, integrating them together is not a straightforward matter. Many technological as well as architectural issues are yet to be solved for seamless integration. For instance, blockchain’s Proof-of-Work  PoW  consensus approach may not be a good ﬁt for IoT environment as it demands both computing power and electric energy to a great extent. Alternative approaches such as variants of Proof-of-Stake  PoS , Proof-of-Activity  PoA , Proof-of-Space Capacity  PoC  are being designed, developed and implemented. Blockchain’s capped latency and lower transaction throughput is another hurdle in its way to be applied in IoT environment. However, the recent invention of Lightning Network  LN  and similar other technologies hold great promises to address this issue. Per contra, IoT devices highly suffer from scarce processing capabilities and lack of storage systems. In addition to the recent advancement in IoT devices, offshoring some processing- and storage-related functions to the cloud mitigate the problem to some extent. These challenges and status of recent developments in this regard have been discussed in Sect. 4 in more details.  2 Blockchain Fundamentals  2.1 Distributed Digital Ledger  In a blockchain ecosystem, there are mainly two types of nodes: full node and lightweight node. While the full nodes preserve the complete blockchain, lightweight nodes only download the headers of each block rather than the complete block. A lightweight node can also take part in the veriﬁcation and consensus approach via connecting to a full node using Simpliﬁed Payment Veriﬁcation  SPV . Thus, down- loading and storage requirement for a lightweight node is signiﬁcantly reduced, however, this requires a lightweight node to place its ‘trust’ on the associated full node instead.  Therefore, all  full  nodes are intrinsically complete ledgers—they hold and have access to data of the whole blockchain data containing the complete transaction history in the chain. As stated in Sect. 1.1, blockchain is thus seemingly a Distributed Ledger  also known as Shared Ledger or Distributed Ledger Technology, DLT —a shared but tamper-proof digital ledger  database  of chronologically recorded timestamped transactions or data. These transactions data, organised in blocks, are linked through the protocol along with hashing and consensus. Analogous to a   146  M. H. Miraz  ledger, an existing block cannot be deleted or modiﬁed as doing so will invalidate the ‘chain’ of hashes. Like other ledgers, a DLT is append-only—allowing to add new blocks at the open end of the chain by any participating or permissioned node. The process is controlled by the protocol via consensus approach without the need for any central authority.  One major advantage of this distributed approach is eliminating the single point of failure  SPF  as if one of the nodes becomes unavailable or compromised, the network shall still be functioning without any disruptions. Data are chronologically recorded in the ledger, thus it becomes easily veriﬁable. The decentralised approach, along with mathematical hashing provides immutability and transparency. DLT is also considered to be highly suitable for non-monetary transactions, especially for securities settlement. It is advocated that application of DLT can help bringing ‘direct’ holding of securities and eliminate market fragmentation while bringing complete transparency in the settlement and clearing process [9, 25].  2.2 Variations of Blockchain  Considering the permutation and combination of the read and write accesses assigned to the nodes, Blockchain ecosystems can be categorised into three different consensus models, viz., public  permission less , private  permissioned  and hybrid  consortium .  Public  Permissionless  In a public or permisionless blockchain ecosystem, anyone at any time and from any- where in the world, having a computing device, can act as a participating node––join- ing and leaving the network at his or her own will. A node, willing to participate, has to install a small prototype which deﬁnes the consensus and other relevant rules. In most cases, all the nodes have both read and write access. However, nodes may opt out to be a ‘full node’—a node that keeps a copy of the ‘complete’ ledger. Bitcoin’s Blockchain is an example of the public Blockchain ecosystem.  Private  Permissioned  In a private or permissioned blockchain ecosystem, only ‘permitted’ or ‘invited’ nodes can be part of the network. These trusted nodes usually have both read and write access. However, a role-based policy or even speciﬁc node based approach can also be applied. Multichain is an example of the private blockchain.  Hybrid Ahybrid blockchain, as the name implies, is a combination of both public and pri- vate models. While read access is usually left open for any participating nodes as in public blockchain, write access is rather conﬁned to some speciﬁc nodes. The consensus is predominantly controlled by a group of predeﬁned ‘trusted’ nodes. Hybrid Blockchain can be considered as the best version of both the models, how- ever, implementation decision should be based on the domains as well as the type   Blockchain of Things  BCoT : The Fusion of Blockchain …  147  of the applications. For example, hybrid blockchain may be a good choice for stock exchanges while public blockchain for cryptocurrencies [23].  Based on the history of the evolution of this technology, Blockchain can further  be categorised into four different versions thus far: Blockchain 1.0 The cryptocurrency , as introduced by Nakamoto in [64], is predominantly known as Blockchain 1.0. This sort of blockchain or DLT facilitates Internet-based ﬁnancial transactions by enabling cryptocurrencies—the ‘Internet of Money’.  blockchain  bitcoin  behind  type  of  Blockchain 2.0 As a rule of thumb, blockchains supporting smart contracts are largely known as Blockchain 2.0. Analogous to contracts, smart contracts—as coined by Nick Szabo in 1994 [39]—are programmable digital contracts enabled by turing complete lan- guage. In its simplest form, smart contracts are autonomous computer programmes that can automatically execute if the predeﬁned set of rules or conditions are met. These rules may include validation, veriﬁcation, facilitation, administration of the execution of a contract and so forth. A vending machine is the oldest known example of materialising smart contract. In Blockchain 2.0, the smart contracts reside in the chain or DLT and thus inherit the built-in securities features that a blockchain can offer. Therefore, Blockchain 2.0 based smart contracts, along with security, offer vari- ability and transparency. Ethereum Blockchain is the leading Smart contrast enabled blockchain ecosystem. Blockchain 3.0 Blockchain 3.0 supports the operation of Decentralised Applications  DApp , elimi- nating Single Point of Failure  SPF —as seen in traditional centralised applications. DApps adopt decentralisation both in storage and communication aspects, there- fore, the backend code of DApps are mostly run on blockchain ecosystems—decen- tralised peer-to-peer networks, while traditional apps utilise centralised servers to serve this purpose. Ethereum Swarm is an example of decentralised storage infras- tructure allowing frontend code of DApps to host and run. Blockchain 4.0 Blockchain 4.0—based on the foundations already laid by its preceding variants— enables utilisation of the advent of blockchain technology in various applications, solutions, approaches and business models, especially in the realm of ‘industry 4.0’  cyber-physical systems . The pre-eminent driving force of Industry 4.0 is bringing complete automation in every phase of production systems [30]. Such automation requires seamless integration of multifaceted execution systems as well as the imple- mentation of enterprise resource planning  ERP —demanding highly reliable privacy protection and consensus model. This is where both IoT and blockchain kicks in— IoT providing the infrastructure for automation while blockchain acting as the ‘Trust Machine’ [21]. Recent advent of atomic cross-chain swap and lighting network [24], is likely to accelerate the whole automation process of Industry 4.0 by a degree of great extent as it will enable swapping of IoT-generated data on various Blockchain 4.0 applications on different platforms.   148  2.3 PoW Versus PoS  M. H. Miraz  As per the blockchain architecture, it is obvious that the consensus approach is required to verify and validate the transaction and then assemble them in a block for chaining with the existing ledger. The ﬁnal step is basically sealing a newly built block incorporating some or all from a pool of veriﬁed but unconﬁrmed transactions. This process involves calculating the hash of the block for making it immutable and veriﬁable in the future. To avoid ‘double spending’ of the same coin, the process requires ‘someone’ to have the authority to seal a block for addition at some given point of time. There are various algorithms, such as Proof-of-Work  PoS  and Proof- of-Stake  PoS  to determine this ‘someone’ by the protocol, rather than any central administrator.  PoW is the most commonly used algorithm, as ushered by Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners, who operate full bitcoin nodes, pull some transactions from the pool of unconﬁrmed transactions, add a new coin base transaction to oneself to create a new coin as per the mining reward rate of that given time, add a nonce and then calculate the block hash. That being said, the hash has to solve the mathematical puzzle, i.e. it has to smaller than a given threshold more commonly known as the ‘difﬁculty level’. If the ﬁrst hash, calculated by a particular miner, do not satisfy the difﬁculty-level threshold, the nonce is changed, usually by adding one to it, and repeatedly calculated until the satisfying solution is found—similar to a brute force approach. Whoever ﬁnds the solution ﬁrst, amongst all the miners, is the winner and receives the newly created coin. Thus, analogous to gold mining, the process of completing the PoW is known as mining too. Once the satisfying hash is found, it is broadcasted to the network, other nodes then verify it and if found to be legitimate, the block is then added to their existing chain and they start working on forming a new block by repeating the same procedure. It is possible that two different miners produce valid hashes at the same or nearly same time. In that case, the ‘longest chain’ rule shall be applied to avoid any fork. The difﬁculty level is also automatically adjusted by the Bitcoin protocol to keep it approximately 10 min on average. The overall PoW consensus approach, as well as this capped latency, thus contribute to high latency which is one of the major impediments of blockchain adoption. High demand for computing power as well as electricity is another major issue for which PoW and mining is highly critiqued. Considering the limited computing power of IoT devices, PoW is not a good ﬁt for the fusion of blockchain and IoT technologies—Blockchain of Things  BCoT , where IoT devices act as participating nodes.  Proof-of-Stake  PoS  is an alternative approach to PoW. In PoS, instead of solving the cryptographic puzzle as part of mining competition, the amount of stake  wealth, cryptocurrency  a node possesses, incorporated with algorithms for randomisation, is considered while determining the creator of the next block. The more wealth stake a node posses, the higher is the possibility for being selected as the creator of the next block. While it is argued that PoS is more suitable, at least considering its currents state of development, for non-monetary applications of blockchain, DASH cryptocur- rency has already adopted this approach and Ethereum has included in its future devel-   Blockchain of Things  BCoT : The Fusion of Blockchain …  149  opment roadmap. While PoS is considered to be less secure than PoW, it is more eco- friendly as it produces less Electronic Waste  E-Waste  and produces comparatively very less Green House Gas Emission  GHGE  by consuming less electricity [26].  There are now few other emerging approaches, as alternatives to PoW, such as Proof-of-Activity  PoA , Proof-of-Burn  PoB , Proof-of-Capacity Space  PoC  and Transactions as Proof-of-Stake  TaPoS . However, mostly all of these alternatives are prone to centralisation stands against the decentralisation notion of bitcoin, i.e. to function as a ‘Trust Machine’ through shifting the trust to a decentralised network from the third-party intermediaries.  2.4 Beneﬁts of Blockchain  Based on Blockchain’s architecture and functionalities, it is evident that blockchain offers the following beneﬁts:  Decentralisation: The ﬁrst and foremost beneﬁts of blockchain it operates in a dis- tributed network and the ledger is replicated in all the participating nodes. Therefore, all other beneﬁts of blockchain are mainly derived from its decentralisation nature. Transparency: Since transactions are recorded and timestamped in a decentralised ledger, blockchain transactions are completely transparent. Blockchain made ver- iﬁcation of transaction further effortless through the application of Merkle Tree. Another important aspect of transparency is that the ledger can be precisely tracked back along the chain, authoritatively as well as accurately, to its point of origin.  Security: Since the ledger is distributed, SPF is eliminated. Furthermore, consen- sus approach, such as PoW, and longest chain rule makes the blockchain network protected from DDoS by capturing 51% or more nodes.  Immutability: Since all the timestamped records of transactions are linked by mathematical hashing, altering one single transaction in the chain invalidates not only the hash of block it belongs to but also the hashes of all other blocks generated after that particular block. Per contra, a replica of the chain is distributed on all the nodes of the network which provides veriﬁability—making the chain completely immutable. The ledger being append-only adds an extra layer of immutability as the existing record on the ledger can neither be deleted nor altered.  Cost: For large-scale applications, deploying blockchain could be well of legacy technologies and will need less maintenance—making blockchain an economical and affordable solution in the long run. On small-scale private application, it may be expensive to deploy blockchain as it requires a distributed network to operate. However, various Blockchain as a Service  BaaS , quite a lot of which are even cloud based, offered by many third-party platforms, such as Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc. can be utilised for offshoring purposes.  Smart Contracts: As discussed in Sect. 2.1, smart contracts and Decentralised Applications  DApp  are now acting as a catalyst for blockchain adoption in various domains, including non-monetary ones. Smart contract enables pre-setting condi- tions on the blockchain. If the predeﬁned condition or set of conditions are met, the blockchain system automatically triggers the transactions or materialise the contracts.   150  M. H. Miraz  Lightning Network In a Lightning Network  LN , Hashed Timelock Contract.  HTLC-based smart contract enables direct bi-directional transactions to take place between two parties. The intermediate transactions in LN network take place in a second layer—built on top of the base layer of any blockchain ecosystem. These transactions are not subject to consensus, hence instantaneous. However, upon leav- ing the LN, the ﬁnal resultant balance is broadcasted to the base layer network for consensus and settlement. Utilising onion-style routing, the scope of transactions in lighting networks can be expanded beyond directly connected peers.  Micropayment Drivers of Future Business Models: With the advent of smart contract and lightning network supported by blockchain, Lightning Applications  LApps  and truly afford- able micropayment systems have emerged. These are now acting as drivers of future business models—by prompting innovation and nurturing new venture creations.  3 IoT Fundamentals  3.1 Internet of Everything, Things and Nano-things   IoE, IoT and IoNT   It has been observed that the terms Internet of Everything  IoE  and Internet of Things  IoT  are often inappropriately used interchangeably. This is thus very important to distinguish between IoE and IoT. In fact, both Qualcomm and Cisco have been using the term IoE [13, 40]. However, while Qualcomm’s connotation of IoE has been overridden by IoT by a majority of others, Cisco’s interpretation is much more comprehensive. Cisco deﬁnitions of IoE comprises of ‘four pillars’: people, data, process and things, where ‘things’ characterise IoT [13, 40], refer to the Fig. 2.  With the advent of modern communication technologies, the detached, non- networked and solitary multifaceted devices of the past are now increasingly being connected through the Internet, including person-to person  P2P  systems, person- to-machine  P2M  and even machine-to-machine  M2M  connectivity. The complete notion of IoE thus envelops people, processes, data and things together—in a close association, as shown in Fig. 2. Consequently, IoE innately supplements, enhances and broadens both industrial and business processes to enrich people’s lives.  Further to the introduction of IoT in Sect. 1.2, a conventional IoT ecosystem comprises of ﬁve distinct components—functioning in a way that involves mutual assistance in working towards a common goal. These components are as follows:   1  Sensors: The sensors mainly functions as ‘input devices’ which collect as well  as transduce the data they sense;   2  Computing Node: The computing node is mainly a processor—to further process  the information and data received from a sensor;   Blockchain of Things  BCoT : The Fusion of Blockchain …  151  Fig. 2 Internet of Everything  IoE , things and nano-things [27]   3  Receiver: The role of the receivers involves collecting the message or data sent  by the computing nodes or any other associated devices;   4  Actuator: The actuator is primarily responsible for triggering the associated device to perform the desired function as instructed by the computing node— based on its decision deduced by processing and analysing the data and infor- mation gathered from the sensors and or the Internet;   5  Device: The devices ‘actually’ perform the desired task s  as and when triggered  by the actuators.  The notion of the Internet of Nano-things  IoNT  is fundamentally a genre of Internet of Things  IoT —standard sensors being replaced by nanosensors. IoNT embodies nanosensors in multifaceted objects with the advent of nanonetworks. IoNT possesses signiﬁcant potentials to highly beneﬁt healthcare sectors by enabling access to healthcare data from various in situ places of the human or animal body which were inaccessible in the past due to the comparatively ‘large’ size of the sensors. In fact, in an IoNT ecosystem, the functional endeavours, i.e. sensing or actuation is to be performed by a ‘nano-machine’ of dimensions ranging from one to 100 nanometre  nm , utilising nano-antennas operating at Terahertz frequencies. It is likely that IoNT is due to bring better medical diagnostics [2]. Considering the potentials of IoNT in the healthcare sector, the nanosensors in Fig. 2 has been placed inside the ‘people’ box even though the nano-sensors are mainly small-scale sensors.   152  3.2 Challenges of IoT  M. H. Miraz  Due to architectural limitations, the major challenges of IoT includes sustainable source of energy, scarce processing capability and security. There are many other limitations of IoT which needs to be addressed are meticulous. Such challenges of IoT includes  but not limited to : deployment of IPv6, lack of standardisation, pervasiveness of IoT applications as well as devices, retroﬁtting IoT devices with additional sensors, lack of scalability to meet multifaceted exponential growths, amalgamating with the software-deﬁned networks  SDN  paradigm, to meet the increasing demand for performance requirement of edge computing  fog , inherent limitations of current wireless sensor networks  WSNs , ethical and legal issues— especially those related to data ownership and data residency, identity management of connected devices while enabling automated discovery, meeting future database and data management stipulations [27, 28]. In fact, it was difﬁcult to predict the widespread adoption of IoT at the initial phase of development, therefore, not much attention has been given at the design phase of the devices. This ignorance has resulted in the huge challenges IoT is facing at this stage.  3.3 IoT Security  It is apparent that one of the primary challenges IoT has to overcome is the draw- backs associated with security, privacy and vulnerability aspects. IoT systems highly suffer from SPF vulnerability due to their cloud-based centralised conﬁguration. IoT also suffers from device authentication and data conﬁdentiality. If proper security measures are not in place, IoT systems can be compromised and used inappropriately. It is pertinent to protect IoT systems from any attacks such as DDoS and injection attacks. While DDoS aims to disrupt regular legitimate trafﬁc of a targeted network, server or service, injection attacks aim to disrupt decision-making by injecting false measures in the data. Both availability and data integrity is extremely important for any real-time and life-critical applications such as health care, vehicular networks, etc. Thus creating trust amongst IoT devices is extremely important and considered as a signiﬁcant challenge. However, the application of blockchain can signiﬁcantly improve IoT security in this regard. Blockchain can offer IoT the required mechanism to achieve publicly veriﬁable audit trail through  device  authentication and  data  hashing techniques used blockchain ecosystems. This can thus help to solve the problem of non-repudiation to a great extent.   Blockchain of Things  BCoT : The Fusion of Blockchain …  153  4 Application of Blockchain for Enhanced IoT Security  The beneﬁts BC can offer, such as security, transparency, immutability, veriﬁability as well as the smart contract and the LN-based ones, possess the capability the limita- tions of IoT ecosystem if combined together with BC. Per contra, IoT also possesses the capability to beneﬁt BC by actively participating at the consensus process. In the Blockchain of Things  BCoT —the fusion of BC and IoT technologies—both can beneﬁt from each other in a reciprocal manner. This section will present a detailed literature survey covering a wide range of projects and research on the integration of BC and IoT, i.e. the BCoT notion.  In fact, due to the mushrooming popularity of both BC and IoT, many researchers around the globe are now trying to innovate different ways of BC-IoT integration for developing highly secure but robust Information Technology  IT  systems and addressing the technical as well as other associated problems. The works of Sun et al. [38], Samaniego and Deters [36], Reyna et al. [35] and Atzori [1] are worth mentioning in this regard. Many studies [18, 19] suggest applications of BC as a probable solution to tightening the security aspects of IoT ecosystem including the presentation of ‘Stalker’ [18] attack.  Another research on studying the advantages and disadvantages of application of BC in IoT, by Christidis and Devetsikiotis [6], introduces a taxonomy of BC topolo- gies for this purpose. In fact, several divergent abstractions have been introduced with Proof-of-Concept  PoC  prototypes. Examples of such PoC include: application of blockchain together with InterPlanetary File System  IPFS  for upgrading ﬁrmware of IoT devices by utilising smart contracts, framework for generating cash ﬂow by facilitating resource [20] or data [34] trading.  The Filament1 research projects involve designing and developing a wireless net- work cable of controlling ‘any’ system—ranging from street bulbs of a city to bur- glar alarm system of any ofﬁce. That being said, the projects highly focus on the use of blockchain and smart contract to enable smart devices  such as sensors, smart refrigerator, smart TV or any other smart appliances  to interact with each other via seamless Machine-to-Machine  M2M  communications including discovering and exchanging messages—autonomously, without being controlled by any cen- tral authority. However, for every communication taking place, the devices have to authenticate themselves, by either Transport Layer Security  TLS  or Secure Socket Layer  SSL  protocols, for security purposes, could be using public-key infrastructure  PKI . Another such M2M intercommunication model amongst smart IoT devices utilising blockchain as the backbone was proposed by Prabhu and Prabhu [33]. In this proposed model, the IP addresses of the devices as a key for accessing information stored in a DLT or blockchain.  With regard to access control, most of the established Access Control Lists  ACLs  and authentication approaches for traditional networks do not ﬁt well in an IoT environment. This is mainly because of the centralised nature of ACLs and similar approaches such as Discretionary Access Control  DAC , Mandatory Access Control  1https:  ﬁlament.com .   154  M. H. Miraz   MAC  and Attribute-Based Access Control  ABAC . To address these problems, a model was proposed by Deters [8], to perform access control in an IoT environment utilising the statistics extracted from the access patterns, along with blockchain and smart contract.  A multi-tier architecture of BCoT security and privacy model has been proposed by Dorrie et al. [10, 11] eliminating the shortcomings of BC as well as other tradi- tional approaches. A similar level of conﬁdentiality and data integrity was achieved without the use of PoW. Their system is designed based on three different layers: smart home, overlay network and cloud storage. Apart from smart devices, the smart home also has a miner who governs the blockchain as well as the data access poli- cies. When a new device  node  is added to the smart home ecosystem, the miner creates and adds a new block corresponding to the newly added node. In fact, the newly added block possesses dual-header, i.e. block header containing a link to the preceding block while and policy header deﬁnes the data access rule and authority. For facilitating secure communication amongst the devices shared keys are used— created and distributed utilising Difﬁe–Hellman algorithm, governed by the miner. A smart device, in this system, can store the data either on local storage system by employing a shared key or on a cloud storage by sending a request to the miner will then trigger a transaction on the public blockchain—the transaction is signed with the device’s key and contains addresses of the cloud storage system. Thus, the proposed BCoT architecture provides ﬁvefold security- and privacy-related beneﬁts:  1  conﬁdentiality through the use of shared private key encryption,  2  integrity through hashing,  3  availability by limiting allowed transactions,  4  user control by blockchain technology, and  5  authorisation by applying authorisation policies along with utilising shared key.  Wörner and Bomhard [41] developed a BCoT system enabling network sensors to trade and exchange data for Bitcoins in a self-governing fashion. Nodes’ addresses are the same as public keys on the Bitcoin network. Sensor nodes are discoverable via sensor repository. If a client would like to receive data from a sensor node, the client has to send transaction  including payment in Bitcoin  addressed to the public key of the corresponding sensor. The sensor node will then send a response transaction  including data  to the public key of the client. The delivery of the data in such scenarios can be processed through smart contracts. An alternative approach of using Bitcoin or similar altcoins could be using IOTA—a cryptocurrency using no blocks and no miners while facilitating micropayments [17].  Chakraborty et al. [4] have recently advocated a two-layered architecture to address the security as well as resource-constrained aspects of IoT nodes. The nodes having a limited resource for enforcing security measures are clustered together in layer 0. Per contra, other primary and secondary nodes are congregated in level N— while the primary nodes take care of the relevant processing, the secondary nodes mainly assist the primary nodes in this regard. The resource limitations of the nodes in layer 0 prevent them from communicating directly with other layer 0 devices, however, this rather achieved via level N devices instead.

This is because of the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Eternium. The cryp- tocurrencies manage the transactions of the users as a set of blocks in a ledger using cryptography techniques. In these systems, peer-to-peer networks are used to manage communications among users. These networks are also used to update the ledger in a fully distributed fashion. In other words, the technology of peer- to-peer networks plays a key role in the architecture of the blockchain. There- fore, issue in designing blockchain architecture is to determine the required technologies and applications of peer-to-peer networks. The second issue is to organize a well-deﬁned application development process for blockchain archi- tecture. The last issue is to identify the key participants in the blockchain environ- ments. In this section, we discuss the mentioned issues.  Keywords Blockchain architecture· Peer-to-Peer networks· Development  the ﬁrst  process  1 Blockchain Architecture  The blockchain architecture is based on peer-to-peer networks [1]. Distributed and self-organized computation are two main characteristics of these networks which are deployed by the blockchain architecture [1]. Recently, different technologies of peer- to-peer networks have been widely used in designing novel applications of blockchain technology. Therefore, being familiar with these networks is vital for managing blockchain architecture. This chapter is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the peer-to- peer networking concept is studied. Section 3 is dedicated to analyze the blockchain application development processes. Section 4 summarizes the architecture and design A. M.

In the last section, we present the conclusions.  2 Peer-to-Peer  P2P  Networking  Increasing the processing power of computers together with decreasing the price of computers resulted in the appearance of distributed systems some of which are shown in Fig. 1. One type of these systems is peer-to-peer networks. These networks were introduced in 2001 by appearing the Napster system, which allowed the sharing of audio ﬁles on the Internet. In the last decade, the client–server systems have changed and the incentive to use the power of small computers has created a unique model which we call it peer-to-peer networks. These systems are also known as opposite to client–server systems because there is no central server in them  Fig. 2 .  Peer-to-peer networks are referred to as distributed systems based on the exchange of information between peers, without dependence on a speciﬁc point in the system. In these systems, all peers are considered equal  client and server . The peers are connected together for the purpose of sharing devices, information, or data. In these networks, all peers communicate directly with each other.  Fig. 1 Evolution of distributed computing and related concepts over time [2]   Blockchain Architecture  Fig. 2 Client–server system versus peer-to-peer system  peer  peer  client  163  client  client  peer  client  peer  peer  server  Peer-to-peer networks have unique characteristics that make it possible to classify a distributed system into a category of these networks. As mentioned in [3, 4], some of these characteristics are given below.  cid:129  The symmetric role: Each peer has both client role and server role. In other words, when installing the associated parts of a peer-to-peer software, they will be installed and capable of running for the both roles.  cid:129  Scalability: The peer-to-peer networks scale can be similar in size to millions, and in other words, this deﬁnition is the most comprehensive deﬁnition of scalability, which includes the use of all processing power available on the Internet. The traditional distributed systems do not emphasize on this level of scalability.  cid:129  Heterogeneously: Peer-to-peer networks from the point of view of hardware capa- bilities represent the concept of heterogeneity in some way. There is no emphasis on peers in terms of storage or processing resources.  cid:129  Distributed Control: In the most ideal case, there is no centralized control for managing these systems. This is a prominent feature of this kind of system.  cid:129  Dynamism: Peer-to-peer networks typically work in dynamic environments. The topology may change rapidly due to unstable connections among peers.  It should be noted that the scalability and dynamism of the outstanding features of the nets are such that the issues raised in this area cannot be categorized in the classical issues of distributed systems.  2.1 Classiﬁcations of Peer-to-Peer Networks  Considering topological characteristics of peer-to-peer networks, they can be classi- ﬁed into three classes [3]:  cid:129  Pure peer-to-peer networks  cid:129  Super-peer networks  cid:129  Hybrid networks   164  A. M. Saghiri  These classes are described in the next three paragraphs.  Pure peer-to-peer networks: In pure peer-to-peer networks, the network manage- ment algorithms are distributed among all peers. There are three different types for pure peer-to-peer networks: structured, unstructured, and hybrid.  cid:129  Unstructured peer-to-peer networks: In these networks, the peers do not follow any particular strategy to connect to each other and are completely randomly connected to each other and there is no central unit for coordination between these peers and the system is fully distributed. Any random graph can be used to represent the topology of these networks. In these networks such as Gnutella [5], and Freenet [6], there are some lightweight algorithms to manage the overlay topology. Unstructured peer-to-peer networks are widely used because their design is simple. Another application of unstructured peer-to-peer networks is when the changes in the network are high and maintaining a stable topology is not possible.  cid:129  Structured peer-to-peer networks: In structured peer-to-peer networks such as Chord [7], and CAN [8], distributed algorithms are provided to manage the overlay topology that can provide efﬁcient resource location algorithms. In structured peer- to-peer networks, any resource can be located within a bounded number of hops. An application of structured peer-to-peer networks is when the changes in the network are not high and maintaining a stable topology is useful.  cid:129  Semi-structured networks: considering dynamicity of the network different mod- els of the networks based on two above types of peer-to-peer networks may be created. Usually, a layer of an unstructured peer-to-peer network is used to gather information of the stable peer and another layer of a structured peer-to-peer net- work is used to connect the stable peers.  Super-peer networks: In super-peer networks, some peers are selected to manage the network. In these networks, each super-peer manages a set of peers.  cid:129  Nonadaptive super-peer selection algorithms: In these algorithms, the selection is performed locally at each peer without considering conditions of peers of the network. Because of simplicity, some of the peer-to-peer networks such as those reported in [9–14] utilize nonadaptive super-peer selection algorithms.  cid:129  Adaptive super-peer selection algorithms: In these algorithms such as those reported in [15–22], the super-peer selection algorithms select super-peers based on information about conditions of peers such as the number of peers, the com- putational power of peers, or the current load on super-peers in a self-organized manner. A group of adaptive super-peer selection algorithms such as those reported in [15, 18, 22, 23] uses the capacity of the peers where the capacity of a peer is computed based on properties such as bandwidth and computational capabilities of that peer.  Hybrid networks: every combination of pure and super-peer networks fall into this type of networks. In this type of networks, we may create a hierarchy of super- peer networks.   Blockchain Architecture  165  2.2 Management Mechanisms of Peer-to-Peer Networks  As it was previously mentioned, one of the important characteristics of peer-to-peer networks is dynamism. In these systems, the peers connect to the network without any particular order. In other words, network conditions are continually changing, and sometimes they will not be predictable, and if there are no effective management mechanisms in these networks, the network conditions will quickly lead to unac- ceptable conditions. This feature has a high impact on the design of management algorithms in these networks. Considering the mentioned issue, different approaches for designing management mechanisms are reported in the literature. Some of them are given in the rest of this section.  Biologically inspired approach: In peer-to-peer networks, an approach for design- ing management mechanisms utilizes biologically inspired self-organized models such as ant colony, growing neural gas, cellular automata, Schelling segregation model, and fungal growth model. This is because they have useful characteristics such as self-healing which leads to resilience to changes in the network. Note that, in peer-to-peer networks, the high rate of changes occurs which caused by joining or leaving peers. Some of the state-of-the-art biologically inspired algorithms are explained as follows. In [24, 25], ant colony algorithm is used to design management algorithms. In [18], the growth pattern of fungi is used to structure the management of super-peers. In [21], growing neural gas model is used to organize a management algorithm for super-peer based networks. In [26], the Schelling segregation model is used for managing the structure of the clusters in unstructured peer-to-peer networks. In [27], a search algorithm based on bacterial foraging strategy is used to manage a hierarchical unstructured peer-to-peer network. In [28], a search algorithm based on cellular automata for unstructured peer-to-peer networks is reported. Cellular automata model is a discrete mathematical model which was designated to model biological phenomena [29].  Reinforcement learning based approach: Because of extremely dynamic nature of peer-to-peer networks, a management algorithm is required which can handle decision-making process considering volatile, incomplete, and distributed informa- tion about peers of the network [3, 30]. Reinforcement learning is a ﬁeld of machine learning concerned with how to design an entity which is able to take appropriate actions in an unknown environment so as to maximize reward received from the environment [31]. Reinforcement algorithms such as learning automata [32], cellu- lar learning automata [33], and Q-Learning are widely used to design management algorithms in peer-to-peer networks. In [34, 35], adaptive algorithms form manag- ing clusters in peer-to-peer networks are reported. In [36–38] several algorithms are reported for managing the resource discovery process.  Cognitive networks approach: Recently, a type of management mechanisms in computer networks has been reported which is known as cognitive networking. A cognitive network is a network which can learn to improve its performance over time based on feedback received from the network. For the ﬁrst time, this approach   166  A. M. Saghiri  was used in radio networks [39, 40]. This approach has been used in other types of networks [41]. In [42], cognitive networking concept was used to design cognitive peer-to-peer networks.  Ontology and semantic web approach: An ontology involves a representation method, formal identiﬁcation, and deﬁnition of the classes, attributes, and rela- tions between the entities. This concept was used to present an indexing method for unstructured P2P networks in [43]. Ontology is also used to organize the struc- ture of peer-to-peer networks in [44].  Graph theory approach: A graph is a mathematical structure which is used to model mutual relations between nodes. It should be noted that the topology of peer-to-peer networks can be modeled by graphs. The theory of graphs is widely used in designing management algorithms in peer-to-peer networks. Some of these algorithms are reported in [45–47].  Game theory approach: Game theory is the study of mathematical modeling and analyses of strategic interaction among multiple rational decision makers. Game theory has been used to model the behavior of selﬁsh peers in P2P networks [48].  Heuristic and cross-layer optimization approach: Cross-layer optimization refers to optimization algorithms which utilize variables from all layers of the OSI communications model to improve the performance of the network. Since peer-to-peer networks operate over underlay networks, several problems should be solved considering the layered architecture of the peer-to-peer networks. One of these problems is the topology mismatch problem. In these networks, the mechanism of a peer randomly joining and leaving a network, causes a topology mismatch between the overlay and the underlying physical topology. Many algorithms are reported in [49, 50] to solve this problem.  2.3 Applications of Peer-to-Peer Networks  In the last decade, peer-to-peer networks are used as the infrastructure of a wide range of applications  Fig. 3 . Some of these applications are described below.  cid:129  File sharing: Many ﬁle sharing applications such as Torrent [51], eMule [52], and Gnutella [5] utilize peer-to-peer networks. A beneﬁt of these systems is that they don’t invest in expensive servers. These days, Torrent invests in a cryptocurrency called Tron.  cid:129  Video streaming: Recently, peer-to-peer streaming technologies have presented a revolutionized technology called  P2PTV  for streaming. In these technologies, each peer can start a streaming process. Some of well-known applications of this category are Zatoo [53], PPlive [54], Tribler [55], and LiveStation [56].  cid:129  Cloud computing: The traditional design of cloud systems were changed by peer- to-peer networks. Peer-to-peer cloud brings a scalable architecture for clouds [3].   Blockchain Architecture  167  Peer-to-Peer  Network  File Sharing  Video Streaming   Cloud  Computing  Grid Computing   Messaging System  DataBase  Search Engine  Storage  Anonymizing  Insurance  Web Hosting   Online Cash System  Bitcoin  Fig. 3 Applications of peer-to-peer networks   cid:129  Grid computing: A peer-to-peer network can be used as an infrastructure for sharing computational power. The aim of peer-to-peer grid is to provide easy access to large amounts of computational resources for every peer [3].  cid:129  Messaging system: Because the nature of server-less characteristic of peer-to-peer messaging systems, they have received much attention in a wide range of appli- cations. Tox [57] and Ricochet [58] are two examples of peer-to-peer messaging systems.  cid:129  Database: Peer-to-peer databases such as OrbitDB [59] and Barrel [60] support server-less and distributed databases.  cid:129  Search engine: Peer-to-peer search engines such as FAROO [61], and YaCy [62] are search engines that do not use central expensive servers.  cid:129  Storage: Peer-to-peer storage networks support storing and retrieving remote ﬁles among millions of peers [3, 63].   168  A. M. Saghiri   cid:129  Anonymizing: Utilizing cryptography, peer-to-peer anonymizing networks such as Tarzan [64], Freenet [6], and Tor [65] enable peer-to-peer communication with high anonymity.  cid:129  Insurance: Peer-to-peer insurance is a risk-sharing network. In this system, a group of persons pool their premiums together to insure against a risk [66].  cid:129  Web hosting: Peer-to-peer networking is used to distribute access to webpages in peer-to-peer web hosting [67].  cid:129  Online cash system: Bitcoin is a well-known online cash system that utilizes peer-to-peer networks [68]. There are many projects such as IOTA, Monero, and Ethereum similar to Bitcoin which try to manage the cryptocurrencies using peer- to-peer networks.  In a blockchain-based applications such as bitcoin, peer-to-peer networks are used to manage a ledger in a distributed manner. In these systems, the ledger can be seen as a shared memory with high security. Many distributed algorithms are developed for consensus, block management, and leader election for miners in the blockchain considering characteristics of peer-to-peer networks. It should be noted that blockchain technologies introduced new terms such as ledger, miners, smart contracts, POW  Proof-of-Work , and POS  Proof-of-Stake  for their peer-to-peer networks. For example, in traditional peer-to-peer networks, we use super-peer instead of miner. A miner tries to execute some management algorithms and follows its beneﬁts. As another example, we may use protocol instead of a smart contract. A smart contract is a protocol which is designated to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a contract in fully digitally manner. The smart contracts will play a key role in Distributed Autonomous Organizations  DAOs  in near future. In addition to distributed ledger technology, several technologies such as DAG  Directed Acyclic Graph , and Hash graph are presented to manage transactions in the literature.  3 Blockchain Application Development Processes  Recently, Blockchain applications have received much attention in many soft- ware projects. These projects are quickly built and developed around the various Blockchain applications. The application development process of these projects has usually messy and hurried characteristics. The matter is that a sort of competitive and informal processes for rapidly development of these projects do not assure nei- ther software quality, nor the basic concepts of software engineering. Therefore, the main phase to develop blockchain-based projects is to use sound software engi- neering methods. Considering this issue many documents are given in the web as technical reports and white papers but there are few academic works in the litera- ture. In the rest of this section, we focus on recent academic papers which focus on blockchain-based development process and then explain an informal process.  In [70], the authors mentioned that effective software testing, enhancing col- laboration in large teams, and facilitating the development of smart contracts are   Blockchain Architecture  169  key factors in the future of development process of blockchain-based projects. In [71], the following key issues are given for characterizing the data structure of the blockchain-based projects.  cid:129  Data redundancy  each node has a copy of the Blockchain   cid:129  Check of transaction requirements  cid:129  Recording of transactions in sequentially ordered blocks  cid:129  Whose creation is ruled by a consensus algorithm  cid:129  Transactions based on public-key cryptography  cid:129  Determining transaction scripting language  The author of [71], suggested a software development process based on agile methodology. An overview of this process is given in Fig. 4 and the detailed descriptions of its activities are given below.  1. Deﬁne goals: In this phase, the goal of the system is deﬁned. 2.  Identify actors: In this phase, interaction among human roles and external systems devices is analyzed to extract the actors of the system.  3. Requirements analyses: In terms of user stories or features, the system  requirements are extracted in this phase.  4. Dividing system: The system is divided two subsystems in this phase as given  below:  cid:129  The Blockchain system: This system is composed of the Smart Contracts  SCs .  cid:129  The non-blockchain system: The external system that interacts with the blockchain system.  5. Design of the smart contract subsystem. 6. Design of the external subsystem. 7. Code and test the systems. 8.  Integrate, test, and deploy the overall system.  The authors of [72] reported three complementary modeling process to smart contract design. Their process is based on software engineering models such as E-R diagrams, UML, and BPMN. They tried to suggest some improvements to the UML Class Diagram to better represent Smart Contract concepts. The authors of [73] utilized an action design research approach and situational method engineering to propose a method for the development of Blockchain use cases. They evaluated their method through application and testing in four distinct industries such as banking, insurance, construction, and automotive.  Researchers and practitioners still lack a systematic approach to understand the potential of blockchain and to design efﬁcient application development process. This problem becomes more challenging when many of the algorithms in this ﬁeld are published as white papers and technical reports. At the end of this part, we explain a development process which has been given in [74] recently. The steps suggested in [74] are given below.   170  Fig. 4 Blockchain oriented software  BOS  development process [71]  A. M.

Figure 5 shows the elements of a blockchain-based system and Fig. 6 shows the patterns which should be designated. In [75], these patterns are described in more detail.  5 Key Participants in the Blockchain Environments  In different types of blockchains, the key participants are different from each other [1]. Many participants such as programmers, founders, network managers, policy regulators, and miners can be considered as participants but note that those entities which conduct the consensus process belong to the main participants in a blockchain ecosystem. In the rest of this section, the key participants of the consensus process are studied considering the type of blockchains.  cid:129  Public Blockchains: In this type, anyone can join and participate in the network. The network typically has a mechanism to encourage more participants to join the network. Bitcoin is one of the well-known examples for public blockchain [68].  cid:129  Consortium Blockchains: In this type, a consortium blockchain is a distributed ledger where the consensus process is controlled by a preselected set of peers.   172  A. M. Saghiri  Fig. 6 The blockchain-based application pattern collection [75]   cid:129  Private Blockchains: In this type, the write permissions in the system are kept centralized to one organization but read permissions may be public or restricted. Hyperledger is an example of private blockchian [69]. In these systems, key par- ticipants are related to the organization which manages the blockchain.  It is obvious that a system may be created using a combination of the above blockchains. Therefore, the process of identifying the participants may be converted to a complex process.  6 Conclusions  In this chapter, we focused on several important issues in designing blockchain architecture. We introduced the required concepts from peer-to-peer networks. In addition, the modern applications of peer-to-peer networks which have the potential to be used in designing blockchain architecture were summarized. We emphasized on the development process and key participants of these systems. It should be noted that there are many issues which can be considered as future works such as ledger management, security mechanisms, and layered design of blockchain architecture.

This provides the emerging Internet of Things  IoT  more impact, potential, and wide acceptance. However, the privacy and security concerns hamper its further adoption and development; this is mainly due to its reliance on a centralized cloud, fog, intrusion detection systems, ﬁrewall, and antivirus software for data, identity processing, and secure communication. On the one hand, IoT devices’ have some authentication and authorization ﬂaws in the heterogeneous deployment and also relatively “vulnerable” facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. If the single IoT device is compromised, the whole net- work becomes faulty. The challenges of security issues are increasing by the central authorities or third parties like cloud, fog, ﬁrewall, etc. To provide a cryptographic technique for both authentication and communication problems, to avoid the use of central authority we need a platform which is decentralized and cryptographically strong with immutability. The emerging blockchain technology effectively resolves the issues and provides extra novel facilities like distributed, publically viewable to strengthen security.

Biswal et al.  1 Introduction and Architecture of IoT  In the present scenario, people are willing to enjoy the advantages of the Internet of things  IoT . The IoT includes almost everything from the body sensor to the current cloud system. It contains vital networks, such as grid, vehicular ubiquitous, and distributed networks. These networks have overcome the era of information technology over a decade. IoT refers to the big network formed by Internet comprising of physical objects or devices with unique identity  IP address  possessing sensing, computation, and or actuating capabilities individually or a combination of them. Here sensing refers to sensing the data from the surrounding physical environment, computing refers to aggregating the sensed data, performing analysis on it, and deriving certain results whereas actuating refers to performing the desired actions. These devices networked together in a physical environment are aimed at improving the existing scenario or making some changes to it to make our life smarter and better. The concepts of IoT used from vehicles parking to vehicles tracking, from smartcards technology to near-ﬁeld cards technology, these sensors are making their presence felt. In the IoT, system sensors play a very important role. The IoT system works over different networks and paradigm. Unusually, there is no network secure from security threats and vulnerabilities. There are each IoT layers unprotected to various kinds of attacks [1]. In this chapter, we focus on various kinds of possible attacks to be addressed and reduced to get secure communication over the IoT. The IoT is a vast network and thus a large volume and variety of data are generated by it every second. To deal with this big data, cloud computing comes out as the primary technology, that is, responsible for its storage, processing, and time-to-time analysis with the pool of shared resources it provides. The layering concept is described in Fig. 1.  The idea of the IoT was suggested in 1999 by the Auto-ID laboratory. The IoT can be described as “devices objects and information continually available across the internet”. Intercommunication of the objects that can be mentioned unambigu- ously and different networks represent the IoT system. In the IoT system, the main columnists are sensors, radio-frequency identiﬁcation  RFID , smart technologies, and nanotechnologies for different kinds of services. With the extreme reduction in the cost of the objects or things, sensors, actuators, bandwidth, processing, smart- phones, and the migration toward IPv6, 5G could make the IoT simple to gain than expected. Nowadays, each and every “thing” comes under one umbrella that com- prises all the things.  The IoT system also estimates everything as the same, not even differentiation between devices and humans. Objects or things comprise end users, data centers, smartphones, processing elements, Bluetooth, tablets, ZigBee, cellular networks, RFID and their tags, sensors, and actuators. Other ways, IoT incorporates “factual and virtual” anytime and anywhere, attracting the attention of both “creator and hacker” [2]. Naturally, discard the objects without any human involvement for a huge period could lead to thievery. IoT system incorporates many such objects or   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  179  .  .  f d p 9 7 8 1 0 7 0 7 1   f d p   g r o v i x r a . w w w  .      : s p t t h  e c r u o S  . s t p e c n o c  r e y a l -  m e t s y s T o I  1  .  g i F   180  A.

Security for the IoT would be unlikely intricate [3].  2 Stages of IoT System  The IoT system describes in ﬁve phases that is from data collection to data delivery to the end users on or off demand as shown in Fig. 2.  2.1 Stage I: Data Collection, Acquisition, Perception  In the vehicle tracking system or telemedicine application, the principle step is to gather or acquire data from the objects or devices. Based on the features of the objects or things, various types of data collectors are used. The object may be a static body or a dynamic vehicle.  2.2 Stage II: Storage  The collected data or information should be stored. If the thing has its own local memory, data or information can be stored. Mainly, IoT elements are installed with low memory and low processing ability. The cloud takes over the authority for storing the data or information in the case of stateless objects.  Fig. 2 Stages of IoT communication   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  181  2.3 Stage III: Intelligent Processing  The IoT system examines the data or information stored in the cloud and delivers smart services for work and life in hard real time. As well as the IoT system examines and replies to queries, IoT also controls objects or things. There is no inequity between a boot and a bot, the IoT system gives smart processing and control facility to all objects or things equally.  2.4 Stage IV: Data Transmission  Data transmission occurs in all phases: From sensors, RFID tags, or chips to DCs from DCs to processing units from processors to controllers, devices, or end users.  2.5 Stage V: Delivery  In this stage of the IoT, system delivers the processed data to objects on time without any mistake or modiﬁcation.  3 Threats on the Internet of Things  In the future, perhaps around the year 2020 with IPv6 and therefore the ﬁfth- generation communication network, different things are going to be a part of the IoT system. Security and privacy are going to be the key factors of concern at that point. The IoT will be viewed in numerous dimensions by the various parts of academe and corporates; regardless of the viewpoint, the IoT has not nevertheless reached maturity and is prone to all kinds of threats and attacks. The interference or recovery systems employed in the normal network and net can’t be employed in the IoT owing to its property. Since consumers need is not constant and every time they attempts to enhance technology to suit their wants. The growth of threats has affected a rise within the security measures that require to be taken into thought [4].  4 Stage Attacks  It determines the different attacks on the ﬁve stages of IoT system. Data leakage, Breach, Sovereignty and Authentication are the vital disturbances in the data per- ception stage as shown in Fig. 3.   182  Fig. 3 Possible attacks on IoT devices  A. K. Biswal et al.   cid:129  Data leakage or breach  cid:129  Data sovereignty  cid:129  Data loss  cid:129  Authentication on data  cid:129  Attacks on availability.  5 Attacks as Per Architecture  cid:129  External attack  cid:129  Wormhole attack  cid:129  Selective forwarding attack  cid:129  Sinkhole attack  cid:129  Sewage pool attack  cid:129  HELLO ﬂood attacks  cid:129  Addressing all things in IoT  cid:129  Distributed denial of service  DDoS   IoT faces many challenges but the issues present as a prime concern especially when we have entered into the phase of smart cities and smart devices. These challenges include the exponential growth in the amount of data generated; security and privacy issues are major concern for this. We require an authentic and secure communication channel between the devices. The development of cellular internet of things  C-IoT , M2M communication, and device-to-device  D2D  communication also leads to the generation of a huge amount of data each and every moment. To   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  183  handle this huge amount of data, the network and the core devices should have enough capacity and have to be more reliable.  6 Evaluation of Blockchain and Key Concepts  It started when bitcoin, cryptocurrency or electronic case broke into public awareness in 2009 but the excitement shifted to an aspect of bitcoin known as blockchain means the discovery of bitcoin helped people to work on the blockchain security concept [5]. The blockchain is essentially an append-only data structure that records all the activities in transactions and creates an immutable and distributed ledger of blocks when all participants in the peer-to-peer network agree without requiring trust on a central authority. In blockchain network, nodes do not trust each other because it has the ability to tolerate Byzantine failure. Each block in the blockchain is packed with many transactions and consists of a timestamp or nonce, senders and receivers keys, ids, communication message, device registration date, resources, and those required for authentication with a link to its predecessor via a cryptographic pointer, which forms a blockchain. The blockchain starts expanding from the genesis block, which is usually hardcoded and doesn’t have any references to the previous block. After this whenever the transactions start they are collected in blocks, which are found by the special nodes of the network called miners in a certain time period  ten minutes for bitcoin blockchain . To mine a valid block the miners have to follow different consensus techniques like Bitcoins Proof-of-Work  PoW , Proof-of-Stake  PoS , Proof-of-Authority  PoA , etc. After reaching a consensus, the block is broadcasted to other nodes in the network for validation. If all the nodes found that the block is a valid one then it is added to the blockchain. The working principle is as shown in Fig. 4.  Fig. 4 Blockchain working principle   184  A. K. Biswal et al.  7 Key Concepts of Blockchain  In order to understand blockchai,n one hasto go through its key concepts. Decentralization The main feature of blockchain is it provides a distributed ledger, which is available at all the members of the blockchain network by eliminating the third party. The changes will be reﬂected simultaneously at all members. Immutability Once data are appended in the blockchain it cannot be modiﬁed or its integrity cannot be hampered. If an intruder wants to change the content he has to mine the current block as well as the next blocks that follow the changed block, which requires a lot of processing capabilities. Miner These are the powerful members of the blockchain network. They take all the uncon- ﬁrmed transactions and mine to get a valid hash and it is forwarded to other nodes. If all agree then the block is appended to the blockchain and the miner is awarded some money for successful mining. Consensus Algorithm In order to create a valid block, the miners must come to an agreement after validating a node in the distributed blockchain system. Some popular consensus algorithms are proof-of-work, proof-of-authority, proof-of-byzantine failure, etc. Cryptographic Linking and Veriﬁcation Blockchain applies SHA-256 to ﬁnd the digest and any block in the blockchain is connected to its previous block via a cryptographic link.  8 Popular Blockchain Platforms  Ethereum When we try to integrate IoT with blockchain we require some platforms because we have to synchronize thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices with a backend server. After the innovation of bitcoin, its concept is extended to a platform where developers and entrepreneurs to build the distributed application for the Blockchain network. He referred to this concept of trust beyond just currency as “smart contracts” popularly known as Ethereum. The smart contracts are rules written by the developer to operate the IoT device. Ethereum is very much useful for securing IoT devices. By improving the limitations of Ethereum, many Ethereum-like blockchain platforms are developed such as IOTA, New, NEM, etc. The extension of Ethereum also includes multichain, HydraChain, and Openchain. Hyperledger Hyperledger provides a distributed transaction ledger to all its membership peers and   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  185  approves transaction using PBFT technique. Under Hyperledger there are so many projects like Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, and Hyperledger IROHA. It provides the private blockchain to its users.  Other platforms which provide blockchain are BigchainDB, Chain core,  Corda,etc.  8.1 Problems Related to IoT Data Authentication  and Communication  Authentication Authentication is the task involved in identifying if a person or an entity, who or what they proclaim themselves to be. Authentication process inculcates access for the systems through evaluation to see if a person’s credentials match the credentials in the repository of the legitimate users or in the data authentication server [6].  For example, logging on to any social network the user is required to provide his her credentials in the form of login id and password which is then checked and matched with the ones the server has. Importance of Authentication in IoT With the advent of smartphones, it has unfolded a tremendous potential for the business houses as well as the increasing number of consumers each second, on the other hand it has also unleashed a huge growth for the people with malicious intent to take hold of vital information and causing losses for both the business as well as the consumer [7].  In the greater of IoT, the inclusion of user or device authentication becomes ever more prevalent [8]. For example, when we go to open our associated vehicle with our cell phone, we need to be consoled that just we, the proprietors, are approved to do as such—gone before by effective “conﬁrmation”. A dimension of trust should be set up whereby general society must be sure that the correspondence has come straightforwardly from the named source and not somebody who represents a security danger to the system.  The utilization of biometrics and social biometrics  signals, swipe, and example forecasts  is making a remarkable dimension of client distinguishing proof—really ascribing the feeling of “individual” between the client and a gadget [9].  The period has gone long ago where information catches just incorporated a name and address. Progressively, information gathered and transmitted by these shrewd gadgets goes past speciﬁcally recognizing data and makes a point-by-point example of our regular daily existences continuously.  This is something that is being examined day by day as the business case for digital security has been increasingly pervasive [10]. Producers have an obligation to ﬁnd a way to guarantee individuals to feel safe with the systems and the gadgets that they are getting their hands into—and all more signiﬁcantly, enabling them to control who is approved or allowed to do as such.   186  A. K. Biswal et al.  8.1.1 Device Authentication  Taking into account to develop the IoT services accessible at low cost with quite a huge number of devices trying to associate with each other, there are some issues to overcome. These issues are divided into two categories:  Technological Challenges These issues are identiﬁed with underlined wireless technologies, vitality, versatility, circulated and dynamic nature of IoT and universal communications.  Security Challenges These difﬁculties are identiﬁed with security administrations like conﬁrmation, pro- tection, reliability, and secrecy. Security issues additionally incorporate heteroge- neous correspondence and end-to-end checkpoints.  An utmost vital effort of this research is to channelize the exercises of IoT assaults to comprehend the succession of moves taking place when the assaults are going on. The displaying of the security assaults comprehends a real perspective of the IoT channels and empower us to choose the alleviation designs [11].  Man-in-the-Middle Attack At the point when the gadgets are authorized into a system, important keys, security, and space parameters can be vulnerable to prying eyes. The vital keys can uncover the most secured key among gadgets and originality of the correspondence channel could be endangered. Man-in-the-middle attack is one sort of overhearing stealthily conceivable in the appointing period of gadgets to IoT. The key foundation convention is defenseless against man-in-the-middle attack and can trade off gadget conﬁrmation as gadgets as a rule don’t have earlier information about one another. As gadget validation includes the trade of gadget characters, an impersonation of the identity can become a reality because of man-in-the-middle attack.  Denial-of-Service Attack Adenial-of-service  DoS  attack is a kind of digital assault in which a malignant per- son means to render a system or other gadget inaccessible to its authorized clients by intruding on the gadget’s ordinary working. DoS attacks mostly work by overpower- ing or plaguing a machine with innumerable solicitations until the point when typical trafﬁc is not able to function properly, which brings in the denial of service to the legitimate clients. A DoS attack is described by utilizing a sole computer system to unleash the attack. The essential focal point of a DoS attack is to exhaust the limit of an intended machine, bringing about denial of service to extra demands. The various assault vectors of DoS attack can be gathered by their likenesses.  Replay Attack During the transfer of authentication data or different accreditations in IoT, this data can be modiﬁed, adjusted, or replayed to repulse the trafﬁc. This causes an intense replay attack. Replay attack is basically one type of dynamic man-in-the- middle attack. A replay attack happens when a cybercriminal pries in on a protected system correspondence, blocks it, and afterward deceitfully delays or resends it to   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  187  mislead the collector into doing what the programmer needs. The additional threat of replay attack is that a programmer doesn’t require high-level technical knowledge to unscramble a message subsequent to catching it from the system. The attack could bore the desired fruits just by resending the entire thing.  An example of it can be a person at an organization requests a monetary exchange by sending an encoded message to the organization’s account ofﬁcer. An imperson- ator pries in on this message, catches it, and is now in total control of a situation to resend it. Since it is a credible message that has been produced, the message is as of now effectively scrambled and looks genuine to the account ofﬁcer. Sybil Attack ASybil attack is a kind of security threat on an online system where one person tries to take over the network by creating multiple accounts, nodes, or computers. This can be as simple as one person creating multiple social media accounts. But in the world of cryptocurrencies, a more relevant example is where somebody runs multiple nodes on a blockchain network.  The word “Sybil” in the name comes from a case study about a woman named Sybil Dorsett, who was treated for Dissociative Identity Disorder—also called Multiple Personality Disorder  cid:129  Attackers may be able to outvote the honest nodes on the network if they create enough fake identities  or Sybil identities . They can then refuse to receive or transmit blocks, effectively blocking other users from a network.  cid:129  In really large-scale Sybil attacks, where the attackers manage to control the major- ity of the network computing power or hash rate, they can carry out a 51% attack. In such cases, they may change the ordering of transactions, and prevent transac- tions from being conﬁrmed. They may even reverse transactions that they made while in control, which can lead to double spending. Over the years, computer scientists have dedicated a lot of time and research to ﬁgure out how to detect and prevent Sybil attacks, with varying degrees of effective- ness. For now, there is no guaranteed defense.  8.1.2 Data Authentication  As humans we have been subjected to go through an array of scrutiny and stringent security measures to conﬁrm our identity, hence the question arises that the same amount of procedures should have been done to check the authenticity of the devices as well [12].  There is a wide variety of the IoT devices which may require different security procedures, in other words, the authentication requirements in one device may be different in another one. While a few adhere to propinquity-based norms like RFID, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, some like GPS, 4G do not require so [13]. Interfacing them is regularly as simple as ﬁltering for adjacent gadgets, by contributing a shortcode  that might be transformed from a default  or by utilizing a type of multifaceted veriﬁcation to check gadget and beneﬁciary consents [14].   188  A. K. Biswal et al.  IoT usage varies and the shifting from the traditional gear is inevitable, for this it must require a signiﬁcant stretch of time to channel through to all gadget producers means there is also a possible to design improved products. The majority of us know about e-commerce and its impact on our lives in the recent past. We might not purchase from a website that doesn’t use SSL or https is displayed at the address bar [13]. A comparative way to deal with IoT gadgets is likely and is known as PKI  Public-Key Infrastructure , where advanced authentications demonstrate the legitimacy of the site or for this situation, the IoT gadget.  Advanced declarations would guarantee a dimension of trust in an IoT gadget that may somehow be missing and, when joined with IoT applications to screen the foundation could recognize and anticipate access to uncertiﬁed gadgets with feeble security measures.  If health-related issues are concerned and other by, it is important that the pertinent clients be aware and in a position to make a decision for how their information is gathered, shared and examined [15]. An immensely strong technology to empower this kind of control is to necessitate that the client is effectively associated with the procedure, whereas the other important elements in the process can be issued security certiﬁcates for authentication in various stages whose validity would be limited to that particular session for ensuring proper coordination [16]. Without the client’s assent, no certiﬁcates would be issued and no conﬁrmed connections would happen. In this manner, no health-related information can be misused by any unauthorized party.  The complexity in issuing security tokens to the devices and the actors involved in the process is not the whole thing to be done [15]. There is a great scope in IoT for identifying various ways to authenticate the devices that are likely to be connected [17]. For example, the smartphones that one carries can be a device to be part of the authentication procedure. Similarly, the various wearable devices in the near future can follow the suit and authenticating the right users and keeping their data secure would be possible [18, 19].  8.1.3 Data Authorization  Some third-party applications mostly need limited access to a user’s account for some kind of activities [20]. It, therefore, becomes important to ensure that the data provided by the user is not compromised or manipulated, hence all requests for limited time period access should be authorized by the user himself. Access control deals in tow methods, one is authentication and the other is authorization.  Authentication facility allows the user to access the services using a simple login  id and password.  Authorization facility allows the user or the third-party application limited access  or creates a session after which the authorization may again be requested for.  The policies of one organization regarding authorization may not be applicable to another organization, with the changing times; the policies are needed to be changed from time to time [15]. The norms are needed to be scaled down according to the requirements of the consumer whereas on occasions it is to be dynamically enhanced   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  189  [14]. Since authorization plays a key role in deciding the access, a lot of hard labor goes into describing the stringent policies.  8.1.4 Secure Communication  With the advent of communication devices, securing the communication has always been a challenge. In this era of advanced technologies, even the eavesdroppers have become technically sound in their art of prying. These advancements in technologies have become a massive instrument in describing a nation’s prying capabilities along with securing its own interests.  Within a span of less than two decades, the number of cell phone users has risen exponentially. The users feel empowered, to have got hold of a device with which they can communicate while on the move. Even the organizations dealing with communication have deployed an army of workers round the clock to help the consumers.  Some customized form of communications has been possible from one device to another be it from a ship to a ship, or from an aircraft to another aircraft. Efforts are being made in this direction, so that one device to communicate with another, hassle free. It becomes tedious to ensure that the data sent from one device reaches to the other, without being leaked.  While in the past century, people had been empowered with the wireless devices, they were the one to decide whom to call and what to communicate. With the advancement in artiﬁcial intelligence, the devices would be aware of what to communicate and what information to be shared.  The Internet of Things  IoT  can possibly improve a large number of our day to day chores, schedules, and practices. The inevitable idea that the information relating to potentially every viewpoint of human movement, both open and private, will be cre- ated, processed, transmitted, and stored. Thus, respectability and classiﬁcation of the transmitted information and additionally the validation of the third-party applications offering that information is pivotal. Consequently, security is an indispensable part of the IoT [13]. Information systems, particularly the wireless devices, are inclined to an expansive number of assaults, for example, listening stealthily, copying, denial of service, etc., traditionally Internet frameworks relieve these assaults by depending on connection-layer, arrange-layer, transport-layer, or application-layer encryption and veriﬁcation of the fundamental information [21]. Despite the fact that a portion of these arrangements is relevant to the IoT area, the characteristically constrained han- dling and correspondence capacities of IoT gadgets keep the utilization comparably lesser than it is needed.  A good practice in dealing with IoT devices is to upgrade the policies along with the hardware. This would ensure that the data that is being transmitted, collected, and processed stays safe as it was with the user and as it ought to be with the intended client. It is additionally vital to deal with the characteristics of the IoT gadgets to guar- antee trust when gadgets endeavor to connect to a system or administration. Public- Key Infrastructure  PKI  [16] and advanced authentications provide a protected   190  A. K. Biswal et al.  supporting to device identiﬁcation and trust. Much of these seem easy but many of the organizations lack the resources to implement the stringent policies to protect the data of the users.  9 Solution Using Ethereum Smart Contracts  Ethereum The start of bitcoin revolutionized the use of blockchain and on a similar concept, Ethereum is developed as an open software platform for the developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. This runs exactly as programmed to lessen the time of consensus, appropriate proof-of-work for energy, and power constrained IoT devices.  Smart Contracts One of the most signiﬁcant aspects of Ethereum lies in the smart contract. Ethereum uses a smart contract on top of blockchain so that developers can write a program on the blockchain. Smart contracts is a self-operating programmed code that can be written for any instances such as contract tracking the value of meter, saving policy values which will run on top of blockchain to achieve decentralization [22].  9.1 Single- and Multilevel Authentication for IoT Devices  Single-level Authentication Single-level authentication is a procedure in which to get to approved administrations just a single or one of a kind accreditations should be given [23].  Step 1 IoT device puts forth its credentials for authentication. Step 2 The credentials are then forwarded to the browser, which is then redirected  to the authentication server.  Step 3 Upon receiving the credentials on the authentication server, the server pro- gram then authenticates the credentials with the already-existing database. Step 4 Once the received credentials and the already-existing credentials matches, the session would be granted until a speciﬁc time period, if the time periods exhaust, then the same procedure can be followed to gain access again.  Pros and Cons of Single-level Authentication The upsides of single dimension validation are Faster access to systems, Single-click approval for all application access for a user, better client encounter, however, the disservices incorporate single point of failure, different kinds of clients have diverse work processes. If that service provides any private or sensitive data that needs a more strong identity, veriﬁcation of the user for which single-level authentication can be   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  191  an obsolete one. Since the uses of IoT devices mostly include private and sensitive data such as transaction information, conﬁrmation, purchases, and administrative works, we need to conﬁrm the identities by asking more and strong credentials in a repetitive manner which can be done by multilevel authentication [24].  9.1.1 Multilevel Authentication  The multilevel authentication system takes into account the importance of the IoT devices, which would be allowed to send and receive information subject to satisfying the conditions [25]. Step 1 IoT Device puts forth its credentials for authentication. Step 2 The credentials are then forwarded to the browser when it checks the priority  of the particular device.  Step 3 According to the priority, the level of the security is assigned. Step 4 Upon being issued a level the IoT device proceeds further, if the security level is low, an id and password would sufﬁce to access the system, whereas the security level is high, along with the password a secure key would be required. This secure key would be generated and would be valid for a limited time period.  Step 5 Once the password and the valid security key matches, the session would be granted till a speciﬁc time period, if the time periods exhaust, then the same procedure can be followed to gain access again.  The generally utilized veriﬁcation conventions for IoT gadgets are Role-Based Access Management  RBAC , OAuth 2.0, Open ID, OMA DM, and LWM2 M. Since the logic rules of smart contracts, setup is done by the programmer and have the ability to provide decentralization it can give progressively effective access rules to associated IoT gadgets with way less intricacy when contrasted with the above protocols [26].  9.1.2 Architecture Description  We have considered a three-tier architecture to easy our authentication process. In the base layer, we deployed IoT devices, which operates under an IoT gateway device. The gateway device is responsible for internal and external communication and the Ethereum network is linked to the gateway device which means the gateway devices is the interface between IoT devices and Ethereum blockchain network as shown in Fig. 5.  Ethereum provides a unique key address to each device and provides decentral- ization by having a limited capability authentication server in it whereas cloud at the upper level helps when more storage, processing capability is required [27]. Address Mapping The objective of the framework is to make it serviceable for any outsider to empower   192  A. K. Biswal et al.  Fig. 5 Architecture for registration  clients to sign into their website utilizing an Ethereum address as an identiﬁer. No username or password is required. We acknowledge a customer attempting to sign in with an Ethereum address is a customer who owns an Ethereum address with some Ether, which is given when one installs ethereum wallet like in bitcoin wallet as some bitcoin is offered in order to participant in the process of validating the transaction. The key issue with this methodology is a little chance of compromising or losing Ethereum address mainly Ethereum private key and the requirement of some amount of ether. So some way of using an Ethereum address to login without requiring the private key for that address must be implemented for our new system. The following steps are used to get a secondary login-only address from the Ethereum address.  1.  2. 3. 4.  It establishes a mapping between two Ethereum addresses: one high-value address  the primary address  and a low value, login-only, secondary address. It certiﬁes only the owner of the primary address can establish this mapping. It records this information publicly in the blockchain. It emits events to monitor and react to changes in the data stored in it.  Let’s go over the full registration and authentication ﬂow to see how it all works together. We assume the user is the rightful owner of an Ethereum account with a certain amount of Ether.  Registration Process This is a onetime step to be played out in the ﬁrst run through the client wants to utilize the framework. When enrolled, the client can utilize his or her Ethereum address with any outsider site. The registration of the IoT device can be done at   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  193  the deployment time by connecting it to a mobile application for easy registration purpose. The steps are  1. The IoT device is connected to a mobile phone. 2. The mobile application enters its email address and unlock pattern. 3.  In the backend, the mobile application creates a Ethereum address which is used for login purpose only we can also say secondary Ethereum address which is sent to device email address.  4. By installing metamask extension in mobile’s Google Chrome app Ethereum wallet with Ethereum address is generated. We prefer test network of metamask to get some ether by synchronizing it with GitHub gist which is of free cost.  5. The device now maps both the address to perform this task requires the user to  spend a minimum amount of gas from his primary account.  6. The mapping address is forwarded to Ethereum network through metamask which ensures that the Ethereum account used by the user is not a spam account. 7. Once the link between addresses is established, the mobile application will show a conﬁrmation dialog. If the user conﬁrms, the mapping is established and the process is complete.  Now any device in the network has two address one is Ethereum address, which is kept securely by the IoT device, and one is secondary Ethereum-like login address, which is used by the IoT device for authentication purpose.  9.1.3 Single-level Authentication Process and Steps Using Ehtereum  After the deployment of IoT device in a homogeneous or heterogeneous network authentication is required among the IoT device to proof uniqueness and identity.  The beneﬁt of authentication using the blockchain network is complete decen- tralization. In order to achieve authentication in a decentralized Ethereum network is linked to IoT gateway devices, which are connected to two similar or dissimilar network and under blockchain peer-to-peer network [28].  1. The IoT device, which wants to communicate with other devices, has to authen-  2.  ticate itself. It has to provide secondary Ethereum address as well as some credentials of the device it wants to communicate.  3. The secondary address is matched in the authentication server, which is at the IoT gateway device. After the gateway device validates, it is further given to blockchain Ethereum network through which we will achieve decentralization.  4. After the validation, the device is authenticated for communication.   194  A. K. Biswal et al.  9.1.4 Multilevel Authentication Process and Steps Using Ehtereum  1. First, the gateway node will check the level of the IoT device when it initiates a  2.  communication. If it is a highly sensitive device its priority is high, which require a multilevel authentication whereas less priority device can be authenticated using single- level authentication.  3. For multi-level authentication, the device has to provide its secondary Ethereum address, which will be matched at the IoT gateway device and forwarded to the authentication server  same as single-level authentication .  4. For the second-level authentication, the authentication server will ask a higher  5.  credential like primary Ethereum address to validate itself. If the primary Ethereum address is matched the server will give a conﬁrmation message and the communication will start.  9.1.5 Continuous Authentication  IoT is bringing computing both onto our bodies and into our daily surroundings. Devices that maintain permanent physical contact with the user during usage, human activity trackers, smartwatches, and semi-permanent insulin pumps [29]. Examples of in-environment computing devices include intelligent thermostats, smart appli- ances, remotely controllable household equipment, and weather-based automated lawn irrigation system. Because of the diversity of devices and applications, a uni- versal solution to the problem of continuous authentication of users on devices with- out conventional interfaces might not exist. For the contact-based device, a mixed approach of biometric and machine learning is proposed and for noncontact devices, radio-frequency  RF  signals, ambient light, and sound surrounding to the device is considered [30]. Continuous Authentication Using Ethereum 1. The device, which requires continuous authentication, will give its secondary  Ethereum address when a session starts [31].  2. Using smart contract logic ﬁx the session duration for a ﬁxed or random time. 3. Before the session expires the device will get a dialog notiﬁcation which the device needs to answer, which includes its previously stored data in the Ethereum network to avoid trafﬁc problem which is completely implementation depen- dent .  9.1.6 Authorization  Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has authority to access the requested content or issue certain commands. It is tightly coupled with the authen- tication as the user must be authenticated in order to get authorized. Authorization   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  195  is required because, in any environment, different users who have different access control right might consume the same physical resource [32].  Beneﬁt Using Blockchain Since blockchain is a decentralized database that is consistently held up to date presents many advantages to the users. These advantages become especially inter- esting, when many different parties need access to the same information [33].  Authorization Using Ethereum Smart Contracts Using smart contract we can set up different blockchain concepts, which will be helpful for particular IoT devices based on the blockchain principles which are listed below [34]:  Context Blockchain The Context Blockchain stores contextual information obtained from sensors, pro- cessed data, and manual inputs.  Relationships Blockchain Responsible for the storage of the public credentials and relationships of all entities.  Rules Blockchain The Rules Blockchain keeps the authorization rules deﬁned by owners to their objects or by objects to themselves.  Accountability Blockchain The Accountability Blockchain registers information about permissions or denies of access to the object. The information required to registered is described in the Rules Blockchain.  To authorize a particular device we have to check the credentials of the device  and will ﬁnd to which blockchain it can access.  9.2 Securing Data Communication Using Blockchain  Hyperledger Composer  Data Communication in IoT Internet of Things  IoT  is fast growing at an unprecedented rate: the number of connected IoT sensing devices is expected to reach 8 billion by 2018, as predicted by Cisco [31]. IoT devices generate a large amount of sensing data to reﬂect physical environments or conditions of objects and human beings. As most IoT devices carry constrained resource and limited storage capacity, sensed data need to be transmitted and stored at resource-rich platforms, such as a cloud.  Problem with Current Scenario  1. Since the detecting information is put away in an outsider cloud, they could be deﬁled by outside assailants, malevolent cloud representatives [35], transmission disappointments, stockpiling misfortune, and so forth.   196  A. K. Biswal et al.  2. Problem with managing event-based data such as temperature change and time series based data which is generated by each device for every ﬁxed time period. 3. Due to a diverse integration of services, devices, and network, the data stored on a device is vulnerable to privacy violation by compromised nodes existing in an IoT network.  4. Various vulnerabilities in IoT incorporate those caused by uncertain program- ming ﬁrmware [23]. The code with dialects, for example, JSON, XML, SQLi, and XSS should be tried cautiously. Additionally, the product ﬁrmware refreshes should be completed in a safe way.  9.2.1 Overview of Hyperledger  The tech giants like IBM, Linux Foundation, SAP, Intel on December 2015 decided to pool their resources and create open-source immutable, distributed ledger tech- nology with a consensus that anyone could use to advance blockchain development technologies [36].  Hyperledger Goals  1. Create enterprise-grade, open-source, distributed ledger frameworks, and code  bases to support business transactions.  2. Provide neutral, open, and community-driven infrastructure supported by tech-  3. Build technical communities to develop blockchain and shared ledger POCs, use  nical and business governance.  cases, ﬁeld trails, and deployments.  4. Educate the public about the market opportunity for blockchain technology. 5. Promote our community of communities taking a toolkit approach with many  platforms and frameworks [37].  Hyperledger Working Principle  Hyperledger Validating Peers  VPs  do not mine blocks and do not share the blocks between them. Here is how it works:  1. When we submit a transaction that is sent to one trusted VP. 2. The trusted VP sends the transaction to all other VPs. 3. The VPs in hyperledger uses the proof-of-byzantine––failure consensus algo-  rithm to validate the transaction.  4. All VPs execute the same transactions following the total order and build a valid block after calculating hashes as per difﬁculty level with the executed transactions.  Since the transaction execution is deterministic  should be  and the number of transactions in a block is ﬁxed the order of block will be the same after validation [38].   Authenticating IoT Devices with Blockchain  197  Securing Data in Hyperledger Putting private information on the record accompanies an inalienable problem: If everybody sees a similar record, how might we have private information that some can see yet others can’t? A typical arrangement in numerous frameworks is to put on the record just encryption  or a hash  of the private information, while holding the information itself under the control of the gathering that claims it.  Hyperledger Fabric executes channels, which are basically discrete records. The information on a channel is just obvious to the individuals from that channel, how- ever, not to different companions in the framework. This arrangement gives some proportion of protection  from non-part peers , however, despite everything it neces- sitates that all individuals from a channel trust each other with every one of the information on this channel.  Solution The parties store their private data on the ledger, encrypt with their own secret key. When private data is needed in a smart contract, the party who has the key decrypts it and uses the decrypted data.  Protection of Data Using this decentralized and scrambled system known as hyperledger, we could be well on our approach to ensuring our information and our messages because it provides immutability to all the transaction messages  it transmits or communicate. Numerous worries have been hailed up by clients that the web-based life destina- tions that we use can follow our messages and information, even down to the contacts we store on our phones. Through the utilization of blockchain innovation is inside informing, which mean the blockchain users or clients could have signiﬁcant relax- ation realizing that their information was encoded and can be decoded by those with an explicit private key or access authorization.  Speed of Processing While instant messaging is already “instant”, the speed at which other forms of communication can be sent online could be massively improved by blockchain tech- nology. Emails, document transfers, cloud storage, and more could be passed over the blockchain and due to the fact that all transactions are validated by a member of the network, this could make the entire process much more streamlined.  Communication between two nodes in a hyperledger network. Mainly, there are three types of nodes:  Client or submitting-client: a client that submits an actual transaction-invocation  to the endorsers, and broadcasts transaction-proposals to the ordering service.  Peer: a node that commits transactions and maintains the state and a copy of the  ledger. Besides, peers can have a special endorser role.  Ordering-service-node or ordered: a node running the communication service that  implements a delivery guarantee, such as atomic or total order broadcast.  gRPC protocol is for communication between various entities of hyperledger  fabric [39].   198  A. K. Biswal et al.  9.3 Implementation of a Simple IoT-Blockchain Paradigm  Using Hyperledger  Asset Tracking Using IoT Sensors in Blockchain Hyperledger Composer In any blockchain network, there must be a group of entities which we will term as leader or miner of the network but when it comes to hyperledger composer all the required works are done at the backend of the network. In Hyperledger composer, the vp nodes are doing the mining process to come to a consensus and follows PBFT for its proof-of-work [36].  End Users So to achieve our goal we must have participants  sender, Importer, receiver, IoT devices for intermediate information collection, IoT Gps tracker for location tracking  there must be agreement among them.  Asset The assets can be anything which is transported in a container in which a temperature sensor IoT device is installed for constant monitoring of temperature.  Transaction The things that need to be tracked are the transactions which include:  1. An IoT device deployed inside the container for constant monitoring of tempera- ture in the container to measure weather. It is either above maximum temperature or below the minimum temperature.  2. Another GpsIoT device is installed in the container to track the location of weather  departed from the sender or delivered to the receiver.  Events The blockchain network which notiﬁes to the end users is all about the events.  1. A temperature reading has exceeded an upper or lower boundary X number of times  this might indicate a problem with the shipping container itself, for example .  2. A shipment has been received. 3. A shipment has been arrived at the port  an IoT GPS sensor could report this  event, for example .

All the transactions of cryptocurrencies are stored in chronolog- ical order to help users in tracking the transactions without maintaining any central record of the transactions. Application prospects of blockchain are promising and have been delivering the result since its inception. Blockchain technology has evolved from initial cryptocurrency to new-age smart contracts and has been implemented and applied in many ﬁelds. Although a lot of studies have been carried out on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, but a systematic examination on the secu- rity of blockchain systems is still missing. In this chapter, we will try to demonstrate a systematic illustration on the security threats to blockchain and survey the cor- responding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We will discuss the security and the privacy of blockchain along with their impact with regards to different trends and applications in this chapter. The chapter is intended to discuss key security attacks and the enhancements that will help develop better blockchain systems.

Blockchain can be deﬁned as an integrated infrastructure of multiﬁeld applications like ﬁnancial market, IOT, medical N.

Gupta  ﬁeld, etc. Bitcoin is one example of blockchain technology that is gaining popularity these days. Other application areas of blockchain are the protection of Intellectual property, International payments, Prediction market, Hyper ledger, Ethereum, etc.  Financial industry  FinTech  is using blockchain as the core technology for its operation, but the security of blockchain has always remained an area of concern for users. Security is often measured in terms of integrity, conﬁdentiality, and avail- ability. Most of the public blockchain system are working on distributed systems and are low on conﬁdentiality, although these systems promise integrity and avail- ability. Availability of data is always on a higher end in these blockchain systems. Availability of readable data is higher as data is replicated on distributed systems but is low for write availability. Although the core architecture of any blockchain system is very secure, the implementations of innovative technologies have exploited the security aspects of blockchain. Blockchain system is also vulnerable to leakage of transactional privacy because of the visibility of all public keys of the network to everyone. In the recent past, various security vulnerabilities have been reported related to Ethereum and smart contracts. For example, in June 2016, the criminals have used recursive calling vulnerability to attack smart contracts and have stolen approximately 60 million dollars.  Various studies have been conducted on security and privacy issues of blockchain but none of them have given the solutions related to security enhancements. In this chapter, we will try to elaborate more comprehensive perspective of blockchain technologies and their related security issues. In this chapter, we will also discuss various security risks related to popular blockchain systems, giving an example of real attacks and will analyze the vulnerabilities exploited. In this chapter, we will also discuss various encryption techniques used by blockchain systems to provide data safety and protect vulnerability.  2 Blockchain Aspects for Consideration  The key aspects to be considered for a blockchain system are security issues and countermeasures of a blockchain system and the various privacy issued involved  Fig. 1 .  Fig. 1 Aspects of blockchain [1]   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  209  2.1 Security of Blockchain  Security of blockchain is a key concept as it involves the protection of information and data that is used in cryptocurrency transactions and in blocks against various malicious and non-malicious attacks. Protection involves implementation of various security policies, tools, and IT services to detect and protect the threats.   a  Defense in penetration. In this strategy, various corrective measures are enforced to protect the data. It works on the principle of protecting data in multiple layers instead of implementing a single layer of security.   b  Minimum privilege. This method reduces the accessibility of data to the lowest  possible level to strengthen and enhance the security level.   c  Manage vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are checked and managed by modify-  ing, identifying, authenticating the user, and patching the gap.   d  Manage risks. Risks of an environment are processed by identifying the risk,  assessing the level of risk, and by controlling the possibility of risks.   e  Manage patches. In this strategy, we patch the administered part like code,  application, operating system by acquiring, testing, and installing patches.  Blockchain technology uses several techniques to ensure the security required in transaction data or block data, irrespective of the usage or data in the block. Several applications like Bitcoin use cryptographic techniques for data safety.  The other most secure idea of blockchain is that the longest chain is the legitimate one. This dispenses with the security chances because of 51% dominant attack and fork issues. As the longest chain is the most genuine, alternate assaults end up invalid and void as they end up being stranded forks.  2.2 Privacy of Blockchains  Privacy is the capacity of a solitary individual or a gathering to disconnect themselves or information along these lines conveying everything that needs to be conveyed dis- cerningly. Security in blockchain implies having the capacity to perform exchanges without spilling recognizable proof data. In the meantime, privacy enables a client to stay agreeable by discerningly unveiling themselves without exhibiting their action to the whole system.  The objective of enhancing privacy in blockchain is to make it incredibly difﬁcult for different clients to duplicate or utilize other clients’ crypto proﬁle. An immeasur- able volume of variations can be perceived when applying blockchain technology [8].   a  Stored data sorting. Blockchain gives the edibility to store all types of data. The privacy viewpoint in blockchain changes for individual and organizational data. Despite the fact that privacy rules are applicable on individual data, increasingly stringent privacy rules apply to sensitive and organizational data.   210  N. Gupta   b  Storage distribution. Full nodes in the network are the nodes that store the entire copy of the blockchain. Full nodes when combined with the append- only characteristics of blockchain system often lead to redundancy in data. This redundancy in data in blockchain system adds two new features: transparency and variability. Transparency and variability levels in the network are decided by the compatibility level of application with its data minimization.   c  Append-only. It is not possible to change the information of previous blocks within the blockchain undiscovered. The append-only feature of blockchain in some cases doesn’t curtail to the correction of users, particularly if the infor- mation is recorded incorrectly. Special attention has to be provided while dis- tributing rights to data subjects in blockchain technology.   d  Private versus public blockchain. Blockchain accessibility is remarkable from a privacy point of view. At an advanced level, the restricted data on a block can be encrypted by authorized users for conditional access, as each node in the blockchain holds a copy of the entire blockchain.   e  Non-permissioned versus permissioned types of blockchain. With public or unauthorized blockchain applications, all users are allowed to add data in principle. Distribution of network control can be restored by allowing trusted mediators.  3 Security Issues of Blockchain Technology  Blockchain has captured a lot of attention in recent times. Although various features of blockchain technologies have given us convenient and reliable services but security and privacy issues are still an area of concern that needs attention. Various authors have conducted studies on security issues and privacy issues of blockchain technology but a detailed and systematic study is needed that will try to cover all the important aspects. Various security issues are:   a  51% vulnerability  b  Double spending  c  Mining pool attacks  d  Client-side security threats  e  Forking  f  Criminal activity  g  Private key security  h  Transaction privacy leakage.   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  211  3.1 51% Vulnerability  To develop mutual trust, blockchain works by integrating distributed consensus mechanism. In this mechanism, the computing power is distributed among all the available data miners. Work of these data miners is to check the hashes generated by CPU cycles. If these miners join together, they can become a big mining pool having maximum computing power. If the mining pool has 51% or more computing power, they can take control of the blockchain and can cause serious security risks. For example, in POW-based blockchains, if the hashing power of a single miner is 50% more than the total hashing power of a complete blockchain system, then the miner can easily launch 51% attack and can cause vulnerabilities like:  cid:129  Reverse transaction attacks  cid:129  Double spending  cid:129  Exclude transactions  cid:129  Modify transactions  cid:129  Disturbing operations of other miners  cid:129  Termination of veriﬁcation process.  In other examples, a single miner working on a POS-based blockchain can have 50% of the total coins can launch a 51% attack and can modify and exploit the information of blockchain system.  3.2 Double Spending  If a consumer is using the same cryptocurrency for multiple transactions, then it is double spending. An attacker can execute race attacks to initiate double spending. In POW-based blockchain, these types of attacks are comparatively easy to implement because the attacker can easily exploit the time between initiation of two transactions, as well as, conﬁrmation of two transactions. Before the attacker’s second transaction got invalid, he got the output of the ﬁrst transaction which may lead to double spending.  The models to depict double spending behavior of an attacker are as follows:  Assumption  cid:129  Vendor address is known to the attackers before initiation of the attack.  cid:129  Let have two transactions T1 and T2.  cid:129  Same Bitcoin address as input for both the transactions. Working  cid:129  Set T1 recipient address as targeted vendor address.  cid:129  Set T2 recipient address as colluding address that is controlled by the attacker.  cid:129  Initiate T1 so that it will be added to the wallet of the vendor.   212  N. Gupta   cid:129  Before conﬁrmation of T1, initiate T2 as well.  cid:129  While T2 is in process, the attacker will get the conﬁrmation of T1 and has suc- cessfully completed the transaction.  cid:129  When T2 completes, T1 will be mined as invalid while the attacker has already used the same cryptocurrency twice.  cid:129  Because of the colluding address of T2 which is owned by the attacker, he still owns the BTC and is enjoying the service without spending BTC.  3.3 Mining Pool Attacks  To increase the computing power or the hash power of a block, mining pools are created. These pools directly affect the time required to verify a block. These mining pools also increase the chances of winning the mining reward.  Mining pools are evolving and the vulnerability to exploit these pools are also  increasing. Mining pool attacks are of two types:   a  Internal attacks  b  External attacks.  Internal attacks are the attacks in which the miner maliciously collect more than the required rewards and disrupt the normal functionality causing the pool to disregard successful mining attempts.  External attacks are caused when the miner uses higher hash power to attack the pool causing double spending. Mining pool attacks include selﬁsh mining, hopping attacks, block withholding, bribery attack, etc.  3.4 Client Side Security Threats  The popularity of various cryptocurrencies increased the number of users to join blockchain networks. Every user on the blockchain network has a set of private–pub- lic keys to access its cryptocurrency wallets. Therefore, it is necessary to manage these keys securely. An important aspect of client-side security is, if the client lose or compromise the keys, then he she will not be able to access its wallet and will lead to irrevocable monetary loss. The client security is compromised using various mechanisms like hacking, using buggy software, or by incorrect usage of the wallet.  3.5 Forking  Forking refers to the agreement that takes place between decentralized nodes when the software upgrades. It is an important issue as it involves many blockchains at once.   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  213  In forking, whenever a new version of the software related to blockchain is published, a new agreement in consensus rule also changed between all the decentralized nodes. Because of the above process, the nodes in the blockchain are divided into two types, i.e., old nodes and new nodes. The new nodes thus formed may or may not agree with the transactions blocks sent by the old nodes. Similarly, old nodes may or may not agree with the transaction blocks sent by the new nodes. Because of this fork problem arises. Fork problem is divided into two types:   a  Soft fork  b  Hard fork.  Hard fork happens when the system upgrades to a new version and is not com- patible with the old version. New version nodes did not agree with the mining of old version nodes and hence, both form their own blockchain. When hard fork occurs, all the old nodes in the network are requested to upgrade to a new agreement. If the old nodes don’t upgrade themselves, then they can continue to work as a different chain and hence, the ordinary chain of nodes will fork into two chains: old and new. When the new version or the agreement is not compatible with the old version and the new nodes don’t agree with the transaction mining of old nodes, and then soft fork happens. In soft fork, nodes in the network don’t have to upgrade themselves to the new agreement immediately, instead this process happens gradually and will not affect the stability and effectiveness of the system. Also, soft fork has only one chain. A soft fork can also be the result of a temporary divergence. When a particular miner is using non-upgraded software, clients on their nodes violate a new consensus rule that their nodes don’t understand.  3.6 Criminal Activity  Bitcoin users can have multiple Bitcoin addresses and the address is not related to their true identity in life. Bitcoin was therefore used in illegal activities. Users can buy or sell any product through some third-party trading platforms that support Bitcoin. Since this process is anonymous, it is difﬁcult to track user behaviurs, let alone legally binding. Some of the frequent criminal activities with Bitcoin include:   a  Ransomware: The criminals frequently use ransomware to extort money and use Bitcoin as a trade currency. In July 2014, a ransomware called CTB-Locker spread throughout the world as a mail attachment. If the user clicks the attach- ment, the ransomware runs in the system background and encrypts approxi- mately 114 types of each. The victim must pay a certain amount of Bitcoin Wi to the attacker within 96 h. Otherwise, the encrypted_les will not be restored.  b  Underground market: Bitcoin is often used in the underground market as a currency. Silk Road, for example, is an anonymous, international online mar- ketplace which operates as a hidden Tor service and uses Bitcoin as its currency. The top ten item categories on the Silk Road are listed in Table 1. Most of the   214  Table 1 Top ten categories of items available in Silk Road  N. Gupta  Number  Category  Items  Percentage  %   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Weed Drugs Prescription Benzos Books Cannabis Hash Cocaine Pills Blotter  LSD   3338 2194 1784 1193 955 877 820 630 473 440  13.7 9.0 7.3 4.9 3.9 3.6 3.4 2.6 1.9 1.8  products sold on the Silk Road are drugs or some other controlled products in the real world. Since international transactions account for a large proportion on the Silk Road, Bitcoin makes the transaction more convenient on the underground market, which is harmful to social security.   c  Money laundering: Because Bitcoin has features such as anonymity and virtual network payment and has been adopted by many countries, Bitcoin carries the lowest risk of money laundering compared to other currencies. Oh, Cody et coll. propose Dark Wallet, a Bitcoin application that can completely stealthy and private the Bitcoin transaction. Dark Wallet can encrypt and mix the user’s transaction information with valid coins making money laundering much easier.  3.7 Private Key Security  In blockchain systems, the user’s private key is recognized as a security and authen- tication credential created by the user and no third party is involved in this process. Whenever a user creates a wallet for a cryptocurrency, he she must import the private key into the wallet as well. This private key is imported into the wallet to guarantee the security and authentication of the cryptocurrencies. If the private key is lost or stolen, it cannot be recovered, which means that the user can not access the wallet with any other alternative means and that all his cryptocurrencies in the wallet are unavailable.  Blockchain systems are not controlled by third-party institutions, so lost or stolen private key scenarios lead to the risk of data being altered by untraceable attackers.   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  215  Table 2 Linkability analysis of Monera transaction inputs with mixins  Not deducible  %   Deducible  %   In total  %   Using newest TXO 15.07 Not using newest TXO 22.61 37.68 In total  4.60 57.72 62.32  19.67 80.33 100  3.8 Transaction Privacy Leakage  Since the behaviors of users in the blockchain are traceable, the blockchain sys- tems take measures to protect the privacy of users’ transactions. They use one-time accounts in Bitcoin and Zcash to store the received cryptocurrency. In addition, the user must assign a private key for each transaction. In this way, the attacker cannot determine if the cryptocurrency is recovered in different transactions received by the same user. In Monero, users can include certain chaff coins  called “mixins”  when initiating a transaction so that the attacker cannot determine the linkage between the actual coins spent by the transaction.  The data protection measures in the blockchain are unfortunately not very robust. Andrews et al. [13] empirically assess two weaknesses in the Mixin sampling strategy of Monero and ﬁnd that 66.09% of all transactions do not contain mixins. The 0-mixin transaction will lead to the sender’s privacy leakage. Since users can use 0-mixin transaction outputs as mixins, these mixtures can be deducted. In addition, they study the mixin sampling method and ﬁnd that the mixin selection is not really random. More frequently, new TXO  transaction outputs  are used. They also ﬁnd that 62.32 % of mixin transaction inputs are deductible, as shown in Table 2 [13]. By taking advantage of these weaknesses in Monero, the actual transaction inputs can be determined with 80% accuracy.  4 Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  Discussions about blockchain technology nowadays seem to be everywhere, with potential applications covering industries as diverse as banking, healthcare, prop- erty, law enforcement, entertainment, and even wine and jewelry sales. Different blockchain applications present different and unique data security and privacy challenges and opportunities, but three general categories currently concern legal privacy experts. The ﬁrst involves the necessary bridge between the physical and cyberspace limits; the second involves sensitive information that is actually stored on the blockchain; and the third involves the very existence of blockchains. Each of these options offers trade-offs between security, privacy, speed, and functionality, and different applications require different blockchain networks to work according to each application’s speciﬁc requirements.   216  N. Gupta  4.1 Physical-Cyberspace Boundary  The “physical-cyberspace boundary” refers to the concept that when a ﬂesh-and- blood person interacts in cyberspace, they do so through an “online identiﬁer.” For example, if you want to interact with users on Facebook, you need to create a user- name and log on to Facebook’s network knows who you are. The same applies to any online interaction, whether it is banking, purchasing concert tickets, or downloading music—a connection between you and your online identiﬁer needs to be established in order to participate in a transaction. The ID is pseudo-anonymous e.g., a bank account or e-mail address that has no real name attached to it, but at some point the physical-cyberspace boundary has to be a bridge of the physical-cyberspace bound- ary. At present, this scaffold is cultivated fundamentally through username and secret key blends, sometimes with the expansion of multifaceted veriﬁcation techniques. In the near future, biometric identiﬁers will supplant usernames and passwords as the methods for intersecting the physical-cyberspace boundary. One problem with this system is that in order for a physical person to log into a network, the network must have a copy of the login credentials of that person coupled with the online identiﬁer of that person. These credentials must only be stored in one place in a centralized system  e.g., on Facebook or your bank’s central servers . These credentials would be stored in a blockchain network on all the nodes containing the blockchains with which you want to interact, some of which can be more easily compromised than a secure central server.  This is particularly important when it comes to biometric identiﬁers, which are not easily changed once they are compromised by identity thieves. Compounding this issue is the fact that as will be mentioned underneath, the character of a blockchain approach that all facts stored on a blockchain remain stored as additional blocks are added to the chain, which means sensitive private data can be saved in cyberspace for all time.  Some other issues with blockchain are absence of a strong central authority, it may be difﬁcult to save you from hackers having access to sensitive statistics once a person’s login credentials are compromised.  For example, if someone hacks your bank account or steals your credit card information, you can call your bank and update your login information or cancel your old credit card. In a blockchain network with no strong central authority, it can be difﬁcult to update your login credentials, and even possible for a hacker to lock you out by updating the credential once they have access.  Not only is the potential for hacking of this sensitive information problematic from a security standpoint, but it also creates uncertainty concerning who, if anyone, is responsible for notifying individuals if their login credentials are compromised. Most states have passed data breach notiﬁcation laws requiring personal information custodians  “PII”  to notify PII owners if their PII is compromised. At this stage, it is unclear how these laws are applied to a distributed network such as blockchain or whether they are even written applicable.   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  217  4.2 Information Storage and Inference  Some of the data which will be stored on blockchains will be particularly sensitive—blockchain networks are currently being explored as means of record- ing and updating health care records, genomic sequences, and biometric credentials  as discussed above . While any sensitive information stored on the blockchain will  as a best practice  be encrypted, because of the distributed nature of the blockchain, hackers may target those speciﬁc nodes that, for one technical reason or another, can be more easily compromised to access the encrypted information, or where the laws are inadequate to prevent such hacking. This concern is compounded when it comes to government-employed hackers who can beneﬁt from the physical location of nodes in countries where information is more easily hacked or where the laws are insufﬁcient to prevent such hacking. While privacy risks can be mitigated by operating in closed networks, there are beneﬁts to open networks that require at least some blockchains containing sensitive information to operate in networks that are less than completely closed. Another concern about open networks is that although the information itself is encrypted, sensitive information can be gathered from the fact that transactions take place. For example, if two large banks engage in a high volume of transactions within a short period of time, information can be extrapo- lated from this information by other banks or private individuals who can see the transactions happening, even if they cannot see the transaction details themselves. On a more personal level, if a doctor accesses the patient’s health records to make changes, a hacker can see the transaction if he knows the doctor’s and the patient’s online identiﬁers. Although the hacker cannot see the health records or what has changed without accessing and decrypting the records, he or she can at least con- clude that the patient has seen a particular doctor on a speciﬁc date, information that a patient might want to keep privately.  Equally problematic is the fact that at this point, it is unclear who, if anyone might be legally liable in the event this information is accessed and harm results to the owner of the information, or to a third party as a result of unauthorized use of the information.  4.3 Nature of the Blockchain—Eternal Records  One of the great challenges faced by data protection in the twenty-ﬁrst century is the combined advances in data retention, data cataloging, and data search capabilities. As we create more and more data on our lives and as these data are cataloged and easily searched, the data becomes eternal and visible to the general public in a way that has never before been. The technology of blockchain is likely to accelerate this trend. One of the as-advertised advantages of blockchain is that it records all transactions back to the genesis block in order to keep records almost perfectly. As the types of transactions stored in blockchains increase, eternal records of each transaction will increase. In the future, it will be possible for every transaction you undertake to be   218  N. Gupta  stored on a blockchain and you will have no control over where this information is stored or how it is used and no way to delete it. There are numerous concerns about privacy  and laws  involved in these eternal records. To begin with, the simple fact that these records exist could pose problems for anyone who does not want to have a complete record of all their transactions for all time. In addition, there is currently no clear agreement on who “owns “the information in these records as a legal matter. It is possible that blockchain networks could sell the information contained in these records without any input from the persons involved in the transactions, and these persons would not have recourse. In the absence of clear ownership rules, public bodies and private citizens may also have access to these data without the consent of the persons involved in the transaction. In blockchains with a weak or no central authority, it can be impossible to correct bad data that enters the chain.  5 Types of Attacks  In this section, we have tried to analyze the real attacks on blockchain systems, and have discussed the vulnerabilities associated with these attacks.  5.1 Selﬁsh Mining Attack  The attack on selﬁsh mining is carried out by attackers  i.e., selﬁsh miners  in order to obtain undue rewards or to lose the computer power of honest miners. The attacker privately holds discovered blocks and tries to forge a private chain. Afterward, selﬁsh miners mine in this private chain and try to keep a private branch longer than the public branch because they hold more newly discovered blocks in private. Meanwhile, honest miners are continuing to exploit the public chain. New blocks mined by the attacker would be revealed when the public branch approaches the length of the private branch, so that honest miners end up with a loss of computing power and no reward, as selﬁsh miners publish their new blocks just before honest miners. As a result, selﬁsh miners gain a competitive advantage and honest miners are encouraged to join the selﬁsh miners’ branch. This attack undermines the decentralization nature of the blockchain by further consolidating the mining power in favor of the attacker. A Selﬁsh-Mine attack strategy was proposed that can force honest miners to perform wasteful computations on the stale public sector. The length of the public chain and the private chain are the same in the initial circumstances of Selﬁsh-Mine. The Selﬁsh-Mine involves the following three scenarios:   a  The public chain is more long than the private one. Since the computing power of selﬁsh miners may be smaller than that of honest miners, selﬁsh miners update the private chain according to the public chain, and in this scenario, selﬁsh miners cannot reward themselves.   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  219   b  The ﬁrst new block is found almost simultaneously by selﬁsh miners and honest miners. In this scenario, selﬁsh miners publish the newly discovered block and two forks of the same length will be present at the same time. Honest miners in either branch, while selﬁsh miners in the private chain continue to mine. If selﬁsh miners ﬁrst ﬁnd a new block, they will immediately publish that block. At this stage, selﬁsh miners receive two blocks of rewards simultaneously. Since the private chain is longer than the public chain, the private chain is the ultimate branch of industry. If honest miners ﬁrst ﬁnd the second new block and this block is written into the private chain, selﬁsh miners receive the ﬁrst new block and honest miners receive the second new block. Otherwise, if this block is written in the public block, honest miners will receive the rewards of these two new blocks and selﬁsh miners won’t receive any rewards.   c  They also ﬁnd the second new block after the selﬁsh miners ﬁnd the ﬁrst new block. In this scenario, these two new blocks are held privately by selﬁsh miners and continue to mine new blocks in the private chain. When honest miners ﬁnd the ﬁrst new block, selﬁsh miners release their own new block. When honest miners ﬁnd the second new block, selﬁsh miners publish their own new block immediately. This response will then be followed by selﬁsh miners, until the public chain length is only 1 larger than the private chain, after which selﬁsh miners will publish their last new block before honest miners ﬁnd this block. The private chain is considered valid at this point and consequently, selﬁsh miners gain the rewards of all new blocks.  Some other attacks that exploit smart contracts’ vulnerabilities are:  5.2 DAO Attack  Attack case  King of the Ether throne Multiplayer games Rubixi attack Governmental attack  Dynamic libraries attack  Related vulnerabilities  Out-of-gas send, exception disorder Field disclosure Immutable bug Immutable bug, stack overﬂow, unpredictable state, timestamp dependence Unpredictable state  The DAO is an intelligent contract deployed in Ethereum on May 28, 2016 that implements a platform for crowd ﬁnancing. The DAO contract was only attacked after 20 days had been deployed. Prior to the attack, DAO had already raised $150 million, the largest crowdfund ever. The attacker stole approximately US$ 60 million. In this case, the attacker exploited the reentrancy vulnerability. First, the attacker publishes a malicious intelligent contract that includes a withdrawal    call to the DAO function in its callback. The withdrawal    sends Ether to the street, which also has a call form.   220  N. Gupta  It will therefore invoke the callback function of the malicious intelligent contract again. The attacker can thus steal the entire Ether from the DAO. There are 15 more cases that exploit smart contracts’ vulnerabilities.  5.3 BGP Hijacking Attack  BGP is a de facto routing protocol that regulates how IP packets are sent to their destination. In order to intercept blockchain network trafﬁc, the attackers can either use or manipulate BGP routing. BGP hijacking typically requires network operators to be controlled, which could be used to delay network messages. Many authors have thoroughly analyzed the impact of routing attacks on Bitcoin, including both node and network attacks, and have shown that the number of Internet preﬁxes successfully hijacked depends on the distribution of mining power. Due to the high centralization of some Bitcoin mining pools, it will have a signiﬁcant effect if they are attacked by BGP hijacking. The attackers can divide the Bitcoin network effectively or delay block propagation speed. The attackers hijack BGP to intercept the connections of Bitcoin miners to a mining pool server analyzed by Dell SecureWorks in 2014. By redirecting trafﬁc to an attacker-controlled mining pool, the victim’s cryptocurrency could be stolen. This attack raised an estimated cryptocurrency of US$ 83,000 over a period of 2 months. Since BGP security extensions are not widely used, network operators must rely on surveillance systems that report rogue announcements, such as BGP-Mon. However, even if an attack is detected, it still costs hours to solve a hijacking, because it is a human-driven process that changes the conﬁguration or disconnects the attacker. For example, YouTube ever took about 3 hours to resolve a hijacking of its preﬁxes by a Pakistani ISP  Internet Service Provider .  5.4 Eclipse Attack  Some other attacks caused by the eclipse attack are:  cid:129  Engineering block races that lead to the loss of mining power on orphan blocks.  cid:129  Splitting mining power that can cause a 51% vulnerability to be triggered.  cid:129  Selﬁsh mining attackers can earn more than normal mining rewards.  cid:129  0-double spending conﬁrmation: the vendor would not receive rewards for its service.  cid:129  Double conﬁrmation.  The eclipse attack allows an attacker to monopolize all incoming and outgoing links between the victim and the other network peers. The attacker can then ﬁl- ter the victim’s view of the blockchain or allow the victim to use obsolete views of the blockchain for unnecessary computing power. In addition, the attacker can leverage the computing power of the victim to perform his own malicious acts. The   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  221  authors considered two types of eclipse attacks on the peer-to-peer network of Bit- coin, namely botnet attacks and infrastructure attacks. The botnet attack is started with bots with a variety of IP addresses. The attack on infrastructure models the threat from an ISP, company or nation state with adjacent IP addresses. The Bitcoin network may be disrupted and the view of a victim of the blockchain is ﬁltered due to the eclipse attack. An eclipse attack is also a useful base for other attacks.  5.5 Liveness Attack  Liveness attack is an attack that can delay the conﬁrmation time of a target transaction as much as possible. They also show two instances of this attack against Bitcoin and Ethereum. The attack consists of three phases, namely the attack preparation phase, the denial phase of the transaction, and the blockchain retardation phase.  cid:129  Phase of attack preparation: Like a selﬁsh mining attack, an attacker gains advan- tage over honest miners somehow before TX is transmitted to the public chain. The assailant builds the private chain longer than the public chain.  cid:129  Transaction denial phase. The attacker holds privately the block containing TX to prevent TX from being placed in the public chain.  cid:129  Blockchain retarder phase. In the growth process of the public chain, TX cannot be held in private for a certain period of time. The attacker will, in this case, publish the block containing TX. When the depth of the block containing TX is higher than a constant, TX is considered valid in some blockchain systems. The attacker will therefore continue to build a private chain to build an advantage over the public chain.  The attacker will then publish its blocks in private into the public chain in good time to slow the growth rate of the public chain. The liveliness attack ends when TX is checked in the public chain as valid.  6 Security Enhancement to Blockchain Systems  In this section, we summarize security enhancements to blockchain systems, which can be used in the development of blockchain systems.  6.1 SmartPool  As mentioned above, there is already a mining pool with over 40% of the total blockchain computing power. This poses a serious threat to the nature of   222  N. Gupta  TXs  Smartpool Client  Parity  or geth  Tasks  Completed Shares  Share Batches  Rewards  Fig. 2 Execution process of smart pool  Miner  Smartpool Contract  Share Batches  Rewards  decentralization, making blockchain vulnerable to attacks of various kinds. Figure 2 shows the execution process of SmartPool:  SmartPool receives Ethereum node client transactions  i.e., parity or geth  that contain information about mining tasks. The miner then performs a task-based hacking calculation and returns the completed shares to the SmartPool client. When the number of the shares completed reaches a certain amount, they are committed to the Ethereum SmartPool contract. The SmartPool contract veriﬁes shares and provides the customer with rewards. SmartPpool system has the following advan- tages in comparison to traditional P2P pool:   a  Decentralized: The core of the SmartPool is implemented in the form of an intelligent contract in a blockchain. Miners ﬁrst need to connect to Ethereum to me via the customer. The mining pool can rely on the consensus mechanism of Ethereum. In this way, the nature of pool miners is decentralized. The state of the mining pool is maintained by Ethereum and the pool operator is no longer required.   b  Efﬁciency: Miners can send the completed shares in batches to the SmartPool contract. In addition, miners must only send part of the shares to be veriﬁed, not all of the shares. SmartPool is, therefore, more efﬁcient than the P2P pool.  c  Secure: SmartPool uses a new data structure that can prevent the attacker from re-sending shares in various batches. In addition, the SmartPool veriﬁcation method can guarantee that honest miners will receive expected rewards even if there are malicious miners in the pool.  6.2 Quantitative Framework  There exist trade-offs between blockchain’s performance and security. The ﬁgure below shows the framework:   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  223  a Consensus Protocol Parameters b  Network Parameters  Stale Block Rate  Blockchain Simulator  Security Parameters  Security Model  a  Block Propagation Times b  Block Sizes c  Network Delay and throughput  a  Optimal Adversarial Strategy b  Security Provisions  Fig. 3 Components of quantitative framework  There are two components to the quantitative framework: blockchain stimula- tor and safety model. The stimulator imitates the execution of the blockchain, the inputs of which are consent protocol and network parameters. It can gain perfor- mance statistics of the target blockchain by analyzing the simulator, including block propagation times, block sizes, network delays, block rate, throughput, etc. The stale block refers to a block mined in the public chain, but not written. The transaction throughput is the number of transactions that the blockchain can handle. Stale block rate is transferred as a parameter to the component of the security model, which is based on MDP  Markov Decision Processes  to defeat double spending and selﬁsh mining. The framework ultimately produces an optimal adversarial strategy against attacks and facilitates the establishment of security measures  Fig. 3 .  6.3 Oyente  Oyente has been proposed to detect bugs in intelligent contracts with Ethereum. Oyente uses symbolic execution to analyze the bytecode of intelligent contracts and complies with the EVM execution model. Since Ethereum stores smart contract bytecodes in its blockchain, Oyente can be used to detect bugs in contracts deployed. Figure 4 shows the architecture and execution process of Oyenet.  It takes the bytecode and the Ethereum global state of the smart contract as inputs. First, based on bytecode, CFG BUILDER will statically build smart contract CFG  Control Flow Graph . According to Ethereum and CFG information, EXPLORER simulates the execution of intelligent contracts by leveraging static symbolic perfor- mance. In this process, CFG will be further enriched and improved because some jump targets are not constants; they should instead be calculated during symbolic performance. The CORE ANALYSIS module detects four different vulnerabilities using the related analysis algorithms. The VALIDATOR module conﬁrms the vulner-   224  N.

Conﬁrmed vulnerability and CFG information are ﬁnally displayed in the VISUALIZER module, which users can use to debug and analyze the program. Oyente is currently the open source for public use.  6.4 Hawk  Leakage of privacy is a serious threat to blockchain. In the era of blockchain 2.0, not only transactions but also contractual information are public, such as bytecodes of contracts, parameters of invoking, etc. Hawk is a new framework proposed for the development of intelligent contracts to preserve privacy. Using Hawk, the devel- opers can write smart private contracts and they do not have to use any encryption or obstruction code. Furthermore, the ﬁnancial transaction’s information will not be explicitly stored in blockchain. When programmers develop Hawk contract, the contract can be divided into two parts: private portion and public portion. The private data and ﬁnancial function related codes can be written into the private portion, and codes that do not involve private information can be written into the public portion. The Hawk contract is compiled into three pieces.   a  A program to be executed on all virtual node machines, just like Ethereum’s  smart contracts.   b  The program executed by smart contract users only.  c  The program to be carried out by the manager who is a special trustworthy Hawk party. The Hawk Manager is executed in the Intel SGX enclave and you can see the contract privacy information, but it won’t.  Hawk can protect not only privacy from the public, but also privacy between various Hawk contracts. If the manager aborts the Hawk protocol, it is automatically penalized ﬁnancially and users receive compensation. In general, Hawk can protect the privacy of users when using blockchain in large part.   Security and Privacy Issues of Blockchain Technology  225  7 Future Directions  On the basis of the above systematic examination of the safety of current blockchain systems, we list some future directions for encouraging research in this ﬁeld. First, the most common consensus mechanism in blockchain today is PoW. But the waste of computer resources is a major disadvantage of PoW. Ethereum tries to develop a hybrid consensus mechanism between PoW and PoS in order to solve this problem. Research and the development of more efﬁcient consensus mechanisms will play an important role in the development of blockchain. Second, with the increase in the number of feature-rich dAPPs, the risk of blockchain leakage in privacy will be more serious. Both a dAPP itself and the communication process between the dAPP and the internet face risks to privacy. Some interesting techniques can be used in this problem: code obfuscation, application hardening, computing with trust  e.g., Intel SGX , etc. Third, the blockchain generates a lot of data, including block data, transaction data, bytecode, etc. All the data stored in blockchain is not valid, however. For example, an intelligent contract may delete its code by SUICIDE or SELFDESTRUCT, but the contact address is not deleted. In addition, there are many intelligent contracts that do not contain a code or completely the same code in Ethereum and many intelligent contracts are never executed after their deployment. To improve the performance efﬁciency of blockchain systems, an efﬁcient data cleanup, and detection mechanism is required.  8 Conclusions  Although a lot of studies have been carried out on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, but a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems is still missing. In this chapter, we have tried to demonstrate a systematic illustration on the security threats to blockchain and presented a detailed description related to the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We have discussed the security and the privacy of blockchain along with their impact with regards to different trends and applications in this chapter. The chapter has focused on the key security attacks and the enhancements that will help develop better blockchain systems.  References  1.

Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  Malaya Dutta Borah, Vadithya Bharath Naik, Ripon Patgiri, Aditya Bhargav, Barneel Phukan and Shiva G. M. Basani  Abstract Blockchains play a vital role in FARMAR to track and trace the origin of food products in food supply chain. Supply Chain Management  SCM  is an essential business process in all spheres of the economy. SCM uses speciﬁc processes to con- nect from producer to consumer requirement through a chain. In a BCT Blockchain Technology  based system, “records are immutable and trusted, eliminating the need for third parties to be involved. Potential farmer-facing impacts include ensuring that farmers receive timely and complete payments through the use of smart contracts and helping farmers to capture real-time data to more effectively manage their crops and harvests  source: nextbillion.net ”. Another beneﬁt of using BCT in FARMAR is security where hacking or tampering the existing data is impossible by any interme- diary. As an add-on to this process, IoT devices  Mobile phone-based Android app  are used to update the real-time quality and transit time of the product in FARMAR. It is integrated for improved traceability and usability of the products in the supply chain. The FARMAR aims to achieve these goals by developing a web application where FARMAR creates a value chain of integrity from farm to fork by using BCT.  M. D. Borah  B  · V. B. Naik · R. Patgiri · A.

Borah et al.  chain management  1 Introduction to Blockchain Technology  Agriculture plays a vital role where it accounts an 18% of India’s Gross Domestic Product, as well as, it accounts for employment to 50% of the countries workforce. India is the world’s largest producer of pulses, rice, wheat, spices, and spice prod- ucts. From the producer  farmer  down to the consumer, the agricultural supply chain in India is plagued by inefﬁcient intermediaries. Information regarding prices, sup- plies, and stocks are asymmetrically distributed among the middle man farmer and consumer. Though the improvement of this said problem has been addressed by the various planning and management techniques like Material Requirement Planning, Enterprise Resource Planning, and Advanced Supply Chain Planning and Optimiza- tion, there still exists a lack of Transparency, Trust, and Centralized authority [1].  To address the above issue, we proposed a novel project for Supply Chain Man- agement in Agriculture using Blockchain called FARMAR  FARMer And Rely . FARMAR embeds Blockchain Technology  BCT , which has emerged in recent years and it plays a key role in the agricultural supply chain management to resolve this problem. Blockchain is a decentralized Distributed Ledger Technology  DLT  which is used to store data of a supply chain, which in turn cannot be tampered with. Each block has a hash and pre-hash Signature Value linking them together. The transactions are administered in a distributed system in fully decentralized servers. Once the data in the block is entered committed, it cannot be altered. All the data is cryptographically secure.  The blockchain is a new approach to data storage and transmission that has great potential for agriculture, both for agribusiness and consumers. It is undoubtedly attractive, combining cryptography to guarantee the integrity and permanence of data, a peer-to-peer architecture that avoids centralizing intermediaries, and principles of collective governance where each player can access transactions and guarantee their legitimacy. As such, the blockchain promises increased trust, transparency, and ﬂuidity of transactions within multi-stakeholder systems [2].  Features of Blockchain Technology BigchainDB doesn’t enhance, rather, it builds upon blockchain technology. It adds blockchain characteristics like decentralized control, immutability, and the transfer of digital assets by starting with a big data distributed database.  cid:129  Decentralization: It means there is no single point of control and failure. A fed- eration of voting nodes constitute a P2P network and works through decentralized control.   Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  229   cid:129  Immutability: It means it is more than only tamper-resistant. Data once stored can’t be deleted or changed.  cid:129  Query: any MongoDB query can be written and run to search the contents of all stored transactions, assets, metadata and blocks. It is powered by MongoDB itself.  cid:129  Customizable: We are designing the public network with custom assets, trans- actions, permissions and transparency using four nodes  for example, I said four nodes but here anyone can act as server and database to achieve true decentraliza- tion .  2 How BigchainDB is Decentralized  Decentralization implies that control or ownership is not in the hands of a single node or entity. There is no single point of failure. Ownership and control of all nodes lie with different people and organization. It is preferable to let different persons or subdivisions control separate nodes, even if they form a part of the same organization. The set of people and or organizations responsible for managing the nodes of a BigchainDB network is called a BigchainDB consortium. In order to take decisions for membership, it requires some form of administration and governance. Each consortium determines what the details of the governance process are it can be very decentralized. Decentralization can be increased by each consortium by increasing its jurisdictional diversity and geographic diversity. The position of a node in the BigchainDB network is not permanent. All nodes are equal in terms of status and performance of duties. Getting admin access to a node can lead to tampering with that node  e.g., one can update or delete data stored on that node , but those changes are limited only to that particular node. Only if more than a third of all the nodes get compromised, the network can be breached. The power to transfer assets doesn’t lie with even the admin or super user of a node. To create a valid transfer transaction, we have to satisfy the present crypto-conditions on the asset. The admin superuser can’t do that as he she doesn’t possess the required information  e.g., private keys   source: docs.bigchaindb.com .  cid:129  No APIs for changing or deleting data. BigchainDB doesn’t have any API that can be used to modify or delete data in a blockchain. It can be perceived of as a line of defense.  cid:129  Replication. All the data is copied to many other places. Increase in the replication factor implies more difﬁculty in modifying or deleting all the copies replicas.  cid:129  Internal watchdogs. All nodes monitor all changes and if some unallowed change happens, then appropriate action can be taken.  cid:129  External watchdogs. A consortium can delegate monitoring and auditing of their data to trusted third parties. The public can also act as an auditor if a consortium has data that is publicly readable .   230  M. D. Borah et al.   cid:129  Economic incentives. Modifying old stored data may be pretty expensive in some blockchain systems. For example, proof-of-work and proof-of-stake sys- tems. BigchainDB doesn’t use any of the explicit incentives like these. Data can be stored using better techniques, e.g., error-correction codes, so that some changes can be easier to undo.  cid:129  Cryptographic signatures are used to monitor if messages  e.g., transactions  have been tampered with. Also, they verify the identity of the people who signed the messages. A single party or multiple parties must sign each transaction.  cid:129  Full or partial backups can be recorded timely on magnetic tape storage, other blockchains, printouts, etc.  cid:129  Strong security. Tough security policies may be adopted and enforced by owners of nodes.  cid:129  Node diversity. Because of the diversity, just one thing  e.g., natural disaster or operating system bug  can’t compromise all or enough of the nodes.  cid:129  BigchainDB combines an enterprise-grade distributed database  MongoDB  with a production-ready consensus engine  Tendermint  to provide the beneﬁts of both.  3 Difference Between Traditional Database and Blockchain  Database  Traditional databases are MySQL, MongoDB, and Postgre. CRUD operations can be done in these databases [3, 4]; it means anybody can edit, copy, remove, delete, or update the documents and hence, the security is breached. Whereas, blockchain is a secured database where you can’t do any CRUD operations. It means nobody can edit, delete, or tamper data and the transactions are secured. Traditional databases are centralized in a central server but blockchain database is decentralized throughout many servers.  Asset Databases Assets are the goods, which will be digitally stored in the blockchain database. Every asset will have its digital twin with a public key and private key. These digitally stored assets will be secured. All the assets will be tracked using the public key. The assets can be anything. tomatoes, mangoes, milk products, etc.  The assets will be stored in the blockchain database in asset collection and perfect chain of that asset alongside transaction will be maintained. When consumers will scan the QR code using the mobile application, all the transactions of the asset will be retrieved with perfect data analytics on the asset from asset collection in blockchain database.  The security of assets is guaranteed by the use of blockchain technology. Through- out the agricultural supply chain, at each step, we record the transactions between   Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  231  the shareholders. This ensures the maintenance of quality of the asset as it transits through the supply chain. In this way, any malpractice or dishonest handling of the asset can be caught  Fig. 1 .  Blockchain in Agricultural Supply Chain System Supply Chain Management  SCM  is an essential business process in all spheres of the economy. SCM uses speciﬁc processes to connect from producer to consumer’s requirement through a chain.  The existing problems that prevail in the agriculture supply chain are:   cid:129  Rampant corruption among the middlemen.  cid:129  Lack of transparency in the whole chain as goods transit through the chain.  cid:129  Lack of accountability on the part of all the stakeholders involved.  cid:129  In order to solve these, we envision developing a blockchain enabled system that manages the whole agricultural supply chain while enforcing a high standard of security and transparency.  In the context of Supply Chain, blockchain plays a vital role as decentralized Distributed Ledger Technology  DLT  which is used to store data of a supply chain, which in turn cannot be tampered with. Each block has a hash and pre-hash Signature Value linking them together. The transactions are administered in a distributed system in a fully decentralized way. Once the data in the block is entered, it cannot be altered. All the data is cryptographically secure.  According to a report in Press Information Bureau  PIB , the total wastage in agri- culture product with or without using blockchain technology is depicted as follows:  Group  Within agricultural supply chains, blockchains play a vital role. First, track and trace the origin of food products [5]. As an addon to this process, IoT devices will be used to update the real-time quality of the product. The Raspberry Pi  IoT  that runs on Raspbian OS is used to give the quality of the soil and the current temperature of the place from where the product transits. It is integrated for improved traceability and usability of the products of the supply chain [6].  The FARMAR aims to achieve these goals by developing a web application where we can create a value chain of integrity from farm to fork by using BCT  BigchainDB, Tendermint, MongoDB, Smart Contracts, MONIT, Python, NodeJS, Docker Dae- mon  and IoT [7].  4 Use Case Application of Blockchain Technology  There is no denying that agricultural supply chain is the essential supply chain that impacts our everyday lives. A farmer sells his product to a distributor who in turn, stocks it across his various warehouses and supplies it to the retailers.   232  M. D.

This supply chain network has the geographical reach, as well as the scale up capability to take care of ﬂuctuating supply and demand. The distribution network itself comprises of many players who have the logistics capability to handle the supply chain at local and global levels  source: radiostud.io . To eliminate the middleman in the supply chain management, blockchain technology can help in the following manner. This process consists of series of steps that are going to work in actual SCM where at each and every point an IoT device is kept for tracking and all the data is added in the blockchain network through a shared ledger  Fig. 2 .  Objective of the Work The objective of this work is to:  cid:129  Design of a decentralized and secured supply chain management system.  cid:129  Reduction in the number of middlemen in the system.  cid:129  Increased cost efﬁciency.  cid:129  Enhanced quality of goods.  cid:129  Sustainable development of India’s GDP in the long run. Facilitate fast and trans- parent delivery of products.  5 Existing Methods  In the traditional supply chain method, there is no traceability and accountability. The prices of goods can be artiﬁcially inﬂated at will by the intermediaries at the expense of the farmers and consumers. Dishonesty and corruption are rampant in the existing supply chain. There is no way for consumers of ascertaining the quality   234  M. D. Borah et al.  of goods they buy. Farmers are deprived of their fair share and the intermediaries exploit them and take away the bulk of proﬁts.  6 FARMAR––The Proposed Method  Background of the Proposed Work The agricultural supply chain has a vital impact on our everyday lives. To eliminate the middleman in the supply chain management, blockchain technology can help in the following manner.  cid:129  This process consists of series of steps that are going to work in actual SCM where at each and every point an IoT device is kept for tracking and all the data is added in the blockchain network through a shared ledger.  7 Experimental Setup and Tools Used  BigchainDB We will implement our application using BigchainDB as a database with blockchain characteristics. It has high throughput, low latency, powerful query functionality, decentralized control, immutable data storage, and built-in asset support. Developers and enterprises can deploy blockchain proof of concepts, platforms, and applications with a blockchain database, supporting a wide range of industries and use cases. We used BigchainDB version 2.0b9 using pip and docker for installation. In order to start a BigchainDB server, it requires to download from a GitHub repository of BigchainDB, a Python package library and perform a docker operations on it or else make normal installation from a Python pip.  Structuring our data is the most important thing to learn and understand about BigchainDB. Data is structured in tables in traditional SQL databases. Other data structuring formats are used to structure data in NoSQL databases like JSON, key values, and tables. Data is structured as assets in BigchainDB. Anything can be perceived and represented as an asset. Any digital or physical object can be thought of as an asset. For example, a car, a data set, or an intellectual property right.  Linux  UBUNTU  We used Linux  Ubuntu 16.04 and above during the development phase  operating system for easy, fast installation, and setup. As Linux is open source, it is easy for anyone to ﬁx some issues with Linux and there is a good community support for this. It also supports several operating systems. Ubuntu is convenient to handle and it is secure for decentralized network without any system faults. The Linux terminal plays a crucial role in production.   Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  235  Python 3.6 During the development and testing phase, we used a new version of PYTHON and PIP. In the nearby future, we are also looking to develop the same thing in Node.js.  Monit We used Monit  s Watchdog  for system monitoring and ﬁxing errors. One cannot make sure that all the servers are running excellent all the time. Sometimes tendermint works good but there will be a problem in MongoDB, if MongoDB works ﬁne, then BigchainDB shoots some errors and we cannot make all the servers running on each terminal. So, Monit ensures and starts all the servers at a time by giving the process ID, and it also shows the status of the system  we can also check the system status, process, ﬁlesystem, process, hosts, etc., for every time set by us .  How to Connect to MongoDB We must connect to it a MongoDB database before we query it. To do that, what is needed to know its hostname and port. If a BigchainDB node is being run on a local machine  e.g., for development and test , then the hostname should be local host and the port should be 27017, unless we did something to change those values. The same holds true, when a BigchainDB node is being run on a remote machine and we can SSH to that machine. If a BigchainDB node is being run on a remote machine and its MongoDB has been conﬁgured to use auth and to be publicly accessible  to people with authorization , then perhaps, we can ﬁgure out its port and hostname  source: docs.bigchaindb.com   Fig. 3 .  Fig. 3 A four-node BlockchainDB 2.0 network. Source http:  docs.bigchaindb.com en latest  query.html   236  M. D. Borah et al.  Querying BigchainDB In order to search and query stored data  transactions, assets, and metadata , the complete power of MongoDB query engine can be used by the operator of a node. The decision as to how much of the query power they should expose to other external users lies with the node operators themselves.  An operator of a BigchainDB node has full access to their local MongoDB instance. Hence, they can in order to run queries, they may use any MongoDB APIs, such as the Mongo Shell, MongoDB Compass, one of the MongoDB drivers, like PyMongo, or a third-party tool for doing MongoDB queries. Some collections in the Bigchain database are:  cid:129  Transactions  cid:129  Assets  cid:129  Metadata  cid:129  Blocks  cid:129  and also you will get some other collections when you check the MongoDB database while BigchainDB server running on the background.  Example Documents from Transactions A CREATE is a transaction of the transactions’ collection. It includes an extra “_id” ﬁeld  added by MongoDB  and is missing the “asset” and “metadata” ﬁelds is miss- ing, because that data was removed and stored in the assets and metadata collections.  A TRANSFER is a transaction from the transactions’ collection. It keeps its  “asset” ﬁeld.   Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  237  Example Document  of Assets  A document from the assets collection consists of three top-level ﬁelds: an “_id” ﬁeld which is added by MongoDB, the asset.data from a CREATE transaction, and the “id” of the CREATE transaction that it came from.  Example Document  of Metadata : From the metadata collection, a document has three top-level ﬁelds: an “_id” ﬁeld that is added by MongoDB, the metadata from a transaction, and the “id” of the transaction from which it came from.  Example Document  of Blocks    238  M. D. Borah et al.  8 BigchainDB and Smart Contracts  The source code of a smart contract  which is basically a computer program  can be stored in BigchainDB. But arbitrary smart contracts can’t be run on BigchainDB. It can be used to enforce permissions for both fungible and non-fungible asset transfers. Double-spending will thus be prevented. Putting it another way, a BigchainDB net- work can be used instead of an ERC-20  fungible token  or ERC-721  non-fungible token  smart contract. Asset transfer permissions can also be interpreted as write per- missions. Hence, writing to a log, journal, or audit trail can be controlled by them. Through oracles or interchain communications protocols, A BigchainDB network can be connected to other blockchain networks. Thus, in order to run arbitrary smart contracts, BigchainDB can be used as part of a solution that uses other blockchains.  How to Set Up a BigchainDB Network The node operators called members must share some information with each other, so they can form a network. We use Tendermint for maintaining and making decen- tralized network or nodes.  Each BigchainDB node is identiﬁed by its:   cid:129  Hostname  cid:129  Tendermint.pub_key.value  cid:129  Tendermint node_id.  The Tendermint ﬁle should look like:  To get your Tendermint node_id, run the command:  tendermint show_node_id  At this point, the Coordinator should have received the data from all the Members,  and should combine them in the ﬁle $HOME .tendermint conﬁg genesis.json.   Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  239  Member: Connect to the Other Members: At this point, the Member should have received the genesis.json ﬁle. The Member must copy the genesis.json ﬁle into their local $HOME .tendermint conﬁg directory. Every Member now shares the same chain_id and genesis_time  used to identify the Network , and the same list of validators.  Each Member must edit their $HOME .tendermint conﬁg conﬁg.toml ﬁle and  make the following changes.   240  M. D. Borah et al.  Member: Start MongoDB If MongoDB is already using sudo apt install mongodb, then MongoDB should already be running in the background.  The three main steps leading to the submission of a transaction to a BigchainDB  node are: 1. Preparation of the transaction payload; 2. Fulﬁllment of the prepared transaction payload; 3. Sending the transaction payload through HTTPS.  Steps 1 and 2 can be done ofﬂine on the client. They don’t need any connection  to any of the BigchainDB nodes.  For the sake of convenience, a few utilities are provided for the preparation and fulﬁllment of a transaction through the BigchainDB class, and through the off chain module. To introduce the use of these utilities, we shall:  cid:129  Provide all the values, including the default ones, and we shall also generate the transaction id;  cid:129  Use crypto-conditions to generate a condition which locks the transaction, thus;  cid:129  Protecting it from an unauthorized user;  cid:129  Use crypto-conditions in order to produce a fulﬁllment that unlocks the transaction asset; and  cid:129  Subsequently, enact an ownership transfer.  To perform the above, we shall use the following Python libraries:   cid:129  JSON: for serializing the transaction dictionary into a JSON formatted string;  cid:129  SHA-3: for hashing the serialized transaction; and  cid:129  crypto-conditions: for creating conditions and fulﬁllments. Sending a Transaction to the Network To send it over to BigchainDB, we have different options. You can choose from three different methods to change the broadcasting API used in Tendermint. By choosing a mode, a new transaction can be pushed with a different mode. The recommended mode for basic usages is commit, which will wait until the transaction is committed to a block or a timeout is reached. The sync mode will return after the transaction is validated, while async will return right away.   Supply Chain Management in Agriculture Using Blockchain and IoT  241  9 Conclusion  This work implements a user-friendly web-based platform in Agricultural Supply Chain Management using blockchain technology, which is a decentralized secured system to get transparency, enhanced product quality. The producers  farmers  will get fair prices for their produce, and their chances of getting duped by unscrupulous middlemen on account of their illiteracy are greatly reduced. Use of blockchain enables traceability of the asset. From the farmer to the consumer, throughout the supply chain, we can keep trace the asset. We can ensure that the asset has not been tampered with. Also, the whole supply chain will become more accountable. Artiﬁcial inﬂation of prices for the dishonest proﬁt of intermediaries can be curbed. The consumers will also be beneﬁtted as they will not be paying inﬂated prices for the goods they buy. This, in turn, will improve the overall standard of living of the society.  References  1.

Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  Sundaresan Muthukrishnan and Boopathy Duraisamy  Abstract The blockchain is authorizing digital information to be scattered, but not copied, and it also created the backbone of a new type of Internet. It is an open infrastructure with blocks of information connected mutually that contain references to the preceding block. It is a decentralized and distributed system like an open ledger that stores a registry of assets and transactions in a peer-to-peer network  i.e., P2P . Artiﬁcial Intelligence is a part of computer science sector that emphasizes the design of intelligent machines that work, things, and reacts like human beings. It is the theory and practice of constructing machines capable of performing tasks that seem to require intelligence. It includes machine learning, artiﬁcial neural networks, and deep learning concepts. Blockchain and merger of AI into mainstream products and its related services can generate plenty of opportunities for enterprises. This chapter discusses the capabilities recognized at the intersection of AI and Blockchain and also discuss about the standard deﬁnitions, beneﬁts, and challenges of this alliance.

Blockchain has a history which is a decade past. Currently, the blockchain is used in many industries other than the cryptocurrencies  S. Muthukrishnan  B  · B.

Duraisamy  to maintain the non-modiﬁcation of the data. In future, the blockchain technology may be adopted in maximum number of sectors and moreover, it leads to bring secured transaction and communications.  2 History of Blockchain  The novel technologies need a motivation to design and implement. From the 1990s, the concept of Distributed Computing has been adopted widely by service sectors. The origin of Bitcoin has taken place in 2009, and Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and introduced the concept of blockchain to incorporate a decentralized ledger main- tained by anonymous consensus. In 2011–2012, the deployment of cryptocurrency in application related to cash was taking place. In 2012–2013, the currency transfer and digital payments system was introduced by using the Bitcoin transactions. In the year 2013–2014, ﬁnancial markets and applications started using blockchain-related transactions beyond the cash transactions.  While the bitcoin transactions were getting smarter and safer by using the blockchain concept, then they were starting to adopt the same methodology into the sensitive online contents. In 2014–2015, by using blockchain methodologies, the smart contracts were initialized and implemented in the Information Technology sec- tor. In 2015–2016, permissioned blockchain network solutions related applications were attracted and started to develop by many concerns to provide better service to their clients. From 2016 to 2017, the blockchain-based market consolidation and further subdevelopments were started taking place.  3 Recent Trends in Blockchain  The blockchain has formerly been designed and deployed to power the cryptocurren- cies like Bitcoin, but it does not mean, that the other industrial sectors cannot adopt the blockchain methodologies into their different applications. The following sectors are some of the places where blockchain technologies are getting popular [2–5].  3.1 Internet of Things Connectivity  Internet of Things is used to connect the different devices and to construct it easier than ever before to generate and store data concerning the user itself. This implies to wearable devices, home hubs, connected electronic gadgets, and different types of Internet-connected device. The devices which are interconnected will require a new sort of processing system, which ties them together and makes their data   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  245  interoperable. In this situation, the blockchain could be adopted, but the only thing is that the different device manufacturers need to agree to join together and also they need to agree on the required speciﬁcations of the blockchain methodology.  3.2 Increased Use of Smart Contracts  After the Bitcoin transactions impact, the digital contracts are turned into smart contracts due to the interesting aspect of the blockchain technology. Blockchain has the potential to bypass the third parties and also it can create the agreements, i.e., smart contracts with hermetically sealed. The possibilities are arising and adopting in the different industries that include ﬁnance, real estate, logistics, and recruitment. The industries which rely on the agreements to function, they can get their needs to be fulﬁlled by the smart contracts using the blockchain methodology. By default, this will offer the increased security and transparency simultaneously along with a speedy process. Generally, all the agreements and contracts need to be signed and veriﬁed, and the same process can be followed in the smart contract too. Finally, it can make all the possible differences in the industry market.  3.3 Increased Regulation  The blockchain concept was being used widely in most of the different industries, and by default, it will start to get the attention from the lawmakers and the regulatory authorities. This blockchain transactions, have started to attract even the taxman interest, when the government ﬁgure out the ways to utilize the blockchain technology on a large scale. The additional interest from power organizations will lead to help the blockchain technology to increase the consumer’s trust by providing the framework for growth.  3.4 Content Streaming  When the new methodology and concepts are introduced in the Information Tech- nology sector, it must be designed with the scope of ready to adopt by different service sectors. The content streaming is one of the major sections, which cannot be avoided nowadays due to streaming companies like Netﬂix, YouTube. The online streaming companies are needed to store the data securely and pave the technique for interoperability. The streaming companies could observe the massive decreases in their Operating Costs  i.e., OPEX  by scattering the load across idle machines via the blockchain technology.   246  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  These are some of the sectors where the blockchain technology is started using widely and which leads to encourage the other industries to adopt this methodology in upcoming future.  4 Future Trends in Blockchain  Every technology is designed with the scope of the pipeline process. In the same way, the blockchain technology is also designed with the future scope. Some of the trends which are going to take place in the blockchain are discussed in this section [6].  4.1 Blockchain-as-a-Service  BaaS   Blockchain-as-a-service is also deﬁned as BaaS. In blockchain methodology, to cre- ate blockchain, maintain and manage that blockchain solution is difﬁcult. These things will be taken care of by the service providers who are providing BaaS. The users are allowed to build their blockchain-related products including applications, smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions without creating and managing the blockchain-based infrastructure. Some of the online services providing compa- nies like Microsoft have already started providing these services to their clients and customers.  4.2 Hybrid Blockchains  Some of the versions of blockchain are already in use. But this is the right time to bring the hybrid blockchain into the action to provide better services to the diverse clients. The hybrid blockchain will be a combination of merging the features and functionality of the private and public blockchain. The government cannot adopt the decentralized public blockchain and also they cannot utilize the private blockchain as it is since they must interact with the public. By using the hybrid blockchain, the government can offer their best services in customizable solution without affecting the transparency, integrity, and security.  4.3 Federated Blockchain  The federated blockchain is the evolution of the normal blockchain which is designed for speciﬁc use cases. It is also similar to the private blockchain but with a con- volution. Generally, the normal blockchain is managed by a single organization,   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  247  but in federated blockchain, many authorized authorities are able to control it with preselected nodes. The selected group of nodes, which ensured those generated blocks, are validated for processing transactions. The different user cases like supply chain management and insurance claims are taken into the federated blockchain.  4.4 Interoperability Between Blockchains  Blockchain interoperability is the capability to share information transversely with between the different blockchain networks. By using this method, the various blockchain users can perceive and access the information across many blockchain networks. By using the blockchain interoperability a user can send the information from one blockchain network to another blockchain network without any difﬁculty.  4.5 Stable Coins  Cryptocurrencies are basically designed with the blockchain concept, but the cryp- tocurrencies are unstable. This leads to making a rise in the stable coins, i.e., stable coins have stable prices. The stable coins, prices, and values are not affected by the market instability; it ensures that stable coins price at stability mode at all time. The tether is one of the cryptocurrencies, which are coming under the stable coin. However, it is not free from disadvantages: it runs on centralized systems with its related rules and some trust issues between investors due to the centralized concept. These are some of the trends which are going to take place in the future. Most of the mentioned trends are already in the testing and beta mode. Those future trend concepts will lead and take the cryptocurrency usage into the next level.  5 Artiﬁcial Intelligence Past, Present, and Future  As per one online dictionary, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence is deﬁned as, “Artiﬁcial intel- ligence  AI  is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artiﬁcial intelligence are designed for include: Speech recognition, Learning, Plan- ning and Problem solving” [7]. The Artiﬁcial Intelligence hereafter mentioned as AI has recently evolved in many sectors that include decision-making in predicting the Weather Forecasting, Identifying the different disease levels in Medical Fields. The history, recent trends, and future trends of the AI is explained in this section.   248  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  6 History of Artiﬁcial Intelligence  In the era of the 1940 and 1950s, a group of scientists from different ﬁelds which include mathematics, engineering, psychology, political science, and economics began to talk about the possibility of developing an artiﬁcial brain. In academic discipline, Artiﬁcial Intelligence  AI  research was founded in 1956. From the year 1956–1974, different programs were developed. The computers were started for solving algebra, conﬁrming theorems in geometry, and learning about how to speak English. Some of those different problems were attracted by the people and they would have believed that “intelligent” behaviors by machines based on the gen- erated algorithms are possible. In the 1970s, Artiﬁcial Intelligence was focusing on evaluations and monetary setbacks. Artiﬁcial Intelligence researchers had failed to realize the complexity of the issues which were faced by them. Even though there were different issues with the public perception of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in the late 1970 years, novel concepts were explored in commonsense reasoning, logic programming, and many other different areas. In the 1980s, a form of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence program called “expert systems” was adopted by many corporations and Artiﬁcial Intelligence research is focused as a mainstream research. In 1987–2011, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence crossed more than half a century, and ﬁnally, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence achieved a few of its goals.  From 2011 to till present date, the era of Deep learning, big data, and artiﬁcial general intelligence were started. The access to the large volume of data which are deﬁned as Big Data, faster computers and improved and enhanced machine learn- ing concepts was successfully applied to many problems throughout the industrial economy [8].  7 Recent Trends in Artiﬁcial Intelligence  Some of the recent trends in artiﬁcial intelligence are discussed in this section. Only the major areas are explained here and apart from these there are many areas rapidly starting to adopt the Artiﬁcial Intelligence [9–15].  7.1 The Rise of AI-Enabled Chips  Artiﬁcial Intelligence seriously relies on dedicated processors that harmonize the Central Processing Unit  CPU . The best ever and most advanced CPU possibly will not lonely enhance the speed of training an Artiﬁcial Intelligence model. It needs supplementary hardware to execute multifaceted mathematical computations to speed up different tasks such as object detection, object recognition, and facial recognition. The processing chips will need to be optimized for deﬁnite use of cases   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  249  and speciﬁc scenarios, which are related to speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. Some companies have already invested their money and interest in the custom chips which are based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays  FPGA  and Application-Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits  ASIC .  7.2 Convergence of IoT and AI at the Edge  In upcoming years, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence will meet the Internet of Things at the edge computing layer. Most of the Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Internet of Things models will be trained and deployed in the public cloud. The Industrial Internet of Things is placed at the top of utilization case for Artiﬁcial Intelligence and that can execute root cause analysis, outlier detection, and predictive maintenance of the different industrial equipments. Advanced Machine Learning models will become capable of dealing with speech synthesis, time series data, video frames, and unstruc- tured data which were generated by different devices like microphones, cameras, and different sensors.  7.3 Automated Machine Learning Will Gain Prominence  In upcoming years, the Machine Learning-based solutions is fundamentally con- verted into is Automated Machine Learning, i.e., AutoML. The AutoML will autho- rize business analysts and encourage the developers to develop different ML models that can address multifaceted scenarios exclusive of going through the characteristic process of training the Machine Learning models. Automatic Machine Learning, i.e., AutoML can perfectly ﬁt in between cognitive Application Program Interfaces and customized Machine Learning platforms. The AutoML delivers the exact level of customization without forcing the Machine Learning developers to go through the detailed workﬂow.  8 Future Trends in Artiﬁcial Intelligence  The future of Artiﬁcial Intelligence will improve the overall industrial sector into the next level, and it can be adopted and utilized by different interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary sector, and some of the future trends in artiﬁcial intelligence are explained in this section [16].   250  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  8.1 Cognitive Analytics  In cognitive analytics, the machines started to learn from experience and equip it to build associations, provide multivariate help to develop technology systems which evolve hypothesis, plan and draw conclusions, and codify the instincts and experience.  8.2 Smarter Gets Redeﬁned  The smart gets redeﬁned as smarter grids with the advances of using the sensor, cloud computing and Machine Learning, and by using them the Artiﬁcial Intelligence pushes limits of smarter cars, smarter homes, smart infrastructure, and much more smart things into those which are ahead, smart.  8.3 Face-Reading Machines  Face-reading and recognizing machines are used to decipher micro facial expressions to construct signiﬁcant information on the expressive state of the device user, and by default, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence is improving the human–computer interaction, i.e., HCI in the areas of e-learning and e-therapy.  8.4 Intelligent Automation  The Intelligent automation merges computerization with Artiﬁcial Intelligence which permits the acquaintance workers, from physicians to investment analysts and plant supervisors, recognizes and utilizes ballooning quantities of information.  9 Blockchain Responsibilities from Different Visions  Whenever the new technology introduced and getting involved in the industrial sectors, it deﬁnitely got different views by different users. This section explains about the role of blockchain in the industries and its related legal enforcement matters.   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  251  10 Role of Blockchain in Industrials  The major industrial areas of blockchain only are explained in this part, and apart from these discussed areas many industrial sectors can customize the blockchain as per their requirements and usages [17].  10.1 Banking  In the industrial sector, banking is the starting point for the blockchain. In macro prospective manner, the banking sector is acting as a transfer and storehouse of value. The digitization effectively transformed the banking sector into a secure, tamper proof ledger. And also the same could be served by the blockchain which includes injecting the enhanced accuracy in the transactions and digitally information sharing between the different ﬁnancial services.  Currently, the banks around the world like Swiss bank UBS and United Kingdom- based Barclays are experimenting the blockchain in their transaction settlement services and back ofﬁce functions. By default, it will cut off the middlemen costs.  10.2 Voting  Generally, the election authorities need to follow the set of rules to conduct the elections. That requires authenticating the voters by using their identiﬁcation, keeping the record safely to track the votes, and by using those voting records and only the election authorities determine the winner. In upcoming years, the blockchain-based tools could be served as fundamental infrastructure in conducting the election that includes vote casting, vote tracking and vote counting.  It will eliminate the voter fraud and foul play off the table. The voters and gov- ernment can verify and ensure that the cast votes are whether changed, removed or any votes are added illegally.  10.3 Critical Infrastructure Security  The present and available internet architecture have already proven that it is easy to hack. When it comes to the Internet of Things-related devices, those are also under vulnerable part. The government and private sectors are equipping and concentrating to convert the critical infrastructure like transportation and power plants with con- nected servers. Owing to this kind of digital conversion the civil society will face some critical risks.   252  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  The blockchain’s ledger is public, the data communications in the blockchain are using enhanced and improved crypto logical techniques to conﬁrm, whether the data are received from correct sources and also that nothing is intruded in the interim of the data transmission. While adopting the blockchain widely, the hacking sector will go down and it raises the cyberspace protections in a robust way.  10.4 Crypto Exchanges  The blockchain reduces the predictable cybersecurity risk by removing the require- ment for human intermediates, due to this removing the threats which are related to corruption hacking, and human error. Some of the blockchain-based compa- nies are fairly centralized middlemen and some concerns are buying and sell- ing of blockchain-based currency by using their whole exchanging process in the blockchain methodology.  The Enigma is the developer of the catalyst claims that the MIT and Flybridge Cap- ital are their supporters. This is an off-chain-based decentralized exchange method and this method is working without the third-party clearing houses.  10.5 Cloud Storage  The cloud service providers are offering the cloud storage with the promise of secur- ing the users’ data in the centralized server, which by default increase the network vulnerability in the form of attacks from hackers. In blockchain, the cloud storage allows the data to be stored in a decentralized manner—this leads, in a less level, to different attack which causes the systematic damage and the data loss. Currently, the Amazon Web Services are providing the Simple Storage Service in the decentralized version with the help of “Filecoin” which is a high-proﬁle crypto-based project that is doing the ﬁle hosting in decentralized servers.  Some cloud service providing concerns have already started providing the blockchain-enabled cloud network storage to improve the security for the data and it reduces the transaction cost of storing information in the cloud.  11 Blockchain Visualization  The experts are arguing that the currency is one of the applications which can be constructed on the blockchain algorithm. In blockchain, linking nodes mechanism can be used to merge authentication layers in a sort of different network -based   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  253  applications, i.e., like Internet of Things [18]. On blockchain, there are different impressive ways available to visualize the Bitcoin transaction ﬂows. Some of those Bitcoin transaction ﬂow visualization tools are discussed below.  This is the ﬁrst Bitcoin visualization by Addy Yeow, which shows the distribution of the Bitcoin nodes across the world. It uses the crawler which is implemented in Python.  11.1 Bitnodes  11.2 Network Map  To add more impressive performance in the Bitcoin visualization, the “Network Map” was developed by the Addy Yeow. This Network Map includes all the Bitcoin nodes and the available node density. However, the structure of the network is not visible clearly in this one. Actually, it just suggests that there is a world evolving in the ﬁnance sector.  11.3 Daily Blockchain  The Daily Blockchain uses the Open-Source library called vivagraph.js demonstrates the Bitcoin’s networked nature. In this Daily Blockchain, the user can spot the Bitcoin transaction, occurrence in real-time and the growing hubs of the Bitcoin association.  The “Big Bang” is one of the blockchain visualizations designed by the Elliptic. The “Big Bang” is one of the most attractive visualizations of Bitcoin history at present.  11.4 Big Bang  11.5 Blockseer  The Blockseer is an illustration tool and moreover, it is one of the exploring tools that provide the innovative visualization of the Bitcoin cosmos. The user can visualize the Bitcoin transactions and blocks in a form of a detailed tree diagram.   254  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  12 How to Bring Blockchain as Lawful?  The French Data Protection Authority, members of the European Union Parliament, and the European Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum, are amongst the few legislative performers that have publicly recognized the anxieties between blockchain and the General Data Protection Regulations, in that the particular regulations are regarding the right to removal, right to reﬁnement and the principle of data minimization. The French Data Protection Authority has gone to the extent of recommending those resolutions such as the obliteration of private keys which would permit data subjects to get closer to an effective exercise of their right of erasure [19]. European Union Data Protection Board has issued procedures and recommen- dations to “ensure that blockchain technology is compliant with European Union Law” and this has been suggested by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs. In the year 2018, the efforts arose from International Organization of Securities Commissions, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Group of Twenty and Financial Stability Board, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the European Union Blockchain Partnership, launched by the European Union Commission. However, it may be years earlier than the blockchain users can see any real progress due to the conﬂicting approaches of regulators and governments around the world in this blockchain methodology.  The cash transactions can be scrutinized through banks, different ﬁnancial insti- tutions, transactions in privacy coins are further complicated to trace, due to the different cryptographic procedures such as zero acquaintance proofs and ring sig- natures, conceivably the majority of practical method to legalize the privacy coins is to permit them to be traded on regulated crypto exchanges. This could encour- age the coin trading under the surveillance and watchful eye of regulators which also create an initial auditable trail. Moreover, in 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission published guidelines on online platforms for trading digital assets, and ShapeShift reluctantly introduced Know-Your-Customer in the form of compulsory membership.  How will the courts and regulators distinguish the role of the code writer, deployer of the code, and platform operator who is unaware of the code? How will enforce- ment be pretentious by decentralized networks, anonymous code developers and unstoppable smart contracts? Still, many questions are raised during the adoption of the blockchain methodology into business. Still many countries like India have banned the cryptocurrencies, due to their countries’ regulation authorities who are not yet able to predict the standards and regulations and how to handle the issues if any cases arise due to the adoption of blockchain technology. Still, the globalization and international standards are needed to be prepared with the general guidelines, standards and directions and which should include how to handle the blockchain technology in a proper way.   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  255  13 Issues in Adopting Blockchain Technology  As coins have both sides, every technology was designed, created and introduced to overcome the existing issues. Unfortunately, designed and implemented technology might, by chance, have issues, and if those issues were not very serious, then it will be treated as limitations of that technology. In the same way, blockchain also contains some issues due to the difference in perspective.  14 Issues in Adopting Blockchain  Some of the issues of adopting the blockchain technology are highlighted and dis- cussed in this section, and the issues are discussed below.  14.1 What is the Role of the Law?  One of the foundation lawful issues is regarding jurisdiction and the relevant law in the blockchain technology. Nodes are spread over the world and the governing law of the contractual association may be tough to identify the users and their countries where the process has taken place. An additional problem is the enforceability of smart contracts, which are made by the blockchain technology which would be automatically executed on the occurrence of an incident [20].  A complete novel set of issues occurs with Decentralized Autonomous Organi- zations. These digital entities will be activated through the deployment of pre-coded rules and the use of smart contracts. They document their activity on the blockchain architecture model. Since the decentralization of organizations, what are their sta- tuses? When the Decentralized Autonomous Organization’s management is con- ducted mechanically, then who is responsible if there is a violation or breach of the law takes place? Who is going to claim against in the case of a legal dispute? What amount will be claimed  settled in such a case? These are some of the problems related to the legalities in the blockchain technology.  14.2 How can Blockchain Protect Intellectual Property  Rights?  How are the blockchain technologies going to protect the Intellectual Property rights when someone is processing the patent or copyright-related things? When a work is documented on the blockchain, then the inventor of that documented work can explain and prove the content of the work through their block’s hash value and the time of its   256  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  creation as proof of existence. Consequently, blockchain technology recommended a trustworthy evidence of that record which is processed in blockchain.  Though, the inventor may have to fulﬁll with the ofﬁcial procedure of the proper authority to hold their full package of rights despite the registration of the invention on the blockchain.  14.3 Who is Liable for the Blockchain?  Liability is one of the important lawful problems pertaining to the blockchain method- ology. Who is responsible when the system fails? Can Decentralized Autonomous Organizations be held accountable for the system fails? What law is applicable to determine liability and damages caused by the system fails in blockchain?  There are two types of blockchain available in its methodology: they are un- permissioned blockchain and permissioned blockchain. The former one is open to anybody, whereas the latter one will be maintained by a restricted collection of acti- vators which retains the power to right of entry, and to verify and insert transactions to the ledger. When compared, the permissioned blockchains are transparent than the un-permissioned blockchains and check if they are following the decentralized concept. They raise different types of issues. Despite their differences, both the per- missioned blockchain and un-permissioned blockchain ledgers operate in the same way.  15 Methods to Resolve the Issues  By introducing and including a governing law and jurisdiction clause for the blockchain technology this problem could be avoided. They operate as self-execution contracts, although they are not essentially a contract as legally deﬁned. Blockchain methodology offers several advantages for the invention, patent, and protection of Intellectual Property rights. It is speedy, economical and realistic. However, in prac- tice, such uses of the blockchain might oblige to reviewing the applicable legislation for the blockchain adoption in their country level, which is essential. Present leg- islations, standards, policies, and regulations are not inevitably ﬁt or ﬂexible to a blockchain ledger. In the present situation of interactions, the only possible and available means to assign the risk of liability are done by using the negotiations and contract.   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  257  16 Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Blockchain  When a technology is serving better in their specially designed sector and due to the enormous success in that sector, the other industrial ﬁelds start to examine those successes in technology like whether it is feasible to adopt into their sector and how to implement that technology into their sector. Blockchain and Artiﬁcial Intelligence are also included in this kind of scenario. This section is going to discuss the possibilities, adoption, and merging of the Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Blockchain technology.  17 How to Adopt Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Blockchain?  Contrasting Artiﬁcial Intelligence-related projects, the blockchain technology gener- ates decentralized and transparent networks that can be made accessible by everybody in and around the world. Whereas blockchain is the ledger that controls cryptocur- rencies, after that success in Bitcoin, the blockchain networks are at present ready to be applied into the different kinds of industries to create and maintain the decen- tralization [21, 22].  Presently, Hanson Robotics is prepared to apply “SingularityNET” to advance the intelligence of their humanoid robot which was named Sophia. Contrasting to Amazon’s Alexa, it will provide the answers to the questions which were raised by its user, and those answers were approved only by Amazon. But, Sophia will be talented to achieve with the help of other Artiﬁcial Intelligence suppliers for answers to questions. This shows that there is a much more ﬂexible solution and the Sophia will not be controlled by a central authority.  Furthermore, open marketplaces for public data will permit anyone who can set up a marketplace for any type of data. Users of the publically shared data will pay to access these sources with cryptocurrency paying method. The marketplaces constructed on Ocean Protocol will permit data to be accessed by all contestants, and also that ensuring there is no central player who can organize or exploit the data. The ultimate objective of this scheme is to decentralize entrance to data, and also guaranteeing those producing the narrow data sets is not possible.  Although the combination of blockchain and Artiﬁcial Intelligence is still budding, many industrial persons believe that the genuine challenge facing the implementation of decentralized Artiﬁcial Intelligence is getting people to understand about how their data are stored and how their data are processed in presently used methods.  18 Role of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Blockchain  When combining the two different technologies for a speciﬁc purpose, the results from that combination will be automatically improved and advanced. In the same   258  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  way, when combining the Artiﬁcial Intelligence into the blockchain, the following four parameters are improved by default [23].  Artiﬁcial Intelligence can perform collaborative learning without a centralized dataset. The processing speed needs to be performed faster than many users who can utilize the technology. The Artiﬁcial Intelligence can perform and provide better scalability when combined into the blockchain technology.  18.1 Scalability  18.2 Security  Artiﬁcial Intelligence can detect blockchain application layer intrusion issues. The intrusion is the major issue, of the network layer related thing. By using the Artiﬁcial Intelligence, the different kinds of attacks related to intrusion would be to ﬁgure out easily and also it can perform the defense system systematically. The Artiﬁcial Intelligence is a self-learning model, so from each and every attack, it will be able to learn and equip itself to defend it.  18.3 Privacy  Artiﬁcial Intelligence can improve the performance of hash functions. Privacy is important and trust point, which is used to increase the user’s level of conﬁdence as their data which were created, processed and stored in blockchain safe and secure. If the Artiﬁcial Intelligence merges into the blockchain, then the hash functions will be taken care of by Artiﬁcial Intelligence. By default, it will increase the privacy and conﬁdential level of the users.  18.4 Efﬁciency  Artiﬁcial Intelligence can predict the likelihood of a node to fulﬁll certain mining tasks. Blockchain’s transactions are needed to be authenticated by using the mining process. So, the Artiﬁcial Intelligence will increase the processing efﬁciencies in the blockchain’s transaction authentication mining tasks.   Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  259  19 Methods to Implement Artiﬁcial Intelligence  in Blockchain  The convergence of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in blockchain generates perhaps what the world’s majority consistent technology facilitated decision-making systems that are virtually tamper proof and present solid insights and decisions. Artiﬁcial Intelligence in blockchain can be implemented for any one of the following methods to improve its functions [24]:  cid:129  Improved business data models and globalized veriﬁcation systems  cid:129  Innovative audits and compliance systems  cid:129  Smarter ﬁnance and transparent governance  cid:129  Intelligent retail and intelligent predictive analysis  cid:129  Digital intellectual property rights  20 Existing Methods  To implement the Artiﬁcial Intelligence in blockchain, different methods are explained shortly with the help of different application using sectors in this section. The application using companies are classiﬁed through different platforms and they include Decentralized Intelligence, Prediction Platform, Conversational Platform, Prediction Platform, Intellectual Property, Data provenance, Trading, Insurance, and some Miscellaneous [25]. Figure 1 explains the blockchain methodology process in the cryptocurrency.  20.1 Decentralized Intelligence  Figure 2 shows the decentralized system.

Among them, the conﬁdentiality and integrity of data in cloud storage require improved security to avoid the data related threats. To improve the security level in cloud, the blockchain is incorporated into the cloud storage to maintain the conﬁdentiality and integrity of the data.  In the proposed methods the blockchain concept is incorporated into cloud stor- age to enhance the user data related things. The Artiﬁcial Intelligence is used in this proposed method to increase the complexity of hash value generation method. Figure 3 explains how the block is generated in the blockchain and how those blocks get validated. Figure 4 illustrates how the proposed method validates the newly cre- ated document or updated document by using the contributors within the blockchain group and also explains how the proposed method uses the Artiﬁcial Intelligence into blockchain technology. Figure 5 shows the ﬂowchart how the document is generated, validated and updated in the blockchain technology.  Fig. 3 Blockchain block making procedure   264  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  AI  Process  AI  Process  AI  Process  Fig. 4 Blockchain for cloud storage  21.1 The Designed Scenario  Once a document is created and shared with multiple users in cloud, then the par- ticipating user’s authentication is needed to be taken care of. If anyone of the user’s authentication credentials is compromised, then the whole document, which was shared among cloud users, may collapse or will meet threats relating to conﬁdential- ity, integrity, and availability. To avoid these kinds of unprofessional conducts, the blockchain concept was incorporated into the cloud storage. Once the user or admin created and shared a document with many users for further preparation or updating related purposes, and then each participating user will get rights to update that shared document. If a person updates the document and tries to validate the document, then the validation will be done by some other users who shared the document. If some of the users only validated that document, then the validated document will be stored in global data document versions. That document version will replace the actual global data document, only when all the users validate that document as valid. This will help the users to avoid the data security-related issues in cloud storage. The hash generation function with complex values helps to increase the processing power. Figure 6 explains the proposed methodology in step-by-step process.

If any invited user does not accept that invite, then that user will be declined and not added as a participating user to that shared document If anyone of the users made any update in shared document, then that document needs to be validated For the validation of the updated document, the document update information will be sent to all the participating users of that shared document While the document is waiting for the validation from other participating users, that updated document will be stored as temporary global data If some of the participating users validate that updated document, then that validated document will be stored as global data version The global data version document will be intimated to all the participating users   continued    Blockchain Technologies and Artiﬁcial Intelligence  267   continued   Step 10 When all the participating users validate that document, then the global data will be  Step 11  replaced by the global data version Once the global data are replaced by the global data version, then the global data replaced information will be intimated to all the participating users Check whether any participating user tries to modify the data  Step 12 Step 13 When no one tries to modify the data then wait until the modiﬁcation occurs Step 14  if any participating user tries to modify the document, then the process will again start from Steps 5–13 If any participating user needs to prepare a new document and share that document, then the process will again start from Steps 2–13 Stop the process  Step 15  Step 16  21.3 Discussions  The proposed model of incorporating the blockchain into cloud storage will improve the security level to the data in cloud. Already, the blockchain was incorporated in the Internet of Things  IoT , Financial Sectors, healthcare Sectors, and Cryptocurrency Sectors, i.e., Bitcoin. But, in cloud computing, the adaption of blockchain will vary according to the purpose of incorporating.  Some of the cloud concerns have already started to work on the blockchain adop- tion to increase the security level and those changes will take place in the industry very soon. In this paper, incorporating blockchain into cloud storage model is illustrated and explained to improve the data conﬁdentiality and integrity.  If the proposed model is implemented with hash value function, validating pre- vious hash value function and timestamp for document tamper proof, then it will reduce the data security issues and also it will increase the users’ trust on their cloud service providers. These things will be taken care of by the Artiﬁcial Intelligence. The above-explained procedure of creating and validating the document does not cover the Artiﬁcial Intelligence hash value creation.  22 Future Research Directions of Blockchain Technologies  Using Artiﬁcial Intelligence  The proposed methodology is explained with the document ﬁle, in the same way as the proposed methodology can be adopted into any other document type ﬁles, media ﬁles, or audio ﬁles. Whenever a ﬁle is created, added or modiﬁed, then those concepts will be shown as partially veriﬁed when only a few of the participants are veriﬁed. When the ﬁle is created, added or modiﬁed, the ﬁle will be veriﬁed by all the participants of the group then only the one modiﬁed will replace the existing ﬁle. This will increase the trust, conﬁdentiality, and integrity of the service provided within the group.  When blockchain creates the trust and avoids the third-party veriﬁcations, then including the Artiﬁcial Intelligence into the blockchain will increase the processing   268  S. Muthukrishnan and B. Duraisamy  power, creating complex hash values, and increasing the security. Overall, the existing methods are serving in different industrial applications and proposed method will increase the security of the documents with the help of partial veriﬁcation method and all the participants’ veriﬁcation method. The same can be used for the other sectors too.  References  1. https:  en.oxforddictionaries.com deﬁnition blockchain.

It also allows providing the distributed ledger technology for handling data. By exercising this chapter, one can create the own methodology for blockchain without hopping onto preexisting knowledge on it. This chapter also provides the underpinnings and practical aspects of blockchain implementation on platforms like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.  Keywords Hyperledger Fabric· Transaction mining· Ethereum· ASIC miner· Hash algorithm· Genesis block  1 Introduction  Ledger is a database shared across multiple sites and institutions. A distributed ledger is stored and updated independently by the entire user  node  in a large network. Records are not communicated to user  node  by a central authority, but indepen- dently by every node. The entire node on the network processes every transaction individually, coming to conclusions and then consensus  voting  on the conclusions to make the majority agree with the conclusions [1].  R.

Initiation of a   transaction by the   user  Transactions wait in the pool  of unconfirmedtransactions  to be picked by miners  Miners form blocks   from these transactions  The miner who finds a  legitimate solution to the  problem broadcasts the  block to the blockchain  To add the block to the   blockchain, miners need to   solve a complex mathematical   problem  Fig. 1 Process of mining  2 Key Features for Hyperledger Fabric  The smart are generally written using programming languages such as Java, Golang, and NodeJS JavaScript [2]. Smart Contracts are computerized transaction that exe- cutes the terms of a contract in the occurrence of particular event such as:   i  Update the account balance after ensuring that there are enough in the account  to do a debit transaction.   ii  Decide the shipping price of an item depending on the day of delivery.  The fabric is permissioned which means that only the invited people can participate and view the blockchain. One does not need cryptocurrency for mining of the blocks.  3 What is Mining?  Process of adding transaction records to public ledger is termed as mining where miners need to solve a mathematical problem based over cryptography hash algo- rithm. The solution found is called as Proof of Work  PoW . This proof proves that the miner did spend a lot of time and resources on mining. The Blockchain transac- tions could be viewed as complicated mathematical puzzles [3] which follow certain deﬁned sequence termed as hashing algorithm. Each cryptocurrency has its own unique hashing algorithm as shown in Fig. 1. For instance, bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm, Monero uses CryptoNight, and Ethereum uses Ethash.  4 Hash Algorithms  Miners are required to consistently guess the value that satisﬁes them. Being a very complicated task for humans  as it is very complex  the devices which are capable of handling that complexity are assigned the same which includes Personal Computers   Blockchain Hands on for Developing Genesis Block  271  and specialized mining types of equipment such as Application-Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits  ASIC  which is simply an integrated circuit specially designed so as to perform a single function in fast, and efﬁcient manner. Hash rate of an average ASIC miner is far above than that of a high-end PC or Graphics processing unit  GPU . Hash rate, being directly proportional to the speed of particular miner to solve the puzzles and ultimately win a fair share of coins in turn [4].  5 Need for Application-Speciﬁc Integrated Circuit  ASIC ?  In 2009, the standard PC was sufﬁcient to solve the task to mine the Bitcoin. But ahead on the timeline, Graphics Processing Units  GPUs  got discovered by people which were far better as they had much better hash rates—being more than 10× [5]. Now from GPUs, the crypto mining sphere ﬂowned to Field-Programmable Gate Array  FPGA  processors which were equipped with the ability to get connected to an average PC and commit the task just ﬁnely. Actually, in fact exceeded than gaming GPUs. ASICs were also able to perform ﬁner or better. At current times Cryptocurrency mining couldn’t be talked without noting the Blockchain aspect into it [6]. It contains the following reasons:  1. The Hash rate of an average ASIC miner is far higher than that of a high-end PC or GPU. The greater the hash rate, the quicker it is for the miner to solve the puzzles and grab a fair share of coins ultimately.  2. Efﬁciency is there. One should remember the fact that ASIC miner is solely dedicated to solving mathematically advanced puzzles which guarantee coins to the owner. The whole architecture is tailored to be geared toward this one intent. This ultra-focus has far better outcomes compared to, say, as a PC that is purposeful or dedicated to running different processes simultaneously.  A major drawback of using Application-Speciﬁc integrated circuits is the worth of electricity that turns in as mining rigs engross a lot of electrical energy, That could acutely cut down the proﬁt margins and affecting factor is that it would have to operate non-stop and should consider at pennies especially when there is small-scale miner [7].  6 Hyperledger Fabric—Build Network First  The following commands have been tried and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. For a Windows or a Mac user, one needs to install Curl, Docker, Docker-compose, Go, Node and NPM, Python on his her own.  Now open the terminal and type the following commands into the terminal  windows:  sudo apt-get install curl   272  R. S. Bhadoria et al.  sudo apt-get install golang-go export GOPATH=$HOME go export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH bin sudo apt-get install nodejs sudo apt-get install npm sudo apt-get install python sudo apt-get install docker curl -fsSL https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu gpg  sudo apt-key add - sudo add-apt-repository “deb [arch = amd64] https:  download.docker.com linux ubuntu $ lsb_release -cs  stable” sudo apt-get update apt-cache policy docker-ce sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce sudo apt-get install docker-compose sudo apt-get upgrade  Enviroment is supposed to be ready if all above commands execute without errors  [8].  No one can download some samples of Fabric that have already been prepared by  entering the following commands into the terminal:  sudo curl -sSL 0https:  goo.gl 6wtTN5  sudo bash -s 1.1.0 sudochmod 777 -R fabric-samples  Congratulations!! Now one is all set to run his her ﬁrst network. Change to the ﬁrst-network directory by “cd” command and run the generate script. The generated script will create the certiﬁcates and keys for the entities that are going to exist on his her blockchain. It will also create the Genesis block.  7 What is Genesis Block?  The ﬁrst block of the blockchain is called as Genesis block which is the common predecessor of rest of the blocks in blockchain, i.e. Following the blockchain starting from any node backwards we will be reaching the genesis block in due course at the end [9]. A blockchain of at least one block is at the origin of each node always because of the reason that within the bitcoin client software the genesis block is statically encoded, such that it cannot be altered [10].  cd fabric-samples ﬁrst-network sudo . byfn.sh generate  cid:129  Now bring the blockchain network up by entering the following command into your terminal. sudo . byfn.sh up   Blockchain Hands on for Developing Genesis Block  273   cid:129  If the command executed successfully without any error then congratulations one has created his her ﬁrst fabric network. Bring down the network by the following command. sudo . byfn.sh down  – Help text for the byfn  build-your-ﬁrst-network  script is given here-  byfn.sh   [-c  ] [-t  ] [-d  ] [-f <docker-  compose-ﬁle>] [-s  ] [-l  ] [-i  ] [-v]   -oneof ‘up’, ‘down’, ‘restart’, ‘generate’ or ‘upgrade’  – ‘up’—bring up the network with docker-compose up – ‘down’—clear the network with docker-compose down – ‘restart’—restart the network – ‘generate’—generate required certiﬁcates and genesis block – ‘upgrade’—upgrade the network from v1.0.x to v1.1  – c  —channel name to use  defaults to “mychannel”  – t  —CLI time out duration in seconds  defaults to 10  – d  —delay duration in seconds  defaults to 3  – f  —specify which docker-compose ﬁle use  defaults to  docker-compose-cli.yaml   – s  —the database backend to use: goleveldb  default  or couchdb – l  —the chain code language: golang  default , node or java – i  —the tag to be used to launch the network  defaults to “latest”  – v—verbose mode  byfn.sh-h  print this message    cid:129  Usually, required certiﬁcates & genesis block are generated prior of bringing up of the networks. For example: byfn.shgenerate-cmychannel byfn.shup-cmychannel-scouchdb byfn.shup-cmychannel-scouchdb-i1.1.0-alpha byfn.shup-lnode byfn.shdown-cmychannel byfn.shupgrade-cmychannel  cid:129  Taking all defaults: byfn.shgenerate byfn.shup byfn.shdown  cid:129  If the channel name is not provided, the script will use a default name of “mychannel”.   274  8 Ethereum  R. S. Bhadoria et al.  In today’s world personal data of a user such as his her account’s password, transac- tion details are stored on servers of companies such as Amazon, Google, or Facebook. A hacker may gain access to these ﬁles as it is a third party app and he she may steal the user’s information or change it without the user’s knowledge. Brian Behlendorf, creator of the Apache Web Server, labeled this as the “original sin” of Internet. Ethereum is the solution to this issue [11].  Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network-based open software plat- form which enables developers to set up decentralized applications and build them. Utilization of Ethereum enabled the substitutes of many servers by “nodes” run by volunteers over the globe; establishing a “world computer” [12]  The focus of Ethereum blockchain is on running the programming code of any of the decentralized application. In Ethereum blockchains, rather than mining for bitcoin, miners endeavour to earn Ether, which is a type of crypto token which fuels the network. At or to the further side of a cryptocurrency that could be traded, application developers also use Ether for paying transaction charges & services on Ethereum networks. Also, Token which is being used for paying miners’ charges for including the transactions in their block, also termed as gas is another kind of token and execution of all wise or smart contracts requires sending some quantity of gas with it so as to induce or attract miners for putting it in the Blockchain [13].  Because of ’ERC20 token standard’ deﬁned by the Ethereum Foundation, own versions of this token can be issued by other developers and funds can be raised with an Initial Coin Offering  ICO . In this fundraising strategy, the amount is set by the issuers of the token, it wants to raise, then offered in a crowd sale, and Ether in exchange is received. By ICOs Billions of dollars have been raised on the Ethereum platform in the past few years. EOS is an ERC20 token [14]  9 Advantages of using Ethereum Platform  cid:129  Security—It’s having no failure central point & use of cryptography enhancing security provides protection for application security against hacking and malicious fraudulent attempts or activities.  cid:129  Immutability—Any third party will be unable to alter the data or simply it will not be capable of or susceptible to altered.  cid:129  Corruption and tamper-proof—A network formed around the principle of consen- sus on which Apps are based on which in turn makes the censorship impossible.  cid:129  No downtime—Applications can never be switched off and never go down.  Regardless of being accompanied by number of advantages, decentralized appli- cations are not ﬂawless, since wise and smart contract code is coded by humans, the smart contracts are just roundabout that good that a coder who coded it. Cod- ing errors or bugs left unchecked, oversighted or just any miscalculation leads to   Blockchain Hands on for Developing Genesis Block  275  unforeseen and unplanned adverse actions being taken. If a bug or coding oversight gets exploited, no efﬁcient way can withstand any attack or exploitation other than obtaining a network consensus and recoding the underlying code after getting the bug or ﬂaw traced.  Which could be seen as violating one of the main spirits of the blockchains which  is supposed to be unalterable.  Also, actions taken by a central party upraises serious questions and debatable  doubts about the decentralized nature of an application [15].  10 Installation of Ethereum on Ubuntu  The following steps need to be executed while installation is done:  cid:129  Start by cloning the git repository git clone https:  github.com ethereum go-ethereum  cid:129  Now change the directory using “cd” command and change to go-ethereum folder cd go-ethereum   cid:129  Now check for the versions available using the command- git tag  cid:129  Create the branch of the latest version using the command git checkout tags xxxx –b yyyy  xxxx—latest version yyyy—target destination  Next step is to install the golang as part of the system. One can simply go to https:  golang.org dl  and download the package for the Ubuntu machine. Now next step is to extract and install it on the system.  cid:129  For extraction and installation follow the commands- sudo tar –xvfxxxxx xxxx—ﬁle name to be extracted  cid:129  Next step is to add the environment variables to the list of variables. This can be done by the command- sudogedit .bashrc  cid:129  Adding three lines to it export GOROOT= $HOME go export GOPATH=$HOME Projects Proj1 export PATH=$GOPATH bin:$GOROOT bin:$PATH  cid:129  Now one can save the .bashrc and close it. Now execute the command- make all  In the old terminal window in which the branch was created. Now next step is to  create the genesis block, i.e., the ﬁrst block.   276  R. S. Bhadoria et al.   cid:129  Open a new terminal window and type the following commands— cd go-ethereum  mkdir genesis cd genesis gedit genesis1.json  cid:129  Now add the following to the details of the genesis block— {          “nonce”:    “0x3”,          “timestamp”:      “0x0”,          “parentHash”:     “0x00000000000000000000000000000000000”,          “extraData”:    “0x0”,          “gasLimit”:     “0x4c4b40”,          “difficulty”:   “0x500”,          “mixhash”:      “0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000”,         “coinbase:   “0x000000000000000000”,  }  The above blocks have been explained with the following functionality:  cid:129  extraData: It is the extra 32  or 64 bit  that can be used to pass a message.  cid:129  difﬁculty: it tells how difﬁcult it is going to mine a speciﬁc block.  cid:129  coinbase: it is the address to which the coins have to be sent after mining.  cid:129  parentHash: Address of the antecedent block in that blockchain.  cid:129  nonce: It is the value that needs to be computed by each miner.  cid:129  mixhash: It is the value which remains ﬁxed throughout the chain.  cid:129  gaslimit: It is the resource limit which you can spend while mining a block.  The combination of nonce and mixhash is what we called as Proof-of-Work  PoW . One needs to get a speciﬁc hash value which is less than the set value. So basically one needs to get the value of the nonce and add it to the mixhash, the hash obtained should be less than the hash value which has been set.  cid:129  Finally the blockchain can be initiated— –  home  username  go-ethereum build bin geth –datadir ~ethereum net3   –  home  username  go-ethereum build bin geth –datadir ~ethereum net3 –  init genesis genesis1.json  networkid 3 console  The different steps of installations can be done using Golang environment and one can use the following commands to create different blocks as shown in Fig. 2 by adopting the below mentioned methods:  cid:129  personal.newAccount  : Creates a new account on the blockchain which has a speciﬁc wallet attached to it.  cid:129  eth.accounts  : Displays the accounts that are part of the blockchain.  cid:129  eth.blockNumber  : Tells the current block number.  cid:129  miner.start  : To start the block mining.

This provides the generic platform for many kinds of appli- cations like e-governance, agriculture, real estate, and many more. The permission less mode of operation carried into Ethereum creates a lot of issues associated with the creation of contract. The Hyperledger Fabric solves the performance and privacy issues by permissioned mode of operation. It follows the several mining algorithms and ﬁne-grained access control. Fabric customization to a multitude of applications is granted by the modular architecture.   278  References  R. S. Bhadoria et al.  1.
