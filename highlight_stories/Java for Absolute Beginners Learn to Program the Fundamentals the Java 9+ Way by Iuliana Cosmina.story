He has authored a half-dozen Android book titles  for Apress, including four titles in the popular Pro Android series. Wallace received his  undergraduate degree in business economics from the University of California at Los  Angeles and a graduate degree in MIS design and implementation from the University of  Southern California. He is currently the CEO of Mind Taffy Design, a new media content  production and digital campaign design and development agency.  xv   Acknowledgments  Here I am again, the main author of a technical book for the third time.  This book was quite challenging to write, because I had to quickly adapt to changes  made to the Java ecosystem. With the new six months interval release system, modules  being introduced, and backward compatibility thrown out the window, I found myself  with a project that stopped compiling and had to invest precious time into fixing it,  understand why it broke in the first place, and eventually adapt the book.  Writing books for beginners is tricky, because as an experienced developer, it might   be difficult to find the right examples and explain them in such a way that even a non-  technical person would easily understand them. That is why I am profoundly grateful to  Matthew Moodie and Mark Powers for all the support and advice they provided to keep  this book at beginner level. We have been working together for four years and it has been  a fruitful collaboration so far.  I would like to thank Wallace Jackson; his recommendations and corrections were   crucial for the final form of the book.  Apress has published many of the books that I have read and used to improve myself  professionally. It is a great honor to publish my fourth book with Apress, and it gives me  enormous satisfaction to be able to contribute to the “making” of a new generation of  Java developers.  I am grateful to all my friends who had the patience to listen to me complain about   sleepless nights and writer’s block. Thank you all for being supportive and making sure I  still had some fun while writing this book. You have no idea how dear you are to me.  I am thankful to John Mayer still, as his music provided yet again, a great   environment for my working nights.  A special thank you to Achim Wagner, whom I consider both a mentor and a dear   friend. He provided me with an environment and support to grow as a professional and  as a person, and I will miss working with him.  xvii   aCknowledgmenTs  A special thank you to the Bogza-Vlad family: Monica, Tinel, Cristina, and Stefan.   You are all close to my heart and this book might have been released later without your  support when I moved to Edinburgh.  And a very special thank-you in advance to all the passionate Java developers who   will find mistakes in the book and be so kind to write me about them so I can provide an  erratum and make this book even better.  xviii   Introduction  Even though I have been writing Java Applications since 2002 I don’t think I’ve ever dived  so deeply into the JVM as I did while writing this book. Most companies I’ve worked  for had their own code base when I joined them, and my work was mostly related to  designing, improving or maintaining one that already existed. It’s like making brownies  when you already have brownie mix. Writing this book has given me the opportunity to  get down to basics and work with basic ingredients—so, making brownies using eggs,  flower, cocoa, milk, and butter.  Java began in 1982 and was created by a handful of people. The most renowned   name linked to the beginning of Java is James Gosling, also known as the father of  Java, the language that is now used on over three billion devices. When Oracle bought  Sun Microsystems, developers were worried about Java’s future, especially since its  main creator quit the company and went on to create what was thought to be Java’s  replacement: Scala. That will probably never happen. Java is still here.  Most banking applications are written in Java and because it is definitely dangerous   and costly to migrate these applications, Java will be here in 50 years, if not more. Java  began by making websites more dynamic and more entertaining, and ended up being  the basis for applications run on ATMs, cashier machines, computers, and mobile  devices. Sure, this would have been more difficult if Java wasn’t cross-platform.  The first Java version was officially released in 1996. Since then, ten more versions   have been released, with the latest one, Java 11, being released on 25th September 2018.  The work on Java 12 has already begun and the early access build is already available.  This book was written with the intention to cover the fundamental elements of the   language and of the JVM, especially the ones introduced in versions 9, 10, and 11.   The book provides a complete overview of the most important Java classes in the JVM,   all wrapped up in a multimodule project that compiles with Java 11 and Gradle 5.    xix   InTroduCTIon  A group of reviewers has gone over the book, but if you notice any inconsistencies,  please send an email to editorial@apress.com, or directly to the author, and corrections  will be made and published in an erratum that will be uploaded to the official GitHub  repository for the book. The example source code for this book can be found on GitHub  or downloaded from the official book’s product page, located at www.apress.com in  book 9781484237779.  I truly hope you will enjoy using this book to learn Java as much as I enjoyed writing it.  xx   CHAPTER 1  An Introduction to Java  and Its History  Java is currently one of the most influential programming languages. It all started in  1990, when an American company that was leading the revolution in the computer  industry decided to gather its best engineers together to design and develop a product  that would allow them to become an important player in the new emerging Internet  world. Among those engineers was James Arthur Gosling, a Canadian computer scientist  who is recognized as the “father” of the Java programming language. It would take five  years of design, programming, and one rename  from Oak to Java because of trademark  issues , but finally in 1996, Java 1.0 was released for Linux, Solaris, Mac, and Windows. You might have the tendency to skip this chapter altogether. But I think it would be   a mistake. I was never much interested in the history of Java. I was using it for work. I  knew that James Gosling was the creator and that Oracle bought Sun, and that was pretty  much it. I never cared much about how the language evolved, where the inspiration  came from, or how one version was different from another. I started learning Java at  version 1.5, and I took a lot of things in the language for granted. So, when I was assigned  to a project running on Java 1.4, I was quite confused, because I did not know why  some of the code I wrote was not compiling. Although the IT industry is moving very  fast, there will always be that one client that has a legacy application. And knowing the  peculiarities of each Java version is an advantage, because you know the issues when  performing a migration.  When I started doing research for this book, I was mesmerized. The history of Java is   interesting because it is a tale of incredible growth, success of a technology, and how a  clash of egos in management almost killed the company that created it. Because even if  Java is the most used technology in software development, it is simply paradoxical that  the company that gave birth to it no longer exists.    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_1  1   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  This chapter covers each version of Java to track the evolution of the language and   the Java virtual machine. You can find a timeline for versions 1.0 to 1.8 on the Oracle  official site at http:  oracle.com edgesuite.net timeline java. . But first, I’ll  introduce the book.   Who This Book Is For Most Java books for beginners start with the typical Hello World! example depicted here:  public class HelloWorld {     public static void main String[] args  {         System.out.println "Hello  World!" ;     } }  This code, when executed, prints Hello World! in the console. But if you have bought  this book, it is assumed that you want to develop real applications in Java, and get a real  chance when applying for a position as a Java developer. If this is what you want, if this  is who you are, a beginner with the wits and the desire to make full use of this language’s  power, then this book is for you. And that is why to start this book, a complex example is  used. We go over it in almost every section, when some part of it is clarified.  Java is a language with a syntax that is readable and based on the English language.   So, if you have a logical thinking and a little knowledge of the English language, it should  be obvious to you what the following code does without even executing it.    public static void main String[] args  {     List  items = List.of "1", "a", "2", "a", "3", "a" ;  package com.apress.ch.one.hw;  import java.util.List;  public class Example01 {      items.forEach item -> {         if  item.equals "a"   {               System.out.println "A" ;         } else {  2   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory               System.out.println "Not A" ;         }     } ;   } }  In this code example, a list of text values is declared; then the list is traversed, and when   a text is equal to "a", the letter "A" is printed in the console; otherwise, "Not A" is printed.  If you are an absolute beginner to programming, this book is for you, especially   because the sources attached to this book make use of algorithms and design patterns  commonly used in programming. So, if your plan is to get into programming and learn  a high-level programming language, read the book, run the examples, write your own  code, and you should have a good head start.  If you already know Java, you can use this book too because it covers the specifics of   Java versions 9, 10, and 11  the EAP1 release .  How This Book Is Structured The chapter you are reading is an introductory one that covers a little bit of Java history,  showing you how the language has evolved and a glimpse into its future. Also, the mechanics  of executing a Java application are covered, so that you are prepared for Chapter 2. The  next chapter shows you how to set up a development environment and introduces you  to a simple application. In Chapters 3 to 7, the fundamental parts of the language are  covered: packages, modules, classes, objects, operators, data types, statements, streams,  lambda expressions, and so forth. Starting with Chapter 8 more advanced features are  covered such as: interactions with external data sources: reading writing files, serializing  deserializing objects, testing and creating an interface. Chapter 12 is dedicated fully to the  publish-subscribe framework introduced in Java 9. Chapter 13 covers the garbage collector.  The book is completed by the java-for-absolute-beginners project. This project is  organized in modules  thus it is a multimodule project  that are linked to each other and  must be managed by Gradle. Gradle is something we developers call a build tool, which  is used to build projects. To build a project means transforming the code into something  that can be executed. I chose to use multimodule projects for the books I write because  it is easier to build them, and common elements can be grouped together, keeping the   1 Early Access Program  3   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  configuration of the project simple and non-repetitive. Also, by having all the sources  organized in one multimodule project, you get the feedback on whether the sources are  working or not as soon as possible, and you can contact the author and ask him or her to  update them.   Conventions This book uses a number of formatting conventions that should make it easier to read. To  that end, the following conventions are used within the book:      code or concept names in paragraphs appear as follows:  import java.util.List;      code listings appear as follows:  public static void main String[] args  {         System.out.println "Hello there young developer!" ; }      logs in console outputs appear as follows:  01:24:07.809 [main] INFO  c.a.Application - Starting Application 01:24:07.814 [main] DEBUG c.a.p.c.Application - Running in debug mode ...          ! This symbol appears in front of paragraphs that you should pay  specific attention to.  Italic font is used for metaphors, jocular terms and technical terms that  the reader should pay special attention to because they are not explained  in the current context, but they are covered in the book. Examples:  “This was mentioned before at the end of Chapter 4 when generics were  introduced.” “The stack memory is used during execution  also referred  to as at runtime ” or “Let’s see how this is being done under the hood”.     Bold font is used for chapter references and important terms.  As for my style of writing, I like to write my books in the same way I have technical   conversations with colleagues and friends: sprinkling jokes, giving production examples,  and making analogies to non-programming situations. Because programming is just  another way to model the real world.  4   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory   When Java Was Owned by Sun Microsystems The first version of Java was released in 1996. Up until that point, there was a small  team named the Green Team that worked on a prototype language named Oak, which  was introduced to the world with a working demo—an interactive handheld home  entertainment controller called the Star7. The star of the animated touch-screen user  interface was a cartoon character named Duke, created by one of the team’s graphic  artists, Joe Palrang. Over the years, Duke has become the official Java technology mascot,  and every JavaOne conference has its own Duke mascot personality and the most simple  version is depicted in Figure 1-1.  Figure 1-1.  The Duke mascot  image source: http:  oracle.com    The Green Team released it to the world via the Internet, because that was the fastest   way to create widespread adoptions. You can imagine that they jumped for joy every  time somebody downloaded it, because it meant people were interested in it. And there   are a few other advantages making software open source, like the fact that contributions  and feedback come from a bigger and diverse number of people from all over the world.  Thus, for Java, this was the best decision, as it shaped the language a lot of developers  are using today. Even after 22 years, Java is still among the top-three most used  programming languages.  5   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  The American company that started all of this was Sun Microsystems, founded in   1982. It guided the computer revolution by selling computers, computer parts, and  software. Among their greatest achievements is the Java programming language. In  Figure 1-2,2 you can see the company logo that was used since Java’s birth year until it  was acquired by Oracle in 2010.  Figure 1-2.  The Sun Microsystems logo  image source: https:  en.wikipedia. org wiki Sun_Microsystems   It is quite difficult to find information about the first version of Java, but dedicated  developers that witnessed the birth of Java—when the web was way smaller and full of  static pages—did create blogs and shared their experience with the world. It was quite  easy for Java to shine with its applets that displayed dynamic content and interacted  with the user. But because the development team thought bigger, Java became much  more than a web programming language. Because in trying to make applets run in any  browser, the team found a solution to a common problem: portability.  Nowadays, developers face a lot of headaches when developing software that  should run on any operating system. And with the mobile revolution, things have  become really tricky. In Figure 1-3, you see an abstract drawing of what is believed to  be the first Java logo.  2 The story behind the logo can be read here: https:  goodlogo.com extended.info sun- microsystems-logo-2385. You can also read more about Sun Microsystems.  6   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  Figure 1-3.  The first Java logo, 1996–2003  image source: http:  xahlee.info      Java 1.0 was released at the first JavaOne conference—with over 6000 attendees. It  started out as a language named Oak3 that was really similar to C++ and was designed  for handheld devices and set-top boxes. It evolved into the first version of Java, which  provided developers some advantages that C++ did not.      security: In Java, there is no danger of reading bogus data when  accidentally going over the size of an array.     automatic memory management: A Java developer does not have   to check if there is enough memory to allocate for an object and then  deallocate it explicitly; the operations are automatically handled by the  garbage collector. This also means that pointers are not necessary.          simplicity: There are no pointers, unions, templates, structures.  Mostly anything in Java can be declared as a class. Also, confusion  when using multiple inheritance is avoided by modifying the  inheritance model and not allowing multiple class inheritance.  support for multithreaded execution: Java was designed from the  start to support development of multithreaded software.     portability: A Java motto is Write it once, run it everywhere. This is   made possible by the Java virtual machine, which is covered shortly.  3 The language was named by James Gosling after the oak tree in front of his house.  7   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  All this made Java appealing for developers, and by 1997, when Java 1.1 was released,   there were already approximatively 400,000 Java developers in the world. JavaOne had  10,000 attendees that year. The path to greatness was set. Before going further in our  analysis of each Java version, let’s clarify a few things.   Why Is Java Portable? I mentioned a few times that Java is portable and that Java programs can run on any  operating system. It is time to explain how this is possible. Let’s start with a simple  drawing, like the one in Figure 1-4.  Figure 1-4.  What makes Java portable  Java is what we call a high-level programming language that allows a developer  to write programs that are independent of a particular type of computer. High-level  languages are easier to read, write, and maintain. But their code must be translated by  a compiler or interpreted into machine language  unreadable by humans because is it  made up of numbers  to be executed, because that is the only language that computers  understand.  8   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  In Figure 1-4, notice that on top of the operating systems, a JVM is needed to execute   a Java program. JVM stands for Java virtual machine, which is an abstract computing  machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It is a platform-independent  execution environment that converts Java code into machine language and executes it. So, what is the difference between Java and other high-level languages? Well, other  high-level languages compile source code directly into machine code that is designed  to run on a specific microprocessor architecture or operating system, such as Windows  or UNIX. What JVM does, it that is mimics a Java processor making it possible for a Java  program to be interpreted as a sequence of actions or operating system calls on any  processor regardless of the operating system.  And because the Java compiler was mentioned, we have to get back to Java 1.1,   which was widely used, even as new versions were released. It came with an improved  Abstract Window Toolkit  AWT  graphical API  collections of components used for  building applets , inner classes, database connectivity classes  JDBC model , classes for  remote calls  RMI , a special compiler for Microsoft platforms named JIT,4 support for  internationalization, and Unicode. Also, what made it so widely embraced is that shortly  after Java was released, Microsoft licensed it and started creating applications using it.  The feedback helped further development of Java, thus Java 1.1 was supported on all  browsers of the time, which is why it was so widely deployed.  !  a lot of terms used in the introduction of the book might seem foreign to you  now, but as you read the book, more information is presented and these words  will start to make more sense. For now, just keep in mind, that every new Java  version, has something more than the previous version, and at that time, every  new component is a novelty.  So, what exactly happens to developer-written Java code until the actual execution?   The process is depicted in Figure 1-5.  4 Just In Time  9   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  Figure 1-5.  From Java code to machine code  In Figure 1-5, you see that Java code is compiled and transformed to bytecode that is  then interpreted and executed by the Java virtual machine on the underlying operating  system. This is what Java is: a compiled and interpreted general-purpose programming  language with a large number of features that make it well suited for the web. And now  that we’ve covered how Java code is executed, let’s go back to some more history.   Sun Microsystem’s Java Versions The first stable Java version released by Sun Microsystems could be downloaded from the  website as an archive named JDK 1.0.2. JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. This is  the software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets.  It includes the Java Runtime Environment  JRE , an interpreter  loader , a compiler, an  archiver, a documentation generator, and other tools needed for Java development. We will  get into this more when I cover how to install the JDK on your computer.  10   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  Starting with version 1.2, released in 1998, Java versions were given codenames.5   The Java version 1.2 codename was Playground. It was a massive release and this was  the moment when people started talking about the Java 2 Platform. Starting with this  version, the releases up to J2SE 5.0 were renamed, and J2SE replaced JDK because the  Java platform was now composed of three parts:              J2SE  Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition , which later became JSE, a  computing platform for the development and deployment of portable  code for desktop and server environments  J2EE  Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition , which later became  JEE, a set of specifications extending Java SE with specifications for  enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services  J2ME  Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition , which later became JME, a  computing platform for development and deployment of portable  code for embedded and mobile devices  With this release, the JIT compiler became part of Sun Microsystem’s JVM  which  basically means turning code into executable code became a faster operation and the  generated executable code was optimized , the Swing graphical API was introduced as  a fancy alternative to AWT  new components to create fancy desktop applications were  introduced , and the Java collections framework  for working with sets of data  was  introduced.  J2SE 1.3 was released in 2000 with the codename Kestrel  maybe as a reference to  the newly introduced Java sound classes . This release also contained Java XML APIs.  J2SE 1.4 was released in 2002 with the codename Merlin. This is the first year that the  Java Community Process members were involved in deciding which features the release  should contain, and thus, the release was quite consistent. This is the first release of the  Java platform developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 59.6 The following  features are among those worth mentioning.     Support for IPv6  basically applications that run over a network can   now be written to work using networking protocol IPv6 .  5 All codenames, for intermediary releases too, are listed here: http:  www.oracle.com  technetwork java javase codenames-136090.htmlclose 6 If you want to see the contents and the list of Java Specification Requests, follow this URL:  http:  www.jcp.org en jsr detail?id=59  11   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory     Non-blocking IO  IO is an acronym for input-output, which refers to   reading and writing data— a very slow operation. Making IO non-  blocking means to optimize these operations to increase speed of the  running application.      Logging API  Operations that get executed need to be reported to a  file or a resource, which can be read in case of failure to determine  the cause and find a solution. This process is called logging and  apparently only in this version components to support this operation  were introduced.       Image processing API  Components developers can use this to  manipulate images with Java code.   Java’s coffee cup logo made its entrance in 2003  between releases 1.4 and 5.0  at the   JavaOne conference. You can see it in Figure 1-6.7  Figure 1-6.  Java official logo 2003-2006  image source: http:  oracle.com   J2SE 5.0 was released in 2004 with the codename Tiger. Initially, it followed the  typical versioning, and was named 1.5, but because this was a major release with a  significant number of new features that proved a serious improvement of maturity,  stability, scalability, and security of the J2SE, the version was labeled 5.0 and presented  like that to the public, even if internally 1.5 was still used. For this version and the next  two, it was considered that 1.x = x.0. Let’s list those features because most of them are  covered in the book.  7 The Java language was first named Oak. It was renamed to Java because of copyright issues.  There are a few theories that you will find regarding the new name. There is one saying that  the JAVA name is actually a collection of the initials of the names being part of the Green team:  James Gosling, Arthur Van Hoff, and Andy Bechtolsheim, and that the logo is inspired by their  love of coffee.  12   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory     Generics provide compile-time  static  type safety for collections and  eliminates the need for most type conversions  which means the type  used in a certain context is decided while the application is running,  we have a full section about this in Chapter 5 .     Annotations, also known as metadata, are used to tag classes and  methods to allow metadata-aware utilities to process them  which  means a component is labeled as something another component  recognizes and does specific operations with it .     Autoboxing unboxing are automatic conversion between primitive  types and matching object types  wrappers , also covered in Chapter 5.     Enumerations define static final ordered sets of values using the   enum keyword; covered in Chapter 5.     Varargs are the last parameter of a method is declared using a type   name followed by three dots  String... , which implies that any  number of arguments of that type can be provided and is placed into  an array; covered in Chapter 3.     Enhanced for each loop is used to iterate over collections and arrays   too; covered in Chapter 5.  Improved semantics for multithreaded Java programs, covered in  Chapter 7.     Static imports are covered in Chapter 5.  Improvements for RMI  not covered in the book , Swing  Chapter 10 ,  concurrency utilities  Chapter 7 , and introduction to the Scanner  class; covered in Chapter 11.          Java 5 was the first available for Mac OS X  version 10.4  and the default version   installed on Mac OS X  version 10.5 . There were a lot of updates8 released for this  version to fix issues related to security and performance. It was a pretty buggy release,  which is understandable since quite a lot of features were developed in only two years.  8 Let’s call them what they actually are: hotfixes.  13   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  In 2006, Java SE 6 was released with a little delay, with the codename Mustang. Yes,  yet another rename. And yes, yet again a serious number of features were implemented  in a short period of time and a lot of updates followed. This was the last major Java  release by Sun Microsystems. Oracle acquired the company in January 2010. Let’s take a  look at the most important features in this release:     Dramatic performance improvements for the core platform    applications run faster, need less memory or CPU to execute               Improved web service support  optimized components that are  required for development of web applications   JDBC 4.0  optimized components that are required for development  of applications using databases   Java Compiler API  basically, from your code you can components  that are used to compile code      Many GUI improvements, such as integration of SwingWorker in   the API, table sorting and filtering, and true Swing double-buffering   eliminating the gray-area effect ; basically, improvement of  components used to create interfaces for desktop applications  In December 2008, Java FX 1.0 SDK was released. JavaFX is used to create graphical   user interfaces for any platform, and the initial version was a scripting language. Until  2008, there were two ways to create a user interface in Java:     AWT  Abstract Window Toolkit  components, which are rendered   and controlled by a native peer component specific to the underlying  operating system; that is why AWT components are also called  heavyweight components.     Swing components, which are called lightweight because they do  not require allocation of native resources in the operating system’s  windowing toolkit. The Swing API is a complimentary extension   of AWT.  In the first versions, it was never really clear if JavaFX would actually have a future   and grow up to replace Swing. The management turmoil inside Sun did not help in  defining a clear path for the project either.  14   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory   Oracle Takes Over Although Sun Microsystems won a lawsuit against Microsoft, in which they agreed to pay  $20 million for not implementing the Java 1.1 standard completely, in 2008, the company  was in such poor shape that negotiations for a merger with IBM and Hewlett-Packard  began. In 2009, Oracle and Sun announced that they agreed on the price: Oracle would  acquire Sun for $9.50 a share in cash; this amounted to a $5.6 billion offer. The impact  was massive. A lot of engineers quit, including James Gosling, the father of Java, which  made a lot of developers question the future of the Java platform.  Java SE 7, codename Dolphin, was the first Java version released by Oracle in  2011. It was the result of an extensive collaboration between Oracle engineers and  members of the worldwide Java communities, like the OpenJDK Community and the  Java Community Process  JCP . It contained a lot of changes, but still, a lot fewer than  developers expected. Considering the long period between the releases, the expectations  were pretty high. Project Lambda, which was supposed to allow usage of lambda  expressions in Java  this leads to considerable syntax simplification in certain cases , and  Jigsaw  making JVM and the Java application modular; there is a section in Chapter 3  about them  were dropped. Both were released in future versions. The following are the  most notable features in Java 7.      JVM support for dynamic languages with the new invokedynamic  bytecode  basically, Java code can use code implemented in non-Java  languages, such as C      Compressed 64-bit pointers  internal optimization of the JVM, so less   memory is consumed      Small language changes grouped under project Coin   – strings in switch  covered in Chapter 7    – automatic resource management in try-statement  covered in Chapter 5    – improved type inference for generics—the diamond   operator  covered in   Chapter 5    – binary integer literals  covered in Chapter 5    – multiple exceptions handling improvements  covered in Chapter 5      Concurrency improvements  15   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory     New I O library  new classes added to read write data to from files,   covered in Chapter 8       Timsort to sort collections and arrays of objects instead of merge  sort  Sets of data that are ordered need to be sorted using an  algorithm, basically, in this version, the algorithm was replaced with  one that has better performance. Better performance usually means  reducing of consumed resources: memory and or CPU, or reducing  the time needed for execution.   It must have been difficult to pick up a project and update it with almost none of the  original development team involved. That can be seen in the 161 updates that followed;  most of them needed to fix security issues and vulnerabilities.  JavaFX 2.0 was released with Java 7. This confirmed that the JavaFX project had a  future with Oracle. As a major change, JavaFX stopped being a scripting language and  became a Java API. This meant that knowledge of the Java language syntax would be  enough to start building user graphical interfaces with it. JavaFX started gaining ground  over Swing because of its hardware-accelerated graphical engine called Prism that did a  better job at rendering.  Java SE 8, codename Spider, was released in 2014, and included features that were   initially intended to be part of Java 7. But, better late than never, right? Three years in the  making, Java 8 contained the following key features.     Language syntax changes  features    – Language-level support for lambda expressions  functional programming    – Support for default methods in interfaces  covered in Chapter 4    – New date and time API  covered in Chapter 5    – New way to do parallel processing by using streams  covered in Chapter 8       Improved integration with JavaScript  the Nashorn project .  JavaScript is a web scripting language that is quite loved in the  development community, so providing support for it in Java probably  won Oracle a few new supporters.      Improvements of the garbage collection process  16   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  Starting with Java 8, codenames were dropped to avoid any trademark-law hassles;   instead, a semantic versioning that easily distinguishes major, minor, and security-  update releases was adopted.9 The version number matches the following pattern:  $MAJOR.$MINOR.$SECURITY  When executing java -version in a terminal  if you have Java 8 installed , you see   something similar to the following log.  $ java -version java version "1.8.0_162" JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 1.8.0_162-b12 Java HotSpotTM 64-Bit Server VM build 25.162-b12, mixed mode  In this log, the version numbers have the following meaning:     The 1 represents the major version number, incremented for a major   release that contains significant new features as specified in a new  edition of the Java SE Platform Specification.     The 8 represents the minor version number, incremented for a minor   update release that may contain compatible bug fixes, revisions to  standard APIs and other small features.     The 0 represents the security level that is incremented for a security-  update release that contains critical fixes, including those necessary  to improve security. $SECURITY is not reset to zero when $MINOR is  incremented, which lets the users know that this version is a more  secure one.  162 is the build number.          b12 represents additional build information.  This versioning style is quite common for Java applications, thus this versioning style   was adopted to align with the general industry practices.  Java SE 9 was released in September 2017. The long-awaited Jigsaw project was   finally here. The Java platform is finally modular.  9 Java Enhancement Proposal 223: http:  openjdk.java.net jeps 223  17   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  !  this is a big change for the Java world; it’s not a change in syntax and it’s not  some new feature. It’s a change in the design of the platform. some experienced  developers I know, who have used Java since its first years have difficulties  adapting. It is supposed to fix some serious problems that Java has been living  with for years  covered in Chapter 3 . you are lucky because, as a beginner,  you start from scratch, so you do not need to change the way you develop your  applications.  The following are the most important features, aside the introduction of Java   modules.10     The Java Shell tool, an interactive command-line interface for   evaluation declarations, statements, and expressions written in Java   covered in Chapter 3      Quite a few security updates          Improved try-with-resources: final variables can now be used as  resources  covered in Chapter 5   "_" is removed from the set of legal identifier names  covered in  Chapter 4      Support for private interface methods  covered in Chapter 5      Enhancements for the Garbage-First  G1  garbage collector; this   becomes the default garbage collector  covered in Chapter 13       Internally, a new more compact String representation is used   covered in Chapter 5      Concurrency updates  related to parallel execution, mentioned in   Chapter 5      Factory methods for collections  covered in Chapter 5      Updates of the image processing API optimization of components   used to write code that processes images  10 A detailed description of all JDK 9 features can be found here: https:  docs.oracle.com   javase 9 whatsnew toc.htmJSNEW-GUID-983469B6-9BB5-48CA-B71D-8D7012B2F3CA  18   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  Java 9 followed the same versioning scheme as Java 8, with a small change. The Java  version number contained in the name of the JDK finally became the $MAJOR number in  the version scheme. So, if you have Java 9 installed, when executing java -version in a  terminal, you see something similar to the following log.  $ java  -version java version "9.0.4" JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build 9.0.4+11 Java HotSpotTM 64-Bit Server VM build 9.0.4+11, mixed mode  Java SE 10  AKA Java 18.3  was released on March 20, 2018. Oracle changed the Java   release style, so a new version is released every six months. Also, Java 10 uses the new  versioning convention set up by Oracle: the version numbers follow a $YEAR.$MONTH  format.11 Apparently, this release versioning style is supposed to make it easier for  developers or end users to figure out the age of a release so that they can judge whether  to upgrade it to a newer release with the latest security fixes and additional features.  The following are a few features of Java 10.12     A local-variable type inference to enhance the language to extend   type inference to local variables  this is the most expected feature and  is covered in Chapter 5      More optimizations for garbage collection  covered in Chapter 13      Application Class-Data Sharing to reduce the footprint by sharing   common class metadata across processes  this is an advanced feature  that won’t be covered in the book      More concurrency updates  related to parallel execution, mentioned   in Chapter 5      Heap allocation on alternative memory devices  The memory   needed by JVM to run a Java program—called heap memory—can be  allocated on an alternative memory device, so the heap can also be  split between volatile and non-volatile RAM. More about memory  used by Java applications can be read in Chapter 5.   11 Java Enhancement Proposal 322: http:  openjdk.java.net jeps 322 12 The complete list can be found at http:  openjdk.java.net projects jdk 10  and the   release notes containing the detailed list with API and internal changes can be found at http:   www.oracle.com technetwork java javase 10-relnote-issues-4108729.html10-relnote- issues-4108729.html  19   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  And since we’ve done this before, let’s see what running java -version in a terminal   shows for this Java version.  $ java -version java version "10" 2018-03-20 JavaTM SE Runtime Environment 18.3 build 10+46 Java HotSpotTM 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 build 10+46, mixed mode  Java SE 11  AKA Java 18.9 13  released on 25 September 2018  contains the following   features:     Removal of JEE advanced components used to build enterprise Java  applications and Corba  really old technology for remote invocation,  allowing your application to communicate with applications installed  on a different computer  modules     Local-variable syntax for lambda parameters allow the var keyword  to be used when declaring the formal parameters of implicitly typed  lambda expressions     Epsilon, a low-overhead garbage collector  is a no-GC, so   basically you can run an application without a GC , basically more  optimizations to the garbage collection  covered in Chapter 13      More concurrency updates  related to parallel execution, mentioned   in Chapter 5   Aside from these changes, it was also speculated that a new versioning change   should be introduced because the $YEAR.$MONTH format did not go so well with  developers.  Why so many versioning naming changes, right? Is this really so important?  Apparently, it is.  The proposed versioning change is similar to the one introduced in  Java 9, and if you are curious, you can read a detailed specification for it at   http:  openjdk.java.net jeps 322.  When this chapter was written, JDK 11 was available only via the early access   program, which is why the "ea" string is present in the version name; it means early  access. It is quite difficult to use it, as it is not supported by any editors or other build  tools yet. By the time this book is released, Java 11 will be stable and ready to use and the  sources for the book are updated accordingly on the GitHub repository.  13 Details are at http:  openjdk.java.net projects jdk 11   20   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory  $ java -version java version "11-ea" 2018-09-18 JavaTM SE Runtime Environment 18.9 build 11-ea+2 Java HotSpotTM 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 build 11-ea+2, mixed mode  And this is where the details end. If you want more information on the first 20 years   of Java’s life, you can find it on Oracle’s website.14   What the Future Holds Java has dominated the industry for more than 20 years. It wasn’t always at the top of the  most-used development technologies, but it never left the top five since its existence.  Even with server-side JavaScript smart frameworks, like Node.js, the heavy-lifting is still  left to Java. Emerging programming languages like Scala and Kotlin run on the JVM, so  maybe the Java programming language will suffer a serious metamorphosis in order to  compete, but it will still be here.  The modularization possibility introduced in version 9 opens the gates for Java applications   to be installed on smaller devices, because to run a Java application, we no longer need  the whole runtime—only its core plus the modules the application was built with.  Also, there are a lot of applications written in Java, especially in the financial domain,   so Java will still be here, because of legacy reasons and because migrating these titan  applications to another technology is an impossible mission.  Java will probably survive and be on top for the next 10 to 15 years. It does help that it is  a very mature technology with a huge community built around it. And the fact that is easy to  learn and developer-friendly makes it remain the first choice for most companies. So, you  might conclude at this point that learning Java and buying this book is a good investment.   Prerequisites Before ending this chapter, it is only fair to tell you that to learn Java, you need to know or  have a few things….     Your way around an operating system, such as Windows,    Linux or macOS  14 The first 20 years of Java’s life: http:  oracle.com.edgesuite.net timeline java   21   Chapter 1    an IntroduCtIon to Java and Its hIstory     How to refine your search criteria, because information related to   your operating systems is not covered in the book; if you have issues,  you must fix them yourself     An Internet connection  If you already know Java, and you just bought this book out of curiosity or for the  modules chapter, knowing about a build tool like Maven or Gradle is helpful, because  the source code is organized in a multimodule project that can be fully built with one  simple command. I’ve chosen to use a build tool because in this day and age, learning  Java without one makes no sense; any company you apply to most definitely uses one.  Aside from the prerequisites that I listed, nothing else is needed. You do not need to   know math, algorithms, or design patterns. Actually, you might end up knowing a few  after you read this book.  This being said, let’s dig in.  22   CHAPTER 2  Preparing Your  Development Environment  To start learning Java, you need a few things installed on your computer. The following  are the requirements:      Java support on your computer  kinda’ mandatory .     An integrated development environment, also known as IDE, which  is basically an application in which you write your code and that you  use to compile and execute it.     The recommended IDE for this book is IntelliJ IDEA. You can  go to their website to get the free community edition; for the  purposes of the book, it will do.     Or, you can choose the most popular free IDE for Java   development: Eclipse.     Or, you can try NetBeans,1 which is the default choice for most   beginners because it was bundled with the JDK until version 8.2,3  1 Get it from here https:  netbeans.org  2 See: http:  www.oracle.com technetwork java javase downloads jdk-netbeans- jsp-142931.html 3 For Eclipse and NetbeansNetBeans, you will need to install a plugin for Gradle support.    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_2  23   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT     Gradle is a build tool used to organize projects, to easily handle   dependencies, and make your work easier as your projects get bigger.   It is mandatory because the projects in this book are organized and  built on a Gradle setup.      Git is a versioning system that you can use to get the sources for the  book, and you can experiment with it and create your own version.  It is optional because GitHub, which is where the sources for this  chapter are hosted, supports direct download.4  To write and execute Java programs applications, you only need the Java   Development Kit installed. All other tools that I’ve listed here are only needed to make  your job easier and to familiarize you with a real development job.  !  You probably need administrative rights if you install these applications for all  users. For Windows 10, you might even need a special application to give your user  administrative rights so you can install the necessary tools. This book provides  instructions on how to install everything—assuming your user has the necessary  rights. If you need more information, the Internet is there to help.  If it seems like a lot, do not get discouraged; this chapter contains instructions on  how to install and verify that each of tool is working accordingly. Let’s start by making  sure your computer supports Java.   Installing Java Here you are with your computer and you can’t wait to start writing Java applications.  But first, you need to get yourself a JDK and install it. For this, you need an Internet  connection to open https:  developer.oracle.com java.  4 Also, I don’t think there is a company that does not use a versioning system these days, so getting  comfortable with Git could be a serious advantage when applying for a software developer  position.  24   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Scroll down until you see the Downloads section. Click the Java SE link. The two   links and their contents are depicted in Figure 2-1.  Figure 2-1.  Navigating the Oracle site to find the desired product, JDK in this case  25   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  On the Oracle site, you find the latest stable Java version. Click the Download JDK   button. You should be redirected to the page depicted in Figure 2-2.  Figure 2-2.  The Oracle page where you can download the desired JDK  As you can see, JDK is available for a few operating systems. You should download   the one matching yours. For writing this book and the source code, I used a macOS  computer, which means I download the JDK with the .dmg extension.  You need to accept the license agreement before being allowed to download the  desired JDK. You can read it if you are curious, but basically, it tells you that you are  allowed to use Java as long as you do not modify its original components. It also tells you  that you are responsible for how you use it, so if you use it to write or execute dangerous  applications, you are legally responsible.  26   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  If you want to get your hands on an early version of JDK that is not officially released  yet, go to http:  openjdk.java.net projects jdk . Under Releases, versions 10 and  11, an early access  unstable  JDK 11 is available for download.  !  This book covers Java specifics until Java 11, but that version was eight  months away when this chapter was written, so some images and details might  seem deprecated. Keep in mind that there are common details that remain the  same from one version to the next, and those won’t be reviewed and changed, as  the only thing that is different is the version number. Since this book was planned  to be released after Java 11 was released, it is recommended to download that  version of the JDK to have full compatibility of the sources.  After you download the JDK, the next step is to install it. Just double-click it and   click Next until finished. This works for Windows and macOS. The JDK is installed in a  specific location.  In Windows, it is C:\ProgramFiles\Java\jdk-10. In macOS, it is  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk-10.jdk Contents Home. On Linux systems, depending on the distribution, the JDK install location varies. My   preferred way is to get the *.tar.gz from the Oracle site that contains the full content  of the JDK, unpack it, and copy it to a specific location. Also, my preferred location on  Linux is  home iuliana.cosmina tools jdk-10.jdk.  !  using a ppa  repository 5 installer on linux puts the JDK files where they are  supposed to go on linux automatically and updates them automatically when a  new version is released using the linux  global  updater utility. But if you are using  linux proficiently, you’ve probably figured this out.  If you go to that location, you can inspect the contents of the JDK. In Figure 2-3, the   contents of JDK 10 are on the left; the contents of the JDK 8 are on the right.  5 Also known as a Package Manager  27   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-3.  JDK version 8 and ten contents comparison  I chose to make this comparison because, starting with Java 9, the content of the   JDK is organized differently. Until Java 8, the JDK contained a directory called jre  that contained a Java Runtime Environment  JRE  used by the JDK. The lib directory  contains Java libraries and support files needed by development tools.  The bin contains a set of Java executables for running Java applications. Starting in Java 9, the JRE was no longer isolated in its own directory. In the    Figure 2- 4, you see the contents of the JDK 10 on the left, and the contents of the JRE 10  on the right.6  Figure 2-4.  JDK 10 and JRE contents compared  6 JDK and JRE 10 have the same directory structure introduced in version 9.  28   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  The directory structure depicted was introduced when Java 9 was released. You can   read more about it on the official Oracle site.7  The most important thing you need to know about the JDK is that the bin directory   contains executables and command-line launchers that are defined by the modules  linked to the image, thus the JDK has a few of those extra compared to the JRE. The other  directories are the jmods directory, which contains the compiled module definitions, and  the include directory, which contains the C-language header files that support native- code programming with the Java Native Interface  JNI  and the Java Virtual Machine   JVM  Debug Interface.   The JAVA_HOME Environment Variable The most important directory in the JDK is the bin directory, because that directory  has to be added to the path of your system so you can call the Java executables  from anywhere. This allows other applications to call them as well, without extra  configurations steps needed. Most IDEs used for handling8 Java code are written in Java,  and they require knowing where the JDK is installed so that they can be run. This is done  by declaring an environment variable named JAVA_HOME that points to the location of the  JDK directory. To make the Java executables callable from any location within a system,  you must add the bin directory to the system path. The next three sections explain how  to do this on the three most common operating systems.  7 The new directory structure introduced with Java 9 is explained in detail at https:   docs.oracle.com javase 9 install installed-directory-structure-jdk-and-jre. htmJSJIG-GUID-F7178F2F-DC92-47E9-8062-CA6B2612D350 8 Includes operations like writing the code, analyzing the code, compiling it, and executing it.  29    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  ChapTer 2   JAVA_HOME on Windows To declare the JAVA_HOME environment variable on a Windows system, you need to open  the dialog window for setting up system variables. On Windows systems, click the Start  button; in the menu, there is a search box  or right-click the Start button for a context-  menu and select Search . Enter the word environment in there  the first three letters  should suffice  and the option should become available for clicking. These steps are  depicted in Figure 2-5.  Figure 2-5.  Windows menu item to configure environment variables  30   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  After clicking that menu item, a window like the one shown in Figure 2-6 should   open.  Figure 2-6.  First dialog window to set environment variables on Windows  Click the Environment Variables button. Another dialog window opens, which is   split into two sections: user variables and system variables. You are interested in system  variables because that is where we declare JAVA_HOME. Just click the New... button and a  small dialog window appears with two text fields; one requires you to enter the variable  name—JAVA_HOME in this case, and one requires you to enter the path—to the JDK in  this case. The second window and the variable information pop-up dialog window are  depicted in Figure 2-7.  31   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-7.  Declaring JAVA_HOME as a system variable on Windows  After defining the JAVA_HOME variable, you need to add the executables to the system   path. This can be done by editing the Path variable. Just select it from the System  Variables list and click the Edit... button. Starting in Windows 10, each part of the Path  variable is shown on a different line, so you can add a different line and add %JAVA_ HOME%\bin on it. This syntax is practical because it takes the location of the bin directory  from whatever location the JAVA_HOME variable contains. The dialog window is depicted  in Figure 2-8.  32   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-8.  Declaring the JDK executables directory as part of the system Path  variable on Windows 10  On older Windows systems, the contents of the Path variable are depicted in  the dialog box shown in Figure 2-7, so you must add the %JAVA_HOME%\bin text in  the Variable value text field, and separate it from the existing content by using a  semicolon  ; .  No matter which Windows system you have, you can check that you set everything   correctly by opening Command Prompt and executing the set command. This lists  all the system variables and their values. JAVA_HOME and Path should be there with the  desired values. For the setup proposed in this section when executing set the output is  depicted in Figure 2-9.  33   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-9.  Windows system variables listed with the set command  If you execute the previous command and see the expected output and then execute   java -version in the command prompt, it prints the expected result. You are all set.  ...> java -version java version "10-ea" 2018-03-20 Java TM  SE Runtime Environment 18.3  build 10-ea+42  Java HotSpot TM  64-Bit Server VM 18.3  build 10-ea+42, mixed mode   34   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT   JAVA_HOME on macOS The location in which JDK is installed is  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk-  10.jdk Contents Home. Your JAVA_HOME should point to this location. To do this for the  current user, you can do the following:    1.   In the  Users your.user directory, create a file named   .bash_profile.    2.   In this file, write the following:  export JAVA_HOME=$  usr libexec java_home -v10   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME bin:$PATH  On macOS, you can simultaneously install multiple Java versions. You can set which   version is the one currently used on the system by obtaining the JDK location for the  desired version by calling the  usr libexec java_home command and giving the Java  version you are interested in as the argument. The result of executing the command is  stored as a value for the JAVA_HOME variable.  On my system, I have JDK 8, 9, 10, and 11 installed. If I execute the command, giving   an argument to each of the Java versions, look at what happens:  $  usr libexec java_home -v11  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk-11.jdk Contents Home  $  usr libexec java_home -v10  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk-10.jdk Contents Home  $  usr libexec java_home -v9  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk-9.0.4.jdk Contents Home  $  usr libexec java_home -v1.8  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk1.8.0_162.jdk Contents Home  Depending of the version given as argument, a different JDK location is returned. If   you want to test the value of the JAVA_HOME, the echo command can help with that.  $ echo $JAVA_HOME  Library Java JavaVirtualMachines jdk-10.jdk Contents Home  35   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  The line export PATH=$JAVA_HOME bin:$PATH adds the contents of the bin directory   from the JDK location to the system patch. This means that I could open a terminal and  execute any of the Java executables under it. For example, I could verify that the Java  version set as default for my user is the expected one by executing java –version.  $ java -version java version "10-ea" 2018-03-20 Java TM  SE Runtime Environment 18.3  build 10-ea+42  Java HotSpot TM  64-Bit Server VM 18.3  build 10-ea+42, mixed mode   If you do all of this and java -version prints the expected result, you are all set.   JAVA_HOME on Linux  !  If you are using linux proficiently, you probably are using a ppa, so you can  skip this section. But if you like to control where the JDK is and define your own  environment variables, keep reading.  Linux systems are Unix-like operating systems. This is similar to macOS, which is   based on Unix. Depending on your Linux distribution, installing Java can be done via the  specific package manager or by directly downloading the JDK as a *.tar.gz archive from  the official Oracle site.  If Java is installed using a package manager, the necessary executables are usually   automatically placed in the system path at installation time. That is why in this book, we  cover only the cases where you do everything manually, and choose to install Java only  for the current user in a location such as  home your.user tools jdk-10.jdk,9 because  covering package managers is not the object of the book after all.10  9 Replaces your.user with your actual system username  10 Linux users do not really need this section anyway.’  36   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  So, after downloading the JDK archive from the Oracle site and unpacking it at     home your.user tools jdk-10.jdk, you need to create a file named either .bashrc or  .bash_profile11 in your user home directory and add the following to it.  export JAVA_HOME= home your.user tools jdk-10.jdk  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME bin:$PATH  As you can see, the syntax is similar to macOS. To check the location of the JDK and   the Java version, same commands mentioned in the macOS section can be used.   Installing Gradle   Gradle 5.x ** The sources attached to this book can be compiled and executed   using the Gradle wrapper, which is a batch script on Windows and a shell script for other  operating systems. When you start a Gradle build via the wrapper, Gradle automatically  downloads and runs the build; thus you do not to really need to install Gradle.  Instructions on how to do this can be found by reading the public documentation at   www.gradle.org docs current userguide gradle_wrapper.html.  A good practice is to keep code and build tools separate, and for the project attached   to this book this is the recommended way to go.  If you decide to use Gradle outside the editor, you can download the binaries only     or if you are curious, you can download the full package, which contains binaries,  sources, and documentation  from the official site  www.gradle.org , unpack them, and  copy the contents somewhere on the hard drive. Create a GRADLE_HOME environment  variable and point it to the location where you have unpacked Gradle. Also, add  %GRADLE_HOME%\bin for Windows, or $GRADLE_HOME bin for Unix-based operating  systems, to the general path of the system.  Gradle was chosen as a build tool for the sources of this book because of the easy   setup, small configuration files, flexibility in defining execution tasks, and because it is  practical to learn a build tool—because for medium-sized and large projects, they are a  must-have.  11 On some Linux distributions, the file might already exist, you just need to edit it.  37   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  !  verify that the version of gradle the operating system sees is the one you just  installed by opening a terminal  Command Prompt in Windows, and any type of  terminal you have installed on macoS and linux  and entering  gradle -version  You should see something similar to this: ------------------------------------------------------------ Gradle 5.0-20180826235923+0000 ------------------------------------------------------------ Build time:   2018-08-26 23:59:23 UTC Revision:     c2edb259761ee18f9a14e271f24ef58530b1300f Kotlin DSL:   1.0-rc-3 Kotlin:       1.2.60 Groovy:       2.4.15 Ant:          Apache Ant  TM  version 1.9.11 compiled on March 23 2018 JVM:          10  Oracle Corporation 10+46  OS:           -- whatever operating system you have --  The preceding text is confirmation that Gradle commands can be executed in your   terminal; thus, Gradle was installed successfully.   Installing Git This is an optional section, but as a developer, being familiar with a versioning system  is important, so here it is. To install Git on your system, just go to the official page at  https:  git-scm.com downloads and download the installer. Open the installer and  click Next until done. This works for Windows and macOS.12 Yes, it is this easy. You do  not need to do anything else.13 For Linux, you can use your package manager or PPA to  install Git.  12 For macOS, you can use homebrew as well. 13 Just in case, here is a page with instructions on how to install Git for all operating systems:   https:  gist.github.com derhuerst 1b15ff4652a867391f03  38   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  To test that Git installed successfully on your system, open a terminal  Command   Prompt in Windows, and any type of terminal you have installed on macOS and Linux   and run git --version to see the result that it is printed. It should be the version of Git  that you just installed.  $ git –version git version 2.15.1  Now that you have Git installed, you can get the sources for this book by cloning the  official Git repository in a terminal or directly from the IDE. But more about this a little  bit later.   Installing a Java IDE The editor that I recommend, based on my experience of more than ten years, is IntelliJ  IDEA. It is produced by a company called JetBrains. You can download this IDE from  their official site at www.jetbrains.com. There is an Ultimate Edition available that  you can use for free for 30 days; after that, you need to acquire a license. That is why I  recommend you download and use the Community Edition,14 because for the simple  development involved in learning Java, this version suffices.  After you download the IntelliJ IDEA archive, double-click it to install it. After that,   start it to do a couple of configurations. Just click the Next button until you get to the  plugin selection step, which should be very similar to the one depicted in Figure 2-10.  14 The IntelliJ IDEA download page is at https:  www.jetbrains.com idea download   39   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-10.  IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition configure plugins dialog section  In the previous image, two sections were underlined. The first section configures   build tools. If you click Customize... button, the window should change to show you the  plugins that are available for build tools. Make sure that the option for Gradle is checked,  as depicted in Figure 2-11, then click the Save Changes and Go Back button.  40   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-11.  IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition configure Gradle plugin  The second section configures support for versioning control systems. If you click   the Customize... button, the window should show you which plugins are available  for versioning systems. Make sure that the options for Git and GitHub are checked, as  depicted in Figure 2-12, and then click the Save Changes and Go Back button. If you go  another step forward, you get to another plugin screen that offers you the possibility to  install a plugin called IDE Feature Trainer. I think if you are a beginner, a plugin might  be very useful. The window is depicted in Figure 2-13  Figure 2-12.  IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition configure Git plugin  For the final step, click the Install button, and then Start using IntelliJ IDEA, and   you are all set up and good to go. Your development environment is fully configured and  ready for you to write your first Java program.  41   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  Figure 2-13.  IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition configure IDE Feature Trainer  plugin  But before doing that, let’s also cover how to retrieve the sources for the book. There are three ways to get the sources for the book:     Download the zipped package directly from GitHub.     Clone the repository using a terminal  or Git Bash Shell in Windows    using the following command:  git clone git@github.com:Apress java-for-absolute- beginners.git     Clone the project using IntelliJ IDEA. For this and cloning from   the command line, you need a GitHub user. The following images  show all the dialog windows that you see when cloning the project  with IntelliJ IDEA. Figure 2-14 shows the window that you see after   42   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  you start an IntelliJ IDEA instance that was never used. The project  is hosted on GitHub, so from the Check out from Version Control  menu, select GitHub. At this point, you to the next dialog window,  depicted in Figure 2-15.  Figure 2-14.  IntelliJ IDEA first dialog window to clone the java-for-absolute- beginners project  Figure 2-15.  IntelliJ IDEA second dialog window to clone the java-for-absolute- beginners project  43   ChapTer 2    preparIng Your DevelopmenT envIronmenT  This requires you to insert your GitHub username and password  Auth Type:   Password . If you do not have a GitHub username, go to https:  github.com to create  one. After clicking the Login button, the window depicted in Figure 2-16 is shown.  Figure 2-16.  IntelliJ IDEA third dialog window to clone the java-for-absolute- beginners project  Click the Clone button and move on to the window depicted in Figure 2-17.  Figure 2-17.

All the software technologies introduced in  this chapter are backed up by documented and comprehensive official websites and by  huge communities of developers eager to help. And in the worst-case scenario, you can  always create an issue on the Apress GitHub official repository for this book, or drop me  an email. I’ll do my best to support you if need be.  But I think you will be fine. Java is hardly rocket-science.15  15 Well, it wasn’t until Java 9. But this book should make it easier for beginner developers.  47   CHAPTER 3  Getting Your Feet Wet  This is the last introductory chapter in the book. After this one, we get to the serious  business. The previous chapter left you with a complete development environment  configured for writing Java code. It is time to make use of it. The following topics are  covered in this chapter:     Using JShell      Java fundamental building blocks: packages, modules, and classes     Creating a Java project with IntelliJ IDEA     Compiling and executing Java classes     Packing a Java application into an executable jar     Using Gradle to automate compiling and test execution   Using JShell Introduced in Java 9, the Java Shell tool  JShell  is an interactive tool for learning the  Java programming language and prototyping Java code. This means that you can write  Java code and execute it in the console, without the need to save it to a file, which is later  compiled into bytecode and then interpreted by the underlying OS as a sequence of  instructions to run to execute it. JShell is quite late to the party, as scripting languages  like Python and Node introduced similar utilities years ago, and JVM languages like  Scala, Clojure, and Groovy adopted it some time ago. But, better late than never is still  acceptable.  JShell is a Read-Eval-Print Loop  REPL , which evaluates declarations, statements,   and expressions as they are entered, and then it immediately shows the results. It  is practical to try new ideas and techniques quickly and without the need to have a  complete development environment or an entire context for the code to be executed in.

Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_3  49   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  JShell is a standard component of the JDK and the executable to start it, is in the bin   directory located in the JDK installation directory. This means that all you have to do  is open a terminal  Command Prompt in Windows, and any type of terminal you have  installed on macOS and Linux  and type jshell. You should see something like this:1  $ jshell     Welcome to JShell -- Version 10     For an introduction type:  help intro  Go ahead and enter  help to view a list of all the available actions and commands.  jshell>  help   Type a Java language expression, statement, or declaration.   Or type one of the following commands:    list  -all-start           list the source you have typed    edit             edit a source entry    drop             delete a source entry ...    exit             exit the jshell tool ...  To see exactly what JShell is doing, we can start it in verbose mode by adding -v as   an argument when starting it. Let’s play with a few numbers and see what happens. First,  let’s start the JShell in a verbose mode, so we’ll have a report log of everything that JShell  does when we insert statements. In your terminal, of enter java -v.  $ jshell -v   Welcome to JShell -- Version 10-ea   For an introduction type:  help intro  1 Since this book covers Java notions up to Java 11, you can install JDK 11 and work with it, if it has  been released by the time you get this book. While writing the book, I installed a new JDK as soon  as it was available, but tried to keep the version 10 as a constant version throughout the book, as  to avoid confusion.  50   In Java, values are assigned to sequences of characters named variables.  More   about how to name them and use them in Chapter 4.  Next, let’s create a variable of type  integer  int in Java  and give it the value of 42. To do this, enter int i=42.  Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  As you can see, the log message is clear and tells us that our command was executed  successfully and the variable of type int was created. The line i ==> 42 lets us know that  value 42 was assigned to the variable that we just created.  Let’s declare another one named j. In the code snippet, below 35 is the value that we   assign to it. But you can try different numbers if you want to.  jshell> int i = 42 i ==> 42   created variable i : int  jshell> int j = 35 j ==> 35   created variable j : int  As long as the JShell session is not closed, the two previous variables still exist,   because we can further use them. Let’s add them together. The + operator sums two  integer variables in Java, just like in plain mathematics. Enter i + j.  jshell> i + j $3 ==> 77   created scratch variable $3 : int  As you can see, we added two variables but we did not store the result in a third,   thus JShell creates a scratch variable to store the result and print it in the log; but that  variable cannot be used in later statements, because it does not have a name.  All seems fine: variables are created and operations are executed correctly. Anything   that could be written in Java can be written in the JShell and executed.  51   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  !  the building blocks of Java are named classes, which are pieces of code that  model real-world objects and events. Classes contain two types of members:  those modelling to states, which are the class variables, also named fields or  properties, and those modelling behavior, named methods. JDK provides a lot  of classes that model the base components needed to create most applications.  Classes are covered in more detail in the next chapter and you create a lot of them  while reading this book. even if this terms and concepts seem foreign now, just be  patient, and let them add up; they will make more sense later.  In JShell, JDK classes can be used like java.lang.String  programming   components that you learn more about in Chapter 4 , which is the Java class that  represents text objects. And their methods can be called. Let’s declare our first String  variable.  jshell> String text = "this is a text"; text ==> "this is a text"   created variable text : String  We’ve just declared a variable of type String named text with the value of "this is   a text". The String class has many methods you can call to modify a text, let’s call one  with an obvious effect. Type text.toUpperCase  .  jshell> text.toUpperCase   $6 ==> "THIS  IS  A  TEXT"   created scratch variable $6 : String  The last statement is called a String method, which uppercases the variable   contents. But let’s see what happens when we introduce something that does not match  the Java syntax. Let’s call a method that does not exist for type String.  jshell> text.toAnotherUniverse     Error:   cannot find symbol     symbol:   method toAnotherUniverse     text.toAnotherUniverse     ^--------------------^  52   JShell is quite clear in telling us that the toAnotherUniverse   is unknown to it. Let’s   throw plain text in there. In the following, I tried "what is this?".  Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  In the first statement, we tried calling a method that is not defined for the String   class, and the error message was pretty relevant in regards to what we did wrong.  jshell> what is this?   Error:   ';' expected   what is this?          ^  We can even create our own methods.  jshell> String createHello String s {    ...> return "Hello " + s;    ...> }   created method createHello String  jshell> createHello text  $8 ==> "Hello this is a text"   created scratch variable $8 : String  Code completion2 is also available in JShell. Take the text variable that we defined  earlier, for example; if we enter text then put a "."  dot  after it and then press the Tab  key, the list of available methods is listed, as depicted in Figure 3-1. If you type a few  letters from the method name, filtering is applied. JShell suggests only the method  names that start with that combination of letters. Pretty helpful, right?  2 Also called code assistance  53   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-1.  JShell lists methods possible to call on a String variable  If you want to see all variables you have declared in a JShell play session, you can do   The preceding output corresponds to a sequence of statements executed in a JShell   so by executing the  vars command.  jshell>  vars     String text = "this is a text"     List  units = []     List  list1 = [One]     File f = .     Logger log = null  console that looks like this:  jshell> String text = "this is a text"         text ==> "this is a text"   created variable text : String jshell> List  units = new ArrayList            units ==> []   created variable units : List  jshell> List  list1 = new ArrayList            list1 ==> []   created variable list1 : List   54   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  jshell> list1.add "One" ;         $4 ==> true   created scratch variable $4 : boolean jshell> File f = new File "."          f ==> .   created variable f : File jshell> import java.util.logging.LogManager;  jshell> import java.util.logging.Logger;  jshell> Logger l = LogManager.getLogManager  .getLogger "sample" ; l ==> null   created variable l : Logger  If you want to save all your input from a JShell session, you can do so by executing   the  save [filename.java] command. It results in a file containing all Java statements  that you have executed with JShell within that session.  String text="this is a text"; List  units = new ArrayList   ; List  list1 = List.of "One" ; File f = new File "." ; import java.util.logging.Logger; import java.util.logging.LogManager; Logger log = LogManager.getLogManager  .getLogger "sample" ;  Also, assuming the preceding output is a list of Java statements exported by JShell   to a file called sample.java, using the command  save sample.java, all of those  statements can be executed into a new JShell session using the  open sample.java  command. So, all variables will be created and we can use them in the new session.  There is a JShell complete user guide available on the Oracle official site if you are   interested in trying every command and every feature it has to offer.3  If you have opened your JShell and tried yourself some of the commands listed in  this section, you already got your feet wet with a little Java syntax. But there is a reason  that there is an entire chapter for that, but until then, it is more helpful to know the  building blocks of the Java ecosystem.  3 Oracle JShell user guide: https:  docs.oracle.com javase 9 jshell toc.htm  55   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet   Java Fundamental Building Blocks  !  this is a consistent introduction into Java as a platform, but to write code  confidently, you need to have a grasp of what happens under the hood, what the  building blocks are, and how they are connected to each other. if you want, you  can skip the next section altogether, but in the same way some new drivers need  a little knowledge of how the engine works before grabbing the driving wheel,  some people might feel more confident and in control when programming if they  understand the mechanics a little. So, i wanted to make sure that anyone reading  this book gets a proper start.4  To write Java applications, a developer must be familiar with the Java building blocks   of the Java ecosystem. The core of this ecosystem is the class. There are other object  types in Java, but classes are the most important because they represent the templates  for the objects making up an application. A class groups fields and methods. When an  object is created, the values of the fields define the state of the object and the methods  describe its behavior.  !  the Java object is a model of a real-world object. So, if we choose to model  a car in Java, we choose to define fields that describe the car: manufacturer,  modelname, productionYear, and speed. the methods of our car class describe  what the car does; and a car does mainly two things: accelerates and brakes.  All object types are described in files with the *.java extension. Object types are   organized in packages. A package is a logical collection of types, some of them are  visible outside the package, and some of them are not, depending on their scope.   A package is a hierarchy of directories, with the Java object types on the last level   usually, but now always .  4 If you are worried that you will forget the keywords and meaning for modules, print the cheat  sheet at http:  files.zeroturnaround.com pdf RebelLabs-Java-9-modules-cheat-sheet. pdf and keep it handy.  56   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Package names must be unique and their name should follow a certain template.  Good practices say that to ensure unicity and meaning, you typically begin the name  with your organization’s Internet domain name in reverse order, then add various  grouping criteria. In this project, package names follow the template depicted here:  com.apress.bgn.ch[*]+  This template begins with the reversed domain name for Apress publisher  www.  apress.com , then a term identifying the book is added  bgn is a shortcut for beginner   and at last the ch plus the number of the package the source  usually  matches.  Starting with Java 5, each package can contain a file named package-info.java that  contains a package declaration, package annotations, package comments, and Javadoc  tags. The comments are exported to the Javadoc for that package and you learn how  to generate that with Gradle later. The package-info.java must reside under the last  directory in the package. So, if we define a com.apress.bgn.ch3 package, the overall  structure and contents of the Java project looks like Figure 3-2.5  Figure 3-2.  Java package contents  The package-info.java contents could be similar to this:   **  * Contains classes used for reading information from various sources.  * @since 1.0-SNAPSHOT  * @author iuliana.cosmina  * @version 1.0-SNAPSHOT  *  @Deprecated package com.apress.bgn.ch3;  5 The chapter03.iml is an IntelliJ IDEA project file.  57   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  The files with *.java extension containing the object types definitions are compiled   into files with *.class that are organized according to the package structure and  packaged into one or more JARs  Java Archives .6 For the previous example, if we were to  unpack the JAR resulted after the compilation and linkage, you would see what’s shown  in Figure 3-3.  Figure 3-3.  Contents of a sample JAR  !  package-info.java files are not mandatory, packages can be defined  without them. they are useful mostly for documentation purposes.  The code in one package might span multiple JARs, meaning if you have more than   one subproject7 in your project you can have the same package name in more than once,  containing different classes. A symbolic representation of all the preceding is depicted in  Figure 3-4.  6 When JARs are hosted on a repository, such as The Maven Public Repository, they are also called  artifacts. 7 I am deliberately avoiding the term module for now to avoid confusion between project modules  and Java modules.  58   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-4.  Java building blocks  A library groups one or more JARs.8 A Java application can make use of one or more libraries, and in order to be run,  needs all of its dependencies  all the JARs  on the classpath. What does this mean? It  means that to run a Java application, the JDK is needed, the dependencies  external  JARs  and the application jars. Figure 3-5 depicts this quite clearly.  Figure 3-5.  Classpath of an application  The JARs that make up an application classpath are  obviously  not always   independent of each other. For 21 years this organization style was enough, but in  complex applications there were a lot of complications caused by: packages scattered in   8 The most popular are logging libraries like Log4J.  https:  logging.apache.org log4j 2.x    and Logback  https:  logback.qos.ch    59   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  multiple jars, transitive dependencies between jars, which sometimes leads to different  versions of the same class on the classpath, missing transitive dependencies and  accessibility problems. All these problems are grouped under one name The Jar Hell.9  This problem was resolved in Java 9 by introducing another level to group packages, but  we should expect that there is The Module Hell at some point in the future.  Before introducing modules, access modifiers should be mentioned because Java  object types and members can declared with certain access rights within packages, and  that is something important to understand before jumping into coding.   Access Modifiers When you declare an object type in Java  let’s stick to class because it is the only one  mentioned so far , you can configure who should be able to use it. Access modifiers specify  access to classes, and in this case, we say that they are used at the top-level. They can also  specify access to class members, and in this case, they are used at member- level.10  At top-level only two access modifiers can be used: public and none. A top-level class that is declared public must be defined in a Java file with the same   name. So, the following class is defined in a file named Base.java stored under the com. apress.bgn.ch0 package.  package com.apress.bgn.ch0;    top-level access modifier public class Base {         ... }  The contents of the class are not depicted for the moment and replaced with ... to stop   you from losing focus. A public class is visible to all classes anywhere. So, a different class, in a  different package can create an object of this type, like in the following sample code:  9 A great article about The Jar Hell in case you want to know more, but you might want to read it  later, after you have written a little code of your own. See https:  tech-read.com 2009 01 13  what-is-jar-hell  10 I will not mention nested classes right now, as they are not really crucial for understanding this   section. But in the downloadable Appendix, there is a small section about nested and local  classes that you might find useful.  60   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  package com.apress.bgn.ch3;  import com.apress.bgn.ch0.Base; import  org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager; import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;  public class Main {    public static void main String... args  {               creating an object of type Base        Base base = new Base  ;    } }  !  For now, let this affirmation sink in: a public class is visible to all classes  everywhere.  The option to not use an access modifier it is called using the default or package-  private modifier.11 This means if a class has no access modifier, the class is only visible  to classes defined in the same package. A class without an access modifier can be  defined in any Java file, one that has the same name, or right next to the class that gives  the file its name. So, if we were to declare a class named HiddenBase in the Base.java file  as depicted in the following code snippet, trying to create an object of this type within  the Main class is not possible, because this class is in a different package.  package com.apress.bgn.ch0;  public class Base {         ... }  class HiddenBase{        you cannot see me outside the package }  11 I know it seems confusing that there are two names referring to the lack of access modifiers, but  as you might read other books or blog posts that refer to this situation, it is better to have all the  possibilities listed here.  61   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Sure, you can write the code, but the Java compiler will not compile it, and there is  no bytecode to execute. Also, smart Java editors very clearly show you the error of your  ways, by making your code red and refusing to provide any code assistance when writing  it. Figure 3-6 depicts how IntelliJ IDEA tries to tell me that I’m doing something wrong in  trying to access a package-private class.  Figure 3-6.  IntelliJ IDEA hinting that access to a package-private class leads to a  compilation error  In the same figure, the file containing the two classes is depicted in a rectangle to  attract your attention on how the editor is making it obvious that the two classes are  defined in the same Java file.  !  For now, take this affirmation and let it sink in: a class with no access  modifier is visible to all classes in the same package.  62   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Inside a class, the class members are defined: fields and methods.12 Access    modifiers can be applied to the class members as well, and at member-level, two  more modifiers can be applied: private and protected. At member-level, the access  modifiers have the following affects.              public: The same as at top level, the member can be accessed from  everywhere.  private: The member can only be accessed from within its own class.  protected: The member can only be accessed from within its own  package or by any subclass13 of its class in another package.      none: The member can only be accessed from within its own package.  If it seems complicated, it’s only until you begin writing code and getting used to it.   On the official Oracle documentation page, there is a table with the visibility of members,  depicted here in this book as Table 3-1.14  Table 3-1.  Member-Level Accessors  Modifier  public  protected  private  none  also referred to as default package-private   Class  Package  Subclass  World  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  no  Yes  Yes  no  no  Yes  no  no  no  You will probably come back to this table once or twice after you start writing Java   code. Everything in this table is still valid after the introduction of modules, but only  once you properly configure module access, of course.  12 Aside from that, we can also define other Java object types, which are referred to as nested, but   we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. 13 Creating a subclass is covered in Chapter 5. 14 I depicted the table to avoid the hassle of navigating to this URL: https:  docs.oracle.com   javase tutorial java javaOO accesscontrol.html  63    GettinG Your Feet Wet Chapter 3   Introducing Modules Starting with Java 9, a new concept was introduced: modules. They are used to group and  encapsulate packages. Implementation of this new concept took more than ten years. The  discussion about modules started in 2005, and it was proposed to be implemented for Java 7.   Under the name Project Jigsaw an exploratory phase started in 2008. Java developers  hoped a modular JDK would be available with Java 8, but it was made possible in Java 9,  after three years of work  and almost seven year of analysis . Apparently, this is why the  official release date for Java 9 was postponed to September 2017.15  Modules represent a new way to aggregate packages. A module is a way to group   them and configure more granulated access to package contents.  A module is a uniquely named, reusable group of packages and resources  XML   files  described by a file named module-info.java. This file contains the following  information:  the module’s name  the module’s dependencies  that is, other modules this module  depends on   the packages it explicitly makes available to other modules  all other  packages in the module are implicitly unavailable to other modules                                   the services it offers  the services it consumes  to what other modules it allows reflection     native code  resources  configuration data  In theory, module naming resembles package naming and follows the reversed-   domain- name convention. In practice, make sure that the module name does not  contain any numbers and that it reveals clearly what its purpose is. The module-info. java file is compiled into a module descriptor, which is a file named module-info.  15 The full history of the Jigsaw project can be found at http:  openjdk.java.net projects   jigsaw   64   class that is packed with classes into a plain old JAR file. The location of the file is in  the root sources directory, outside of any package. For the example introduced earlier, a  module- info.java was added and the new project structure is depicted in Figure 3-7.  Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-7.  Structure of a Java 9 project  As any file with the *.java extension, the module-info.java gets compiled into a   *.class file. As the module declaration is not a part of Java object types declaration,  module is not a Java keyword, so it can still be used when writing code for Java object types.  For package, the situation is different, as every Java object type declaration must start with  a package declaration. Take a look at the SimpleReader class, declared as follows.  package com.apress.bgn.ch3;  public class SimpleReader {      private String source;     ... }  So, what does this actually mean? Where is the module and what is it? Well, in   simple projects that are made of one root directory with sources, modules do not have to   physically delimit or organize sources. 16 They are defined by the contents of the module- info.java file. So, starting with Java 9, what is shown in Figure 3-4 evolves into Figure 3-8.  16 Unless you rename directories containing sources for a module to the module name. Having   actual directories for modules is unavoidable when the sources in the root directory of a project  must be split into different modules.  65   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-8.  Java building blocks, starting with Java 9  In Figure 3-8, there is no need to create a directory for the module in JAR1 and JAR2.   For JAR3, there are two modules archived in the same JAR; in this case, we need to explicitly  separate their sources. The reason for this is the need to have two module-info.java files, and  obviously no operating system allows two files in the same directory to have the same name. An  example of such a project is covered in the Appendix , which is available as part of the book’s  source code download  https:  github.com apress java-for-absolute-beginners .  The introduction of modules means the JDK is now divided into modules as well. This   means that the Java platform is no longer a monolith that consists of a massive number  of packages and making it challenging to develop, maintain, and evolve. The platform is  now split into 95 modules that can be viewed by executing java --list-modules  the  number might vary in Java later versions .   $ java --list-modules java.base@10 66   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  java.compiler@10 java.datatransfer@10 java.desktop@10 ...  module belongs to Java 10.  Each module name is followed by a version string, @10, which means that the   So, if a Java application does not require all modules, a runtime can be created only   with the modules that it needs, which reduces the runtime’s size. The tool to build a  smaller runtime customized to an application needs is called jlink, which is part of the  JDK executables. It allows larger levels of scalability and increased performance.17  There are multiple benefits of introducing modules, that more experienced   developers have been waiting for years to take advantage of. But configuring modules for  bigger and more complex projects is no walk in the park, so for the time being, a simple  configuration for a module containing one package is covered. After finishing this book,  you are welcome to read the Appendix, where a more advanced module configuration is  covered, with examples for each of the possible module configuration is presented.  The contents of the module-info.java can be as simple as the name of the module    Configuring Modules Within those brackets, different module directives may be declared, using one of the  following keywords:  and two brackets.  module chapter.three { }                  requires  exports  module  open  17 How to use jlink is not an object of this book. The focus of the book is learning the Java  programming language; thus, the technical details of the Java platform will be kept to a  minimum, just enough to start writing and executing code confidently.  67   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet              opens... to  provides ... with  transitive  are requires and exports.  module chapter.three {     requires chapter.zero; }  Each of them covers a specific behavior, but for a beginner, the most important two   Modules can depend on one another. For our example, classes inside the chapter.  three module need access to packages, and classes in the chapter.zero module.  Declaring a module dependency is done my using the requires keyword.  The preceding dependency is an explicit one. But there are also implicit   dependencies. For example, any module declared by a developer implicitly requires  the JDK java.base module. This module defines the foundational APIs of the Java SE  Platform, and no Java application could be written without it.  Declaring a module as required, means that that module is required at compile time  and runtime. If a module is required only at runtime, the requires static keywords are  used to declare the dependency. Keep that in mind for now; it will make sense when I  talk about web applications.  But is it enough to declare our module as dependent of another? Does this mean   that the dependent module can access all public types  and their nested public and  protected types ? If you are thinking not, you are right. Just because a module depends  on another, it does not mean it has access to the packages and classes that it needs to.  This is because the module it depends on must be configured to expose its insides. How  can that be done? In our case, we need to make sure module chapter.zero gives access  to the required packages. This is done by customizing the module-info.java for this  module by adding the exports directive, followed by the necessary package names.  module chapter.zero {     exports com.apress.bgn.ch0; }  68   By doing this we have given access to the com.apress.bgn.ch0 package to any   module that requires this package as a dependency. What if we do not want that?  Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  if you were curious and read the recommended Jar Hell article, you noticed   !  that one of the concerns of working with Java sources packed in Jars, was  security. Because even without access to Java sources, objects could be accessed,  extended, and instantiated by adding a Jar as a dependency to an application.  So, aside from providing a reliable configuration, better scaling, integrity for the  platform, and improved performance, the goal for introduction of modules was  better security.  What if we want to limit the access to module contents only to the chapter.three  module? This can be done by adding the to keyword followed by the module name to  the exports directive.  module chapter.zero {     exports com.apress.bgn.ch0 to chapter.three; }  More than one module can be specified to have access by listing the desired   modules, separated by comma.  module chapter.zero {     exports  com.apress.bgn.ch0  to  chapter.three,  chapter.two; }  And that’s about all you need to know about modules for the moment.   Determining the Structure: A Java Project  !  When this chapter was written, JDK 11 eap has just been released. Shortly  after, Gradle version 4.9 and intelliJ iDea version 2018.2 were released and they  fully supported development using JDK 11. So, from this section onward Java 11  will be referred in the rest of the book.  69   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  scope and the build tool used.  There are a few ways Java projects can be structured. It depends on the project’s   You might wonder why does the project scope influence its structure because you   expect there should be a standard for this, right? Well, there is more than one standard,  and that is dependent on the project scope, because the scope, the reason for creating a  Java project influences its size. And if a project is small, it might not require you to split  the sources into subprojects, and you do not need a build tool either, and build tools  come with their own standard way of organizing a project. Let’s start with the smallest  Java project ever, which should print Hello World! to the console.   The HelloWorld! Project in IntelliJ IDEA  As a side note, you do not even need a project because you have JShell. Open a terminal   Command Prompt for Windows  and JShell, and enter the System.out.print "Hello  World!"  statement.  $  jshell    Welcome to JShell -- Version 11-ea    For an introduction type:  help intro  jshell> System.out.print "Hello World!"  Hello World!  Since you installed IntelliJ IDEA, let’s create a Java project and check what project   structure the editor chooses for us. Start with the first IntelliJ IDEA and click the Create  New Project option. A second dialog window appears on top with the types of projects  that you can create listed on the left. The two dialog windows mentioned here are  depicted in Figure 3-9.  70   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-9.  Create an IntelliJ IDEA project  Select Java project type from the left and click Next.  Do not select any of the   additional libraries and frameworks, we are actually creating the smallest Java project  possible.  In the next dialog window, the project name and location can be introduced.  As we are creating a Java 11 project, you can notice at the bottom a section used to  configure the Java module. This configuration window is depicted in Figure 3-10.  71   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-10.  IntelliJ IDEA project configuration dialog window  After inserting the project and module name- we used sandbox for both project   name and module name- click Finish and the next window should be the editor  window, in which you can start writing code. If you expand the sandbox node on the left   that section is called the project view , you can see that the project is built using the JDK  you have installed  in this case 11  and a src directory was created for you. Your project  should look a lot like the one depicted in Figure 3-11.  Figure 3-11.  IntelliJ IDEA project view  72   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Before writing code, let’s check out what other project settings are available. IntelliJ  IDEA provides you access to view and edit project properties through the File ➤ Project  Structure... menu item. If you click it, a dialog window opens, similar to the one  depicted in Figure 3-12.  Figure 3-12.  IntelliJ IDEA project settings tab  By default, the Project settings tab is opened. In Figure 3-12, there are two arrows   attracting your attention to the Project SDK: section, which is depicting the JDK version  for a Java project, and the Project language level: section. At the time this chapter was  written, JDK 11 EA was the most recent version. The most recent version of IntelliJ IDEA  supports syntax and code completion for Java 11, which is why it is depicted here. This is  the meaning of the project language level setting.  If you switch to the tab named Modules you see the information depicted in Figure 3-13.  73   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-13.  IntelliJ IDEA modules settings tab  !  Let’s clarify something first. the Modules tab does not show information  about Java modules in your project. aside from Java modules, that wrap packages  together; a module is also a way to wrap up Java sources and resource files  with a common purpose within a project. that is why, before oracle introduced  the module concept to modularize Java applications, the code making up these  applications was already modularized by developers that needed to structure big  projects in some practical way.  In the Modules tab, you can see the number of parts  modules  that a project has and   the settings for each part. The sandbox has one part: one module named also sandbox  and the source for this module is contained in the src directory. So, if we want to write a  class that prints Hello World!, the file called HelloWorld.java must be placed under it. If  you right-click the src directory, the menu depicted in Figure 3-14 appears.  74   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-14.  IntelliJ IDEA menu listing which Java objects can be created in the  src directory  Aside from the Java Class option, there are a few red arrows showing you what other   components can be in the src directory. Let’s go ahead and create our class. Click the  Java Class menu option, and after introducing the class name, expand the Kind: drop-  down list. Figure 3-15 shows the expanded list.  Figure 3-15.  IntelliJ IDEA dialog windows to create a Java data type  75   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  The core building block of a Java application is the Java class, but there are other   object types in Java. In the Kind: list, the four Java object types are listed. Each of them  is explained in detail later; for now, select Class and click the OK button. You notice that  a file named HelloWorld.java was created under the src directory and the contents of  that file are quite simple.   **  * Created on 3 3 18.  *  public class HelloWorld {  }  You have created your first Java class in your first simple Java project. It does   nothing yet. But it can be compiled by selecting from the IntelliJ IDEA Build menu, the  Build Project option, or by pressing a combination of keys, that is different for each  operation system. Compiling the Build Project option produce the HelloWorld.class  file, containing the bytecode. By default, IntelliJ IDEA stores compilation results into a  directory named out\production. The menu option for compiling your project and the  result are depicted in Figure 3-16. The menu option is marked with  1 .  76   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-16.  IntelliJ IDEA—how to compile a Java project  When you have more classes in your project, you can compile the one you modify by  right-clicking the class body and choosing Recompile [ClassName].java, marked with  2   in Figure 3-16.  It is time we make the class print Hello World!. For that we need to add a special   method to the class. Any Java desktop application has a special method named main that  has to be declared in a top-level class. This method is called by the JRE to run the Java  program application and I call it the entry point. Without such a method, a Java project  is a collection of classes that are not runnable, cannot be executed, and cannot perform  certain functions. Imagine it this way: it’s like having a car, but you have no way of  starting it, because the ignition lock cylinder is missing. By for all intents and purposes,    77   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  it is a car, but it cannot perform the main purpose of a car, which is to take you somewhere.  You can imagine the main method as the ignition lock cylinder, where the JRE inserts the  key to get your application running. Let’s add that method to the HelloWorld class.18   **  * Created on 3 3 18.  *  public class HelloWorld {      public static void main String... args  {         System.out.println "Hello  World!" ;     } }  Now, let’s run this class. In IntelliJ IDEA, you have also two options: from the Run  menu choose the Run '[ClassName]' option, or right-click the class body and select  Run '[ClassName]'.main   from the menu that appears.19  Figure 3-17, depicts the menu items that you can use to execute the class, as well as   the result of the execution.  18 Because IntelliJ IDEA is an awesome editor, you can generate the main method, by typing psvm   and pressing the Tab key.  19 Next to the Run menu item, a combination of keys is depicted that can be used to run the class.  78   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-17.  IntelliJ IDEA—how to execute a Java class  So, this is the most basic structure for a Java Project. This project is so simple that it   can also be compiled manually from the command line. So, let’s do that.   The HelloWorld! Project Compiled and Executed Manually  You’ve probably noticed the Terminal button in your IntelliJ IDEA. If you click that  button, inside the editor a terminal window will be opened. For Windows it is a  Command Prompt instance, for Linux and macOS are the default shell. And IntelliJ open  your terminal right into your project root. The following explains what you have to do.    1.  Enter the src directory by executing the following command:  cd src  cd is a command that works in Windows and Unix systems and is   short for change directory.    2.  Compile the HelloWorld.java file by executing:  javac HelloWorld.java  79   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  javac is a JDK executable used to compile Java files that IntelliJ IDEA  calls in the background.    3.  Run the resulting bytecode from the HelloWorld.class file by   executing:  java HelloWorld  Figure 3-18 depicts the execution of those commands in a terminal in IntelliJ IDEA.  Figure 3-18.  Manually compile and run the HelloWorld class in a terminal inside  IntelliJ IDEA  Looks simple, right? And it actually is simple, because no packages or Java modules   were defined. But wait, is that possible? Well, yes. If you did not define a package, the  class is still part of an unnamed default package that is provided by default by the JSE  platform for the development of small, temporary, and educational applications like the  one you are building. So, let’s make our project a little bit more complicated and add a  named package for our class to be in.  80   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet   Putting the HelloWorld Class in a Package  In Figure 3-14, there is a Package option in the menu. So right-click the src directory  and select it. A dialog window appears where you must enter the package name. Enter  com.sandbox. Figure 3-19 shows the dialog windows. Even though the package was  already created, I introduced the same name again to show how the IDE warns that you  are trying to create a package with the same name.  Figure 3-19.  Create package in IntelliJ IDEA  So, we created the package, but the class is not in it. Well, the way to get it there, is  to select it and drag it into it. A dialog window for moving the class appear, because the  editor must modify the class to make it to belong to the package by adding a package  statement. And it requires your approval for the operation. Figure 3-20 depicts this dialog  window.  81   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-20.  Moving a class into a package in IntelliJ IDEA  Click the Refactor button and look at what happens to the class. The class should  now start with a package com.sandbox; declaration. If you rebuild your project, and  then look at the directory structure, you see something similar to what is depicted in  Figure 3-21.  Figure 3-21.  New directory structure after adding the com.sandbox package  82   If you compile and execute the class manually, you must consider the package now,   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  so your commands change to  ~ sandbox src:  $ javac com sandbox HelloWorld.java ~ sandbox src:  $ java com sandbox HelloWorld Hello World!  But things do not end here, because we still have Java modules. So, what about   that? How is our code running without a module-info.java file? Well, there is a  default unnamed module, and all JARs, modular or not, and classes on the classpath  are contained in it. This default and unnamed module exports all packages and reads  all other modules. Because it does not have a name it cannot be required and read by  named application modules. Thus, even if your small project seems to work with JDKs  in versions 9 and higher, it cannot be accessed by other modules; but it works because it  can access others.  This ensures backward compatibility with older versions of the JDK,  but depending on the complexity of the project, compatibility is not always ensured.   This being said, let’s add a module to our project.   Configuring the com.sandbox Module  Configuring a module is as easy as adding a module-info.java file under the src directory.  In Figure 3-14, in the menu listed there is a module-info.java option and if you select  that, the IDE generates the file for you. All is well and fine, and if you do not like the  module name that was generated for you, you can change it. I changed it to com.sandbox  to respect the module naming convention established by Oracle developers.   **  * Created on 3 3 18. *  module com.sandbox {  }  What happens now that we have a module? Not much from the IDEs point of view.   But if you want to compile a module manually, you have to know a few things. I compiled  our module using the following command:  ~ sandbox src : $ javac -d .. out com.sandbox \         module-info.java    \         com sandbox HelloWorld.java  83   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  !  "\" is a macoS Linux separator. on Windows, either write the whole command  on a single line or replace "\" with "^".  Let me explain what I did there. The syntax to compile a module is this:  javac -d [destination location] [module name] \     [source  location] module-info.java  \     [java files...]  The result of executing that command is that a directory named com.sandbox in the   out directory is created—the module name. Under this directory, we have the normal  structure of the com.sandbox package. The contents of the out directory are depicted in  Figure 3-22.  Figure 3-22.  Java module com.sandbox compiled manually  As you have noticed in this example, the module does not really exist until we   compile the sources, because a Java module is more of a logical mode of encapsulating  packages described by the module-info.class descriptor. The only reason the com. sandbox directory was created is that we specified it as argument in the javac -d  command.  We have a compiled module, what do we do with it? We try to run the application   sandbox : $ java --module-path out \       --module   com.sandbox com.sandbox.HelloWorld Hello  World!  obviously.  84   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  The syntax to execute a modular application is this:  java --module-path [destination location] \    --module [module name]  [package name].HelloWorld Hello  World!  Regarding the module name, doesn’t it seem a little redundant? To me it sure looks  like it, which is why I prefer not to create directories for modules unless I have more of  them under the src directory. And we must talk about the standard naming conventions  for modules. That is also another thing that might give developer headaches if they  want to create directories for modules. In multiple blog articles and Oracle Magazine   September 2017 , this is recommended.20 But do not worry about it for now; the book’s  sources contain modules with simple names, and the module configuration is already in  place for you.   Java Projects Using Build Tools  Mostly Gradle   Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Although Gradle is  gaining ground, Maven is still one of the most used build tools. Tools like Gradle and  Maven are used to organize the source code of an application in interdependent project  modules and configure a way to compile, validate, generate sources, test, and generate  artifacts automatically. An artifact is a file, usually a JAR, that gets deployed to a Maven  repository. A Maven repository is a location on an HDD where JARs are saved in a special  directory structure.  The discussion about build tools must start with Maven, because this build tool   standardized a lot of the terms we used in development today. Gradle respects a lot of  Maven standard rules was chosen as the go-to build tool for the sources attached to this  book, because it is easier to configure and the configuration files are reduced in size. A  project split into multiple subprojects can be downloaded from GitHub, and built in the  command line or imported into IntelliJ. This approach makes sure that you get quality  sources that can be compiled at once. It is also practical, because I imagine you do not  want to load a new project in IntelliJ IDEA every time you start reading a new chapter.  Also, it makes it easier for me to maintain the sources and adapt them to a new JDK, and  with Oracle releasing so often, I need to be able to do this quickly.  20 Oracle Magazine from September 2017 can be accessed at http:  www.javamagazine.  mozaicreader.com SeptOct2017&pageSet=29&page=0  85   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  The project you use to test the code written in this book and write your own code   if you want to, is called java-for-absolute-beginners. It is a multimodule Gradle  project. The first level of the project is the java-for-absolute-beginners project, that  has a configuration file named build.gradle. In this file, all dependencies and their  versions are listed. The child projects, the ones on the second level, are the modules of  this project. And we call them child projects because they inherit those dependencies  and modules from the parent project. In their configuration files, we can specify which  dependencies are needed from the list defined in the parent. And these modules are  a method of wrapping up sources for each chapter and that is why these modules are  named chapter00, chapter01, and so forth. If a project is big and needs a lot of code to  be written, the code is split again in another level of modules. Module chapter05 is such  a case, and is configured as a parent for the projects underneath it. In Figure 3-23, you see  what this project looks like loaded in IntelliJ IDEA, and module chapter05 is expanded  so you can see the third level of modules. Each level is marked with the corresponding  number.  86   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-23.  Gradle multimodule-level structure  87   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  In the Appendix you can read a detailed explanation for the configuration of this  Gradle project. For now, if you have loaded it into IntelliJ IDEA as you were taught in  Chapter 2, you can make sure everything is working correctly by building it. Here’s how  you do it.  You can do it by using the IntelliJ IDEA editor, in the upper right side you should   have a tab called Gradle projects.  If the projects are loaded as they are depicted in Figure 3-24, the project was loaded   correctly. If the Gradle projects tab is not visible, look for a label like the one marked  with  1 , and click it.  Figure 3-24.  Gradle multimodule-level structure  88   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Expand the java-for-absolute-beginners root  node until you find the build  task, marked with  2 . If you double click it and in the view at the bottom of the editor  you do not see any error, all your projects were built successfully.  The second way to make sure the Gradle project is working as expected is to build  it from the command line. Open an IntelliJ IDEA terminal, and if you installed Gradle  on the system path as explained in Chapter 2, enter gradle clean build and hit the  Enter key. In the command line, you might see some warnings, if the Gradle plugin for  supporting Java modules is still unstable when this book reaches you, but as long as the  execution ends with BUILD SUCCESSFUL, everything is alright.  Aside from the sandbox project, all the classes, modules, and packages mentioned  in this section are part of this project. chapter00 and chapter01 do not really contain  classes specific to those chapters. I needed them to construct the Java module examples.  IntelliJ IDEA sorts modules in alphabetical order, so the naming of the chapter modules  was chosen this way. They are listed in the order that you should work with them. Until  now, this chapter was focused on the building blocks of Java applications, and you  created a class that prints Hello World! by following the instructions, but the details were  not really covered. Let’s do that now and enrich the class with new details.   Explaining and Enriching the Hello World! Class We wrote a class named HelloWorld in our sandbox project. I propose you to add that  class to the chapter03 module. Just copy it or create it under the com.apress.bgn.ch3. helloworld package, and let’s analyze it first and then see what more can we do with it.  In Figure 3-25, the class is depicted in the IntelliJ IDEA editor, and a few details about the  IDE are underlined. Let’s talk about the class first.  89   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Figure 3-25.  Adding HelloWorld to the java-for-absolute-beginners project  The following explains the lines that contain different statements.  the package declaration: When classes are part of a package their  code must start with this line that declares the package the class is  part of. The package is a reserved keyword in Java and cannot be used  for anything else but declaring a package.        left empty so the picture looks nicer   the class declaration: This is the line where we declare our class;  it is public so it can be seen from everywhere; it is a class named  HelloWorld. The body of a class is enclosed between curly brackets,  and the opening bracket is on this line as well.  the main   method declaration: In Java, a method signature is the  method name and the number, type, and order of its parameters.  A method also has a return type, as in the type of result it returns.  But there is also a special type that can declare methods that do not  return anything. In order of appearance, the following explains what  every term of the main   method represents.              90   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet     public: A method accessor; the main method must be public;   otherwise, JRE can’t access it and call it.          static: When an object of that class type is created, it has the fields  and methods as declared by the class. The class is a template  for creating objects. Because of the static keyword, the main  method is not associated with an object of a class type, but with  the class itself. More information about this in Chapter 4.  void: This keyword is used here to tell us that the main method  does not return anything, so it’s like a replacement for "no type",  because if nothing is returned there is no need for a type.     String[] args: Methods are sometimes declared as receiving  some input data, String[] args represents an array of text  values.  Arrays are sets of data of fixed length; in mathematics  they are known as a one-dimension matrix or vector.  String  is the class representing text objects in Java. The [] means array  and args is its name. But wait, we’ve run this method before and  we did not need to provide anything! Well, it is not mandatory,  but you’ll see how you can give it arguments  values provided to  the method, which are used by the code in its body  after this list.  in previous code samples, you might have noticed that the main method was   !  written like this:  public class HelloWorld {  public static void main String... args  { System.out.println "Hello  World!" ;  }  }  the three dots are referred to as varargs and allow you to pass more than one  string to the method. it’s an alternative way of writing this method and it is used   in the book when the sources require some special formatting that involves [].      {: The starting bracket of the main   method body.        left empty so the picture looks nicer .  91   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet     System.out.println "Hello World!" ;: A statement used for writing   Hello World in the console.          }: The closing bracket of the main   method body.  }: The closing bracket for the class body.  If we execute this class, Hello World! gets printed in the console. Figure 3-17 shows   how to execute a class with a main   method in it. After executing a class that way, IntelliJ  IDEA automatically saves the configuration for that execution in a run configuration and  displays it in a drop-down list next to a triangular green button that executes that class  by clicking it. Both are placed on the IDE header and ostentatiously pointed to you in  Figure 3-25. Those two elements are really important because a run configuration can be  edited and added arguments for the JVM and the main   method. Let’s first modify the  main   method to do something with the arguments.  package com.apress.bgn.ch3.helloworld;  public class HelloWorld {     public  static  void  main String[]  args   {         System.out.println "Hello  " +  args[0]  +  "!" ;     } }  !  arrays are accessed using indexes of their elements, and the counting starts  in Java from 0. Consequently, the first member of an array can be found at 0, the  second at 1 and so on. But arrays can be empty, so in the previous code snippet, if  no argument is specified, the execution of the program crash and in the console an  explicit message are printed in red.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0  at  chapter.three com.apress.bgn.ch3.helloworld.HelloWorld. main HelloWorld.java:5   When we try to access an empty array, or an element of an array that  does not exist, Java programs crash and the JVM throws an object of type  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException containing the line where the failure  happened and the index of the element we were trying to access. exception   92   objects are used by the JVM to notify developers of exceptional situations when a  Java execution does not work as expected and these objects contain information  on where in the code it happened and what caused the problem.  Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  The modification we did in the previous code snippet prints the text value provided  as argument when executing the class. Let’s modify the run configuration for this class  and add an argument. If you click the small gray arrow next to the Run configuration  name, a menu appears. Click Edit Configurations... and inspect the dialog window  shown in Figure 3-26 .  Figure 3-26.  Customizing a Run configuration  93   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  In the image, the key elements were circled  well, enclosed in a rectangle actually,   but you get the idea! . As you can see in the run configurations list in Figure 3-26, IntelliJ  IDEA saves a few of your previous executions, including the Gradle build task, that you  executed earlier in this chapter. In the left of the Run Debug Configurations dialog  windows, you can see the IntelliJ IDEA run configurations grouped by type. By default,  the last run configuration is opened on the right of the window, in this case it should  be the run configuration for the HelloWorld class. There are a lot of options you can  configure for an execution and most of them have been automatically decided by the  IDE. The Program arguments: text field is where your arguments for the main   method  are introduced. In Figure 3-26, I introduced Developer. So, if you click the Apply button  and then the OK button, and then execute the class, instead of Hello World! you should  see now Hello Developer! in the console.  So what else can we do with our class? Remember the code the book started with?   Let’s put it in the main main   method.  package com.apress.bgn.ch3.helloworld;  import   java.util.List;  public class HelloWorld {      public static void main String... args  {         List  items = List.of "1", "a", "2", "a", "3", "a" ;         items.forEach item -> {             if  item.equals "a"   {                 System.out.println "A" ;             } else {                 System.out.println "Not A" ;             }         } ;     } }  The import java.util.List; statement is the only type of statement that can exist  between a package and a class declaration. This statement is telling the Java compiler  that object type java.util.List is used in the program. The import keyword is followed  by the fully qualified name of the data type. A fully qualified name of a data type is  made of the package name java.util , a dot .  and the simple name of the class List .   94   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet  Without it, the class will not compile. Try it; just put    in front of the statement, which  turns the line into a comment that is ignored by the compiler. You will see the editor  complaining by making any piece of code related to that list bright red.  The statement List  items = List.of "1", "a", "2", "a", "3", "a" ;    creates a list of text values21,22 that are then traversed, one by one, by the forEach  method, and each of them are tested to see if they are equal to the "a" character.23  If you run the class now, you should see a sequence of A and Not A in the console,   each on its own line.  Not  A A Not  A A Not  A A  The code we have written until now uses a few types of objects to print a simple   message in the console. The List object is used to hold a few String objects. The  messages are printed using the println   method, that is called on the out object, that  is a static field in the System class. And these are just the objects that are visible to you in  the code. Under the hood, the List objects are processed by a Consumer object created  on the spot that the lambda expression hides for simplicity.  package com.apress.bgn.ch3.helloworld;  import java.util.List; [import  java.util.function.Consumer;]  public class HelloWorld {     public static void main String... args  {         List  items = List.of "1", "a", "2", "a", "3", "a" ;         items.forEach new Consumer    {             @Override  21 Creating lists this way was introduced in Java 9 22 Specifying what type of elements are in a list by using   was introduced in Java 5 and it’s called   generics  23 The whole expression used to do this is called a lambda expression. This type of syntax was   introduced in Java 8, together with the forEach method.  95   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet              public void accept String item  {                 if  item.equals "a"   {                     System.out.println "A" ;                 } else {                     System.out.println "Not A" ;                 }             }         } ;     } }  It might look scary now, but I promise that this book introduces each concept in  a clear context and compared with real life objects and events so you can understand  it easily. And if that does not work, there are always more books, more blogs, and the  official Oracle webpage for each JDK, which have good tutorials. Where there’s a will,  there’s a way.  !  also, use your iDe! By clicking any object type in the code while pressing the  Control Command key, the code of the object class is opened, and you can see  how that class was written and you can read the documentation for it directly in  the editor. as an exercise do this for the forEach method and the System class.   Summary In this chapter, you did the following tasks:     Learned how to use JShell     Learned about Java packages and actually created one     Learned about Java accessors     Learned about modules     Created our first Java project with IntelliJ IDEA     Wrote the code for our first program within IntelliJ IDEA      ... that we later compiled manually too  96   Chapter 3    GettinG Your Feet Wet     Ran our first program  Hello World!      Added packages to it     Configured a module for it      ... and compiled and executed it manually too     Learned about Gradle and how it can make a developer’s life easy  Many of the things you did in this chapter, you will probably do daily after getting  a job as a Java developer—except for the time you’ll spend hunting and fixing bugs in  existing code. You will probably spend a lot of time reading documentation too, because  the JDK has a lot of classes, fields, and methods that you can use to write an application.  And with each released version, things change and you must keep yourself up-to-date.  Brains have limited capacity, so no employer should ever expect you to know every JDK  class and method; but work smart and keep the webpage24 at https:  docs.oracle. com javase 10 docs api  open in your browser. And when you have doubts about a  JDK class or method, you can read about it on the spot.  24 Currently, only the JDK 10 is available at https:  docs.oracle.com javase 10   97   CHAPTER 4  Java Syntax  Languages are means of communication—verbal or written—between people. Whether  they are natural or artificial, they are made of terms and have rules on how to use  them to perform the task of communication. Programming languages are means of  communicating with a computer. The communication with a computer is a written  communication; basically, the developer defines some instructions to be executed,  communicates them through an intermediary to the computer, and if the computer  understands them, performs the set of actions, and depending on the application type,  some sort of reply is returned to the developer.  In the Java language, communication is done through an intermediary—the   Java virtual machine. The set of programming rules that define how terms should be  connected to produce an understandable unit of communication is called syntax. Java  borrowed most of its syntax from a programming language called C++, which has a  syntax based on the C language. C syntax borrows elements and rules from languages  that preceded it, but in essence, all of these languages are based on the natural English  language.  Maybe Java got a little cryptic in version 8 because of the introduction of lambda   expressions, but when writing a Java program, if you are naming your terms properly in  the English language, the result should be code that is easily readable, like a story. A few details were covered in Chapter 3; packages and modules were covered   enough to give you a solid understanding of their purpose to avoid confusion with the  organization of the project and aimless fumbling through the code. But as expected  when it comes to actual code writing, the surface has been barely scratched. Thus, let’s  begin our deep dive into Java.    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_4  99   Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Base Rules of Writing Java Code Before writing Java code, let’s go over a few rules that you should follow to make sure  your code actually works. Let’s depict the class we ended Chapter 3 with by adding a few  details.  01.  package com.apress.bgn.ch3.helloworld; 02. 03.  import java.util.List; 04. 05.   ** 06.  * this is a JavaDoc comment 07.  *  08.  public class HelloWorld { 09.     public static void main String... args  { 10.            this is a one-line comment 11.

System.out.println "A" ; 18.              } else { 19.                 System.out.println "Not A" ; 20.              } 21.         } ; 22.     } 23.  }  Next, I’ll cover each rule in its own section.  100   Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Package Declaration A Java file always starts with the package declaration. The package name can contain  letters and numbers, separated by dots. Each part matches a directory in the path to  the classes contained in it. The package declaration should reveal the name of the  application and the purpose of the classes in the package. Let’s take the package naming  used for the sources of this book: com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic. If we split the package  name in pieces, the meaning of each piece is described as follows.                  com.apress is the domain of the application, or who owns the  application in this case  bgn is the scope of the code, in this case the book it is written for  Java  for Absolute Beginners   ch4 is the purpose of the classes in Chapter 4  basic is a more refined level of the purpose for the classes, these  classes are simple, used to depict basic Java notions   Import Section The import section follows the package declaration. This section contains the fully  qualified names of all classes, interfaces, and enums used within the file. Look at the  following code sample.  package java.lang;  import java.io.Serializable; import java.io.ObjectStreamField; import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException; import java.lang.annotation.Native; import java.nio.charset.Charset; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.Comparator; import java.util.Formatter; import java.util.Locale; ...  101   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  public final class String     implements Serializable, Comparable , CharSequence {      private  static  final  ObjectStreamField  serialPersistentFields  =         new ObjectStreamField0;     ... }  It is a snippet from the official Java String class. Every import statement makes  reference to the package and the name of a class used within the String class body.  Special import statements import static variables and static methods. Static variables   and methods can be used without the need to instantiate a class. In the JDK, there is a  class used for mathematical processes. It contains static variables and methods that can  be used by developers to implement code that solves mathematical problems. Look at  the following code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  import static java.lang.Math.PI;  import static java.lang.Math.sqrt;  public class Sample extends Object {     public static void main String... args  {         System.out.println "PI value =" + PI ;          double result = sqrt 5.0 ;          System.out.println "SQRT value =" + result ;     } }  By putting import and static together, we can declare a fully qualified name of a   class and the method or the variable we are interested in using in the code. This allows  us to use the variable or method directly, without the name of the class it is declared in.  Without the static imports, the code has to be rewritten like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  import  java.lang.Math;  public class Sample extends Object {  102   Chapter 4    Java Syntax      public static void main String... args   {         System.out.println "PI value =" + Math.PI ;          double result = Math.sqrt 5.0 ;          System.out.println "SQRT value =" + result ;     } }  Another thing that you probably do when writing Java code is to compact import  statements. Compacting imports is recommended when using multiple classes from  the same package to write code, or multiple static variables and methods from the same  class. When doing so, the import section of a file becomes really big and difficult to  read. This is where compacting comes to help. Compacting imports means replacing  all classes from the same package or variables and methods from the same class with a  wildcard so only one import statement is needed. So, the Sample class becomes  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  import static java.lang.Math.*;  public class Sample extends Object {     public static void main String... args  {         System.out.println "PI value  =" + PI ;          double result = sqrt 5.0 ;          System.out.println "SQRT value =" + result ;     } }   Java “Grammar” Java is case sensitive, which means that you can write a piece of code as follows.  public class Sample {      public static void main String... args  {         int mynumber = 0;         int myNumber = 1;  103   Chapter 4    Java Syntax          int Mynumber = 2;         int MYNUMBER = 3;         System.out.println mynumber ;         System.out.println myNumber ;         System.out.println Mynumber ;         System.out.println MYNUMBER ;     } }  All four variables are different and the last lines print numbers: 0 1 2 3. You cannot   declare two variables sharing the same name, in the same context  e.g., in the body of  a method , because you would be basically redeclaring the same variable and the Java  compiler does not allow this. If you try to do this, your code will not compile, and even  IntelliJ IDEA will try to make you see the error of your ways by underlining the code in  red and showing you a relevant message, like in Figure 4-1, where the mynumber variable  is declared twice.  Figure 4-1.  Same statements example with error  There is a set of Java keywords that can be used only for a fixed and predefined   purpose in the Java code. A few of them have already been introduced: import, package,  public, class. The rest of them are covered at the end of the chapter with a short  explanation for each  see Tables 4-2 and 4-3 .  104   Except for import, package, interface  or @interface , enum and class declarations,   everything else in a Java source file must be declared between curly brackets  {} . These  are called block delimiters. Take a look at the beginning of section 4.1. The brackets are  used there to wrap up the following.  Chapter 4    Java Syntax          contents of a class, also called the body of the class  brackets in lines  08 and 23   contents of a method, also called the body of a method  brackets in  lines 09 and 22       a set of instructions to be executed together  brackets in lines 12 and 21   Line terminators: code lines are usually ended in Java by the semicolon  ;  symbol or   by the ASCII characters CR, LF, or CR LF. Colons are used to terminate fully functioning  statements, like the list declaration in line 11. If we have a really little monitor, and we  are forced to split that statement on two subsequent lines to keep the code readable,  the colon at its end tells the compiler that this statement that is correct only when taken  together. Take a look at Figure 4-2.  Figure 4-2.  Different statements samples  The declaration of a list in line 8 is equivalent to the one in lines 10 and 11. The  declaration in line 13 and 14 is intentionally written wrong—a colon is added in line  13, which ends the statement there; but that statement is not valid and the compiler  complains about it when you try to compile that class by printing an exception saying:  "Error: 13, 32  java: illegal start of expression". If the error message does  not seem to fit the example, think about it like this: the problem for the compiler is not   105   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  the wrongful termination of the statement, but that after the = symbol, the compiler  expects to find some sort of expression that produces the value for the badList variable,  but instead it finds nothing.   Java Identifiers An identifier is the name you give to an item in Java: a class, variable, method, and  so forth. Identifiers must respect a few rules to allow the code to compile and also  common-sense programming rules, called Java coding conventions. A few of them are  listed below:  an identifier cannot be one of the Java reserved words, or the code  will not compile  an identifier cannot be a boolean literal  true, false  or the null  literal , or the code will not compile      an identifier can be made of letters, numbers and any of _, $     developers should declare their identifiers following the Camel case   writing style, the practice of writing compound words or phrases such  that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins  with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation,  making sure each word or abbreviation in the middle of the identifier  name begins with a capital letter  e.g., StringBuilder, isAdult   A variable is a set of characters that can be associated with a value. It has a type. The  set of values that can be assigned to it are restricted to a certain interval group of values  or must follow a certain form defined by that type. For example, items declared in line 11  is a variable of type List.  In Java, there are three types of variables.  fields are variables defined in class bodies, outside of method bodies  and that do not have the keyword static in front of them  local variables are variables declared inside method bodies, they are  relevant only in that context  static variables are variables declared inside class bodies with the  have the keyword static in front of them. If they are declared as  public they are accessible globally.                      106   Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Java Comments Java comments refer to pieces of explanatory text that are not part of the code executed  and are ignored by the compiler. There are three ways to add comments within the code  in Java, depending on the characters used to declare them.             is used for single line comments  line 10    ** ... *  Javadoc comments, special comments that are exported  using special tools into the documentation of a project called Javadoc  API  lines 05 to 07        * ... *  used for multiline comments  lines 13 to 15    Java Object Types When introducing the Java building blocks in Chapter 3, only class was mentioned  to keep things simple. It was mentioned that there are other object types in Java. The  expression object type is not really accurate and in this section, things become clearer.  Classes are templates for creating objects. Creating an object based on a class  is called instantiation and the resulted object is referred to as an instance of that  class. Instances are called objects because by default any class written by a developer  implicitly extends class java.lang.Object if no other superclass is declared. So, the  following class declaration  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Sample { }  is equivalent to  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Sample extends Object { }  Also, notice how importing the java.lang package is not necessary, because the  Object class is the root class of the Java hierarchy, all classes  including arrays  must  have access to extend it. And thus, the java.lang package is implicitly imported as well.  107   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  But aside from classes, there are other template types that can be used for creating  objects in Java. The following sections introduce them and explain what they are used  for. But let’s do so in context.  Let’s create a family of templates for defining humans. Most Java tutorials use   templates for vehicles or geometrical shapes. I want to model something that anybody  can easily understand and relate to. The purpose of the following sections is to develop  Java templates that model different types of people. The only Java template that I’ve  explained so far is the class, so let’s continue with that.   Classes The operation through which instances are created is called instantiation. So, to  design a class that models a generic human, we should think about two things: human  characteristics and human actions. So, what do all humans have in common? Well, a lot,  but for the purpose of this section, let’s choose three generic attributes: a name, age, and  height. These attributes map in a Java class to variables called fields or properties.   Fields  So, our class looks like this  initially :  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Human {     String name;      int age;      float height; }  In the code sample, the fields have different types, depending on which values   should be associated with them. For example, name can be associated with a text value,  like "John", and text is represented in Java by the String type. The age can be associated  with numeric integer values, so is of type int. And for the purpose of this section, we’ve  considered that the height of a person is a rational number like 1.9, so we used the  special Java type for this kind of value: float.  108   So, now we have a class modelling some basic attributes of a human. How do we   use it? We need a main   method and we need to instantiate the class. In the next code  snippet, a human named John is created.  Chapter 4    Java Syntax  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class BasicHumanDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         Human human = new Human  ;         human.name = "John";         human.age = 40;         human.height  =  1.91f;     } }  To create a Human instance, we use the new keyword. Next, we call a special method   called a constructor. I’ve covered methods before, but this one is special.  Some  programmers do not even consider it a method.  The most obvious reason for that is  it wasn’t defined anywhere in the body of the Human class. So, where is it coming from?  Well, it’s a default constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler unless an  explicit one is declared. A class cannot exist without a constructor; otherwise, it cannot  be instantiated. That is why the compiler generates one if none was explicitly declared.  The default constructor, calls super   that invokes the Object no argument constructor  that initializes all fields with default values. This can be tested by the following example.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class BasicHumanDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         Human human = new Human  ;         System.out.println "name: " + human.name ;         System.out.println "age:  " +  human.age ;         System.out.println "height: " + human.height ;     } }  109   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  What do you think will happen when you run the previous code? If you think that   some default values  neutral  printed, you are absolutely right. The following is the  output of the previous code.  name: null age: 0 height: 0.0  The numeric variables were initialized with 0, and the String value was initialized   with null. The reason for that is that the numeric types are primitive data types and  String is an object data type. The String class is part of the java.lang package, which is  one of the predefined Java classes that creates objects of type String. It is a special data  type that represents text objects. We’ll go deeper into data types in the following chapter.   Class Variables  Aside attributes that are specific to each human in particular, all humans have  something in common: a lifespan, which is assumed to be 100 years. It would be  redundant to declare a field called lifespan, because it has to be associated with the same  value for all human instances. So, we declare a field using the static keyword in the  Human class, which has the same value for all Human instances and that is initialized only  once. And we can go one step further and make sure that value never changes during the  execution of the program by adding the final modifier in front of its declaration as well.  This way we created a special type of variable called a constant. The new Human class  looks like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      String name;      int age;      float height;  }  110   The LIFESPAN variable is also called a class variable, because it is not associated   with instances but with the class. This is clear in the following example.  Chapter 4    Java Syntax  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class BasicHumanDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         Human john = new Human  ;         john.name = "John";          Human jane = new Human  ;         jane.name = "Jane";          System.out.println "John’s lifespan = " + john.LIFESPAN ;         System.out.println "Jane’s lifespan = " + jane.LIFESPAN ;          System.out.println "Human lifespan = " + Human.LIFESPAN ;     } }  When the main   method of the preceding class is executed, the following is printed,   which proves everything that was mentioned before.  John's lifespan = 100 Jane's lifespan = 100 Human lifespan = 100   Encapsulating Data  The class we defined makes no use of access modifiers on the fields, which is not  acceptable. Java is known as an object-oriented programming language  OOP , and  thus, code written in Java must respect the principles of OOP. Respecting these coding  principles ensures that the written code is of good quality and totally aligns with the  fundamental Java style. One of the OOP principles is encapsulation. The encapsulation  principle refers to hiding of data implementation by restricting access to it using special  methods called accessors  getters  and mutators  setters .  111   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Basically, any field of a class should have private access, and access to it should be   controlled by methods that can be intercepted, tested, and tracked to see where they were  called. Getters and setters are a normal practice to have when working so objects that most  IDEs have a default options to generate them, including IntelliJ IDEA. Right- click inside  the class body and select the Generate option to see all possibilities and select Getters and  Setters to generate the methods for you. The menu is depicted in Figure 4-3.  After making the fields private, and generating the getters and setter the Human class   now looks like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;      private int age;      private float height;      public String getName   {         return name;     }      public void setName String name  {         this.name = name;     }      public int getAge   {         return age;     }      public void setAge int age  {         this.age = age;     }      public float getHeight   {         return height;     }  112        public void setHeight float height  {          this.height = height;     } }  Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Figure 4-3.  IntelliJ IDEA code generation menu. Generate... ➤ Getter and Setter  submenu  So, you may be wondering what this is. As the word says, it is a reference to the   current object. So, this.name is the value of the field name of the current object. Inside  the class body, this accesses fields for the current object, when there are parameters  in methods that have the same name. And as you can see, the setters and getters that  IntelliJ IDEA generates have parameters that are named the same as the fields.  Getters are the simplest methods declared without any parameter. They return the  value of the field they are associated with. Their naming convention uses the get prefix  and the name of the field they access, with the first letter uppercased.  113   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Setters are methods that return nothing. They declare as a parameter a variable with   the same type that needs to be associated to the field. Their names are made of the set  prefix and the name of the field they access, with its first letter uppercased. Figure 4-4  depicts the setter and getter for the name field.  Figure 4-4.  Setter and getter methods used for the name field  This means that when instantiating the Human class, we have to use the setters   to set the field values and the getters to access those values. Thus, our class  BasicHumanDemo becomes  package  com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class BasicHumanDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         Human human = new Human  ;         human.setName "John" ;         human.setAge 40 ;         human.setHeight 1.91f ;          System.out.println "name: " + human.getName   ;         System.out.println "age: " + human.getAge   ;         System.out.println "height: " + human.getHeight   ;     }  114   Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Methods  Since getters and setters are methods it is time to start the discussions about methods too.  A method is a block of code characterized by returned type, name, and parameters that  describes an action done by or on the object that makes use of the values of its fields and  or arguments provided. An abstract template of a Java method is depicted as follows.  [accessor] [returned type] [name] type1 param1, type2 param2, ... {     code  [ [maybe] return val] }  Let’s create a method for the Human class that computes and prints how much time a  human still has to live by making use of his age and the LIFESPAN constant. Because the  method does not return anything, the return type used is void, a special type that tells  the compiler that the method does not return anything and we have no return statement  in the method body.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;     private int age;     private float height;        **      * compute and prints time to live      *      public void computeAndPrintTtl  {         int ttl = LIFESPAN - this.age;         System.out.println "Time to live: " + ttl ;     }         ... }  115   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  !  there is a Java coding convention in the naming of constants that recommends  using only uppercase letters, underscores, and numbers.  The preceding method definition does not declare any parameters, so considering   we have a Human instance we can call the method like this:  And we expect it to print Time to live: 60, which actually happened. Now, let’s   modify the method to return the value instead of printing it.  Human human = new Human  ; human.setName "John" ; human.setAge 40 ; human.setHeight 1.91f ; human.computeAndPrintTtl  ;  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;     private int age;     private float height;       **      * @return time to live      *      public int getTimeToLive  {         int ttl = LIFESPAN - this.age;         return ttl;     }         ... }  116   Calling the method do nothing in this case, we have to modify the code to save the   returned value and print it.  Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Human human = new Human  ; human.setName "John" ; human.setAge 40 ; human.setHeight 1.91f ; int timeToLive = getTimeToLive  ; System.out.println "Time  to  live: " + timeToLive ;  Both methods introduced here declare no parameters, so they are called without  providing any arguments. We won’t cover methods with parameters, as the setters are  more than obvious. Let’s skip ahead.   Constructors  Now we’ve done it. We can no longer use human.name without the compiler complaining  about it. But still, it is annoying to call all of those setters to set the properties; something  should be done about that. Remember the implicit constructor? Well, let’s create an  explicit one that has parameters for each of the fields we are interested in.  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;     private int age;     private float height;      public Human String name, int age, float height  {         this.name = name;         this.age =  age;         this.height   =   height;     }     ... }  117   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  In the preceding example, you can see that the constructor does not include  a return statement, even if the result of calling a constructor is the creation of an  object. Constructors are different from methods in that way. By declaring an explicit  constructor, the default constructor is no longer generated. So, creating a Human instance  by calling the default constructor does not work anymore; the code no longer compiles  because the default constructor is no longer generated.  Human human = new Human  ;  To create a Human instance, we now have to call the new constructor and provide   proper arguments in place of the parameters, having the same types as declared.  Human human = new Human "John", 40, 1.91f ;  But what if we do not want to be forced to set all fields using this constructor? It’s   simple, we define another with only the parameters that we are interested in. Let’s define  a constructor that only sets the name and the age for a Human instance.  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;     private int age;     private float height;      public Human String name, int age  {         this.name = name;         this.age = age;     }      public Human String name, int age, float height  {         this.name = name;         this.age = age;         this.height = height;     }     ... }  118   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  And this is where we stumble upon an OOP principle called polymorphism. The  term is Greek and translates to one name, many forms. Polymorphism manifests itself  by having multiple methods all with the same name, but slightly different functionality.  There are two basic types of polymorphism: overriding, also called run-time  polymorphism, and overloading, which is referred to as compile-time polymorphism.  The second type of polymorphism applies to the preceding constructors, because we  have two of them, one with a different set of parameters that looks like it is an extension  of the simpler one.  So, we have some code duplication in the previous example, and there is a common   sense programming principle called DRY1  Don’t Repeat Yourself!  that the following  example clearly defies. So, let’s fix that by using the this keyword.  public class Human {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private  String  name;     private int age;     private float height;      public Human String name, int age  {         this.name = name;         this.age  =  age;     }      public Human String name, int age, float height  {         this name, age ;         this.height  =  height;     }     ... }  Yes, constructors can call each other by using this ... . So now, we can use both   constructors to create Human instances. If we use the one that does not set the height, the  height field is implicitly initialized with the default value for type float.  1 Also one of the clean coding principles; read more about it at https:  blog.goyello. com 2013 01 21  top-9-principles-clean-code   119   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Now, our class is generic; we could even say that it models a Human class in an   abstract way. If we were to try to model humans with certain skill sets or abilities, we  must enrich this class. Let’s say we want to model musicians and actors. This means we  need to create two new classes. The Musician class is depicted in the following; getters  and setters for the fields are skipped.  public class Musician {        static final int LIFESPAN = 100;        private String name;        private int age;        private float height;        private String musicSchool;        private  String  genre;        private List  songs;       ...  }  public class Actor {     static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;      private int age;      private float height;      private  String  actingSchool;      private List  films;     ... }  The Actor class is depicted next; getters and setters for the fields are also skipped.  There are more than a few common elements between the two classes. One of the   clean coding principles requires developers to avoid code redundancy. This can be done  by designing the classes by following two OOP principles: inheritance and abstraction.  120   Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Abstraction  Abstraction is an OOP principle that manages complexity. Abstraction decomposes  complex implementations and defines core parts that can be reused. In our case, common  fields of the Musician and Actor classes can be grouped in the Human class that we defined  earlier in the chapter. The Human class can be viewed as an abstraction, because any human  in this world is more than his name, age, and height. So, there is no need to create Human  instances, because a human is represented by something else, like passion, purpose, and  skill. A class that does not need to be instantiated, but groups together fields and methods  for other classes to inherit, or provide a concrete implementation for is modelled in Java by  an abstract class. Thus, we modify the Human class to make it abstract first. And since we  are abstracting this class, let’s make the LIFESPAN constant public so we can access it from  anywhere and make the getTimeToLive method abstract.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public abstract class Human {     public static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      private String name;     private int age;     private float height;      public Human String name, int age  {         this.name = name;         this.age  =  age;     }      public Human String name, int age, float height  {         this name, age ;         this.height  =  height;     }       **      * @return time to live      *      public abstract int getTimeToLive  ; ...    setters & getters for fields in this class }  121   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  An abstract method like getTimeToLive   is declared in the example; it is a   method missing the body. This means that within the Human class, there is no concrete  implementation for this method, only a skeleton—a template that extending classes  must provide a concrete implementation for.  Oh, but wait, we kept the constructors! Why did we do that if we are not allowed to  use them anymore? And we aren’t, because Figure 4-5 shows what IntelliJ IDEA does  with the BasicHumanDemo class Figure 4-5.  Figure 4-5.  Java compiler error when trying to instantiate an abstract class  We kept the constructors because they can help further abstracting behavior. The  Musician and Actor classes must be rewritten to extend the Human class. This is done  by using the extends keyword when declaring the class and specifying the class to be  extended, also called the parent class or superclass. The resulting class is called a  subclass. When extending a non-abstract class, the subclass inherits all the fields and  concrete methods declared in the superclass.  When extending an abstract class, the subclass must provide a concrete   implementation for all abstract methods, and must declare their own constructors,  which eventually make use of the constructors declared in the abstract class. These  constructors can be called by using the keyword super. The same goes for methods, but  not for fields, unless they have the proper access modifier.  122   Let’s see what the Musician class looks like when making use of abstraction and   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  inheritance.    package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  import java.util.List;  public class Musician extends Human {      private String musicSchool;      private String genre;      private List  songs;      public Musician String name, int age, float height,         String musicSchool, String genre  {         super name, age, height ;         this.musicSchool = musicSchool;         this.genre = genre;     }      public int getTimeToLive   {         return  LIFESPAN - getAge      2;     } ...    setters & getters for fields in this class }  The songs field was not used as a parameter in the constructor for simplicity reasons   here.  The Musician constructor calls the constructor in the superclass to set the properties   defined there. Also, notice the full implementation provided for the getTimeToLive    method.  The Actor class is rewritten in a similar manner. You find a proposal implementation   in the sources for the book, but try to write your own before looking in the com.apress. bgn.ch4.basic package.  Figure 4-6 shows the Human class hierarchy, as generated by IntelliJ IDEA.  123   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Figure 4-6.  UML diagram generated by IntelliJ IDEA  The UML diagram clearly shows the members of each class and the arrows point   to the superclass. UML diagrams are useful tools in designing class hierarchies and  defining logic of applications. If you want to read more about them and the many types  of UML diagrams that there are, you can do so at www.uml-diagrams.org.  After covering so much about classes and how to create objects, we need to cover   other Java important components that create even more detailed objects, which can then  be used to implement more complex applications. Our Human class is missing quite a few  attributes, like gender for example. A field that models the gender of a person can only  have values from a fixed set of values. It used to be two, but because we are living in a brave  new world that is fond of political correctness, we cannot limit the set of values for genders  to two; so we introduce a third, called UNDEFINED. This means that we must introduce a   124   new class to represent a gender that is limited to being instantiated three times. This would  be tricky to do with a typical class. So, in Java version 1.5, enums were introduced.  Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Enums The enum type is a special class type. It defines a special type of class that can only be  instantiated a fixed number of times. An enum declaration, groups all instances of that  enum. All of them are constants. So, the Gender enum can be defined as shown in the  following piece of code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public enum Gender {     FEMALE,     MALE,     UNDEFINED }  An enum cannot be instantiated externally. An enum is by default final, thus it cannot   be extended. Remember how by default every class in Java implicitly extends class  Object? Every enum in Java implicitly extends class java.lang.Enum  and in doing so,  every enum instance inherits special methods that are useful when handling enums. As an enum is a special type of class, it can have fields and a constructor that can   only be private, as enum instances cannot be created externally. The private modifier is  not needed explicitly, as the compiler knows what to do. Let’s modify our Gender enum  to add an integer field that is the numerical representation of each gender and a String  field that is the text representation.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public enum Gender {     FEMALE 1, "f" ,     MALE 2, "m"  ,     UNDEFINED 3, "u" ;      private int repr;     private String descr;  125   But wait, what would stop us from declaring setters and modifying the field values?   Well, nothing. If that is what you need to do you can do it. But this is not a good practice.  Enum instances, should be constant. So, what we can do is to not create setters, and make  sure the values of the fields never change by declaring them final. When we do so, the  only way the fields can be initialized is by calling the constructor, and since the constructor  cannot be called externally, the integrity of our data is ensured. So, our enum becomes  Chapter 4    Java Syntax      Gender int repr, String descr  {         this.repr = repr;         this.descr = descr;     }      public int getRepr   {         return repr;     }      public String getDescr   {         return descr;     } }  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public enum Gender {     FEMALE 1, "f" ,     MALE 2, "m"  ,     UNDEFINED 3, "u" ;      private final int repr;     private final String descr;      Gender int repr, String descr  {         this.repr = repr;         this.descr = descr;     }      public int getRepr   {         return repr;     }  126   Chapter 4    Java Syntax      public String getDescr   {         return descr;     } }  Methods can be added to enums, and each instance can override them. So, if we add   a method called getComment   to the Gender enum, every instance inherits it. But the  instance can override it. Let’s see what that looks like.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public enum Gender {     FEMALE 1, "f" ,     MALE 2, "m"  ,     UNDEFINED 3, "u" {         @Override         public String comment   {            return "to be decided later: " + getRepr   + ", " + getDescr  ;         }     };      private final int repr;     private final String descr;      Gender int repr, String descr  {         this.repr = repr;         this.descr = descr;     }      public int getRepr   {         return repr;     }      public String getDescr   {         return descr;     }      public String comment   {         return repr + ": " + descr;     } }  127   If we were to print the values returned by the comment   method for each instance,   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  we would see the following.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public class Sample extends Object {     public static void main String... args  {         System.out.println Gender.FEMALE.comment   ;            prints '1: f'         System.out.println Gender.MALE.comment   ;            prints '2: m'         System.out.println Gender.UNDEFINED.comment   ;           prints 'to be decided later: 3, u'     } }  We’re going to be playing with enums in future examples as well. Just remember that  whenever you need to limit the implementation of a class to a fixed number of instances,  enums are the tools for you. And now because we introduced enums, our Human class can  also have a field of type Gender.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.basic;  public abstract class Human {     public static final int LIFESPAN = 100;      protected String name;      protected int age;      protected float height;      private Gender gender;      public Human String name, int age, Gender gender  {         this.name = name;         this.age = age;         this.gender = gender;     }  128   Chapter 4    Java Syntax      public Human String name, int age, float height, Gender gender  {         this name, age, gender ;         this.height = height;     }     ... }  In previous sections, interfaces were mentioned as one of the Java tools used to   create objects. It is high time I expand the subject.   Interfaces One of the most common Java interview questions is, “What is the difference between  an interface and an abstract class?” This section provides you the most detailed answer  to that question. An interface is not a class, but it does help create classes. An interface  is fully abstract; it has no fields, only method definitions  skeletons . A class can  implement an interface, and unless the class is abstract, it is forced to provide concrete  implementations for them. Each method declared inside an interface is implicitly public  and abstract, because methods need to be abstract to force implementing classes to  provide implementations and are public, so classes have access to do so.  The only methods with concrete bodies in an interface are static methods and   starting with Java 8, default methods. The interfaces cannot be instantiated, they do not  have constructors.  Interfaces that declare no method definitions are called marker interfaces and have   the purpose to mark classes for specific purposes. The most renowned Java marker  interface is java.io.Serializable, which marks objects that can be serialized their  state can be saved to a binary file .  An interface can be declared in its own file as a top-level component, or nested inside  another component. There are two types of interfaces: normal interfaces and annotations.  The difference between abstract classes and interfaces, and when one or the other   should be used, becomes relevant in the context of inheritance. Java supports only  single inheritance. This means a class can only have one superclass. This might seem  like a limitation, but let’s consider a simple example. Let’s modify the previous hierarchy  and imagine a class called Performer that should extend the Musician and Actor classes.  If you need a real human that can be modelled by this class, think of David Duchovny, an  actor who recently got into music.  129   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Figure 4-7 shows the class hierarchy.  Figure 4-7.  Diamond class hierarchy  The hierarchy in Figure 4-7 introduces something called the diamond problem, and   the name is inspired by the shape formed by the relationships between classes. What is  actually wrong with the design? If both Musician and Actor extend Human, and inherit  all members from it, which member does Performer inherit and from where? Because it  cannot inherit members of the Human class twice - this would make this class useless and  invalid. So, what is the solution? As you probably imagine, given the title of this section:  interfaces.  What has to be done is to turn methods in classes Musician and Actor into method  skeletons and transform those classes into interfaces. The behavior from the Musician is  moved to a class called, let’s say Guitarist, which extends the Human class and implement  the Musician interface. For the Actor class, something similar can be done, but I’ll leave  that as an exercise for you. Some help is provided by the hierarchy shown in Figure 4-8.  Figure 4-8.  Java hierarchy with interfaces for Performer class  The Musician interface contains only method templates mapping what a musician  does. It does not go into detail to model how. The same goes for the Actor interface. In  the following code snippet, you can see the bodies of the two interfaces.     Musician.java package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  import java.util.List;  130   public interface Musician {     String getMusicSchool  ;     void setMusicSchool String musicSchool ;     List  getSongs  ;     void setSongs List  songs ;     String getGenre  ;     void setGenre String genre ; }      Actor package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  import java.util.List;  public interface Actor {     String getActingSchool  ;     void setActingSchool String actingSchool ;     List  getFilms  ;     void setFilms List  films ;     void addFilm String filmName ; }  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  import java.util.List;  public class Performer extends Human     implements Musician, Actor {      private String musicSchool;      private String genre;      private List  songs;      private String actingSchool;      private List  films;  Chapter 4    Java Syntax  131  The fields have been removed because they cannot be part of the interfaces; all that is   left are the method templates. The Performer class is depicted in the next code snippet.   Chapter 4    Java Syntax      public Performer String name, int age, float height, Gender gender  {         super name, age, height, gender ;     }      @Override     public int getTimeToLive   {         return  LIFESPAN - getAge      2;     }      public String getMusicSchool   {         return musicSchool;     }      public void setMusicSchool String musicSchool  {         this.musicSchool = musicSchool;     }      public List  getSongs   {         return songs;     }      public void setSongs List  songs  {         this.songs = songs;     }      public void addSong String song  {         this.songs.add song ;     }      public String getGenre   {         return genre;     }      public void setGenre String genre  {         this.genre = genre;     }      public String getActingSchool   {         return actingSchool;     }  132   Chapter 4    Java Syntax      public void setActingSchool String actingSchool  {         this.actingSchool = actingSchool;     }      public List  getFilms   {         return films;     }      public void setFilms List  films  {         this.films = films;     }      public void addFilm String filmName  {         this.films.add filmName ;     } }  What you are left with from this example is that using interfaces multiple   inheritance is possible in Java, and that classes extend classes and implement interfaces.  But inheritance applies to interfaces too. For example, both Musician and Actor  interface can extend an interface named Artist that contains template for behavior  common to both. For example, we can combine the music school and acting school  into a generic school and define the setters and getters for it as method templates. The  Artist interface is depicted as follows with Musician.      Artist.java package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  public interface Artist {     String getSchool  ;     void setSchool String chool ; }      Musician.java package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  import java.util.List;  133   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  public interface Musician extends Artist {      List  getSongs  ;     void setSongs List  songs ;     String getGenre  ;     void setGenre String genre ; }  Hopefully, you understood the idea of multiple inheritance, when it is appropriate   to use classes, and when to use interfaces in designing your applications. It is time to  fulfill the promise made in the beginning of this section and list the differences between  abstract classes and interfaces. You can find them in Table 4-1.  Table 4-1.  Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Java  Abstract Class  Interface  Can have non-abstract methods  Can only have abstract and  since Java 8  default methods, since Java 9 private methods   Single inheritance: a class can only extend one  class  Multiple inheritance: a class can implement  more than one interface.  Can have final, non-final, static and non-static  variables  Can only have static and final fields.  Declared with abstract class  Declared with interface.  Can extend another class using keyword  extends and implement interfaces with keyword  implements  Can have non-abstract, protected or private  members  Can only extend other interfaces  one or more   using key-word extends.  all members are method definitions and are  by default abstract and public.  except default  methods, starting with Java 8 and private  methods, starting with Java 9.   If a class has an abstract method, it must be  declared itself abstract   no correspondence   134   Chapter 4    Java Syntax   Default Methods One problem with interfaces is that if you modify their bodies to add new methods, most  likely, the code stops compiling because the classes implementing the interfaces do not  provide concrete implementations for the new methods declared in the interfaces. Sure,  a solution would be to declare the new methods in a new interface and then creating  new classes that implement both new and old interfaces.  The methods interfaces expose make up an API  application programming   interface  and when developing applications, the aim is to design applications and their  components to have a stable API. This rule is described in the open closed principle,  which is one of the five SOLID programming principles.2 This principle states that you  should be able to extend a class without modifying it. Thus, modifying the interface a  class implements, extends the class behavior, but only if the class is modified to provide  a concrete implementation for the new methods. So, implementing interfaces, tends to  lead to breaking this principle. So, how can we avoid this in Java?  In Java 8, a solution for this was finally introduced: default methods. Starting with   Java 8, methods with a full implementation can be declared in interfaces as long as they  are declared using the default keyword.  Let’s consider the previous example: the Artist interface. Any artist should be able  to create something, right? So, he or she should have a creative nature. Given the world  we are living in, I won’t mention names, but some of our artists are actually products of  the industry, so they are not creative themselves. So, the realization that we should have  a method that tells us if an artist has a creative nature or not, came way after we decided  our hierarchy, which is depicted in Figure 4-9.  Figure 4-9.  Java hierarchy with more interfaces for Performer class  2 A good article is at https:  hackernoon.com solid-principles-made-easy-67b1246bcdf  135   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  If we add a new method template to the Artist interface, the Performer class causes  a compile error. IntelliJ IDEA makes it clear that our application does not work anymore  by showing a lot of things in red, as depicted in Figure 4-10.  Figure 4-10.  Java broken hierarchy  The compiler errors that we see are caused by our decision to add a new method,   named isCreative, to the Artist interface. It is underlined in the following code  snippet.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  public interface Artist {     String getSchool  ;      void setSchool String school ;      boolean isCreative  ; }  136   To get rid of the compiling errors we’ll transform the isCreative method into a   default method that returns true, because every artist should be creative.  Chapter 4    Java Syntax  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy;  public interface Artist {     String getSchool  ;      void setSchool String school ;      default boolean isCreative  {         return true;     } }  Now, the code should compile again. If we need to add more than one default   method to an interface and the methods have some implementation in common,  that  code can be isolated starting with Java 9 into a private method that can be called from  the default methods.  So basically, starting from Java 9, full blown methods can be part of  an interface, as long as they are declared private.   Annotation Types  An annotation is defined in a similar way to an interface; the difference is that the  interface keyword is preceded by the at sign  @ . Annotation types are a form of  interfaces, and most times, they are used as markers. For example, you’ve probably  noticed the @Override annotation. This annotation is automatically placed by intelligent  IDEs when classes extending or implementing interfaces are generated automatically.  It’s declaration in the JDK is depicted in the following code snippet.  package java.lang;  import  java.lang.annotation.*;  @Target ElementType.METHOD  @Retention RetentionPolicy.SOURCE  public @interface Override {}  Annotations that do not declare any property are called marker or informative   annotations. They are needed only to inform other classes in the application, or   137   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  developers of the purpose of the components they are placed on. They are not  mandatory and the code compiles without them.  In Java 8, an annotation named @FunctionalInterface was introduced. This   annotation was placed on all Java interfaces that can be used in lambda expressions.   package java.lang;  import java.lang.annotation.*; @Documented @Retention RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME  @Target ElementType.TYPE  public @interface FunctionalInterface {}  Lambda expressions were also introduced in Java 8 and they represent a compact and   practical way of writing code that was borrowed from languages like Groovy and Ruby.  Functional Interfaces are interfaces that declare a single abstract method. Because   of this, the implementation of that method can be provided on the spot, without the  need to create a class to define a concrete implementation.  Let’s imagine the following scenario: we create an interface named Operation that   contains a single method.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.lambda;  @FunctionalInterface public interface Operation {     float execute int a, int b ; }  We’ll next create a class named Addition.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.lambda;  public class Addition implements Operation {      @Override     public float execute int a, int b  {         return a + b;     } }  138   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  And if we want to test it, we need yet another class.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.lambda;  public class OperationDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         Addition addition = new Addition  ;         float  result = addition.execute 2,5 ;         System.out.println "Result is " + result ;     } }  method call can be replaced with  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.lambda;  public class OperationDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         Operation addition2 =  a, b  -> a + b;         float result2 = addition2.execute 2, 5 ;         System.out.println "Lambda Result is " + result2 ;     } }  Using lambda, the Addition class is no longer needed, and the instantiation and the   Lambda expressions can be used for a lot of things. I’ll cover them throughout the   book, whenever code can be written in a more practical way using them.   Exceptions Exceptions are special Java classes that are used to intercept special unexpected  situations during the execution of a program so that the developer can implement the  proper course of action. These classes are organized in a hierarchy that is depicted in  Figure 4-11.  139   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Figure 4-11.  Java Exception hierarchy  Throwable is the superclass of all errors that can be thrown in a Java application. The  exceptional situations can be caused by hardware failures  e.g., trying to read a protected  file , by missing resources  e.g., trying to read a file that does not exist , or by bad code.  Bad developers tend to do this: when in doubt, catch a throwable. You should definitely  try to avoid this because the Error class that notifies the developer about a situation  that the system cannot recover from is a subclass of it. Let’s start with a simple example.  We define a method that calls itself  its technical name is recursive , but we’ll design it  badly to call itself forever and cause the JVM to run out of memory.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  public class ExceptionsDemo {         bad method     static int rec int i {         return rec i*i ;     }      public static void main String... args  {           rec 1000 ;         System.out.println "An error happened." ;     } }  If we run the class, An error happened is not printed. Instead, the program ends   abnormally by throwing a StackOverFlowError and states the line where the problem is   in our case, the line where the recursive method calls itself .  140   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StackOverflowError          at chapter.four com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex.ExceptionsDemo.           at chapter.four com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex.ExceptionsDemo.  recExceptionsDemo.java:7  recExceptionsDemo.java:7          ...  StackOverFlowError is a subclass of Error, and is caused by the defective recursive  method that was called. Sure, we could modify the code, treat this exceptional situation,  and execute whatever has to be executed next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  public class ExceptionsDemo { ...     public static void main String... args  {         try {             rec 1000 ;         } catch  Throwable r  {         }         System.out.println "An error happened." ;     } }  In the console, you see only the An error happened text, but no trace of the error,   which is why we caught it and decided not to print any information about it. This is also  a bad practice called exception swallowing, never do this! Also, the system should not  recover from this, as the result of any operation after an error is thrown is unreliable.  That is why, as a rule of thumb, never catch a throwable!!  The Exception class is the superclass of all exceptions that can be caught and  treated, and the system can recover from them. The RuntimeException class is the  superclass of exceptions that are thrown during the execution of the program, so the  possibility of them being thrown is not known when the code is written. Let’s consider  the following code sample.  141   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  public class ExceptionsDemo {      public static void  main String... args  {         Performer p = PerformerGenerator.get "John" ;          System.out.println "TTL: " + p.getTimeToLive   ;     } }  Let’s suppose we do not have access to the code of the PerformerGenerator class.   We know that if we call the get ..  method with a name, it returns a Performer  instance. So, we write the preceding code and try to print the performer time to live.  What happens if the performer is not initialized with a proper object, because the  get "John"  method call returns null? The outcome is depicted in the next code snippet.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException          at  chapter.four com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex.ExceptionsDemo.  mainExceptionsDemo.java:10  But if we are smart developers, or a little paranoid, we can prepare for this case,  catch the exception and throw an appropriate message or perform there a dummy  initialization, in case the performer instance is used in some other way later in the code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  public class ExceptionsDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         Performer p = null;  PerformerGenerator.get "John" ;         try {             System.out.println "TTL: " + p.getTimeToLive   ;         } catch  Exception e  {             System.out.println "The performer was not initialised properly                 because of: " + e.getMessage    ;         }     } } 142   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  The exception that was thrown is of type NullPointerException, a class that extends  RuntimeException, so a try catch block is not mandatory. This type of exceptions are  called unchecked exceptions, because the developer is not obligated to check for them.  The NullPointerException is the exception type Java beginner developers get a lot  because they do not have the "paranoia sense" developed enough to always test objects  with unknown origin before using them.  There is another type of exceptions that are called checked exceptions. This is any   type of exception that extends Exception—including custom exception classes declared  by the developer—that are declared as explicitly thrown by a method. In this case, when  invoking that method, the compiler forces the developer to treat that exception or throws  it forward. Let’s use a mock implementation for PerformerGenerator.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Gender; import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  public class PerformerGenerator {      public static Performer get String name            throws EmptyPerformerException {         return new Performer name,40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;     } }  java.lang.exception class.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  public class EmptyPerformerException extends Exception {     public EmptyPerformerException String message  {         super message ;     } }  The EmptyPerformerException is a simple custom exception class that extends the   We declared that the get ..  method might throw EmptyPerformerException; and   without a try catch block wrapping that method call a compiler error is thrown, as  depicted in Figure 4-12.  143   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  Figure 4-12.  Java compiler error caused by checked exception  How do we fix it? Well, we write the code to catch it and print a relevant message.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  public class ExceptionsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         try {             Performer p = PerformerGenerator.get "John" ;             System.out.println "TTL: " + p.getTimeToLive   ;         } catch  EmptyPerformerException e  {             System.out.println "Cannot use an empty performer                because of " + e.getMessage   ;         }     } }  And since we are talking about exceptions, the try catch block can be completed  with a finally block. The contents of the finally block are executed if the exception  is thrown further, or if the method returns normally. The only situation in which the  finally block is not executed is when the program ends in an error.  144   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.ex;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  public class ExceptionsDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         try {             Performer p = PerformerGenerator.get "John" ;             System.out.println "TTL: " +  p.getTimeToLive   ;         } catch  EmptyPerformerException e  {             System.out.println "Cannot use an empty performer!" ;         } finally {             System.out.println "All went as expected!" ;         }     } }  During this book, we write code that ends in exceptional situations, so we’ll have the   opportunity to expand the subject when your knowledge is a little more advanced.   Generics Until now we talked only of object types and java templates used for creating objects. But  what if we would need to design a class with functionality that applies to multiple types  of objects? Since every class in Java extends the Object class, we can create a class with  a method that receives a parameter of type Object, and in the method we can test the  object type. Take this for granted; it is covered later.  In Java 5, the possibility to use a type as parameter when creating an object was   introduced. The classes that are developed to process other classes are called generics.  When writing Java applications, you most likely need at some point to pair up values  of different types. The simplest version of a Pair class that can hold a pair of instances of  any type is listed in the following code snippet.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.gen; public class Pair  {          protected X  x;         protected Y  y;  145   Chapter 4    Java Syntax          private Pair X x, Y y  {                 this.x = x;                 this.y = y;         }          public X x   {                 return x;         }          public Y y   {                 return y;         }          public void x X x  {                 this.x = x;         }          public void y Y y  {                 this.y = y;         }          ...          public static   Pair  of X x, Y y  {                 return new Pair  x, y ;         }      @Override public String toString   {          return "Pair{" + x.toString   +", " + y.toString   + ’}’;     } }  Let’s test it! Let’s create a pair of Performer instances, a pair of a String and a   Performer instance, and a pair of Strings to check if this is possible. The toString  }  method is inherited from the Object class and overridden in the Pair class to print the  values of the fields.  package com.apress.bgn.ch4.gen;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Gender; import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  146   Chapter 4    Java Syntax  public class GenericsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         Performer john = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         Performer jane = new Performer "Jane", 34, 1.591f, Gender.FEMALE ;          Pair  performerPair = Pair.of john, jane ;         System.out.println performerPair ;          Pair  stringPair = Pair.of "John", "Jane" ;         System.out.println stringPair ;          Pair  spPair = Pair.of "John", john ;         System.out.println spPair ;          System.out.println "all good." ;     } }  If you execute the preceding class, you see something like the log depicted, as   follows.  Pair{com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer@1d057a39com.apress.bgn.ch4.                  hierarchy.Performer@26be92ad} Pair{JohnJane} Pair{Johncom.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer@1d057a39} all good.  The println method expects its argument to be a String instance, the toString     method is called on the object given if argument if the type is not String. If the toString  method was not overridden, the one from the Object class is called that returns the  fully qualified name of the object type and something called a hashcode, which is a  numerical representation of the object.

Interfaces could only contain method templates until Java version 8,  when default methods were introduced. And starting with Java 9 they  can contain full implemented methods as long as they are declared  private and are being called only from default methods.     Enums are special types of classes that can only be instantiated a   fixed number of times.  In Java, there is no multiple inheritance using classes.  Interfaces can extend other interfaces.  Java defines a fixed number of keywords, called reserved keywords,  which can be used only for a specific purposes. They are covered in  the previous section.  151   CHAPTER 5  Data Types  In Chapter 4, a lot of Java code was written, but when designing classes, only the  most simple data types were used: a few numeric ones and text. In the JDK, a lot of  data types are declared for a multitude of purposes: for modelling calendar dates,  for representing multiple types of numeric, for manipulating texts, collections, files,  database connections, and so forth. Aside from JDK, there are libraries created by  other parties that provide even more functionality. But the data types provided by the  JDK are fundamental ones, the bricks every Java application is built from. Of course,  depending on the type of application you are building, you might not need all of them.  For example, I’ve never had the occasion to use the java.util.logging.Logger class.  Most applications that I’ve worked on were already set up by a different team when I  came along, and they were using external libraries like Log4j or Logback, or logging  abstractions like Slf4j.  This section covers the basic Java data types that you need to write about 80% of any   Java application.   Stack and Heap Memory Java types can be split in two main categories: primitive and reference types. Java code  files are stored on the HDD, Java bytecode files as well. Java programs run on the JVM,  which is launched as a process by executing the java executable. During execution, all  data is stored in two different types of memory named: stack and heap that are allocated  for a program’s execution by the operating system.  The stack memory is used during execution  also referred to as at runtime  to store   method primitive local variables and references to objects stored in the heap. A stack  is also a data-structure represented by a list of values that can only be accessed at one     Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_5  153   Chapter 5    Data types  end, also called a LIFO order, which is an acronym for Last In, First Out. The name fits,  because every time a method gets called, a new block is created in the stack memory  to hold local variables of the method: primitives and references to other objects in the  method.1  Each JVM execution thread has its own stack memory, and its size can be specified   using JVM parameter -Xss. If too many variables are allocated, or the method being  called is recursive and badly designed, the condition to return is never fulfilled, and  thus keeps calling itself forever. You run into a java.lang.StackOverFlowError, which  means there is no stack memory left, because every method call causes a new block to be  created on the stack.  The heap memory is used at runtime to allocate memory for objects and JRE classes.   Objects are instances of JDK classes or developer defined classes. Any object created  with new is stored inside the heap memory. Objects created inside the heap memory  can be accessed by all threads of the application. Access and management of the heap  memory are a little more complex and is covered more in Chapter 13. The -Xms and  -Xmx JVM parameters set the initial and maximum size of the heap memory for a Java  program during execution. The heap size may vary, depending on the number of objects  created by the program, and if all heap memory allocated to a Java program is full, then a  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError is thrown.  The JVM parameters are useful because during development, you might have to  write code that solves complex problems and that needs a bigger than usual stack or  heap memory, so instead of relying on the default sizes, you can set your own. Stack and  heap default values are platform-specific. If you are interested in these values, check out  the official documentation at https:  docs.oracle.com cd E13150_01 jrockit_jvm  jrockit jrdocs refman optionX.html, which covers all JVM parameters and default  values. You can open the link in your browser and search for -Xss, -Xms, or -Xmx. The java.lang.String class is the most used class in the Java programming   language. Because text values within an application might have the same value, for  efficiency reasons this type of objects are managed a little different within the heap. In  the heap there is a special memory region called the StringPool where all the String   1 When the call ends, the block is removed  popped out  and new blocks are created for methods  being called after that. The first element in a stack it’s called head. Operations performed on a  stack have specific names: adding an element to the stack is called a push operation, inspecting  the first element in the stack is called a peek or top operation and extracting the first element in  the stack, its head, is called pop.  154   Chapter 5    Data types  instances are stored by the JVM. This had to be mentioned here because the following  piece of code that is analyzed to explain how memory is managed in Java contains a  definition of a String instance, but the String Pool and other details about the String  data type is covered in detail in its own section later in the chapter.  Let’s consider the following executable class, and imagine how the memory is   organized during the execution of this program.  01.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5; 02. 03.  import java.util.Date; 04. 05.  public class PrimitivesDemo { 06. 07.    public static void main String... args  { 08.         int i = 5; 09.         int j = 7; 10.         Date d = new Date  ; 11.         int result = add i, j ; 12.         System.out.print result ; 13.         d = null; 14.    } 15. 16.    static int add int a, int b  { 17.        String mess = new String "performing add ..." ; 18.        return a + b; 19.    } 20.  }  Can you figure out which variables are saved on the stack and which are on the   heap? Let’s go over the program line by line to see what is happening.     As soon as the program starts, Runtime classes that JVM need are   loaded in the heap memory.     The main   method is discovered in line 07 so a stack memory is   created to be used during the execution of this method.     Primitive local variable in line 08, i=5, is created and stored in the   stack memory of main   method.  155   Chapter 5    Data types     Primitive local variable in line 09, j=7, is created and stored in the   stack memory of main   method. At this point, the program memory  looks like what’s depicted in Figure 5-1.  Figure 5-1.  Java stack and heap memory, after declaring two primitive variables      In line 10 an object of type java.util.Date is declared, so this object  is created and stored in the heap memory and a reference named d  is saved on the stack. At this point, the program memory looks like  what’s depicted in Figure 5-2.  Figure 5-2.  Java stack and heap memory, after declaring two primitive variables  and an object  156   Chapter 5    Data types          In line 11 method add   is called with arguments i and j. This means  their values is copied into the local variables for this method named a  and b and these two is stored in the memory block for this method.  Inside the add ..  method body, in line 17 a String instance is  declared. So, the String object is created in the heap memory, in the  String Pool memory block, and the reference named mess is stored ,  in the stack, in the memory block for this method. At this point, the  program memory looks like what’s shown in Figure 5-3.  Figure 5-3.  Java stack and heap memory, after calling the add ..  method     Also in line 11, the result of the execution of the add ..  method is  stored in the local variable named result. Because at this point, the  add ..  method has finished its execution, its stack block is discarded.  Thus we can conclude that variables that are stored on the stack exist  for as long as the function that created them is running. At this point in  the stack memory of main   method the result variable is saved.  157   Chapter 5    Data types          In line 12, the print method is called, but we’ll skip the explanation  for this line for simplicity reasons.  In line 13, the d reference is assigned a null value, which means,  the object of type Date is now only in the heap, and it is not linked  to the execution of the main method in any way. Look at it like this:  in that line, we are basically telling the JVM that were are no longer  interested in that object, which means the space containing it can be  collected and used to store other objects.  At this point, the program memory looks like what’s shown in Figure 5-4.  Figure 5-4.  Java stack and heap memory, before the ending of the main ..   method execution  After the program exits all memory contents are discarded.  158   Chapter 5    Data types  !  When applying for a Java developer position, you will most likely be asked  about the differences between stack and heap memory. so, if you think that the  previous section did not clarify this for you, please feel free to consult additional  resources.2   Introduction to Java Data Types The previous example showed that data types in Java can be split into two big groups  based on where they are stored during execution: primitive types and reference types. I’ll  introduce them briefly and explain their most important members later.   Primitive Data Types Primitive types are defined by the Java programming language as special types that do  not have a supporting class and are named by their reserved keyword. Variables of these  types are saved on the stack memory and when values are assigned to them using the =   equals  operator, the value is actually copied. So, if we declare two primitive variables  of type int, as in the following code listing, we end up with two variables, k and q, both  having the same value: 42.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class PrimitivesDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         int k = 42;         int q = k;          System.out.println "k = " + k ;         System.out.println "q = " + q ;     } }  2 A very good article about this subject is at https:  www.journaldev.com 4098  java-heap-space-vs-stack-memory  159   Chapter 5    Data types  When passed as arguments to other methods, the values of primitive values are copied   and used without the initial variables being modified. This can be proved by creating a  method to swap the values of two int variables. The following is the code for the method.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class PrimitivesDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         int k = 42;         int q = 44;          swap k, q ;          System.out.println "k = " + k ;         System.out.println "q = " + q ;     }      static void swap int a, int b  {         int temp = a;         a = b;         b  =  temp;     } }  So, what do you think is printed as values for k and q? If you thought the output is the   same as the following, you are correct.  k = 42 q = 44  160  This happens because in Java passing arguments to a method is done through their  value, which means for primitives, changing the formal parameter’s value doesn’t affect  the actual parameter’s value. If you read the previous section, you can already imagine  what happens on the stack. When the swap   method is called a new stack memory  block is created to save the values used by this method. During the execution of the  method, the values might change, but if they are not returned and assigned to variables  in the calling method, the values are lost when the method execution ends. Figure 5-5   depicts the changes that take place on the stack during the execution of the code  previously listed. As you can obviously notice, the heap memory is not used at all.   Chapter 5    Data types  Figure 5-5.  Java passing primitive arguments by value  Reference Data Types There are four reference types in Java:                  class types  interface types  enums  array types  Reference types are different from primitive types as these types are instantiable    except interfaces . Objects of these types are created by calling constructors, and  variables of these types are references to objects stored in the heap. Because the  references are stored on the stack as well, even if we modify the previous code to use  references, the behavior is the same. Let’s introduce a class named IntContainer, whose  only purpose is to wrap primitive values into objects.  161   And now we create two objects of this type and two references for them and rewrite   Chapter 5    Data types  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class IntContainer {      private int value;      public IntContainer int value  {         this.value = value;     }      public int getValue   {         return value;     }      public void setValue int value  {         this.value  =  value;     } }  the swap method.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ReferencesDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         IntContainer k = new IntContainer 42 ;         IntContainer q = new IntContainer 44 ;          swap k,q ;          System.out.println "k = " + k.getValue   ;         System.out.println "q = " + q.getValue   ;     }      static void swap IntContainer a, IntContainer b  {         IntContainer temp = a;         a = b;         b = temp;     } }  162   If we run the main ..  method, you notice that we still get  Chapter 5    Data types  k = 42 q = 44  How can this be explained? In the same manner, Java still uses the same style of   arguments passing by value, only this time, the value of the reference is the one passed.  Figure 5-6 depicts what is going on in the memory managed by the JVM for the execution  of the previous code.  Figure 5-6.  Java passing reference arguments by value  In a similar manner, the references to the objects are interchanged in the body of the   swap ..  method, but they have no effect on the k and q references, and neither on the  objects they point to in the heap. To really exchange the values, we need to exchange the  content of the objects by using a new object. Look at the following new version of the  swap ..  method.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ReferencesDemo {  163   Chapter 5    Data types      public static void main String... args  {         IntContainer k = new IntContainer 42 ;         IntContainer q = new IntContainer 44 ;          swap k,q ;          System.out.println "k = " + k.getValue   ;         System.out.println "q = " + q.getValue   ;     }      static void swap IntContainer a, IntContainer b  {         IntContainer temp = new IntContainer a.getValue   ;         a.setValue b.getValue   ;         b.setValue temp.getValue   ;     } }  By making use of setters and getters, we exchange the values of the objects, because  the references are never modified inside the body of the method. Figure 5-7 depicts what  happens within the memory during execution of the previous piece of code.  Figure 5-7.  Java passing reference arguments by value, swapping object contents  164   Maybe this example was introduced too early, but it was needed so you could witness as  early as possible the major differences between primitive and reference types. We’ll list all the  differences in the summary, until then, let’s introduce the most used data types in Java.  Chapter 5    Data types   Java Primitive Types Primitive types are the basic types of data in Java. Variables of this type can be created by  directly assigning values of that type, so they are not instantiated. That would be pretty  difficult to do since these types are not backed up by a class  In Java there are 8 types of  primitive types, six of them used to represent numbers, one to represent characters and  one to represent boolean values. Primitive types are predefined into the Java language  and they have names that are reserved keywords. Primitive variables can have values  only in the interval or dataset that is predefined for that type. When declared as fields of  a class at instantiation time, a default value specific to the type is assigned to the field.  Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values.  Most Java tutorials introduce the numeric types first, but this book starts with the   non-numerics.   The Boolean Type Variables of this type can have only one of the two accepted values: true and false. This  type of variable is used in conditions to decide a course of action. The values true and  false are themselves reserved keywords. Default value for a boolean variable is false.  Another observation: when a field is of type boolean the getter for it has a different   syntax. It is not prefixed with get but with is. This makes sense because of what boolean  values are used for. They model properties with only two values. For example, let’s say we  are writing a class to model a conversion process. A boolean field marks the process state  as done or still in process. If the name of the field is done, a getter named getDone   would  be pretty unintuitive and stupid, but one named isDone   would be quite the opposite.  Let’s write that class and also add a main method to test the default value of the done field.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ConvertProcess {      * other fields and methods *   165   Chapter 5    Data types      private boolean done;      public boolean isDone   {         return done;     }      public void setDone boolean done  {         this.done = done;     }      public static void main String... args  {         ConvertProcess cp = new ConvertProcess  ;          System.out.println "Default value = " + cp.isDone   ;     } }  And as expected, the output printed is  Default value = false  The boolean type is not compatible with any other primitive type, assigning a   boolean value to an int variable by simple assignment using =  is not possible. Explicit  conversion is not possible either. So, writing something like the following causes a  compilation error.  boolean f = false; int fi =  int  f;  We’ll be adding more information about this type in Chapter 6.   The char Type The char type represents characters. The values are 16-bit unsigned integers  representing UTF-16 code units. The interval of the possible values for char variables  is : from '\u0000' to '\uffff' inclusive, as numbers this means: from 0 to 65535.  This means that we can try to print the full set of values. As the representation of the  characters is numeric, this means we can convert int values from interval to char values.  The following code snippet, prints all the numeric values of the char interval and their  matching characters.  166   Chapter 5    Data types  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class CharLister {     public static void main String... args  {         for  int i = 0; i < 65536; ++i   {             char c =  char  i;             System.out.println "c[" + i + "]=" + c ;         }     } }  !  the last char value the for loop statement prints is 65535. the 65536 value is  used as an upper maximum value. so, if i=65336, then nothing gets printed and  the execution of the statement ends. the for loop is covered in detail in Chapter 8:  Controlling the flow.  Depending on the operating system, some of the characters might not be supported,   so they won’t be displayed, or they are replaced with a bogus character. The same goes  for whitespace characters.  If you think the interval dedicated to represent characters is too big, scroll the   console and you will understand why. The UTF-16 character set contains all numbers as  characters, all separators, characters from Chinese, Arabic and a lot more symbols.3   Integer Primitives In the code samples used so far to introduce Java language basics, we mostly used  variables of type int, but there is more than one numeric primitive type in Java.  Java defines six primitive numeric types, and each of them has a specific internal  representation, on a certain number of bits, which means that there is a minimum and  a maximum value. There are four numeric types to represent integer values and two  numeric types to represent real numbers. Figure 5-8 shows the integer types and the  interval of the values for each of them.  3 A complete list of the symbols and their meanings can be found at https:  www.fileformat. info info charset UTF-16 list.htm  167   Chapter 5    Data types  Figure 5-8.  Java numeric types to represent integer values  Anything in a computer is represented using bits of information, each bit can  only have a value of 1 or 0, which is why it is called binary representation. Binary  representation is not the focus of this book, but a short mention is made because it is  important. You might be wondering now why the binary representation was chosen for  our computers? Well, primarily because data  in memory and on storage  is stored using  a series of ones  on  and zeros  off  binary representations; also binary operations are  really easy to do, and this makes computers very fast. Let’s take math for example, we  widely use the decimal system, which is made of 10 unique digits, from 0 to 9. Internally  computers use a binary system, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1. To represent  numbers bigger than 1, we need more bits. So, in a decimal system we have: 0, 1, 2 , 3,  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and so forth, in a binary system to represent numbers we only have  two digits, so we’ll have: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, and so forth. If you imagine  a box in which you can only put ones and zeroes to represent numbers like a computer  does, you need more as the numbers get bigger. A bit can only have two values, so the  number of values to represent it is defined by a power of 2. Look at Figure 5-9.  168   Chapter 5    Data types  Figure 5-9.  Binary numeric representation  So, on one bit we can represent two values, which is 21,on two bits we can represent   four values, which is 22 and so on. So, that is how we refer to Java primitive numeric types  representation boundaries, sometimes including a bit for the sign as well. Thus, the  following list contains the integer primitive types and their boundaries.          byte represents numbers between −27 and 27-1 inclusive  [-128,  127] . Default value for a byte field is 0 and is represented on 8 bits. short represents numbers between −215 and 215 − 1 inclusive    [-32768, 32767] . The values interval for this type is a superset of  the byte values interval, thus a byte value can be safely assigned to a  short variable without the need for an explicit conversion. This goes  for all types that have the values interval a superset of the one for the  byte type. In the next code snippet, a byte value is assigned to a short  variable and the code compiles and when executed prints 23.  Default value for a short field is 0 and is represented on 16 bits.  byte bv = 23; short sbv = bv; System.out.println "byte to short: " + sbv ;      int represents integer numbers between −231 and 231−1 inclusive    [-2147483648, 2147483647] . Default value for a byte field is 0 and  is represented on 32 bits.  169   Chapter 5    Data types      long represents integer numbers between −263 and 263 − 1 inclusive   [-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]  Default value  for a byte field is 0 and is represented on 64 bits.  In practice sometimes the need to work with integer numbers outside the   !  interval long appears. For this situations, in Java a special class  yes a class, not a  primitive type  was defined and is named BigInteger that allocates just as much  memory is needed to store a number of any size. Operations with BigInteger  might be slow, but this is the trade off to work with huge numbers.   Real Primitives Real numbers are useful because most prices and most arithmetic operations executed  by programs do not result in an integer number. Real numbers contain a decimal point  and decimals after it. To represent real numbers in Java, two primitive types  called  floating-point types  are defined: float and double. Let’s discuss each of them in a little  more detail.      float represents single-precision 32-bit format IEEE 754 values as  specified in IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic,  ANSI IEEE Standard 754-1985  IEEE, New York .The default value  is 0.0. A floating-point variable can represent a wider range of  numbers than a fixed point variable of the same bit width at the  cost of precision. Because of this values of type int or long can be  assigned to variables of type float. What is actually happening and  why the loss of precision? Well, a number is represented as a floating-  point number and an exponent, which is a power of 10. So, when the  floating-point number is multiplied with 10 at this exponent power,  the initial number should result. Let’s take the maximum long value,  assign it to a float variable, and check what is printed.  float maxLongF = Long.MAX_VALUE; System.out.println "max long= " + Long.MAX_VALUE ; System.out.println "float max long= " + maxLongF ;  170   The Long.MAX_VALUE is a final static variable that has the maximum long value   assigned to it: 9223372036854775807. The preceding code prints the following.  Chapter 5    Data types  max long= 9223372036854775807 float max long= 9.223372E18  As you can see, the maxLongF number should be equal to 9223372036854775807, but   because it is represented as a smaller number and a power of 10, precision is lost. Because  if we were to reconstruct the integer number by multiplying 9.223372 with 1018 gives us  9223372000000000000. So yeah, close, but not close enough. So, what are the interval edges  for float? Float represents real numbers between 1.4E −45 and 2128 * 1038.      double represents single-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values as  specified in IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, ANSI  IEEE Standard 754-1985  IEEE, New York and represents numbers  between 4.9E −324 and 2127 * 10308. The default value is 0.0.  !  Values 0 and 0.0 are different in Java. to a normal user, they both mean zero,  but in mathematics, the one with the decimal point is more precise. still in Java  we are allowed to compare an int value to a float value, and if we compare 0  and 0.0, the result is that they are equal. also positive zero and negative zero are  considered equal; thus the result of the comparison 0.0==-0.0 is true.  Developers cannot define a primitive type by defining it from scratch or by extending   an existing primitive type. Type names are reserved Java keywords, which cannot be  redefined by a developer. It is prohibited to declare fields, methods, or class names that  are named as those types.  A variable that we intend to use must be declared first. When it is declared, a value  can be associated as well. For primitive values, a number can be written in many ways.  The following shows a few samples of how numeric values can be written when variables  are initialized or assigned afterward.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class NumericDemo {     private byte b;     private short s;  171   Chapter 5    Data types      private int i;     private long l;     private float f;     private double d;      public static void main String... args  {         NumericDemo nd = new NumericDemo  ;          nd.b = 0b1100;         System.out.println "Byte binary value: " + nd.b ;          nd.i = 42 ;        decimal case          nd.i = 045 ;       octal case - base 8         System.out.println "Int octal value: " + nd.i ;          nd.i = 0xcafe ;    hexadecimal case - base 16         System.out.println "Int hexadecimal value: " + nd.i ;          nd.i = 0b10101010101010101010101010101011;         System.out.println "Int binary value: " + nd.i ;            Java 7 syntax         nd.i = 0b1010_1010_1010_1010_1010_1010_1010_1011;         System.out.println "Int binary value: " + nd.i ;          nd.l = 1000_000l;    equivalent to 1000_000L         System.out.println "Long value: " + nd.l ;          nd.f =  5;          System.out.println "Integer value assigned to a float variable:            nd.f =  2.5f;    equivalent to nd.f =    2.5F;          System.out.println "Decimal value assigned to a float variable:            nd.d =  2.5d;    equivalent to  nd.d =  2.5D;          System.out.println "Decimal value assigned to a double variable:    " + nd.f ;  " + nd.f ;  " + nd.f ;      } }  172   Starting with Java 7, the "_" is permitted to be used when declaring numeric values  to group digits and increase clarity. When running the previous code, the following is  printed.  Chapter 5    Data types  Byte binary value: 12 Int octal value: 37 Int hexadecimal value: 51966 Int binary value: -1431655765 Int binary value: -1431655765 Long value: 1000000 Integer value assigned to a float variable: 5.0 Decimal value assigned to a float variable: 2.5 Decimal value assigned to a double variable: 2.5  Since no formatting is done when the variables are printed, the values depicted in   the console are in the decimal system.  For now, this is all that can be said about the primitive types. Each of the primitive  types has a matching reference type defined within the JDK, and converting a primitive  value to its equivalent reference is called boxing and the reverse process is called  unboxing. In certain situation those processes are done explicitly, but more about that  later.   Java Reference Types Java Reference Types were described earlier to highlight the differences between  primitive and reference types. It is now time to expand that description and give some  examples of the most used JDK reference types when programming.  Objects or instances are created using the new keyword followed by the call of a   constructor. The constructor is a special member of a class, used to create an object  by initializing all fields of the class with their default values, or values received as  arguments. A class instance is created by calling the class constructor  one of them,  because there might be more than one defined within the class . So, considering the  example that we had in Chapter 4, the Performer class, to declare a reference to an  object of type Performer the following expression is used.  Performer human = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;  173   Chapter 5    Data types  The interface reference types cannot be instantiated, but objects of class types that  extend that interface can be assigned to references of that interface type. The hierarchy  used in Chapter 4 is depicted in Figure 5-10.  Based on this hierarchy, the following four statements are valid and they compile.  Figure 5-10.  Class and interface hierarchy  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.*;  public class ReferencesDemo {      public static void main String... args  {          Performer performer = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         Human human = new Performer "Jack", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         Actor actor = new Performer "Jean", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;          Musician musician = new Performer "Jodie", 40, 1.71f, Gender.  FEMALE ;      } }  In the example, we created four objects of type Performer and assigned them to   different reference types, including two interface reference types. If we were to inspect  the stack and heap contents for the preceding method, Figure 5-11 shows what we would  find.  Figure 5-11   174   Chapter 5    Data types  All the references in the previous example point to different objects in the heap, but   Figure 5-11.  Multiple reference types  the following code is possible as well.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.*;  public class ReferencesDemo {      public static void main String... args  {          Performer performer = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         Human human = performer;         Actor actor = performer;         Musician musician = performer;      } }  175   Chapter 5    Data types  In the code snippet, we’ve created only one object, but multiple references to it,   of different types. If we were to inspect the stack and heap contents for the preceding  method, Figure 5-12 shows what we would find.  Figure 5-12.  Multiple reference types, second example  References can only be of the super-type of an assigned object, so the assignments in   the following code snippet will not compile.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.*;  public class ReferencesDemo {      public static void main String... args  {          Performer performer = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         Human human = performer;         Actor actor = performer;         Musician musician = performer;  176   Chapter 5    Data types            these will not compile!!!         performer = musician;           or         performer = human;           or         performer = actor;      } }  The reason for that is that the methods are called on the reference, so the object the  reference is pointing to must have those methods. So, if a reference is of type Performer  and getSongs   gets called on it, an object of type actor, like in the last line of code will  not have that method. That is why the Java compiler complains, and that is why smart  editors notify you by underlining the statement with a red line.  Sure, an explicit conversion can be made: performer =  Performer  actor;, and  this convinces the compiler that all is well, but this only causes an exception at runtime.   Arrays The new keyword can also be used to create arrays. In a similar manner, it creates objects.  An array is a data structure that holds a group of variables together. Its size is defined  when it is created, and it cannot be changed.  Each variable can be accessed using an index that starts at 0 and goes up to the   length of the array to –1. Arrays can hold primitive and reference values. Let’s declare a  few arrays to show you how versatile and useful they are. Let’s declare first an array field  and check what is happening with it when an object is created.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ArraysDemo {      int array[];      public static void main String... args  {         ArraysDemo ad = new ArraysDemo  ;         System.out.println "array was initialized with " + ad.array ;     } }  177   Chapter 5    Data types  What do you think is printed in the console when the preceding code is executed? If   you assumed that the ad.array field is initialed with null, you were right.  Arrays are reference types, and thus when left to the JVM to initialize fields of this  type with a default value, null is used, as this is the typical default value for reference  types.  The null keyword represents a non-existing value. A reference that is assigned   this value does not have a concrete object assigned to it; it does not point to an object  in the heap. That is why when writing code, if an object is used  through its reference,  of course  before being initialized, a NullPointerException is thrown. This is why  developers test equality to null before using the object  or array . Let’s modify the  previous example to do that.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ArraysDemo {      int array[];      public static void main String... args  {         ArraysDemo ad = new ArraysDemo  ;          if  ad.array == null  {             System.out.println "array unusable" ;         }     } }  Why do we need the null keyword to mark something that does not exist yet?   Because it is common practice in programming to declare a reference first and initialize  it only when first time used. This is useful, especially for objects that tend to be large in  size, and the process is called lazy loading.  Back to arrays. Let’s properly initialize the array field previously declared and give it a   size to see what happens.  1.   package com.apress.bgn.ch5; 2. 3.   public class ArraysDemo { 4. 5.       public static void main String... args  {  178   Chapter 5    Data types  6.           int[] array =  new int[2]; 7.          for  int i = 0; i <  array.length; ++i  { 8.               System.out.println "array["+ i +"]= " + array[i] ; 9.           } 10.       } 11.   }  The initialization of the Array takes place in line 6 and the size of the array is 2. The   size of the array is given as a parameter to what it looks like a constructor call, only  instead of parentheses, square brackets are used. By setting the dimension of the array  to 2, we are telling the JVM that two adjacent memory locations must be put aside for  this object to store two int values in. And because, no values were specified as the array  contents, what do you think they are filled with when the array is created? Well, this is a  simple one: the previous array is defined to be made of two int values, so when the array  is initialized, the default value for the int type is used. Figure 5-13 depicts what happens  in the stack and heap memory when the previous code is executed.  Figure 5-13.  Declaring an int array of size 2  In lines 7 to 9, a for loop prints the values of the array. The int i variable is what we  call an index variable and traverses all values of the array in increments of 1 in each step  of the loop. The array.length is the property containing the size of the array, how many  elements the array contains. As you probably expected, the output printed in the console is  179   Chapter 5    Data types  array[0]= 0 array[1]= 0  To put values in an array, we have the following choices.     We access the element directly and we set the value.  array[0] = 5; array[1] = 7;   or for  int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i  {         array[i] = i; }     We initialize the array explicitly with the values we intend to store.  int another[] = {1,4,3,2};  Arrays can contain references as well. The following code sample depicts how a   Performer array can be used.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.*; public class PerformerArrayDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         Performer[] array = new Performer[2];         for  int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i  {             System.out.println "performer[" + i + "]= " + array[i]  ;         }          array[0] = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         array[1] = new Performer "Julianna", 35, 1.61f, Gender.FEMALE ;          for  int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i  {              System.out.println "performer[" + i + "]= " + array[i].  getName    ;          }     } }  180   And because depicting the memory contents makes it more clear what happens with   our array and objects, I give to you Figure 5-14.  Chapter 5    Data types  Figure 5-14.  Declaring an array of Performers with size 2  So yeah, we have an array of references, and the object they point to can be changed   during the program.  Arrays can be multidimensional. If you studied advanced math, you probably   remember the matrix concept, which was a rectangular array arranged in rows and  columns. In Java, you can model matrices by using arrays. If you want a simple matrix  with rows and columns, you define an array with two dimensions.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class MatricesDemo {     public static void main String... args  {            bi-dimensional array: 2 rows, 2 columns         int[][] intMatrix = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}};          int[][] intMatrix2 = new int[2][2];         for  int i = 0; i < intMatrix2.length; ++i  {             for  int j = 0; j < intMatrix2[i].length; ++j  {                 intMatrix2[i][j] = i + j;                 System.out.print intMatrix[i][j] + " " ;             }  181   Chapter 5    Data types              System.out.println  ;         }     } }  next code snippet defines only three of them.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  But you can get multidimensional and define as many coordinates as you want. The   public class MatricesDemo {     public static void main String... args  {            cubical matrix, with three coordinates         int[][][] intMatrix3 = new int[2][2][2];         for  int i = 0; i < intMatrix3.length; ++i  {             for  int j = 0; j < intMatrix3[i].length; ++j  {                 for  int k = 0; k < intMatrix3[i][j].length; ++k  {                     intMatrix3[i][j][k] = i + j + k;                     System.out.print "["+i+", "+j+", " + k + "]" ;                 }                 System.out.println  ;             }             System.out.println  ;         }  When it comes to arrays, make them as big as you need them and your memory   allows, but make sure to initialize them and make sure in your code that you do not try to  access indexes outside the allowed range. If the size of an array is N, then its last index is  N-1 and its first is 0. Try to access any index outside that range and an exception of type  java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown at runtime. So writing code like  this  int array = new int[2]; array[5] =7;      } }  182   Chapter 5    Data types  causes your program to crash at runtime, and the following is printed in the console.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:     Index 5 out of bounds for length 2 at chapter.five.collections com.apress.bgn.ch5.ArraysDemo.main ArraysDemo. java:56   For easier handling of arrays in Java, there is a special class: java.util.Arrays. This  class provides utility methods to sort and compare arrays, search elements, and convert  their content to text or a stream, so that they can print without writing the tedious for  loop.  int array = new int2;  System.out.println Arrays.toString ad.array  ;   or Arrays.stream array .forEach ai -> System.out.println ai  ;   or using methods reference Arrays.stream array .forEach System.out::println ;   sorting Arrays.sort another ;  Feel free to modify the code provided for this chapter to try some of those methods.   The String Type The next special Java type on our list is String. You’ve seen it being used quite often until  now, without a detailed explanation. Together with the primitive int, this is one of the  most used types in Java. String instances model texts and perform all kinds of operations  on them. The String type is a special type, because objects of this type are given  special treatment by the JVM. If you remember the first image with memory contents,  String objects are allocated in the heap in a special place called the String Pool. This  section is dedicated to it; the String type is covered in detail, and a lot of your questions  you might have about this type should get answered.  Until now String variables were declared in this book like this:  String name= "John";  183   Chapter 5    Data types  But the String class has many constructors to initialize String variables. The   following is a set of String variables being declared and initialized.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5.refs;  public class StringDemo {      public static void main String... args  { 1.      String  text1 = null; 2. 3.      String text21 = "two"; 4.      String text22 = "two"; 5.      String text23 = new String  "two" ; 6. 7.      String piece1 = "t"; 8.      String piece2  = "wo"; 9.      String text24 = piece1 + piece2; 10. 11.     char[] twoCh = {'t', 'w', 'o'}; 12.     String text25 = new String twoCh ;     } }  Lines 3, 4, 5, 9, and 11 all define a String object with the same content two. We   intentionally did that, creating multiple String objects with the same value. In real life  applications, especially in this big data hype period, applications handle a lot of data,  most of it text form. So, being able to compress the data and reuse it would reduce the  memory consumption, also reducing memory access attempts also increases speed by  reducing processing, which in turn reduces costs.  Before continuing this section, I have to discuss what object equality means in   Java. Objects are handled in Java using references to them. The == operator compares  references; but if we want to compare the objects, we must use the equals   method.  This is a special method inherited from the Object class.  In Java String instances are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once   created. This means that the JVM can reuse existing values to form new string values,  without consuming additional memory. This process is called interning. One copy of  each text value  literal  is saved to a special memory region called String Pool. When   184   Chapter 5    Data types  a new String variable is created and a value is assigned to it, the JVM first searches the  pool for a string of equal value. If found, a reference to this memory address is returned,  without allocating additional memory. If not found, it’ll be added to the pool and its  reference is returned.  This being said, considering the preceding sample code, we expect for text21 and  text22 variable to point to the same String object in the pool, which means references  are equal too. Let’s test that.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5.refs;  public class StringDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         String text21 = "two";         String text22 = "two";          if  text21 == text22  {             System.out.println "Equal References" ;         } else {             System.out.println "Different References" ;         }          if  text21.equals text22   {             System.out.println "Equal Objects" ;         } else {             System.out.println "Different Objects" ;         }     } }  When running the preceding code, the following is printed in the console, proving   the previous affirmations and the existence of the String pool.  Equal References Equal Objects  is executed.  Figure 5-15 shows an abstract representation of the memory contents when the code   185   Chapter 5    Data types  Figure 5-15.  String Pool example  When a new String object is created using the new operator, the JVM allocate new   memory for a new object and store it in the heap, so the String pool won’t be used.  This results in every String object created like this having its own memory region with  its own address. That is why if we were to compare variable text22 and variable text23,  from the initial code sample, we would expect their references to be different, but the  objects should be equal. Let’s test that.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5.refs;  public class StringDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         String text22 = "two";         String text23 = new String  "two" ;          if  text22 == text23  {             System.out.println "Equal References" ;         } else {             System.out.println "Different References" ;         }  186   Chapter 5    Data types          if  text22.equals text23   {             System.out.println "Equal Objects" ;         } else {             System.out.println "Different Objects" ;         }     } }  When running the preceding code, the following is printed in the console, proving   everything that was mentioned before.  Different References Equal Objects  previous example.4  I leave it up to you to imagine what the stack and heap memory look like in the   The String Pool has a default size of 1009. Starting with Java 6, its size can be   modified using the -XX:StringTableSize.  ** Lines 11 and 12 in the initial code sample depict how a String instance  is created from a char[3] array. Until Java 8, internally that was the initial  representation for string: arrays of characters. a character is represented on 2  bytes, which means a lot of memory was consumed for Strings. In Java 9, a new  representation was introduced called Compact String, which uses byte[] or  char[] depending on the content. this means that the memory consumed by your  String processing application is significantly lower starting with Java 9.   Escaping Characters There are special characters that cannot be part of a String value. As you have probably  noticed, String values are defined between double quotes  "sample"  and this makes  the " double quote  character unusable as a value. To use it as a String value, it has to   4 If you want to check if you understood memory management and Strings correctly, you  are welcome to draw your own picture and sent it to the author for a review and a technical  discussion.  187   Chapter 5    Data types  be escaped. Aside from this character there is also the \ backslash  and the \a alert .  Figure 5-16 shows how IntelliJ IDEA tries to tell you that you cannot use those characters  in the content of a String value.  Figure 5-16.  Code samples with special characters  To escape those characters, a backlash must be inserted before them. The ' single   quote  must be escaped as well when used as a character value.  There are some other Java escape sequences that can be used in String values to get   char quote = '\";  a certain effect, which are listed in Table 5-1. Table 5-1.  Java Escape Sequences  Escape Sequence Effect  Create a new line  often called the newline character   Create a tab  Create a backspace character  which might delete the preceding character,  depending on the output device   return to the start of the line  but do not make a new line, the equivalent of the  Home key on the keyboard   Form feed  move to the top of the next page for printers   \n  \t  \b  \r  \f  188   Chapter 5    Data types  The newline \n and the tab \t character are used often in programming to properly   format console output. If we define a String instance like the following,  String perf = "The singers performing tonight are: \n\t Paolo Nutini \n\t  Seth MacFarlane      \n\t John Mayer";  When printed in the console, the text is formatted to look like this:  The singers performing tonight are:          Paolo Nutini          Seth MacFarlane          John Mayer   Wrapper Classes Each primitive type has a corresponding reference type. Before covering each of them  and explaining why they are needed, please take a look at Table 5-2. The Java wrapper  classes wrap a value of the primitive type with the same name.  Table 5-2.  Java Primitive and Equivalent Reference Types  Primitive  byte  short  int  long  float  double  boolean  char  Class  java.lang.Byte  java.lang.Short  java.lang.Integer  java.lang.Long  java.lang.Float  java.lang.Double  java.lang.Boolean  java.lang.Char  In addition, these classes provide methods for converting primitive values to String   and vice versa, as well as constants and methods useful when dealing with primitive  types that need to be treated as objects. The numeric wrapper classes are related, all of  them extend the Number class, as depicted in Figure 5-17.  189   Chapter 5    Data types  Figure 5-17.  Wrapper classes hierarchy  The following code samples mostly use the Integer class, but the other numeric   wrapper classes can be used in a similar way. The JVM knows how to convert a primitive  int into an Integer object automatically when needed, operation that is called boxing  and from an Integer object to a primitive int, operation that is called unboxing. The  following code sample contains a few operations with Integer and int values.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5.refs;  public class WrapperDemo {     public static void main String... args  {            upper interval boundary for int         Integer max =  Integer.MAX_VALUE;         System.out.println max ;            unboxing         int pmax =  max;            boxing         Integer io = 10;            creating primitive utility method           exception is thrown, if string is not a number         int i1 = Integer.parseInt "11" ;            constructor deprecated in Java 9           exception is thrown, if string is not a number         Integer i2 = new Integer "12" ;  190   Chapter 5    Data types            exception is thrown, if string is not a number         Integer i3 = Integer.valueOf "12" ;            convert int into to String         String s0 = Integer.toString 13 ;            convert int to float         float f0 = Integer.valueOf 14 .floatValue  ;            creating string with binary representation of number 9  1001          String  s1  =  Integer.toBinaryString 9 ;            introduced in Java 1.8         Integer i4 = Integer.parseUnsignedInt "+15" ;            method to add to integers         int sum = Integer.sum 2, 3 ;            method to get the bigger value         int maximum = Integer.max 2, 7 ;     } }  The Character and Boolean types are a little bit different, because these types are not   numeric, so they cannot be converted to any numeric value. They cannot be converted  one to another either. Oracle provides really good documentation for its classes, so if you  are curious about using these two types, check out the official JDK API documentation  at https:  docs.oracle.com javase 10 docs api index.html?overview-summary. html.   Date Time API A lot of applications make use of calendar date types to print the current date, deadlines,  and birthdays. No matter what application you decide to build you most likely need to  use calendar dates. Until Java 8, the main class to model a calendar date was java.util. Date. There are a few problems with this class and others involved in handling calendar  dates. But before we get into that, let’s see how we can get the current date, create a  custom date, and print certain details.  191   Chapter 5    Data types  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import java.util.Date; import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;  public class CalendarDateDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat "dd-MM-yyyy" ;         Date currentDate = new Date  ;         System.out.println "Today: " + sdf.format currentDate  ;            deprecated since 1.1         Date johnBirthday = new Date 77, 9, 16 ;         System.out.println "John’s Birthday: " + sdf.format johnBirthday  ;          int day = johnBirthday.getDay  ;         System.out.println "Day: " + day ;         int month = johnBirthday.getMonth   + 1;         System.out.println "Month: " + month ;         int year = johnBirthday.getYear  ;         System.out.println "Year: " + year ;     } }  Getting the current date is simple; just call the default constructor of the Date class.  Date currentDate = new Date  ;  The contents of the currentDate can be displayed directly, but usually an instance  of java.text.SimpleDateFormat is used to format the date to a pattern that is country  specific. The formatter can also be used to convert a String with that specific format  intro a Date instance. Of course, if the text does not match the pattern of the formatter, a  specific exception is thrown  type: java.text.ParseException   SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat "dd-MM-yyyy" ; System.out.println currentDate ; System.out.println "Today: " + sdf.format currentDate  ; Date johnBirthday = sdf.parse "16-10-1977" ;  192   Chapter 5    Data types  To create a Date instance from the numbers representing a date: year, month and   day, a constructor that takes those values as arguments can be used, although that  constructor has been deprecated since Java 1.1, and the recommended way is to use  the sdf.parse ..  method. The constructor has a few particularities regarding its  arguments.          changes the technical meaning again the year argument must be the  intended year value from which 1900 is subtracted  the months are counted from 0, so the month to give as an argument,  must be the month we want –1  The code to construct a Date from the numeric values for the year, month, and day is   depicted as follows.    deprecated since 1.1 Date johnBirthday = new Date 77, 9, 16 ; System.out.println "John's Birthday: " + sdf.format johnBirthday  ;   it prints: John's Birthday: 16-10-1977  If we want to extract the year, month, and day of the month from the date, there are   methods for that: the method to extract the day of the month is named getDate  .  try {       johnBirthday = sdf.parse "16-10-1977" ; } catch  ParseException e  {      e.printStackTrace  ; } System.out.println "John's Birthday: " + sdf.format johnBirthday  ;    day of the month int day = johnBirthday.getDate  ; System.out.println "Day: " + day ;  int month = johnBirthday.getMonth   + 1; System.out.println "Month:  "  +  month ;  int year = johnBirthday.getYear  ; System.out.println "Year: " + year ;  193   Chapter 5    Data types  If you inspect the CalendarDateDemo class in the IntelliJ IDEA editor, you notice   that some constructors and methods are written with a strikethrough font. This means  that they are deprecated and might be removed in future versions of Java and thus they  should not be used. That is why there is another way to do all of that: use the  java.util. Calendar class. The code to do the same as before, but using the Calendar class is listed  next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import java.util.Calendar; import java.util.Date; import java.util.GregorianCalendar; import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;  public class CalendarDateDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat "dd-MM-yyyy" ;         Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar  ;         Date currentDate = calendar.getTime  ;         System.out.println "Today: " + sdf.format currentDate  ;          calendar.set 1977, 9, 16 ;         Date johnBirthday = calendar.getTime  ;         System.out.println "John’s Birthday: " + sdf.format johnBirthday  ;          int day = calendar.get Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH ;         System.out.println "Day: " + day ;         int month = calendar.get Calendar.MONTH ;         System.out.println "Month: " + month ;         in year = calendar.get Calendar.YEAR ;         System.out.println "Year: " + year ;     } }  Unfortunately some of the peculiarities remain, as the central class for representing   dates is still the java.util.Date, but at least we are not using anything deprecated  anymore.  194   Chapter 5    Data types  The java.util.Date class and the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class are not  thread safe, so in complex applications with multiple execution threads, developers  must synchronize access to those type of objects explicitly. Objects of those types are not  immutable, and working with time zones is a pain. That is why in Java 8, a new API to  model calendar-date operations was introduced. It is better designed, and date instances  are thread-safe and immutable. The central classes for the API are java.time.LocalDate  and java.time.LocalDateTime, used to model calendar dates and calendar dates with  time. Let’s see how the code to get the current date and to create a custom date looks  with the new API.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import java.time.LocalDate; import java.time.LocalDateTime; import java.time.Month;  public class CalendarDateDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         LocalDateTime currentTime = LocalDateTime.now  ;         System.out.println "Current DateTime: " + currentTime ;         LocalDate today = currentTime.toLocalDate  ;         System.out.println "Today: " + today ;          LocalDate johnBd = LocalDate.of 1977, Month.OCTOBER, 16 ;         System.out.println "John’s Birthday: " + johnBd ;          int day = johnBd.getDayOfMonth  ;         System.out.println "Day: " + day + ", " + johnBd.getDayOfWeek   ;         int month = johnBd.getMonthValue  ;         System.out.println "Month: " + month + ", " + johnBd.getMonth   ;         int year = johnBd.getYear  ;         System.out.println "Year: " + year ;     } }  To get the current date and time a static method named now   is called, which   returns an instance of type LocalDateTime. This instance can get the current date by  calling toLocalDate  .  195   Chapter 5    Data types  To create a custom date, the actual year and day of month can be used as parameters   and the month can be specified using one of the values of the java.time.Month enum. Extracting information regarding a date can be done easily by calling methods with   intuitive names. Look at the getDayOfMonth   and getDayOfWeek   methods in the  previous snippet. Their name reflects exactly what data they are returning.  The LocalDate and LocalDateTime classes simplify the development where time   zones are not required. Working with time zones is an advanced subject, so it won’t be  covered in this book.   Collections Among the most important family types in JDK are collections. Classes and interfaces  in the collections family model common data collections, such as sets, lists, and maps.  All the classes are stored under package java.util and can be split into two categories:  tuples and collections of key-value pairs. The tuples are unidimensional sets of data: if  the values are unique, any class implementing the java.util.Set interface should be  used to model them, if not any class implementing the java.util.List interface should  be used. For collections of key-value pairs classes, implementations of java.util.Map  should be used.  Starting with Java 1.5 collections have become generic, which allows developers   more precision and security when working with them. Before Java 1.5, collections could  contain any type of objects. Developers can still write code like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Gender; import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  import java.util.*;  public class CollectionsDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         List objList = new ArrayList  ;         objList.add "temp" ;         objList.add Integer.valueOf 5  ;         objList.add new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE  ;     } }  196   Chapter 5    Data types  When you iterate this list, it is difficult to determine which objects you are handling  without complicated code analyzing the type of each object. This was mentioned at the  end of Chapter 4 when generics were introduced. The code to iterate the list and process  the elements is depicted next to show you why this is a bad idea and bad practice in this  day and age of Java.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Gender; import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Performer;  import java.util.*;  public class CollectionsDemo {      public static void main String... args  {        List objList = new ArrayList  ;         objList.add "temp" ;         objList.add Integer.valueOf 5  ;         objList.add new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE  ;          for  Object obj : objList  {             if  obj instanceof String  {                 System.out.println "String object = " + obj.toString   ;             } else if  obj instanceof Integer  {                 Integer i =  Integer obj;                 System.out.println "Integer object = " + obj.toString   ;             } else {                 Performer p =  Performer  obj;                 System.out.println "Performer object = " +  p.getName   ;             }        }     } }  Maybe this is not clear to you now, but to use the contents of the list, you have to   know all the types of objects that were put in the list. This might be doable when you are  working on a small project, but in a bigger project with multiple developers involved,  this can get messy really fast.  197   Chapter 5    Data types  This is where generics come to help. Generics help define at compile time what  types of objects should be put into a collection, and thus, if the wrong object type is  added to the collection, the code no longer compiles. Both lists and sets implement the  same interface: java.util.Collection , which means their API is almost the same.  Figure 5-18 shows a simplified hierarchy of the collections with the most used classes  and interfaces in programming Figure 5-18.  Figure 5-18.  Collection hierarchy  Let’s start with a list example.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import java.util.*;  public class CollectionsDemo {  198   Chapter 5    Data types      public static void main String... args  {         List  stringList = new ArrayList   ;         stringList.add "one" ;         stringList.add "two" ;         stringList.add "three" ;          for  String s : stringList  {             System.out.println s ;         }     } }  A List contains an unsorted collection of non-unique data, null elements   included. In the example, we declared a reference of type List  and an object of type  ArrayList . We did this because as all implementations have the same API, we could  easily switch ArrayList  with LinkedList  and the code still works. Declaring  abstract references is a good programming practice.  List  stringList = new ArrayList   ; stringList = new LinkedList   ;  The syntax in the previous examples are pre-Java 1.7, when the    diamond   operator  was introduced. This allowed more simplification of collections initializations,  because it only required declaring the type of the elements in the list only in the  reference declaration. So, the two lines in the previous code snippet became  List  stringList = new ArrayList   ; stringList = new LinkedList   ;  Every new Java version has added changes to the collection framework starting with   Java 1.5. In Java 1.8, support for lambda expressions was added with a default method  named forEach in the java.lang.Iterable  interface, which is extended by the java. lang.Collection . So, the code to print all the values in the list, as we did previously  using a for loop, can be replaced with  stringList.forEach element -> System.out.println element  ;  199   Chapter 5    Data types  In Java 9, yet another improvement was introduced: factory methods for collections.   Our collection was populated with elements by repeatedly calling add .. , which is a  little redundant, especially since we have the full collection of elements we want to put in  the list. That is why in Java 9 methods to create collection objects in one line of code were  introduced; for example,  List  stringList = List.of "one", "two", "three" ;  The resulting List  is an immutable collection; it can no longer be modified, and   elements cannot be added or removed from it.  Moving closer to the present, in Java 10, support for local variable type inference   was added, which means that we no longer have to explicitly specify the reference  type, because it is automatically be inferred based on the object type, so the following  declaration  List  stringList = List.of "one", "two", "three" ;  becomes  var stringList = List.of "one", "two", "three" ;  Similar code can be written with Set , HashSet , and TreeSet , and similar   methods exist for the Set  classes.  Map implementations come with a few differences because they model collections of  key-value pairs; so this case is treated separately. The following code snippet depicts the  creation, initialization of a map that uses keys of type String and values of type Integer.  The syntax is Java 6.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import java.util.*;  public class CollectionsDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         Map  stringMap = new HashMap   ;         stringMap.put "one", 1 ;         stringMap.put "two", 2 ;         stringMap.put "three", 3 ;  200   Chapter 5    Data types          for  Map.Entry  entry : stringMap.entrySet    {             System.out.println entry.getKey   + ":  " + entry.getValue   ;         }     } }  From the for loop, you can infer that a map is a collection of Map.Entry    elements. If we were to move ahead to the Java 1.7 syntax, the declaration of the map  changes to  Map  stringMap = new HashMap   ;  In Java 1.8, traversal and printing values in maps became more practical.  stringMap.forEach  k,v  -> System.out.println k + ": " + v  ;  And in Java 9, declaring and populating a map became easier.  Map  stringMap = Map.of "one", 1,"two", 2, "three", 3 ;  And local variable type inference works for maps too.  var stringMap = new HashMap   ;  The JDK classes for working with collections, cover a wide range of functionality,  such as sorting, searching, merging collections, intersections, and so on. As the book  advances, the context of the code samples widen, and we are able to use collections to  solve real-life problems. So, other methods are covered and working code samples are  provided.   Concurrency Specific Types A Java program can have more than one execution thread. By default, when a Java  program is executed, a thread is created for the code that is called from the main method  and a few other utility threads are created and executed in parallel for JVM related  things. These threads can easily be accessed using static utility methods defined in  the java.lang.Thread class. The following code sample does just that: extracts the  references to the Thread instances and prints their name in the console.  201   Chapter 5    Data types  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ListJvmThreads {     public static void main String... args  {         var threadSet = Thread.getAllStackTraces  .keySet  ;         var threadArray = threadSet.toArray new Thread[threadSet.size  ] ;          for  int i = 0; i < threadArray.length; ++i  {             System.out.println "thread name: " + threadArray[i].getName   ;         }     } }  The output produced by running the code in JDK 11 prints the following.  thread name: Reference Handler thread name: Monitor Ctrl-Break thread name: Finalizer thread name: main thread name: Signal Dispatcher thread name: Common-Cleaner  The thread named main is the thread that executes the developer written code. The   developer can write code to start its own threads from the main thread. The simplest way  to create a custom thread is to create a class that extends the Thread class. The Thread  class implements an interface named Runnable that declares a single method named  run  . The Thread class declares a method named start  . When this method is called,  the body of the run   method is executed in a separate execution thread.5 Thus, when  extending the Thread class, the run   method must be overridden.  The following example depicts a class named CounterThread. The contents of   the run   method is designed to pause the execution from time to time by calling the  Thread.sleep ..  utility method. The body of the method is wrapped in two lines  of code that print the name of the thread and a starting message and the name of the  thread and an ending message. This is necessary to slow down the execution of this type  of thread, so that we can clearly see they are executed in parallel.  5 Sure, the internal of thread management is much more complicated, but this section scratches  the surface.  202   Chapter 5    Data types  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class CounterThread extends Thread {     @Override     public void run   {         System.out.println this.getName   + " started..." ;         for  int i = 0; i < 10; ++i  {             try {                 Thread.sleep i * 10 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {                 e.printStackTrace  ;             }         }         System.out.println this.getName   + " ended." ;     } }  To test our thread class is as simple as instantiating it a few times and calling the   start   method.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class ThreadDemo {     public static void main String... args  {          for  int i = 0; i < 10; ++i  {             new CounterThread  .start  ;         }     } }  In the example, ten instances of class CounterThread were created and the start     method was called for each of them. When the previous code is executed, a log similar to  the following should print in the console.  Thread-0 started... Thread-3 started... Thread-8 started... Thread-9 started...  203   Chapter 5    Data types  Thread-7 started... Thread-6 started... Thread-1 started... Thread-2 started... Thread-4 started... Thread-5 started... Thread-4 ended. Thread-1 ended. Thread-9 ended. Thread-7 ended. Thread-5 ended. Thread-8 ended. Thread-0 ended. Thread-6 ended. Thread-2 ended. Thread-3 ended.  Another way to create threads is by creating a class that implements the Runnable  interface. This is useful when we want to customize the execution in the run method a  little more and maybe extend another class. Or, considering that the Runnable declares  one method, lambda expressions can be used too. Let’s declare the equivalent Runnable  implementation.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  import  static  java.lang.Thread.*;  public class CounterRunnable implements Runnable {     @Override     public void run   {         System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + " started..." ;         for  int i = 0; i < 10; ++i  {             try {                 Thread.sleep i * 10 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {                 e.printStackTrace  ;             }  204   Chapter 5    Data types          }         System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + " ended." ;     } }  Because we no longer have access to the name of the thread, to print it we must use   another utility method Thread.currentThread   to retrieve a reference to the current  thread in execution. The Thread class provides a constructor with a parameter of type  Runnable, this means it can be called with any argument of a type that implements  Runnable. And thus, to create threads using CounterRunnable, code similar to the  following example can be written.  package com.apress.bgn.ch5;  public class LambdaRunnableDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         for  int i = 0; i < 10; ++i  {            new Thread new CounterRunnable   .start  ;         }     } }  If this code is run, we’ll get a similar output. This is a good candidate for using lambda expressions, because Runnable can be   implemented on the spot. So, the previous code can also be written as follows.  for  int i = 0; i < 10; ++i  {            new Thread               Runnable implemented on the spot               -> {                System.out.println currentThread  .getName   + " started..." ;                for  int j = 0; j < 10; ++j  {                    try {                        sleep j * 10 ;                    } catch  InterruptedException e  {                        e.printStackTrace  ;                    }                }  205   Chapter 5    Data types                 System.out.println currentThread  .getName   + " ended." ;            } .start  ;      }  Java provides thread management classes that can create and manage threads, so  the developer mustn’t declare the threads explicitly. The concurrency framework is a  subject too advanced for this book, but if this section has made you curious, the Oracle  Concurrency tutorial is at https:  docs.oracle.com javase tutorial essential  concurrency index.html.   Summary In this chapter, you learned how memory for a Java program is administered by the JVM  and the basics of the most used Java data types. We discussed the following.     how the memory is managed during the execution of a Java program      the differences between primitive and reference types     how many primitive types are defined in Java     why the String type is special     how to work with calendar dates     how arrays are declared and used     how null is used     how to declare and use collection implementations  If some of the examples in this chapter seem complicated, do not be discouraged.  It is difficult to explain certain concepts without providing working code that you can  execute, test, and even modify yourself. Unfortunately, this requires the use of concepts  introduced in later chapters  e.g., for and if statements . Make a note of every concept  that it is not clear now, and the page number, and return to this chapter after you read  about the concept in more detail later in the book.  206   CHAPTER 6  Operators  The previous chapters covered the basic concepts of Java programming. You were taught  how to organize your code, how your files should be named, and which data types you  can use, depending on the problem you are trying to solve. You were taught how to  declare fields, variables, and methods and how they were stored in memory to help you  design your solutions so that resource consumption is optimal.  In this chapter, you learn to combine declared variables using operators. Most Java  operators are the ones you know from math, but because programming involves types  other than numeric, extra operators with specific purposes were added. Table 6-1 lists all  Java operators with their category and scope.  Table 6-1.

The Assignment Operator  =  This operator is the most used in programming, as nothing can be done without it. Any  variable that you create, regardless of the type, primitive or reference has to be given a  value at some point in the program. Setting of a value using the assignment operator is  quite simple: on the left side of the operator you have the variable name and on the right  it is a value. The only condition for an assignment to work is that the value matches the  type of the variable.  208   To test this operator, you can play a little using jshell; make sure that you start it in   verbose mode so you can see the effect of your assignments.  ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  $ jshell -v   Welcome to JShell -- Version 11-ea   For an introduction type:  help intro [jshell> int i = 0; i  ==> 0  created variable i : int  [jshell> i = -4; i ==> -4   assigned to i : int  jshell> String sample = "text" [sample ==> "text"   created variable sample : String  [jshell> List  list = new ArrayList    list ==> []   created variable list : List   [jshell> list = new LinkedList   ; list ==> []   assigned to list : List   In the previous example, we declared primitive and reference values and assigned   and reassigned values to them. Assignment of values with types that mismatch the initial  type is not permitted. In the following code sample, we are trying to assign a text value to  a variable that was previously declared as having the int type.  [jshell> int i = 0; i ==> 0   created variable i : int  [jshell> i = -4; i ==> -4   assigned to i : int  209   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  [jshell> i = "gigi pedala"   Error:   incompatible types: java.lang.String cannot be converted to int   i = "gigi pedala"       ^-----------^  Introduction of type inference in JDK 10 does not affect this, and the type of the   variable is inferred depending on the type of the first value assigned. This means that  you cannot declare a variable using the var keyword without specifying an initial value.  This excludes the null value, as it cannot be used to declare a type. This can be forced  though by casting the null value to the type we are interested in.  [jshell> var j;   Error:   cannot infer type for local variable j      cannot use ’var’ on variable without initializer    var j;   ^----^  [jshell> var j = 5; j ==> 5   created variable j : int  [jshell> var sample2 = "bubulina" sample2 ==> "bubulina"   created variable sample2 : String     yes, this actually works ! [jshell> var funny =  Integer  null; funny ==> null   created variable funny : Integer  210  This is all that can be said about the assignment operator. Other details are covered   later with the composed assignment operators.   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs   Explicit Type Conversion  type  and instanceof We coupled these two operators in the same section, because it is easier to provide code  samples that are identical to what you use frequently in your job as a developer.  should  you decide to go in this direction .  It is better to keep the reference type as generic as possible to allow changing of the  concrete implementation without breaking the code, but sometimes, we might need to  group objects together, but execute different code depending of their types. Remember  the Performer hierarchy mentioned in the previous chapter? We’re going to make use of  these types here to show you how to use these operators. In case you do not want to go  back to the previous chapter to see the hierarchy, 6-1 here it is again in Figure 6-1, but  with a twist: we added an extra class named Graphician, which implements the Artist  interface and extends the Human class.1  Figure 6-1.  The Performer hierarchy  In the following code sample, an object of type Musician and one of type Graphician   are created and both are added into a list containing references of type Artist. We can  do this because, both types implement the interface Artist.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  import com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.*;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List;  1 The implementation of the new class is not relevant for this chapter, so it won’t be detailed here.  211   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  public class OperatorDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         List  artists = new ArrayList   ;          Musician john = new Performer "John", 40, 1.91f, Gender.MALE ;         List  songs = List.of "Gravity" ;         john.setSongs songs ;         artists.add john ;           Graphician diana = new Graphician "Diana", 23, 1.62f, Gender.  FEMALE, "macOs" ; artists.add diana ;          for  Artist artist : artists  {             if  artist instanceof Musician  { \\  *                  Musician musician =  Musician  artist; \\ **                  System.out.println "Songs: " + musician.getSongs   ;             } else {                 System.out.println "Other Type: " + artist.getClass   ;             }         }     } }  The line marked with  *  shows how to use the instanceof operator. This operator   tests whether the object is an instance of the specified type.  class, subclass or interface .  It is used in writing conditions to decide which code block should be executed.  The line marked with  **  does an explicit conversion of an reference. Since the   instanceof operator helped figure out that the object the reference points to is of type  Musician, we can now convert the reference to the proper type so methods of class  Musician can be called.  But what happens if an explicit conversion fails? For this we try to convert the   previously declared Graphician reference to Musician. So, we’ll add the following line.  Musician fake =  Musician  diana;  212   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  The compiler won’t complain, but this does not change the fact that Graphician  has no relation to the Musician type, so the code will not run, and a special exception  is thrown in the console to tell you what went wrong. The error message printed in the  console is explicit and is depicted in the next log snippet.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException:   chapter.six com.apress.bgn.ch6.Graphician cannot be cast to   chapter.four com.apress.bgn.ch4.hierarchy.Musician          at chapter.six com.apress.bgn.ch6.OperatorDemo.mainOperatorDemo.java:24  The message clearly states that the two types are not compatible and the package   and module names are included.  But explicit conversion is not limited to reference types, it works for primitives too.   Any variable of a type with values in a smaller interval can be converted to a type of  a bigger interval, without explicit conversion. But the reverse is possible too by using  explicit conversion, but if the value is too big, bits is lost and the value is... unexpected.  Look at the following examples of conversions between byte and int.  [jshell> byte b = 2; b ==> 2   created variable b : byte  [jshell> int i = 10; i ==> 10   created variable i : int  [jshell> i = b i ==> 2   assigned to i : int  [jshell> b = i   Error:   incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte   b = i       ^  213   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  [jshell> b =  byte  i b ==> 2    all good, because value is in byte interval   assigned to b : byte  [jshell> i = 300000 i ==> 300000   assigned to i : int  [jshell> b =  byte  i b ==> -32     oops! value outside byte interval   assigned to b : byte  So, as a general rule, use explicit conversion to widen the scope of a variable, not to   narrow it, as narrowing it can lead to unexpected results.   Numerical Operators This section groups all operators that are mostly used on numerical types. The numerical  operators you know from math: +, -,  . Comparators are found in programming too, but  they can be combined to obtain different effects.   Unary Operators Unary operators require only one operand, and they affect the variable they are  applied to.   Incrementors and Decrementors  In Java and some other programming languages  there are unary operator called  incrementors  ++  and decrementors  -- . These operators are placed before or after a  variable to increase or decrease its value by 1. They are usually used in loops as counters  to condition the termination of the loop. When they are placed before the variable, they  are called prefixed and when are placed after it they are called postfixed.  When they are prefixed, the operation is executed on the variable, before the variable   is used in the next statement. The following code sample tests this affirmation.  214   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class UnaryOperatorsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         int i  = 1;         int j = ++i;         System.out.println "j is " + j + ", i is " + i ;     } }  The expected result of the preceding code is that j=2, because the value of the i   variable is modified to 2, before it is assigned to j. Thus, the expected output is j is 2,  i is 2.  When they are postfixed, the operation is executed on the variable, after the variable   is used in the next statement. The following code sample tests this affirmation.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class UnaryOperatorsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         i = 1;         j = i++;         System.out.println "j is " + j + ", i is " + i ;     } }  The expected result of the preceding code is that j=1, because the value of the i   variable is modified to 2, after it is assigned to j. Thus, the expected output is j is 1,   i is 2.  The decrementor operator can be used in a similar manner, the only effect is that the  variable is decreased by 1. Try to modify the UnaryOperatorsDemo to use the -- operator  instead.   Sign Operators  int i = 3;  Mathematical operator + is used on a single operator to indicate that a number is  positive redundant and mostly never used . So basically,  215   Mathematical operator - declares negative numbers.  ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  Is the same as  int i = +3;  [jshell> int i = -3 i ==> -3   created variable i : int  Or it negates an expression.  [jshell> int i = -3 i ==> -3   created variable i : int  [jshell> int j = -   i + 4   j ==> -1   created variable j : int  As you can see in the example, the result of the   i + 4   is 1, because i = -3,   but because of the - in front of the parentheses, the final result that is assigned to the j  variable is -1.   Negation Operator  There are two more unary operators, and their role is to negate variables. Operator !  applies to boolean variables, and it is used to negate them. So, true becomes false and  false becomes true.  [jshell> boolean t = true t ==> true   created variable t : boolean  [jshell> boolean f = !t f ==> false   created variable f : boolean  [jshell> boolean t2 = !f t2 ==> true   created variable t2 : boolean  216   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs   Binary Operators Let’s start with the ones you probably know from math.     + adds two variables  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   created variable i : int  [jshell> int j = 6 j ==> 6   created variable j : int  [jshell> int k = i + j k ==> 10   created variable k : int  [jshell> int i = i + 2 i ==> 6   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  The last statement int i = i + 2 has the effect of incrementing the value of  i with 2 and there is a little redundancy there. That statement can be written  without mentioning i twice, because its effect is to increase the value of i  with 2. This can be done by using the += operator, which is composed of the  assignment and the addition operator. The optimal statement is i += 2.  The + operator can also be used to concatenate String instances, or String  instances with other types. The JVM decides how to use the + operator  depending on the context. Let’s look at the following example.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class ConcatenationDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         int i1 = 0;         int i2 = 1;         int i3 = 2;  217   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs          System.out.println i1 + i2 + i3 ;         System.out.println "Result1 = " +  i1 + i2  + i3 ;         System.out.println "Result2 = " + i1 + i2 + i3 ;         System.out.println "Result3 = " +  i1 + i2 + i3  ;     } }  If the preceding code executed the following is displayed in the console.  1.   3 2.   Result1 = 12 3.   Result2 = 012 4.   Result3 = 3  I’ll explain.   – The result in line 1 can be explained as follows: because all   operands are of type int JVM adds the terms as normal and the  println function prints this result.   – The result in line 2 can be explained as follows: parentheses   were added to isolate the addition of two terms  i1+i2 .  Because of this, the JVM executes the addition between the  parentheses as a normal addition between to int terms. But  after that, what we are left with is "Result1 = " + 1 + i3, and  this operation includes a String operand, which means the +  operator must be used as a concatenation operator, because  adding a number with a text value does not work otherwise.   – The result in line 3 should be obvious at this time; we have three  int operands, and a String operand, and thus the JVM decides  that the context of the operation cannot be numeric, so concat- enation is required.   – The result in line 4 can be explained in a similar way as line 2;   the parentheses are used to ensure that the context of the  operation is numeric, and thus the three operands are added.  218   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  This is a typical example to show how JVM decides the context for operations  involving the + operator that you might find in other Java tutorials as well.  But the int variables can be replaced with float or double variables and the  behavior is similar.      - subtracts two variables, or subtracts a value from a variable. The  following shows how this operator and the -= operator, which is  composed of the assignment and the subtraction operator, are used.  [jshell> int i = 4; i ==> 4   created variable i : int  [jshell> int j = 2; j ==> 2   created variable j : int  [jshell> int k = i – j k ==> 2   created variable k : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i = i - 3; i ==> 1   assigned to i : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i -= 3 $9 ==> 1   created scratch variable $9 : int  219   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs      * multiplies two variables, or multiplies a value with a variable. It  is used in similar statements as + and -, and there is a composed  operator *= that can be used to multiply the value of a variable and  assign it on the spot.  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   created variable i : int  [jshell> int j = 2 j ==> 2   created variable j : int  [jshell> int k =    i * j k ==> 8   created variable k : int  [jshell> int i = 4; i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i = i * 3 i ==> 12   assigned to i : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i *= 3 $7 ==> 12   created scratch variable $7 : int  220   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs        divides two variables, or divides a value by a variable. It is used in  similar statements as + and -, and there is a composed operator  =  that can be used to divide the value of a variable and assign it on the  spot. The result of a division is named quotient and it is assigned to  the variable on the left side of the assignment sign "=" . When the  operands are integers, the result is an integer too, and the remainder  is discarded.  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   created variable i : int  [jshell> int j = 2 j ==> 2   created variable j : int  [jshell> int k = i   j k ==> 2   created variable k : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> int i = i   3 i ==> 1   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i  = 3 $7 ==> 1   created scratch variable $7 : int  221   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs      % is also called the modulus operator divides two variables, but  the result is the remainder of the division. The operation is called  modularization and there is also a composed operator %= that is used  to divide the value of a variable and assign the remainder on the spot.  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   created variable i : int  [jshell> int j = 3 j ==> 3   created variable j : int  [jshell> int k = i % j k ==> 1   created variable k : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i = i % 3 i ==> 1   assigned to i : int  [jshell> int i = 4 i ==> 4   modified variable i : int     update overwrote variable i : int  [jshell> i %= 3 $7 ==> 1   created scratch variable $7 : int  The modulus operator returns the remainder, but, what happens when the operands   are real numbers? And what if the remainder is a real number with an infinite numbers  of decimals after the decimal point?  222   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class ModulusDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         float f = 1.9f;         float g = 0.4f;         float h = f % g;         System.out.println "remainder = " + h ;     } }  Well, some rounding is done. The text printed in the console is remainder = 0.29999995  which can be rounded to 0.3, for some cases. But rounding can be dangerous when the data  is used for sensitive operations, like determining the volume of a  tumor for a robot to operate  on, or determining the perfect trajectory for a rocket to be sent to Mars. So, rounding can be  problematic, because it causes a loss of precision.   Relational Operators In certain cases, when designing the solution for a problem, you need to introduce  conditions to drive and control the execution flow. Conditions require the evaluation  of a comparison between two terms using a comparison operator. In this section all  comparison operators used in java is described and code samples is provided. Let’s  proceed.      == tests equality of terms. Because in Java a single equals  =  sign  assigns values, a solution needed to be find to test equality, so the  developers just duplicated the “=” operator. We have used for  loops before to depict how to use certain types or statements, even  if they are to be covered only in the next chapter, because the code  samples presented to you should be compliable and runnable. In  the following code sample, you see an example of testing the ==  comparator in searching for value 2 in an array. If the value is found,  the index is printed in the console.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class ComparisonOperatorsDemo {  223   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs      public static void main String... args  {         int[] values = {1, 7, 9, 2, 6,};          for  int i = 0; i < values.length; ++i  {             if  values[i] == 2  { \\ *                  System.out.println "Fount 2 at index: " + i ;             }         }     } }  The condition in the line marked with  *  is evaluated and the  result is a boolean value. When the result is false, nothing is  done, but if the result is true the index is printed. Because the  result is of type boolean, if you make a mistake and instead you  use = instead of ==, the code will not compile. You have to be extra  careful when comparing boolean values though.  The == sign works just fine for primitives; for reference types, you  need to use the equals   method that was covered in Chapter 5.              != tests inequality of terms. It is the opposite of the == operator. As an  exercise, modify the previous example to print a message when the  array value is not 2. This operator also works on reference types. But  if you want to test inequality of references values you have to use an  expression similar to: !a.equals b   < and <= have the same purpose as the one you probably learned in  math class. The first one  <  tests if the item on the left of the operator  is less than the one on the right. The next one  <=  tests if the item on  the left of the operator is less or equal to the one on the right. This  operator cannot be used on reference types.  > and >= have the same purpose as the one you probably learned in  math class. The first one  >  tests if the item on the left of the operator  is greater than the one on the right. The next one  >=  tests if the item  on the left of the operator is greater or equal to the one on the right.  This operator cannot be used on reference types.  224   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  Almost all numeric operators can be used on variables of different primitive  and  wrapper  types, as they are automatically converted to type that has a wider interval  representation or unboxed to the appropriate type in the case of wrapper types. The  following code reflects a few situations, but in practice, you might need to make  even more extreme decisions that do not always abide to the common-sense rules of  programming or follow good practices.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class MixedOperationsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b = 1;         short s = 2;         int i = 3;         long l = 4;          float f = 5;         double d = 6;         int ii = 6;          double resd = l + d;         long  resl = s + 3;           etc          if  b <= s  {             System.out.println "byte val < short val" ;         }          if  i >= b  {             System.out.println "int val >= byte val" ;         }          if  l > b  {             System.out.println "long val > byte val" ;         }          if d > i  {            System.out.println "double val > byte val" ;         }  225   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs          if i == i  {            System.out.println "double val == int val" ;         }     } }  Make sure that if you are ever in a situation where you need to make shady things    non-optimal code constructs  like these to test a lot, and think about your conversions  well, especially when floating-point types are involved, because, for example, the  following piece of code can have unexpected results.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class DecimalPointDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       float f1 = 2.2f;         float f2 = 2.0f;         float f3 = f1 * f2;         if  f3 == 4.4  {             System.out.println "expected float value of 4.4" ;         } else {             System.out.println "unexpected value of " + f3 ;         }     } }  If you expect the message expected float value of 4.4 to be printed in the console, you   will be surprised. Any IEEE 754 floating-point number representation presents issues  because some numbers that appear to have a fixed number of decimals in the decimal  system actually have an infinite number of decimals in the binary system. So, we cannot  compare floats and doubles using ==. One of the solutions that is easiest to implement is  to use the compare method provided by the wrapper class; in this case, Float.compare.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class DecimalPointDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       float f1 = 2.2f;         float f2 = 2.0f;  226   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs          float f3 = f1 * f2;         if  Float.compare f3,4.4f  == 0  {            System.out.println "expected float value of 4.4" ;         } else {            System.out.println "unexpected value of " + f3 ;        }     } }  Using the previous example, the expected message is now printed in the console:   expected float value of 4.4.   Bitwise Operators In Java there are a few operators that are used at bit level to manipulate variables of  numerical types. Bitwise operators are used to change individual bits in an operand.  Bitwise operations are faster and usually use less power because of the reduced use of  resources. They are most useful in programming visual applications, games, where color,  mouse clicks, and movements can be quickly determined using bitwise applications.   Bitwise NOT The ~ operator is sort of a binary negator. It performs a bit-by-bit reversal of an integer  value. Of course, this affects all bits used to represent the value. So, if we declare  byte b1 = 10;  the binary representation is 00001010. The Integer class provides a method named   toBinaryString that can print the binary representation of the previously defined  variable, but it won’t print all the bits, because the method doesn’t know on how many  bits we want the representation on. So, we need to use a special String function to  format the output. The following code snippet prints the b value in binary on 8 bits.  System.out.println "decimal:" + b1 ; String str = String.format "%8s", Integer.toBinaryString b1 & 0xFF           .replace ' ', '0' ; System.out.println "binary:" + str ;  227   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  If we apply the ~ operator on the b value, the binary value resulted is 11110101. The  fist bit is the sign bit, and value one corresponds to -. So, the number is –11, as displayed  in the following code.  byte b2 =  byte  ~b1; System.out.println "decimal:" + b2 ; String str2 = String.format "%8s", Integer.toBinaryString b2 & 0xFF             .replace ' ', '0' ; System.out.println "binary:" + str2 ;  In the previous example, you probably noticed this statement:  byte b2 =  byte  ~b1  You are expecting an explanation. The bitwise complement expression operator  requires an operand that is convertible to a primitive integral type, or a compile time  error occurs. Internally, Java uses one or more bytes to represent values. The ~ operator  converts its operand to the int type, so it can use 32-bits when doing the complement  operation; this is needed to avoid loss of precision. That is why an explicit cast to byte is  needed in the previous example.  And because everything is clearer with images, Figure 6-2 shows the effect of the ~ on   the bits of the b1 variable in parallel with its value.  Figure 6-2.  The effect of the operator on every bit   Bitwise AND The bitwise AND operator is represented by & and what is does is to compare two  numbers bit by bit and if the bits on each position have the value of 1, the bit in the result  is 1. The following code sample, depicts the result of the & operator.  228   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class BitwiseDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b1 = 117;    01110101         byte b2 = 95;    01011111          byte result =  byte   b1 &  b2 ;    01010101          System.out.println "b1:"+ b1 ;         System.out.println "b2:"+ b2 ;         System.out.println "---------" ;          String str = String.format "%8s", Integer.toBinaryString result &   0xFF                 .replace '  ', '0' ;         System.out.println "result:" + result ;         System.out.println "binary result:" + str ;     } }  We are using the same String.format ..  method to display the bits of the result of   applying the & to the b1 and b2 operators. The preceding code prints the following.  b1:117 b2:95 --------- result:85 binary result:01010101  But the effect of the & operator is seen best in Figure 6-3. The 01010101 value is the   binary representation of number 85.  Figure 6-3.  The effect of the & operator on every bit  229   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  For practical reasons, the composed operator &= is available in Java, so that the   bitwise AND operation can be done on the same variable on which the result is assigned.  [jshell> byte b1 = 10 b1 ==> 10   created variable b1 : byte  [jshell> b1 &= 2 $2 ==> 2   created scratch variable $2 : byte   Bitwise Inclusive OR The bitwise OR operator is represented by  and what is does is to compare two numbers  bit by bit and if at least one of the bits is 1, the bit in the result is 1. The following code  sample, depicts the result of the  operator.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class BitwiseDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b1 = 117;    01110101         byte b2 = 95;    01011111          byte result =  byte   b1  b2 ;     01111111          System.out.println "b1:"+ b1 ;         System.out.println "b2:"+ b2 ;         System.out.println "---------" ;          String str = String.format "%8s", Integer.toBinaryString    result & 0xFF                 .replace ' ', '0' ;         System.out.println "result: " + result ;         System.out.println "binary result: " + str ;     } }  230   We are using the same String.format ..  method to display the bits of the result of   applying the  to the b1 and b2 operators.

[jshell> byte b1 = 10 b1 ==> 10   created variable b1 : byte  [jshell> b1 = 2 $4 ==> 10   created scratch variable $4 : byte   Bitwise Exclusive OR The bitwise XOR operator is represented by ^ and what is does is to compare two  numbers bit by bit and if the values are different, the bit in the result is 1. The following  code sample, depicts the result of the ^ operator.  231   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  public class BitwiseDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b1 = 117;    01110101         byte b2 = 95;    01011111          byte result =  byte   b1 ^ b2 ;     00101010          System.out.println "b1:"+ b1 ;         System.out.println "b2:"+ b2 ;         System.out.println "---------" ;          String str = String.format "%8s", Integer.toBinaryString    result & 0xFF                 .replace '  ', '0' ;         System.out.println "result: " + result ;         System.out.println "binary result: " + str ;     } }  We are using the same String.format ..  method to display the bits of the result of   applying the ^ to the b1 and b2 operators.

There are four operators that are used to construct  complex conditions; two of them are bitwise operations that can be reused: & AND   and  OR ; but they require evaluation of all the parts of the condition. The operators  && AND  and  OR  have the same effect as the other ones, but the difference is they do  not require evaluation of all the expression, which is why they are also called shortcut  operators. To explain the difficult behavior of these operators, there is a typical example.  Basically, we declare a list of ten terms  some of them null  and a method to generate a  random index, used to select an item from the list. Then we test the selected element from  the list to see if it is not null and equal to an expected value. If both conditions are true,  then a message is printed in the console. Let’s start with the first example.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random;  public class LogicalDemo {     static List  terms = new ArrayList    {{         add "Rose" ;         add null ;         add "River" ;         add "Clara" ;         add "Vastra" ;  233   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs          add "Psi" ;         add "Cas" ;         add null ;         add "Nardhole" ;         add "Strax" ;     }};      public static void main String... args  {         for  int i = 0; i < 20; ++i  {             int rnd = getRandomNumber  ;             String term = terms.get rnd ;             System.out.println "Generated index: " + rnd ;             if  term != null & term.equals "Rose"   { \\ *                  System.out.println "Rose  was  found" ;             }         }     }      private static int getRandomNumber   {         Random r = new Random  ;         return r.nextInt 10 ;     } }  To make sure we get the expected result, we repeat the operation of selecting a   random term 20 times. In the line marked with  * , the & composes the two expressions.  So, the text "Rose was found" should be printed in the console only if the value of the  term variable is not null and equal to Rose. So, when the preceding code is run, expect to  see something like this in the console.  Generated index: 8 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException Generated index: 4         at chapter.six com.apress.bgn.ch6.LogicalDemo.mainLogicalDemo.java:57 Generated index: 7  But, think about it like this: if the term is null, should we even evaluate the equality   to “Rose”, especially since calling a method on a null object causes a runtime error?   234   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  Obviously not, which is why the & is not suitable for this case. If the term is null, it fails  the first condition; there is no point in evaluating the second. And so, enter the &&  shortcut operator that does exactly this. This works because when using the logical AND  operator, if the first term is false, it does not really matter what the second term is equal  to, the result is always false. So, we can correct the previous code sample as follows.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random;  public class LogicalDemo {     static List  terms = new ArrayList    {{         add "Rose" ;         add null ;         ..     }};      public static void main String... args  {         for  int i = 0; i < 20; ++i  {             int rnd = getRandomNumber  ;             String term = terms.get rnd ;             System.out.println "Generated index: " + rnd ;             if  term != null && term.equals "Rose"   { \\ *                  System.out.println "Rose  was  found" ;             }         }     }      private static int getRandomNumber   {         Random r = new Random  ;         return r.nextInt 10 ;     } }  So, when the preceding code is executed, no exception is thrown, because if the term   is null, the second condition is not evaluated.  235   Let’s modify the previous code sample, but this time, let’s print the message if we   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  find a null or if we find “Rose”.  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random;  public class LogicalDemo {     static List  terms = new ArrayList    {{         add "Rose" ;         add null ;         ..     }};      public static void main String... args  {         for  int i = 0; i < 20; ++i  {             int rnd = getRandomNumber  ;             String term = terms.get rnd ;             System.out.println "Generated index: " + rnd ;             if  term == null  term.equals "Rose"   { \\ *                  System.out.println "Rose  was  found" ;             }         }     }      private static int getRandomNumber   {         Random r = new Random  ;         return r.nextInt 10 ;     } }  If we run the previous code, the use of  throws a NullPointerException because   this operator requires both expressions to be evaluated. So, if term is null, calling  .equals ...  causes the exception to be thrown. So, to make sure that the code works  as expected, the  must be replaced with , which shortcuts the condition and does not  evaluate the second expression. This works because when using the logical OR operator,  if the first term is true, it does not really matter what the second term is equal to; the  result is always true. We’ll leave that as an exercise for you. 236   Of course, conditions can be made up from more than one expression and more   than one operator, whether it is && or . Take a look at the following examples.  ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  package com.apress.bgn.ch6;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random;  public class LogicalDemo {     static List  terms = new ArrayList    {{         add "Rose" ;         add null ;         ..     }};      public static void main String... args  {         for  int i = 0; i < 20; ++i  {             int rnd = getRandomNumber  ;             String term = terms.get rnd ;             if  rnd == 0  rnd == 1  rnd <= 3  {                 System.out.println rnd + ": this works..." ;             }              if  rnd > 3 && rnd   0  {                 System.out.println rnd + ": this works too..." ;             }         }     }      private static int getRandomNumber   {         Random r = new Random  ;         return r.nextInt 10 ;     } }  Beware of conditions that become too complex, make sure you cover that piece  of code with a lot of tests. When writing complex conditions it is possible that some  expressions become redundant, and IntelliJ IDEA and other smart editors display  warnings of dead code on expressions that are redundant and unused.  237    OpeRAtORs ChApteR 6   Shift Operators The shift operators are operators working at bit level. Because moving bits around is a  sensitive operation, the only requirement of these operands is for arguments to be integers.  The operand to the left of the operator is the number that is shifted, and the operand to the  right of the operator is the number of bits that is shifted. There are three shift operators in  Java, and each of them can be composed with the assignment operator to do the shifting and  assign the result to the original variable on the spot. Let’s analyze each of them separately.      << shift left. Given a number represented in binary, this operator  shifts bits to the left. Let’s look at the following piece of code.  public class ShiftDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b1 = 12;    00001100         byte result =  byte   b1 << 3 ;          str = String.format "%8s",  Integer.  toBinaryString result & 0xFF                 .replace ' ', '0' ;          System.out.println "result: " + result ;    01100000     } }  When bits are shifted to the left, the remaining positions are filled  with 0. Also, the number becomes bigger, and the new value is  its old value multiplied with −2N, where N is the second operand.  When the preceding code is executed, the following output is  printed in the console.  b1: 12 binary result: 00001100 result:  96 binary result: 01100000  The preceding code can be written like this: b <<= 3, using the  composed operators, without the need to declare another variable.  So, the result is 12 * 23. The way that the bits shifted is shown in  Figure 6-6.  238   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  Figure 6-6.  The effect of the « operator      >> shift right. Given a number represented in binary, this operator  shifts bits to the right. Let’s look at the following piece of code.  public class ShiftDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b1 = 96;    01100000         byte result =  byte   b1 >> 3 ;          str = String.format "%8s", Integer.  toBinaryString result & 0xFF                 .replace ' ', '0' ;         System.out.println "result: " + result ;    00001100     } }  When bits are shifted to the right, the remaining positions are  filled with 0 if the number is positive. If the number is negative,  the remaining positions are replaced with 1. This is done to  preserve the sign of the number. Also, the number becomes  smaller, and the new value is its old value divided by −2N, where N  is the second operand. When the preceding code is executed, the  following output is printed in the console.  b1: 96 binary result: 01100000 result: 12 binary result: 00001100  The preceding code can be written like this: b >>= 3, using  the composed operators, without the need to declare another  variable.  239   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  So, the result is 96   23. And the way that the bits shifted for a  positive number and a negative number is displayed in Figure 6-7.  Figure 6-7.  The effect of the » operator      >>> unsigned shift right. Also called logical shift. Given a number  represented in binary, this operator shifts bits to the right, together  with the sign bit, and the remaining positions are replaced with zero.  This is why, the result is always a positive number. Let’s look at the  following piece of code.  public class ShiftDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         byte b1 = -16;    11110000         byte result =  byte   b1 >>> 3 ;          str = String.format "%8s", Integer.  toBinaryString result & 0xFF                 .replace ' ', '0' ;         System.out.println "result: " + result ;    00011110     } }  When the preceding code is executed, the following output is  printed in the console.  b1: -16 binary result: 11110000 result:  30 binary result: 00011110  240   The preceding code can be written like this: b >>>= 3, using the  composed operators, without the need to declare another variable.  And the way that the bits shifted is displayed in Figure 6-8.  ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  Figure 6-8.  The effect of the > > > operator  As all bitwise operators, shifting operators promote char, byte, or short type   variables to int, which is why an explicit conversion is necessary. As you have probably  noticed, shifting bits on negative numbers is tricky, it is easy for the resulted number to  be outside the interval of allowed values for a type, and an explicit conversion can lead  to loss of precision or serious anomalies. So, why use them? Because they are fast. Make  sure to test intensively when using shifting operators.   The Elvis Operator The Elvis operator is the only ternary operator in Java. Its function is equivalent to a  java method that tests a condition and depending of the outcome, returns a value. The  following is a template for the Elvis operator.  variable =  condition  ? val1 : val2  The following if statement is equivalent.  variable = methodName ..   type methodName ..  {         if  condition  {                 return val1;         } else {                 return val2;         } }  The reason this operator is called the Elvis operator is because the question mark   resembles Elvis Presley’s hair, and the column resembles the eyes. Let’s see it in action.  241   ChApteR 6    OpeRAtORs  [jshell> int a = 4 a ==> 4   created variable a : int  [jshell> int result = a > 4 ? 3 : 1; result ==> 1   created variable result : int  [jshell> String a2 = "test" a2 ==> "test"   created variable a2 : String  [jshell> var a3 = a2.length   > 3 ? "hello": "bye-bye" a3 ==> "hello"   created variable a3 : String  This operator is practical when you have a simple if statement that contains only one   expression per branch, because using this operator you can compact the whole thing in  one expression, one line of code. Make sure that when using it, the readability of the code  is improved, because from a performance point of view, there is no difference between an  if statement and the equivalent Elvis operator expression. Another advantage of using the  Elvis operator is that the expression can initialize a variable in a single in-line statement.   Summary In this chapter, you learned that      Java has a lot of operators, simple and composed.     Bitwise operators are fast, but dangerous.     The + operator does different things in different contexts.      Java has a ternary operator that accepts three operands: a boolean  expression and two objects of the same type. The result of the  evaluation of the boolean expression decides which operand is the  result of the statement.  The purpose of this chapter is to make you familiar with all the operators that are   used throughout the book, to help you understand the provided solutions, and even to  design and write your own.  242   CHAPTER 7  Controlling the Flow  The previous chapters covered ways to create statements and which operators to use.  Sometimes, elements of logic were added to make the code runnable for you. This  chapter is dedicated to explain how to manipulate the execution of your code using  fundamental programming—conditional and repetitive statements.  A solution and an algorithm can be represented using flowcharts. Most of the   programming that we’ve done until this chapter contained declaration and printing  statements—simple one-step statements. Take the following piece of code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class Main {      public static void main String... args  {     String text = "sample";     System.out.println text ;     } }  If we were to design a flowchart for it, the schema would be simple and linear, no   decision and no repetition, as depicted in Figure 7-1.  Figure 7-1.  Simple flowchart sample    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_7  243   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  But resolving real-life problems requires often a more complicated logic than that,   so more complicated statements are necessary. Before getting into that, let’s describe the  components of a flowchart, because they will be used a lot during this chapter. Table 7-1  lists flowchart elements.  Table 7-1.  Flowchart Elements  Shape  Scope  Name  Terminal  Process  Decision  Indicates beginning or end of a program, and contains a  text relevant to its scope.  Flowline  Indicates the flow of the program, the order of operations.  Input Output  Indicates declaration of variables and outputting values.  Simple process statement: assignment, change of values,  and so forth.  Shows a conditional operation that decides a certain path  of execution.  Predefined Process This element indicates a process defined else-where.  On-page Connector This element is usually labeled and indicates the   continuation of the flow on the same page.  Off-page Connector This element is usually labeled and indicates the   continuation of the flow on a different page.  Comment  Or  annotation   When a flow or an element requires extra explanation it is  introduced using this type of element.  The flowchart elements presented in this table are pretty standard; you will probably   find very similar elements used in any programming course or tutorial. After this  consistent introduction, it is only fit to get into it.   if-else Statement The most simple decisional flow statement in Java is the if-else statement.  probably in  other languages too  You’ve probably seen the if-else statement in code samples in the  previous chapters. There was no way to avoid it, because providing runnable code that   244   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  encourages you to write your own is important. But in this section the focus is strictly on  this type of statement.  Let’s imagine this scenario: we run a Java program with a numeric argument   provided by the user. If the number is even, we print EVEN in the console; else, we print  ODD. The flowchart matching this scenario is depicted in Figure 7-2.  Figure 7-2.  if-else flowchart sample  The condition is evaluated to a boolean value, if the result is true the statement   corresponding to the if branch is executed, if the result is false, the statement  corresponding to the else branch is executed.  The Java code that implements the process described by this flowchart is depicted in   the following code snippet.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class IfFlowDemo {      public static void main String... args  {       Read a     int a = Integer.parseInt args0 ;      if  a % 2 == 0  {    is even           Display EVEN         System.out.println "EVEN" ;  245   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      } else {           Display ODD         System.out.println "ODD" ;     }     } }  To run this class with different arguments, you must create an IntelliJ IDEA launcher   and add your argument in the Program arguments text field, as explained at the  beginning of this book. Each Java statement in the previous code snippet was paired  with a comment matching the flowchart element to make the implementation clear.  The fun thing is that not both branches of an if statement are mandatory. Sometimes  you want to print something if a value matches a condition, but you are not interested  in what happens otherwise. For example, given a user provided argument, we want to  print a message if the number is negative, but we are not interested in printing or doing  anything else if the number is positive. The flowchart for that is depicted in Figure 7-3.  Figure 7-3.  if flowchart sample, missing the else branch  And the Java code looks like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class IfFlowDemo {      public static void main String... args  {       Read a     int a = Integer.parseInt args0 ;  246   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      if  a < 0  {         System.out.println "Negative" ;     }     } }  And in the same way that the statement can be made simple, in the same way, is   we need it, we can link more if-else statements together. Let’s consider the following  example: the user inserts a number from 1 to 12, and we have to print the season the  month with that number corresponds to. How would the flowchart look like? Do you  think Figure 7-4 fits the scenario?  Figure 7-4.  Complex if-else flowchart sample  Looks complicated, right? Wait until you see the code matching that diagram, that is   depicted in this next code snippet.  247   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class SeasonDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       Read a     int a = Integer.parseInt args[0] ;      if a == 12   a>=1 && a<= 2   {         System.out.println "Winter" ;     } else {         if  a>2 && a <= 5   {         System.out.println "Spring" ;         } else {         if  a>5 && a <= 8   {             System.out.println "Summer" ;         } else {             if  a>8 && a <= 11   {             System.out.println "Autumn" ;             } else {             System.out.println "Error" ;             }         }         }     }     } }  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class SeasonDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       Read a     int a = Integer.parseInt args0 ;  248  Looks ugly, right? But, fortunately, Java provides a way to simplify it, especially   because it makes no sense having so many else blocks that only contain another if  statement. The simplified code connects the else statements with the contained if s   statements. And the code ends up looking like the following code snippet.   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      if  a == 12   a >= 1 && a <= 2   {         System.out.println "Winter" ;     } else if  a > 2 && a <= 5  {         System.out.println "Spring" ;     } else if  a > 5 && a <= 8  {         System.out.println "Summer" ;     } else if  a > 8 && a <= 11  {         System.out.println "Autumn" ;     } else {         System.out.println "Error" ;     }     } }  Any argument given by the user that is not in the [1,12] causes the program to print   Error. You can test it for yourself if you want by modifying your IntelliJ IDEA launcher.  The elements to focus on are underlined in Figure 7-5.  Figure 7-5.  IntelliJ IDEA launcher and parameters  249   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW   switch Statement When a value requires different actions for a fixed set of values, the if might get more  complex, the more the set of values increases. In this case the more suitable statement  is the switch statement. Let’s look at the code first, and then check what more can be  improved.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class SeasonSwitchDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       Read a     int a = Integer.parseInt args[0] ;      var season = "";     switch  a  {         case 1:         season = "Winter";         break;         case 2:         season = "Winter";         break;         case 3:         season = "Spring";         break;         case 4:         season = "Spring";         break;         case 5:         season = "Spring";         break;         case 6:         season = "Summer";         break;         case 7:         season = "Summer";         break;  250   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW          case 8:         season = "Summer";         break;         case 9:         season = "Autumn";         break;         case 10:         season = "Autumn";         break;         case 11:         season = "Autumn";         break;         case 12:         season = "winter";         break;         default:         System.out.println "Error" ;     }     System.out.println season ;     } }  switch  [onvar]  {     case [option]:     [statement;]     break;     ...     default:     [statement;] }  Hm... that does not look very practical, at least not for this scenario. Before showing  how the switch statement can be written differently, let’s explain the structure and logic  of it first. The general template of a switch statement is  251   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  The terms in square brackets are detailed in the following list.              [onvar] is the variable that is tested against the case statements  to select a statement. It can be of any primitive type, enumerations  and starting with Java 7, String. Clearly the switch statement is not  limited by conditions evaluated to boolean results, which allows for a  lot of flexibility.  case [option] is a value the variable is matched upon to make a  decision regarding the statement to execute. A case as the keyword  states.  [statement] is a statement or a groups of statements to execute  when [onvar] == [option]. Considering that there is no  else branch, we have to make sure that only the statement s   corresponding to the first match is executed, which is where the  break; statement comes in. The break statement stops the current  execution path and moves the execution point to the next statement  outside the statement that contains it. I’ll cover it later in the chapter.  Without it, after the first match, all subsequent cases are traversed,  and statements corresponding to them are executed.  So, if we execute the preceding program and we provide number  7 as an argument, the text Summer is printed. But if the break  statements for case 7 and 8 are commented, the output changes to  Autumn.      default [statement;] is a statement that is executed when no  match on a case has been found, the default case does not need  a break statement. If the previous program is run with any number  outside the [1-12] interval, Error is printed because the default  statement is executed.  Now that you understand how switch works, let’s look at how we can reduce the   previous statement. The month example is suitable here, because it can further be  modified to show how the switch statement can be simplified, when a single statement  should be executed for multiple cases. In our code, writing each assignment statement  three times is a little redundant. switch can be written in a different way to avoid that by  grouping the cases. The code is depicted next.  252   package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class SeasonSwitchDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       Read a     int a = Integer.parseInt args0 ;      var season = "";     switch  a  {         case 1:         case 2:         case 12:         season = "winter";              break;          case 3:          case 4:          case 5:          season = "Spring";          break;          case 6:          case 7:          case 8:          season = "Summer";             break;          case 9:          case 10:          case 11:          season = "Autumn";          break;          default:          System.out.println "Error" ;     }     System.out.println season ;     } }  ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  253   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  The grouping in this case represents the alignment of the cases that require the same   statement to be executed, and writing it only once in the last one. This still looks a little  weird, but this is the only way to reduce the statement repetition. The behavior in the  previous case is possible because each case without a break statement is followed by the  next case statement.  In Java 7, the switch statement started supporting String values. The main  problems with switch supporting String values is that there is always a risk of  NullPointerExceptions being thrown, because the equals method is used to test  matching of the items, and the variable used in the switch statement can be null. Also,  because equals is used, the comparison is case sensitive. If we modify the previous  example and ask the user for a text representing the month, and use switch to decide the  season to print, unless we use the exact text in case options that the user will use when  writing the argument, we won’t get the expected result.  The code changes to  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class StringSwitchSeasonDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         Read a       String a = args0;        var season = "";       switch  a  {         case "january":         case "february":         case "december":         season = "winter";         break;         case "march":         case "april":         case "may":         season = "Spring";         break;  254   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW          case "june":         case "july":         case "august":         season = "Summer";         break;         case "september":         case "october":         case "november":         season = "Autumn";         break;         default:         System.out.println "Error" ;       }       System.out.println season ;     } }  If we run the previous program with the "january" argument, the text "winter"   is printed in the console. If we run it with argument "january", the text "Error" is  printed in the console. And if we run it with null, a NullPointerException is thrown  in the line where the switch statement begins.  And this is all that can be said about the switch statement. In practice, depending on   the solution you are trying to develop, you might decide to use a combination of if and  switch statements.  Unfortunately because of its peculiar logic and its flexible number of options, it is   difficult to draw a flowchart for the switch statement, but nevertheless I’ve tried and it’s  depicted in Figure 7-6.  255   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  Figure 7-6.  The switch statement flowchart   Looping Statements Sometimes in programming, we need repetitive steps that involve the same variables.   To write the same statement over and over again to get the job done would be ridiculous.  Let’s take the example of sorting an array of integer values. The most known algorithm  to do this and the one that is taught first in programming courses because it is simple  is called bubble sort. The algorithm compares the elements of an array, two by two and  if they are not in the correct order it swaps them. It goes over the array again and again  until no more swaps are needed. The effects of the algorithm are depicted in Figure 7-7.  256   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  Figure 7-7.  Bubble sort phases and effect  This algorithm performs two types of loops; one iterates each element of the array  using indexes. And this traversal is repeated until no swaps are necessary. In Java this  algorithm can be written in more than one way using different looping statements. But  we’ll get there, let’s take it slow.  There are three types of looping statements in Java.              for statement  while statement  do-while statement  The for looping statement is the most used, but while and do-while have their uses   as well.   for Statements For is recommended for iterating on objects like arrays and lists that can be counted. For  example, traversing an array and printing each one of its values is as simple as depicted  in the following code sample.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};  257   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW        for  int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i  {         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;       }     } }  Based on the previous example, a flowchart for the for statement can be drawn and   it is depicted in Figure 7-8. The following code snippet depicts the for loop template.  for  [int_expr]; [condition];[step] {         [code_block] }  Figure 7-8.  The for statement flowchart  Each of the terms between square brackets have a specific purpose that is explained   next.      258  [init_expr] is an initialization expression that sets the initial value  of the counter used by this loop. It ends with ; and is not mandatory,  as the initialization can be done outside the statement, especially if  we are interested in using the counter variable later in the code and  outside the statement. The preceding code can be written like this:   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {        int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};     int i = 0;     for  ; i < arr.length; ++i  {         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;     }     System.out.println "Loop exited with index: " + i ;     } }      [condition] is the termination condition of the loop, as long as this  condition is evaluated to true, the loop will continue executing.  The condition ends with ; and funny enough, it is not mandatory  either, as the termination condition can be placed inside the code to  be executed repeatedly by the loop. So, the preceding code can be  modified further and written like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {        int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};     int i = 0;     for  ; ; ++i  {         if  i >= arr.length  {         break;         }         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;     }     System.out.println "Loop exited with index: " + i ;     } }  259   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      [step] is the step expression or increment that increases the counter  on every step of the loop. It should end in ;, but it is often dropped,  and as you probably already expected, it is not mandatory either, as  nothing stops the developer from manipulating the counter inside  the code block. So, the preceding code can also be written like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {     int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};     int i = 0;     for  ; ;  {         if  i >= arr.length  {         break;         }         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;         ++i;     }     System.out.println "Loop exited with index: " + i ;     } }  The modification of the counter does not have to be done inside  the code; it can be done in the termination condition, but the  initialization expression and the termination condition must be  modified accordingly to fit the purpose. The code depicted next  has the same effect as all the samples before it.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {     int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};     for  int i = -1; i++ < arr.length -1;  {            System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;     }  260   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      System.out.println "Loop exited with index: " + i ;     }  }  The step expression does not have to be an incrementation. It  can be any expression that modifies the value of the counter.  Instead of ++i or i++, you can use i= i+1, or i=i+3, or even  decrementation if the array of list is traversed starting with a  bigger index. Any mathematical operations that keep the counter  in the boundaries of the type it was declared and within the  indexes range can be used safely.      [code_block] is a block of code executed repeatedly, in every step  of the loop. If there is no exit condition within this code, this block  of code is executed by as many times as the counter passes the  termination condition.  This is the basic form of the for looping statement, but in Java there are other ways to   iterate a group of values. Let’s say that instead of an array, we have to iterate over a list.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.util.List;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       List  list = List.of 5, 1, 4, 2, 3 ;       for  int j = 0; j < list.size  ; ++j  {         System.out.println "list[" + j + "] = " + list.get j  ;       }     } }  The code seems somehow impractical and that is why List  instances can be   traversed with a different type of for statement that was known as forEach until Java 8.  You will see immediately why, but first let’s look at forEach.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.util.List;  261   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       List  list = List.of 5, 1, 4, 2, 3 ;       for  Integer item : list  {         System.out.println item ;       }     } }  This type of for statement is also called as having enhanced syntax and basically   executes the code block for each item in the collection used in its expression. This means  it works on any implementation of Collection interface and it works on arrays too. So,  the example code is written like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};       for  int item : arr  {         System.out.println item ;      }     } }  Clearly the best part in this case is that we no longer need a termination condition,  or counter at all. Starting with Java 8, the name forEach is no longer needed for the for  statement with enhanced syntax, because the forEach default method was added to all  Collection extensions. Combine that with lambda expressions and the code to print the  elements of a list becomes  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.util.List;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {       List  list = List.of 5, 1, 4, 2, 3 ;       list.forEach item -> System.out.println item  ;         or  262   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW        list.forEach System.out::println ;     } }  Pretty neat, ha? But wait, there’s more, it works on arrays too, but a small conversion  to suitable implementation BaseStream is necessary first. But it is provided by the Arrays  utility class that was enriched in Java 8 with methods to support lambda expressions. So  yeah, the code with the arr array can be written  starting in Java  8 like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ForLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {     int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};        Arrays.stream arr .forEach System.out::println ;     } }  In Java 11, all the preceding examples compile and execute just fine, so use whatever   syntax you prefer most when writing your solutions.   while Statement The while statement is different from the for statement in that there is not a fixed  number of steps that have to be executed, so a counter is not always needed. The  number of repetitions of a while statement executes depends only on how many times  the continuation condition that controls this number is evaluated to true. So, the generic  template for this statement is depicted in the following listing:  while  [eval condition ] == true  {  [code_block] }  A while statement does not really require an initialization statement either, as it can   be inside the code block, or outside the statement. The while statement can replace  the for statement, but the advantage of the for statement is that it encapsulates the  initialization, the termination condition and the modification of the counter in a single  block, so it’s more concise. The array traversal code sample can be rewritten using the  while statement; the code is listed next.  263   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class WhileLoopDemo {     public static void main String... args  {     int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};     int  i=0;     while i < arr.length {         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;         ++i;     }     } }  As you can see, the declaration and initialization of the counter variable, int i=0;   is done outside the statement and the incrementation of the counter is done inside  the code block to be repeated. Basically at this point, if we design the flowchart for this  scenario, it will look the same as the for statement depicted in Figure 7-9.  And as incredible as it sounds, the [condition] is not mandatory either, as it can be   replaced directly with true. But in this case, you have to make sure that there is an exit  condition inside the block of code that executes at some point; otherwise, the execution  will most likely end with an error. And this condition must be placed at the beginning  of the block of code to prevent the execution of the useful logic in a situation where it  shouldn’t be. For our simple example, we do not want to call System.out.println for an  element with an index outside the array range.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class WhileLoopDemo { public static void main String... args  {    int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};     int  i=0;     while true {         if  i >= arr.length  {         break;         }  264   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW          System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;         ++i;     }     } }  The while statement is best used when we are working with a resource that is not  always online. Let’s say we are using a remote database for our application that is in a  network that is unstable. Instead of giving up trying to save our data after the first timeout,  we could try until we succeed, right? This is done by using a while statement that tries to  initialize a connection object in its code block. And the code looks roughly like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.sql.*;  public class ConnectionTester {     public static void main String... args  throws Exception {      Connection con = null;     while  con == null  {         try {         Class.forName "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" ;         con = DriverManager.getConnection              "jdbc:mysql:  localhost:3306 sample", "root", "pass" ;         } catch  Exception e  {         System.out.println "Connection refused. Retrying in 5 seconds ..." ;         Thread.sleep 5000 ;         }     }        con != null, do something     Statement stmt = con.createStatement  ;     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery "select * from test" ;     while  rs.next    {         System.out.println rs.getInt 1  + "  " + rs.getString 2  ;     }     con.close  ;     } }  265   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  The problem with this code is that it runs forever; if we want to give up trying after a  certain time, we must introduce a variable that counts the number of tries and then exits  the loop using a break statement.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.sql.*;  public class ConnectionTester {     public static final int MAX_TRIES = 10;      public static void main String... args  throws Exception {      int cntTries = 0;     Connection con = null;     while  con == null && cntTries < MAX_TRIES  {         try {         Class.forName "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" ;         con = DriverManager.getConnection              "jdbc:mysql:  localhost:3306 sample", "root", "pass" ;         } catch  Exception e  {         ++cntTries;         System.out.println "Connection refused. Retrying in 5 seconds ..." ;         Thread.sleep 5000 ;         }     }     if  con != null  {            con != null, do something         Statement stmt = con.createStatement  ;         ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery "select * from test" ;         while  rs.next    {         System.out.println rs.getInt 1  + "  " + rs.getString 2  ;         }         con.close  ;     } else {         System.out.println "Could not connect!" ;     }     } }  266   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  So, as a rule of thumb, always make sure there is an exit condition when using   looping statements.  And since we’ve covered all the statements needed to implement the bubble sort   algorithm depicted in Figure 7-9, let’s see what the code looks like. Be aware that,  this algorithm can be written in many ways, but the following code best matches the  explanation provided earlier. So, while there are elements in the array that are not in the  proper order, the array is traversed again and again and adjacent elements are swapped  to fit the desired order  ascending, in this case .  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.util.Arrays;  public class BubbleSortDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {     boolean swapped = true;     while  swapped  {         swapped = false;         for  int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i  {         if  arr[i] > arr[i + 1]  {             int temp = arr[i];             arr[i] = arr[i + 1];             arr[i + 1] = temp;             swapped = true;         }         }     }     Arrays.stream arr .forEach System.out::println ;     } }  267   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  When run, the code swaps elements of the arr array until they are all in ascending   order, so the last line in the code prints the modified arr:   do-while Statement The do-while statement is similar to the while, with one difference, the continuation  condition is evaluated after executing the code block. This causes for the code block to  be executed at least once, unless there is a an exit condition embedded in it. The generic  template for this statement is depicted in the following listing:  do {  [code_block] } while  [eval condition ] == true   Most times statements while and do-while can be easily interchanged, and   sometimes a minimum change of the logic of the code block is needed. For example,  traversing an array and printing the values of its elements can be written using do-while  as well, without changing the code block. Figure 7-9 shows the two implementations side  by side: the while on the left and do-while on the right.  Figure 7-9.  while and do-while implementation for printing elements of an array  1 2 3 4 5  268   The flowchart for these two examples  see Figure 7-10  reveals the different logic   between the two statements.  ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  Figure 7-10.  Comparison between while and do-while statements flowcharts  The do-while statement works best when the code block must be executed at least   once; otherwise, we evaluate the condition once unnecessarily. Remember the code  sample that was trying to connect to a database that was in an unstable network? Well,  when while was used, the execution started by testing if the connection is not null, but  the connection was not even initialized yet.  Connection con = null; while  con == null  {      Class.forName "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" ;      con = DriverManager.getConnection      "jdbc:mysql:  localhost:3306 sample", "root", "pass" ;      ... }  269   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  This implementation, although functional, is a little redundant and the logic  is not following programming best practices. More suitable would be a do-while  implementation, one that avoids testing if the con instance is null, considering that it  clearly is, as in the following.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  import java.sql.*;  public class DoConnectionTester {     public static final int MAX_TRIES = 10;      public static void main String... args  throws Exception {      int cntTries = 0;     Connection con = null;     do {         try {         Class.forName "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" ;         con = DriverManager.getConnection              "jdbc:mysql:  localhost:3306 sample", "root", "pass" ;         } catch  Exception e  {         ++cntTries;         System.out.println "Connection refused. Retrying in 5 seconds ..." ;         Thread.sleep 5000 ;         }     } while   con == null && cntTries < MAX_TRIES ;     if  con != null  {            con != null, do something         Statement stmt = con.createStatement  ;         ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery "select * from test" ;         while  rs.next    {         System.out.println rs.getInt 1  + "  " + rs.getString 2  ;         }         con.close  ;  270   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      } else {         System.out.println "Could not connect!" ;     }     } }  Sure, skipping the evaluation of the condition is not a big optimization, but in a big   application, every little optimization counts.   Breaking Loops and Skipping Steps In the previous examples, I mentioned that exiting a loop using the break statement.  There are three ways to manipulate the behavior of a loop:     The break statement exits the loop, and if accompanied by a label,  it breaks the loop that is labeled with it; this is useful when we have  more nested loops, because we can break form any of the nested  loops, not just the one containing the statement.     The continue statement skips the execution of any code after it and   continues with the next step.     The return statement is used to exit a method, so if the loop, or if or  switch statement is within the body of a method, it is used to exit the  loop as well. In regards to best practices, usage of return statements  to exit a method should not be abused as they might make the  execution flow difficult to follow.   break Statement The break statement can only be used within switch, for, while, and do-while  statements. You have already seen how it can be used within the switch statement; let’s  look at how to use it in all the others.  Breaking out of a for, while or do-while loop can be done using the break   statement, but it must be controlled by an exit condition; otherwise, no step is executed.  In the following code sample, we print only the first three elements, even if the for loop  should traverse all of them. If we get to the index equal to 3, we exit the loop.  271   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ManipulationDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {      for  int i = 0; i < arr.length ; ++i  {         if   i == 3  {         System.out.println "Bye bye!" ;         break;         }         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;     }     } }  If we have a case of nested loops, a label can be used to decide the looping statement  to break out of. As an example, in the following code we have three nested for loops, and  we exit the middle loop when all indexes are equal.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ManipulationDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {        for  int i = 0; i < 2; ++i  {         HERE: for  int j = 0; j < 2; ++j  {         for  int k = 0; k < 2; ++k  {             System.out.println " i, j, k  =  " + i + "," + j + "," + k + " " ;              if  i == j && j == k  {             break HERE;             }         }         }     }     } }  272   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  The label used in the code sample is named HERE, and it precedes the for statement   that is exited when the condition is fulfilled and follows the break statement. Writing  label names in all all-caps letters is considered a best practice in development as it  avoids confusing labels with variables or class named when reading the code. To make sure this works, you can take a look in the console to see that all   combinations of  i,j,k , including the ones with i = j = k and all after it, are no  longer printed. In this case, all sets beginning with 0 are skipped, which is what is in the  console.   i, j, k  =  1,0,0   i, j, k  =  1,0,1   i, j, k  =  1,1,0    continue Statement The continue statement does not break a loop, but can be used to skip certain steps  based on a condition. So it basically, stops the current step of the loop and moves to  the next one, so you could say that this statement continues the loop. Let’s continue  experimenting with the array traversal example, and this time, let’s skip from printing the  elements with odd indexes by using the continue statement.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ManipulationDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {        for  int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i  {         if  i % 2  != 0  {         continue;         }         System.out.println "arr[" + i + "] = " + arr[i] ;     }     } }  273   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  This statement must be conditioned; otherwise, the loop will iterate uselessly. The   continue statement can be used with labels too. Let’s take a similar example to the three  nested for loops used earlier, but this time, when the k index is equal to 1, nothing is  printed and we skip to the next step of the loop enclosing the k loop.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ManipulationDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {        for  int i = 0; i < 3; ++i  {         HERE:         for  int j = 0; j < 3; ++j  {         for  int k = 0; k < 3; ++k  {             if  k == 1  {             continue HERE;             }             System.out.println " i, j, k  =  " + i + "," + j + "," + k + " " ;         }         }     }     } }  To make sure this works, you can take a look in the console to see that what combinations   are printed. We clearly notice that no combination with k=1 or k=2 has printed.   i, j, k  =  0,0,0   i, j, k  =  0,1,0   i, j, k  =  0,2,0   i, j, k  =  1,0,0   i, j, k  =  1,1,0   i, j, k  =  1,2,0   i, j, k  =  2,0,0   i, j, k  =  2,1,0   i, j, k  =  2,2,0   274   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  !  The usage of labels to break out of loops is frowned upon in the Java  community, because jumping to a label resembles the goto statement that  still can be found in certain old school programming languages. goto is a Java  reserved keyword, because this statement used to exist in the first version of  the JVM, but it was later removed. Using jumping makes code less readable,  less testable and promotes bad design. That is why goto was removed in  later versions, but any need of such operation can be implemented break and  continue statements.   return Statement The return statement is an easy one. It can be used to exit the execution of a method  body. If the method returns a value, the return statement is accompanied by the value  returned. The return statement can be used to exit any of the statements mentioned in  this section. It can represent a smart way to shortcut the execution of a method, as the  execution of the current method stops and processing continues from the point in the  code that called the method.  Let’s look at a few examples. First let’s write a method that finds the first even  element in an array; if found, the method returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ReturnDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {     int foundIdx = findEven arr ;     if  foundIdx != -1  {         System.out.println "First even is at: " + foundIdx ;     }     }  275   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW      public static int findEven int ... arr  {     for  int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i  {         if  arr[i] %2 == 0  {          return i;         }     }     return -1;     } }  Let’s write the same method but using a while statement.  package com.apress.bgn.ch7;  public class ReturnDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {     int foundIdx = findEven arr ;     if  foundIdx != -1  {         System.out.println "First even is at: " + foundIdx ;     }     }      public static int findEven int ... arr  {     int i = 0;     while  i < arr.length  {         if  arr[i] % 2 == 0  {          return i;         }         ++i;     }     return -1;     } }  The return statement can be used in any situation where we want to terminate the   execution of a method if a condition is met.  276   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW   Controlling the Flow Using try-catch Constructions Exceptions and try-catch statements were already mentioned in this book, but not as  tools to control flow execution. Before we skip to explanations and examples, let’s first  discuss the general template of a try-catch-finally statement.  try {  [code_block] } catch  [exception_block]} {  [handling_code_block] } finally {  [cleanup_code_block] }  I’ll explain each of these components.  [code_block] is the code block to execute.              [exception_block] is a declaration or more of an exception type that  can be thrown by the [code_block].  [handling_code_block] - an exception being thrown marks an  unexpected situation, which must be handled, once the exception  is being caught, this piece of code is executed to treat it, whether by  trying to return the system to a normal state or by logging details  about the cause of the exception.      [clean_up_code] is a block of code releases resources or sets objects  to null so that they are eligible for collection.  Now that you know how a try-catch-finally works, you can probably imagine   how to use it to control the execution flow. Basically, within the [code_block], you can  explicitly throw exceptions and decide how they are treated.  Considering the array that we have been using until now, we’ll design our piece of   code based on it again. First, let’s write a piece of code that throws an exception when an  even value is found.  277   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  package com.apress.bgn.ch7.ex;  public class ExceptionFlowDemo {     public static final int arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 3};      public static void main String... args  {      try {         checkNotEven arr ;         System.out.println "Not found, all good!" ;     } catch  EvenException e  {         System.out.println e.getMessage   ;     } finally {         System.out.println "Cleaning up arr" ;         for  int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i  {         arr[i] = 0;         }     }     }      public static int checkNotEven int... arr  throws EvenException {     for  int i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i  {         if  arr[i] % 2 == 0  {         throw new EvenException "Did not expect an even number at " + i ;         }     }     return -1;     } }  The EvenException type is a custom exception type written for this specific example  and its implementation is not relevant here. If we execute this piece of code the following  is printed.  Did not expect an even number at 2 Cleaning up arr  By throwing an exception, we’ve directed the execution to the handling code,    so Not found, all good! was not printed, and because we have a finally block that was  executed as well.  278   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW  So, yeah, you can mix-and-match: use different types of exceptions, have multiple  catch blocks—whatever you need to solve your problem. At a previous company that  I worked for, I stumbled upon a piece of code that was validating a document and  throwing different types of exceptions depending on the validation check that was not  passed and in the finally block we had a code that was converting the error object to  PDF. The code looks similar to this:  ... ErrorContainter errorContainer = new ErrorContainter  ; try {         validate report ; } catch  FileNotFoundException  NotParsable e  {         errorContainer.addBadFileError e ; } catch  InvestmentMaxException e  {         errorContainer.addInvestmentError e ; } catch  CreditIncompatibilityException e  {         errorContainer.addIncompatibilityError e ; } finally {         if  errorContainer.isEmpty    {             printValidationPassedDocument  ;         } else {             printValidationFailedDocument errorContainer ;         } } ...  The code in the finally code block was complex and totally not recommended  to be in there. But sometimes in the real world, the solutions do not always respect  best practices, or even common sense practices. And when dealing with legacy code,  you might find yourself in the position to write crappy but functional code that must  be delivered fast. Because, sure programming is awesome, but in the eyes of some  managers, results are more important. If you are lucky enough to get a job at a company  that is looking to build on the code in the future or hand it to other team members, you  might actually end up with a manager that favors best practices. Just remember to do  your best, and document everything properly and you’ll be fine.   279   ChaPTer 7    COnTrOllIng The FlOW   Summary This chapter covered one of the most important things in development: how to design  your solutions, the logic of it. You’ve also been introduced to what flowcharts are and  their components, as tools for deciding how to write your code and how to control  execution paths. And finally, you’ve learned which statements to use and when. A few  Java best practices were discussed, so that you are able to design the most suitable  solutions to your problems.

In the software development context the definitions that are closest to a stream are  the fifth and part of the seventh  highlighted in bold . I software development a stream  is a sequence of objects from a source that supports aggregate operations. In your mind,  you would be saying right now: so, is it similar to a collection? Well... not quite.   Introduction to Streams Consider a really big collection of songs that we want to analyze. We want to find all  songs with duration of at least 300 seconds. We want to save the names of these songs in  a list and sort them by decreasing order of their duration. Assuming we already have the  songs in a list, the code looks like this:  List  songList = ... List  resultedSongs = new ArrayList   ;    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_8  281   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  for  Song song: songList  {       if  song.getDuration   >= 300  {            resultedSongs.add song ;       } } Collections.sort resultedSongs, new Comparator   {     public int compare Song s1, Song s2 {          return s2.getDuration  .compareTo s1.getDuration   ;     } } ; System.out.println resultedSongs ; List  finalList = new ArrayList   ; for  Song song: resultedSongs  {     finalList.add song.getTitle   ; } System.out.println finalList ;   One of the problems with this code is that processing large collections is not really   efficient. Also, we are traversing lists over and over again and performing checks to get to  a final result. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just link all of those operations together and  execute them on the initial list?  Enter Java 8 and the new Stream abstraction that represents a sequence of elements   that can be processed sequentially or in parallel and supports aggregate operations.  Because of the latest evolutions in hardware development, CPUs have become more  powerful and more complex, containing multiple cores that can process information  in parallel. To make use of these hardware capabilities in Java the Fork Join Framework  was introduced. And in Java 8, the Stream API was introduced to support parallel data  processing, without the boiler-code of defining and synchronizing threads. The central  interface of the Stream API is the java.util.stream.BaseStream. Any object with  stream capabilities is of a type that extends it. A stream does not store elements itself,  it is not a data structure, it is used to compute elements and serve them on-demand to  a function or a set of aggregate functions. Serving the elements in a sequence involves  an internal automatic iteration. Functions that return a stream can be chained in a  pipeline, and are called intermediate operations. They are used to process elements of a  stream and return the result as a stream to the next function in the pipeline. Functions   282   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  that return a result that is not a stream are called terminal operations and are obviously  present at the end of a pipeline. As a quick example before getting deeper, the previous  code can be written like this using streams:  List  finalList = songList.stream  .filter s -> s.getDuration  >= 300       .sorted Comparator.comparing Song::getDuration .reversed         .map Song::getTitle       .collect Collectors.toList   ; System.out.println finalList ;  Yup, programming with streams is awesome. The Stream API concept allows   developers to transform collections into streams, and write code to process the data in  parallel and then getting the results into a collection.  Because working with streams is a sensitive way of programming; I recommend   designing the code by taking every possibility in mind. NullPointerException is one  of the most common exceptions to be thrown in Java. In Java 8, the class Optional   was introduced to avoid this type of exceptions. Stream  instances are used to store  an infinite instances of type T, while Optional  is an instance that might or might  not contain an instance of type T. Because both of these implementations are basically  wrappers for other types, they are covered together.  !  For practical reasons, Stream instances are referred in this chapter as streams,  in a similar manner as List instances are referred as lists and collection  instances as collections, and many more. !  You might notice that the term function was introduced and refers to the  methods called on streams or their arguments. this is because working with  streams allows for Java code to be written in functional programming style.  Java is an object-oriented programming language, and the object is its core  term. In functional programming, the core term is pure function. Code is written  by composing pure functions, which avoids shared states, takes advantage of  immutable data, and avoids the side effects of processing contamination.1  1 The following is a very good article about the functional programming paradigm  and I gladly recommend you to read it: https:  medium.com  javascript-scene  master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0  283   Chapter 8    the Stream apI   Creating Streams Before having fun and optimizing our code using streams let’s see how we can create  them. To create a stream, we need a source. That source can be anything: a collection   list, set or map , an array, I O resources used as input  such as files, databases, or  anything that can be transformed into a sequence of instances .  A stream does not modify its source, so multiple stream instances can be created   from the same source and used for different operations.   Creating Streams from Collections In the introduction of the chapter, in the last snippet of code we were introduced to one  method of creating a stream from a list. Starting with Java 8, all collection interfaces and  classes were enriched with default methods that return streams. In the following code  sample, we take a list of integers and transform it into a stream by calling its stream    method. After having a stream, we traverse it using the forEach method to print the  values in the stream and the name of the execution thread this code is executed on. Why,  the thread name you ask? You see shortly.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8;  import java.util.List;  public class StreamsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         List  bigList = List.of  50, 10, 250, 100 ... ;          bigList.stream              .forEach i ->               System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i              ;        } }  284   The previous code creates a stream of integer elements. The Stream interface exposes   a set of methods that each Stream implementation provides a concrete implementation  for. The most used is the forEach method that iterates over the elements in the stream.  The forEach method requires a parameter of type java.util.function.Consumer .  Chapter 8    the Stream apI  !  a consumer is what we call in this book an inline implementation of the java. util.function.Consumer  functional interface. this means it has only has  one method that a class implementing it has to provide a concrete implementation  for. the method named accept T t , takes a stream element of type T as  argument, processes it and returns nothing.  This method is called for each element in the stream, and the T is the type of the  elements in the stream. The implementing class is basically declared inline by only  mentioning the body of the method. The JVM does the rest, because of the magic of  lambda expressions. Without them, you would have to write something like this:  import java.util.function.Consumer; ... bigList.stream         .forEach new Consumer    {             @Override              public void accept Integer i  {                System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i ;              } } ;  Actually, this was the way you would write code before lambda expressions were   introduced in Java 8. If you needed to create a single object of a class type implementing  a specific interface, in a singular place in the application, you could choose to write a  contraption like that, which looks like you are instantiating the interface; the result of that  code is called an anonymous class. Lambda expressions simplified this process a lot, but  only for a category of interfaces named functional interfaces, which define a single method  and are annotated with the @FunctionalInterface annotation  starting in Java 8 .  285   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  In the previous example, the implementation prints the thread name and the value   of the element. The following is the result is of running that code.  main: 50 main: 10 main: 250 main: 100 ...  The fact that each number is prefixed with main means that all integers in the stream  are processed sequentially by the same thread, and is the main thread of the application.  !  For practical reasons, there is no need to call stream  for collections when  a sequential stream is needed only for traversal, because the forEach method  defined for them does the job well. So the preceding code can be reduced to  bigList.forEach i ->           System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i   ;  The name of the thread was printed because there is another way to create a stream   by calling the parallelStream   method. The only difference is that the returned  stream is a parallel stream. This means that each element of the stream is processed on  a different thread. Of course, this means the implementation of the Consumer must be  thread-safe and not contain code that involves instances that are not meant to be shared  amongst threads. The code to print the value of a stream element, does not affect the  value of the element returned by the stream, not other external object, so it is safe to  parallelize. So let’s use parallelStream   instead of stream to create a stream and print  the elements of the stream using the same Consumer implementation.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8;  import java.util.List; import java.util.function.Consumer;  public class StreamsDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         List  bigList = List.of  50, 10, 250, 100 ... ;  286   Chapter 8    the Stream apI          bigList.parallelStream                .forEach i ->                  System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i           ;        } }  If we execute the code in the console, we see something similar to the output, but   slightly different.  ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-9: 94 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7: 10 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5: 40052 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3: 50 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-13: 74 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-9: 200 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-11: 250 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7: 83 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3: 23 ...  The first thing you notice is the thread name, we no longer have one, but a lot of  them all named ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-**. This tells us that all stream  elements are processed on different threads, but all of them are part of the same pool.  A thread pool is created by the JVM in this case to contain a few thread instances, used  to process all elements in the stream in parallel. The advantage of using a thread pool is  that the threads can be reused, so no new thread instances need to be created and this  optimizes the execution time a little, but it is visible only in more complex solutions.  If you look at the number associated to each thread, the number at the end of the   thread name, you can see that the numbers sometimes repeat. This basically means the  same thread was reused to process another stream element.   Creating Streams from Arrays The streams we have used so far, were created from a List instance. The same syntax can  be used for Set instances as well.  287   But streams can be created from arrays as well. Look at the following piece of code.  Chapter 8    the Stream apI  package com.apress.bgn.ch8;  import java.util.Arrays; public class ArrayStreamDemo {      public static void main String... args  {        int[] arr = { 50, 10, 250, 100 ...};          Arrays.stream arr .forEach             i -> System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i           ;     } }  The static method stream int[] array  from the utility class Arrays creates a   stream of primitives. For arrays that contain objects, the method called is stream T[]  array   where T is a generic type  that is replaced with the type of the elements in  the array. Streams generated from arrays can be parallelized by calling the parallel  methods, which exist for parallel streams as well. So, the following code can be  parallelized, as shown.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8;  import java.util.Arrays; public class ArrayStreamDemo {      public static void main String... args  {        int[] arr = { 50, 10, 250, 100 ...};          Arrays.stream arr .parallel  .forEach              i -> System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i           ;     } }  For both cases, the output is the same as in the previous examples, so there is no   need to depict it again.  288   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  The novelty with arrays is that a stream can be created form a part of the array by   specifying the start and the end indexes for the array chunk.  Arrays.stream arr, 3,6 .forEach     i -> System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + ": " + i   ;   Creating Empty Streams When writing Java code, a good practice is to write methods that return objects by  avoiding returning null to reduce the possibility of NullPointerExceptions being  thrown. When methods return streams, the preferred way is to return an empty stream.  This can be done by calling the static Stream.empty   method of the Stream interface.  The following method, receives a list of Song instances as a parameter and returns a  stream using it as a source. If the list is null or empty, an empty stream is returned.  public static Stream  asStream List  inputList  {         if  inputList == null  inputList.isEmpty    {             return Stream.empty  ;         } else {             return inputList.stream  ;         } }   Creating Finite Streams Aside from creating streams from actual sources, streams can be created on the spot by  calling stream utility methods like Stream.generate   or Stream.builder  .  The builder   method should be used when we want to build a limited stream with   a fixed sets of known values. This method returns an instance of java.util.stream. Stream.Builder , an internal interface that declare a default method named add ..   that needs to be called to add the elements of the stream. To create the Stream instance,  its build method must be finally called. The add ..  method returns a reference to the  Builder instance so it can be chained with any other methods of this class. The following  code is a sample of how the builder   method can be used to create a finite stream of  Integer values.  289   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Stream  built = Stream. builder        .add 50 .add 10 .add 250 .build  ;  As the Builder interface is a generic one, it is mandatory to specify a type argument,   as the type of the elements in the stream. Also, the builder   method is generic and  requires the type to be provided as a parameter in front of it, right before being called. If  no type is specified the default Object is used.  To create a stream, the generate ..  method can also be used. This method receives   as a parameter an instance of type java.util.function.Supplier  instance.  !  a supplier is what we call in this book an inline implementation of the java. util.function.Supplier  functional interface. this interface requires a  concrete implementation to be provided for its single method named get  . this  method should return the element to be added to the stream.  So, if we want to generate a stream of integers, a proper implementation for get     should return a random integer. The expanded code is depicted next; no lambda  expressions are used to make it clear that the get ..  receives as a parameter a  Supplier  instance created on the spot.  Stream  generated = Stream.generate          new Supplier    {               @Override                public Integer get   {                      Random rand = new Random  ;                      return rand.nextInt 300  + 1;                 }           }      .limit 15 ;  The limit method limits the number of elements generated by the supplier to 15;  otherwise, the generated stream is infinite. If we make use of lambda expressions, the  previous code reduces to  Stream  generated = Stream.generate          -> new Random  .nextInt 300  + 1  .limit 15 ;  290   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  But this is not all; if Supplier .get   always returns the same number, no   matter how useless it is, it can be done and the previous code becomes  Stream  generated = Stream.generate     -> 5 .limit 15 ;  If more control is needed over the elements in the stream, the iterate ..  method   can be used. It was introduced in Java 9 and using this method is like having a for  statement generate the entries for the stream. The method receives as arguments an  initial value called a seed, a predicate that determines when the iteration should stop,  and an iteration step.  !  a predicate is an inline implementation of the functional interface java.util. function.Predicate  that declares a single method that returns a boolean  value. the implementation of this method should test its single argument of type T  against a condition and return true if the condition is fulfilled and false if not.  In the following example, stream elements are generated, starting from 0, using a   step of 5 and they are generated as long as the values are lesser than 50, as defined by the  predicate.  Stream  iterated = Stream.iterate 0, i -> i   i + 5 ;  As with the for statement, the termination condition is not mandatory and there is  an iterate ...  method version that does not require a predicate, but in this case the  limit ...  method must be used to make sure the stream is finite.  Stream  iterated = Stream.iterate 0,    i -> i + 5 .limit 15 ;  The first element of the stream is the seed value. In Java 9 aside from limit   there is another way to control the numbers of values in   a stream: the takeWhile ..  operation. This method takes the longest set of elements  from the original stream that matches the predicate received as argument, starting with  the first element. This works fine for ordered streams, but if the stream is unordered the  result is, any set of elements that match the predicate, including an empty one. Let’s  see it in action! The first code sample uses takeWhile ..  on a stream of integers and  returns a stream with elements that divide by 3.  291   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Stream  forTaking = Stream.of  3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 ; forTaking.takeWhile s -> s % 3 == 0     .forEach s -> System.out.print s + " "  ;  The code prints 3 6 9 because this is the first set of elements that match the   given predicate. If takeWhile ..  is called on an unordered stream, the result is  unpredictable. The result might be 3 6 9 or 12 36 18 42, as the result is a subset of any  elements matching the predicate. So the result of takeWhile ..  on an unordered  stream is non-deterministic.  Stream  forTaking = Stream.of  3, 6, 9, 2, 4, 8, 12, 36, 18, 42, 11, 13 ; forTaking.parallel  .takeWhile s -> s % 3 == 0     .forEach s -> System.out.print s + " "  ;  The takeWhile ..  operation is the "sister" of the dropWhile .. ; and does exactly   the reverse of what takeWhile ..  does: it returns, for an ordered stream, a stream  consisting elements after dropping the longest set of elements that match the predicate.  So in the following example, we expect the following elements to be printed in the  console: 11 12 13 15  Stream  forDropping = Stream.of  3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 ; forDropping.dropWhile s -> s % 3 == 0        .forEach s -> System.out.print s + " "  ;  The result of this operation for unordered streams is also non-deterministic, as the   operation can drop any set, including the empty one.  If these two operations are executed on parallel streams, the only thing that changes   is the order in which the elements are printed, but the result sets contain the same  elements.   Streams of Primitives and Streams of Strings When we first created a stream of primitives, we used an int[] array as a source. But  streams of primitives can be created in a different way, because the Stream API contains  more interfaces with default methods to make programming with streams practical.  Figure 8-1 shows the Stream hierarchy. The IntStream interface can be used to create  primitive streams of integers. This interface exposes many methods to do so, some of  them inherited from BaseStream. An IntStream instance can be created from a few   292   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  values specified on the spot, either by using the builder  , generate  , or iterate    methods or by using the of method, as depicted next.  IntStream intStream0 = IntStream.builder  .add 0 .add 1 .add 2 .add 5 .build  ;  IntStream intStream1 = IntStream.of 0,1,2,3,4,5 ;  An IntStream instance can be created by giving the start and end of an interval as  arguments to the range   and rangeClosed  . Both of them generate elements for the  stream, with a step of 1, only the last one includes the upper range of the interval as a value.  Figure 8-1.  Stream API interfaces  intStream2 = IntStream.range 0, 10 ;  intStream3 = IntStream.rangeClosed 0, 10 ;  Also, in Java 1.8 the java.util.Random class was enriched with a method named   ints that generates a stream of random integers. It declares a single argument that  represents the number of elements to be generated and put in the stream, but there is a  form of this method without the argument that generates an infinite stream.  Random random = new Random  ; intStream = random.ints 5 ;  All the methods mentioned for IntStream can generate LongStream instances,   because equivalent methods are defined in this interface. There are no range methods  for DoubleStream, but there is the of   method, builder  , generate   and so on.  Also, the java.util.Random class was enriched in Java 1.8 with the doubles   method  that generates a stream of random double values. It declares a single argument that   293   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  represents the number of elements to be generated and put in the stream, but there is  a form of this method without the argument that generates an infinite stream. In the  following code snippet, a few ways of creating streams of doubles are depicted.  DoubleStream doubleStream0 = DoubleStream.of 1, 2 , 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, 6 ;  Random random = new Random  ; DoubleStream doubleStream1 = random.doubles 3 ;  DoubleStream doubleStream2 = DoubleStream.iterate 2.5, d -> d = d + 0.2 . limit 10 ;  For streams of char values there is no special interface, but IntStream can be used   just fine.  source.  IntStream intStream = IntStream.of 'a','b','c','d' ; intStream.forEach c -> System.out.println  char  c  ;  Another way to create a stream of char values is to use a String instance as a stream   IntStream charStream = "sample".chars  ; charStream.forEach c -> System.out.println  char  c  ;  In Java 8, the java.util.regex.Pattern was enriched with stream specific methods   too; as a class used to process String instances, it is the proper place to add these  methods after all. A Pattern instance can be used to split an existing String instance  and return the pieces as a stream using the splitAsStream ..  method.  Stream  stringStream = Pattern.compile " "         .splitAsStream "live your life" ;  The contents of a file can also be returned as a stream of strings using the Files.  lines ..  utility method.  String inputPath = "chapter08 src main resources songs.csv"; Stream  stringStream = Files.lines Path.of inputPath  ;  The sections so far have shown you how to create all types of streams; the next   sections show you how to use them to process data.  294   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  If you feel the need to associate stream instances with real objects to make   !  sense of them, I recommend the following: imagine a finite stream like one created  from a collection  as the water dripping from a mug when inclined. the water in  the mug will end eventually, but while the water drips, it forms a stream. an infinite  stream is like a river that has a fountain head, it flows continuously.  well, unless a  serious drought dries the river, of course    A Short Introduction to Optional The java.util.Optional  instances are the Schrödinger2 boxes of the Java Language.  They are very useful because they can be used as a return type for methods to avoid  returning a null value, and cause either a possible NullPointerException to be thrown,  or the developer using the method to write extra code to treat the possibility of an  exception being thrown. Optional  instances can be created in similar way to streams.  There is an empty   method for creating an optional value of any type that does not   contain anything.  Optional  empty = Optional.empty  ;  There is an of   method used to wrap an existing object into an Optional .  Optional  value = Optional.of 5L ;  Considering that these type of instances were designed to not allow null values and   the way the Optional  instance was created previously, what would stop us to write  something like the following?  Song song = null; Optional  nullable = Optional.of song ;  The compiler wouldn’t, but when the code is executed at runtime, a NullPointer   Exception is thrown. Still, if we really need an Optional  instance to permit null  values, it is possible, there’s an utility method was introduced in Java 9 just for that.  Song song = null; Optional   nullable = Optional.ofNullable song ;  2 Read about it at https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat  295   Now that we have Optional  instances, what can we do with them? We use them.   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Let’s take a look at the following code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8;  import com.apress.bgn.ch8.util.MediaLoader; import com.apress.bgn.ch8.util.Song;  import java.util.List;  public class OptionalDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         List  songs = MediaLoader.loadSongs  ;         song = findFirst songs, "B.B. King" ;         if song != null && song.getSinger  .equals "The Thrill Is Gone"   {             System.out.println "Good stuff!" ;         } else {             System.out.println "not found!" ;         }     }      public static Song findFirst List  songs, String singer  {         for  Song song: songs  {             if  singer.equals song.getSinger     {                 return song;             }         }         return null;     } }  The findFirst ..  method looks for the first song in the list that has the singer equal  to “B.B. King”, returns it and prints a message if found, and another if not. You can notice  the nullability test and iteration of the list. In Java 8, both of them are no longer necessary.  Optional  opt = songs.stream        .filter s -> "B.B. King".equals s.getSinger         .findFirst  ; opt.ifPresent r -> System.out.println r.getTitle    ;  296   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  If the Optional  instance is not empty, the song title is printed, otherwise,   nothing is printed, and the code continues from that point on without an exception  being thrown. But what if we want to print something when the Optional  instance is  empty? In Java 11, we can do something about that, because a method named isEmpty    was introduced to test the Optional  instance contents.  Optional  opt = songs.stream        .filter s -> "B.B. King".equals s.getSinger         .findFirst  ; if opt.isEmpty    {     System.out.println "Not found!" ; }  But wait, this is a little bit... not right. Can’t we have a method to call on an   Optional  to get the exact behavior as an if-else statement? Well, that was possible  starting with Java 9; the ifPresentOrElse ..  that takes as arguments a consumer  to process the contents of the Optional  instance when is not empty and a Runner  instance to execute when the Optional  instance is empty.  Optional  opt = songs.stream          .filter ss -> "B.B. King".equals ss.getSinger    .findFirst  ; opt.ifPresentOrElse      r -> System.out.println r.getTitle   ,        -> System.out.println "Not found!"   ;  If the Optional  instance is not empty, its contents can be extracted by calling the   get   method.  Optional  opt2 = songs.stream      .filter ss -> "Rob Thomas".equals ss.getSinger        .findFirst  ; System.out.println "Found Song " + opt2.get   ;  The code does not print anything when the desired object is not found. But if we   want to print a default value for example, we can do that as well using a method named  orElse  .  297   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Optional  opt = songs.stream        .filter ss -> "B.B. King".equals ss.getSinger          .findFirst  ; opt.ifPresent r -> System.out.println r.getTitle    ;  Song defaultSong = new Song  ; defaultSong.setTitle "Untitled" ;  Song s = opt.orElse  defaultSong ; System.out.println "Found: " + s.getTitle   ;  If we were interested to throw a specific exception when the Optional  is empty,   there is a method for that as well, named orElseThrow ..   Optional  opt = songs.stream       .filter s -> "B.B. King".equals s.getSinger         .findFirst  ; Song song = opt.orElseThrow IllegalArgumentException::new ;  As you probably noticed in the code samples, Optional  and Stream  can be   combined to write practical code to solve complex solutions. As there are a lot of methods  that can be applied to Optional  and Stream  instances as well, the next sections  introduce them for streams and randomly make reference to Optional  as well.   How to Use Streams After creating a stream, the next thing is to process the data on the stream. The result  of that processing is another stream that can be further processed as many times as  needed. There are a few methods to use to process a stream and return the result as  another stream. These methods are called intermediate operations. The methods that  do not return a stream but actual data structures, or nothing, are named terminal  operations. All these are defined in the Stream interface. The key feature of streams is  that the processing of data using streams is only done when the terminal operation is  initiated and elements from source are consumed only as needed. So you could say that  the whole stream process is well, lazy. Lazy loading of source elements and processing  them when needed allows significant optimizations.  298   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  After the previous affirmations, you probably realized that the forEach method that   was used to print values from the streams is a terminal operation. But there are a few that  you’ll likely need for the most common implementations.  This chapter started with an example of Song instances, but the Song class was not   listed yet. You can see its contents in the following code listing.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8.util;  public class Song {     private Long id;     private String singer;     private String title;     private Integer duration;     private AudioType audioType;      ...   getters and setters     ...    toString }  following code snippet.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8.util;  public enum AudioType {     MP3,     FLAC,     OGG,     AAC,     M4A,     WMA }  The AudioType is an enum containing the types of audio files and is depicted in the   And now that the data type that is used on the following stream examples is depicted,   the data should be depicted as well. In the example in the book, the data is contained  into a file named songs.csv. The CSV extension denotes a comma separated file, and  each Song instance matches a line in the file. Each line contains all the property values  of each Song instance, separated by columns. Other separators can be used, semi-colons  were used here for practical reasons that is the default supported by the library reading  the data . The contents of the file are depicted next.  299   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  ID;SINGER;TITLE;DURATION;AUDIOTYPE 01;John Mayer;New Light;206;FLAC 02;John Mayer;My Stupid Mouth;225;M4A 03;John Mayer;Vultures;247;FLAC 04;John Mayer;Edge of Desire;333;MP3 05;John Mayer;In Repair;372;MP3 05;Rob Thomas;Paper Dolls;185;MP3 07;The Script;Mad Love;207;MP3 08;Seth MacFarlane;No One Ever Tells You;244;MP3 09;Nat King Cole;Orange Colored Sky;154;MP3 10;Vertical Horizon;Forever;246;MP3 11;Mario Lanza;Temptation;141;M4A 12;Jack Radics;No Matter;235;MP3 13;George Michael;Fastlove;306;MP3 14;Childish Gambino;Freaks And Geeks;227;M4A 15;Bill Evans;Lover Man;304;MP3 16;Darren Hayes;Like It Or Not;381;MP3 17;Stevie Wonder;Superstition;284;MP3 18;Tony Bennett;It Had To Be You;196;MP3 19;Tarja Turunen;An Empty Dream;322;MP3 20;Lykke Li;Little bit;231;M4A  Each line in the file is transformed into a Song instance by using classes in a library  named Josefa.3 This library is not the topic of this book, but if you are interested, you  can use the link in the footnote to get more information from the official site.   Terminal Functions: forEach and forEachOrdered And now we are ready to start playing with streams. Assuming the songs stream provides  all instances declared, let’s first print all the elements on the stream.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8;  import com.apress.bgn.ch8.util.Song; import com.apress.bgn.ch8.util.StreamMediaLoader;  3 JSefa  Java Simple exchange format API  is a simple library for stream-based serialization of Java  objects to XML, CSV, and FLR. More about it at http:  jsefa.sourceforge.net   300   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  import java.util.List; import java.util.stream.Stream;  public class MediaStreamTester {     public static void main String... args  {         Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ;         songs.forEach song -> System.out.println song  ;     } }  Because we are using Java 11 by now, we can make use of method references  introduced in Java 8. Method references are a shortcut for cases when a lambda  expression does nothing else than call a method, so the method can be referred by name  directly. So this line  songs.forEach song -> System.out.println song  ;  becomes  songs.forEach System.out::println ;  The forEach ..  method receives an instance of Consumer  as an argument. In   the two previous examples, the implementation of the accept   method contained only  a call to System.out.println song  and that is why the code is so compact, but if the  implementation of this method would contain more statements then the compact code  previously written would not be possible.  Instead of printing the songs directly, let’s first uppercase the singer name. The code   would look like this:  songs.forEach new Consumer    {    @Override     public void accept Song song  {           song.setSinger song.getSinger  .toUpperCase   ;           System.out.println song ;   } } ;  301   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Of course, it can be simplified using lambda expressions.  songs.forEach song -> {      song.setSinger song.getSinger  .toUpperCase   ;      System.out.println song ;  } ;  The sister function, forEachOrdered .. , does the same thing as forEach .. , with   one little difference, ensure that the elements on the stream is processed element is  processed in encounter order, if such order is defined, even if the stream is a parallel one.  So basically the following two lines, print the songs in the same order.  songs.forEach System.out::println ; songs.parallel  .forEachOrdered System.out::println ;   Intermediate Operation filter and Terminal Operation  toArray In the following example, we select all MP3 songs and save them to an array. Selecting  all MP3 songs is done using the filter ..  method. This method receives an argument  of type Predicate  that defines a condition that the elements of the stream  must pass to be put into the array that results by calling the terminal method named  toArray .. .  The toArray ..  receives an argument of type IntFunction . This type of  function takes an integer as argument and generates an array of that size, which is  populated by the toArray   method.  The code to filter the MP3 entries and put them into an array of type Song[] is   depicted next.  Song sarray = songs.filter s -> s.getAudioType   == AudioType.MP3          .toArray Song::new ;  302   Chapter 8    the Stream apI   Intermediate Operations map and flatMap and Terminal  Operation collect In the following example we process all the songs and calculate the duration in  minutes. To do this, we use the map method to associate each song with the method  processing it. This result is a stream of Integer values. All of its elements are added to a  List  using the collect ..  method. This method accumulates the elements  as they are processed into a Collection instance.  package com.apress.bgn.ch8.util; public class SongTransformer {     public static int processDuration Song song  {         int secs = song.getDuration  ;         return secs 60;     } } ... List  durationAsMinutes =  songs     .map SongTransformer::processDuration      .collect Collectors.toList   ;  The map ..  method receives an argument of type Function  which is basically   a reference to a function to apply on each element of the stream. The function we  applied in the previous example takes a song element from the stream, gets its duration  and transforms it into minutes and returns it.  The reference to it can be written as  Function  fct = SongTransformer::processDuration;  The first generic type is the type of the element processed and the second is the type   of the result returned.  A version of the filter method is defined for the Optional type and can be used to   avoid writing complicated if statements, together with the map method. Let’s assume we  have a Song instance and we want to check if it is more than three minutes and less than  10 minutes long. Instead of writing an if statement with two conditions connected by an  AND operator, we can use an Optional  and those two methods to do the same.  303   Chapter 8    the Stream apI   public static boolean isMoreThan3Mins Song song  {     return Optional.ofNullable song         .map SongTransformer::processDuration         .filter d -> d >= 3         .filter d -> d <= 10         .isPresent  ; }  So, the map ..  is quite powerful, but it has a small flaw. If we take a look at its   signature in the Stream.java file, this is what we see:    Stream  map Function  mapper ;  So, if the map function is applied to each element in the stream and returns a   stream with the result, which is placed into another stream that contains all results,  the collect ...  method is called on a Stream >. The same goes  for Optional , the terminal method is called on a  >>.  When the objects are simple, like we have here Song instances, the map ..  method  works quite well, but if the objects in the original stream are more complex, let’s say a  List >, things get complicated. In a case like this the map method should  be replaced with flatMap. The easiest way to show the effects of the flatMap ..  is to  apply it exactly on a List >. Let’s take a look at the following example.  List > testList = List.of  List.of 2,3 , List.of 4,5 ,   List.of 6,7  ; System.out.println processList testList  ; ... public static List  processList  List > list  {     List  result = list        .stream          .flatMap Collection::stream         .collect Collectors.toList   ;     return result; }  The flatMap ..  method receives as argument a reference to a method that  takes a collection and transforms it into a stream, the most simple way to create  a Stream >. The flatMap ..  does its magic and the result is   304   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  transformed into  > and the elements are then collected by the  collect method into a List . The operation of removing the useless stream  wrapper is called flattening.  Another way to see the effect of the flatMap ..  method is to write a simpler   example with Optional. Let’s say we need a function that transforms a string into an  integer and if the string is not a valid number we want to avoid returning null. This  means that our function must take a string and return Optional .  Function > toIntOpt = OptionalDemo::toIntOpt;  ... public static Optional  toIntOpt String string  {         try {             return Optional.of Integer.parseInt string  ;         } catch  NumberFormatException e  {             return Optional.empty  ;         } }  Now that we have our function, let’s use it.  Optional  str = Optional.of "42" ; Optional > resInt = str.map toIntOpt ;     flatten it Optional  desiredRes = resInt.orElse Optional.empty   ; System.out.println "finally: " + desiredRes.get   ;  If we want to get to the Optional instance that we are really interested in, we have to  get rid of the external Optional wrapper. If we use flatMap .. , we do not need to do that.  Optional  str = Optional.of "42" ; Optional  desiredRes = str.flatMap toIntOpt ; System.out.println "boom: " + desiredRes.get   ;  So yeah, there is a slight difference between these two methods, which you probably   would have never investigated; as in most cases when working with streams the map    method is usually terminated with collect .. .  305    the Stream apI  Chapter 8   Intermediate Operation sorted and Terminal Operation  findFirst As the name says the sorted   method has something to do with sorting. When called  on a stream, it creates another stream with all the elements of the initial stream, but  sorted in their natural order. If the type of elements on the stream is not comparable  the  type does not implement java.lang.Comparable, a java.lang.ClassCastException is  thrown . And since we are going to use this method to get a stream of sorted elements,  we use findFirst   to get the first element in the stream. This method returns an  Optional , because the stream might be empty.  List  pieces = List.of "some","of", "us", "we’re", "hardly",   "ever", "here" ; String first = pieces.stream  .sorted  .findFirst  .get  ; System.out.println "First from sorted list: " + first ;  This code prints ever because that is the first element in the sorted stream.   Intermediate Operation distinct and Terminal Operation  count The distinct   method takes a stream and generates a stream with all the distinct  elements of the original stream. And because we need a terminal function, let’s use  count  ; as the name says, this function counts the elements of the stream.  List  pieces = List.of "as","long", "as", "there", "is",        "you", "there", "is", "me" ; long count = pieces.stream  .distinct  .count  ; System.out.println "Elements in the stream: " + count ;  If the code is run, the number printed is 6, because after removing the duplicate   terms  as, there, is , we are left with six terms.  306   Chapter 8    the Stream apI   Intermediate Operation limit and Terminal Operations  min and max The limit ..  method was used in this chapter before to transform a infinite stream into  a finite one. As it transforms a stream into another stream, clearly this is an intermediate  function. To see it in action, we will use a stream of integers and we’ll use as terminal  methods two mathematical functions: to calculate the minimum of the elements in the  stream - min   and to calculate the maximum of the elements fn the stream - max  .   How to use these functions together is depicted in the following code snippet.  Stream  ints = Stream.of 5,2,7,9,8,1,12,7,2 ; ints.limit 4 .min Integer::compareTo         .ifPresent min -> System.out.println "Min is: " + min  ;    Prints "Min is: 2"  Stream  ints = Stream.of 5,2,7,9,8,1,12,7,2 ; ints.limit 4 .max Integer::compareTo         .ifPresent max -> System.out.println "Max is: " + max  ;    Prints "Max is: 9"   Terminal Operations sum and reduce Let’s consider the scenario: we have a finite stream of Song values and we want to  calculate the sum of their durations. The code to do this is depicted in the following  listing, and the use of another stream terminal function that can be used only on  numeric streams.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; Integer totalDuration = songs         .mapToInt Song::getDuration          .sum  ;  The same result can be obtained using the reduce ..  function.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; Integer totalDuration = songs        .mapToInt Song::getDuration         .reduce 0,  a, b  -> a + b ;  307   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  The reduce functions takes two arguments.     The identity argument represented the initial version of the   reduction and the default result if there are no elements in the stream     The accumulator function takes two parameters; the operation is   applied on to get a partial result  in this case is the addition of those  two elements   So basically, every time an element of the stream is processed, the accumulator returns   a new value that is the result of adding the processed element with the previous partial  result. So, if the result of the process is a collection, the accumulator’s result is a collection,  so every time a stream element is processed a new collection would be created. This is  pretty inefficient, so in scenarios like this the collect function is more suitable.   Intermediate Operation peek This function is special because it really doesn’t affect the stream results in any way.  The peek function returns a stream consisting of the elements of the stream it is called  on while also performing for each element the operation specified by its Consumer   argument. This means that this function can be used to debug stream operations.  Let’s take our stream of Song instances and filter them by their duration. Select all the  ones with a duration >300 seconds, and then get their titles and collect them in a list. The  following code shows how to do this.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; List  result = songs.filter s -> s.getDuration   > 300       .map Song::getTitle       .collect Collectors.toList   ;  Before the map call, a peek call can be introduced to check if the filtered elements are the   ones you expect. Another peek call can be introduced after to inspect the mapped value.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; List  result = songs.filter s -> s.getDuration   > 300       .peek e -> System.out.println "\t Filtered value: " + e        .map Song::getTitle       .peek e -> System.out.println "\t Mapped value: " + e        .collect Collectors.toList   ;  308   Chapter 8    the Stream apI   Intermediate Operation skip and Terminal Operations  findAny, anyMatch, allMatch, and noneMatch These are the last operations discussed in this chapter, so they are coupled together  because the skip operation might affect the result of the others.  The findAny   returns an Optional  instance that contains the first element of   the stream or an empty Optional  instance when the stream is empty. When the  stream is parallel, the function returns a random element of the stream wrapped into an  Optional . Because the stream of songs we’ve been using so far is not a parallel one,  we create a parallel stream by calling the intermediate function parallel  .  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; Optional  optSong = songs.parallel  .findAny  ; optSong.ifPresent System.out::println ;  The anyMatch ..  method receives an argument of type Predicate  and returns  a boolean true value if there is any elements in the stream that match the predicate, and  false otherwise. It works on parallel streams as well. The scenario the next code covers  is to return true id any of the songs in our stream has a title containing the word Paper.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; boolean b = songs         .anyMatch s -> s.getTitle  .contains "Paper"  ; System.out.println "Are there songs with title containing 'Paper'? " + b ;  The code prints true because there is song on the list called Paper Dolls. But, if we   want to change that result, all we have to do is skip processing the first six elements in the  original stream by calling skip 6 . Yes, this method works on parallel streams as well.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; boolean b = songs.parallel           .skip 6          .anyMatch s -> s.getTitle  .contains "Paper"  ; System.out.println "Are there songs with title containing \"Paper\"? " + b ;  And so, if the first six elements in the original stream were not processed, now   the previous code returns false. There is another function that analyses all elements  of a stream checking if they all match a single predicate, and that method is called   309   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  allMatch .. . In the next code sample, we check if all Song instances have duration  bigger than 300. The function returns a boolean, and the value is true of all Song  instances match the predicate and false otherwise. For our example, we are obviously  expecting a false value, because not all of our Song instances have the duration field  value bigger than 300.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; boolean b = songs.allMatch s -> s.getDuration   > 300 ; System.out.println "Are all songs longer than 5 minutes? " + b ;  The pair of this function is a function named noneMatch and does exactly the   opposite thing: takes a predicate as an argument and returns a boolean. The value of  this boolean is true if none of the stream elements match the predicate provided as  argument, and false otherwise. In the next code sample, we check using the noneMatch  if there is no Song instance with duration > 300 and we expect the result to be false.  Stream  songs = StreamMediaLoader.loadSongs  ; boolean b = songs.noneMatch s -> s.getDuration   > 300 ; System.out.println "Are all songs shorter than 5 minutes? " + b ;   Debugging Stream Code The peek ..  method can be used for a light debugging, more like logging the changes  that happen on stream elements between one stream method call and another. A more  advanced way to debug streams is provided by the IntelliJ IDEA editor; starting on May  11, 2017, this editor includes a specialized plugin, called the Java Stream Debugger, for  stream debugging.4  I am assuming that you already have a version of IntelliJ IDEA that is more recent   than 2017, so you should already have this plugin. To use it, you have to place a  breakpoint on the line where a stream processing chain is defined. Figure 8-2 shows  a piece of code representing the processing of a stream of Song instances executed in  debug and a breakpoint paused the execution in line 44. When the execution is paused  the Stream debugger view can be opened by clicking the button that is surrounded in the  red rectangle.  4 Official blogpost from JetBrains, the company that created and maintains IntelliJ IDEA https:   plugins.jetbrains.com  plugin 9696-java-stream-debugger?platform=hootsuite  310   Figure 8-2.  Debugging  If you click the debugger button shown in Figure 8-2, a pop-up window appears; it   has a tab for each operation of the stream processing. Figure 8-3 shows the tabs and their  methods underlined and linked to each other.  Chapter 8    the Stream apI  311   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Figure 8-3.  The Java Stream Debugger window  In each of the tabs, the text box on the left contains the elements on the original   stream and on the text box on the right contains the resulting stream with its elements.  For operations that reduce the number of elements or change their order there are lines  from one set of elements to the other. The first map method transforms the song titles to  their uppercase versions. The second map method transforms the duration of the songs  in minutes and returns a stream of integers. The distinct method produces a new  stream that contains only the distinct elements, and this operation’s effect is depicted  nicely in Figure 8-4.  312   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Figure 8-4.  The distinct   operation in the IntelliJ IDEA stream debugger  The next operation is sorted   that sort the entries on the stream returned by the   distinct   operation. The reordering of the elements and adding them to a new stream  is depicted in the debugger also and in Figure 8-5.  Figure 8-5.  The sorted   operation in the IntelliJ IDEA stream debugger  313   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  Of course, after inspecting the results in the debugger, even if you want to continue   the execution, this won’t be possible, because all elements in the original stream and the  resulting ones were consumed by the debugger, so the following exception is printed in  the console.

I like three things best: more compact and simple  code can be written to solve problems without losing readability  ifs and loops can be  avoided , parallel processing of data is possible without the boilerplate code required  before Java 8 and the fact that code can be written in Functional Programming style.  Also, the Stream API is more a declarative way of programming as most stream methods  take arguments of type Consumer , Predicate , or Function , which declare what  should be done for each stream element, but the methods are not explicitly called from  the developer written code.  314   Chapter 8    the Stream apI  This chapter also covered how to use Optional  instances to avoid   NullPointerExceptions and writing if statements.  After you finished reading this chapter, you should have a pretty good idea about the   following.     how to create sequential and parallel streams from collections     what empty streams are useful for      terms to remember about streams:   – sequence of elements   – predicate   – consumer   – supplier   – method reference   – source   – aggregate operations   – intermediate operation   – terminal operation   – pipelining   – internal automatic iterations     how to create and use Optional instances  315   CHAPTER 9  Debugging, Testing,  and Documenting  Development work does not only require you to write design the solution for a problem  and write the code for it. To make sure your solution solves the problem, you have to test  it. Testing involves making sure every component making up your solution behaves as  expected in expected and unexpected situations.  The most practical way to test code is to inspect values of intermediary variables by   logging them; print them in the console only in specific situations.  When a solution is complex, debugging provides the opportunity to pause the   execution and inspect state of the variables. Debugging sometimes involves breakpoints  and requires an IDE. Breakpoints are points where the application pauses its execution,  and the inspection of variables can be performed.  After making sure your solution fits the requirements, you have to document it,   especially if the problem that is being solved is one that requires complex code to  solve it. Or if your solution might be a prerequisite for other applications, it is your  responsibility to explain other developers how to use it.  This chapter covers a few ways to do all these, because these are key talents for a   developer.   Debugging Debugging is a process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer  program. There are more debugging tactics, and depending of the complexity of an  application, one or more can be used. The following is a list of those techniques.      logging intermediary states of objects involved in the process and  analyzing log files    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_9  317               testing  Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  interactive debugging using breakpoints to pause the execution of the  program and inspect intermediary states of objects involved in the  process     monitoring at the application or system level  analysis of memory dumps item profiling, a form of dynamic  program analysis that measures the memory occupied by a program,  or CPU used, duration of method calls, and so forth.  Let’s start with the simplest way of debugging: logging.   Logging In the real world, logging is a destructive process; it is the cutting and processing of trees  to produce timber. In software programming, logging means writing log files that can be  later used to identify problems in code. The simplest way to log information is to use the  System.out.print method family, as depicted in Figure 9-1.  Figure 9-1.  System.out.print class family  318   For the examples in this chapter, we use a hierarchy of classes that provide methods   to sort integer arrays. The class hierarchy is depicted in Figure 9-2.  Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-2.  Sorting class hierarchy  We’ll take first the MergeSort class and add System.out.print statements to log  the steps of the algorithm. Merge sort is the name of a sorting algorithm with a better  performance than bubble sort, and it works by splitting the array into two halves, then  into smaller pieces, until it gets to the arrays of two elements that can be easily sorted.  Then it starts merging the array pieces. This approach, of splitting the array repeatedly  until sorting becomes a manageable operation is called Divide et Impera also known  as divide and conquer. There are more algorithms that follow the same approach for  solving a problem and merge sort is only the first of them that is covered in this book.  Figure 9-3, shows what happens in every step of the merge-sort algorithm that we are  going to implement.  319   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-3.  Merge sort  In each step of the algorithm the middle of the array is identified, and as long as the   start index of the array the low value is smaller than the end index of the array to sort,  the high value, we further split the array by calling the sort ..  method until we get  to an array with one element. That is when the merge ..  method is called, aside from  merging pieces of the array, it also sorts them during the merging. To write the code, we  need to implement the two methods.  Listing 9-1.  Logging with System.out.print  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs;  public class MergeSort implements IntSorter {      public void sort int[] arr, int low, int high  {         if  low < high  {             int middle =  low + high    2;             sort arr, low, middle ;             sort arr, middle + 1, high ;             merge arr, low, middle, high ;  320   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting          }     }      private void merge int arr[], int low, int middle, int high  {         int leftLength = middle - low + 1;         int rightLength = high - middle;          int left[] = new int[leftLength];         int right[] = new int[rightLength];          for  int i = 0; i < leftLength; ++i  {             left[i] = arr[low + i];         }         for  int i = 0; i < rightLength; ++i  {             right[i] = arr[middle + 1 + i];         }          int i = 0, j = 0;          int k = low;         while  i < leftLength && j < rightLength  {             if  left[i] <= right[j]  {                 arr[k] = left[i];                 i++;             } else {                 arr[k] = right[j];                 j++;             }             k++;         }          while  i < leftLength  {             arr[k] = left[i];             i++;             k++;         }          while  j < rightLength  {             arr[k] = right[j];  321   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting              j++;             k++;         }     } }  This code might look scary, but it does exactly what is depicted in Figure 9-3; we just  need a lot of variables to refer all the indexes we are using to arrange our elements in the  proper order. To make sure our solution is properly implemented, it would be useful to  see the values each method is called with and the array pieces that are being handled.  We can do this by simply modifying our methods and adding a few System.out.print  method calls.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs;  public class MergeSort implements IntSorter {      public void sort int[] arr, int low, int high  {          System.out.print "Call sort of " + ": [" + low + " " + high + "] " ;         for  int i = low; i <= high; ++i  {             System.out.print arr[i] + " " ;         }           System.out.println  ;         if  low < high  {             int middle =  low + high    2;             sort arr, low, middle ;             sort arr, middle + 1, high ;             merge arr, low, middle, high ;         }     }      private void merge int arr[], int low, int middle, int high  {         int leftLength = middle - low + 1;         int rightLength = high - middle;          int left[] = new int[leftLength];         int right[] = new int[rightLength];  322   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting          for  int i = 0; i < leftLength; ++i  {             left[i] = arr[low + i];         }         for  int i = 0; i < rightLength; ++i  {             right[i] = arr[middle + 1 + i];         }          int i = 0, j = 0;          int k = low;         while  i < leftLength && j < rightLength  {             if  left[i] <= right[j]  {                 arr[k] = left[i];                 i++;             } else {                 arr[k] = right[j];                 j++;             }             k++;         }          while  i < leftLength  {             arr[k] = left[i];             i++;             k++;         }          while  j < rightLength  {             arr[k] = right[j];             j++;             k++;         }          System.out.print "Called merge of: [" + low                     + " " + high + " " + middle + "], " ;          for  int z = low; z <= high; ++z  {             System.out.print arr[z] + " " ;         }  323   To test the output we need a class containing a main ..  method to execute the   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting           System.out.println  ;      } }  algorithm.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.IntSorter; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.MergeSort;  import java.util.Arrays;  public class SortingDemo {      public static void main String... args  {         int arr[] = {5,1,4,2,3};          IntSorter mergeSort = new MergeSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length-1 ;          System.out.print "Sorted: " ;         Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> System.out.print i+ " "  ;     } }  If we run the preceding class, the intermediary values handled by sort ..  and   merge ..  calls are printed in the console.  Call sort of : [0 4] 5 1 4 2 3 Call sort of : [0 2] 5 1 4 Call sort of : [0 1] 5 1 Call sort of : [0 0] 5 Call sort of : [1 1] 1 Called merge of: [0 1 0], 1 5 Call sort of : [2 2] 4 Called merge of: [0 2 1], 1 4 5  324   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Call sort of : [3 4] 2 3 Call sort of : [3 3] 2 Call sort of : [4 4] 3 Called merge of: [3 4 3], 2 3 Called merge of: [0 4 2], 1 2 3 4 5 Sorted: 1 2 3 4 5  You can see that the console output matches the algorithm steps depicted in   Figure 9-3; that output is clearly proof that the solution works as expected. But, there is  a problem with the code now. Every time the sort ..  method is called, the output is  printed, and if the sorting is only one step in a more complex solution, the output is not  really necessary. It can even pollute the output of the bigger solution. Also, if the array  is big, printing that output could affect the performance of the overall solution. So, a  different approach should be considered, one that could be customized and decision  made if the output should be printed or not. This is where logging libraries come in.   Logging with JUL  The JDK provides its own logger classes that are hosted under package java.util. logging that is why the logging module provided by the JDK is also called JUL. A Logger  class instance is used to log messages. The logger instance should be provided a name  when is created and log messages are printed by calling specialized methods that print  messages at different levels. For the JUL module, the levels and their scope are listed  next, but other logging libraries have similar logging levels.     OFF - should be used to turn off all logging     SEVERE – is the highest level, message indicates a serious failure     WARNING - indicates that this message is being printed because of a   potential problem  information      INFO - indicates that this is an informational message     CONFIG - indicates that this is a message containing configuration      FINE - indicates that this a message providing tracing information     FINER - indicates that this is a fairly detailed tracing message  325   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting     FINEST - indicates that this is a very detailed tracing message     ALL - all log messages should be printed  Loggers can be configured using XML or properties files and their output can be  directed to external files. For the code sample introduced previously, let’s replace all  System.out.print method calls with logger calls. Let’s start with the SorterJulDemo class.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.IntSorter; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.MergeSort;  import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.logging.Logger;  public class SortingJulDemo {      private static final Logger log =           Logger.getLogger SortingJulDemo.class.getName   ;      public static void main String... args  {         int arr[] = {5,1,4,2,3};          log.info "Sorting  an array with merge sort" ;         IntSorter mergeSort = new MergeSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length-1 ;          StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder "Sorted: " ;         Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb.append i .append " "  ;         log.info sb.toString   ;     } }  In the code sample, a Logger instance was created by calling the static method   Logger.getLogger .. . The recommended practice is for the logger to be named as  the class it is logging messages for. Without any additional configuration, every message  printed with log.info ..  is printed prefixed with the full system date, class name,  and method name in front of it. Let’s replace all System.out.print method calls with  logger calls in the MergeSort class, and introduces a StringBuilder to construct longer  messages before writing them with log.info .. .  326   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs;  import java.util.logging.Logger;  public class MergeSort implements IntSorter {     private static final Logger log =            Logger.getLogger SortingJulDemo.class.getName   ;      public void sort int[] arr, int low, int high  {         StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder "Call sort of "                  .append ": ["                      .append low .append " " .append high                  .append "] " ;         for  int i = low; i <= high; ++i  {             sb.append arr[i] .append " " ;         }         log.info sb.toString   ;          if  low < high  {              int middle =  low + high    2;                sort lower half of the interval             sort arr, low, middle ;               sort upper half of the interval             sort arr, middle + 1, high ;                 merge the two intervals             merge arr, low, middle, high ;         }     }      private void merge int arr[], int low, int middle, int high  {         ...

When  an explicit configuration is missing, the default formatter used is java.util.logging. SimpleFormatter that prints log messages exactly as shown in the previous listing. The  messages are printed by default in the console and the class used for that is called a handler,  and is java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler in this case. Both of these are configurable and  can be replaced via a configuration file with more advanced classes or custom classes. The previous log seems a little crowded and is not really clear. So, we must refine   it by adding a proper configuration. The StreamFormatter class contains a field  named format that can be initialized with a template for how the log messages should  be written. So, let’s remove the class and method name altogether because we have  really specific messages in place anyway. The following code listing contains a simple  configuration for JUL.  handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler .level=ALL java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=ALL java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.

The XML format of writing data is defined by a set of rules for encoding the  data that is both human-readable and machine readable. Also, the set of rules makes it  easy to validate and find errors.1 And since for XML it makes no sense to be written in  the console, let’s use the FileHandler class to save the logs to a file.

The logging output can be customized also by providing a custom class, the only   condition is for the class to extend the java.util.logging.Formatter class, or any of its  JDK subclasses.  In the previous sample, we only had log.info calls because the code is basic   and leaves no room for error; but let’s modify the code to allow the user to insert the  elements of the array. This requires code to be written to treat situations when the user  does not insert proper data. Code to treat the case when the user does not provide any  data and code to treat the case when user inserts bad data should be added to the class.  If the user does not provide any data, a SEVERE log message should be printed and the  application should terminate. If the user introduces invalid data, the valid data should be  used and warning should be printed for elements that are not integers.  331   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  This means that the SortingJulDemo class becomes  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.IntSorter; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.MergeSort;  import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List; import java.util.logging.Level; import java.util.logging.LogManager; import java.util.logging.Logger;  public class SortingJulDemo {      private static final Logger log =                Logger.getLogger SortingJulDemo.class.getName   ;      static {         try {             LogManager logManager = LogManager.getLogManager  ;             logManager.readConfiguration new FileInputStream                   ". chapter09 logging-jul src main resources logging.  properties"  ;          } catch  IOException exception  {              log.log Level.SEVERE, "Error in loading configuration",   exception ;          }     }      public static void main String... args  {         if  args.length == 0  {             log.severe  "No data to sort!" ;             return;          }         int[] arr = getInts args ;  332   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting          final StringBuilder sb = new             StringBuilder "Sorting  an array with merge sort: " ;          Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb.append i .append " "  ;         log.info sb.toString   ;          IntSorter mergeSort = new MergeSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length - 1 ;          final StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder "Sorted: " ;         Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb2.append i .append  " "  ;         log.info sb2.toString   ;     }      private static int[] getInts String[] args  {          List  list = new ArrayList   ;         for  String arg : args  {             try {                 int toInt = Integer.parseInt arg ;                 list.add toInt ;             } catch  NumberFormatException nfe  {                  log.warning  "Element " + arg + " is not an                     integer and cannot be added to the array!" ;              }         }         int[] arr = new int[list.size  ];         int j = 0;         for  Integer elem : list  {             arr[j++] = elem;         }         return arr;     } }  333   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  The arr array is no longer hardcoded in the main ..  method, but the values that   this method receives as arguments become the array to be sorted and are converted  from String values to int values by the toInts ..  method.

The log levels have   integer values assigned to them, and those values can be used to compare the severity  of the messages. As a rule, if you configure a certain level of messages, more severe  messages are printed. So, if we set that property to INFO, warning messages are printed.  The values for the severity levels of messages are defined in the java.util.logging. Level class, and if you open that class in your editor, you can see the integer values  assigned to each of them.  ...      public static final Level OFF = new Level "OFF",Integer.MAX_VALUE,        public static final Level SEVERE = new Level "SEVERE",1000,        public static final Level WARNING = new Level "WARNING", 900,       public static final Level INFO = new Level "INFO", 800, defaultBundle ;      public static final Level CONFIG = new Level "CONFIG", 700,       public static final Level FINE = new Level "FINE", 500, defaultBundle ;      public static final Level FINER = new Level "FINER", 400,        public static final Level FINEST = new Level "FINEST", 300,   defaultBundle ;  defaultBundle ;  defaultBundle ;  defaultBundle ;  defaultBundle ;  defaultBundle ;  ...

It really depends on the specifics of the application, but you might consider other  options for logging, because JUL is known for its weak performance in multithreaded  environments and most production applications use some other libraries. But when  Java 7 was released, one of the announced features was improvements to the JUL module,  so it might deserve a chance nowadays.  Another thing you have to take into account is that if the application you are building   is a complex one, with a lot of dependencies, these dependencies might use different  logging libraries, how do you configure and use them all? This is where a logging facade  proves useful. And the next section shows you how to use the most renowned Java  logging facade: SLF4J.   Logging with SLF4J and Logback The most renowned Java logging facade is SLF4J2 that serves as a logging abstraction for  various logging frameworks. This means that you use the SLF4J classes, and behind the  scenes all the work is done by a logging concrete implementation found in the classpath.  The best part? You can change the logging implementation anytime, and your code still  compiles and executes correctly, and there is no need to change anything in it.  In the code samples covered until now in this chapter, the code is seriously tied to  JUL, if we want for some reason to change the logging library, we need to change the  existing code as well. The first step is to change our code to use the SLF4J classes. Another  advantage of using SLF4J is that the configuration is automatically read if the logging  configuration file is on the classpath. So, the LogManager initialization block that we  needed for JUL is not needed anymore, as long as the configuration file is named according  to the standard of the concrete logging implementation used. So, let’s see the code first.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.logging.Logger;  2 Simple Logging Facade for Java  SLF4J  official site https:  www.slf4j.org   337   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  public class SortingJulDemo {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger SortingSlf4jDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         if  args.length == 0  {             log.error  "No data to sort!" ;             return;         }          int[] arr = getInts args ;          final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder                 "Sorting  an array with merge sort: " ;          Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb.append i .append " "  ;         log.debug  sb.toString   ;          IntSorter mergeSort = new MergeSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length - 1 ;          final StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder "Sorted: " ;         Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb2.append i .append  " "  ;         log.info  sb2.toString   ;     } }  As you’ve probably noticed, the methods we are calling are a little bit different, which    is because SLF4J defines an API that maps to the concrete implementation, but the  methods depending on their names they are used to print log messages with specific  purposes and at specific levels. I’ll list them and provide a short explanation for each.      info.error ..  logs messages at the ERROR level; usually these  are messages that are used when there is a critical failure of the  application and normal execution cannot continue. There is more  than one form for this method, and exceptions and objects can be  passed as arguments to it so that the state of the application at the  moment of the failure can be assessed.  338   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting                  info.warn ..  logs messages at the WARN level; usually these  messages are printed to notify that the application is not functioning  normally and there might be reason to worry, in the same way as  the previous method, there is more than one form of for it, and  exceptions and objects can be passed as arguments to better assess  the current state of the application.  log.info ..  logs messages at the INFO level; this type of messages  is informational to let the user know that everything is OK.  info.debug ..  logs messages at the DEBUG level; usually these  messages are used to print intermediary states of the application and  to check that things are going as expected; and in case of a failure,  you can trace the evolution of the application objects.  log.trace ..  logs messages at the TRACE level; this type of  messages is informational of a very low importance.  The logging concrete implementation used for this example is called Logback,3   which was chosen because it is the only library that works with SLF4J after the modules  were introduced in Java 9. Logback is viewed as the successor of Log4j, another popular  logging implementation, and it makes sense since the team that created it also worked  on Log4j.4 Logback implements SLF4J natively, so there is no need to add another bridge  library. And it is faster because the Logback internals have been rewritten to perform  faster on critical execution points. After modifying our classes to use SLF4J, all we have to  do is add Logback as a dependency of our application and add a configuration file under  the resources directory. The configuration file can be written in XML or Groovy. The  standard requires for it to be named logback.xml. The next listing depicts the contents  of this file for this sections’ example.                                    %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{5} - %msg%n   3 Logback official site https:  logback.qos.ch 4 Log4j official site https:  logging.apache.org log4j  339   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting                                                   The ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender class is used for writing log messages   in the console and the   element defines the format of the log messages.  Logback can format fully qualified class names by shortening package names to their  initials thus, it allows for a compact logging without losing information. This makes  Logback one of the favorite logging implementation of the Java development world at the  moment.  The logging calls in the MergeSort class were all replaced with log.debug ..    because these messages are intermediary and not really informational, just samples of  the state of the objects used by the application during the execution of the process. The  general logging level of the application can be set using a   element to the desired  level, but different logging levels can be set for classes or packages using    elements.  So, if we run the SortingSlf4jDemo class with the previous configuration on the   classpath, this is what is printed:  19:38:57.950 WARN  c.a.b.c.SortingSlf4jDemo -      Element a is not an integer and cannot be added to the array! 19:38:57.951 WARN  c.a.b.c.SortingSlf4jDemo -      Element b is not an integer and cannot be added to the array! 19:38:57.951 WARN  c.a.b.c.SortingSlf4jDemo -      Element ds is not an integer and cannot be added to the array! 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.SortingSlf4jDemo - Sorting  an array with merge  sort: 5 3 2 1 4 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [0 4] 5 3 2 1 4 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [0 2] 5 3 2 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [0 1] 5 3 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [0 0] 5  340   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [1 1] 3 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Called merge of: [0 1 0],  3 5 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [2 2] 2 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Called merge of: [0 2 1],  2 3 5 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [3 4] 1 4 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [3 3] 1 19:38:57.953 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Call sort of : [4 4] 4 19:38:57.954 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Called merge of: [3 4 3],  1 4 19:38:57.954 DEBUG c.a.b.c.a.MergeSort - Called merge of: [0 4 2],  1 2 3 4 5 19:38:57.954 INFO  c.a.b.c.SortingSlf4jDemo - Sorted: 1 2 3 4 5  The fully qualified class name com.apress.bgn.ch9.SortingSlf4jDemo was   shortened to c.a.b.c.SortingSlf4jDemo.  The configuration file can be provided to the program as a VM argument, which   means logging format can be configured externally. When launching the class, use  -Dlogback.configurationFile=\temp\ext-logback.xml as a VM argument.  Logback can direct output to a file as well; all we have to do is add a configuration   using the ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender class and direct the output to the file by  adding an   element in the   configuration.                      chapter09 logging-slf4j out output.log           true                         %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{5} - %msg%n                                                UTF-8               %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{5} - %msg%n                   341   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting                                            In this example, we kept the original configuration because I wanted to give you a   working example of log messages written to two destinations at once. But what if the log  file becomes too big to open? Well, there’s an approach for that. We can use a different  class, which can be configured to write a file to a configured limit in size and then start  another file. This class is named ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender  and requires two arguments: an instance of a type that implements ch.qos.logback. core.rolling.RollingPolicy, which provides functionality to write a new log file  also  called a rollover  and an instance of a type that implements ch.qos.logback.core. rolling.TriggeringPolicy that configures the conditions under which the rollover  happens.  Also, a single instance of a type that implements both of the interfaces can configure   the logger. Rolling over a log file means that the log file is renamed according to the  configuration; usually, the last date that the file was accessed is added to its name,  and a new log file is created, with the log file named configured   without any date  information .          <appender name="r_file" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.  RollingFileAppender">         chapter09 logging-slf4j out output.log                                  chapter09 logging-slf4j out output_%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log              342   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting            <timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy                 class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP">                  10MB                         30                                        UTF-8               %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{5} - %msg%n                                                %d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{5} - %msg%n                                                             So, the   element configures the location and the name of the log file. The     element configures the name the log file receive when log messages  no longer be written in it using the  . In the previous configuration,  the output.log file is renamed to output_2018-07-22.log, for example, and then a new  output.log file is created daily. The    configures how big the output.log file should be before a new file is written. The  configured size in the previous example is 10 MB. And if a log file grows bigger than  10 MB before the end of the day, the file is renamed to output_2018-07-22.1.log, an  index is added to the name, and a new output.log is created. The   sets the  lifespan of a log file, and in our case, it is 30 days.  343   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Logging is a powerful tool; make sure not to abuse it because it can lead to   performance problems and a lot of data that is difficult to analyze for useful information.  Another thing worth noticing is in the previous code. StringBuilder instances are  used to construct big log messages, which are printed at a certain level. What happens  if logging for that level is disabled via configuration? If you guessed that time and  memory are consumed by creating those messages, even if they are not logged, you are  right. So, what do we do? The creators of SLF4J have thought of this as well and added  methods to test if a certain logging level is enabled and those methods can be used in  an if statement that wrap around the performance sensitive code. This being said the  SortingSlf4jDemo.main ..  method becomes  public static void main String... args  {         if  args.length == 0  {             log.error "No data to sort!" ;             return;         }         int[] arr = getInts args ;          if  log.isDebugEnabled    {             final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder                     "Sorting  an array with merge sort: " ;             Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb.append i .append " "  ;             log.debug sb.toString   ;         }          IntSorter mergeSort = new MergeSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length - 1 ;          if  log.isInfoEnabled    {             final StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder "Sorted: " ;             Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb2.append i .append " "  ;             log.info sb2.toString   ;         }     }  In this code sample, if the SLF4J configuration for the com.apress.bgn.ch9 package  is set to info, the message starting with Sorting an array with merge sort: ... is no longer  created nor printed, because the log.isDebugEnabled   returns false, so the code   344   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  enclosed in the if statement is no longer executed. The Logger class contains   if..Enabled   for any logger level.  And this is all that can be said in this section about logging. Remember to use it   moderately, pay very much attention when you decide to log messages in loops and for  big application always use a logging facade, meaning SLF4J.   Debug Using Assertions Another tool to debug your code is using assertions. If you remember the section about  Java keywords, you probably remember the assert keyword. The assert keyword writes  an assertion statement that is a test of your assumptions on the program execution.  In the previous examples, we had the user provide the input for our sorting program,  so for our program to do the right thing, it is assumed that the user provide the proper  input, this means, an array with size bigger than 1, because there is no point to run the  algorithm for a single number. So, how does this assertion looks like in the code? The  answer to this question is in the following code sample.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.IntSorter; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs.QuickSort;  import java.util.Arrays;  import static com.apress.bgn.ch9.SortingSlf4jDemo.getInts;  public class AssertionDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         int[] arr = getInts args ;          assert arr.length > 1;          IntSorter mergeSort = new QuickSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length - 1 ;          final StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder "Sorted: " ;         Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb2.append i .append " "  ;         System.out.println sb2.toString   ;     } }  345   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  If you run this code without providing any arguments to the program, nothing  happens, even if we have an assertion statement in it. The reason for this is that  assertions need to be enabled using a VM argument: -ea. To specify this argument, you  can add it to the command when executing from the command line; but since we’ve  used the editor until now, you can add it in the VM options text box of the IntelliJ IDEA  launcher, as depicted in Figure 9-5.  Figure 9-5.  IntelliJ IDEA launcher for the AssertionDemo class with the -ea VM  argument set  When assertions are enabled, running the previous code ends with an java.lang.  AssertionError being thrown, because the expression of the assertions is evaluated  to false because the arr.length is clearly not bigger than 1 when no argument is  provided. Assertions have two forms. In the simple form, they only have the expression  to evaluate; the assumption to test  assertion expression;  346   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  In this case, java.lang.AssertionError is being thrown. It prints the line of the  assumption being made, which is clearly the wrong assumption for the current run of  the program, with the module and the full classname.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError     at chapter.nine.slf4j com.apress.bgn.ch9.AssertionDemo.main    AssertionDemo.java:48   The complex version of the assertion adds another expression to be evaluated, or a   value in the stack to tell the user that the assumption was wrong.  assertion expression1 : expression 2;  So, if we replace  assert arr.length > 1;  with  assert arr.length > 1 : "Not enough data to sort!";  when java.lang.AssertionError is thrown, it depicts the Not enough data to sort!  message, which makes it clear why the assertion statement is preventing the rest of the  code from being executed.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: Not enough data to sort!      at chapter.nine.slf4j com.apress.bgn.ch9.AssertionDemo.main    AssertionDemo.java:48   Or we could just print the size of the array.  assert arr.length > 1 : arr.length;  Or both.  assert arr.length > 1 :    "Not enough data to sort! Number of values: " + arr.length;  Assertions can be used before and after the piece of code that needs to be debugged.   In the this case, the assertion was used as a precondition of the execution, because the  failure of the assertion prevents code from being executed. But assertions can be used as  post-conditions also to test the outcome of executing a piece of code.  347   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  In the previous code snippet, the assertion was used to test the correctness of the   user provided input. In situations like this, the restriction of a valid input should be  obeyed, whether assertions are enabled or not. Sure, if our array is empty or contains  a single element, this is not a problem, as the algorithm is not executed, and this does  not lead to a technical failure. There are a few rules to obey, or things to look for when  writing code using assertions.     Assertions should not be used to check the correctness   of arguments provided to public methods. Correctness of  arguments should be something tested in the code and a proper  RuntimeException should be thrown and should not be avoidable.     Assertions should not be used to do work that is required for   your application to run properly. The main reason for this is that  assertions are disabled by default and having them disabled leads  to that code not being executed, so the rest of the application does  not function properly because of the missing code.     For performance reasons, do not use expressions that are   expensive to evaluate in assertions. This rule requires no  explanation, even if assertions are disabled by default, imagine that  somebody enables them by mistake on a production application.  That would be unfortunate, wouldn’t it?  If you are interested in using assertions, keep in mind those three rules, and you   should be fine.   Step-by-Step Debugging If you do not want to write log messages, or use assertions, but you still want to inspect  values of variables during the execution of a program. There is a way to do that using  an IDE: pausing the execution using breakpoints and using the IDE to inspect variable  contents or execute simple methods to check if your program is performing as expected.  A breakpoint is a mark set on an executable line of code  not a comment line, not an  empty line and not a declaration . In IntelliJ IDEA, to set a breakpoint, you have to click  the gutter area on the line you are interested in. Or select the line and from the Run menu  select Toggle Line Breakpoint. When a breakpoint is in place, a red bubble appears on the  line in the gutter section. Figure 9-6 shows a few breakpoints in IntelliJ IDEA.  348   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-6.  IntelliJ IDEA breakpoints  Once the breakpoints are in place, when the application is executed in debug mode,   it pauses on each of the lines. You can decide if you want to continue the step-by-step  execution and inspect the values of the variables. IntelliJ IDEA is very helpful with  this because it shows you the contents of every variable in each line of the code being  executed. In Figure 9-7, the SortingSlf4jDemo class is running in debug mode and is  paused during execution using breakpoints.  349   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-7.  IntelliJ IDEA SortingSlf4jDemo class paused during execution  To run an application in debug mode, instead of starting the launcher normally, you  can start it by clicking the green bug-shaped button  marked 1 in Figure 9-7  that is right  next to the green triangle-shaped button that is normally used to run the application.  The application runs and stops at the first line marked with a breakpoint. From that  point on the developer can do the following things.      Inspect values of the variables used on the line with the breakpoint  by reading the values depicted by the editor there.     Continue the execution until the next breakpoint by clicking the   green triangle in the Debug section, marked 2 in Figure 9-7.     Stop the execution by clicking the red square-shaped button in the   Debug section, marked 2 in Figure 9-7.     Disable all breakpoints by clicking red bubble cut diagonally shaped   button in the Debug section, marked 2 in Figure 9-7.     Continue execution to the next line of code by clicking the button with   a 90-degree angle in the Debugger section, marked 3 in Figure 9-7.  350   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting     Continue execution by entering the method in the current line of   code by clicking the button with a blue arrow oriented down, in the  Debugger section, marked 3 in Figure 9-7.     Continue execution by stepping out of the current method by clicking   the button with a blue arrow oriented up, in the Debugger section,  marked 3 in Figure 9-7.     Continue the execution to the line pointed at by the cursor by clicking   the button with a diagonal arrow pointing to a cursor sign in the  Debugger section, marked 3 in Figure 9-7.     Evaluate your own expressions by adding them to the Watches   section marked 4 in Figure 9-7. The only condition is that the  expressions only use variables that are accessible in the context of the  breakpoint line.  Most Java smart editors provide the means to run a Java application in debug mode;  just make sure that you don’t forget to clean up your Watches section from time to time,  because if you add expressions that are expensive to evaluate there, it might affect the  performance of the application. Also, be aware that expressions that use streams might  make the application fail, as proven in Chapter 8.   Inspect Running Application Using Java Tools Aside from the executables to compile Java code and execute or packaging of Java  bytecode, the JDK provides a set of utility executables that can be used to debug and  inspect the state of a running Java application. This section covers the most useful of  them. without further ado, let’s cover the most important ones.   jps  A Java application is assigned a process ID when it is running. This is how an operating  system keeps track of all applications running in parallel at the same. You can see the  process IDs in utilities, such as Process Explorer in Windows and Activity Monitor in  macOS. But if you are comfortable with working in the console, you might prefer using  the jps executable provided by the JDK because it only focuses on Java processes.  When calling jps from the console, all Java process IDs are listed with the main class   351   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  name or some details that are exposed by the application API that help you identify the  application running. This is useful when an application crashes, but the process remains  in a hanging state. This can be painful when the application uses resources such as files  or network ports, because it might block them and prevent you from using them. When  executing jps on my computer  I have a Mac  these are the Java processes I see running.  $ jps 21234 Launcher 18562 21235 SortingSlf4jDemo 3155 muCommander 21236 Jps  As you can see in the listing, jps does include itself in the output, because it is a Java   process. The process with 21235 is the execution of the SortingSlf4jDemo class. The  21234 process is a launcher application that IntelliJ IDEA uses to start the execution  of the SortingSlf4jDemo class. The process with ID 3155 is a Java application that is  an alternative to Total Commander  a Windows file manager application . The 18562  process does not have any description, but at this point I can identify the process myself,  because I know I have IntelliJ IDEA opened, which is itself a Java application.  The advantage of knowing the process IDs is that you can kill them when they   hang and block resources. Let’s assume that the process started by the execution of  SortingSlf4jDemo ended up hanging. To kill a process, all operating systems provide  a version of the kill command. For macOS and Linux, you should execute kill -9  [process_id]. For the preceding example, if I call kill -9 21235 and then call jps, I  can see that that SortingSlf4jDemo process is no longer listed.  $ jps 21234 Launcher 18562 3155 muCommander 21257 Jps  352  I do still have the Launcher process, but that is a child process of IntelliJ IDEA so   there is no point in killing it, because next time I run a main ..  in the IDE, the process is  started again.  jps is a simple tool for this specific purpose, but sometimes when applications are   installed on servers with minimal setup, it might be all you have. So, it’s good to know it exists.   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting   jcmd  The jcmd is another JDK utility that can be useful. It sends diagnostic command requests  to the JVM, which can help troubleshoot and diagnose JVM and running Java applications.  It must be used on the same machine where the JVM is running and the result of calling  it without any commands is that it shows all Java processes currently running on the  machine; it displays the process Ids and the command used to start their execution.  $ jcmd 3155 com.mucommander.muCommander 21369 jdk.jcmd sun.tools.jcmd.JCmd 21355 org.jetbrains.jps.cmdline.Launcher  Applications IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2 EAP .app Contents lib platform-api.jar: Applications IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2 EAP .app Contents lib jps-builders-6.jar: Applications IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2 EAP ... .app Contents lib netty-transport-4.1.25.Final.jar: Applications IntelliJ IDEA  21356 chapter.nine.slf4j com.apress.bgn.ch9.SortingSlf4jDemo 5 a 3 2 b 1 ds 4 21326 org.jetbrains.idea.maven.server.RemoteMavenServer  The simplest command that you can run jcmd with is help on a running process, which  depicts all additional commands you can use on that process. This works if the application  is currently running and not paused using a breakpoint. Since the SortingSlf4jDemo was  paused when I was writing this, I used the muCommander process as an example.  If I call jcmd 3155 help this is what I see:  $ jcmd 3155 help 3155: The following commands are available: JFR.configure JFR.stop JFR.start JFR.dump JFR.check VM.log VM.native_memory VM.check_commercial_features VM.unlock_commercial_features ManagementAgent.status  353   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  ManagementAgent.stop ManagementAgent.start_local ManagementAgent.start Compiler.directives_clear Compiler.directives_remove Compiler.directives_add Compiler.directives_print VM.print_touched_methods Compiler.codecache Compiler.codelist Compiler.queue VM.classloader_stats Thread.print JVMTI.data_dump JVMTI.agent_load VM.stringtable VM.symboltable VM.class_hierarchy VM.systemdictionary GC.class_stats GC.class_histogram GC.heap_dump GC.finalizer_info GC.heap_info GC.run_finalization  GC.run VM.info VM.uptime VM.dynlibs VM.set_flag VM.flags VM.system_properties VM.command_line VM.version help  354   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  It is not the objective of this book to cover them all, as these are advanced features of  Java, but probably you have a basic idea of the scope of each command. As example, the  following shows the output of calling jcmd 3155 GC.heap_info.  $ jcmd 3155 GC.heap_info 3155:   garbage-first heap   total 48128K, used 11698K [0x00000006c0000000,  0x00000007c0000000    region size 1024K, 1 young  1024K , 0 survivors  0K   Metaspace     used 35414K, capacity 35923K, committed 36864K, reserved 1081344K   class space  used 4588K, capacity 4835K, committed 5120K, reserved 1048576K  If you remember, in Chapter 5 the different types of memory used by the JVM were  discussed, and heap was the memory where all the objects used by an application were  stored. This command prints the heap details: the amount that was used and reserved,  the size of a region, and so forth. These details are covered more in detail in Chapter 13.   jconsole  jconsole is JDK utility that can be used to inspect various JVM statistics. To use it, you  have to start it from the command line and connect it to a Java application that is already  running. This application is quite useful, as it can connect to applications running on  different machines also, as long as they are running in debug mode on a server and  expose a port to connect to. To start a Java application in debug mode and expose a  port for an external application, you have to start the application with the following VM  parameters.  -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=1044  The port can be any port really as long as it is bigger than 1024, because those are   restricted by the operating system. The transport=dt_socket instructs the JVM that the  debugger connections is made through a socket, the address=1044 parameter informs  it that the port number is 1044. The suspend=y instructs the JVM to suspend execution  until a debugger is connected to it. To avoid that suspend=n should be used.  For our simple example and considering we use jconsole to debug a Java application   on the same machine, we do not need all that. We need to start jconsole from the  command line and look in the Local Processes: section and identify the Java process we  are interested in debugging. Figure 9-8 shows the first JConsole dialog window.  355   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-8.  JConsole first dialog window  When the process is running locally it can be easily identified because it is named  using the module and the fully qualified main class name. When we use jconsole to  debug locally, the application does not have to run in debug mode, but for an application  as simple as ours we need to make a few tweaks to make sure that we can see a few  statistics with jconsole, during the run of the application. A few Thread.sleep ..   statements were added to pause the execution enough for jconsole to connect. Also,  we’ll use a large array of data to make sure that the statistics are relevant.  public class SortingSlf4jDemo {      private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger SortingSlf4jDemo.class ;       public static void main String... args  throws Exception {        Thread.sleep 3000 ;  356   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting          Random random = new Random 5 ;         IntStream intStream = random.ints 100_000_000,0,350 ;          int[] arr =  intStream.toArray  ;          if  log.isDebugEnabled    {             final StringBuilder sb =                  new StringBuilder "Sorting  an array with merge sort: " ;             Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb.append i .append " "  ;             log.debug sb.toString   ;         }          Thread.sleep 3000 ;          IntSorter mergeSort = new MergeSort  ;         mergeSort.sort arr, 0, arr.length - 1 ;          if  log.isInfoEnabled    {             final StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder "Sorted: " ;             Arrays.stream arr .forEach i -> sb2.append i .append " "  ;             log.info sb2.toString   ;         }     }     ...  }  After doing the modifications, we’ll start the application normally and connect   jconsole to it. After a successful connection, a window like the one shown in Figure 9-9  is opens, and graphs of the JVM memory consumption, number of threads, of classes  loaded and CPU usage are displayed.  357   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-9.  JConsole statistics window  There is a tab for each of these statistics that provides more information, and in  a more complex application, this information can be used to improve performance,  identify potential problems, or even estimate application behavior for desired cases. For  our small application, the jconsole graphs do not reveal much, but if you really want to  see valuable statistics, install an application like mucommander5 use it for a while without  closing it and then connect jconsole to it and have fun.  5 The official MuCommander site is at http:  www.mucommander.com  358   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting   jmc  JMC is short for Oracle Java Mission Control. The jmc command starts an advanced  Oracle application for debugging and analyzing JVM statistics for a running application.  From its official description: JMC is a tool suite for managing, monitoring, profiling, and  troubleshooting your Java applications that became part of the JDK utility tools family  starting with version 7.  Similar to other tools, this utility identifies the Java processes currently running  and provides the possibility to check out how much memory they require at specific  times during execution, how many threads are running in parallel at a given moment  in time, the classes loaded by the JVM, and how much processing power is required to  run a Java application. The JMC has a friendlier interface and one of its most important  components is the Java Flight Recorder that can be used to record all JVM activity while  the application is running, all that data collected during this time being is then used to  diagnose and profile the application.  To inspect the application while it is running, we open the JMC by running jmc from  the command line, and then select the process that we recognize as the one running the  SortingSlf4jDemo main class based on the same rule as before. We look for a process  name containing the module name and the fully classified class name when we found it.  We right-click it and select Start JMX console. You should see something similar to the  image depicted in Figure 9-10.  359   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-10.  JMX console  As you probably noticed, the interface is definitely friendlier and the provided   statistics are more detailed. Using JMC, everything that happens with the application  and JVM during a run can be recorded and analyzed later, even if the application has  stopped running since. The Memory tab provides a lot of information regarding the  memory used by the application, including what types of objects are occupying it. The  information for the memory occupied by SortingSlf4jDemo during its run is depicted in  Figure 9-11.  360   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-11.  JMX console ➤ the Memory tab  To record this information during the application run, or for a limited period of   time, in the JVM Browser expand the process node and select Start Flight Recording.  A window is opened asking you to select a path where the recording is saved and the  duration of the recording. The file has a .jfr extension and can be opened with the  JMC for inspection. The flight recorder menu and the dialog to start recording data are  depicted in Figure 9-12.  361   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-12.  JMC Flight Recording menu and dialog window  The JMC subject is too advanced and broad for this section, an entire book  could probably be written about its usage and how to interpret the statistics. So,  I’ll stop here and recommend this Oracle article if you want to dig deeper: www. oracle.com technetwork java javaseproducts mission-control java-mission-  control-1998576.html.   Accessing the Java Process API Java 9 came with a lot of other improvements aside the Jigsaw modules, one of them  being a new and improved Process API. The Java Process API allows you to start, retrieve  information, and manage native operating system processes. The ability to manipulate  processes was in former versions of Java, but it was rudimentary. Note how a process was  created before Java 5.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  362   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.InputStream; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.io.Reader; import java.nio.charset.Charset; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;  public class ProcessCreationDemo {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger ProcessCreationDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         try {             Process exec = Runtime.getRuntime                  .exec new String[] { " bin sh", "-c", "echo Java   home:  $JAVA_HOME" } ;              exec.waitFor  ;              InputStream is = exec.getInputStream  ;             StringBuilder textBuilder = new StringBuilder  ;             try  Reader reader = new BufferedReader new InputStreamReader                      is, Charset.forName StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name       {                 int c = 0;                 while   c = reader.read    != -1  {                     textBuilder.append  char  c ;                 }             }             log.info "Process output -> {}", textBuilder.toString   ;             log.info "process result: {}", exec.exitValue   ;             } catch  Exception e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } }  Intercepting the output of a process that has started is a pain. We need to wrap a  BufferedReader instance around the InputStream instance connected to the normal  output of the process.  363   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  The process API made things a little more practical. It has at its core a few classes  and interfaces, all with names that start with the "Process" term. What we’ve done so  far with Java executables, can be directly done by writing Java code. The interface that  provides an API to access native processes is named ProcessHandle and is part of the  core Java package java.lang. In a similar manner to the Thread class, there is a static  method named current to call on this interface to retrieve the ProcessHandle instance  of the current running process. Once we have this, we can use its methods to access  more process information. The ProcessHandle provides several static utility methods  to access native processes. Java code can be written to list all processes running on a  computer and they can be sorted based on certain criteria. The following piece of code  lists all the processes that were created by running the java command.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.Optional; public class ProcessListingDemo {      private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger ProcessDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         Optional  currUser = ProcessHandle.current  .info  .user  ;          ProcessHandle.allProcesses              .filter ph -> ph.info  .user  .equals currUser                 && ph.info  .commandLine  .get  .contains "java"              .forEach p ->  log.info "PID: " + p.pid   ;                p.info   .arguments                .ifPresent s -> Arrays.stream s                  .forEach a -> log.info "\t {}", a   ;              p.info  .command                 .ifPresent c -> log.info "\t Command: {}", c  ;         } ;    } }  364   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  This code extracts the user from the current running process by obtaining its   handle and calling info   to obtain an instance of ProcessHandle.Info, an interface  that provides a set of methods to access snapshot information about the process as  the command and arguments that were used to create the process. The output of the  previous code is printed in the console. It should look similar to the following listing.

Also,  some arguments were shortened, as it is useless to waste pages of the book with logs.  Nevertheless, some depiction of the log format was necessary in case you never run the  code yourself.  The previous code sample showed you roughly how to access native processes and  print information about them. But, using the improved Java process API, new processes  can be created, and commands of the underlying operation system can be started. For  example, we can create a process that prints the value of the JAVA_HOME environment  variable, and capture the output to display it in the IntelliJ console.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  public class ProcessCreationDemo {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger ProcessCreationDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         try {             ProcessBuilder pb = new               ProcessBuilder " bin sh", "-c", "echo Java home:  $JAVA_HOME"                  .inheritIO  ;             Process p = pb.start  ;             p.onExit  ;             CompletableFuture  future =  p.onExit  ;             int result = future.get  .exitValue  ;             log.info "Process result: {}", result ;         } catch  Exception e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } }  366   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  New processes can be created by using instances of ProcessBuilder that can receive  as arguments a list of commands and values to use as arguments for them. The class has  many constructors and methods with different signatures that can be used to create and  start processes easily. The inheritIO   method sets the source and destination for the  subprocess standard I O to be the same as the current process. The onExit   method  returns an CompletableFuture  that can be used to access the process at the  end of its execution to retrieve the exit value of the process. For a process terminating  normally, the value should be 0 zero .  When a Java program creates a process, it becomes a child of the process that created   it. To list all child processes, we need to make sure that they last a while, because once  terminated, they obviously no longer exist. The following code sample creates three  identical processes, each of them executing three Linux shell commands: the first is  echo "start" to notify that the process has started execution, the second is sleep 3  that pauses the process for 3 seconds, and the last one  echo "done."  is executed right  before the process finishes its execution. Once the process has started, it can no longer  be controlled, so to make sure that the child processes finish their execution, we’ll ask  the user to press a key to decide when the current process finishes execution by calling  System.in.read  ;.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  public class ProcessCreationDemo {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger ProcessCreationDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         try {             List  builders = List.of                      new ProcessBuilder " bin sh", "-c",                        " echo \"start...\" ; sleep 3; echo \"done.\"" .                      new ProcessBuilder " bin sh", "-c",                        " echo \"start...\" ; sleep 3; echo \"done.\"" .  inheritIO  ,  inheritIO  ,  367   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting                      new ProcessBuilder " bin sh", "-c",                       " echo \"start...\" ; sleep 3; echo \"done.\"" .  inheritIO                 ;             builders.parallelStream  .forEach pbs -> {                 try {                     pbs.start  ;                 } catch  Exception e  {                     log.error "Oops, could not start process!", e ;                 }             } ;              ProcessHandle ph = ProcessHandle.current  ;             ph.children  .forEach pc -> {                 log.info "Child PID: {}", pc.pid   ;                 pc.parent  .ifPresent parent ->                    log.info " Parent PID: {}", parent.pid    ;              } ;             System.out.println "Press any key to exit!" ;             System.in.read  ;         } catch  Exception e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } }  We have grouped the ProcessBuilders in a list and processed the instances using  a parallel stream to make sure that all processes were started almost at the same time.  We printed the results of each of them after termination to make sure all were executed  correctly.  The children   method returns a stream containing ProcessHandle instances   corresponding to the processes started by the current Java process.  The parent   method was called for each child ProcessHandle instance to obtain   the ProcessHandle corresponding to the process that created it.  368   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  When running the previous code, in the console you should see an output similar to   what is depicted in the next listing.  start... start... start... 22:29:04.593 [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch9.ProcessCreationDemo - Child  PID: 3966 22:29:04.594 [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch9.ProcessCreationDemo -   Parent  PID: 3962 22:29:04.594 [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch9.ProcessCreationDemo - Child  PID: 3965 22:29:04.594 [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch9.ProcessCreationDemo -   Parent  PID: 3962 22:29:04.594 [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch9.ProcessCreationDemo - Child  PID: 3964 22:29:04.594 [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch9.ProcessCreationDemo -   Parent  PID: 3962 Press any key to exit! done. done. done.  The improved Java Process API provides a lot more control over running and   spawned processes and in a practical manner. In the past, developers who needed to  work with processes on a more advanced level resorted to native code. A full list of the  Java process API improvements added in Java 9 can be found at https:  docs.oracle. com javase 9 core process-api1.htmJSCOR-GUID-6FAB2491-FD4E-42B4-A883- DCD181A1CE3E.   Testing Debugging is a part of a software process called testing and involves identifying  and correcting code errors. But avoiding technical errors is not enough, testing an  application means much more than that. There is an organization providing very good  materials for training and certifications for software testers. The International Software   369   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Testing Qualifications Board  ISTQB  is a software testing qualification certification  organization that operates internationally. It established a syllabus and a hierarchy of  qualifications and guidelines for software testing.6 If you think you are more interested in  software testing then you should look into getting an ISTQB certification.  The ISTQB defines testing as “the process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both  static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of software  and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements to  demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects.”  This is a technical and academic definition. The definition that I propose is “the   process of verifying that an implementation does what it is supposed to in the amount of  time it is expected to, with an acceptable resources consumption and it does not break  anything while doing so.”   A Small Introduction to Testing I want to be a developer. Why do I need to know all of these details about testing? The  simple answer is because testing is a constant activity that is performed during every  phase of the lifecycle of a software application. When the design is made, simulations  are done and experienced people review the design to decide if it represents a proper  solution for the problem and if it is realizable. When the code is written, it has to be  tested to make sure the application does not crash and behaves as expected. Before  delivery, there is a phase named acceptance testing when client representatives test  the application in a controlled environment so every action is logged and problems  identified. Testing can be done using debugging, using all the methods presented until  now, but the disadvantage of debugging is that it is manual and repetitive. So, let’s  introduce a way to test the application that is a little bit more automated.  !  testing is an essential part of the development process and should start as  early as possible, because the effort of fixing a defect grows exponentially with the  time it takes to be discovered.7  6 The ISTQB certification path: https:  www.istqb.org certification-path-root.html 7 Clean Code by Robert Martin  Prentice Hall, 2008   370   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  During the development phase, aside from writing the actual solution, you can also   write code to test your solution. Those tests can run manually or by a build tool when  you build your project. When writing your code, aside from thinking about the solution  to solve the problem, you should also think about how to test the solution. This approach  is called TDD, which is the acronym for test-driven development, a programming  paradigm that states that you should think about how to test your solution, before  implementing it, because if it is difficult to test, it probably is difficult to implement,  maintain on the long run and extend to solve related problems.  The simplest tests are called unit tests, which test small units of functionality. If unit  tests cannot be written easily, your design might be rotten. Unit tests are the first line of  defense against failures. If unit tests fail, the foundation of your solution is bad.  The tests that span across multiple components, testing the communication between   units of functionality and the results of their interactions against an expected results are  called integration tests.  The last type of tests a developer should write are regression tests, which are tests   that are run periodically to make sure that code that was previously tested still performs  correctly after it is changed. These type of tests are crucial for big projects where code  is written by a considerable number of developers, because sometimes dependencies  among components are not obvious, and code one developer wrote might break another  developer’s code.  This section only shows you how to write unit tests using a Java library called JUnit. It  describes a few typical testing components that a developer can build to set up a context  for the unit tests. Thus, as my Scottish colleagues say, let’s get cracking!   Test Code Location As you probably remember, in Chapter 3 the java-for-absolute-beginners project  structure was explained. The discussion about tests must start with the structure of the  lowest level modules of the project, the ones that contain the source code and tests.  Figure 9-13 shows the structure of the module containing the sources and test code for  the module used in this section.  371   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-13.  The Gradle module structure  The structure shown in Figure 9-13 can be explained as follows.     The src directory contains all code and resources of the project. The   contents are split into two directories main and test.   – The main directory contains the source code and the application configura-  tion files, split into two directories. The java directory contains the Java  source code and the resources contains configuration files, non-executable  text files that can be written according to various formats: XML, SQL, CSV,  etc. , media files, PDFs, and so forth. When the application is built and packed  into a jar  or war or ear  only the files in the java directory are taken onto  account, the *.class filed together with the configuration files are packed.   – The test directory contains code used to test the source code in the src direc-  tory. The Java files are kept under the java directory and in the resources  directory contains configuration files needed to build a test context. The con- tents of the test directory are not part of the project that is delivered to a client.  They exist to help test the application during development.   Application to Test For the examples in this section we build a simple application that uses an embedded  Derby8 database to store data. This is the production database. For the test environment  the database is replaced with various pseudo-constructions that mimic the database   8 If you are interested in finding our more about the Derby database, this is the official resource to  go to: https:  db.apache.org  derby   372   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  behavior. The application is rudimentary. An AccountService implementation takes  data from the input and uses it to manage Account instances. The Account class is a very  abstract an unrealistic implementation of a banking account. It has a holder field, which  is the account owner, an accountNumber field, and an amount field. The AccountService  implementation uses an AccountRepo implementation to perform all related database  operations with Account instances using an implementation of DBConnection. The  classes and interfaces that are making up this simple application and relationships  between them are depicted in Figure 9-14.  Figure 9-14.  Simple Account management application components  The implementation of these classes is not relevant for this section, but if you are   curious, you can find the full code on this book’s official repository. So, let’s start testing.  The easiest way would be to write a main class and perform some account operations.  But, we do not want that, once the application is in production we can no longer test new  features on it, because there are risks of data corruption. Also, production databases are  usually hosted on costly products, such as Oracle RDBMS  Oracle Relational Database  Management System  or Microsoft SQL Server. They are not really appropriate for  development, or testing. Also, the intention is to run tests automatically, so in-memory  or implementations that can be instantiated are more suitable. So, let’s start by testing  our AccountRepoImpl.  373   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting   Introducing JUnit  JUnit is undoubtedly the most used testing framework in the Java development world.  At the end of 2017, JUnit 59 was released that is the next generation of this framework.  It comes with a new engine, is compatible with Java 9+, and comes with a lot of  lambda-based functionalities. JUnit provides annotations to mark test methods for  automated execution, annotations for initialization and destruction of a test context  and utility methods to practically implement test methods. There are multiple JUnit  annotations that you can use. Five of them  and a utility class  represent the core of  the JUnit framework, which is the best place to learn testing. Below each of them are  a short description that builds a general picture of how JUnit can be used to test your  application.              @BeforeAll from package org.junit.jupiter.api is used on a non-  private static method that returns void used to initialize objects  and variables to be used by all test methods in the current class. This  method is called only once, before all test methods in the class, so  test methods should not modify these objects, because their state is  shared and it might affect the test results. Eventually, the static fields  to be initialized by the annotated method, can be declared final,  so once initialized, they can no longer be changed. More than one  method annotated with @BeforeAll can be declared in a test class,  but what would be the point?  @AfterAll from package org.junit.jupiter.api is the counterpart  of @BeforeAll. It is also used to annotate non-private static  methods that return void, but their purpose is to destroy the context  the test methods were run in and perform cleanup actions.  @BeforeEach from package org.junit.jupiter.api is used on  non-private non-static methods that return void and as its  name says, methods annotated with it are executed before every  method annotated with @Test. These methods can be used to further  customize the test context to populate objects with values that tests  assertions in the test methods.  9 Official JUnit 5 site: https:  junit.org junit5   374   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting          @AfterEach from package org.junit.jupiter.api is used on  public non-static methods that return void and as its name  says, methods annotated with it are executed after every method  annotated with @Test.  @Test from package org.junit.jupiter.api is used on non-private  non-static methods that return void and as its name says, the  method annotated with it is a test method. A test class can have one  or more, depending on the class that is being tested.     Utility class org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions provides a set of   methods that support asserting conditions in tests.  Another annotation that you might be interested to know it exists is @DisplayName.   It is declared in the same package as all the others and receives a text argument that  represents the test display name, which is displayed by the editor and in the resulting  reports created by the build tool. Let’s write a pseudo test class so you can get an idea of  how test classes look.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.pseudo;  import org.junit.jupiter.api.*; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertFalse; import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;  public class PseudoTest {      private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger PseudoTest.class ;      @BeforeAll     public static void loadCtx   {         log.info "Loading general test context." ;     }      @BeforeEach     public  void setUp  {         log.info "Prepare  single test context." ;     }  375   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting      @Test     @DisplayName "test one"      public void testOne   {         log.info "Executing test one." ;         assertTrue true ;     }      @Test     @DisplayName "test two"      public void testTwo   {         log.info "Executing test two." ;         assertFalse false ;     }      @AfterEach     public void tearDown  {         log.info "Destroy  single test context." ;     }      @AfterAll     public static void unloadCtx  {         log.info "UnLoading general test context." ;     } }  Keeping in mind the information that you now have about these annotations, when  running this class, we expect the log messages that each method prints to be in the exact  order that we have defined, because the methods have been strategically placed in the  previous code so the JUnit order of execution is respected. The only thing that cannot  be guaranteed is the order the tests are executed in. Also parallel execution of tests is  possible by adding a file named junit-platform.properties under test\resources  that contains the following properties with values matching the hardware configuration.  junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=8  376   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Most Java smart editors like IntelliJ IDEA provide you with an option to do so when   you right-click the class. Figure 9-15 shows the menu option to execute a test class in  IntelliJ IDEA.  Figure 9-15.  Menu option to execute a test class in IntelliJ IDEA  After right-clicking the class, select Run ‘PseudoTest.java’ from the menu that   appears. The test class is executed. A launcher is created. Test classes can be executed  in debug mode, and breakpoints can be used. When executing the previous class, even  if the test methods are run in parallel, the output is consistent with the order of the  methods matching the annotation specifications. To make sure that test methods are  executed in parallel, the logger was configured to print the thread ID. The following is a  sample output.

The true value is replaced with a condition  in a real test. The same goes for the assertFalse false ; assertion in the textTwo    method.  And that’s about all the space we can dedicate to JUnit in this book. But my honest   recommendation is to look more into it, because a developer can write code, but a good  developer knows how to make sure it works.  Using Fakes  A fake object is an object that has working implementations, but not the same as  the production object. The code written to implement such an object has simplified  functionality of the one deployed in production.  To test the AccountRepoImpl class, we have to replace the DerbyDBConnection with a  FakeDBConnection that is not backed up by a database, but by something simpler, more  accessible like a Map. The DerbyDBConnection uses a java.sql.Connection and other  classes in that package to perform data operations on the Derby database.  The FakeDBConnection implement the DBConnection interface, so it can be passed to   a AccountRepoImpl and all its methods is called on it.  The rule of thumb when writing tests and test supporting classes is to put them in  the same packages with the objects tested or replaced, but in the test java directory.  But because we show you more than one approach of testing, each package is named  accordingly. The package to test the application classes using fakes is named  com. apress.bgn.ch9.fake.  Another rule of thumb when writing tests is to write a method to test the correct   outcome of the method being tested, and one to test the incorrect behavior. In unexpected  cases with unexpected data, your application behaves in unexpected ways, so although  this seems paradoxical, you have to expect the unexpected and write tests for it.  The AccountRepoImpl class implements the basic methods to persist or delete an   Account instance to from the database. The implementation is depicted next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.db.DbConnection;  import java.util.List; import java.util.Optional;  378   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  public class AccountRepoImpl implements AccountRepo {      private DbConnection conn;      public AccountRepoImpl DbConnection conn  {         this.conn = conn;     }      @Override     public Account save Account account  {         Account dbAcc = conn.findByHolder account.getHolder   ;         if dbAcc == null  {             return conn.insert account ;         }         return conn.update account ;     }      @Override     public Optional  findOne String holder  {         Account acc = conn.findByHolder holder ;         if acc != null  {             return Optional.of acc ;         }         return Optional.empty  ;     }      @Override     public List  findAll   {         return conn.findAll  ;     }      @Override     public int deleteByHolder String holder  {         Account acc = conn.findByHolder holder ;         conn.delete holder ;         if acc != null  {             return 0;         }  379   To test this method we need to provide a DbConnection implementation that  simulates a connection to a database. This is where FakeDBConnection comes in.

The map key is the holder’s name, because in  our database the holder name is used as an unique identifier for an Account entry in the  table. Now, that we have the fake object, we can test that our AccountRepoImpl behaves  as expected. Because of practical reasons only one method is tested in this section, but  the full code is available on the official GitHub repo for the book.  The deleteByHolder method in the AccountRepoImpl deletes an account. If the entry  is present, it deletes it and returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1. The deleteByHolder method  is depicted in the next code snippet.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.db.DbConnection;  import java.util.List; import java.util.Optional;  public class AccountRepoImpl implements AccountRepo {      private DbConnection conn;      public AccountRepoImpl DbConnection conn  {         this.conn = conn;     }      @Override     public int deleteByHolder String holder  {         Account acc = conn.findByHolder holder ;         conn.delete holder ;         if acc != null  {             return 0;         }         return 1;     }     ... }  382   The test class is depicted next, and both cases are covered  when there is an entry to   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  delete and when there isn’t .   package com.apress.bgn.ch9.fake;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.db.DbConnection; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.fake.db.FakeDBConnection; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo.AccountRepo; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo.AccountRepoImpl; import org.junit.jupiter.api.*; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals; import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;  public class AccountRepoTest {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger AccountRepoTest.class ;     private static DbConnection conn;      private AccountRepo repo;      @BeforeAll     public static void prepare   {         conn = new FakeDBConnection  ;     }      @BeforeEach     public void setUp  {         repo = new AccountRepoImpl conn ;             inserting an entry so we can test update         repo.save new Account "Pedala", 200, "2345"  ;     }  383   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting      @Test     public void testFindOneExisting   {         Optional  expected = repo.findOne "Pedala" ;         assertTrue expected.isPresent   ;     }      @Test     public void testFindOneNonExisting  {         Optional  expected = repo.findOne "Dorel" ;         assertFalse expected.isPresent   ;     }     @AfterEach     public void tearDown  {            delete the entry         repo.deleteByHolder "Pedala" ;     }      @AfterAll     public static void cleanUp  {         conn = null;         log.info "All done!" ;     } }  Notice how, we are creating exactly one entry that is added to our fake database   before a test method is executed and deleted afterwards.  Now that we are sure the repository class does its job properly the next one to test is  the AccountServiceImpl. To test this class we look into a different approach. Fakes, are  useful but writing one for a class with complex functionality can be cost inefficient in  regards to development time. In the next section, we’ll look at stubs.  Using Stubs  384  A stub is an object that holds predefined data and uses it to answer test calls. An instance  of AccountServiceImpl uses an instance of AccountRepo to retrieve data from the  database or save data to a database. Considering we are writing unit tests, we want to  cover the functionality of the service class, so we can write a stub class to simulate the  behavior of AccountRepo. For the AccountServiceImpl instance to use it the stub must    Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  implement AccountRepo. In this section the tests cover the method createAccount ...   because there are multiple points of failure and we can write a lot of different tests for it.  In the following code snippet the createAccount ...  method is depicted.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.service;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo.AccountRepo;  import java.util.Optional;   **  * @author Iuliana Cosmina  * @since 1.0  *  public class AccountServiceImpl implements AccountService {      AccountRepo repo;      public AccountServiceImpl AccountRepo repo  {         this.repo = repo;     }      @Override     public Account createAccount String holder, String accountNumber,          String amount  {         int intAmount;         try {             intAmount = Integer.parseInt amount ;         } catch  NumberFormatException nfe  {             throw new InvalidDataException                  "Could not create account with invalid amount!" ;         }          if  accountNumber == null                accountNumber.isEmpty    accountNumber.length   < 5                intAmount < 0  {             throw new InvalidDataException                  "Could not create account with invalid account number!" ;         }  385   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting          Optional  existing = repo.findOne holder ;         if  existing.isPresent    {             throw new AccountCreationException                 "Account already exists for holder " + holder ;         }         Account acc = new Account holder, intAmount, accountNumber ;         return repo.save acc ;     }     ... }  The createAccount ..  method takes as parameters the holder name, the number  of the account to be created and the initial amount. All of them are provided as String  instances intentionally, so that the method body contains a little bit of logic that would  require serious testing. Let’s analyze the behavior of the previous method and make a list  with all possible returned values and returned exceptions.                              If the amount is not a number, an InvalidDataException is thrown.  If the accountNumber argument is empty, an InvalidDataException  is thrown.  If the accountNumber argument is null, an InvalidDataException is  thrown.  If the accountNumber argument has less than five characters, an  InvalidDataException is thrown.  If the amount argument converted to a number is negative, an  InvalidDataException is thrown.  If there is an account for the holder argument already an  AccountCreationException is thrown.  If all the inputs are valid and there is no account for the holder  argument, an Account instance is created, saved to the database, and  the result is returned.  386   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  So, if we were to be really obsessive about testing, we would have to write a test  scenario for all of these cases. In the software world, there is something called test  coverage, which is a process that determines whether test cases cover application code  and how much of it. The result is a percentage value and companies usually define a test  coverage percent10 that represents a warranty of quality for the application. So, let’s write  all those tests methods, just for the practice. But before that, let’s see what the repo stub  looks like.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.stub;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo.AccountRepo;  import java.util.List; import java.util.Optional;  public class AccountRepoStub implements AccountRepo {      private  Integer option = 0;     public synchronized void set int val  {         option = val;     }      @Override     public Account save Account account  {         return account;     }      @Override     public Optional  findOne String holder  {         if option == 0  {             return Optional.of new Account holder, 100 ,"22446677"  ;         }         return Optional.empty  ;     }  10 A good read about test coverage, by Martin Fowler, one of the most renown Java gurus of this   generation: https:  martinfowler.com  bliki TestCoverage.html  387   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting      @Override     public List  findAll   {         return List.of new Account "sample", 100, "22446677"  ;     }      @Override     public int deleteByHolder String holder  {         return option;     } }  The option field can be used to change behavior of the stub to cover more test   cases. This is useful when test methods are not executed in parallel. Test execution is  done in parallel when time is of the essence, and if stubs are used, each method should  instantiate and use its own stub to avoid collisions with other methods, which will most  probably lead to test failures.  A negative test, passing for the situation when the input represents an invalid   amount can be written in two way using JUnit. The two approaches only differ in how  lambda expressions are used.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.service;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.service.stub.AccountRepoStub; import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;  import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals; import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;  public class AccountServiceTest {      private static AccountRepoStub repo;     private AccountService service;      @BeforeAll     public static void prepare   {         repo = new AccountRepoStub  ;     }  388   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting      @BeforeEach     public void setUp   {         service = new AccountServiceImpl repo ;     }      @Test     public void testNonNumericAmountVersionOne   {         assertThrows InvalidDataException.class,                    -> {                     service.createAccount "Gigi", "223311", "2I00" ;                 } ;     }      @Test     public void testNonNumericAmountVersionTwo   {         InvalidDataException expected = assertThrows                  InvalidDataException.class,    -> {                     service.createAccount "Gigi", "223311", "2I00" ;                 }          ;         assertEquals "Could not create account with invalid amount!"             , expected.getMessage   ;     }  @AfterEach     public void tearDown   {         repo.set 0 ;     }      @AfterAll     public static void destroy   {         repo = null;     } }  The testNonNumericAmountVersionOne   method makes use of assertThrows that  receives two parameters: the type of exception that is expected for the second parameter  of type Executable to throw when executed. Executable is a functional interface defined  in the org.junit.jupiter.api.function, which can be used in a lambda expression to  get the compact test that you see.  389   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  The testNonNumericAmountVersionTwo   method saves the result of the   assertThrows ..  call, which allows for the message of the exception to be tested and to  make sure that the execution flow worked exactly as expected.

This is left as an   exercise for you. Because there is one more test technique we have to cover in this  chapter: using mocks.   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Using Mocks  Mocks are objects that register calls they receive. During execution of a test, using assert  utility methods, the assumption that all expected actions were performed on mocks are  tested. Thankfully, code for mocks does not have to be written by the developer, there are  three well-known libraries that provide the type of classes needed to test using mocks:  Mockito,11 JMock,12 and EasyMock.13 Also, if you are ever in need to mock static methods,  the most common reason being bad design, there is PowerMock.14  Using mocks, you can jump directly to writing the tests. So, let’s write two tests for  the createAccount ..  method that focus on the repository class calling its methods,  because the repository class is being replaced by a mock.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.mock;  import com.apress.bgn.ch9.Account; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.repo.AccountRepo; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.service.AccountCreationException; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.service.AccountServiceImpl; import com.apress.bgn.ch9.service.InvalidDataException; import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith; import org.mockito.InjectMocks; import org.mockito.Mock; import org.mockito.junit.jupiter.MockitoExtension;  import java.util.Optional;  import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*; import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any; import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;  @ExtendWith MockitoExtension.class  public class AccountServiceTest {  11 Mockito official site: http:  site.mockito.org  12 Official site for JMock: http:  jmock.org  13 Official site for EasyMock: http:  easymock.org  14 Official site for PowerMock: http:  powermock.github.io   393   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting      @InjectMocks     private AccountServiceImpl service;      @Mock     private AccountRepo mockRepo;      @BeforeEach     public void checkMocks   {         assertNotNull service ;         assertNotNull mockRepo ;     }      @Test     public void testCreateAccount   {         Account expected = new Account "Gigi", 2100, "223311" ;         when mockRepo.findOne "Gigi"  .thenReturn Optional.empty   ;         when mockRepo.save any Account.class   .thenReturn expected ;          Account result = service.createAccount "Gigi", "223311", "2100" ;         assertEquals expected, result ;     }      @Test     public void testCreateAccountAlreadyExists   {         Account expected = new Account "Gigi", 2100, "223311" ;         when mockRepo.findOne "Gigi"  .thenReturn Optional.of expected  ;          assertThrows AccountCreationException.class,                    -> {                     service.createAccount "Gigi", "223311", "2100" ;                 } ;     } }  The tests are self-explanatory; the Mockito utility methods names make it easy to   understand what is happening during a test execution. But how the mocks are created and  injected, needs to be explained. So, let’s do that! the @ExtendWith MockitoExtension. class  is necessary for JUnit 5 tests to support Mockito annotations. Without it  annotations like @InjectMocks and @Mock have no effect on the code.  394   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  The @Mock annotation is to be used on references to mocks created by Mockito. The   preferred way to work with mocks is to specify a reference of an interface type that is  implemented by the real object type and the mock that is created for the test scenario.  But @Mock can be placed on a concrete type reference as well, and the created mock is a  subclass of that class.  The @InjectMocks annotation is used on the object to be tested, so that Mockito   knows to create this object and inject mocks instead of the dependencies.  So, this is basically all you need to know to start using Mockito mocks in your test.  Declaring the objects to be mocked and the object to be injected in is the only setup a  class containing unit tests using mocks needs.  The body of test methods using mocks have a typical structure. The first lines must  declare objects and variables passed as arguments to the method called on the object  being tested or passed as arguments to Mockito utility methods that declare what mocks  take as arguments and what they return. The next lines establish the behavior of the mock  when its methods are called by the object to be tested. The following two lines depict this  for the findOne ..  method. The first line creates an account object. The second lines  define the behavior of the mock. When mockRepo.findOne "Gigi"  is called, the previously  created account instance is returned wrapped in an Optional  instance.  Account expected = new Account "Gigi", 2100, "223311" ; when mockRepo.findOne "Gigi"  .thenReturn Optional.of expected  ;  There are many other libraries to make writing tests effortless for developers. Big   frameworks like Spring provide their own testing library to help developers write tests for  applications. Build tools like Ant, Maven, and Gradle can automatically run tests when  the project is built, and generate useful reports related to the failures. Using Gradle,  the project can be built by calling gradle clean build in the console. All test classes  declared in the test module, are picked up automatically if they are named *Test.java.  When writing tests, and not changing application code, you can run the tests only by  calling gradle test. This is a configuration that can be changed by overloading the  Gradle test task; you can look into that if you are curious.  The Gradle reports are in HTML format so they can be opened in the browser, and   they look amazing. The reports are generated as a site with an index.html stat page,  which are located at java-bgn chapter09 testing build reports tests test  index.html.  I’ve chosen to fail a test intentionally so that you can see how that report looks like    see Figure 9-16 .  395   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-16.  The Gradle test reports  396   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  To conclude this section, remember this: no matter how good a development team   is, without a great testing team, the resulting application might actually be far away from  an acceptable quality standard. So, if you ever come across companies that do not have  a dedicated testing team, or at least a company culture that does not compromise in  techniques such as code review and writing tests, think twice before accepting that job.   Documenting In the software world, there is a joke about documentation that might not be to  everybody’s liking, but it is worth a mention.  !  Documentation is like sex: when it’s good, it is really, really good. and when it’s  bad, it’s still better than nothing.  A common-sense rule and best practice of programming is to write code that is self-   explanatory, so you won’t need to write documentation. Basically, if you need to write  too much documentation, you’re doing it wrong. There are a lot of things you can do to  avoid writing documentation, like using meaningful names for classes and variables,  respect the language code conventions and many others. But when you are building a  set of classes that is used by other developers, you need to provide a little documentation  for the main APIs. Of course, if your solution requires a very complicated algorithm to be  written, you might want to add comments here and there; although in this case, proper  technical documentation with schemas and diagrams should be written too.  The Javadoc block comments are associated with a public class, interface, method  body, or public field; sometimes even protected, if necessary. The Javadoc comments  contain special tags that link documented elements together, or mark the different type  of information. The Javadoc comments and their associated code can be processed by  Javadoc tools, extracted, and wrapped into an HTML site that is called the Javadoc API  of the project. The Gradle build tool that is used by this project exposes a task named  javadoc that can be executed to generate the Javadoc API site for a module. To compact  the documentation of a project with multiple modules a special plugin is needed.15 Also,  smart editors can access the documentation and display it when the developer tries to  write code using the documented components.  15 Same goes for Maven and any other Java build tool.  397   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Let’s start with a few examples of Javadoc comments to explain the most important   tags used.  Whenever we create a class or interface, we should add Javadoc comments to   explain their purpose, add the version of the application, and link existing resources.  IntSorter is a hierarchy of classes implementing the IntSorter interface that provides  implementations of different sorting algorithms. If these classes are used by other  developers, one of them might want to add a customized algorithm to our hierarchy and  a little information about the IntSorter interface would go a long way. In the following  code snippet, a Javadoc comment was added to the IntSorter interface.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs;   **  * Interface {@code IntSorter} is an interface that needs to be implemented  * by classes that provide a method to sort an array of {@code int} values.    *  * {@code int[]} was chosen as a type because this type   * of values are always sortable. {@link Comparable}   *  * @author Iuliana Cosmina  * @since 1.0  *  public interface IntSorter {         ... }  In the Javadoc comments, HTML tags can be used to format information. In   the previous code,   elements were used to make sure the comment is made of  multiple paragraphs. The @author tag was introduced in JDK 1.0. It is useful when  the development team is large, because if you end up working with somebody else’s  code, you know who to look for if issues appear. The @since tag provides the version  of the application in which this interface was added. For an application that has had  a long development and release cycle, this tag can be used to mark the elements of a  specific version, so that a developer using the codebase of your application knows when  elements were added; and in a rollback to a former version, knows where compile-time  errors appear in the application.  398   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  The best example here is the Java official Javadoc; let’s take the Optional    interface, which was introduced in version 8. But more methods were added to it in  versions 9, 10, and 11, and each of them are marked with the specific versions.  package java.util;   ...   **  ...  * @param   the type of value  * @since 1.8  *  public final class Optional  { ...       **        ...      * @since 9      *       public void ifPresentOrElse Consumer  action, Runnable   emptyAction  {          if  value != null  {             action.accept value ;         } else {             emptyAction.run  ;         }     }       **      ...      * @since 10      *      public T orElseThrow   {         if  value == null  {             throw new NoSuchElementException "No value present" ;         }         return value;     }  399   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting        **      * If a value is  not present, returns {@code true}, otherwise      * {@code false}.      *      *  @return  {@code true} if a value is not present, otherwise {@code false}      * @since   11      *      public boolean isEmpty   {         return value == null;     }  In the IntSorter example, you see the @code tag that was introduced in Java 1.5.   It displays text in code form, using a special font and escaping symbols that might  break the HTML syntax. ex:   . The @link tag was added in Java 1.2 and inserts a  navigable link to relevant documentation.  Now, let’s document the method declarations to let the developer know what they   should be used for.  package com.apress.bgn.ch9.algs;   **  * Interface {@code IntSorter} is an interface that needs to be implemented  * by classes that provide a method to sort an array of {@code int} values.    *  * {@code int[]} was chosen as a type because this type   * of values are always sortable. {@link Comparable}   *  * @author Iuliana Cosmina  * @since 1.0  *  public interface IntSorter {  .. }  400   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting    **      * Sorts {@code arr}      *      * @param arr int array to be sorted      * @param low lower limit of the interval to be sorted      * @param high higher limit of the interval to be sorted      *       void sort int[] arr, int low, int high ;       **      * This method was used to sort arrays using BubbleSort      * @deprecated As of version 0.1, because the      *             {@link sort int[], int, int    } should be used instead.      * To be removed in version 1.1      * @param arr int array to be sorted      *      @Deprecated  since= "0.1", forRemoval = true      default void sort int[] arr  {         System.out.println "Do not use this! This is deprecated!!" ;     } }  The IntelliJ IDEA editor  and other smart editors  generate small pieces of Javadoc   for you. Once you have declared a class or method body that you want to document, type   **, and press Enter. The generated block of comment contains the following.     one or more @param tags with the parameter names, all is left for   the developer to do is to add extra documentation to explain their  purpose.      if the method returns a value of a type different than void and  @return is added, documentation must be provided by the  developer to explain what the result represents and if there are  special cases when a certain value is returned. And since we started  using Optional  as a study case, here is the Javadoc of the  isPresent ..  method.  401   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting   **  ...      * @param predicate the predicate to apply to a value, if present      * @return an {@code Optional} describing the value of this      *          {@code Optional}, if a value is present and the value   matches the       *         given predicate, otherwise an empty {@code Optional}      * @throws NullPointerException if the predicate is {@code null}      *      public Optional  filter Predicate  predicate  {         Objects.requireNonNull predicate ;         if  !isPresent    {             return this;         } else {             return predicate.test value  ? this : empty  ;         }     }      if the methods declare an exception to be thrown, a @throws tag is  generated together with the exception type, the developer’s job is to  explain when and why that type of exception is thrown.   ** ...      * @param action the action to be performed, if a value is present      *  @throws NullPointerException if value is present and the   given action is       *         {@code null}      *      public void ifPresent Consumer  action  {         if  value != null  {             action.accept value ;         }     }  The @link creates a documentation link to a class page, a method documentation   section, or a field. In the previous sort method declaration example, we created a link to  the other method in the interface. 402   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  The @deprecated tag adds text explaining the reasons for deprecation, the version,  and what to use instead. Javadoc generation tools take this text format it with italic and  add it to the main description of the method.  And with this we have covered the most used tags when writing Javadoc comments.   If you want to check out the complete list, you can find it at https:  docs.oracle. com javase 7 docs technotes tools windows javadoc.htmljavadoctags. Javadoc  documentation is a wide subject that could provide material for an entire book. We are just  scratching the surface in this section and covering the basics so you have a good start.  To generate the HTML site for the logging-jul module, the easiest way to do   it, is to open the Gradle project view, expand the chapter09:logging-jul ➤ Tasks ➤  Documentation node and under it we find the javadoc task, as depicted in Figure 9-17.  To execute the task, we have to double-click it.  Figure 9-17.

The javadoc task identifies the deprecated elements and prints a warning for the   developer to see. After the successful execution of that task, build directory can be  found under the logging-jul directory. That is where all Gradle tasks ran from IntelliJ  IDEA store their results. In this directory there should be a docs ➤ javadoc directory  hierarchy. And if we expand the javadoc hierarchy we should see all the files making up  the Javadoc site of our module. The output to look forward to is depicted in Figure 9-18.  404   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-18.  Javadoc site generated by execution of the Gradle javadoc task  Any site has a starting page and the default one is index.html. Right-click that file,  and from the context sensitive menu that appears, select Open in Browser and select  your preferred browser. If you think the page resembles the JDK official Javadoc page,  you are not imagining it; the same Doclet API was used to generate that official one. For  a detailed view of all the documentation in the module project , click the FRAMES link.  This redirects to a page that on the left; it has two frames: one with the packages of the  project and one with the classes interfaces enums and the frame on the right, which  displays information about every item clicked in frames on the left. You should be seeing  something similar to the page depicted in Figure 9-19.  405   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-19.  Javadoc site generated by execution of the Gradle javadoc task,  opened in the browser  Javadoc documentation is picked up by IntelliJ IDEA and other smart editors, and   depicted on the spot when the developer uses the documented components in the  code. When selecting a class, method name, interface method, and so forth, most smart  editors provide some kind of combination of keys that include F1, which the developer  must press so that the documentation is depicted in a pop-up window. In IntelliJ IDEA,  click an element and press F1, and the Javadoc documentation is shown in a pop-up  window and formatted nicely, as depicted in Figure 9-20.  406   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting  Figure 9-20.  Javadoc information depicted in IntelliJ IDEA  You can view Javadoc information in a smart editor for any dependency of your  project  including JDK classes  as long as the code is open source and the module  exports the appropriate packages.  In Java 9, the Doclet API for generating Javadoc received an upgrade and a facelift.  Before Java 9, developers complained about the performance issues of the old version,  the cryptic API, the lack of support and the shallowness of it over all. In Java 9, most  of the problems were resolved. A detailed description of improvements is at http:   openjdk.java.net jeps 221.  Documentation is really valuable and can make development practical and pleasant   when it is really, really good. So, when writing code, document it as you expect the  dependencies of your project to be.  You might probably have heard of the expression RTFM, which is an abbreviation   for Read The F***ing Manual!. That expression is used a lot in software by experienced  developers when working with newbie developers. Problem is, what should you do when  there is no manual? Most companies on a deadline might have the tendency to allocate  little or no time to documenting a project. So, this section was added to this book to  emphasize the importance of documentation in software development, and teaching  you how to write your documentation while you write your code, because you might not  have time to do it afterwards.  407   Chapter 9    Debugging, testing, anD DoCumenting   Summary This chapter covered important development tools and techniques, the classes in JDK that  provide support for them, and important Java libraries that could make your development  job more practical and pleasant. The following is the complete list of topics.     how to configure and use logging in a Java application     how to log messages in the console     how to log messages to a file     how to use Java logging     what a logging facade is and why it is recommended      configuring and using SLF4J with Logback     how to program using assertions     how to debug using IntelliJ IDEA     how to monitor and inspect JVM statistics while an application is   running using various JDK tools: jps, jcmd, jconsole, and jmc     how to use the Process API     how to test an application using JUnit     how to write tests using fakes     how to write tests using mocks     how to write tests using stubs     how to document a Java application and generate documentation in   HTML format  408   CHAPTER 10  Making Your Application  Interactive  So far in the book input for our Java programs data was provided via arrays or variables  that were initialized inside the code or via program arguments. But most applications  nowadays require interaction with the user. The user can be provided access by entering  a username and a password; the user is sometimes required to enter information to  confirm his her identity or to instruct the application what to do. Java supports multiple  methods for user input to be read. In this chapter a few ways to build interactive Java  applications are covered. Interactive Java application take their input either from the  console, either from Java built interfaces, either desktop or web.  JShell is a command line interface, where a developer can enter variable declarations   and one line statements that are executed when the Enter key is pressed. Command  line interface shells like bash and terminals like Command Prompt from Windows can  issue commands to programs in the form of successive lines of text. JShell was covered  at the beginning of the book for the simple reason that it was a Java 9 novelty. The next  sections cover how to read user-provided data and instructions using the command-line  interface. The sections after that focus on building Java applications with a desktop web  interface.   Reading Data from the Command Line This section is dedicated to reading user input from the command line, whether is the  IntelliJ IDEA console, or if the program is run from an executable jar from any terminal  specific to an operating system. In the JDK, there are two classes that can be used to read  user data from the command line: java.util.Scanner and java.io.Console and this  section cover them both in detail. Without further ado, let’s get into it.    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_10  409    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Chapter 10   Reading User Data Using System.in Before introducing logging in Chapter 9 to print data in the console, methods under  System.out were used. There is also a counterpart utility object named System. in used to read data from the console, data that a user of the program introduces to  control the application flow. You might have noticed that until now all Java programs,  when executed they would be started, they would process the data, would execute the  declared statements and then they would terminate, exit gracefully or with an exception  when something went wrong. The most simple and common way to pass decision of  termination to the user is to end the main method with a call to System.in.read  . This  method reads the next byte of data from the input stream and the program is paused  until the user introduces a value, as the value is returned we can even save it and print it.  import java.io.IOException;  public class ReadingFormStdinDemo {      public static void main String... args  throws IOException {         System.out.print "Press any key to terminate:" ;          int read = System.in.read  ;         System.out.println "Key pressed: " + read ;     }  If you run the class using IntelliJ, you notice that the Press any key to terminate:   message is printed and then the application just hangs. If you click the window where  the message was printed and push any key, the byte value of the pressed key is printed  and then the application terminates. So if you were to execute the previous code and  press Enter, the following is what you see in the console.1  Press any key to terminate: Key pressed: 10  But reading single bytes from the console is not really useful, right? Thankfully, there   is another form of the read ..  method that saves the user entry into a byte array. But  since the size is fixed, no matter how long the user entry , only what fits in the array is   1 ASCII Table and Description https:  www.asciitable.com   410   saved. The final   that ends the entry is returned as an int value equal to 3, which  is the code for end of text. So, the previous code changes to  Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import java.io.IOException;  public class ReadingFormStdinDemo {      public static void main String... args  throws IOException {         System.out.print "Press any key to terminate:" ;          byte[] b = new byte[3];         int read = System.in.read b ;         for  int i = 0; i < b.length; ++i  {             System.out.println b[i] ;         }         System.out.println "Key pressed: " + read ;     } }  And now the user input is saved in the byte[] b array. But, it is not useful to just read   bytes, right? Well, let’s look at how we can read full text and numeric values from the  user: enter the java.util.Scanner class.   Using Scanner The System.in variable is of type java.io.InputStream, which is a JDK special type  extended by all classes representing an input stream of bytes. This means that System.in  can be wrapped in any java.io.Reader extension so bytes can be read as readable data.  But, the one that is really important is a class named Scanner from package java.util.  An instance of this type can be created by calling its constructor and providing System. in as an argument. The Scanner class provides a lot of next..   methods that can be  used to read almost any type from the console. In Figure 10-1, you can see the next..    methods list.  411   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Figure 10-1.  Scanner methods for reading various types of data  The advantage of using Scanner to read data from the console is that the values read  are automatically converted to the proper types, when possible. When it is not possible,  a java.util.InputMismatchException is thrown. The following piece of code was  designed so you can select the type of value you want to read by inserting a text and then  the value. In the code, the appropriate method of the Scanner instance is called to read  the value.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import java.io.IOException; import java.math.BigInteger; import java.util.Scanner;  public class ReadingFormStdinDemo {      public static final String EXIT = "exit";     public static final String HELP = "help";     public static final String BYTE = "byte";     public static final String SHORT = "short";     public static final String INT = "int";  412   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive      public static final String BOOLEAN = "bool";     public static final String DOUBLE = "double";     public static final String LINE = "line";     public static final String BIGINT = "bigint";     public static final String TEXT = "text";      public static void main String... args  throws IOException {         Scanner sc = new Scanner System.in ;         String help = getHelpString  ;         System.out.println help ;          String input;         do {             System.out.print "Enter option: " ;             input = sc.nextLine  ;              switch  input  {    case HELP:        System.out.println help ;        break;    case EXIT:        System.out.println "Hope you had fun. Buh-bye!" ;        break;    case BYTE:        byte b = sc.nextByte  ;        System.out.println "Nice byte there: " + b ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    case SHORT:        short s = sc.nextShort  ;        System.out.println "Nice short there: " + s ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    case INT:        int i = sc.nextInt  ;        System.out.println "Nice int there: " + i ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;  413   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive     case BOOLEAN:        boolean bool = sc.nextBoolean  ;        System.out.println "Nice boolean there: " + bool ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    case DOUBLE:        double d = sc.nextDouble  ;        System.out.println "Nice double there: " + d ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    case LINE:        String line = sc.nextLine  ;        System.out.println "Nice line of text there: " + line ;        break;    case BIGINT:        BigInteger bi = sc.nextBigInteger  ;        System.out.println "Nice big integer there: " + bi ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    case TEXT:        String text = sc.next  ;        System.out.println "Nice text there: " + text ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    default:        System.out.println "No idea what you want bruh!" ;             }          } while  !input.equalsIgnoreCase EXIT  ;     }      private static String getHelpString   {          return new StringBuilder "This application helps you test various   usage of Scanner. Enter type to be read next:"   414   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive     .append "\n\t help >  displays this help"     .append "\n\t exit >  leave the application"     .append "\n\t byte > read a byte"     .append "\n\t short > read a short"     .append "\n\t int > read an int"     .append "\n\t bool > read a boolean"     .append "\n\t double > read a double"     .append "\n\t line > read a line of text"     .append "\n\t bigint > read a BigInteger"     .append "\n\t text > read a text value" .toString  ;     } }  As you probably noticed in the code sample, most scanner methods are called   together with a nextLine  , this is because every input you provide is made of the actual  token and a new line character  the   pressed to end your input , and before you  can enter your next value, you need to take that character from the stream as well.  Let’s test the previous code a little.  This application helps you test various usage of Scanner. Enter type to be  read next:         help >  displays this help         exit >  leave the application         byte > read a byte         short > read a short         int > read an int         bool > read a boolean         double > read a double         line > read a line of text         bigint > read a BigInteger         text > read a text value Enter option: byte 12 Nice byte there: 12 Enter option: bool true  415   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Nice boolean there: true Enter option: line some of us are hardly ever here Nice line of text there: some of us are hardly ever here Enter option: text john Nice text there: john Enter option: text the rest of us are made to disappear... Nice text there: the Enter option: double 4.2 Nice double there: 4.2 Enter option: int AAAA Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException        at java.base java.util.Scanner.throwFor Scanner.java:939         at java.base java.util.Scanner.next Scanner.java:1594         at java.base java.util.Scanner.nextInt Scanner.java:2258         at java.base java.util.Scanner.nextInt Scanner.java:2212         at chapter.ten com.apress.bgn.ch10.ReadingFormStdinDemo.main                ReadingFormStdinDemo.java:78   The output that is underlined in the listing, represents the test case for the next     method. This method should be used to read a single String token. The next token gets  converted to a String instance, and the token ends when a whitespace is encountered.  That is why, in the previous example the only read text ends up being the.  In the last case, the expected option is an integer value, but AAAA is entered, and   that is why the exception is thrown.  When you need to repeatedly read the same type of values from the console you   can peek at the value you want to read, and check it before reading it to avoid the  InputMismatchException being thrown. For this particular scenario, each of the next..     methods has a pair method named hasNext...  . To show an example of how these  methods can be used, let’s add an option to the previous code to read a list of long  values.  416   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  ... public static final String LONGS = "longs"; ...   String input;         do {             System.out.print "Enter option: " ;             input = sc.nextLine  ;              switch  input  {                case LONGS:        List  longList = new ArrayList   ;        while  sc.hasNextLong    {            longList.add sc.nextLong   ;        }        System.out.println "Nice long list there: " + longList ;           else all done        sc.nextLine  ;        sc.nextLine  ;        break;    default:        System.out.println "No idea what you want bruh!" ;             }         } while  !input.equalsIgnoreCase EXIT  ; ...  Although seems weird, we need to call the nextLine   method twice. Once for the   character that cannot be converted to long, so the while loop ends and once for the end  of the line character, so the next read..   is the type of the following read value.  There are a few other methods in the Scanner class that can be used to filter the   input and read only desired tokens, but the methods listed in this section are the ones  you will probably use the most.   Reading User Data with java.io.Console The java.io.Console class was introduced in Java version 1.6, one version later than  Scanner; it provides methods to access he character-based console device, if any,  associated with the current Java virtual machine. The methods of class java.io.Console   417   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  can thus be also used to write to the console, not only read user input. If the JVM is  started from a background process or a Java editor, the console will not be available, as  the editor redirects the standard input and output streams to its own window. That is  why if we were to write code using Console we can only test it by running the class or jar  from a terminal by calling java ReadingUsingConsoleDemo.class or java -jar using-  console- 1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar. The console of a JVM, if available, is represented in the  code by a single instance of the Console class, which can be obtained by calling System. console  .  Figure 10.2.  Console methods  Figure 10-2 shows the methods that can be called on the console instance. The read* ..  methods are used to read user input from the console and   printf ..  and format ..  are used to print text in the console. The special cases here  are the two readPassword ..  methods that allow text to be read from the console, but  not depicted while it is being written. This means that a Java application supporting  authentication can be written without any actual user interface. Let’s write a sample  code to see all that in action.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import java.io.Console; import java.util.Calendar; import java.util.GregorianCalendar;  public class ReadingUsingConsoleDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         Console console = System.console  ;  418   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive          if  console == null  {             System.err.println "No console found." ;             return;         } else {             console.writer  .print "Hello there!  reply to salute \n" ;             console.flush  ;              String hello = console.readLine  ;             console.printf "You replied with: '" + hello + "'\n" ;              Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar  ;             console.format "Today is : %1$tm %1$te,%1$tY\n", calendar ;              char[] passwordChar =             console.readPassword "Please provide password: " ;             String password =  new String passwordChar ;             console.printf "Your password starts with '"      + password.charAt 0  + "' and ends with '"      + password.charAt password.length  -1  + "'\n" ;         }     } }  In the code sample, various methods to read and write data using the console were   used to show you how they should be used.  The console.writer   returns an instance of java.io.PrintWriter that can be  used to print messages to the console. The catch is that the messages are not printed  until console.flush   is called. This means that more messages can be queued up by  the java.io.PrintWriter instance and printed only when flush   is called or when its  internal buffer is full.  The console.format ..  is called to print a formatted message, in this case a  Calendar instance extracts the current date and print it according to the following  template: dd mm,yyyy . Templates accepted by the console methods that use formatters  are defined in the java.util.Formatter class.  And now the good part: running this code in IntelliJ is not possible, so we have to   either execute the class or the jar in a terminal. The easiest way is to create an executable  jar, Gradle creates one when gradle clean build is executed, because    419   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  the configuration was setup for the generated jar to be executable and for the main   class to be ReadingUsingConsoleDemo. The jar produced by Gradle can be found at    chapter10 using-console build libs using-console-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar. Open a  terminal in IntelliJ IDEA if you want to by clicking the Terminal button, and go to the  libs directory. Once there, execute java -jar using-console-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and  have fun. In the following code listing, you can see the entries I used to test the program.  $ cd chapter10 using-console build libs  $ java -jar using-console-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Hello there!  reply to salute  Salut! You replayed with: 'Salut!' Today is : 08 9,2018 Please provide password: Your password starts with 'a' and ends with 'e'  And this is all you need to know about using the console, although once working on   a real production-ready project, you might rarely need it.   Build Applications Using Swing Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. It is part of the JDK starting with version 1.2 and  was developed to provide more pleasant looking and practical components for building  user applications with complex interfaces with all types of buttons, progress bars,  selectable lists, and so forth. Swing is based on an early version of something called  AWT short for Abstract Window Toolkit, which is the original Java user-interface widget  toolkit. AWT was pretty basic, and had a set of graphical interface components that were  available on any platform, this means AWT was portable, but this did not imply that AWT  code written on one platform would work on another, because of the platform specific  limitations. AWT components depend on the native equivalent components, which is  why they were called heavyweight components. Figure 10-3 shows a simple Java AWT  application.  420   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Figure 10-3.  Simple Java AWT application  It’s a simple window that contains a list, a text area and a button. The theme, also  called the look-and-feel of the application, is the same as the operating system it was  built on—macOS in the examples in this chapter— and it cannot be changed, AWT taps  into the OS native graphical interface. If you run the same code on a Windows machine,  the window will look different, because it will use the Windows theme.  Swing components are built in Java, follow the AWT model, but provide a pluggable   look-and-feel. Swing is implemented entirely in Java and includes all features of AWT,  but they are no longer depending on the native GUI, this is why Swing components are  called lightweight components. Swing provides everything AWT does and also extends  the set of components with higher-level ones such as tree view, list box, and tabbed  panes. Also, the theme is pluggable and can be easily changed. This implies a much  better portability than AWT applications, a possibility to write more complex application  design with components that are not platform specific, and because Swing is an  alternative to AWT, there was a lot more development done.  421   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  When web applications took flight, they were really ugly, because browsers had limited  capabilities. AWT was introduced to build Java web applications called applets. Java applets  were small applications that were launched from the browser and then executed within the  JVM installed on the user’s operating system in a process separate from the browser itself.  That is why an applet can be run in a frame of the web page, a new application window,  or standalone tools designed for testing applets. Java applets were using the GUI from the  operating system, which made them prettier than the bulky initial look of HTML at the time.  They are now deprecated and are scheduled to be removed in Java 11.  As for Java desktop applications written in Swing or AWT, they are rarely used   anymore, and you might learn to build one during school, but are otherwise … they  are considered antique. Nevertheless, there are legacy applications used by certain  institutions and companies that have had a long run in their business, which are built  with Swing. I’ve seen Swing applications used by restaurants to manage tables and  orders and I think most supermarkets use Swing applications to manage shopping  items. And this is why this section exists in this book, because you might end up working  on maintaining such application and it is good to know the basics, because Swing is  still a part of the JDK. All Swing components  AWT too  are part of the java.desktop  module so if you want to use Swing components you have to declare a dependence on  this module. In the following configuration snippet, you can see that the module of our  project that uses Swing declares its dependency on the java.desktop module by using  the requires directive, in its module-info.java.  The application depicted in Figure 10-3 was build using AWT, this section covers   building something similar in Swing and adding more components to it. The core class  of any Swing application is named JFrame and instances of this type are used to create  windows with border and title. So let’s write some code to do just that.  module chapter.ten.swing {     requires java.desktop; }  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*;  422   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  public class SwingDemo extends JFrame {      public static void main String... args  {         SwingDemo swingDemo = new SwingDemo  ;         swingDemo.setTitle "Swing Demo Window" ;         swingDemo.setSize new Dimension 500,500  ;          swingDemo.setVisible true ;     } }  In the code, an instance of javax.swing.JFrame is created, a title is set for it and   we also set a size so when the window is created we can see something. To display the  window, the setVisible true  must be called on the JFrame instance. When you run  the previous code, a window like the one depicted in Figure 10-4 is displayed. By default  the window is positioned in the upper left corner of your main monitor, but that can be  changed by using some Swing components to compute a position relative to the screen  size. Determining size and position of a Swing window relative to screen size is only  limited by the amount of math you are willing to get into. Figure 10-4 shows a simple Java  Swing Window.  Figure 10-4.  Simple Java Swing application  423   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  At this moment, if we close the displayed window, the application keeps running.   Because by default, closing the window makes it invisible by calling setVisible false .  If we want to change the default behavior to exiting the application we have to change  the default operation performed when closing the window. This can be easily done by  adding the following line of code after creating the JFrame instance.  swingDemo.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ;  The JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE constant is part of a set of constants that define   application behavior when the window is closed. This one declares that the application  should exit when the window is closed. The other available options are depicted in the  following list:  DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE - does nothing, including closing the window.              HIDE_ON_CLOSE - the default option, which causes  setVisible false  to be called.  DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE - an application can have more than one window,  this option exits the application when the last displayable window is  closed.  Most Swing applications are written by extending the JFrame class to gain more   control over its component, so the preceding code can also be written like this:  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*;  public class SwingDemo extends JFrame {      public static void main String... args  {         SwingDemo swingDemo = new SwingDemo  ;         swingDemo.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ;         swingDemo.setTitle "Swing Demo Window" ;         swingDemo.setSize new Dimension 500,500  ;          swingDemo.setVisible true ;     } }  424   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  And now that we have a window, let’s start adding components, because changing  the look-and-feel is pointless if we do not have more components so we can notice the  change. Each Swing application has at least one JFrame that is the root, the parent of all  other windows, because windows can be created by using the JDialog class as well. The  JDialog is the main class for creating a dialog window, a special type of window that  contains mostly a message and buttons to select options. Developers can use this class  to create a custom dialogs or use JOptionPane class methods to create a variety of dialog  windows.  Back to adding components to a JFrame instance; components are added to a JFrame   by adding them to its container. A reference to the JFrame container can be retrieved  by calling getContentPane  . The default content pane is a simple intermediate  container that inherits from JComponent, which extends java.awt.Container  Swing  being an extension of AWT, most of its components are AWT extensions . For JFrame,  the default content pane is an instance of JPane. This class has a field of type java.awt. LayoutManager that defines how other components are arranged in a JPane. The default  content pane of a JFrame instance, uses a java.awt.BorderLayout as its layout manager,  which splits a pane into five regions: EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, and CENTER. Each  of the zones can be referred by a constant with a matching name defined in the  BorderLayout. So if we would like to add an exit button to our application, we could add  it to the south region by writing the following code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; import java.awt.event.ActionListener;  public class SwingDemo extends JFrame {     private JPanel mainPanel;     private JButton exitButton;      public SwingDemo String title  {         super title ;         mainPanel =  JPanel  this.getContentPane  ;         exitButton = new JButton "Bye Bye!" ;         exitButton.addActionListener new ActionListener   {             @Override  425   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive              public void actionPerformed ActionEvent e  {    System.exit 0 ;             }         } ;         mainPanel.add exitButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH ;     }      public static void main String... args  {         SwingDemo swingDemo = new SwingDemo "Swing Demo Window" ;         swingDemo.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE ;         swingDemo.setSize new Dimension 500, 500  ;          swingDemo.setVisible true ;     } }  Figure 10-5 shows the modified application. We’ve added an exit button in the   SOUTH area of the content pane and underlined the overall region arrangement of the  BorderLayout.  Figure 10-5.  Border layout zones  426   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Also, because the new button has to be the only way to exit our application, the set   DefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ; was replaced with setDefaultClose  Operation JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE ; and an java.awt.event.ActionListener  instance was attached to the button, so it could record the event of the button  being clicked and react accordingly, in this case exiting the application. Most Swing  components support listeners that can be defined to capture events that are performed  on the object by the user and react in a certain way.  As you can see, the button expands and fills the entire space of the region, because it  inherits the dimension of the region. To avoid that, the button should be put in another  container and that container should use a different layout: the FlowLayout. As the name  implies, this layout allows for Swing components to be added in a directional flow, like  in a paragraph. Adjustments can be made similar to a text formatting in text document  and constants are defined for components being aligned: in the center  CENTER , left-  justified  LEFT , and so forth. In the next code sample, we wrapped the exitButton in a  JPanel that makes use of the FlowLayout.  ...  public SwingDemo String title  {         super title ;         mainPanel =  JPanel  this.getContentPane  ;          exitButton = new JButton "Bye Bye!" ;         exitButton.addActionListener e -> System.exit 0  ;          JPanel exitPanel = new JPanel  ;         FlowLayout flowLayout = new FlowLayout  ;         flowLayout.setAlignment FlowLayout.RIGHT ;         exitPanel.setLayout flowLayout ;          exitPanel.setComponentOrientation ComponentOrientation.RIGHT_TO_LEFT ;         exitPanel.add exitButton ;          mainPanel.add exitPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH ;     } ...  427   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  There are more layouts that can be used, but let’s complete the application by adding   a list with a number of entries and add a listener to it so when you click an element it is  added to a text area in the center of the frame. A swing list can be created by instantiating  the JList  class. This creates an object that displays a list of objects and allows the  user to select one or more items. The swing JList  class contains a field of type  ListModel  that manages the data contents displayed by the list. When created and  elements were added, each object is associated with an index, and when the user selects  an object the index can be used for processing as well. In the next snippet the JList  object is declared, initialized, a ListSelectionListener is associated with it, to define  the action to perform when an element from the list is selected. In our case the element  value, must be added to a JTextArea, so this object is depicted in the code.  private static  String[] data = {"John Mayer", "Frank Sinatra",       "Seth MacFarlane", "Nina Simone", "BB King", "Peggy Lee"};    private JList  list;   private JTextArea textArea;  ...         textArea = new JTextArea 50, 10 ;            NORTH         list = new JList  data ;         list.addListSelectionListener new ListSelectionListener   {             @Override             public void valueChanged ListSelectionEvent e  {    if  !e.getValueIsAdjusting    {        textArea.append list.getSelectedValue   + "\n" ;    }             }         } ;         mainPanel.add list, BorderLayout.NORTH ;            CENTER         JScrollPane txtPanel = new JScrollPane textArea ;         textArea.setBackground Color.LIGHT_GRAY ;         mainPanel.add txtPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER ;   ...  428   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  If you click a list element, two things happen: the previous element is deselected, and   one that was clicked the most recently is selected, so the selected element changes. The  getValueIsAdjusting   method returns whether or not this is one in a series of multiple  events, where changes are still being made, and we test if this method returns false to  check that the selection has been already made, so we can get the value of the current  selected element and add it to the text area.  Regarding the JTextArea instance, this one is added to a JScrollPane instance, which  allows for the textArea contents to still be visible as it fills with text by providing a scrollbar  or two, depending on the configuration. The JScrollPane can also be wrapped around a list  with too many items to make sure all of them are accessible. Also, as we are not interested in  user provided input via the text area, the setEditable false ; method is called.  Now that we have a more complex application, it is time to play with the look-and-  feel of the application. Until now, we’ve used the default one, the one provided by the  underlying Operation System. But with Swing, the look-and-feel can be configured as  one of the defaults supported by the JDK or extra custom ones can be used, which are  provided as dependencies in the project class path, or developers can create their own.  To specify a look-and-feel explicitly, the following line of code must be added in the  main method, before any swing component is created: UIManager.setLookAndFeel .. .  This method receives as parameter a String value representing the fully qualified  name of the appropriate subclass of look-and-feel. Although not necessary, you  could specify explicitly that you want to use the native GUI by calling: UIManager. setLookAndFeel UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName   ;. Knowing  this, let’s do something interesting. The UIManager class contains utility methods and  nested classes used to manage look-and-feel for swing applications. One of this methods  is getInstalledLookAndFeels  , which extracts the list of supported look-and-feels  and returns them as a LookAndFeelInfo[]. Knowing this, let’s list all the supported  themes, add them to our list, and when the user selects one of them, let’s apply them.  Unfortunately, as swing is rarely used these days, there are not that many custom  look-  and- feels that we could use in our application. So, the only thing to do is to work with  what JDK has. First, let’s initialize the data array with the fully qualified class names.  private static  String[] data; ...    public static void main String... args  throws Exception {          UIManager.setLookAndFeel UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeel   ClassName   ;  429   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive           UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[] looks = UIManager.getInstalledLookAnd   Feels  ;          data = new String[looks.length];         int i =0;         for  UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo look : looks  {             data[i++] = look.getClassName  ;         }          SwingDemo swingDemo = new SwingDemo "Swing Demo Window" ;         swingDemo.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE ;         swingDemo.setSize new Dimension 500, 500  ;          swingDemo.setVisible true ;     } ...  Now, the ListSelectionListener implementation becomes a little complicated,   because after selecting a new look and feel class, we have to call repaint   on the  JFrame instance to apply the new look and feel, so we’ll take the declaration out into its  own class and provide the SwingDemo object as argument, so repaint   can be  called on it, inside the valueChanged ..  method.  private class LFListener implements ListSelectionListener {          private JFrame parent;          public LFListener JFrame swingDemo  {             parent = swingDemo;         }          @Override         public void valueChanged ListSelectionEvent e  {             if  !e.getValueIsAdjusting    {    textArea.append list.getSelectedValue   + "\n" ;    try {        UIManager.setLookAndFeel list.getSelectedValue   ;        Thread.sleep 1000 ;        parent.repaint  ;    } catch  Exception ee  {  430   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive         System.err.println " Could not set look and feel! " ;    }             }         }  }  If we run the modified program, and select each item in the list one by one, we   should see the window look change a little bit. Figure 10-6 shows all windows side by  side; the differences are barely noticeable, but they are there.  Figure 10-6.  Different Look And Feel provided by JDK  This is what you can do with Swing components with a few lines of code. There are   a lot more components that in the Swing library, but as it not really used anymore, as  the focus is on web applications, this section has to end here. If you ever need to create  or maintain a Swing application, Oracle provides an extensive tutorial with a lot of  examples that you can directly copy paste and adapt to your necessities. 2  2 Oracle extensive Swing tutorial: https:  docs.oracle.com javase tutorial uiswing  examples layout index.html  431   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive   Introducing JavaFX JavaFX Script was a scripting language designed by Sun Microsystems, forming part  of the JavaFX family of technologies on the Java Platform. It was released shortly after  JDK 6 in December 2008 and for a while developers expected it to be dropped because  it really did not catch on that much, being a totally different language and all. But after  acquiring Sun Microsystems, Oracle decided to keep it and they transformed it into  the JavaFX library, which is a set of graphics and media packages that can be used by  developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy rich client applications that operate  consistently across diverse platforms. And yes, mobile ones too. JavaFX is intended to  replace Swing as the main GUI library of the JDK, but so far, both Swing and JavaFX have  been part of all JDK versions until 10. That changed in JDK 11. Starting with JDK 11,   JavaFX is available as a separate module, decoupled from the JDK. JavaFX is still not used  as much as Oracle hoped, and separating it from the JDK might encourage the OpenJFX  community to contribute with some innovative ideas, which might transform this library  into an actual competitor for the other existing GUI toolkits on the market  e.g., Eclipse  SWT3 . So let’s waste no time and start writing code to create an application similar to  the previous one using JavaFX.  Being part of the JDK now, and having classes and other components, JavaFX code is  currently normal Java code, so no more scripting. JavaFX components are defined under  a list of java.fx.* modules. The following configuration snippet, shows that the module  of our project that uses JavaFX declares its dependency on a few java.fx modules by  using the requires directive, in its module-info.java.  module chapter.ten.javafx {     requires javafx.base;     requires javafx.graphics;     requires javafx.controls;     opens com.apress.bgn.ch10 to javafx.graphics; }  3 SWT is an open source widget toolkit for Java designed to provide efficient, portable access to the  user-interface facilities of the operating systems on which it is implemented. More about it on  the official site: https:  www.eclipse.org swt   432   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  And because the JavaFX application launcher uses reflection to launch an   application, you need to open the package containing the implementation; otherwise,  an java.lang.IllegalAccessException is thrown, so that is why in the previous  configuration the opens com.apress.bgn.ch10; exists.  Let’s start with a simple window that has a closing option. I’ll explain how it is   executed because JavaFX is a little different from Swing and AWT. The code to display a  plain square window is depicted next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane; import javafx.stage.Stage;  public class JavaFxDemo extends Application {     public static void main String... args  {         launch args ;     }      @Override     public void start Stage primaryStage  {         primaryStage.setTitle "JavaFX Demo Window!" ;          StackPane root = new StackPane  ;         primaryStage.setScene new Scene root, 500, 500  ;         primaryStage.show  ;     } }  The first thing you need to know is that the main class of the application must   extend the javafx.application.Application class, because this is the entry point for  a JavaFX application. This is required because JAVA FX applications are run by a new  performance graphics engine named Prism that sits on top of the JVM. Aside from  Prism, the graphic engine, JavaFX comes with its own windowing system named Glass, a  media engine and a web engine. They are not exposed publicly, the only thing available  to developers is the JavaFX API that provides access to any components you might need  to build application with fancy interfaces. All of these engines are tied together by the   433   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Quantum toolkit, which is the interface between these engines and the layer above in  the stack. The Quantum toolkit manages execution threads and rendering.  The launch ...  method is a static method in the Application class that launches   a standalone application. It is usually called from the main method and can only be  called once; otherwise, a java.lang.IllegalStateException is thrown. The launch  method does not return until the application is exited by closing all windows or calling  Platform.exit  . The launch method creates an JavaFxDemo instance, calls the init    method on it and then calls start .. . The start ..  method is declared abstract in  the Application class, so the developer is forced to provide a concrete implementation.  A JavaFX application is built using components defined under the javafx.scene   and has a hierarchical organization. The core class of the javafx.scene package is the  javafx.scene.Node that is the root of the Scene hierarchy. Classes in this hierarchy  provide implementations for all of the visual elements of the application’s user interface.  Because all of them have Node as a root class, visual elements are called nodes, which  makes an application a scene graph of nodes and the initial node of this graph is called a  root. Each node has an unique identifier, a style class and a bounding volume, and with  the exception of the root node, each node in the graph has a single parent and zero or  more children. Aside from that a node has the following properties.  effects, such as blurs and shadow - useful when you hover with your  mouse over the interface to make sure you click the right component  transformations - changing visual state or position  event handlers - similar to listeners in Swing, used to define reaction  on mouse, key and input method      application specific state  The scene graph simplifies building rich interfaces a lot and, because it also includes   graphics primitives as rectangles, text, images and media and also, animating various  graphics can be accomplished by the animation APIs for package javax.animation.  If you are interested in finding out more on what’s under the hood of JavaFX, read the  article at https:  docs.oracle.com javafx 2 architecture jfxpub-architecture. htm, because the focus of this book is on how to do things rather than how they work,  unless it really influences the design of your future solutions.     opacity              434   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  We’ve started again with a simple window. The first step is to add a button to quit the   application. As rendering a JavaFX application involves a rendering engine, this means  it has to shutdown gracefully, so calling System.exit 0  is no longer a preferred option.  So the contents of the start ..  methods become the following.  ... public void start Stage primaryStage  {         primaryStage.setTitle "JavaFX Demo Window!" ;          Button btn = new Button  ;         btn.setText "Bye bye! " ;         btn.setOnAction new EventHandler    {              @Override             public void handle ActionEvent event  {    Platform.exit  ;             }         } ;          StackPane root = new StackPane  ;         root.getChildren  .add btn ;         primaryStage.setScene new Scene root, 500, 500  ;         primaryStage.show  ;     } ...  If we run the JavaFxDemo class, the window depicted in Figure 10-7 pops up on your  screen, and if you click the Bye bye! Button, the application is gracefully closed because  of the Platform.exit  ; call.  435   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Figure 10-7.  JavaFX Window Demo  But the button was just thrown in the window and put in the center by default  because no code was written to position it. JavaFX supports arranging nodes4 in a  window in a manner similar to Swing, but JavaFX provides layout panes that support  several different styles of layouts. The equivalent of a JPane with BorderLayout manager  in JavaFX is a built-in layout named BorderPane. The BorderPane provides five regions  where to place your nodes, with distribution similar to BorderLayout, but different  names. Let’s write the code to place our button in the bottom region in the right corner  and then discuss more about it.  ...  public void start Stage primaryStage  {         primaryStage.setTitle "JavaFX Demo Window!" ;          Button exitButton = new Button  ;         exitButton.setText "Bye bye! " ;         exitButton.setOnAction event -> Platform.exit   ;          BorderPane borderPane = new BorderPane  ;         HBox box = new HBox  ;  4 It was mentioned that the root class for all Java FX components is named Node, so instead of  components, Java FX components is referred as nodes in this section.  436   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive          box.setPadding new Insets 10, 12, 10, 12  ;         box.setSpacing 10 ;         box.setAlignment Pos.BASELINE_RIGHT ;         box.setStyle "-fx-background-color: 85929e;" ;         box.getChildren  .add exitButton ;         borderPane.setBottom box ;          StackPane root = new StackPane  ;         root.getChildren  .add borderPane ;         primaryStage.setScene new Scene root, 500, 500  ;         primaryStage.show  ;     } ...  If we run the JavaFxDemo class the window depicted in Figure 10-8 pop up on your   screen. The figure has been modified to show the regions of a BorderPane.  Figure 10-8.  JavaFX Window Demo  437   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  The approach to decide where our button should be located is similar to Swing,   with a few differences. The BorderPane has 5 regions named: Top, Bottom, Center, Left  and Right. To place a node in each of those regions a set* ..  method for each of them  has been defined: setTop .. , setBottom .. , setCenter .. , setLeft ..  and  setRight .. . To further customize the position of the node, it should be placed in a  HBox node, another JavaFX element that can be customized extensively. As you can see  from the code, we are setting the background using CSS style elements, we customize  the space between nodes in it and borders of the containing node by using an instance  of class Insets and we customize the alignment of the contained nodes by calling  box.setAlignment Pos.BASELINE_RIGHT . And there are a lot more things that HBox  supports, so what you can do with a box is limited  mostly  only by your imagination.  So aside from all making pretty code in the preceding code sample, this was   done: the root node became parent to a BorderPane node, in the bottom region of the  BorderPane, a HBox was added, and this HBox instance became parent for a Button. This  organization is hierarchic, with the button being the last node in the hierarchy.  Also, we avoided using a layer pane by styling the HBox node properly. It is time to add the last functionality to our application: the text area and a list   with selectable elements to add values to the text area. To create a text area in JavaFX  is simple. The class is named in an clear manner: TextArea. We can directly add the  node in the center region of the BorderPane because the JavaFX text area is scrollable  by default. So there is no need to put it in a ScrollPane, although the class does exist in  the javafx.scene.control package and is useful to display nodes inside it that make  a form that is bigger than the window size. The following three lines of code create a  node of type TextArea, declare it to not be editable, and add it to the center region of the  BorderPane.  TextArea textArea = new TextArea  ; textArea.setEditable false ; borderPane.setCenter textArea ;  Next one is the list. The list is a little more complicated, but also a lot more fun   to work with, because using JavaFX there is a lot you can do with a list. The class that  needs to be instantiated to create a list object is named ComboBox. This class is just  one of a bigger family of classes used to create lists, the root class being the abstract  class ComboBoxBase. Depending on the desired behavior of the list, if we want support  for single or multiple selection, if we want the list to be editable or not, the proper  implementation should be chosen. In our case, the ComboBox class matches the   438   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  requirements: we need a non-editable list, which supports single element section.   A ComboBox has a valueProperty   method that returns the current user input. The user  input can be based on a selection from a drop-down list or the input manually provided  by the user when the list is editable. Let’s see the code to add a list to the top section of  the BorderPane and add a listener to record the selected value in the TextArea that we  previously declared.  private static String[] data = {"John Mayer", "Frank Sinatra",    "Seth MacFarlane", "Nina Simone", "BB King", "Peggy Lee"}; ... ComboBox  comboBox = new ComboBox   ; comboBox.getItems  .addAll data ; borderPane.setTop comboBox ;  comboBox.valueProperty  .addListener    new ChangeListener    {     @Override      public void changed ObservableValue  observable,          String oldValue, String newValue  {          textArea.appendText newValue + "\n" ;       } } ;  The ComboBox value field  accessed by calling comboBox.valueProperty      is an ObservableValue  instance. The listener is an instance of type  ChangeListener  is added to this instance by calling the addListener ..   method. Anytime the comboBox value field changes, the changed ..  method of the  listener is called. The changed ..  method receives as argument the previous list  selected value as well as the currently selected value, because who knows, maybe we  have some logic that requires both.  In AWT and Swing, there was not much that you could do with a list visually. You had  the look and feel and that was that. JavaFX supports more visual customization for nodes  because it even supports CSS. That is why in the next section we’ll make our ComboBox  list interesting. In JavaFX each entry in a list is a cell that can be drawn differently. To do  that, we have to add a CellFactory to this class, which creates an instance of ListCell  for each item in a list. If a CellFactory is not specified the cells is created with the  default style. Let’s see the code first and explain more after.  439   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  comboBox.setCellFactory     new Callback    {        @Override        public ListCell  call ListView  param  {            return new ListCell    {                       {       super.setPrefWidth 200 ;                }                 @Override                public void updateItem String item, boolean empty  {       super.updateItem item, empty ;       if  item != null  {           setText item ;           if  item.contains "John"   item.contains "BB"   {               setTextFill Color.RED ;           } else if  item.contains "Frank"   item.contains "Peggy"   {               setTextFill Color.GREEN ;           } else if  item.contains "Seth"   {               setTextFill Color.BLUE ;           } else {               setTextFill Color.BLACK ;           }       } else {           setText null ;       }                }            };        }    } ;  The javafx.util.Callback interface is a practical interface that can be used to   declare a subsequent action for a certain action, if a callback is needed. In this case the  subsequent action is doing the following: after a String value is added to the ListView of  the ComboBox node  ListView is the visual, the interface type of a ComboBox that displays  a horizontal or vertical list of items , a cell is being created and some piece of logic was  inserted there to decide the color of the text depicted in the cell based on its value.  440   Inside the ListCell declaration there is a block of code that seems out of place.  Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  {         super.setPrefWidth 200 ;  }  The block is an interesting way to call a method from the parent class inside the   declaration of an anonymous class. The setPrefWidth 200  is called here to make sure  all the ListCell  instances have the same size. The logic in the updateItem ..  is  quite obvious, and thus it does not need any extended explanation. The result of adding  the cell factory can be viewed in Figure 10-9.  And this is all the space we can give to JavaFX in this book. As long as you have a   vague idea of why the JavaFX components are called nodes, you have a pretty good  starting point. If you are curious, Oracle has some pretty good tutorials about it at  https:  docs.oracle.com javase 8 javase-clienttechnologies.htm.  Figure 10-9.  JavaFX Colored ComboBox Demo  441   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive   Internationalization Interactive applications are usually created to be deployed on more than one server  and available 24 7 and in multiple locations. As not all of us speak the speak the same  language, the key to convince people to become your clients and use your application  is to build it in multiple languages. The process of designing an application so that it  meets user needs in multiple countries and easily adapts to satisfy those needs is called  internationalization. For example we can take the initial Google page. Depending on  the location where it is accessed, it changes language according to that area. When you  create an account, you can select the language you prefer. This does not mean that the  Google has built a web application for each region, it’s a single web application that  displays text in different languages depending on the location. Internationalization  should always be taken into consideration in the design phase of an application,  because adding it later is difficult. We do not have a web application, but we are  internationalizing a JavaFX application in this section.  When you start reading about internationalization you might notice that files or   directories containing the internationalization property files are named i18n, which is  because there are 18 letters between i and n in this word.  Internationalization is based on locale. Locale is the term given to a combination   of language and region. The application locale is the one that decides which  internationalization file customizes the application. The locale concept is implemented  in Java by the java.util.Locale class and a Locale instance represents a geographical,  political or cultural region. When an application depends on the locale we say that it  is locale-sensitive, as most applications are nowadays. But selecting a locale can be  something an user has to do as well. Each Locale can select the corresponding locale  resources, these are files containing locale specific configurations. These files are  grouped per locale and can usually be found under the resources directory. These  resources are used to configure an instance of java.util.ResourceBundle that can  manage locale- specific resources.  To build a proper use case for localization, the previous JavaFX application is   modified; instead of singer names, the list contains a list of pet names with labels that  can be translated in various languages. A list with the available languages is added,  and when a language is selected from this list, a Locale static variable is set with the  corresponding locale and the window is reinitialized so that all labels can be translated  to the new language. Let’s start by creating the resource files.  442   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Resource files have the properties extension that contain a list of properties and  values. Each line respects the following pattern: property_name=property_value, if  it doesn’t, it is not read. Each property name must be unique in the file, if there is a  duplicate it is ignored and IntelliJ IDEA complains by underlining the property with  red. For every language that needs to be supported, we need to create one property file  that contains the same property names, but different values, as the values represent  the translation of that value in each language. All files must have names that contain  a common suffix and end with the language name and the country, separated by  underscores, because these are the two elements needed to create a Locale instance. For  our JavaFX application, we have three files, which are depicted in Figure 10-10.  Figure 10-10.  Resource Bundle with three resource files  The suffix is global and this is our resource bundle name as well. This is made clear   by IntelliJ IDEA, which figures out what our files are used for and depicts them in an  obvious way. The contents of the files is depicted in Table 10-1.  443   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Table 10-1.  Contents of Resource Files  Property Name Property value in   global_en_GB  Property value in   global_fr_FR  Property value in   global_it_IT  english  French  italian  Cat  Dog  parrot  Mouse  Cow  pig  english  French  italian  Cat  Dog  parrot  Mouse  Cow  pig  anglais  Français  italien  Chat  Chien  Chien  Souris  perroquet  porc  inglese  Francese  italiano  gatto  Cane  pappagallo  topo  Mucca  Maiale  Ciao!

Choosepet  Choose pet:  Choisissez la langue:  Scegli la lingua:  Chooselanguage Choose language:  Scegli un animale domestico  Choisir un animal de  compagnie:  IntelliJ IDEA can help you edit resource bundle files easily and makes sure you are  not missing any keys from any of them by providing a special view for them. When you  open a resource file, in the bottom left corner you should see two tabs. One is called Text  and when clicked, it allows you to edit a properties file as a normal text file. The other  one is called Resource Bundle and when clicked, it opens a special view that has all the  property names in the resource files and views from all resource files containing values  for property names selected. Figure 10-11 shows this view and the values for the Choose  Language property.  444   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Figure 10-11.  Resource Bundle IntelliJ IDEA editor  The property names can contain special characters as underscore and dots to   separate parts of them. In this book example the property names are simple, because we  only have so little of them. In bigger applications, property names usually contain a prefix  that is relevant to their purpose, for example if the property value is a title the name is  prefixed with title. For example, the property names in our files could be changed to  the following:  English --> label.lang.english French --> label.lang.french Italian --> label.lang.italian Cat --> label.pet.cat Dog --> label.pet.dog Parrot --> label.pet.parrot Mouse --> label.pet.mouse Cow --> label.pet.cow Pig --> label.pet.pig WindowTitle --> title.window Byebye --> label.button.byebye ChoosePet --> label.choose.pet ChooseLanguage --> label.choose.language  445   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Now that we have covered how the resource files should be written, let’s see how   they are used. To create a ResourceBundle instance, we first need a locale. Applications  have a default locale that can be obtained by calling Locale.getDefault  , and a  ResourceBundle instance can be obtained by using a bundle name and a locale instance,  as depicted in the following code snippet.  Locale locale = Locale.getDefault  ; ResourceBundle labels = ResourceBundle.getBundle "global", locale ;  When a valid ResourceBundle is obtained, it can replace all hard-coded String   instances with calls to return text values from the resource file matching the selected  locale. So, every time we need to set a label for a node, instead of using the actual text, we  use a call to resourceBundle.getString "[property_name]"  to get the localized text. When a JavaFX window is reloaded, all its nodes are re-created. To influence how,  we need to add a couple of static properties to keep the selected locale set. So, for the  application that we’ve build so far, after internationalizing it, the code looks like the one  in the next listing.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javafx.*;  import java.io.File; import java.net.URL; import java.net.URLClassLoader; import java.util.Locale; import java.util.ResourceBundle; public class JavaFxDemo extends Application {      private static final String BUNDLE_LOCATION =          "chapter10 using-javafx src main resources";      private static ResourceBundle resourceBundle = null;     private static Locale locale = new Locale "en", "GB" ;     private static int selectedLang = 0;      public static void main String... args  {         Application.launch args ;     }  446   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive      @Override     public void start Stage primaryStage  throws Exception {         loadLocale locale ;         primaryStage.setTitle resourceBundle.getString "WindowTitle"  ;          String[] data = {resourceBundle.getString "Cat" ,                  resourceBundle.getString "Dog" ,                 resourceBundle.getString "Parrot" ,                 resourceBundle.getString "Mouse" ,                 resourceBundle.getString "Cow" ,                 resourceBundle.getString "Pig" };          BorderPane borderPane = new BorderPane  ;            Top         final ComboBox  comboBox = new ComboBox   ;         comboBox.getItems  .addAll data ;          final ComboBox  langList = new ComboBox   ;          String[] languages = {                 resourceBundle.getString "English" ,                  resourceBundle.getString "French" ,                 resourceBundle.getString "Italian" };          langList.getItems  .addAll languages ;         langList.getSelectionModel  .select selectedLang ;          GridPane gridPane = new GridPane  ;         gridPane.setHgap 10 ;         gridPane.setVgap 10 ;           Label labelLang = new Label resourceBundle.getString "Choose   Language"  ;          gridPane.add labelLang, 0, 0 ;         gridPane.add langList, 1, 0 ;          Label labelPet = new Label resourceBundle.getString "ChoosePet"  ;         gridPane.add labelPet, 0, 1 ;         gridPane.add comboBox, 1, 1 ;  447   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive          borderPane.setTop gridPane ;            Center         final TextArea textArea = new TextArea  ;         textArea.setEditable false ;         borderPane.setCenter textArea ;          comboBox.valueProperty  .addListener  observable, oldValue, newValue                  -> textArea.appendText newValue + "\n"  ;          langList.valueProperty  .addListener  observable, oldValue, newValue                  -> {             int idx = langList.getSelectionModel  .getSelectedIndex  ;             selectedLang = idx;             if  idx == 0  {                   locale = Locale.getDefault  ;                 new Locale "en", "GB" ;             } else if  idx == 1  {                 locale = new Locale "fr", "FR" ;             } else {                 locale = new Locale "it", "IT" ;             }              primaryStage.close  ;             Platform.runLater    -> {                 try {                     new JavaFxDemo  .start new Stage   ;                 } catch  Exception e  {                     System.err.println "Could not reload application!" ;                 }             } ;         } ;          HBox box = new HBox  ;         box.setPadding new Insets 10, 12, 10, 12  ;         box.setSpacing 10 ;         box.setAlignment Pos.BASELINE_RIGHT ;  448   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive          box.setStyle "-fx-background-color: 85929e;" ;         Button exitButton = new Button  ;         exitButton.setText resourceBundle.getString "Byebye"  ;         exitButton.setOnAction event -> Platform.exit   ;         box.getChildren  .add exitButton ;         borderPane.setBottom box ;            Bottom         StackPane root = new StackPane  ;         root.getChildren  .add borderPane ;         primaryStage.setScene new Scene root, 500, 500  ;         primaryStage.show  ;     }      private void loadLocale Locale locale  throws Exception {         File file = new File BUNDLE_LOCATION ;          URL[] url = {file.toURI  .toURL  };         ClassLoader loader = new URLClassLoader url ;          resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle "global", locale, loader ;     } }  You might be wondering why we used another way of loading the resource bundle   and why the full relative path to the bundle location was used. Well, if we want the  application to be runnable from the IntelliJ Interface, we have to provide a path relative  to the execution context of the application. When the application is built and packed in a  runnable Java archive, the resource files are part of it and in the classpath. But we run the  application by executing the main   method in an Java IDE, the classpath is relative to  the actual location of the project.  The following code snippet, restarts the scene by closing the Stage, then   instantiating a JavaFxDemo object and calling start .. . This means the whole  hierarchical node structure is re-created; the only state that is kept is the one that was  defined in static objects. This is needed for the locale setting, because the start ..   method execution now starts with a call to loadLocale locale , which selects the locale  of the application and loads the ResourceBundle so that, all nodes can be labeled with  texts returned by it.  449   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  primaryStage.close  ;             Platform.runLater    -> {                 try {                     new JavaFxDemo  .start new Stage   ;                 } catch  Exception e  {                     System.err.println "Could not reload application!" ;                 }             } ;  The application we have built until now and played with is a simple one. If you ever  need to build interfaces that are more complex and internationalization is needed, this  means more than translations are configured. You might need to have files with different  number and date formats, or multiple resource bundles. Internationalization is a big  topic and an important one, as rarely an application is built nowadays to be used in a  single region. But for a Java beginner, just knowing what the supporting classes are and  how they can be used is a very good starting point.   Build a Web Application Here we are. Things are getting serious. We are building a web application. A web  application is an application that runs on a server and can be accessed using a browser.  Until recently most Java applications needed web servers like Apache Tomcat, Glassfish,  or Enterprise, and servers like JBoss  currently known as WildFly  or TomEE to be hosted  on, so they could be accessed. You would write the web application, with the classes  and HTML or JSP files, pack it in a WAR  Web ARchive  or an EAR  Enterprise ARchive ,  deploy it to a server, and start the server. The server would provide the context of the  application and map requests to classes that would provide the answer to be served as  responses. Assuming the application would be deployed on a Tomcat server, Figure 10-12  shows an abstract schema of the deployed application functionality.  450   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Figure 10-12.  Web application deployed on an Apache Tomcat server  Requests to a web application can come from other clients than browsers, but   because this section covers web applications, we’ll assume all requests to our application  come from a browser. Let me explain the Internet a little first.  The Internet is an information system made up of a lot of computers linked together.   Some computers host application servers that provide access to applications, some  computers access these applications and some do both. The communication between  these computers is done over a network through a list of protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP,  POP, and so forth. The most popular protocol is HTTP, which stands for Hypertext  Transfer Protocol and it is an asymmetric request-response client-server protocol, this  means that the client makes a request to the server and then the server sends a response.  Subsequent requests have no knowledge of one another and they do not share any state,  thus they are stateless. HTTP requests can be of different types, being categorized by the  action they require the application on the server to perform, but there are four types that  are more commonly used by developers  the ones listed in Figure 10-12 in the request  arrow . I won’t go into the details of request components because it is not really related  to Java; I’ll cover enough information to understand how a web application works. The  following list contains the four most common request types and the responses a server  generates for them:  451   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive      GET: Whenever a user enters a URL in the browser  e.g., http:  my-  site.com index.html , the browser transforms the address into a  request message and sends it to the web server. What the browser  does can be easily viewed by opening the debugger view in Firefox.  Click the Network tab, and access www.google.com. Figure 10-13  shows the Firefox debugger view showing the URL being requested  and the contents of the Request message.  Figure 10-13.  Network debugger view in Firefox  In the right part of the image, you can see the URL being requested, the type of  request, also called a request method, which is GET in this case, and the remote  address of the server where the request was sent to. There is also a Raw headers  button that opens a view depicting the contents of the request and response as text.  GET requests are used to retrieve something from the server, in this example, a web  page. If the web page can be found, the response is sent with the page to be displayed  by the browser and other attributes, such a status code, to communicate that all went  fine. There is a list of HTTP status codes, the most important one is the 200 code,  which means all went OK. In Figure 10-13, you can see that to display the page a lot  of additional requests are done, after the initial request is replied, and all subsequent  requests are successful, because the status returned by the server is put in the first  column in the table and it’s always 200.  452   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive              PUT: This type of request is used when data is sent to the server for  storage. In enterprise applications, a PUT requests is interpreted as  a request to update an existing object, and the request contains the  updated version of the object and means to identify it.  POST: This type of request is used when the server needs to be  instructed to save data for storage as well. The difference from PUT  request is that this data does not exist on the server yet. In enterprise  applications a POST request is used to send credentials so the user  can be authenticated, or to send data that creates a new object. When  a POST request sends credentials the response status code is 200  when the user is authenticated and 401 Unauthorized  when the user  credentials are not good, when a POST request sends data to be saved,  the 201 status code is returned if the object was created.  DELETE: This type of request is used when the server is asked to  delete data. The response code is 200 when the deleting the data was  successful, and any other error code related to the cause why it did  not, otherwise.  There are a few other HTTP methods that are used in more complex applications.   If you are curious about request methods, status codes, and HTTP basics, I  confidently recommend the tutorial at www.ntu.edu.sg home ehchua programming  webprogramming http_basics.html. Now let’s get back to writing Java web applications.  Until a while ago, we needed a server to host a web application but this is no   longer the case. As databases were replaced for testing purposes and applications with  minimum functionality with embedded databases, the same happened to web servers.  If you want to quickly write a simple web application you have now the option of using  an embedded server, like Jetty or Tomcat  the embedded version . For this section of the  chapter, we’ll use an embedded Tomcat server and we’ll create a small web application  that displays a simple HTML page. The code is depicted in the next listing.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import org.apache.catalina.Context; import org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException; import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat;  import java.io.File;  453   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  public class WebDemo {     public static void main String... args  throws LifecycleException {         Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat  ;         tomcat.setBaseDir "chapter10 web-app out" ;         tomcat.setPort 8080 ;          String contextPath = " demo";         String docBase = new File "." .getAbsolutePath  ;          Context context = tomcat.addContext contextPath, docBase ;          SampleServlet servlet = new SampleServlet  ;         tomcat.addServlet contextPath, servlet.getServletName  , servlet ;         context.addServletMapping servlet.getUrlPattern  ,                  servlet.getServletName   ;          tomcat.start  ;         tomcat.getServer  .await  ;     } }  If you think it is simple, it really is. All we have to do to start an embedded server is   to create a Tomcat instance and select the port we want to expose it on in this case 8080   and specify a location for the Tomcat temp files. As we are running our main ..  method  from IntelliJ, the context of the application is relative to the project directory, so the  base directory for Tomcat is set as the out directory where IntelliJ IDEA stores compiled  classes and other temporary files for this project. A Java web application needs a context  path. The context path value is a part of the URL to access the application. An URL is  made up of four parts.          protocol: The application-level protocol used by client and server to  communicate,  e.g., http, https, ftp, etc. .  hostname: The DNS domain name  e.g., www.google.com  or IP  address  e.g., 192.168.0.255  or any alias recognized in a network. For  example when an application is accessed from the same computer  the server is installed on either 127.0.0.1 can be used or localhost.  454   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive          port: The TCP port number the server is listening for incoming  requests from clients. For web applications it usually is 8080, but  most URLs do not contain this port as there are routing mechanisms  in place to hide it.  path and filename: The name and location of the resource, under  the server document base directory. Users usually request to view  specific pages hosted on servers, which is why URLs look like this:  https:  docs.oracle.com index.html. But a very used practice is  to hide the paths and file names by using internal mappings  called  URL redirection  because of security reasons.  So where does the context path value come in? Well, when we have an embedded   server declared like in the previous code sample, any files that are hosted by it can  be accessed by using the http:  localhost:8080 , but because a server can host  more than one application, they must be a way to separate them, right? Here is where  the context path value comes in handy. Because by setting the context path to  demo,  the WebDemo application and the resources it provides to the users can be accessed at  http:  localhost:8080 demo .  Java Web Applications are dynamic, the pages are generated from Java code using  Servlets and JSP Java Server Pages  pages. Because of that, Java Web Applications are  not running on a server but inside a web container on the server. The web container  provides a Java runtime environment for Java Web applications. Apache Tomcat is  such a container running in the JVM; it supports execution of servlets and JSP pages. A  servlet is a Java class that is a subclass of javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet. Instances  of this type answer HTTP Requests within a web container. A JSP page is a file with  .jsp extension that contains HTML and Java code. A JSP page gets compiled into a  servlet by the web container the first time the page is accessed. In essence the servlet is  the core element of a Java Web application. Also, the server must know that the servlet  exists and how to identify it, this where the call tomcat.addServlet contextPath,  servlet.getServletName  , servlet ; comes in, it basically says: add the servlet  with name servlet.getServletName   to the application context with the contextPath  value context path. Then, to associate an URL pattern to the servlet, the  context. addServletMapping servlet.getUrlPattern  , servlet.getServletName   ; is  called.  455   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  When a Java Web Application is running, all its servlets and JSP are running into  its context, but they have to be added into the context in the code and mapped to an  URL pattern. The requests URL that match that URL pattern will access that servlet. In  the previous code sample, you can see that an instance of SampleServlet is created.  It is a custom class extending javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet that overrides the  doGet ..  method to return a response to the client for a GET request with http:   localhost:8080 demo . The code of this class is depicted next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter;  public class SampleServlet extends HttpServlet {      private final String servletName = "sampleServlet";     private final String urlPattern = " ";      @Override      protected void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response               throws IOException {         PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter  ;         try  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader            new FileReader "chapter10 web-app src main resources static index.  html"    {              String line = "";             while   line = reader.readLine    != null  {                 writer.println line ;             }         }     }  456   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive      @Override     public String getServletName   {         return servletName;     }      public String getUrlPattern   {    }         return urlPattern;  }  The urlPattern property was added to this class for practical reasons to keep   everything related to this servlet in one place. The same goes for servletName. If the  intention was to instantiate this class multiple times to create multiple servlets, these  two properties should be taken outside of it. Inside the doGet ..  method we only read  the contents of the index.html file and we write them in the response object using the  response PrintWriter.  As you can see, the doGet ..  method receives as arguments two objects: the  HttpServletRequest instance is read and all contents of the request sent from the  client can be accessed using appropriate methods, and the HttpServletResponse  instance, that is used to add information to the response. In the previous code sample,  we are just writing HTML code read from another file, but we can set the status also by  calling response.setStatus HttpServletResponse.SC_OK ; Aside from the doGet ..   method there are do* ..  methods matching each HTTP method that declare the same  type of parameters.  Another way to write the class  starting with Servlet 3.0  is depicted in the following   code snippet:  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter;  457   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  @WebServlet          name = "sampleServlet",         urlPatterns = {" "}   public class IndexServlet extends HttpServlet {      @Override      protected void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response               throws IOException {         PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter  ;         response.setStatus HttpServletResponse.SC_OK ;         try  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader         new FileReader "chapter10 web-app src main resources static index.  html"    {              String line = "";             while   line = reader.readLine    != null  {                 writer.println line ;             }         }         writer.flush  ;         writer.close  ;     } }  Using the @WebServlet annotation, we no longer need to have properties where we  store the servlet name and URL pattern, but the Tomcat context needs to be modified   a little to tell it to scan for classes annotated with @WebServlet. So, instantiating the  servlet explicitly is no longer necessary. Neither is calling tomcat.addServlet ..    and context.addServletMapping .. , because adding the servlet to the application  context and mapping it is done automatically using the information provided by the   @WebServlet annotation. But we do have to define where the compiled servlet classes  are by declaring an WebResourceSet instance and adding it to the context resources.  import org.apache.catalina.Context; import org.apache.catalina.WebResourceRoot; import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat;  458   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  import org.apache.catalina.webresources.DirResourceSet; import org.apache.catalina.webresources.StandardRoot;  import java.io.File;  public class WebDemo {      public static void main String... args  throws Exception {         Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat  ;         tomcat.setBaseDir "chapter10 web-app out" ;         tomcat.setPort 8080 ;          String contextPath = " demo";         String docBase = new File "." .getAbsolutePath  ;          Context context = tomcat.addContext contextPath, docBase ;           File webInfClasses = new File root.getAbsolutePath  , "production   classes" ;          WebResourceRoot resources = new StandardRoot context ;          WebResourceSet resourceSet;         if  webInfClasses.exists    {             resourceSet = new DirResourceSet resources,                 " WEB-INF classes", webInfClasses.getAbsolutePath  , " " ;             System.out.println "loading WEB-INF resources from as '"                + webInfClasses.getAbsolutePath   + "'" ;         } else {             resourceSet = new EmptyResourceSet resources ;         }         resources.addPreResources resourceSet ;         context.setResources resources ;          tomcat.start  ;         tomcat.getServer  .await  ;     } }  459   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  So this is how we handle servlets, but how do we handle JSP pages using an   embedded server? First we have to create a directory where the JSP pages are. So the  structure of our project must change as depicted in Figure 10-14.  Figure 10-14.  Web application structure change  460   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  As you can see, the resource dynamic directory was added to place the JSP pages in.    As our application is getting complicated it is time to clean it up a little and make paths  relative to the execution path of the application, which is the out directory. So, we  introduce the following class.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import java.io.File;  public class LocationUtility {      public static File getRootFolder   throws Exception {         String executionPath = WebDemo.class.getProtectionDomain                .getCodeSource  .getLocation  .toURI  .getPath  .  replaceAll "\\\\", " " ;          int lastIndexOf = executionPath.lastIndexOf " production " ;         return lastIndexOf < 0 ? new File ""  :               new File executionPath.substring 0, lastIndexOf  ;     } }  We now know that when IntelliJ IDEA compiles Gradle applications it creates  under the out directory a directory named production containing compiled Java  classes and resources, properly organized each in their own directory. So that is why,  the root directory of the execution of our application is computed relative to that  directory. As we’ve added an index.jsp page, we have to add a different URL pattern for  SampleServlet and since we also added relative paths, the class code changes a little.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter;  461   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  @WebServlet          name = "sampleServlet",         urlPatterns = {" sample"}   public class SampleServlet extends HttpServlet {      @Override      protected void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response               throws IOException {         PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter  ;         response.setStatus HttpServletResponse.SC_OK ;         try  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader                  new FileReader LocationUtility.getRootFolder                    + " production resources static index.html"    {             String line = "";             while   line = reader.readLine    != null  {                 writer.println line ;             }         } catch  Exception e  {             writer.println           "   Web Application Demo [ERROR]   " +           "  Something went wrong." +           "The page is not available. Error: " + e.getMessage             + "   " ;             e.printStackTrace  ;         }         writer.flush  ;         writer.close  ;     } }  And since we might get the path to index.html wrong, we made sure to display a  proper message in the page. Next is to create a JSP page. There are two ways of writing  JSP pages. JSP scriptlets are the simplest ones to use. They are pieces of Java code  embedded in HTML code using directive tags. There are three type of directive tags.  462               Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive    directive used to provide instructions to the  container. Instructions declared using this directive belong to the  current page and can be used anywhere in the page. Such a directive  can import Java types or define page properties; for example,    <%@ page language="java" contentType="text html; charset=US-ASCII"       pageEncoding="US-ASCII" %>    directive includes a file during translation  phase. Thus the current JSP file where this directive is used, is a  composition of its content and the content of the file that is declared  using this directive.       directive declares a tag library with elements  that are used in the JSP page. This directive is important because it  imports a library with custom tags and element that writes the JSP  page. These tags provide dynamic functionality without the need for  scriptlets.  The index.jsp page that we are using in this application is quite simple.    <%@ page language="java" contentType="text html; charset=US-ASCII"      pageEncoding="US-ASCII" %> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"     "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">              Web Application Demo JSP Page                        Today is                   The page displays today’s date, and this is done by calling new Date  . We are using  Java code in what it looks like an HTML page. Because those directives are in there at the  463   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  top of the page and the extension is .jsp, the container knows this file must be compiled  into a servlet. The default page a web application opens with when its root domain is  accessed, if nothing was mapped to the default URL pattern " " is a file named index. html or index.htm or index.jsp in this case. So, aside from adding the file named  index.jsp in the proper directory and then making sure the container can find the  said application directory, there is nothing more to do so that when we access http:   localhost:8080 demo  our page is displayed.  So let’s see how the WebDemo class changes to make sure the index.jsp file is found   and displayed properly.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import org.apache.catalina.WebResourceRoot; import org.apache.catalina.WebResourceSet; import org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext; import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat; import org.apache.catalina.webresources.DirResourceSet; import org.apache.catalina.webresources.EmptyResourceSet; import org.apache.catalina.webresources.StandardRoot;  import java.io.File; import java.nio.file.Files; import static com.apress.bgn.ch10.LocationUtility.getRootFolder;  public class WebDemo {     public static void main String... args  throws Exception {         File root = getRootFolder  ;         Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat  ;         tomcat.setPort 8080 ;         tomcat.setBaseDir root.getAbsolutePath   ;          File webAppFolder = new File root.getAbsolutePath  ,                 "production resources dynamic" ;         if  !webAppFolder.exists    {             System.err.println "Could not find JSP pages directory!" ;         }         StandardContext context =  StandardContext  tomcat.                    addWebapp " demo", webAppFolder.getAbsolutePath   ;  464   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive          context.setParentClassLoader WebDemo.class.getClassLoader   ;           File webInfClasses = new File root.getAbsolutePath  , "production   classes" ;          WebResourceRoot resources = new StandardRoot context ;          WebResourceSet resourceSet;         if  webInfClasses.exists    {             resourceSet = new DirResourceSet resources, " WEB-INF classes",                 webInfClasses.getAbsolutePath  , " " ;         } else {             resourceSet = new EmptyResourceSet resources ;         }         resources.addPreResources resourceSet ;         context.setResources resources ;          tomcat.start  ;         tomcat.getServer  .await  ;     } }  should see a simple message like the following.  Today is Mon Aug 20 01:41:29 BST 2018  Of course, the date is the one on your system.  So now when we open http:  localhost:8080 demo  URL in the browser, you   ?  as an exercise for you, imagine how the Java servlet class would look like if  you had to write it.  Since taglibs were mentioned, let’s talk a little about them. The most basic tag library  is the JSTL, which stands for JSP Standard Tag Library. Other more evolved tag libraries  are provided by JSF  JavaServerFaces , Thymeleaf, or Spring. Tags defined in this library  can be used to write JSP pages that change behavior. Depending on request attributes,  they can be used to iterate, to test values, and for internationalization and formatting.   465   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive  Based on the JSTL functions provided, the tags are grouped into five categories. They  can be used in a JSP page only after specifying the appropriate directives. Next, the five  directives are listed with the overall topic the tags cover.                      <%@ taglib uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl core"  prefix="c" %> JSTL Core tags provide support for displaying values,  iteration, conditional logic, catch exceptions, URL, and forward or  redirect response.  <%@ taglib uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl fmt"  prefix="fmt" %> JSTL Formatting tags are provided for formatting  of numbers, dates, and i18n support through locales and resource  bundles.  <%@ taglib uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl sql"  prefix="sql" %> JSTL SQL tags provide support for interaction with  relational databases, but never do this, never use SQL in a web page  because it is very easily hackable  look up SQL Injection on Google .  <%@ taglib uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl xml" prefix="x"  %> JSTL XML tags provide support for handling XML documents,  parsing, transformations and XPath expressions evaluation.  <%@ taglib uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl functions"  prefix="fn" %> JSTL Function tags provide a number of functions  that can be used to perform common operations such as text  manipulations.  Now that we know the basic tag categories, which ones do you think we need to use  to redesign our index.jsp page? If you thought about FMT and Core, you are right. Also,  JSP pages that use taglibs are always backed up by a servlet that sets the proper attributes  on the request that is used within the JSP page. So, let’s modify the index.jsp page, as  depicted next.  <%@ page language="java" contentType="text html;       charset=US-ASCII" pageEncoding="US-ASCII"%>     <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"    "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">  466   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive                        Web Application Demo JSP Page                                       <fmt:formatDate value="${requestScope.today}"                         pattern="dd MM yyyy" var="todayFormatted" >           Today is                    And while we are at it, let’s rename it to make it obvious what it is used for, let’s call  it date.jsp and write a servlet class named DateServlet to add the today attribute to  the request, which is formatted by the   tag. The result is saved into the  todayFormatted variable, which is later printed by the   tag.  package com.apress.bgn.ch10;  import javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import java.io.IOException;  import java.util.Date;  @WebServlet          name = "dateServlet",         urlPatterns = {" "}   public class DateServlet extends HttpServlet {  467   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive      @Override      protected void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response               throws IOException, ServletException {         System.out.println " ->>> Getting date " ;         request.setAttribute "today", new Date   ;          RequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext  .getRequestDispatcher    " date.jsp" ;          rd.forward request, response ;     } }  This is all. Now, we restart the application and the first page now displays: "Today   is 20 08 2018", You will obviously see the date on your system when the code is run on  your machine.  If you think writing Java Web applications is cumbersome you are right. Pure Java   is tedious for such a task. Professional Java Web applications are usually written by  using frameworks that make the job of creating pages and linking them to the backend  easily. Even more, nowadays the tendency is to create interfaces in JavaScript also using  advanced CSS4, now many UI Designs can also be done 100% in CSS3 or CSS4  and  communicate to a Java backend application hosted on an enterprise server using Web  Service calls, usually REST. Anyway, look it up if you are curious, the subject is vast, but  frameworks such as Spring make it easy to set up your environment and start developing.   Summary This chapter covered important development tools and techniques, the classes in JDK  that provide support, and important Java libraries that could make your development job  more practical and pleasant. The JDK has never shined when it comes to GUI support,  but JavaFX is an evolution from AWT and Swing, and it just might have a future. The  following is a complete list of the topics.     how to write an interactive console application     how to write an interactive application with a Swing interface      the basics of JavaFX architecture  468   Chapter 10    Making Your appliCation interaCtive     how to write an interactive application with a JavaFX interface     how to internationalize your application     how to write a web application using an embedded server     what a servlet is     what a JSP scriptlet is     how to use taglibs to write JSP pages  469   CHAPTER 11  Working with Files  One of the most important functions in software is information organizing and storage,  with the goal of using it and sharing it. Before computers were invented information  was written on paper and stored in organized cabinets where it could be retrieved  from manually. Software applications that run on computers do something similar.  Information is written in files, files are organized in directories and in even more  complex structures named databases. Java provides classes to read information from  files and databases and classes to write files and write information to databases. In  Chapter 9, a simple example using a Derby in-memory database was introduced to  show you how heavy dependencies like databases can be mocked to allow faster unit  testing. This chapter is not focused on using Java to perform database operations, but on  how Java can be used to manipulate files.   File Handlers Before showing you how to read or write files, I need to show you how to access them  from the code, to check if they exist, to check their size and list their properties, and so  forth. Enough with the literature—let’s get cracking!  When working with files in Java, the most important class is the java.io.File class.  This class is an abstract representation of a file and directory pathname. Instances of this  class are called file handlers because they allow developers to handle files and directories  in the Java code using references of this type, instead of complete pathnames. A File  instance can be created by using different arguments.  The simplest way is to use the constructor that receives as an argument a String   value containing the absolute file pathname. In the following code sample, the  printStats ..  method prints file information. We use it a lot in this section, but the  code won’t be depicted again.    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_11  471   Chapter 11    Working With Files  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.File;  public class Demo {     private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger Demo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {     File file = new File " Users iulianacosmina apress vultures.txt" ;     printFileStats file ;     }      private static void printFileStats File f  { if  f.exists    {     log.info "File Details:" ;     log.info "Type : {}", f.isFile   ? "file" : "directory or symlink" ;     log.info "Location :{}", f.getAbsolutePath   ;     log.info "Parent :{}", f.getParent   ;     log.info "Name : {}", f.getName   ;      double kilobytes = f.length     1024; log.info "Size : {} ", kilobytes ;      log.info "Is Hidden : {}", f.isHidden   ;     log.info "Is Readable? : {}", f.canRead   ;     log.info "Is Writable? : {}", f.canWrite   ;     }     } }  In the previous code snippet, the file handler instance is created by providing the   absolute file pathname on my computer. If you want to run the code on your computer,  you must provide a pathname to a file on your computer. If you are using Windows, keep  in mind that the pathname contains the "\" character that is a special character in Java  and must be escaped by doubling it.  The printStats ..  method makes use of a lot of methods that can be called on a  file handler. The full list of methods that you can call is bigger. This list is in the official   472   API documentation  https:  docs.oracle.com javase 10 docs api java io File. html. All the file handler methods are explained in the following list at: https:  docs. oracle.com javase 10 docs api java io File.html.  Chapter 11    Working With Files      isFile   returns true if the pathname points to a file and false if  the pathname points to a directory or a symlink  a special type of file  with the purpose to link to another file, can be useful when you want  to shorten the pathname to a file and incredibly useful on Windows  where the pathname length limit is of 256 characters . In the previous  code sample, the method returns true, and the log prints:  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Type : file  If we want to see if the method works for a directory, we delete the  file name from the pathname.  File file = new File " Users iulianacosmina apress" ;  And then the log prints:  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Type : directory or  symlink      getAbsolutePath   returns the absolute pathname to a file or a  directory. When creating a file handler, the absolute pathname is not  always needed, but in case you need to use it later, or to make sure  the relative path was resolved correctly, this method is just what you  need. The following piece of code creates a file handler to a file in  the resources directory by using the path relative to the root project  directory  in our case, the java-for-absolute-beginners directory .  File d = new File "chapter11 read-write-file src main  resources input " ;  And now the getAbsolutePath   method prints the full pathname.  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Location : Users  iulianacosmina   java-for-absolute-beginners chapter11 read-write- file src main resources input vultures.txt  473   Chapter 11    Working With Files  The Java File class is quite powerful; it can also be used to point to  a shared file on another computer. There is a special constructor for  this which receives an argument of type java.net.URI, where URI  stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. To test this constructor, select  a file on your computer, and open it in a browser, so you can get its  URI from the browser address bar.  try {     URI uri = new URI "file:   Users iulianacosmina    java-for-absolute-beginners chapter11 "      + "read-write-file src main resources input vultures.  txt" ; f = new File uri ;     printFileStats f ; } catch  URISyntaxException use  {    log.error "Malformed URI, no file there", use ; }  Because the URI might have an incorrect prefix or not exactly  pointing to a file the URI constructor is declared to throw an   java.net.URISyntaxException, which is why in the code, you must  handle this as well. If an URI is used to create a file handler, the  getAbsolutePath   method returns the absolute pathname of   the file, on the computer and drive where the file is.              getParent   returns the absolute path to the directory containing the  file, because hierarchically, a file cannot have another file as a parent.  getName   returns the file name. The file name contains the extension  as the suffix after "." is called, indicates the type of file and what is  intended to be used for.  length   returns the length of the file in bytes. This method does  not work for directories, as directories can contain files restricted to  the user executing the program and exceptions might be thrown. So,  if you ever need the size of a directory, you have to write the code  yourself.  474   Chapter 11    Working With Files      isHidden   returns true if the file is not visible to the current  user; otherwise, it returns else. On a macOS Linux system, files  with names starting with "." are hidden, so if we want to see that  method returning true we must create a handler to one of the  system configuration files, such as .bash_profile. So, calling the  printStats ..  on a file handler created using a pathname to a  hidden file results in an output similar to this:  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - File Details:  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Type : file [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Location : Users  iulianacosmina .viminfo [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11. Demo - Parent : Users iulianacosmina [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Name : .viminfo  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Size : 13.0 [main]  INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Is Hidden : true [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Is Readable? : true  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.Demo - Is Writable? : true      canRead   and canWrite   can secure files from normal users. Both  methods return true when the use has the specific right on the file,  and are false otherwise.  File handlers can be created for pathnames pointing to directories, which means   there are available methods to call that are specific only to directories. The most  common thing to do with a directory is to list its contents. The list   method returns a  String array, containing the names of the files  and directories  under this directory.   We can use a lambda expression to print the entries in the array.  Arrays.stream d.list   .forEach ff -> log.info "\t File Name : {}", ff  ;  But files names are not really useful in most cases, having a File array with file  handlers to each of them would be better. That is why the listFiles   method was  added in version 1.2.  Arrays.stream d.listFiles   .forEach ff ->      log.info "\t File Name : {}", ff.getName    ;  475   Chapter 11    Working With Files  And this method has more than one form, because it filters the files and returns file  handlers only for files matching a certain requirement when called with an instance of  FileFilter.  Arrays.stream d.listFiles new FileFilter   {     @Override     public boolean accept File pathname  {     return pathname.getAbsolutePath  .endsWith "yml"           pathname.getAbsolutePath  .endsWith "properties" ;     } }  .forEach ff -> log.info "\t YML Properties file : {}", ff.getName    ;  The previous code sample is written in expanded form to make it clear that you   should provide a concrete implementation for the accept ..  method. Using lambda  expressions, the code can be simplified and made less prone to exceptions being thrown.  Arrays.stream Objects.requireNonNull       d.listFiles pathname -> pathname.getAbsolutePath        .endsWith "yml"   pathname.getAbsolutePath  .endsWith "properties"          .forEach ff -> log.info "\t YML Properties file : {}", ff.getName    ;  In the previous example, we implemented the accept ..  to filter by extension,   but the filter can involve anything really. But, when the filter you need strictly involves  the file name, you can reduce the boilerplate by using the other version of the method,  which receives a FilenameFilter instance as argument.  Arrays.stream d.listFiles new FilenameFilter   {       @Override       public boolean accept File dir, String name  {      return name.contains "son" ;       } }  .forEach ff -> log.info "\t Namesakes : {}", ff.getName    ;  Aside from listing properties of a file, a file handler can also be used to create a file.   To create a file, the createNewFile   method must be called after creating a file handler  with a specific pathname.  476   Chapter 11    Working With Files  File created = new File     "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output created.txt" ; if  !created.exists    {     try {      created.createNewFile  ;     } catch  IOException e  {     log.error "Could not create file.", e ;     } }  The exists   method returns true when the file hander is associated with a file, and  false otherwise. It tests if the file we are trying to create is already there. If the file exists,  the method has no effect. If the user does not have proper rights to create the file at the  specified pathname, a SecurityException is thrown. In certain cases, we might need to  create a file that needs only to be used during the execution of the program. This means  we either have to create the file and delete it explicitly, or we can create a temporary  file. Temporary files are created by calling createTempFile prefix, suffix  and they  are created in the temporary directory defined for the operating system. The prefix  argument is of type String and the created file has the name starting with its value. The  suffix argument is of type String as well and it specifies an extension for the file. The  rest of the file name is generated by the operating system.  try {     File temp = File.createTempFile "java_bgn_", ".tmp" ;     log.info "File created.txt at: {}", temp.getAbsolutePath   ;     temp.deleteOnExit  ; } catch  IOException e  {     log.error "Could not create temporary file.", e ; }  Files in the temporary directory of an operating system are periodically deleted  by the operating system, but if you want to make sure it is deleted, you can explicitly  call deleteOnExit   on the file handler for the temporary file. In the code sample, the  absolute path to the file is printed to show the exact location where the temporary file  was created and on a macOS system the full pathname looks very similar to this:   var folders gg nm_cb2lx72q1lz7xwwdh7tnc0000gn T java_ bgn_14652264510049064218.tmp  477   Chapter 11    Working With Files  A file can also be renamed using a Java file handler, there is a method for that   called rename f  that is called with a file handler argument, pointing to the location  and desired name that the file should have. The method returns true if the renaming  succeeded and false otherwise.  File file = new File      "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output sample created.txt" ;   File renamed = new File       "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output sample renamed.txt" ; boolean result = file.renameTo renamed ; log.info "Renaming succeeded? : {} ", result ;  Most methods in the File class throw IOException when things do not go as   expected, because manipulating a file can fail because of a hardware problem, or an  operating system problem. Methods that require special rights for accessing a file throw  a SecurityException when things do not go as expected.  So, when writing Java applications that need to manipulate files, you must handle   those as well. And now that the bases for working with file handlers have been covered, it  is time for the next section.   Path Handlers The java.nio.file.Path interface was introduced in Java 1.7 with the java.nio.file. Files and java.nio.file.Paths utility classes to provide new and more practical   ways to work with files. They are part of the java.nio package; the word nio means   non- blocking input output. A Path instance may be used to locate a file in a file system,  thus represents a system dependent file path. Path instances are more practical than  File because they can provide methods to access components of a path, to combine  paths, and to compare paths.  Path instances cannot be directly created, because an interface cannot be   instantiated, but the interface provides static utility methods to create them, and so does  the class Paths. The simplest way to create a Path instance is to start with a file handler  and call Paths.get fileURI .  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; 478   Chapter 11    Working With Files  import java.io.File; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.nio.file.Paths; import java.util.Iterator;  public class PathDemo {     private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger PathDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {     File file = new File          "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.txt" ;     Path path = Paths.get file.toURI   ;     log.info path.toString   ;     } }  Starting with Java 11, Paths.get file.toURI    can be replaced with Path.  of file.toURI   .  The other way to create a Path instance is to use the other form of the Paths.get ..    which receives as arguments, multiple pieces of the path.  Path composedPath = Paths.get " Users iulianacosmina apress workspace",      "java-for-absolute-beginners chapter11 read-write-file src main   resources input",     "vultures.txt" ; log.info composedPath.toString   ;  Both paths point to the same location, thus if compared with each other using the   compareTo ..  method  because Path extends interface Comparable  , the result  returned is 0  zero , which means the paths are equal.  log.info "Is the same path? : {} ", path.compareTo composedPath  ==0 ?  "yes" : "no" ;     prints : INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.PathDemo - Is the same path? : yes  In the next code sample, a few Paths methods are called on the path instance.  log.info "Location :{}", path.toAbsolutePath   ; log.info "Is Absolute? : {}", path.isAbsolute   ; log.info "Parent :{}", path.getParent   ;  479   Chapter 11    Working With Files  log.info "Root :{}", path.getRoot   ; log.info "FileName : {}", path.getFileName   ; log.info "FileSystem : {}", path.getFileSystem   ;  The list explains each method and its outcome:                      toAbsolutePath   returns a Path instance representing the absolute  path of this path. When called on the path instance created, as it is  already absolute, the method returns the path object the method is  called on. Also, calling path.isAbsolute  returns true.  getParent   returns the parent Path instance. So, calling this  method on the path instance prints  INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.PathDemo - Parent : Users  iulianacosmina apress workspace java-for-absolute-beginners  chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input  getRoot   returns the root component of this path as a Path  instance. On a Linux or macOS system it prints " ", on Windows,  something like "C:\".  getFileName   returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this  path as a Path instance, basically, the path is split by the system path  separator, and the most far away from the root element is returned.  getFileSystem   returns the file system that created this object, for  macOS it is an instance of type  sun.nio.fs.MacOSXFileSystem  Another useful Path method is resolve ..  This method takes a String instance   that is a representation of a path and resolves it against the Path instance it is called  on. This means that path separators are added according to the operating system the  program runs on and a Path instance is returned.  Path chapterPath = Paths.get " Users iulianacosmina apress workspace",      "java-for-absolute-beginners chapter11" ; Path filePath = chapterPath.resolve      "read-write-file src main resources input vultures.txt" ; log.info "Resolved Path :{}", filePath.toAbsolutePath   ;  480   Chapter 11    Working With Files  The sample code prints the following:  INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.PathDemo - Resolved Path : : Users iulianacosmina  apress  workspace java-for-absolute-beginners chapter11 read-write-file  src main resources input vultures.txt  Using Path instances, writing code that manages files, or retrieves their properties   becomes easier to write in combination with Files utility methods. The following code  sample makes use of a few of these methods to print properties of a file, in the same way  we did using a File handler.  Path outputPath = FileSystems.getDefault       .getPath " Users iulianacosmina apress workspace " +      "java-for-absolute-beginners chapter11 read-write-file src main   resources output sample2" ;  try {     Files.createDirectory outputPath ;     log.info "Type: {}", Files.isDirectory outputPath  ? "yes" : "no" ;      Path destPath = Paths.get outputPath.toAbsolutePath  .toString  ,      "vultures.txt" ;     Files.copy path, destPath ;     double kilobytes = Files.size destPath     double 1024;     log.info "Size : {} ", kilobytes ;     Path newFilePath = Paths.get outputPath.toAbsolutePath  .toString  ,     "vultures2.txt" ;     Files.createFile newFilePath ;     log.info "Type: {}", Files.isRegularFile newFilePath  ? "yes" : "no" ;     log.info "Type: {}", Files.isSymbolicLink newFilePath  ? "yes" : "no" ;      log.info "Is Hidden: {}", Files.isHidden newFilePath  ? "yes" : "no" ;     log.info "Is Readable: {}", Files.isReadable newFilePath  ? "yes" : "no" ;     log.info "Is Writable: {}", Files.isWritable newFilePath  ? "yes" : "no" ;       Path copyFilePath = Paths.get " Users iulianacosmina temp ",   "vultures3.txt" ;      Files.move newFilePath, copyFilePath ;     log.info "Exists? : {}", Files.exists copyFilePath ? "yes": "no" ;     log.info "File moved to: {}", copyFilePath.toAbsolutePath   ;  481   Chapter 11    Working With Files      Files.deleteIfExists copyFilePath ; } catch  FileAlreadyExistsException e  {     log.error "Creation failed!", e ; } catch  IOException e  {     log.error "Something unexpected happened!", e ; }  As you can see, the Files class provides a lot more functionality when working with   files. Also, more specialized exceptions  types that extend IOException  are thrown  depending on the operation, so the failure is obvious. For example,  createFile ...  throws a java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException   if the file already exists, it does not return a Path instance associated with it.  createDirectory ..  has the same behavior and so does move .. .  The delete ..  method that is not used here throws a java.nio.file.  NoSuchFileException if the file to be deleted does not exist. To avoid an exception being  thrown in the code sample, deleteIfExists ..  was used.  And the list of methods is even bigger, but since the size of this chapter is limited,  you can check it out yourself on the official Javadoc API at https:  docs.oracle.com  javase 10 docs api java nio file Files.html.   Reading Files Files are a succession of bits on a hard drive. A File handler does not provide methods  to read the content of a file, but a group of other classes can be used to do so. Depending  on what is needed to be done with the contents of a file, there is more than one way to  read file contents in Java. Actually, there are a lot of ways and this section covers the most  common.   Using Scanner to Read Files The Scanner class was used to read input from the command line, but System.in can be  replaced with File and Scanner methods to read the file contents.  482   Chapter 11    Working With Files  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.Scanner;  public class ReadingFilesDemo {     private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger ReadingFilesDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File file = new File               "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.txt" ;         String content = "";         Scanner scanner;         try {             scanner = new Scanner file ;             while  scanner.hasNextLine    {                 content += scanner.nextLine   + "\n";             }             scanner.close  ;             log.info "Read with Scanner--> {}", content ;             scanner.close  ;     } catch  IOException e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;     }   } }  A Path instance can be used instead.  scanner = new Scanner Paths.get file.toURI   , StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name   ;  483    Working With Files  Chapter 11   Using Files Utility Methods to Read Files Another way to read a file, when its size can be approximated and thus it would not be a  problem storing its contents into a String object  there is enough memory  is to use the  appropriate method of the Files class.  try {     content = new String Files.readAllBytes Paths.get file.toURI     ;     log.info "Read with Files.readAllBytes --> {}", content ; } catch  IOException e  {     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  The advantage of using Files.readAllBytes ..  is that no loop is needed and we   do not have to construct the String value line by line, because this method reads all  the bytes in the files that can be given as an argument to the String constructor. The  disadvantage is that no Charset is used, so the text value might not be the one we expect.  But there is a way to overcome this; by calling Files.readAllLines .. . It returns the  file content as a list of String values, and has two forms, one of them declaring a Charset  as a parameter.  try {     List  lyricList = Files.readAllLines Paths.get file.toURI   ,        StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ;     lyricList.forEach System.out::println ; } catch  IOException e  {     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  But what if we do not need a List , but the one String instance? Well, in   Java 11 there’s a method for that and is called readString.  try {      content = Files.readString Paths.get file.toURI   , StandardCharsets.UTF_8      log.info "Read with Files.readAllBytes --> {}", content ; } catch  IOException e  {     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  484   Chapter 11    Working With Files   Using Readers to Read Files Before the fancy methods in the Files class, there were other ways, and you might  find yourself in the position of using them, when you are not really interested saving  everything you read from a file. Let’s start with a contraption code that you would write  up to Java 1.6 to read a file line by line.  import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.File; import java.io.FileReader; ...  BufferedReader reader = null; try {     reader = new BufferedReader new FileReader       new File "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.  txt"   ;      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ;     String line;     while   line = reader.readLine    != null  {        if !line.contains "Ooh"   {         sb.append line .append "\n" ;        }     }        log.info "Read with BufferedReader --> {}", sb.toString    ;     } catch  Exception e  {         log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;     } finally {        if reader != null  {          try {             reader.close  ;          } catch  IOException e1  {              e1.printStackTrace  ;          }     } }  485   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Whoa, what is that, right? Before Java 1.7 if you wanted to read a file line by line, this  is the code you had to write. You had to create a File handler. Then you needed to wrap  the file handler into a FileReader. This type of instance could do the job of reading, but  only in chunks of char[], which is not very useful when you need the actual text. So,  this instance needs to be wrapped into an instance of BufferedReader that provides this  functionality by reading the characters in an internal buffer. So, the way it works, reader. readLine   is called until there is nothing more to read—the end of the file was reached  and them we need to call reader.close  ; otherwise, a lock might be kept on the file  and it becomes unreadable until a restart.  In Java 1.7, a lot of things made to reduce the boilerplate needed to manage files and   file contents were introduced. One of those things was that all classes used to access  file contents and that could keep a lock on the file were enriched by being declared to  implement the java.io.Closeable interface that marked resources of these types as  closable, and a close   method is invoked to release resources transparently by the JVM  before execution ends. Also, in Java 7, try-with-resources was introduced. Making use of  all these features, the code can be written like this:  import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.File; import java.io.FileReader; ...  try  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader new FileReader         new File "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input   vultures.txt"    {      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ;      String line;      while   line = reader.readLine    != null  {         if !line.contains "Ooh"   {             sb.append line .append "\n" ;              }      }      log.info "Read with BufferedReader --> {}", sb.toString    ; } catch  Exception e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  486   Still we have that ugly constructor within constructor thing that is quite ugly. Well,   Java 8 comes to the rescue by introducing the Files.newBufferedReader Path  method.  So, the previous code becomes:  Chapter 11    Working With Files  import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.File; import java.io.FileReader; ... File file = new File     "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.txt" ; Path sourceFile = Paths.get file.toURI   ; try  BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader sourceFile  {     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ;      String line;      while   line = reader.readLine    != null  {         if !line.contains "Ooh"   {             sb.append line .append "\n" ;              }     }     log.info "Read with BufferedReader --> {}", sb.toString    ; } catch  Exception e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  But still, by using a combination of lambda expressions, we could get a similar   behavior when reading the file line by line:   List  lyricList = Files.readAllLines Paths.get file.toURI   ,       StandardCharsets.UTF_8        .stream         .filter line -> !line.contains "Ooh"         .collect Collectors.toList   ;  487   Chapter 11    Working With Files  All we would have to do is traverse the lines and add everything to a StringBuilder   and voila!, same result, less boilerplate. Or we can write it this way, using the   Files.lines ..  introduced in Java 1.8 and get all contents as a stream:  Stream  lyricStream = Files.lines file.toPath        .filter s -> !s.contains "Ooh"  ;     lyricStream.forEach System.out::println ;  The BufferedReader class is a member of a class group that extends the Reader class.   It is an abstract class used for reading characters streams. The full hierarchy is depicted  in Figure 11-1.  Figure 11-1.  Reader class hierarchy  Character streams can have different sources, files being the most common. They   provide sequential access to data stored in the file. The BufferedReader does not provide  support for character encoding, but a BufferedReader can be based on another Reader  instance, and the one that provides reading character streams and taking encoding into  account is InputStreamReader. So, we can replace  try  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader new FileReader     new File "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.  txt"    {        ... }  488   Chapter 11    Working With Files  with  import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.io.FileInputStream; ... try  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader new InputStreamReader    new FileInputStream       "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.txt" ,        StandardCharsets.UTF_8   {       ... }  But starting with Java 1.7, we don’t have to do that anymore because there is a   version of the Files.newBufferedReader that accepts a Charset instance as argument as  well. So, the code can be safely replaces with the following.  try  BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader sourceFile,     StandardCharsets.UTF_8  {       ... }  In Java 11, the Reader was enriched with the nullReader   method, which returns   a Reader instance that does nothing. This was requested by developers for testing  purposes.   Using InputStream to Read Files Classes in the Reader family are advanced classes for reading data as text. Files are a  sequence of bytes, so classes are wrappers around classes in a family of classes used  for reading byte streams. This becomes clear when trying to use the proper character  encoding when reading text using the BufferedReader, as the InputStreamReader  instance given as argument is based on a java.io.FileInputStream instance, a type  that is a subclass of java.io.InputStream.  The root class of this hierarchy is java.io.InputStream, which is depicted in   Figure 11-2.  489   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Figure 11-2.  InputStream class hierarchy  The BufferedInputStream class is equivalent to BufferedReader for reading streams   of bytes. The System.in that we used to read user data from the console is of this type,  and the Scanner instance converts the bytes from its buffer into user understandable  data. When the data we are interested in is not text that was stored using Unicode  conventions, but raw numeric data  binary files such as images, media files, PDF’s, etc.   classes for using streams of bytes are more suitable. Just for the purpose of showing you  how it’s done, we’ll read the contents of the vultures.txt file using FileInputStream.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.reading;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.File; import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.io.IOException; public class FileInputStreamReadingDemo {     private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger FileInputStreamReadingDemo.class ;  490       public static void main String... args  {         File file = new File              "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input vultures.txt" ;  Chapter 11    Working With Files          try {             FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream file ;             byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];             StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ;             while  fis.read buffer  != -1  {                 sb.append new String buffer  ;                 buffer = new byte[1024];             }             fis.close  ;              log.info "Read with FileInputStream --> {}", sb.toString    ;         } catch  IOException e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         }     } }  If you run the code, you notice that the expected output is printed in the console; but   after the text is printed a set of strange characters are printed too. On a macOS system,  they look like what’s shown in Figure 11-3.  Figure 11-3.  Text read with FileInputStream  491   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Do you have any idea what those characters might be? It’s ok if you have no idea, I did not either the first time I had to use FileInputStream   to read a file. Those characters appear there because the file size is not a multiple of  1024, so the FileInputReader ends up filling the rest of the last buffer with zeroes. A fix  for this involves computing the size of the file in bytes and making sure we adapt the  byte[] buffer size accordingly. You can try doing that as an exercise if you are in the  mood for some coding. And now that we’ve shown you how to read file in a lot of ways,  we can continue by showing you how to write files, since you already know how to create  them.  In Java 11, the InputStream was also enriched with a method that returns an  InputStream that does nothing named nullInputStream   method, for testing  purposes.   Writing Files Writing files in Java is similar to reading them, only different classes have to be used  because streams are unidirectional, which means that a stream that is used for reading  data cannot be used for writing data as well. Almost for any class or method of reading  files there is one for writing files. Without further ado, let’s start.   Writing Files Using Files Utility Methods For smaller files, when we just need to write a bunch of bytes, the Files.write Path,  byte[]  works fine.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.writing;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Path;  492   Chapter 11    Working With Files  public class FilesWritingDemo {     private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger FilesWritingDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File file = new File               "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output    vultures.txt" ;          byte[] data = "Some of us, we're hardly ever here".getBytes  ;         try {             Path dataPath = Files.write file.toPath  , data ;             log.info "String written to {}", dataPath.toAbsolutePath   ;         } catch  IOException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } }  If the file already exists, the contents are simply overwritten. In Java 11, the Files.writeString ..  method was introduced, which allows   specifying a Charset when writing a String instance to a file; no conversion to bytes  needed either.  try {     Path dataPath = Files.writeString file.toPath  ,         "Some of us, we're hardly ever here",         StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ;     log.info "String written to {}", dataPath.toAbsolutePath   ; } catch  IOException e  {     e.printStackTrace  ; }  There are three Files.write ..  methods in the Files class: the one used in the  previous code snippet and two that can write collections of text values represented by  any instance of type that extends CharSequence. The only difference between the two is  that one of them also takes Charset as an argument.  493   Chapter 11    Working With Files  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.writing;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.File; import java.io.IOException; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Path; import java.util.List;  public class FilesWritingDemo {     private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger FilesWritingDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {           List  dataList =  List.of "Some of us, we're hardly ever here",                 "The rest of us, we're born to disappear",                 "How do I stop myself from",                 "Being just a number?" ;         try {             File file2 = new File                 "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output   vultures2.txt" ;              Path dataPath = Files.write file2.toPath  ,  dataList,                StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ;             log.info "String written to {}", dataPath.toAbsolutePath   ;         } catch  IOException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } }  And those are all the methods in the Files class that are used for writing files   available in the Files class. Next, we look into writing files using classes in the Writer  hierarchy.  494   Chapter 11    Working With Files   Using Writers to Write Files Similar to the Reader hierarchy for reading files, there is an abstract class named Writer,  but before we get to that let’s introduce the BufferedWriter, the correspondent of  BufferedReader for writing files. This class too has an internal buffer, and when write  methods are called, the arguments are stored into the buffer, and when the buffer is  full, its contents are written to the file. The buffer can be emptied earlier by calling the  flush   method. I definitely recommend calling this method explicitly before calling  close   to make sure all output was written to the file. The next code snippet depicts  how a list of String instances is written to a file.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.writing;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.BufferedWriter; import java.io.File; import java.io.FileWriter; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.List;  public class FilesWritingDemo {     private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger FilesWritingDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {          File file = new File              "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output vultures.txt" ;          List  lyricList =  List.of "Some of us, we're hardly ever   here",                  "The rest of us, we're born to disappear",                 "How do I stop myself from",                 "Being just a number?" ;         BufferedWriter writer = null;  495   Chapter 11    Working With Files          try {              writer = new BufferedWriter new FileWriter file  ;              for  String lyric : lyricList  {                  writer.write lyric ;                  writer.newLine  ;              }         } catch  IOException e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         } finally {             if writer!= null  {                 try {                     writer.flush  ;                     writer.close  ;                 } catch  IOException e  {                     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;                 }             }         }     } }  Writing files is a sensitive operation, and the code contraption introduced earlier can   fail for many reasons. That type of code is what you would write before Java 1.7, when  try-with- resources reduced the boilerplate.  try  final BufferedWriter wr = new BufferedWriter new FileWriter file   {     lyricList.forEach lyric -> {      try {           wr.write lyric ;        log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;wr.newLine  ;        } catch  IOException e  {           log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;        }     } ;      wr.flush  ;  496   Chapter 11    Working With Files  } catch  IOException e  {     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  The only real simplification that can be done is by calling Files.newBufferedWriter ..    to avoid instantiating the BufferedWriter explicitly. This also adds in the advantage of  deciding the charset of the file to be written.  try  final BufferedWriter wr = Files.newBufferedWriter file.toPath  ,    StandardCharsets.UTF_8  {      lyricList.forEach lyric -> {           try {                 wr.write lyric ;                 wr.newLine  ;           } catch  IOException e  {                 e.printStackTrace  ;           }       } ;      wr.flush  ; } catch  IOException e  {      log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  If we did not have the Files.newBufferedWriter ..  method, writing text values   using a given charset would only be possible by using a different Writer class, the  OutputStreamWriter.  try  final OutputStreamWriter wr = new OutputStreamWriter       new FileOutputStream file , StandardCharsets.UTF_8  {     lyricList.forEach lyric -> {     try {             wr.write lyric ;             wr.write "\n" ;         } catch  IOException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } ;     wr.flush  ;  497   Chapter 11    Working With Files  } catch  IOException e  {     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  If the file already exists, calling the write ..  method overrides the contents of the   file. But this is not always needed, sometimes we just need to append new text to an  existing file. BufferedWriter provides the append   method to do that.  try  final BufferedWriter wr = Files.newBufferedWriter file.toPath  ,    StandardCharsets.UTF_8  {      lyricList.forEach lyric -> {           try {                 wr.append lyric ;                 wr.append "\n" ;           } catch  IOException e  {                 e.printStackTrace  ;           }       } ;      wr.flush  ; } catch  IOException e  {      log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ; }  Now that the basics of using BufferedWriter have been covered, it’s time to meet the   Writer family, which is depicted in Figure 11-4.  Figure 11-4.  The Writer class hierarchy  498   Chapter 11    Working With Files  The Writer class is abstract so it cannot be used directly, the appending API comes  from the java.io.Appendable interface, which Writer implements. The other Writer  classes are used for different purposes. As we’ve already seen, the OutputStreamWriter  writes text using a special character set.  The PrintWriter writes formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.    We used it to write HTML code in Chapter 10 .  The StringWriter collects output into its internal buffer and write it to a String   instance.  In Java 11, the Writer was enriched with the nullWriter   method, which returns a   Writer instance that does nothing. This was requested by developers for testing purposes.   Using OutputStream to Write Files Classes in the Writer family are advanced classes for writing data as text using  character streams; but essentially, before data is written, it is turned into bytes. This  means that files can be written by using stream of bytes as well. This probably became  clear when trying to use the proper character encoding when writing text using the  OutputStreamWriter, as the OutputStreamWriter instance given as argument is based  on a FileOutputStream instance, a type that writes byte streams to a file.  The root class of this hierarchy is java.io.OutputStream, which is depicted in   Figure 11-5.  Figure 11-5.  OutputStream class hierarchy  499   Chapter 11    Working With Files  And since I mentioned FileOutputStream, let’s see how we could use it to write   the same list of entries that we have used before. The code is depicted in the following  listing.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.writing;  import com.apress.bgn.ch11.reading.FileInputStreamReadingDemo; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.File; import java.io.FileNotFoundException; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.List;  public class FileOutputStreamWritingDemo {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger FileOutputStreamWritingDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File file = new File              "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output vultures3.txt" ;           List  lyricList =  List.of "Some of us, we're hardly ever   here",                  "The rest of us, we're born to disappear",                 "How do I stop myself from",                 "Being just a number?" ;          try  FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream file  {             lyricList.forEach lyric -> {                 try {                     output.write lyric.getBytes   ;                     output.write "\n".getBytes   ;  500   Chapter 11    Working With Files                  } catch  IOException e  {                     log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;                 }             } ;             output.flush  ;         } catch  FileNotFoundException e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         } catch  IOException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;         }     } }  The OutputStream family class is used for writing streams of bytes that represent raw  data, unreadable by users directly, such as the one contained in binary files like images,  media, PDFs, and so forth. For example, the next piece of code, makes a copy of an image  using FileInputStream to read it and FileOutputStream to write it.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.*; import java.nio.file.Files;  public class DuplicateImageDemo {      private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger DuplicateImageDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File src = new File             "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources input cat.jpg" ;         File dest = new File             "chapter11 read-write-file src main resources output cat1.jpg" ;  501   Chapter 11    Working With Files          try FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream src ;             FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream dest   {             int content;             while   content = fis.read    != -1  {                 fos.write content ;             }         } catch  FileNotFoundException e  {             log.error "Something bad happened.", e ;         } catch  IOException e  {             log.error "Something bad happened.", e ;         }     } }  But writing code like this is no longer necessary, thanks to the introduction of the   Files.copy src.toPath  , dest.toPath    method in Java 1.7.  In Java 11, the OutputStream was enriched with the nullOutputStream   method,   which returns an OutputStream instance that does nothing. This was requested by  developers for testing purposes.  And that’s about all the space that I can allocate in this book for writing files using   byte streams. Since there is a lot more to cover, two things before moving on…     When working with multiple files, do not open too many at the same  time, because some operating systems have a limit of how many files  a process can open at the same time. If you end up going over that  limit an IOException with a Too many open files message is thrown.     We did not cover in this book, but take extra care when working with  threads and files, because a file can be read by more than one thread  simultaneously, but more threads writing to the same file can lead to  unexpected results.   Serialization and Deserialization Serialization is the name given to the operation of converting the state of an object to  a byte stream so it can be sent over a network or written to a file and reverted back into  a copy of that object. The operation to covert the byte stream back to an object is called   502   Chapter 11    Working With Files  deserialization. Java Serialization has been a controversial topic, Java Platform Chief  Architect Mark Reinhold describing it as a horrible mistake done in 1997. Apparently  most Java vulnerabilities are somehow related to the way serialization is done in Java  and there is a project named Amber1 that is dedicated to remove Java serialization  completely and allow developers to choose the serialization in a format of their choice.  Currently, things are unstable in Java; there were a lot of changes introduced in a   short time that an industry addicted to backward compatibility was unable to adapt to.  Sources in the next section might be unstable, but I will do my best to keep them at least  compliable by the time the book is published, and I will maintain the repository and  answer questions as much as possible.   Binary Serialization The java.io.Serializable interface has no methods or fields and serves only to mark  classes as being serializable. When an object is serialized, the information that identifies  the object type is serialized as well. Most Java classes are serializable. Any subclass of  a serializable class is by default considered serializable, but if any new fields are non-  serializable an exception of type NotSerializableException is thrown. Classes written  by developers that contain non-serializable fields must implement the Serializable  interface and provide a concrete implementation for the following methods:  private void writeObject java.io.ObjectOutputStream out       throws IOException;  private void readObject java.io.ObjectInputStream in       throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;  private void readObjectNoData        throws ObjectStreamException;  The writeObject method is used for writing the state of the object, so that the   readObject method can restore it. The readObjectNoData method initializes the state  of the object when the deserialization operation failed for some reason, so this method  provides a default state despite the issues  e.g., incomplete stream, client application  does not recognize the reserialized class, etc. . This method is not really mandatory if  you are an optimist.  1 Project Amber official page http:  openjdk.java.net projects amber   503   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Also when making a class serializable, a static field of type long must be added as an   unique identifier for the class to make sure both the application that sends the object   as a byte stream and the client application receiving it have the same loaded classes.  If the application that receives the byte stream has a class with a different identifier,  a java.io.InvalidClassException is thrown. When this happens, this means the  application was not updated, or you can even suspect fowl-play from a hacker. The field  has to be named serialVersionUID, and if the developer does not explicitly add one, the  serialization runtime will. The following code snippet depicts a class named Singer that  contains serialization and deserialization methods.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import java.io.*; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.Objects;  public class Singer implements Serializable {     private static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;      private String name;      private Double rating;      private LocalDate birthDate;      public Singer   {          * required for deserialization *      }      public Singer String name, Double rating, LocalDate birthDate  {         this.name = name;         this.rating = rating;         this.birthDate = birthDate;     }      private void writeObject ObjectOutputStream out           throws IOException {         out.defaultWriteObject  ;     }  504   Chapter 11    Working With Files      private void readObject ObjectInputStream in          throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {         in.defaultReadObject  ;     }      private void readObjectNoData           throws ObjectStreamException {         this.name = "undefined";         this.rating = 0.0;         this.birthDate = LocalDate.now  ;     }      @Override     public String toString   {         return "Singer{" +                 "name='" + name + '\” +                 ", rating=" + rating +                 ", birthDate=" + birthDate +                 '}';     }      @Override     public boolean equals Object o  {         if  this == o  return true;         if  o == null  getClass   != o.getClass    return false;         Singer singer =  Singer  o;         return Objects.equals name, singer.name  &&                 Objects.equals rating, singer.rating  &&                 Objects.equals birthDate, singer.birthDate ;     }      @Override     public int hashCode   {         return Objects.hash name, rating, birthDate ;     } }  505   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Now that we have the class, let’s instantiate it, serialize it, save it to a file and then   deserialize the contents of the file into another object that we compare with the initial object.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.*; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.time.Month;  public class SerializationDemo {      private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger SerializationDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  throws ClassNotFoundException {         LocalDate johnBd = LocalDate.of 1977, Month.OCTOBER, 16 ;         Singer john = new Singer "John Mayer", 5.0, johnBd ;          File file = new File             "chapter11 serialization src main resources output john.txt" ;         try  ObjectOutputStream out =             new ObjectOutputStream new FileOutputStream file   {             out.writeObject john ;         } catch  IOException e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         }          try ObjectInputStream in =             new ObjectInputStream new FileInputStream file   {             Singer copyOfJohn =  Singer  in.readObject  ;             log.info "Are objects equal? {}", copyOfJohn.equals john  ;             log.info "--> {}", copyOfJohn.toString   ;         } catch  IOException e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         }     } }  506   Chapter 11    Working With Files  When the code is run, everything works as expected; the writeObject and the   readObject are called by the ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream respectively. If  you want to test that they are called, you can add logging, or you can place breakpoints  inside them and run the program in debug. If you open the john.txt you won’t be able to  understand much. The text written in there, does not make much sense, because it is binary,  raw data. If you open the file, you might see something like what is depicted in Figure 11-6.  Figure 11-6.  Serialized Singer instance   XML Serialization But, Java serialization does not have to result in cryptic files, objects can be serialized  to readable formats. One of the most used serialization format is XML and JDK  provides classes to convert objects to XML and from XML back to the initial object. Java  Architecture for XML Binding  JAXB  provides a fast and convenient way to bind XML  schemas and Java representations, making it easy for Java developers to incorporate  XML data and processing functions in Java applications. The operation to serialize an  object to XML is named marshalling. The operation to deserialize an object form XML  is called unmarshalling. For a class to be serializable to XML, it has to be decorated with  JAXB-specific annotations.              @XmlRootElement name = "..."  is a top-level annotation that is  placed at class level to tell JAXB that the class name becomes an XML  element at serialization time; if a different name is needed for the  XML element, it can be specified via the name attribute.  @XmlElement name = ".."  is a method or field level annotation that  tells JAXB that the field or method name becomes an XML element at  serialization time; if a different name is needed for the XML element,  it can be specified via the name attribute.  @XmlAttribute name = ".."  is a method or field level annotation  that tells JAXB that the field or method name becomes an XML  attribute at serialization time; if a different name is needed for the  XML attribute, it can be specified via the name attribute.  507   Chapter 11    Working With Files  JAXB was removed from JDK 11, so if you want to use it, you must add external   dependencies. At the moment this chapter is being written it is also more than a little  unstable, class com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.ContextFactory is part of the   jaxb- impl library, which cannot be found on any public repository at the moment, at  least not a version that was compiled with Java 11. The following is the code to make the  Singer class serializable with JAXB.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.xml;  import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement; import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement; import java.io.Serializable; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.Objects;  @XmlRootElement name = “singer”  public class Singer implements Serializable {     private static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;      private String name;      private Double rating;      private LocalDate birthDate;      public Singer   {          * required for deserialization *      }      public Singer String name, Double rating, LocalDate birthDate  {         this.name = name;         this.rating = rating;         this.birthDate = birthDate;     }      @XmlAttribute name = “name”      public String getName   {         return name;     }  508   Chapter 11    Working With Files      @XmlAttribute name = “rating”      public Double getRating   {         return rating;     }      @XmlElement name = “birthdate”      public LocalDate getBirthDate   {         return birthDate;     } ... }  Notice the location where the annotations were placed. Based on the placement of  the annotation in the code when the john object is serialized, the following is what you  find in the john.xml file.          1977-10-16T00:00:00Z     More readable than the binary version, right? The next code snippet depicts the code   that saves the Singer instance to the john.xml file; it loads it back into a copy, and then  the two instances are compared.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.xml;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext; import javax.xml.bind.JAXBException; import javax.xml.bind.Marshaller; import javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller; import java.io.*; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.time.Month;  509   Chapter 11    Working With Files  public class JAXBSerializationDemo {      private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger JAXBSerializationDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args           throws ClassNotFoundException, JAXBException {         LocalDate johnBd = LocalDate.of 1977, Month.OCTOBER, 16 ;         Singer john = new Singer "John Mayer", 5.0, johnBd ;          File file = new File              "chapter11 serialization src main resources output john.xml" ;         JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance Singer.class ;          try {             Marshaller marshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller  ;             marshaller.setProperty Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true ;             marshaller.marshal john, file ;         } catch  Exception e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         }          try {             Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller  ;             Singer copyOfJohn =  Singer  unmarshaller.unmarshal file ;             log.info "Are objects equal? {}", copyOfJohn.equals john  ;             log.info "--> {}", copyOfJohn.toString   ;         } catch  Exception e  {             log.info "Something went wrong! ", e ;         }     } }  The class javax.xml.bind.JAXBContext is created by calling the newInstance static   method and is given as argument a list of classes that will be handled  marshalled,  unmarshalled  by this context instance. If none are specified, the JAXBContext only  knows about spec-defined classes and those are the only ones that can be handled by the  instance.  510   Chapter 11    Working With Files  XML serialization has been dominating the development field for a lot of years, being   used in most web services and remote communication. But XML files tend to become  crowded, redundant and painful to read as they become bigger. So, a new format stole  the show: JSON.   JSON Serialization JSON JavaScript Object Notation  is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is readable  for humans and is easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is the favorite format  for data being used in JavaScript applications, for REST based application and is the  internal format used by quite a few NoSQL databases. So, it is only appropriate that  we show you how to serialize Java objects using this format as well. The advantage of  serializing Java objects to JSON is that there is more than one library providing classes to  do so, which means at least one of them is stable with Java 9+ versions.  The most preferred library for JSON serialization is the Jackson library2, because it can  convert Java objects to JSON objects and back again without much code being needed to  be written. Unfortunately, no version compatible with Java 9+ had been released yet, so for  this section, a less advanced library compatible with Java 9+ will be used.  JSON format is a collection of key-pair values. The values can be arrays, or collections   of key-pairs themselves. Converting Java objects to JSON objects using the JSON library   yes, it’s named exactly like that  is easy. We create a JSONObject and populate it with the  field names and values of the Singer object, and then we convert the JSONObject to String  and eventually write it to a file. In the following code sample, we skipped the writing to file  part and we transform the String back into a copy of the initial Singer object.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11.json;  import com.apress.bgn.ch11.xml.Singer; import org.json.JSONObject; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.time.LocalDate; import java.time.Month; import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;  2 Official GitHub repository for the company that produces the Jackson library https:  github. com FasterXML  511   Chapter 11    Working With Files  public class JsonSerializationDemo {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger JsonSerializationDemo.class ;          public static void main String... args  {             LocalDate johnBd = LocalDate.of 1977, Month.OCTOBER, 16 ;             Singer john = new Singer "John Mayer", 5.0, johnBd ;              JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject  ;             jsonObject.put "name", john.getName   ;             jsonObject.put "rating", john.getRating   ;             jsonObject.put "birthdate", john.getBirthDate  .toString   ;             String jsonData = jsonObject.toString 2 ;             log.info "--> Serialized {}", jsonData ;              JSONObject readJson = new JSONObject jsonData ;             Singer copyOfJohn = new Singer  String  readJson.get "name" ,                      Double.parseDouble   Integer readJson.get "rating"  .  toString   ,                      LocalDate.parse  String readJson.get "birthdate" ,                           DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE  ;             log.info "Are objects equal? {}", copyOfJohn.equals john  ;             log.info "--> Deserialized {}", copyOfJohn ;         } }  The number given as a parameter to the jsonObject.toString 2 ; method is   an indentation value used to format the resulted text. When the previous program is  executed, the output you can expect to see in the console should look very similar to this.  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.json.JsonSerializationDemo - --> Serialized {   "birthdate": "1977-10-16",   "name": "John Mayer",   "rating": 5 }  512   Chapter 11    Working With Files  [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.json.JsonSerializationDemo - Are objects  equal? true [main] INFO com.apress.bgn.ch11.json.JsonSerializationDemo - -->    Deserialized Singer{name='John Mayer', rating=5.0, birthDate=1977-10-16}  Theoretically this library provides a method to serialize an object directly by calling:  LocalDate johnBd = LocalDate.of 1977, Month.OCTOBER, 16 ; Singer john = new Singer "John Mayer", 5.0, johnBd ; JSONObject jo = new JSONObject john ;  But the version that the project is currently using seems to have a bug and cannot   actually do that. So, the only hope for developers that plan to write Java 9+ applications  to use practical JSON serialization deserialization is to either build one themselves, or to  hope that a stable version of Jackson built with Java9+ is available soon.   The Media API Aside from text data, Java can manipulate binary files such as images. The Java Media  API contains a set of image encoder decoder  codec  classes for several popular image  storage formats: BMP, GIF  decoder only , FlashPix  decoder only , JPEG, PNG, PNM3,  TIFF, and WBMP.  In Java 9, the Java media API was transformed as well and functionality to   encapsulate many images with different resolutions into a multiresolution image was  added.  The core of the Java Media API is the java.awt.Image class that is the superclass to  represent graphical images. The most important image classes and their relationships  are depicted in Figure 11-7.  3 The portable pixmap format  PPM , the portable graymap format  PGM  and the portable  bitmap format  PBM  are image file formats designed to be easily exchanged between platforms.  They are also sometimes referred to collectively as the portable any map format  PNM . More  details at https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Netpbm_format  513   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Figure 11-7.  Image classes hierarchy  Although the java.awt.Image class is the most important in this hierarchy, the   most used is java.awt.BufferedImage, which is an implementation with an accessible  buffer of image data. It provides a lot of methods to create an image, to set its size and its  contents, to extract its contents and analyze them, and so much more. In this section, we  make use of this class to read and write images.  An image file is a complex file, aside from the picture itself, contains a lot of   additional information, the most important nowadays is the location where that image  was created. If you ever wondered how a social network proposes a check-in location  for an image you are posting, this is where the information is found. This might not  seem that important, but posting a picture of your cat, taken in your house, exposes your  location to the whole world getting their hands on it. I’m not sure what you think about  it, but to me this is terrifying. I used to post pictures of my cat sitting comfortable on the  computer I am writing this book on now on my personal blog. I basically exposed my  location and that of an expensive laptop to the whole world. Sure, most people do not  care about my cat, nor the laptop, but somebody that might be looking to make an easy  buck might. So, after a friendly and knowledgeable reader send me a private email telling  be about something called EXIF data and how he knows where I live because of the last  picture I’ve posted on my blog, I looked into it. A photo’s EXIF data contains a ton of  information about your camera, and where the picture was taken  GPS coordinates .  Most smartphones embed EXIF data into pictures taken with their camera. Figure 11-8  shows the EXIF information depicted in the macOS Preview application.  514   Chapter 11    Working With Files  Figure 11-8.  EXIF information on a JPG image  The EXIF info contains the exact location  latitude and longitude included  where   the picture was taken. EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format. There are  utilities to remove it, but when you post a lot of pictures on your blog  like I do , it takes  too much time to clean them one by one. This is where Java comes in and I will share  with you a snippet of code that I use to clean my pictures of EXIF data.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.apache.commons.imaging.formats.jpeg.exif.ExifRewriter; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  515   Chapter 11    Working With Files  import javax.imageio.ImageIO; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.image.BaseMultiResolutionImage; import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; import java.io.*; import java.util.List;  public class MediaDemo {      private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger MediaDemo.  class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File src = new File             "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_sky.jpg" ;         try {             log.info " --- Removing EXIF info ---" ;             File destNoExif = new File                 "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_sky_  noexif.jpg" ;              removeExifTag destNoExif, src ;          } catch  Exception e  {             log.error "Something bad happened.", e ;         }     }      private static void removeExifTag final File dest, final File src           throws Exception {        new ExifRewriter  .removeExifMetadata src, new FileOutputStream dest  ;     } }  To easily remove EXIF data, a utility class called ExifRewriter is used. It is part of  a library named Sanselan created by Apache. This library is unmaintained, but since  it doesn’t have any dependencies, compiling it with JDK 11 works just fine. I’ve forked  the GitHub repository and created my own branch named feature jdk11-gradle-  build at https:  github.com iuliana sanselan. The artifact resulted by building  that branch was added as a dependency to the project. That is why the ExifRewriter. removeExifMetadata   can be used. This method is given as an argument the source of   516   Chapter 11    Working With Files  the image and an OutputStream to a location where the new image should be saved. To  test that the resulting image has no EXIF data, open it in an image viewer, any option that  shows EXIF should either be disabled or should display nothing. In the Preview image  viewer in macOS, the option is grayed out.  Now that we got that out of the way, let’s resize the resulted image. To resize an image   we need to create a BufferedImage instance from the original image to get the image  dimensions. After that, we modify the dimensions and use them as arguments to create a  new BufferedImage, which is populated with data by a java.awt.Graphics2D instance,  a special type of class that renders 2D shapes, text, and images. The code is depicted in  the next listing. And the method is called to create an image 25% smaller, an image 50%  smaller, and an image 75% smaller.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.apache.commons.imaging.formats.jpeg.exif.ExifRewriter; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import javax.imageio.ImageIO; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.image.BaseMultiResolutionImage; import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; import java.io.*; import java.util.List;  public class MediaDemo {      private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger MediaDemo.  class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File src = new File             "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_sky.jpg" ;         try {             log.info " --- Removing EXIF info ---" ;             File destNoExif = new File                 "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_sky_  noexif.jpg" ;              removeExifTag destNoExif, src ;  517   Chapter 11    Working With Files              log.info " --- Creating 25% image ---" ;             File dest25 = new File                   "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_  sky_25.jpg" ;              resize dest25, destNoExif, 0.25f ;              log.info " --- Creating 50% image ---" ;             File dest50 = new File                  "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_  sky_50.jpg" ;              resize dest50, destNoExif, 0.5f ;              log.info " --- Creating 75% image ---" ;             File dest75 = new File                  "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_  sky_75.jpg" ;              resize dest75, destNoExif, 0.75f ;          } catch  Exception e  {             log.error "Something bad happened.", e ;         }     }       private static void resize final File dest, final File src, final float   percent           throws IOException {         BufferedImage originalImage = ImageIO.read src ;         int scaledWidth =  int   originalImage.getWidth   * percent ;         int scaledHeight =  int   originalImage.getHeight   * percent ;          BufferedImage outputImage = new BufferedImage scaledWidth,             scaledHeight, originalImage.getType   ;          Graphics2D g2d = outputImage.createGraphics  ;         g2d.drawImage originalImage, 0, 0, scaledWidth, scaledHeight, null ;         g2d.dispose  ;         outputImage.flush  ;  518   Chapter 11    Working With Files           ImageIO.write outputImage, “jpg”, dest ;     }     ... }  To make things easier, the ImageIO class utility methods come in handy for reading   images from files, or writing them to a specific location. If you want to test that the  resizing works, you can look in the resources directory.  The output files have already been named accordingly, but to make sure, you can  double check in a file viewer. You should see something similar to what is depicted in  Figure 11-9.  Figure 11-9.  Images resized using Java code  The resulting images are not as high in quality as the original image, because   compressing the pixels does not result in higher quality, but they do fit the sizes we  intended.  Now that we have all these versions of the same image we can use them to create a   multiresolution image using the BaseMultiResolutionImage class introduced in Java 9.   An instance of this class is created from a set of images, all copy of a single image,  but with different resolutions. This is why we created more than one resized copy of  the image. A BaseMultiResolutionImage retrieves images based on specific screen  resolutions and it is suitable for applications designed to be accessed from multiple  devices. Let’s see the code first and then explain the results.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import org.apache.commons.imaging.formats.jpeg.exif.ExifRewriter; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  519   Chapter 11    Working With Files  import javax.imageio.ImageIO; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.image.BaseMultiResolutionImage; import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; import java.io.*; import java.util.List;  public class MediaDemo {      private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger MediaDemo.  class ;      public static void main String... args  {         File src = new File             "chapter11 media-handling src main resources scottish_sky.jpg" ;         try {             Image[] imgList = new Image[]{                       ImageIO.read dest25 ,    1008 x 277                       ImageIO.read dest50 ,   2016 x 554                       ImageIO.read dest75 ,    3024 x 831                       ImageIO.read src     4032 x 1108             };              log.info " --- Creating multi-resolution image ---" ;             File destVariant = new File                   "chapter11 media-handling src main resources sky_variant.jpg" ;             createMultiResImage destVariant, imgList ;         } catch  Exception e  {             log.error "Something bad happened.", e ;         }     }       private static void createMultiResImage final File dest, final Image[]           throws IOException {          MultiResolutionImage mrImage = new BaseMultiResolutionImage 0,   imgList   imgList ;  520   Chapter 11    Working With Files          List  variants = mrImage.getResolutionVariants  ;          variants.forEach System.out::println ;          Image img = mrImage.getResolutionVariant 700, 250 ;         log.info "Most fit to the requested size :  ", 700, 250,              img.getWidth null , img.getHeight null  ;          if  img instanceof BufferedImage  {             ImageIO.write  BufferedImage  img, "jpg", dest ;         }      }     ... }  To clearly show which image is selected, the resolution of each image has a comment   next to it. The BaseMultiResolutionImage instance is created from an array of Image  instances. When getResolutionVariant ..  is called, the arguments are compared  to the corresponding image properiest, and if both are less than equal to the values  of one of the images, that image is returned. In the next code snippet, the code of the  BaseMultiResolutionImage.getResolutionVariant ..  is depicted.  @Override public Image getResolutionVariant double destImageWidth,                           double destImageHeight  {          checkSize destImageWidth, destImageHeight ;          for  Image rvImage : resolutionVariants  {             if  destImageWidth <= rvImage.getWidth null                      && destImageHeight <= rvImage.getHeight null   {                 return rvImage;             }         }         return resolutionVariants[resolutionVariants.length - 1]; }  521   Chapter 11    Working With Files  The previous code leads to two conclusions.     Both the desired width and height that are given as arguments  must be less or equal to the properties of one of the images the  multiresolution image was created from; otherwise, the default image  is returned—the one with the index given as argument for the base  image index in the BaseMultiResolutionImage constructor. This  means that getResolutionVariant 700, 250  returns image dest25  because 700 <= 1008 && 250 <= 277 and  1008 x 277  is the  width  x height  of this image. The call getResolutionVariant 700, 300   leads to image src being returned, because the previous condition is  no longer evaluated to true while iterating the list, so the last image in  the list is retuned, because the method exits through return   resolutionVariants[resolutionVariants.length - 1];     The array the BaseMultiResolutionImage instance is created from   must be sorted in ascending order of the width and height of the  images; otherwise, an image with the wrong dimensions is returned,  because the decision algorithm is not that efficient.  So, if the algorithm is not efficient what can be done? It’s simple: we can create our  own MultiResolutionImage implementation that extends BaseMultiResolutionImage  and overrides the getResolutionVariant   method. Since we know that all images are  resized copies of the same image, this means width and height are proportional. So, an  algorithm that always returns the variant of the image that is most suitable to the desired  resolution can be written that does not really care about the order of the images in the  array, and that it returns the image that fits most. So, the implementation might look  similar to the following class.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import java.awt.*; import java.awt.image.BaseMultiResolutionImage; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;  522   Chapter 11    Working With Files  public class SmartMultiResolutionImage     extends BaseMultiResolutionImage {      public SmartMultiResolutionImage int baseImageIndex,         Image... resolutionVariants  {         super baseImageIndex, resolutionVariants ;     }      @Override     public Image getResolutionVariant double destImageWidth,                                       double destImageHeight  {         checkSize destImageWidth, destImageHeight ;          Map  result = new HashMap   ;          for  Image rvImage : getResolutionVariants    {              double widthDelta = Math.abs destImageWidth - rvImage.               double heightDelta = Math.abs destImageHeight - rvImage.  getWidth null  ;  getHeight null  ;              double delta = widthDelta + heightDelta;             result.put delta, rvImage ;         }          java.util.List  deltaList = new ArrayList  result.keySet   ;         deltaList.sort Double::compare ;          return result.get deltaList.get 0  ;     }      private static void checkSize double width, double height  {         if  width <= 0  height <= 0  {             throw new IllegalArgumentException String.format                       "Width  %s  or height  %s  cannot be <= 0", width,           }  height  ;  523   Chapter 11    Working With Files          if  !Double.isFinite width   !Double.isFinite height   {             throw new IllegalArgumentException String.format                       "Width  %s  or height  %s  is not finite", width,   height  ;          }     }  }  The checkSize ..  method must be duplicated, as it is private and used  inside getResolutionVariant .. , so it cannot be called inside a superclass,  but that is a minor inconvenience to having an implementation that has a proper  behavior. In the previous implementation, we no longer need a sorted array. Also,  calls to getResolutionVariant 700, 250 , getResolutionVariant 700, 300 ,  getResolutionVariant 800, 250 , getResolutionVariant 800, 400  all return  image dest25.

Why are the images not identical? Well, they do have the same resolution,   but as objects are not identical, because drawing pixels is not really that precise. But if  you really want to make sure, you could print the width and height of the two images,  open them with an image viewer and notice that to the naked eye, they look identical.  log.info "variant width x height :  {} x {}", variantImg.getWidth  ,    variantImg.getHeight   ; log.info "dest25Img width x height :  {} x {}", dest25Img.getWidth  ,    dest25Img.getHeight   ;  The code prints the width and height of the two images, making it obvious that the   two images have the same dimensions, just as expected.

The part that I like most about  this class is that the images can be also displayed scaled, without the original image  being modified.  To create a javafx.scene.image.Image instance, all we need is a FileInputStream  instance to read the image from the user-provided location, or a URL location given as  String. The following code snippet creates a JavaFX application that displays an   image with its original width and height, which can be accessed using methods in the  javafx.scene.image.Image class.  package com.apress.bgn.ch11;  import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.image.Image; import javafx.scene.image.ImageView;  526   Chapter 11    Working With Files  import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane; import javafx.stage.Stage;  import java.io.File; import java.io.FileInputStream;  public class JavaFxMediaDemo extends Application {      public static void main String... args  {         Application.launch args ;     }      @Override     public void start Stage primaryStage  throws Exception {         primaryStage.setTitle "JavaFX Image Demo" ;          File src = new File "chapter11 media-handling src main resources   cover.png" ;          Image image = new Image new FileInputStream src  ;          ImageView imageView = new ImageView image ;         imageView.setFitHeight image.getHeight   ;         imageView.setFitWidth image.getWidth   ;         imageView.setPreserveRatio true ;            Creating a Group object         StackPane root = new StackPane  ;         root.getChildren  .add imageView ;         primaryStage.setScene new Scene root,             image.getWidth  +10,             image.getHeight  +10  ;         primaryStage.show  ;     } }  The Image instance cannot be added to the Scene of the JavaFX instance directly  as it does not implement the Node interface, which is required to be implemented by  all JavaFX elements that make a JavaFX application. That is why this instance must be  wrapped in a javafx.scene.image.ImageView instance that is a class implementing  node, which is a specialized class for painting images loaded with Image class.  527   Chapter 11    Working With Files  This class resizes the displayed image with or without preserving the original aspect  ratio by calling the setPreserveRatio ..  method with the appropriate argument: true  to keep the original aspect ratio; false otherwise.  In the previous code, we use the values retuned by image.getWidth   and image. getHeight   to set the size of the ImageView object and the size of the Scene instance.  But let’s get creative and display the scaled image, still preserving the aspect ratio  and also using a better-quality filtering algorithm when scaling the image using the  smooth ..  method.  ... ImageView imageView = new ImageView image ; imageView.setFitWidth 100 ; imageView.setPreserveRatio true ; imageView.setSmooth true ; ...

By calling onMouseClicked, we attached an EventHandler    instance to the mouse-clicking event on imageView. The EventHandler<T extends  Event> is a functional interface containing a single method named handle, and its  concrete implementation is the body of the lambda expression in the previous code  listing.  Since JavaFX was taken out of JDK 11, there is no real value in going over more   image processing classes in this section. But if you are interested in learning more about  this subject, this tutorial from Oracle should do the job: https:  docs.oracle.com  javafx 2 image_ops jfxpub-image_ops.htm. Also, as practice, you can try writing your  own code, based on the code in the book, to add a mouse event that rotates the image.  And this is all the space that I can dedicate to playing with images in the Java. I hope  you found this section useful and might get the chance to test your Java Media API skills  in the future, if not for anything else, at least for cleaning EXIF data from your images.   Summary This chapter has covered most of the information that you need to know to work with  various types of files, and to serialize Java objects, save them to a file, and then recover  them through deserialization. When writing Java applications, you typically need to save   529   Chapter 11    Working With Files  data to files or read data from files and this chapter provides a wide list of components to  do so. The following is a short summary of this chapter.     how to use File and Path instances     how to use utility methods in Files and Paths     how to serialize deserialize Java objects to from binary, XML and   JSON     how to resize and modify images using the Java Media API     how to use images in JavaFX applications  530   CHAPTER 12  The Publish Subscribe  Framework  All the programming concepts explained so far involved data that needed to be  processed. Regardless of the form in which data is provided, the Java programs we’ve  written so far took that data, modified it, and printed the results, whether to the console,  to files, or to another software component. You could say that all of these components  were communicating with each other and passing processed data from one to another.  Figure 12-1 abstractly describes interactions among Java components in a program.  Figure 12-1.  Interactions between Java components within a program  Each of the arrows is marked with the type of information being passed from  one component to another. In Figure 12-1, you can identify a starting point where  information enters the program  by being read by the Reader , and an end point where  the information is printed to some output component by the Printer. So, you could  say that the Reader provides the data, the Filter and the DocumentCreator are some  internal processor, processing the data and the Printer is the consumer of the data.  What was described so far is resembles a point-to-point  p2p  messaging model,   which describes a concept of one message being send to one consumer. The p2p  model is specific to an Java API called Java Message Service  JMS  that supports the  formal communication known as messaging between computers in a network. In the  example that begins this chapter an analogy was made to show that communication     Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_12  531   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  between components of a Java Program works in a similar manner. And so, the design  of a solution to implement a process as described in Figure 12-1 could be created by  considering all components linked into a messaging style communication model. There  is more than one communication model—Producer Consumer, Publish Subscribe,  Sender Receiver, each with its own specifics,1 but this chapter is focused on Publish  Subscribe because it is the model that reactive programming is based on.   Reactive Programming and the Reactive Manifesto Reactive programming is a declarative programming style that involves using data  streams and propagation of change. You learned how to use streams in Chapter 8, so  we’re one step closer. Now all we must do is learn how to use reactive streams. Reactive  programming involves using asynchronous data streams or event streams. Using reactive  streams is not a new idea.  The Reactive Manifesto was first made public in 2014.2 It made a request for software   to be developed in such a way that systems are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message  driven, in short they should be reactive. The following explains each of the four terms.     Responsive should provide fast and consistent response times.     Resilient should remain responsive in case of failure and be able to      Elastic should remain responsive and be able to handle various   recover.  workloads.     Message driven should communicate using asynchronous messages,   avoid blocking and applying back pressure when necessary.  Systems designed this way are supposed to be more flexible, loosely coupled, and  scalable, but at the same time they should be easier to develop, amendable to change  and more tolerant of failure. But to accomplish all that, the systems need a common API  for communication. Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide such a standard API for  asynchronous, non-blocking stream processing that also supports back-pressure. We’ll   1 If you are interested more in communication models, you can search the web for Enterprise  Integration Patterns. 2 Read it at https:  www.reactivemanifesto.org   532   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  explain what back-pressure means in a moment. Let’s start with the basics of reactive  stream processing.  Any type of stream processing involves a producer of data, a consumer of data, and   components in the middle between them that process the data. The direction of the data  flow is from the producer to the consumer. The abstract schema of a system is depicted  in Figure 12-2.  Figure 12-2.  Producer Consumer system  The system might end up in a pickle when the producer is faster than the consumer.   So the extra data that cannot be processed must be dealt with. There is more than one  way of doing that.     The extra data is discarded  this is done in network hardware .     The producer is blocked so the consumer has time to catch up.     The data is buffered, but buffers are limited and if we have a fast   producer and a slow consumer there is a danger of the buffer  overflowing.     By applying back pressure, which involves giving the consumer   the power to regulate the producer and control how much data is  produced. Back pressure can be viewed as a message being sent from  the consumer to the producer to let it know it has to slow its data  production rate. With this in mind, we can complete the design in  Figure 12-2, which results in Figure 12-3.  Figure 12-3.  Reactive Producer Consumer system  533   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  If producer, processors, and consumer are not synchronized, solving the problem  of too much data by blocking until each one is ready to process it is not an option, as  it would transform the system into a synchronous one. Discarding it is not an option  either, and buffering is, well, unpredictable, so all we’re left with for a reactive system is  applying non-blocking back-pressure.  Writing applications that can be aggregated in reactive systems was not possible in   Java before version 9, so developers had to make do with external libraries. A reactive  application must be designed according to principle of reactive programming and use  reactive streams for handling the data. The standard API for reactive programming was  first described by the reactive-streams library that could be used with Java 8 as well.  But in Java 9, the standard API was added to the JDK. Figure 12-4 shows the interfaces  that are meant to be implemented by components with the roles defined previously. The  reactive streams API is made of four very simple interfaces.  Figure 12-4.  Reactive Streams interfaces          interface Publisher  exposes one method named  subscribe Subscriber   that is called to add a  Subscriber instance and produces elements of type T, which are  consumed by the Subscriber.  interface Subscriber , consumes elements from the Publisher  and exposes four methods that must be implemented to define  concrete behavior of the instance depending on the event type  received by the Publisher instance.   – void onSubscribe Subscription  is the first method called on a    subscriber and this is the method that links the Publisher to the  Subscriber instance using the Subscription argument, if this method  throws an exception the following behavior is not guaranteed.  534   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework   – void onNext T  is the method invoked with a Subscription’s next item to   receive the data, if it throws an exception, the Subscription might be  cancelled.   – void onError Throwable  is the method invoked upon an unrecoverable   error encountered by a Publisher or Subscription.   – void onComplete  is the method called when there is not more data to   consume, thus no additional Subscriber method invocations occur.          interface Processor  extends both Publisher  and  Subscriber , because it needs to consume data and produce it to  send it further upstream.  interface Subscription, its implementation should link the  Publisher and the Subscriber and can be used to apply  back-  pressure by calling the request long  to set he number of items to  be produced and sent to the consumer. It also allows the cancellation  of a flow by calling the cancel   method to tell a Subscriber to stop  receiving messages.  In the JDK, all the previously listed interfaces are defined within the java.util. concurrent.Flow class. The name of this class is obvious in nature, as the previous  interfaces are used to create flow-controlled components that can be linked together  to create a reactive application. Aside from these four interfaces, there is a single  JDK implementation, the java.util.concurrent.SubmissionPublisher  class  implementing Publisher  that is a convenient base for subclasses that generate items  and use the methods in this class to publish them.  The Flow interfaces are basic and can be used when writing reactive applications,   but this requires a lot of work. Currently, there are multiple implementations by  various teams that provide a more practical way to develop reactive applications. Using  implementations of these interfaces, you can write reactive applications without needing  to write the logic for synchronization of threads processing the data.  The following list is of the most well-known reactive streams API implementations.     Project Reactor  https:  projectreactor.io   embraced by Spring   for its Web Reactive Framework     Akka Streams  https:  doc.akka.io docs akka current stream   stream-flows-and-basics.html   535   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework     MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver  http:  mongodb.github.io    mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams 1.9       Ratpack  https:  ratpack.io       RxJava  http:  reactivex.io    And there are more, because in a big data world, reactive data processing is no   longer a luxury, but a necessity.  This concludes the introduction into what reactive programming and what reactive   streams are. It is about time we get down to the code.   Using the JDK Reactive Streams API As the JDK provided interfaces for reactive programming are quite basic, implementing  them to build something really useful  is quite cumbersome, but nevertheless we will try.  In this section, an application that generates an infinite number of integer values, filters  these values, and selects the ones that are smaller than 127 is being built. For the ones  that are even and between 98 and 122, we subtract 32  basically converting small letters  to uppercase . Then we convert them to a character and print them.  Clearly, the most basic solution is  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger ReactiveMain.class ; private static final Random random = new Random  ;  public static void main String... args  {          while  true {             int rndNo = random.nextInt 150 ;             if  rndNo >=0 && rndNo < 127  {                 log.info "Initial value: {} ", rndNo ;                 if rndNo % 2 == 0 && rndNo >=98 && rndNo <=122  {                     rndNo -=32;                 }                 char res =  char  rndNo;                 log.info "Result: {}", res ;  536   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework              } else {                 log.debug "Number {} discarded.", rndNo ;             }         } }  Each line of code in the previous code listing has a purpose, a desired outcome.   This approach is called imperative programming, because it sequentially executes a  series of statements to produce a desired output.  But this is not what we are aiming for. In this section, we implement a reactive   solution using implementations of the JDK reactive interfaces. So we’ll need the  following.     A publisher component that makes use of an infinite stream to   generate random integer values. The class should implement the  Flow.Publisher  interface.     A processor that selects only integer values that can be converted   to visible characters, let’s say all characters with codes between  [0,127 . The class should implement the Flow.Processor<Integer,  Integer>.     A processor that modifies elements received, that are even, and   between 98 and 122, by subtracting 32. This class should also  implement the Flow.Processor .     A processor that transforms integer elements into the equivalent   characters. This is a special type of processor that maps one   value to another, of another type and should implement   Flow.Processor .     A subscriber that prints the received elements from the    last processor in the chain. This class implements the   Flow.Subscriber  interface.  Let’s start by declaring the Publisher that wraps around an infinite stream to   produce values to be consumed. We implement the Flow.Publisher   interface, but provide a full concrete implementation to submit the elements  asynchronously. To buffer them in case of need is a little much, so we’ll make use of Subm issionPublisher  in our class. The code for the publisher is depicted next.  537   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import java.util.Random; import java.util.concurrent.Flow; import java.util.concurrent.SubmissionPublisher; import java.util.stream.IntStream;  public class IntPublisher implements Flow.Publisher  {     private static final Random random = new Random  ;      private final IntStream intStream = IntStream.generate    -> random.  nextInt 150  ;      private final SubmissionPublisher          submissionPublisher = new SubmissionPublisher   ;      @Override     public void subscribe Flow.Subscriber  subscriber  {         submissionPublisher.subscribe subscriber ;     }      public void start   {         intStream.forEach element -> {             submissionPublisher.submit element ;             sleep  ;         } ;     }      private void sleep   {         try {             Thread.sleep 1000 ;         } catch  InterruptedException e  {             throw new RuntimeException "could not sleep!" ;         }     } }  538   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  As expected, we’ve provided an implementation for the subscribe   method, and   in this case, we have to forward the subscriber to the internal submissionPublisher.  Also, we’ve added a start   method that takes elements from the infinite IntStream  and submits them using the internal submissionPublisher. The IntStream makes use  of a Random instance to generate integer values in the [0,150] interval. This interval was  chosen so we can see how values bigger than 127 are discarded by the first Processor  instance connected to the publisher. To slow down the elements’ submission, we added  a call to Thread.sleep 1000  that basically guarantees one element per second is send  up the chain.  The name of the first processor is FilterCharProcessor and makes use of an internal   SubmissionPublisher  instance to send the elements it processes onward to  the next processor. Exceptions thrown are forwarded using the SubmissionPublisher    also. The processor acts as a publisher, but as a subscriber as well, so the  implementation on the onNext ..  method has to include a call to subscription. request ..  to apply back pressure. From the figures presented earlier in the chapter,  you could see that the processor is basically a component that allows data flow in both  directions, and it does that by implementing both Publisher and Subscriber. The processor must subscribe to the publisher, and when the publisher’s   subscribe ..  method is called, it causes the onSubscribe Flow.Subscription  subscription  method to be invoked. The subscription must be stored locally, so that  it can be used to apply back pressure. But when accepting a subscription, we must make  sure that the field was not already initialized, because according to reactive streams  specification there can only be one subscriber for a publisher; otherwise, the results are  unpredictable. So if and when a new subscription arrives, it must be cancelled, and this  is done by calling cancel  . The full code for the processor is depicted next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import com.apress.bgn.ch12.dummy.BasicIntTransformer; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.util.concurrent.Flow; import java.util.concurrent.SubmissionPublisher;  539   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  public class FilterCharProcessor implements      Flow.Processor  {      private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger FilterCharProcessor.class ;     private final SubmissionPublisher          submissionPublisher = new SubmissionPublisher   ;     private Flow.Subscription subscription;      @Override     public void subscribe Flow.Subscriber  subscriber  {         submissionPublisher.subscribe subscriber ;     }      @Override     public void onSubscribe Flow.Subscription subscription  {         if  this.subscription == null  {             this.subscription = subscription;                apply back pressure - request one element             this.subscription.request 1 ;         } else {             subscription.cancel  ;         }     }      @Override     public void onNext Integer element  {         if  element >=0 && element < 127 {             submit element ;         } else {             log.debug "Element {} discarded.", element ;         }         subscription.request 1 ;     }      @Override     public void onError Throwable throwable  {         submissionPublisher.closeExceptionally throwable ;     } 540   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework      @Override     public void onComplete   {         submissionPublisher.close  ;     }      protected void submit Integer element {         submissionPublisher.submit element ;     } }  We have three processor classes to build, and aside from the code in the   onNext ..  method body, the rest is boilerplate code that allows processor instances  to be linked together in the flow we are designing. So it would be practical to wrap up  this code in an AbstractProcessor that all processors needed for this solution can  extend. As the last processor we need to implement needs to convert the received  Integer value to a Character we keep this implementation generic regarding to the  type of value being sent to the next processor or subscriber in the flow. The code is  depicted next.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import java.util.concurrent.Flow; import java.util.concurrent.SubmissionPublisher;  public abstract class AbstractProcessor         implements Flow.Processor  {      protected final SubmissionPublisher         submissionPublisher = new SubmissionPublisher   ;     protected Flow.Subscription subscription;      @Override     public void subscribe Flow.Subscriber  subscriber  {         submissionPublisher.subscribe subscriber ;     }  541   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework      @Override     public void onSubscribe Flow.Subscription subscription  {         if  this.subscription == null  {             this.subscription = subscription;                apply back pressure - ask one or more than one             this.subscription.request 1 ;         } else {             subscription.cancel  ;         }     }      @Override     public void onError Throwable throwable  {         submissionPublisher.closeExceptionally throwable ;     }      @Override     public void onComplete   {         submissionPublisher.close  ;     }      protected void submit T element  {         submissionPublisher.submit element ;     } }  processors as well.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  public class FilterCharProcessor extends AbstractProcessor  {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger FilterCharProcessor.class ;  542  This simplifies a lot the implementation of the FilterCharProcessor and the other    Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework      @Override     public void onNext Integer element  {         if  element >= 0 && element < 127  {             submit element ;         } else {             log.debug "Element {} discarded.", element ;         }         subscription.request 1 ;     } }  We have a publisher and a processor, now what ? We connect them of course. The   dots  ...  in the next code snippet, replace all the processors and the subscribers being  connected to each other later in the chapter.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  public class ReactiveDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         IntPublisher publisher = new IntPublisher  ;          FilterCharProcessor filterCharProcessor = new   FilterCharProcessor  ;          publisher.subscribe filterCharProcessor ;         ...         publisher.start  ;     } }  The next processor implementation is the one that transforms lower case letters  into upper case letters by subtracting 32. It can be easily implemented by extending  AbstractProcessor as well.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  public class TransformerProcessor extends      AbstractProcessor  {  543   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework      @Override     public void onNext Integer element  {         if element % 2 == 0 && element >=98 && element <=122  {             element -=32;         }         submit element ;         subscription.request 1 ;     } }  To plug in this processor into the flow, we need instantiate it and call the   filterCharProcessor.subscribe ..  and provide this instance as an argument.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  public class ReactiveDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         IntPublisher publisher = new IntPublisher  ;          FilterCharProcessor filterCharProcessor = new            TransformerProcessor transformerProcessor = new   FilterCharProcessor  ;  TransformerProcessor  ;          publisher.subscribe filterCharProcessor ;         filterCharProcessor.subscribe transformerProcessor ;         ...         publisher.start  ;     } }  The next one to implement is the final processor needed for the solution. It converts   an Integer value to a Character value. To keep the implementation as declarative as  possible, the processor is provided the mapping function as an argument.  544   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import java.util.function.Function;  public class MappingProcessor extends      AbstractProcessor   {     private final Function  function;      public MappingProcessor Function  function  {         this.function = function;     }      @Override     public void onNext Integer element  {         submit function.apply element  ;         subscription.request 1 ;     } }  And now, to plug it in.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  public class ReactiveDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         IntPublisher publisher = new IntPublisher  ;         FilterCharProcessor filterCharProcessor = new FilterCharProcessor  ;           TransformerProcessor transformerProcessor = new   TransformerProcessor  ;           MappingProcessor mappingProcessor =              new MappingProcessor element ->  char  element.intValue   ;          publisher.subscribe filterCharProcessor ;         filterCharProcessor.subscribe transformerProcessor ;         transformerProcessor.subscribe mappingProcessor ;         ...         publisher.start  ;     } }  545   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  The last component of this flow is the subscriber that does nothing more than print   the values received from the transformerProcessor. The class implements the Flow. Subscriber  and most of it is identical to the code we’ve isolated in the  AbstractProcessor, but it is what it is.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.util.concurrent.Flow;  public class CharPrinter implements Flow.Subscriber  {     private static final Logger log =          LoggerFactory.getLogger CharPrinter.class ;     private Flow.Subscription subscription;      @Override     public void onSubscribe Flow.Subscription subscription  {         if  this.subscription == null  {             this.subscription = subscription;             this.subscription.request 1 ;         } else {             subscription.cancel  ;         }     }      @Override     public void onNext Character element  {         log.info "Result: {}", element ;           apply back-pressure again         subscription.request 1 ;     }      @Override     public void onError Throwable throwable  {         log.error "Something went wrong.", throwable ;     }  546   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework      @Override     public void onComplete   {         log.info "Printing complete." ;     } }  So now that we have a subscriber, we can plug it in and run the application.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  public class ReactiveDemo {     public static void main String... args  {         IntPublisher publisher = new IntPublisher  ;         FilterCharProcessor filterCharProcessor = new FilterCharProcessor  ;          TransformerProcessor transformerProcessor = new   TransformerProcessor  ;          MappingProcessor mappingProcessor =             new MappingProcessor element ->  char  element.intValue   ;         CharPrinter charPrinter = new CharPrinter  ;          publisher.subscribe filterCharProcessor ;         filterCharProcessor.subscribe transformerProcessor ;         transformerProcessor.subscribe mappingProcessor ;         mappingProcessor.subscribe charPrinter ;         publisher.start  ;     } }  It would be nice if the subscribe method returns the caller instance so we could  chain the subscribe ..  calls, but we work with what is provided for us. When the  previous code is run, a log similar to the following is printed in the console.  .. DEBUG c.a.b.c.j.FilterCharProcessor - Element 149 discarded. INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: > INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: B INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: 4 INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: Z  547   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: * INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: o DEBUG c.a.b.c.j.FilterCharProcessor - Element 141 discarded. INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: 4 DEBUG c.a.b.c.j.FilterCharProcessor - Element 142 discarded. INFO  c.a.b.c.j.CharPrinter - Result: Q DEBUG c.a.b.c.j.FilterCharProcessor - Element 132 discarded. ..  The example uses an infinite IntStream to generate elements to be published,   processed, and consumed. This leads to the execution program running forever, so you  have to stop it manually. Another consequence of this is that the onComplete   methods  will never be called. If we want to use them, we have to make sure the number of items  being published is a finite one.  The support for reactive streams is thin in the JDK, even in version 11, released   September 23, 2018. It was expected that more useful classes would be added in versions  following Java 9, but apparently Oracle is focused on other aspects, such as reorganizing  the module structure and deciding how to better monetize usage of the JDK, because  two releases after there’s still nothing new on the reactive front. That is why the next  section covers a short example of reactive programming done with the Project Reactor  library.   Reactive Streams Technology Compatibility Kit When building applications that use reactive streams a lot of things can go wrong. To  make sure that you are building a proper reactive application, you can use the Reactive  Streams Technology Compatibility Kit project  also known as TCK  to write tests.  This library contains classes that can test reactive implementations against the reactive  streams specifications. TCK is intended to verify the interfaces contained in Java 9  under  java.util.concurrent.Flow.*  and for some reason the team that created the library  decided to use TestNG as a testing library. The project sources are available on GitHub at  https:  github.com reactive-streams reactive-streams-jvm tree master   tck- flow, which contains four classes that have to be implemented to provide their   548    Flow.Publisher, Flow.Subscriber, Flow.Processor implementations for the test  harness to validate. The four classes are  Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework                  FlowPublisherVerification tests Publisher implementations.  FlowSubscriberWhiteboxVerification is used for whitebox testing  Subscriber implementations and Subscription instances.  FlowSubscriberBlackboxVerification is used for blackbox testing  Subscriber implementations and Subscription instances.  IdentityFlowProcessorVerification tests Processor  implementations.  To make the purpose of each test clear, the library test methods names follow this   pattern: TYPE_spec_DESC where TYPE is one of required, optional, stochastic, or  untested, which refers to the importance of the rule being tested, the number signs in  spec represent the rule number with the first one being 1 for Publisher instances  and the 2 for Subscribers and the DESC is a short explanation of the test purpose.  Let’s see how we could test the IntPublisher that we defined previously. For this,   we’ll modify this class to allow the class to use a limited IntStream as a source.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import java.util.Random; import java.util.concurrent.Flow; import java.util.concurrent.SubmissionPublisher; import java.util.stream.IntStream;  public class IntPublisher implements Flow.Publisher  {     private static final Random random = new Random  ;     protected final IntStream intStream;      public IntPublisher int limit  {          intStream = limit == 0 ? IntStream.generate    -> random.  nextInt 150   :                  IntStream.generate    -> random.nextInt 150  .limit 30 ;     }     ... }  549   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  We also need to provide access to the stream source of the IntStream so we can use  it in our test. Now let’s test our publisher by implementing the FlowPublisherVerificat ion .  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.jdkstreams;  import org.reactivestreams.tck.TestEnvironment; import org.reactivestreams.tck.flow.FlowPublisherVerification; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.util.concurrent.Flow;  public class IntPublisherTest extends FlowPublisherVerification  {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger FilterCharProcessor.class ;      public IntPublisherTest   {         super new TestEnvironment 300  ;     }      @Override     public Flow.Publisher  createFlowPublisher final long elements  {         return new IntPublisher 30  {             @Override              public void subscribe Flow.Subscriber    subscriber  {                  intStream.forEach subscriber::onNext ;                 subscriber.onComplete  ;             }         };     }      @Override     public Flow.Publisher  createFailedFlowPublisher   {         return new IntPublisher 0  {             @Override              public void subscribe Flow.Subscriber    subscriber  {  550   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework                  subscriber.onError new RuntimeException                      "There be dragons!"  ;             }         };     } }  To make it clear, a Publisher implementation might not pass all the tests, because   of design decisions that are specific to the application you are building. In our case,  the IntPublisher is simplistic; and when running the createFlowPublisher method  of all the executed tests, not many of them pass and most are ignored, as depicted in  Figure 12-5.  Figure 12-5.  Test NG Reactive Publisher  The reason tests do not pass or are ignored is that the purpose of our   implementation does not match those specific tests  e.g., maySupportMultiSubscribe,  maySignalLessThanRequestedAndTerminateSubscription, and mustSignalOn  MethodsSequentially .  551   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  We can test the processor and subscriber that we defined in the previous section by   extending the testing classes, but I’ll leave that as an exercise to you, because there is one  more interesting thing I would like to cover in this chapter.   Using Project Reactor As I’ve mentioned, the JDK support for reactive programming is scarce. Publishers,  processors, and subscribers should function asynchronously and all that behavior must  be implemented by the developer, which can be a bit of a pain. The only thing that the  JDK is suitable for at the moment is providing a common interface between all the other  already existing implementations. And there are a lot of them, providing a lot more  useful classes for more specialized reactive components and utility methods to create  and connect them easier. The one I personally fancy the most as a Spring aficionado is  Project Reactor, the same one favored by the Spring development team.  Project Reactor is one of the first libraries for reactive programming and its classes   provide a non-blocking stable foundation with efficient demand management for  building reactive applications. It works with Java 8, but does provide adapter classes for  JDK9 reactive streams classes that can be used within a JDK 11 project as well. Project  Reactor is suitable for microservices applications and provides a lot more classes  designed to make programming reactive application more practical than the JDK  does. Project Reactor provides two main publisher implementations:  reactor.core. publisher.Mono  which is a reactive stream publisher limited to publishing zero or one  element and reactor.core.publisher.Flux , which is a reactive stream publisher  with basic flow operators.  The advantage of using Project Reactor is that we have a lot more classes and   methods to work with. There are static factories that can create publishers and methods  that allow operations to be chained way more easily.  The Project Reactor team did not like the name Processor, so the intermediary   components are called operators.  in Figure 12-6 .3  If you look in the official documentation, you will most likely encounter the schema   3 Image source: Project Reactor Public API JavaDoc http:  projectreactor.io docs core  release api reactor core  publisher Flux.html  552   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  Figure 12-6.  Project Reactor Flux Publisher implementation  Figure 12-6 is an abstract schema of how the Flux publisher works. It emits elements,   throws exceptions, and completes when there are no more elements to publish. The  Project Reactor team found a prettier way to draw it.  The drawing for the Mono implementation is similar  see http:  projectreactor.  io docs core release api reactor core publisher Mono.html .  But let’s put that aside and look at a few code samples. Creating Flux instances is   very easy using the multiple utility methods in this class. But before starting to publish  elements, let’s design a general subscriber that does nothing else than print values,  because we need it to make sure our Flux publisher actually works.  To write a subscriber using Project Reactor API, you have multiple options. You can   implement the org.reactivestreams.Subscriber  directly.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.reactor;  import org.reactivestreams.Subscriber; import org.reactivestreams.Subscription; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  public class GenericSubscriber  implements Subscriber  {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger GenericSubscriber.class ;     private Subscription subscription;     @Override  553   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework      public void onSubscribe Subscription subscription  {         if  this.subscription == null  {             this.subscription = subscription;             this.subscription.request 1 ;         } else {             subscription.cancel  ;         }     }      @Override     public void onNext T element  {         log.info "consumed {} ", element ;         subscription.request 1 ;     }      @Override     public void onError Throwable t  {         log.error "Unexpected issue!", t ;     }      @Override     public void onComplete   {         log.info "All done!" ;     } }  But, this can be avoided by either implementing reactor.core.CoreSubscriber ,   the reactor base interface for subscribers, or even better, by extending  BaseSubscriber  class, which provides basic subscriber functionality. The behavior  of subscriber typical methods can be modified by overriding methods with then same  name, but prefixed with hook. In the next code snippet, you can see how easy it is to write  a subscriber using Project Reactor.  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.reactor;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import reactor.core.publisher.BaseSubscriber;  554   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  public class GenericSubscriber  extends BaseSubscriber  {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger GenericSubscriber.class ;  Ta, da! Now we have a subscriber class, let’s create a reactive publisher that serves   integers from an infinite integer stream to use an instance of this class.      @Override     protected void hookOnNext T value  {         log.info "consumed {} ", value ;         super.hookOnNext value ;     } }  package com.apress.bgn.ch12.reactor;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;  import java.util.Random; import java.util.stream.Stream;  public class ReactorDemo {      private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger ReactorDemo.  class ;      private static final Random random = new Random  ;      public static void main String... args  {         Flux  intFlux = Flux.fromStream                  Stream.generate    -> random.nextInt 150            ;          intFlux.subscribe new GenericSubscriber    ;     } }  555   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  If you run the code, you see that all the generated integer values are printed. A Flux   can be created from a multiple of sources, including arrays and other publishers. And  for special situations, to avoid returning a null value, an empty Flux can be created by  calling the empty   method.  String[] names = {"Joy", "John", "Anemona", "Takeshi"}; Flux.fromArray names .subscribe new GenericSubscriber    ;  Flux  intFlux = Flux.empty  ; intFlux.subscribe new GenericSubscriber    ;  But the most awesome method is named just ..  and it is provided for Flux   and Mono both. It takes one or more values and returns a publisher, a Flux or a Mono,  depending on the type being called on.  Flux  dummyStr = Flux.just "one", "two", "three" ; Flux  dummyInt = Flux.just 1,2,3 ;  Mono  one = Mono.just 1 ; Mono  empty = Mono.empty  ;  Another method that you might find useful is concat  , which allows us to   concatenate two Flux instances.  String[] names = {"Joy", "John", "Anemona", "Takeshi"}; Flux  namesFlux = Flux.fromArray names ;   String[] names2 = {"Hanna", "Eugen", "Anthony", "David"}; Flux  names2Flux = Flux.fromArray names2 ; Flux  combined = Flux.concat namesFlux, names2Flux ; combined.subscribe new GenericSubscriber    ;  And another thing that you might like, remember how the IntPublisher class had to  be slowed down using a Thread.sleep 1000  call? With Flux you do not need to do that,  because there are two utility methods that combined lead to the same behavior.  Flux  infiniteFlux = Flux.fromStream        Stream.generate    -> random.nextInt 150    ;  556   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  Flux  delay = Flux.interval Duration.ofSeconds 1  ; Flux  delayedInfiniteFlux = infiniteFlux.zipWith delay,  s,l  -> s ; delayedInfiniteFlux.subscribe new GenericSubscriber    ;  The interval ..  method creates a publisher that emits long values starting with 0    incrementing at specified time intervals on the global timer. It receives an argument of  type Duration. In the previous example, seconds were used. The zipWith ..  method  zips the Flux instance received as a parameter. The zip operation is a specific stream  operation that translates as both publishers emitting one element and combining these  elements using a java.util.function.BiFunction . In our case, the function  discards the seconds element, and returns the elements of the calling stream slowed  down by the generated seconds of the stream given as an argument.  The good part about the components provided by Project Reactor is that they return   mostly the same type of objects they are being called on and this means they can be  easily chained. A reactive piece of code equivalent to the previously JDK-based example  can be written with reactor API as follows.  Flux  infiniteFlux = Flux.fromStream                  Stream.generate    -> random.nextInt 150            ;  Flux  delay = Flux.interval Duration.ofSeconds 1  ; Flux  delayedInfiniteFlux =              infiniteFlux.zipWith delay,  s, l  -> s ;  delayedInfiniteFlux      .filter element ->  element >= 0 && element < 127        .map item -> {           if  item % 2 == 0 && item >= 98 && item <= 122  {                item -= 32;           }      return item; }       .map element ->  char  element.intValue         .subscribe new GenericSubscriber    ;  557   Chapter 12    the publish subsCribe Framework  Most functions that you remember from the Stream API have been implemented for  a reactive usage in Project Reactor, so if this code seems familiar, this is the reason why.  As proven with the code samples in this section, programming using reactive streams   is way more practical using the Project Reactor API, so if you are ever in need of a  reactive library you could consider this one first. You can find the official documentation  at http:  projectreactor.io docs core milestone reference , it’s good and full of  examples. If ever Oracle decides to provide their own rich API for programming reactive  applications using reactive streams, they will probably be too late to the table.   Summary Reactive programming is not an easy topic, but it does seem to be the future of  programming. What you have to keep in mind is that reactive implementations are quite  useless with implementations that are not reactive. I mean, there is no use to design and  use reactive components with non-reactive components, because you might introduce  failure points and slow things down. For example, if you are using an Oracle database,  there is no point in defining a repository class that returns elements using reactive  streams, because an Oracle database does not support reactive access. So you add a  reactive layer that provides extra implementation, because there are no real benefits in  this case. But if your database of choice is MongoDB, you can use reactive programming  confidently, because MongoDB databases support reactive access. Also, if you are  building a web application with a ReactJS or angular interface, you can design your  controller classes to provide data reactively to be displayed by the interface.  This chapter covered  reactive programming  the behavior of reactive streams  JDK reactive streams support                  the Reactive Streams Technology Compatibility Kit     Project Reactor components  558   CHAPTER 13  Garbage Collection  When executing Java code, objects are created, used and discarded repeatedly from  memory. The process through which unused Java objects are discarded is called  memory management, but is most commonly known as garbage collection  GC .  garbage collection was mentioned in Chapter 5 as it was needed for explaining the  difference between primitive and reference types, but in this chapter we go deep   under the hood of the JVM to resolve yet another mystery of a running Java application.  When the Java garbage collector does its job properly, the memory is cleaned up,   before new objects are created and it does not fill up, so you could say that the memory  allocated to a program is recycled. Programs of low complexity, like the ones we’ve  been writing so far do not require that much memory to function, but depending on  their design  remember recursivity?  they could end up using more memory than it  is available to them. In Java, the garbage collector runs automatically. In more low  level languages, like C there is no automatic memory management, and the developer  is responsible for writing the code to allocate memory as needed, and deallocate it  when it is no longer needed. Although it seems practical to have automatic memory  management, the garbage collector can be a problem if managed incorrectly. So this  chapter provides enough information about the garbage collector to make sure it is used  wisely, and when problems arise, at least you have a good place to start solving them. Although some ways to tune the garbage collector will be covered in this chapter  introduced, keep in mind that garbage collection tuning should not be necessary, a  program should be written in such a way that creates only objects that are needed to  perform its function and references are managed correctly, estimations should be done  before the application is put into production and the maximum amount of memory  needed by it should be known and configured before that. If the memory allocated to a  Java program is not enough, there is usually something rotten in the implementation.    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I. Cosmina, Java for Absolute Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3778-6_13  559   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion   Garbage Collection Basics The Java automatic garbage collection is one of the major features of the of the Java  Programming language. The JVM is a virtual machine used to execute Java programs.  As the Java programs uses resources of the system the JVM is running on top of, it has to  have a way to release those resources safely. This job is done by the garbage collector.   To understand the garbage collector, we have to take a look at the JVM architecture.   Oracle Hotspot JVM Architecture Over the years, some big companies have produced their own variations of the JVM    e.g., IBM  and now that Java is moving into the module age and rapid delivery style,  more and more companies appear that maintain a specific version of the JDK JVM    e.g., Azul , because migration to 9+ is difficult for big applications with legacy  dependencies. Also, another important economic factor here is that Java is paid software  as of January 1, 2019, and developers have to pay for the software they have developed,  which many are going to call bait and switch as Oracle first said, Here it is free now use  it, and then, Now that you have developed your Java apps, you have to pay us. If you  think about it, it is the same thing as buying the ground your house is built on, and the  bricks, and everything else. Because the only thing that is yours when building a Java  application is the application purpose and the design; everything you are using to build  it is part of the JDK, which belongs to Oracle.  Still, Oracle’s HotSpot is by far the most commonly used JVM when it comes to   garbage collection. This JVM provides a mature set of garbage collection options. Its  architecture is depicted in Figure 13-1.  560   Figure 13-1.  Oracle HotSpot JVM Architecture  The heap memory area is managed by the garbage collector, and is split into multiple   zones. Objects are moved between these zones until being discarded. The zones are  depicted in Figure 13-2 for old-fashioned garbage collector and the new style of garbage  collector that follows the model of the current default garbage collector used by the JDK,  the G1GC, introduced in JDK 8.  Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  561   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  Figure 13-2.  The heap structure  The G1GC is a next-generation garbage collector designed for machines with a lot of  resources, which is why its approach to the partitioning of the heap is different. Its heap  is partitioned into a set of equal-sized heap regions, each a contiguous range of virtual  memory. Certain region sets are assigned the same roles  Eden, survivor, old  as in the older  collectors, but there is not a fixed size for them. This provides greater flexibility in memory  usage. You can read more about the different types of garbage collectors in the next section,  for now the focus remain on the heap memory and its zones that are called generations.  When an application is running, objects created by it are stored in the young  generation area. When an object is created it starts its life in a subdivision of this  generation called the Eden space. When the Eden space is filled, this triggers a   minor garbage collection minor GC run  that cleans up this area of unreferenced  objects, and moves referenced objects to the first survivor space  S0 . The next time  the Eden space is filled, another minor GC run is triggered, which again deletes  unreferenced objects, and referenced objects are moved to the next survivor space  S1 .  The objects in S0 have been there for a minor GC run, so their age is incremented and  they are moved to S1, so S0 and the Eden can be cleaned up. At the next minor GC run,  562   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  the operation is repeated again, but this time referenced objects are saved into the empty  S0 and the older objects form S1, have their age incremented and moved here as well,  so the S1 and Eden can be cleaned up. After the objects in survivor space reach a certain  age, they are moved to the old generation space during minor GC runs.  The previous steps are depicted in Figure 13-3, and the o1 and o2 objects age until   they are moved to the old generation area.  Figure 13-3.  Minor GC runs in the young generation space  563   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  Minor GC collections happen until the old generation space is filled, which is when a  major garbage collection major GC run  is triggered. That deletes unreferenced objects,  compacts the memory, and moves objects around so that the empty memory left is one  big compact space. The minor garbage collection event is a stop the world event, this  process basically takes over the run of the application and pauses its execution so it can  free the memory. As the young generation space is small in size  as you see in the next  section , the application pause is usually negligible. If no memory can be reclaimed from  the young generation area after a minor GC run takes place, a major GC run is triggered. The permanent generation area is reserved for JVM metadata such as classes and   methods. This area is cleaned too from time to time to remove classes that are no longer  used in the application. The cleanup of this area is triggered when there is no more  available memory left in the heap.  The garbage collection process described up to this paragraph is specific to   generational garbage collectors, such as the G1GC; but before JDK 8, garbage collection  was done using an older garbage collector that uses an algorithm called Concurrent  Mark Sweep. This type of garbage collector runs in parallel with the application marking  used and unused zones of memory. Then it would delete unreferenced objects and  would compact the memory into a contiguous zone by moving objects around. This  process is inefficient and time consuming. Because as more and more objects were  created, the garbage collection takes more and more time to be performed. But as most  objects are short-lived, this is not really a problem. So the CMS garbage collector was OK  for a while.  The G1GC has a similar approach, but after the mark phase is finished, G1 focuses on  regions that are mostly empty to recover as much unused memory as possible. That is why  this garbage collector is also called garbage-first. G1 also uses a pause prediction model to  decide how many memory regions can be processed based on the pause time set for the  application. Objects from the processed region are copied to a single region of the heap,  thus realizing a memory compaction at the same time. Also G1GC does not have a fixed  size for the eden and survivor spaces, it decides their size after every minor GC run.   How Many Garbage Collectors Are There? The Oracle HotSpot JVM provides the following types of garbage collectors:      serial collector: All garbage collection events are conducted serially  in one thread. Memory compaction happens after each garbage  collection.  564   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion     parallel collector: Multiple threads are used for minor garbage   collection. A single thread is used for a major garbage collection and  Old Generation compaction.     CMS  Concurrent Mark Sweep : Multiple threads are used for   minor garbage collection using the same algorithm as the parallel  GC. Major garbage collection is multithreaded, but CMS runs  concurrently alongside application processes to minimize stop the  world events. No memory compaction is done. This type of garbage  collector is suitable for applications requiring shorter garbage  collection pauses and that can afford to share processor resources  with the garbage collector while the application is running. This was  the default garbage collector until Java 8, when G1 was introduced  officially as default.     G1  garbage first : Introduced in Oracle JDK 7, update 4, was   designed to permanently replace the CMS GC and is suitable for  applications that can operate concurrently with CMS collector, need  memory compaction, need more predictable GC pause durations,  and do not require a much larger heap. The G1 collector is a server-  style garbage collector, targeted for multiprocessor machines with  large memories, and considering that most laptops now have at  least eight cores and 16 GB RAM it is suitable for them. G1 has both  concurrent  runs along with application threads—e.g., refinement,  marking, cleanup  and parallel  multithreaded—e.g., stop the world   phases. Full garbage collections are still single threaded, but if tuned  properly your applications should avoid full garbage collections.     Epsilon no-op collector: Introduced in Java 11, this type of collector  is a dummy GC that does not recycle or clean up the memory. When  the heap is full, the JVM shuts down. This type of collector can be  used for performance tests, for memory allocation analysis, VM  interface testing, and extremely short-lived jobs and applications  that are very limited when it comes to memory usage and developers  must estimate the application memory footprint as precisely   as possible.  565   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  OK, I’ve listed the garbage collector types, but how do we know which is the one   used by our local JVM? There is more than one way. The simplest way is to add the  -verbose:gc as a VM option when running a simple main class. Using Java 11 JDK,  without any other configuration will print this in the console.  [0.016s][info][gc] Using G1  So it’s clear; G1 garbage collector is used. We can see the details of this garbage   collector by adding another VM option: -Xlog:gc*1.

The eden and the young generation differ; the G1 uses 4096 KB  for the young generation, whereas the CMS requires 78656 KB  a lot more .  The most interesting is the Epislon garbage collector, because as expected, it does   not have a heap split into generation areas, as this type of garbage collector does not  perform garbage collection at all. The TLAB is an acronym for thread local allocation  buffer, which is the memory area where objects are stored. Only bigger objects are stored  outside of TLABs. The TLABs are dynamically resized during the execution for each  thread individually. So, if a thread allocates very much, the new TLABs that it gets from  the heap increase in size. The minimum size of a TLAB can be controlled using two VM  options: -XX:MinTLABSize.  For the small empty class that we ran with the previous VM options, this output is not  really relevant, but you can play with these options when running the code from the next  sections, because that is when the statistics printed here have some relevance.  Also, there is a VM option named -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags that can be used   when a class is run to depict configurations of the garbage collector: the number of  threads it uses, heap size, and so on.  -XX:G1ConcRefinementThreads=8 -XX:GCDrainStackTargetSize=64 -XX:InitialHeapSize=268435456 -XX:MaxHeapSize=4294967296 -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=251658240 -XX:+SegmentedCodeCache -XX:+UseCompressedClassPointers -XX:+UseCompressedOops -XX: +UseG1GC  Most of these VM options have obvious names that allow a developer to infer   what they are used for. Also, there is the official documentation from Oracle. If you  ever need to dissect the Oracle memory management, the article at www.oracle.com  technetwork java javase tech index-jsp-136373.html is very good.  570   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion   Working with GC from the Code For most applications garbage collection is not something a developer must really take  into account. The JVM starts a GC thread that does its job without hindering the execution  of the application  usually . But for developers who want to have more than Java basic  skills, understanding how the Java garbage collection works and how can it be tuned  is a must. The first thing that a developer must accept about Java garbage collection is  that it cannot be controlled at runtime. As you see in the next section, there is a way to  suggest the JVM that some memory cleaning is necessary, but there is no guarantee that  a memory cleaning be performed. The only thing that can be done is specify some code  to be run when an object is discarded.   Using the finalize   Method Every Java class is automatically a subclass of the JDK java.lang.Object class. This  class is at the root of the JDK hierarchy and is the root of all classes in an application.  It provides a few useful methods that can be extended or overwritten to implement  behavior specific to the subclass. The equals  , hashcode   and toString   were  already mentioned. The finalize   method was deprecated in Java 9, but it was not  removed from the JDK. This method is called by the garbage collector when there are no  longer any references to that object in the code. Before we move forward, let’s look at the  following piece of code.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13;  import com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.NameGenerator; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.Random;  public class Main {     private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger Main.class ;     private static NameGenerator nameGenerator = new NameGenerator  ;     private static final Random rnd = new Random  ;  571   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      public static void main String... args  {         while  true  {             genSinger  ;          }     }      private static void genSinger   {         Singer s = new Singer nameGenerator.genName  ,             rnd.nextDouble  , LocalDate.now   ;         log.info "JVM created: {}", s.getName   ;     } }  The action performed by the code should be clear, even without knowing how the   what the NameGenerator or the Singer class look like. The main method calls the  genSinger   method in an infinite loop. This means that an infinite number of Singer  instances is created. So, what happens? Will the code run? For how long? If you were able  to reply these questions in your mind, my work here is complete. You can stop reading  the book now.  In Chapter 5, there were some figures representing the memory contents for a small  program. Figure 13-4 represents how the Java heap and stack memory might look during  the execution of the previous program.  572   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  Figure 13-4.  Java stack and heap memory during execution of the Main.class  Of course, only one genSinger   call was represented and only one Singer instance.   When the main ..  method is called, references to the static instances are created,  which will be relevant to the program until the end of its execution. Then, genSinger    methods is called repeatedly. Each of these methods has its own stack where it saves  references to the objects created within the context of that method, in this case the  Singer instance. This reference is used to print the name of the Singer instance that  was created in the body of this method. Then the method terminates without returning  the reference. This means that the instance that was created is no longer necessary,  as it was created to be used only in the context of this method. When the execution of  the genSinger   method ends, the reference to the Singer instance is discarded from  the stack. The Singer instance still exists, in the heap memory, but can no longer be  accessed from the program, thus it is no longer necessary to it. It now keeps a memory  block occupied with its own contents, its references to other instances, in this case, a  String, a Double and a LocalDate.  Considering that the genString   method is called an infinite number of times  in   Figure 13-4 this is represented with the  *n  , more Singer instances are created, which  keep the memory occupied. At some point, the program becomes unable to create  others because there is no memory available.  573   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  This is where the garbage collector comes into the picture. The Singer instances that  are no longer being referenced from the program  and thus unreachable  are considered  garbage. Now you know where the name came from. These instances are no longer  necessary and the memory can be safely cleaned up. The garbage collector is a cleanup  thread that runs in parallel with the main execution thread. It occasionally deletes the  unreferenced objects from the heap memory. And because the finalize   method is  still available for use, we overwrite it for the Singer type to print a log message so that  we can see when the garbage collector is destroying an instance, because before deleting  an object from the heap memory the finalize   method of the object is called. The  following code snippet depicts the Singer instance.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.io.*; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.Objects;      private String name;     private Double rating;     private LocalDate birthDate;      public String getName   {         return name;     }  574  public class Singer implements Serializable {     private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger Singer.class ;     private final long birthtime;      public Singer String name, Double rating, LocalDate birthDate  {         this.name = name;         this.rating = rating;         this.birthDate = birthDate;         this.birthtime = System.nanoTime  ;     }   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      @Override     protected void finalize   throws Throwable {         try {             long deathtime = System.nanoTime  ;             long lifespan =   deathtime - birthtime    1_000_000_000;             log.info "GC Destroyed: {} after {} seconds",  name, lifespan ;         } finally {             super.finalize  ;         }     } }  The birthtime field was added to calculate the time that passes between when an   instance constructor is called and the time that the garbage collector calls the finalize    method; basically we are calculating the lifespan of the instance. As the time is counted in  nanoseconds, we are dividing the difference by 109 to get the time in seconds.  The code sample used in this section gives the garbage collector a lot of work to do,   as every Singer instance being created is being used very little before being discarded. If  you run the code you will see a lot of log messages in the console, first a lot of messages  about objects being created, but if you wait, messages about objects being discarded will   appear as well. All output is directed to a file, because the IntelliJ IDEA console is based  on a buffer that resets from time to time to prevent the editor from crashing. You have  to stop the program manually, because the while true  loop never ends, because its  condition never evaluates to false. After you stopped the program, you notice a log file  at the following location:  chapter13 out gc.log. If you don’t, modify the IntelliJ IDEA  launcher for this class, add the -Dlogback.configurationFile=chapter13 src main  resources logback.xml VM option, and run it again.  The gc.log contents should look a lot like the snippet depicted next.

When you have the file, you can open it and start analyzing its contents. But because   IntelliJ might not open such a big file, try to open it with a specialized text editor like  Notepad++ or Sublime. Or, if you use a Unix Linux operating system, open your console  and use the grep command like this:  grep -a 'seconds' gc.log  This displays all log entries printed when the finalize   method is called. Then, you   can select the name of an instance can do something like this:  $ grep -a 'Lybhpococssuoz' gc.log INFO c.a.b.c.Main - JVM created: Lybhpococssuoz INFO c.a.b.c.Singer - GC Destroyed: Lybhpococssuoz after 7 seconds  576   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  The time it takes for a Singer instance to be deleted from the heap varies, and this   is because the GC is called randomly, the developer has no control over it. There is a  way to explicitly request garbage collection to be done, well two ways. You can call the  following.  System.gc   or Runtime.getRuntime  .gc  ;  This doesn’t mean that the GC immediately start cleaning up the memory; it is more   like a suggestion to the JVM that it should make an effort to recycle unused objects and  reclaim unused memory, because it is needed.  Now, back to the finalize   method. It was marked as deprecated in Java 9. This   method is meant to be overridden by classes that handle resources that are stored  outside of the heap. The example is the I O handling classes used to read resources  as files or URLs and databases. The finalize   would be called by the JVM when an  object can no longer be accessed by any alive thread of the running application to make  sure that those resources were released and available for other external and unrelated  programs to use.  **  in older versions of apache tomcat  a Java based web server , there was  a bug on Windows related to release of resources. When the server crashed or  stopped, it couldn’t be restarted because some of its log files were not released  properly, and the new server instance could not get access to them to start writing  the new log entries.  With the introduction of the java.lang. AutoCloseable interface in JDK 1.7,   the finalize   method became less and less used. Also, another problem with this  method is that the JVM cannot guarantee which thread call this method for any  given object. So any thread that has access to it can call it, and we might end up with  resources being released while the object is still needed. Also, what happens if the  custom implementation is not correct, throws exceptions or does not releases resources  properly? The finalize   method should be called only once by the JVM, but this  cannot be guaranteed. Another downside is that finalize   calls, are not automatically  chained, so an implementation of a finalize   method, must always explicitly call the   finalize   method of the superclass. And another one for you: once finalize      577   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  was called, there is no way to stop the method from executing or undo its effect, so you are  basically left with a reference to an object that no longer has access to its resources. As you  probably figured out by now, there is a lot of freedom given to the developer when it comes  to implementing this method, and this means there is a lot of room for errors to happen.  This is why the finalization mechanism in Java is flawed and was deprecated in JDK  9 to discourage its use. Improper finalize   implementations could lead to: memory  leaks  memory contents are not discarded , deadlocks  resource is blocked by two  processes  and hangs process is in a waiting state it cannot go out of . But, in order to  help with memory management the java.lang.ref.Cleaner class was introduced. But  before getting into that, I must show you how to check out the status of your memory  programmatically.   Heap Memory Statistics The Runtime class is useful when trying to interact with the internals of the JVM while  a program is running. Its gc   method can be called to suggest to the JVM that the  memory should be cleaned. A few chapters ago we used methods in this class to start  processes from the Java code. There are three methods in this class that are useful to see  the status of the memory assigned to a Java program.          runtime.maxMemory   returns the maximum amount of memory the  JVM attempts to use for its heap, if needed. The value returned by this  method varies from machine to machine and is being set implicitly to  a quarter of the total existing RAM memory on the machine, unless  is set it is set explicitly by using the JVM option -Xmx followed by the  amount of memory,  e.g., -Xmx8G allows the JVM to use a maximum  of 8 GB of memory .  runtime.totalMemory   returns the total amount of memory of  the JVM. The value returned by this method varies from machine to  machine too and is implementation-dependent, unless explicitly set  by using the JVM option -Xms followed by the amount of memory   e.g., -Xms1G tells the JVM that is the initial size of its heap memory  should be 1 GB of memory .      runtime.freeMemory   returns an approximation of the amount of  free memory for the Java virtual machine.  578   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  Using the runtime.totalMemory   and the runtime.freeMemory   methods, we can  write some code to check how much of our memory is occupied at various times during  the execution of the program. For this we create a class named MemAudit that uses the  current logger to print memory values.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13.util;  import org.slf4j.Logger;  public class MemAudit {     private static final long MEGABYTE = 1024L * 1024L;     private static final Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime  ;      public static void printBusyMemory Logger log  {         long memory = runtime.totalMemory   - runtime.freeMemory  ;         log.info "Occupied memory: {} MB",  memory   MEGABYTE  ;     }      public static void printTotalMemory Logger log  {          log.info "Total Program memory: {} MB",  runtime.totalMemory     MEGABYTE  ;           log.info "Max Program memory: {} MB",  runtime.maxMemory   MEGABYTE  ;     } }  And the methods in this class are called during the execution of our program as it   follows.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13;  import com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.NameGenerator; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.Random; import static com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.MemAudit.printTotalMemory; import static com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.MemAudit.printBusyMemory;  579   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  public class Main {     private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger Main.class ;     private static NameGenerator nameGenerator = new NameGenerator  ;     private static final Random random = new Random  ;      public static void main String... args  {         printTotalMemory log ;         int count =0;         while  true  {              genSinger  ;              count++;              if  count % 1000 == 0  {                 printBusyMemory log ;              }          }     }      private static void genSinger   {         Singer s = new Singer nameGenerator.genName  ,            random.nextDouble  , LocalDate.now   ;         log.info "JVM created: {}", s.getName   ;     }  Now, after we delete the old log file, we should run it again, and leave it for a little   while. And because it is impossible again to see the output, we’ll use the grep method to  extract all lines containing the memory word, and the result should look quite similar to  the next listing.  $ grep -a 'memory' gc.log INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Total Program memory: 256 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Max Program memory: 4096 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 5 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 3 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 4 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 5 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 5 MB  }  580   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 4 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 4 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 7 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 8 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 8 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 9 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 7 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 3 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 15 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.Main - Occupied memory: 7 MB ...  The max memory is 4096MB, which means my machine has a total of 16 GB of   RAM, and the occupied memory is very little, not even close to the initial 256MB the  JVM is given to use. If we want to see real memory being occupied we can modify the  genSinger   method to return the created references and add them to a list.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13;  import com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.NameGenerator; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random;  import static com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.MemAudit.printBusyMemory; import static com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.MemAudit.printTotalMemory;  public class MemoryConsumptionDemo {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger MemoryConsumptionDemo.class ;     private static NameGenerator nameGenerator = new NameGenerator  ;     private static final Random random = new Random  ;  581   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      public static void main String... args  {         printTotalMemory log ;         List  singers = new ArrayList   ;         for  int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; ++i  {              singers.add genSinger   ;              if  i % 1000 == 0  {                 printBusyMemory log ;              }          }      }      private static Singer genSinger   {         Singer s = new Singer nameGenerator.genName  ,            random.nextDouble  , LocalDate.now   ;         log.info "JVM created: {}", s.getName   ;         return s;     } }  After running the program, we can actually see the memory being used increasing  gradually. A look in the log filtered magically by the grep command shows us that the  program keeps the memory occupied until its end, since the references now are saved in  to the List  instance.   $ grep -a 'memory' gc.log INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Total Program memory: 256 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Max Program memory: 4096 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 13 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 16 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 18 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 21 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 4 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 6 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 9 MB INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 12 MB INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 15 MB  582   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 17 MB INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 20 MB INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 23 MB INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 26 MB INFO c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 28 MB ...

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space         at chapter.thirteen com.apress.bgn.ch13.MemoryConsumptionDemo              .genSinger MemoryConsumptionDemo.java:64          at chapter.thirteen com.apress.bgn.ch13.MemoryConsumptionDemo              .main MemoryConsumptionDemo.java:55   Remember the value returned by the runtime.maxMemory  ? On my machine, it was   4096MB. If I look in the console, right before the exception, I will see the following.  INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 4094 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 4094 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 4095 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 4095 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.MemoryConsumptionDemo - Occupied memory: 4095 MB  So the JVM was struggling to create another Singer instance, but there was no more  memory left. The last value printed before the exception was 4095MB, which is 1 MB less  than 4096MB the maximum amount of memory that the JVM was allowed to use. So the  poor JVM crashed because there was no more heap memory available. If a program ever  ends like that, the problem is always in the design of the solution. Also the values for  total and maximum memory for the JVM can influence the behavior of the GC as well.  583   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  The -Xms and -Xmx are important because they decide the initial and the maximum  size of the heap memory. Configured properly they can increase performance, but when  unsuitable values are used they have the adverse effect. For example, never set an initial  size for the heap too small, because if there is not enough space to fit all objects created  by the application the JVM has to allocate more memory, rebuilding the heap basically.  So if this happens a few times during the application run, the overall time consumption  is affected. The maximum size for the heap is very important, allocating too little might  cause an  application crash, allocating too much might hinder other programs from  running. Deciding these values is usually done through repeated experiments and  starting with JDK 11, the new Epsilon garbage collector comes in handy for this purpose. If you want to learn more about GC tuning, the best documentation is the official one   at https:  docs.oracle.com javase 10 gctuning toc.htm.  So, now that you know what to expect from the GC, let’s look at other methods of   customizing its behavior so problems are avoided.   Using Cleaner After the finalize   method is taken out of the JDK, if needed, classes can be  developed to implement java.lang.AutoCloseable and provide an implementation  for the close   method and make sure you use your objects in a try-with-resources  statement. But if you want to avoid implementing the interface there is another way,  use a java.lang.ref.Cleaner object. This class can be instantiated and objects can be  registered to it together with an action to perform when the object is being discarded by  the garbage collector. Using a Cleaner instance, the previous code can be rewritten as  depicted in the next code listing.   package com.apress.bgn.ch13.cleaner;  import com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.NameGenerator; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.lang.ref.Cleaner; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.util.Random;  import static com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.MemAudit.printBusyMemory; import static com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.MemAudit.printTotalMemory;  584   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  public class CleanerDemo {      private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger CleanerDemo.  class ;      public static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create  ;     private static NameGenerator nameGenerator = new NameGenerator  ;      public static void main String... args  {         printTotalMemory log ;         int count = 0;         for  int i = 0; i < 100_000; ++i  {             genActor  ;             count++;             if  count % 1000 == 0  {                 printBusyMemory log ;                 System.gc  ;              }         }            filling memory with arrays of String to force GC to clean up   Actor objects          for  int i = 1; i <= 10_000; i++  {             String[] s = new String[10_000];             try {                 Thread.sleep 1 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {             }          }      }      private static Cleaner.Cleanable genActor   {         Actor a = new Actor nameGenerator.genName  , LocalDate.now   ;         log.info "JVM created: {}", a.getName   ;         Cleaner.Cleanable handle = cleaner.register a,            new ActorRunnable a.getName  , log  ;         return handle;     }  585   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      static class ActorRunnable implements Runnable {         private final String actorName;         private final Logger log;          public ActorRunnable String actorName, Logger log  {             this.actorName = actorName;             this.log = log;          }          @Override         public void run   {             log.info "GC Destroyed: {} ", actorName ;          }     } }  Because we wanted to make it easier for you to browse the code, as all these sources   are part of the same project, we are using here a class modelling an Actor instead of a  Singer, but no worries, the implementation is quite similar. The Cleaner instance has a  method named register ..  that is called to register the action to be performed when  the object is cleaned. The action to be performed is specified as a Runnable instance,  and the decision to create a class by implementing it, ActorRunnable in this example,  was taken so we could save the name of the object to be destroyed into a field, without  keeping a reference to the object to be destroyed; otherwise, the Cleaner.Cleanable  handle would not be used by the GC during the execution of the program, as the object  would appear as if it still had references to it.  The cleaner.register ..  method returns an instance of type Cleaner.Cleanable   that explicitly performs the action by calling the clean   method. If you run the  preceding code, the printed log would look similar to this:  INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - Total Program memory: 256 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - Max Program memory: 4096 MB INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Vgyfr uayznrtu INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Cowplkbzshwudhb INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Ijwqydlvzldequd INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Jfnjgopzmrdacim INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Tnnwizmtipgmvsz  586   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Wffuzkzrhrfjrsj INFO  c.a.b.c.c.CleanerDemo - JVM created: Vlfsvprbtfytdzm ...

So, the same result as using finalize   was obtained, but without implementing   a deprecated method. As a good practice to take from here, if you are writing your  application using Java 9+, avoid using finalize  , because this method is clearly on the  path of being removed. Use Cleaner and you might have less of a hassle when upgrading  the Java version your application is using.   Preventing GC from Deleting an Object In the two previous sections, we focused on objects that are eligible for garbage  collection. But in an application, there are objects that should not be discarded while the  program runs, because they are needed. The most obvious references in our classes that  were discarded only at the end of the execution were the static fields, and they are final,  so they cannot be reinitialized.  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger CleanerDemo. class ; public static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create  ; private static NameGenerator nameGenerator = new NameGenerator  ; private static final Random random = new Random  ;  587   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  The problem with these static values is that they occupy the memory. What if you   need a big Map that contains a dictionary that is not needed when the application starts?  To solve this, enter the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern is a specific   design of a class that ensures the class can only be instantiated once during the execution  of the program. This is done by hiding the constructor  declare it private , and declaring  a private static reference of the class type and a static method to return it. There is more  than one way to write a class according to the Singleton pattern, but the most common  way is depicted in the next code listing.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13.util;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;  public final class SingletonDictionary {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger SingletonDictionary.class ;      private static SingletonDictionary instance = new SingletonDictionary  ;      private Map   dictionary = new HashMap   ;      private SingletonDictionary  {            init dictionary          log.info "Starting to create dictionary: {}", System.  currentTimeMillis   ;          final NameGenerator keyGen = new NameGenerator 20 ;         final NameGenerator valGen = new NameGenerator 200 ;         for  int i = 0; i < 100_000; ++i  {             dictionary.put keyGen.genName  , valGen.genName   ;          }         log.info "Done creating dictionary: {}", System.currentTimeMillis   ;     }  588       public synchronized static SingletonDictionary getInstance  {         return instance;  Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      } }  In the code, we simulated a dictionary with 100,000 entries, all generated by  a modified version of the NameGenerator class. Log messages were printed in its  constructor to be really obvious when the instance is created. There are four things you  have to remember about the Singleton pattern.     The constructor must be private, as it should not be called outside      The class must contain a static reference to an object of its type that   can be initialized in place by calling the private constructor.     A method to retrieve this instance must be defined, so it has to be   the class.  static.     The method to retrieve the static instance also has to be synchronized   so no two threads can call it at the same and gain access to the  instance, because the core idea of the Singleton pattern is to allow the  class to be instantiated only once during the duration of the execution  of the program and ensure that no concurrent access is allowed, as it  might lead to unexpected behavior. Also, there is an implementation  version that initializes the instance in the method that retrieves it, so  concurrent access might lead to more than one instance being created.  In a singleton class, a static reference to an instance is created and this static   reference prevents the garbage collector from cleaning up this instance during the  execution of the program. To test this, we’ll write a main class that declares a Cleaner  instance, and register a Cleanable for the SingletonDictionary instance. The main  method creates a lot of String arrays to fill up the memory to convince the GC to delete  the SingletonDictionary instance, and we’ll even set its own reference to it to null.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13;  import com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.SingletonDictionary; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  589   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  import java.lang.ref.Cleaner;  public class SingletonDictionaryDemo {     public static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create  ;     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger SingletonDictionaryDemo.class ;      public static void main String... args  {         log.info "Testing SingletonDictionary..." ;            filling memory with arrays of String to force GC         for  int i = 1; i <= 10_000; i++  {             String[] s = new String[10_000];             try {                 Thread.sleep 1 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {             }          }          SingletonDictionary singletonDictionary =                SingletonDictionary.getInstance  ;          cleaner.register singletonDictionary,   -> {             log.info "Cleaned up the dictionary!" ;         } ;            we delete the reference         singletonDictionary = null;            filling memory with arrays of String to force GC         for  int i = 1; i <= 10_000; i++  {             String[] s = new String[10_000];             try {                 Thread.sleep 1 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {             }         }         log.info "DONE." ;     } }  590   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  If we run the code and expect to see the "Cleaned up the dictionary!" message in   the console, we’re expecting in vain. That static reference in the SingletonDictionary  will not allow GC to touch that object until the program ends. The static reference that  we have in class SingletonDictionary is also called a strong reference, because it  prevents the object from being discarded from memory.   Using Weak References If there are strong references, we should be able to use weak references for objects that  we want cleaned, right? Right. In Java, there are three classes  that can be used to create   a reference to an object that does not protect that object from garbage collection. This  is useful for objects that are too big, and it makes it inefficient to keep them in memory.  With this kind of objects it is worth the cost of time consumed to be reinitialized, because  keeping them in memory would slow done the overall performance of the application.  The three classes are:              java.lang.ref.SoftReference : objects referred by these type  of references are cleared at the discretion of the garbage collector in  response to memory demand. Soft references are most often used to  implement memory-sensitive caches.  java.lang.ref.WeakReference : objects referred by these type of  references do not prevent their referents from being made finalizable,  finalized, and then reclaimed. Weak references are most often used  to implement canonicalizing mappings. Canonicalizing mapping  refers to containers where weak references can be kept in and can  be accessed by other objects, but their link to the container, does not  prevent them from being collected.  java.lang.ref.PhantomReference : objects referred by these type  of references are enqueued after the collector determines that their  referents may otherwise be reclaimed. Phantom references are most  often used to schedule post-mortem cleanup actions.  Our SingletonDictionary contains a Map  that is the big object stored in memory.   This map can be wrapped in a WeakReference, and we can write some logic that it should   591   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  be reinitialized if it is not there when accessed. Because we need to access the map, the  implementation changes a little, aside from wrapping the Map into a WeakReference. The  new class, named WeakDictionary, is depicted in the following code listing.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13.util;  import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  import java.lang.ref.WeakReference; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;  public class WeakDictionary {     private static final Logger log =         LoggerFactory.getLogger WeakDictionary.class ;     private static WeakDictionary instance = new WeakDictionary  ;     private WeakReference > dictionary;     private static Cleaner cleaner;      private WeakDictionary   {             cleaner = Cleaner.create  ;         dictionary = new WeakReference  initDictionary   ;      }  592      public synchronized String getExplanationFor Integer key  {         Map  dict = dictionary.get  ;         if  dict == null  {             dict = initDictionary  ;             dictionary = new WeakReference  dict ;             return dict.get key ;         } else {             return dict.get key ;         }     }      public synchronized static WeakDictionary getInstance   {         return instance;     }   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      private Map  initDictionary   {         Map  dict = new HashMap   ;          log.info "Starting to create dictionary: {}", System.  currentTimeMillis   ;          final NameGenerator keyGen = new NameGenerator 20 ;         final NameGenerator valGen = new NameGenerator 200 ;         for  int i = 0; i < 100_000; ++i  {             dict.put i, valGen.genName   ;         }          log.info "Done creating dictionary: {}", System.  currentTimeMillis   ;            cleaner.register dict,   -> log.info "Cleaned up the   dictionary!"  ;          return dict;     } }  The getExplanationFor accesses the map and gets the value corresponding a key.   But before doing that, we have to check if the Map is still there. This is done by calling the  get   method on the dictionary reference that is of type WeakReference<Map<Integer,  String>>. If the map was not collected by the GC, the key is extracted and returned;  otherwise, the Map is reinitialized and the weak reference is re-created.  The Cleaner instance was moved in the WeakDictionary class, and registered a   Cleanable for the Map so we can see the map being collected. So, how do we test this? In  a similar way we tested SingletonDictionary.  package com.apress.bgn.ch13;  import com.apress.bgn.ch13.util.WeakDictionary; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;  public class WeakDictionaryDemo {     private static final Logger log =        LoggerFactory.getLogger WeakDictionaryDemo.class ;  593   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion      public static void main String... args  {         log.info "Testing WeakDictionaryDemo..." ;            filling memory with arrays of String to force GC         for  int i = 1; i <= 10_000; i++  {             String[] s = new String[10_000];             try {                 Thread.sleep 1 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {             }          }         WeakDictionary weakDictionary = WeakDictionary.getInstance  ;            filling memory with arrays of String to force GC         for  int i = 1; i <= 10_000; i++  {             String[] s = new String[10_000];             try {                 Thread.sleep 1 ;             } catch  InterruptedException e  {             }          }          log.info "Getting val for 3 =  {}", weakDictionary.  getExplanationFor 3  ;          log.info "DONE." ;     } }  So, after retrieving the WeakDictionary reference, a lot of String arrays are created  to force GC to delete the map from memory. After that, we try to access the problematic  map. Will it work?  INFO  c.a.b.c.WeakDictionaryDemo - Testing WeakDictionaryDemo... INFO  c.a.b.c.u.WeakDictionary - Starting to create dictionary: 1536633126455 INFO  c.a.b.c.u.WeakDictionary - Done creating dictionary: 1536633126701 INFO  c.a.b.c.u.WeakDictionary - Cleaned up the dictionary!  594   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  INFO  c.a.b.c.u.WeakDictionary - Starting to create dictionary: 1536633139512 INFO  c.a.b.c.u.WeakDictionary - Done creating dictionary: 1536633139742 INFO  c.a.b.c.WeakDictionaryDemo - Getting val for 3 =  Ingermy... INFO  c.a.b.c.WeakDictionaryDemo - DONE.  The log proves this works. And not only that, we can see the map being discarded by   GC and then reinitialized when needed. This is the power of soft references.  Although the garbage collection process is un-deterministic, because it cannot be  controlled much from the code, a Java program cannot tell it to start, pause or stop, but  using the appropriate VM options we can control the resources it has and from the code  using the proper implementation we can tell it what to collect or not and most of the  times this is enough.2   Garbage Collection Exceptions and Causes If objects cannot be discarded from the memory, an exception of type OutOfMemoryError  is thrown. I’m not sure if you noticed, but this is not actually an exception. The exception  class hierarchy was mentioned in Chapter 5. If you remember, in that hierarchy  there was a class named java.lang.Error that implements java.lang.Throwable.  These types of objects are thrown by a program when there is a critical issue that the  program cannot recover from. The following is the full hierarchy of the  java.lang. OutOfMemoryError.  java.lang.Object      java.lang.Throwable           java.lang.Error                java.lang.VirtualMachineError                     java.lang.OutOfMemoryError  So, OutOfMemoryError is one of those ugly things you do not want thrown when your  program is running, because this means your program is no longer running. In this case,  it is not running because it has no memory left to store new objects being created.  2 If you want more details about GC this article is on point: https:  www.oracle.com  technetwork tutorials tutorials-1876574.html  595   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  This error is being thrown by the JVM when anything goes wrong when doing   memory management. Although, the most common cause is that the heap memory is  depleted, there are other causes.  When heap memory allocated to the JVM is depleted, the error has the following   message:  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space  But there is another message that you might see.  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC Overhead Limit  Exceeded  This message is still related to the heap size. The error is thrown with this message  when the data for the program barely fits the size of the heap, so the heap is almost full,  which allows the GC to run, but because it cannot redeem any memory, the GC keeps  running, and it is hindering the normal execution of the application. This message  is added to the error when the GC spends 98% of execution time and the application  spends the other 2%.  These two are the most common error messages you see when GC cannot do its job   properly for whatever reason. A complete list can be found at https:  docs.oracle. com javase 8 docs technotes guides troubleshoot memleaks002.html, but since  most GC issues relate to the heap size, G1GC mostly throws errors with the Java heap  space message.   Summary This section ends this book. When it comes to the Java ecosystem, there are a lot of books  and tutorials on the Internet. This book only scratches the surface to give you a good  starting point as a Java developer. The whole team that worked on it hopes it satisfies  your needs and sparks your curiosity to find out more. Just keep in mind that there is no  panacea solution to make sure the memory is always managed right regardless of the  application scope. If you get in trouble, experimentation is always a step in determining  the right collector for your JVM.  596   Chapter 13    GarbaGe ColleCtion  This chapter has covered the following topics.     what garbage collection is and the steps involved     how the heap memory is structured     how many types of garbage collectors there are in the Oracle HotSpot   JVM and how can we switch between them     how to view a garbage collector configurations and statistics using   VM options  Cleaner     how to view the garbage collection in action using finalize and      how to stop the garbage collector from collecting important objects     how to create objects that are easily collected using soft references  597   Index  A Abstract Window Toolkit  AWT ,    9, 14, 420–422  Access modifiers  compilation error, 62 member-level accessors, 60, 63 package-private modifier, 61 public class, 60 top-level, 60  anonymous class, 285 anyMatch ..  method, 309 Apache Tomcat, 577 Arrays, 92 Assignment operator  = , 209–210 AudioType, 299  B Binary operators, 217 Binary representation, 168–169 Binary serialization, 503–507 Bitwise operators, 227  AND, 228, 230 NOT, 227–228 OR, 230–231 XOR, 231–232  Boxing, 190 Bubble sort algorithm, 256, 267 Building blocks  access modifiers, 60 class, 56 fields, 56 JAR, 58 library, 59 methods, 56 modules, 60 package-info.java, 57  C Checked exceptions, 143–144 Classes  abstraction  Actor class, 123 Human class, 121–122 Java compiler error, 122 Musician class, 123 parent class superclass, 122 subclass, 122 UML diagram, IntelliJ    IDEA, 123–124  constructors, 117–120 data encapsulation, 111–114 fields, 108–110 instantiation, 107–108 methods, 115–117 variables, 110–111  Comments, 107 Compact String, 187    Iuliana Cosmina 2018  I.

Write your first code in Java using simple, step-by-step examples that model real-word objects and events, making learning easy. With this book you’ll be able to pick up the concepts without fuss. Java for Absolute Beginners teaches Java development in language anyone can understand, giving you the best possible start. You’ll see clear code descriptions and layout so that you can get your code running as soon as possible. After reading this book, you'll come away with the basics to get started writing programs in Java.
Author Iuliana Cosmina focuses on practical knowledge and getting up to speed quickly―all the bits and pieces a novice needs to get started programming in Java. First, you’ll discover how Java is executed, what type of language it is, and what it is good for. With the theory out of the way, you’ll install Java, choose an editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, and write your first simple Java program. Along the way you’ll compile and execute this program so it can run on any platform that supports Java. As part of this tutorial you’ll see how to write high-quality code by following conventions and respecting well-known programming principles, making your projects more professional and efficient.
Finally, alongside the core features of Java, you’ll learn skills in some of the newest and most exciting features of the language: Generics, Lambda expressions, modular organization, local-variable type inference, and local variable syntax for Lambda expressions.
Java for Absolute Beginners gives you all you need to start your Java 9+ programming journey. No experience necessary.

What You'll Learn
• Use data types, operators, and the new stream API
• Install and use a build tool such as Gradle
• Build interactive Java applications with JavaFX
• Exchange data using the new JSON APIs
• Play with images using multi-resolution APIs
• Use the publish-subscribe framework
