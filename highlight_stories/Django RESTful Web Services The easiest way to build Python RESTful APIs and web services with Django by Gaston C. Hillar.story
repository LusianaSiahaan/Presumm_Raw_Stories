Preface  Python	is	definitely	one	of	the	most	popular	programming	languages.	It	is open	source,	multiplatform,	and	you	can	use	it	to	develop	any	kind	of application,	from	websites	and	web	services	to	artificial	intelligence	and machine	learning	applications.	You	will	always	find	a	framework	or	a	set of	packages	in	Python	to	make	things	easier	for	you	in	any	domain.	It	is extremely	easy	to	work	with	Python	and	its	most	popular	web	framework, Django,	in	the	most	important	and	popular	cloud	computing	providers. Hence,	Python	is	an	excellent	choice	for	developing	modern	and	scalable RESTful	Web	Services	that	will	run	on	the	cloud.  REST	 short	for	Representational	State	Transfer 	is	the	architectural	style that	has	been	driving	modern	and	scalable	web	development	recently.	If you	want	to	be	part	of	the	world	that	builds	complex	web	applications	and mobile	apps,	you	will	need	to	develop	and	interact	with	RESTful	Web Services.	In	many	situations,	you	will	have	to	design	and	develop	a RESTful	Web	Service	from	scratch	and	maintain	the	API	over	time.	A deep	knowledge	of	RESTful	Web	Services	is	an	essential	skill	for	any software	development	job.  This	book	covers	everything	you	need	to	know	to	develop	and	test	a RESTful	Web	Service	from	scratch	with	the	latest	version	of	Django, Django	REST	framework,	and	Python.	You	will	work	with	real-life examples	in	combination	with	Python	packages	that	will	allow	you	to simplify	tasks.  You	will	learn	to	use	a	huge	set	of	tools	to	test	and	develop	a	uniform, high-quality,	and	scalable	RESTful	Web	Services.	You	will	use	object- oriented	programming	and	modern	Python	3.6	code	to	favor	code	reuse and	simplify	future	maintenance.	You	will	take	advantage	of	automated testing	to	ensure	that	the	coded	RESTful	Web	Services	run	as	expected.   This	book	will	allow	you	to	create	your	own	RESTful	Web	Services	for any	domain	with	Django	and	Django	REST	framework	in	Python	3.6	or greater.	You	will	learn	the	process	for	the	most	popular	Python	platforms: Linux,	Windows,	and	macOS.   Who	this	book	is	for  This	book	is	for	Python	developers	who	want	to	develop	RESTful	Web Services,	also	known	as	RESTful	web	APIs,	with	Python	3.6	or	greater, and	want	to	learn	how	to	do	it	with	the	most	popular	Python	web framework—Django.   What	this	book	covers  Chapter	1,	Installing	the	Required	Software	and	Tools,	shows	how	to	get started	in	our	journey	toward	creating	RESTful	Web	Services	with	Python and	its	most	popular	web	framework—Django.	We	will	install	and configure	the	environments,	the	software,	and	the	tools	required	to	create RESTful	Web	Services	with	Django	and	Django	REST	framework.	We will	learn	the	necessary	steps	in	Linux,	macOS,	and	Windows.	We	will create	our	first	app	with	Django,	we	will	take	a	first	look	at	the	Django folders,	files,	and	configurations,	and	we	will	make	the	necessary	changes to	activate	Django	REST	framework.	In	addition,	we	will	introduce	and install	command-line	and	GUI	tools	that	we	will	use	to	interact	with	the RESTful	Web	Services	that	we	will	design,	code,	and	test	in	the forthcoming	chapters.  Chapter	2,	Working	with	Models,	Migrations,	Serialization,	and Deserialization,	describes	how	to	design	a	RESTful	Web	Service	to interact	with	a	simple	SQLite	database	and	perform	CRUD	operations with	toys.	We	will	define	the	requirements	for	our	web	service,	and	we will	understand	the	tasks	performed	by	each	HTTP	method	and	the different	scopes.	We	will	create	a	model	to	represent	and	persist	toys	and execute	migrations	in	Django	to	create	the	required	tables	in	the	database. We	will	analyze	the	tables	and	learn	how	to	manage	the	serialization	of	toy instances	into	JSON	representations	with	Django	REST	framework	and the	reverse	process.  Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	is	about	executing	the	first	version	of	a simple	Django	RESTful	Web	Service	that	interacts	with	a	SQLite database.	We	will	write	API	views	to	process	diverse	HTTP	requests	on	a collection	of	toys	and	on	a	specific	toy.	We	will	work	with	the	following HTTP	verbs:	GET,	POST,	and	PUT.	We	will	configure	the	URL	patterns list	to	route	URLs	to	views.	We	will	start	the	Django	development	server and	use	command-line	tools	 curl	and	HTTPie 	to	compose	and	send   diverse	HTTP	requests	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will	learn	how HTTP	requests	are	processed	in	Django	and	our	code.	In	addition,	we	will work	with	Postman,	a	GUI	tool,	to	compose	and	send	other	HTTP	requests to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.  Chapter	4,	Using	Generalized	Behavior	from	the	APIView	Class,	presents different	ways	to	improve	our	simple	Django	RESTful	Web	Service.	We will	take	advantage	of	many	features	included	in	the	Django	REST framework	to	remove	duplicate	code	and	add	many	features	for	the	web service.	We	will	use	model	serializers,	understand	the	different	accepted and	returned	content	types,	and	the	importance	of	providing	accurate responses	to	the	HTTP	OPTIONS	requests.	We	will	make	the	necessary changes	to	the	existing	code	to	enable	diverse	parsers	and	renderers.	We will	learn	how	things	work	under	the	hoods	in	Django	REST	framework. We	will	work	with	different	content	types	and	note	how	the	RESTful	Web Service	improves	compared	to	its	previous	versions.  Chapter	5,	Understanding	and	Customizing	the	Browsable	API	Feature, explains	how	to	use	one	of	the	additional	features	that	Django	REST framework	adds	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service—the	browsable	API.	We will	use	a	web	browser	to	work	with	our	first	web	service	built	with Django.	We	will	learn	to	make	HTTP	GET,	POST,	PUT,	OPTIONS,	and DELETE	requests	with	the	browsable	API.	We	will	be	able	to	easily	test CRUD	operations	with	a	web	browser.	The	browsable	API	will	allow	us	to easily	interact	with	our	RESTful	Web	Service.  Chapter	6,	Working	with	Advanced	Relationships	and	Serialization,	shows how	to	define	the	requirements	for	a	complex	RESTful	Web	Service	in which	we	needed	to	work	with	drone	categories,	drones,	pilots,	and competitions.	We	will	create	a	new	app	with	Django	and	configure	the new	web	service.	We	will	define	many-to-one	relationships	between	the models,	and	we	will	configure	Django	to	work	with	a	PostgreSQL database.	We	will	execute	migrations	to	generate	tables	with	relationships between	them.	We	will	also	analyze	the	generated	database	and	configure serialization	and	deserialization	for	the	models.	We	will	define	hyperlinks and	work	with	class-based	views.	Then,	we	will	take	advantage	of	generic classes	and	generic	views	that	generalize	and	mix	predefined	behaviors.   We	will	use	routings	and	endpoints	and	prepare	our	RESTful	Web	Service to	work	with	the	browsable	API.	We	will	make	many	different	HTTP requests	to	create	and	retrieve	resources	that	have	relationships	between them.  Chapter	7,	Using	Constraints,	Filtering,	Searching,	Ordering,	and Pagination,	describes	the	usage	of	the	browsable	API	feature	to	navigate through	the	API	with	resources	and	relationships.	We	will	add	unique constraints	to	improve	the	consistency	of	the	models	in	our	RESTful	Web Service.	We	will	understand	the	importance	of	paginating	results	and configure	and	test	a	global	limit offset	pagination	scheme	with	Django REST	framework.	Then,	we	will	create	our	own	customized	pagination class	to	ensure	that	requests	won't	be	able	to	require	a	huge	number	of elements	on	a	single	page.	We	will	configure	filter	backend	classes	and incorporate	code	into	the	models	to	add	filtering,	searching,	and	ordering capabilities	to	the	class-based	views.	We	will	create	a	customized	filter and	make	requests	to	filter,	search,	and	order	results.	Finally,	we	will	use the	browsable	API	to	test	pagination,	filtering,	and	ordering.  Chapter	8,	Securing	the	API	with	Authentication	and	Permissions,	presents the	differences	between	authentication	and	permissions	in	Django,	Django REST	framework,	and	RESTful	Web	Services.	We	will	analyze	the authentication	classes	included	in	Django	REST	framework	out	of	the	box. We	will	follow	the	steps	needed	to	provide	security-	and	permissions- related	data	to	models.  We	will	work	with	object-level	permissions	via	customized	permission classes	and	save	information	about	users	who	make	requests.	We	will configure	permission	policies	and	compose	and	send	authenticated requests	to	understand	how	the	permission	policies	work.	We	will	use command-line	tools	and	GUI	tools	to	compose	and	send	authenticated requests.	We	will	browse	the	secure	RESTful	Web	Service	with	the browsable	API	feature	and	work	with	a	simple	token-based	authentication provided	by	Django	REST	framework	to	understand	another	way	of authenticating	requests.  Chapter	9,	Applying	Throttling	Rules	and	Versioning	Management,	focuses   on	the	importance	of	throttling	rules	and	how	we	can	combine	them	with authentication	and	permissions	in	Django,	Django	REST	framework,	and RESTful	Web	Services.	We	will	analyze	the	throttling	classes	included	in Django	REST	framework	out	of	the	box.	We	will	follow	the	necessary steps	to	configure	many	throttling	policies	in	Django	REST	framework. We	will	work	with	global	and	scope-related	settings.	Then,	we	will	use command-line	tools	to	compose	and	send	many	requests	to	test	how	the throttling	rules	work.	We	will	understand	versioning	classes	and	we	will configure	a	URL	path	versioning	scheme	to	allow	us	to	work	with	two versions	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will	use	command-line	tools and	the	Browsable	API	to	understand	the	differences	between	the	two versions.  Chapter	10,	Automating	Tests,	shows	how	to	automate	tests	for	our	RESTful Web	Services	developed	with	Django	and	Django	REST	framework.	We will	use	different	packages,	tools,	and	configurations	to	perform	tests.	We will	write	the	first	round	of	unit	tests	for	our	RESTful	Web	Service,	run them,	and	measure	tests	code	coverage.	Then,	we	will	analyze	tests	code coverage	reports	and	write	new	unit	tests	to	improve	the	test	code coverage.	We	will	understand	the	new	tests	code	coverage	reports	and learn	the	benefits	of	a	good	test	code	coverage.

Installing	the	Required Software	and	Tools  In	this	chapter,	we	will	start	our	journey	towards	creating	RESTful	Web Services	with	Python	and	its	most	popular	web	framework:	Django. Python	is	one	of	the	most	popular	and	versatile	programming	languages. There	are	thousands	of	Python	packages,	which	allow	you	to	extend Python	capabilities	to	any	kind	of	domain	you	can	imagine.	You	can	work with	Django	and	packages	to	easily	build	simple	and	complex	RESTful Web	Services	with	Python	that	can	run	on	your	favorite	platform.  We	will	leverage	your	existing	knowledge	of	Python	and	all	of	its packages	to	code	the	different	pieces	of	your	RESTful	Web	Services	and their	ecosystem.	We	will	use	object-oriented	features	to	create	code	that	is easier	to	maintain,	understand,	and	reuse.	We	don't	need	to	learn	another programming	language,	we	can	use	the	one	we	already	know	and	love: Python.  In	this	chapter,	we	will	install	and	configure	the	environments	and	the required	software	and	tools	to	create	RESTful	Web	Services	with	Django and	Django	REST	framework.	We	will	learn	the	necessary	steps	in	Linux, macOS,	and	Windows.	We	will	gain	an	understanding	of	the	following:  Creating	a	virtual	environment	with	Python	3.x	and	PEP	405  Understanding	the	directory	structure	for	a	virtual	environment  Activating	the	virtual	environment  Deactivating	the	virtual	environment  Installing	Django	and	Django	REST	framework	in	an	isolated   Understanding	Django	folders,	files,	and	configurations  environment  Creating	an	app	with	Django  Installing	Curl  Installing	HTTPie  Installing	Stoplight  Installing	iCurlHTTP  Installing	the	Postman	REST	client   Creating	a	virtual	environment with	Python	3.x	and	PEP	405  Throughout	this	book,	we	will	be	working	with	different	packages	and libraries	to	create	RESTful	Web	Services,	and	therefore	it	is	convenient	to work	with	Python	virtual	environments.	Python	3.3	introduced	lightweight virtual	environments	and	they	were	improved	in	Python	3.4.	We	will	work with	these	virtual	environments,	and	therefore	you	will	need	Python	3.4	or greater.	You	can	read	more	information	about	PEP	405	Python	Virtual Environment,	that	introduced	the	venv	module,	here:	https:  www.python.org de v peps pep-0405.	All	the	examples	in	this	book	were	tested	on	Python	3.6.2 on	Linux,	macOS,	and	Windows.  In	case	you	decide	to	use	the	popular	virtualenv	 https:  pypi.p ython.org pypi virtualenv 	third-party	virtual	environment builder	or	the	virtual	environment	options	provided	by	your Python	IDE,	you	just	have	to	make	sure	that	you	activate your	virtual	environment	with	the	appropriate	mechanism whenever	it	is	necessary	to	do	so,	instead	of	following	the step	explained	to	activate	the	virtual	environment	generated with	the	venv	module	integrated	in	Python.  Each	virtual	environment	we	create	with	venv	is	an	isolated	environment and	it	will	have	its	own	independent	set	of	installed	Python	packages	in	its site	directories	 folders .	When	we	create	a	virtual	environment	with	venv in	Python	3.4	and	greater,	pip	is	included	in	the	new	virtual	environment. In	Python	3.3,	it	was	necessary	to	manually	install	pip	after	creating	the virtual	environment.	Note	that	the	instructions	provided	are	compatible with	Python	3.4	or	greater,	including	Python	3.6.2.  In	order	to	create	a	lightweight	virtual	environment,	the	first	step	is	to select	the	target	folder	or	directory	for	it.	The	following	is	the	path	we	will   use	in	the	example	for	Linux	and	macOS.  The	target	folder	for	the	virtual	environment	will	be	the	HillarDjangoREST 01 folder	within	our	home	directory.	For	example,	if	our	home	directory	in macOS	or	Linux	is	 Users gaston,	the	virtual	environment	will	be	created within	 Users gaston HillarDjangoREST 01.	You	can	replace	the	specified	path with	your	desired	path	in	each	command:  				~ HillarDjangoREST 01  The	following	is	the	path	we	will	use	in	the	example	for	Windows.	The target	folder	for	the	virtual	environment	will	be	the	HillarDjangoREST\01 folder	within	our	user	profile	folder.	For	example,	if	our	user	profile	folder is	C:\Users\gaston,	the	virtual	environment	will	be	created	within C:\Users\gaston\HillarDjangoREST\01.	You	can	replace	the	specified	path	with your	desired	path	in	each	command:  				%USERPROFILE%\HillarDjangoREST\01  In	Windows	PowerShell,	the	previous	path	would	be	as	follows:  				$env:userprofile\HillarDjangoREST\01  Now,	we	will	create	a	new	virtual	environment	with	venv.	In	order	to	do	so, we	have	to	use	the	-m	option	followed	by	the	venv	module	name	and	the desired	path	to	make	Python	run	this	module	as	a	script	and	create	a virtual	environment	in	the	specified	path.	The	instructions	are	different depending	on	the	platform	in	which	we	are	creating	the	virtual environment.  Open	Terminal	in	Linux	or	macOS	and	execute	the	following	command	to create	a	virtual	environment:   				python3	-m	venv	~ HillarDjangoREST 01  In	Windows,	in	Command	Prompt,	execute	the	following	command	to create	a	virtual	environment:  				python	-m	venv	%USERPROFILE%\HillarDjangoREST\01  If	you	want	to	work	with	Windows	PowerShell,	execute	the	following command	to	create	a	virtual	environment:  				python	-m	venv	$env:userprofile\HillarDjangoREST\01  None	of	the	previous	commands	produce	any	output.	The	script	created the	specified	target	folder	and	installed	pip	by	invoking	ensurepip	because we	didn't	specify	the	--without-pip	option.   Understanding	the	directory structure	for	a	virtual environment  The	specified	target	folder	has	a	new	directory	tree	that	contains	Python executable	files	and	other	files	that	indicate	it	is	a	PEP405	virtual environment.  In	the	root	directory	for	the	virtual	environment,	the	pyenv.cfg	configuration file	specifies	different	options	for	the	virtual	environment	and	its	existence is	an	indicator	that	we	are	in	the	root	folder	for	a	virtual	environment.	In Linux	and	macOS,	the	folder	will	have	the	following	main	subfolders:	bin, include,	lib,	lib python3.6,	and	lib python3.6 site-packages.	In	Windows,	the folder	will	have	the	following	main	subfolders:	Include,	Lib,	Lib\site- packages,	and	Scripts.	The	directory	trees	for	the	virtual	environment	in	each platform	are	the	same	as	the	layout	of	the	Python	installation	on	these platforms.  The	following	diagram	shows	the	folders	and	files	in	the	directory	trees generated	for	the	01	virtual	environments	in	macOS	and	Linux	platforms:   The	following	diagram	shows	the	main	folders	in	the	directory	trees generated	for	the	virtual	environment	in	Windows:  After	we	activate	the	virtual	environment,	we	will	install third-party	packages	into	the	virtual	environment	and	the modules	will	be	located	in	the	lib python3.6 site-packages	or Lib\site-packages	folder,	based	on	the	platform.	The executables	will	be	copied	in	the	bin	or	Scripts	folder,	based on	the	platform.	The	packages	we	install	won't	make	changes to	other	virtual	environments	or	our	base	Python environment.   Activating	the	virtual environment  Now	that	we	have	created	a	virtual	environment,	we	will	run	a	platform- specific	script	to	activate	it.	After	we	activate	the	virtual	environment,	we will	install	packages	that	will	only	be	available	in	this	virtual	environment. This	way,	we	will	work	with	an	isolated	environment	in	which	all	the packages	we	install	won't	affect	our	main	Python	environment.  Note	that	the	results	of	this	command	will	be	accurate	if	you	don't	start	a different	shell	than	the	default	shell	in	the	terminal	session.	If	you	have doubts,	check	your	terminal	configuration	and	preferences.	Run	the following	command	in	the	Terminal	in	Linux	or	macOS:  				echo	$SHELL  The	command	will	display	the	name	of	the	shell	you	are	using	in	the Terminal.	In	macOS,	the	default	is	 bin bash	and	this	means	you	are working	with	the	bash	shell.	Depending	on	the	shell,	you	must	run	a different	command	to	activate	the	virtual	environment	in	Linux	or	macOS.  If	your	Terminal	is	configured	to	use	the	bash	shell	in	Linux	or	macOS,	run the	following	command	to	activate	the	virtual	environment.	The	command also	works	for	the	zsh	shell:  				source	~ HillarDjangoREST 01 bin activate  If	your	Terminal	is	configured	to	use	either	the	csh	or	tcsh	shell,	run	the following	command	to	activate	the	virtual	environment:   				source	~ HillarDjangoREST 01 bin activate.csh  If	your	Terminal	is	configured	to	use	the	fish	shell,	run	the	following command	to	activate	the	virtual	environment:  				source	~ HillarDjangoREST 01 bin activate.fish  After	you	activate	the	virtual	environment,	Command	Prompt	will	display the	virtual	environment	root	folder	name	enclosed	in	parentheses	as	a prefix	of	the	default	prompt	to	remind	us	that	we	are	working	in	the	virtual environment.	In	this	case,	we	will	see	 01 	as	a	prefix	for	the	Command Prompt	because	the	root	folder	for	the	activated	virtual	environment	is	01.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	virtual	environment	activated	in	a macOS	Sierra	Terminal	with	a	bash	shell,	after	executing	the	previously shown	commands:  As	we	can	see	from	the	previous	screenshot,	the	prompt	changed	from  Gastons-MacBook-Pro:~	gaston$	to	 01 	Gastons-MacBook-Pro:~	gaston$	after	the activation	of	the	virtual	environment.  In	Windows,	you	can	run	either	a	batch	file	in	the	Command	Prompt	or	a Windows	PowerShell	script	to	activate	the	virtual	environment.  If	you	prefer	Command	Prompt,	run	the	following	command	in	the Windows	command	line	to	activate	the	virtual	environment:   				%USERPROFILE%\HillarDjangoREST\01\Scripts\activate.bat  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	virtual	environment	activated	in Windows	10	Command	Prompt,	after	executing	the	previously	shown commands:  As	we	can	see	from	the	previous	screenshot,	the	prompt	changed	from C:\Users\gaston	to	 01 	C:\Users\gaston	after	the	activation	of	the	virtual environment.  If	you	prefer	Windows	PowerShell,	launch	it	and	run	the	following commands	to	activate	the	virtual	environment.	Note	that	you	must	have scripts	execution	enabled	in	Windows	PowerShell	to	be	able	to	run	the script:  				cd	$env:USERPROFILE 				HillarDjangoREST\01\Scripts\Activate.ps1  If	you	receive	an	error	similar	to	the	following	lines,	it	means	that	you don't	have	scripts	execution	enabled:  				C:\Users\gaston\HillarDjangoREST\01\Scripts\Activate.ps1	:	File	C:\Users\gaston\HillarDjangoREST\01\Scripts\Activate.ps1	cannot	be	loaded	because	running	scripts	is	disabled	on	this	system.

This policy	allows	the	execution	of	individual	commands	but	it	doesn't	run scripts.	Thus,	in	case	you	want	to	work	with	Windows	PowerShell,	you will	have	to	change	the	policy	to	allow	the	execution	of	scripts.	It	is	very important	to	make	sure	that	you	understand	the	risks	of	the	Windows PowerShell	execution	policies	that	allow	you	to	run	unsigned	scripts.	For more	information	about	the	different	policies,	check	the	following	web page:	https:  docs.microsoft.com en-us powershell module microsoft.powershell.core  about about_execution_policies?view=powershell-6.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	virtual	environment	activated	in	a Windows	10	PowerShell,	after	executing	the	previously	shown commands:   Deactivating	the	virtual environment  It	is	extremely	easy	to	deactivate	a	virtual	environment	generated	by	the previously	explained	process.	The	deactivation	will	remove	all	the changes	made	in	the	environment	variables	and	will	change	the	prompt back	to	its	default	message.	Once	you	deactivate	a	virtual	environment, you	will	go	back	to	the	default	Python	environment.  In	macOS	or	Linux,	just	type	deactivate	and	press	Enter.  In	a	Windows	Command	Prompt,	you	have	to	run	the	deactivate.bat	batch file	included	in	the	Scripts	folder.	In	our	example,	the	full	path	for	this	file is	%USERPROFILE%\HillarDjangoREST\01\Scripts\deactivate.bat.  In	Windows	PowerShell,	you	have	to	run	the	Deactivate.ps1	script	in	the Scripts	folder.	In	our	example,	the	full	path	for	this	file	is $env:userprofile\HillarDjangoREST\01\Scripts\Deactivate.ps1.	Remember	that	you must	have	scripts	execution	enabled	in	Windows	PowerShell	to	be	able	to run	the	script.  The	instructions	in	the	next	sections	assume	that	the	virtual	environment we	have	created	is	activated.   Installing	Django	and	Django REST	frameworks	in	an isolated	environment  We	have	created	and	activated	a	lightweight	virtual	environment.	It	is	time to	run	many	commands	that	will	be	the	same	for	either	Linux,	macOS,	or Windows.  First,	run	the	following	command	to	install	the	Django	web	framework:  pip	install	django==1.11.5  The	last	lines	of	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	django	package	has	been successfully	installed.	The	process	will	also	install	the	pytz	package	that provides	world	time	zone	definitions.	Take	into	account	that	you	may	also see	a	notice	to	upgrade	pip.	The	next	lines	show	a	sample	of	the	four	last lines	of	the	output	generated	by	a	successful	pip	installation:  Collecting	django Collecting	pytz	 from	django  Installing	collected	packages:	pytz,	django Successfully	installed	django-1.11.5	pytz-2017.2  Now	that	we	have	installed	the	Django	web	framework,	we	can	install Django	REST	framework.	Django	REST	framework	works	on	top	of Django	and	provides	us	with	a	powerful	and	flexible	toolkit	to	build RESTful	Web	Services.	We	just	need	to	run	the	following	command	to install	this	package:   pip	install	djangorestframework==3.6.4  The	last	lines	for	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	djangorestframework package	has	been	successfully	installed,	as	shown	here:  Collecting	djangorestframework Installing	collected	packages:	djangorestframework Successfully	installed	djangorestframework-3.6.4		  After	following	the	previous	steps,	we	will	have	Django	REST	framework 3.6.4	and	Django	1.11.5	installed	in	our	virtual	environment.	We	will install	additional	packages	as	we	need	them	in	the	forthcoming	chapters.   Creating	an	app	with	Django  Now,	we	will	create	our	first	app	with	Django	and	we	will	analyze	the directory	structure	that	Django	creates.	First,	go	to	the	root	folder	for	the virtual	environment:	01.  In	Linux	or	macOS,	enter	the	following	command:  cd	~ HillarDjangoREST 01  If	you	prefer	Command	Prompt,	run	the	following	command	in	the Windows	command	line:  cd	 d	%USERPROFILE%\HillarDjangoREST\01  If	you	prefer	Windows	PowerShell,	run	the	following	command	in Windows	PowerShell:  cd	 d	$env:USERPROFILE\HillarDjangoREST\01		  In	Linux	or	macOS,	run	the	following	command	to	create	a	new	Django project	named	restful01.	The	command	won't	produce	any	output:  python	bin django-admin.py	startproject	restful01		  In	Windows,	in	either	Command	Prompt	or	PowerShell,	run	the	following command	to	create	a	new	Django	project	named	restful01.	The	command won't	produce	any	output:   python	Scripts\django-admin.py	startproject	restful01		  The	previous	command	creates	a	restful01	folder	with	other	subfolders	and Python	files.	Now,	go	to	the	recently	created	restful01	folder.	Just	execute the	following	command	on	any	platform:  cd	restful01  Then,	run	the	following	command	to	create	a	new	Django	app	named	toys within	the	restful01	Django	project.	The	command	won't	produce	any output:  python	manage.py	startapp	toys  The	previous	command	creates	a	new	restful01 toys	subfolder,	with	the following	files:  views.py  tests.py  models.py  apps.py  admin.py  __init__.py  In	addition,	the	restful01 toys	folder	will	have	a	migrations	subfolder	with	an __init__.py	Python	script.	The	following	diagram	shows	the	folders	and files	in	the	directory	tree,	starting	at	the	restful01	folder	with	two subfolders	-	toys	and	restful01:    Understanding	Django	folders, files,	and	configurations  After	we	create	our	first	Django	project	and	then	a	Django	app,	there	are many	new	folders	and	files.	First,	use	your	favorite	editor	or	IDE	to	check the	Python	code	in	the	apps.py	file	within	the	restful01 toys	folder  restful01\toys	in	Windows .	The	following	lines	show	the	code	for	this file:  from	django.apps	import	AppConfig	 	 	 class	ToysConfig AppConfig :	 				name	=	'toys'	  The	code	declares	the	ToysConfig	class	as	a	subclass	of	the django.apps.AppConfig	class	that	represents	a	Django	application	and	its configuration.	The	ToysConfig	class	just	defines	the	name	class	attribute	and sets	its	value	to	'toys'.  Now,	we	have	to	add	toys.apps.ToysConfig	as	one	of	the	installed	apps	in	the restful01 settings.py	file	that	configures	settings	for	the	restful01	Django project.	I	built	the	previous	string	by	concatenating	many	values	as follows:	app	name	+	.apps.	+	class	name,	which	is,	toys	+	.apps.	+	ToysConfig. In	addition,	we	have	to	add	the	rest_framework	app	to	make	it	possible	for	us to	use	Django	REST	framework.  The	restful01 settings.py	file	is	a	Python	module	with	module-level variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project. We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file.	Open	the restful01 settings.py	file	and	locate	the	highlighted	lines	that	specify	the strings	list	that	declares	the	installed	apps.	The	following	code	shows	the   first	lines	for	the	settings.py	file.	Note	that	the	file	has	more	code:  """	 Django	settings	for	restful01	project.	 	 Generated	by	'django-admin	startproject'	using	Django	1.11.5.	 	 For	more	information	on	this	file,	see	 https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 topics settings 	 	 For	the	full	list	of	settings	and	their	values,	see	 https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref settings 	 """	 	 import	os	 	 	Build	paths	inside	the	project	like	this:	os.path.join BASE_DIR,	...

The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_01	folder:  INSTALLED_APPS	=	[	 				'django.contrib.admin',	 				'django.contrib.auth',	 				'django.contrib.contenttypes',	 				'django.contrib.sessions',	 				'django.contrib.messages',	 				'django.contrib.staticfiles',	 					Django	REST	framework	 				'rest_framework',	 					Toys	application	 				'toys.apps.ToysConfig',	 ]	  This	way,	we	have	added	Django	REST	framework	and	the	toys application	to	our	initial	Django	project	named	restful01.   Installing	tools  Now,	we	will	leave	Django	for	a	while	and	we	will	install	many	tools	that we	will	use	to	interact	with	the	RESTful	Web	Services	that	we	will develop	throughout	this	book.  We	will	use	the	following	different	kinds	of	tools	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	and	visualize	the	responses	throughout	our	book:  Command-line	tools  GUI	tools  Python	code  Web	browser  JavaScript	code  You	can	use	any	other	application	that	allows	you	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests.	There	are	many	apps	that	run	on	tablets	and	smartphones that	allow	you	to	accomplish	this	task.	However,	we	will	focus	our attention	on	the	most	useful	tools	when	building	RESTful	Web	Services with	Django.   Installing	Curl  We	will	start	installing	command-line	tools.	One	of	the	key	advantages	of command-line	tools	is	that	you	can	easily	run	again	the	HTTP requests	again	after	we	have	built	them	for	the	first	time,	and	we	don't need	to	use	the	mouse	or	tap	the	screen	to	run	requests.	We	can	also	easily build	a	script	with	batch	requests	and	run	them.  As	happens	with	any	command-line	tool,	it	can	take	more	time	to	perform the	first	requests	compared	with	GUI	tools,	but	it	becomes	easier	once	we have	performed	many	requests	and	we	can	easily	reuse	the	commands	we have	written	in	the	past	to	compose	new	requests.  Curl,	also	known	as	cURL,	is	a	very	popular	open	source	command-line tool	and	library	that	allows	us	to	easily	transfer	data.	We	can	use	the	curl command-line	tool	to	easily	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	and	check their	responses.  In	Linux	or	macOS,	you	can	open	a	Terminal	and	start	using	curl	from	the command	line.  In	Windows,	you	have	two	options.	You	can	work	with	curl	in	Command Prompt	or	you	can	decide	to	install	curl	as	part	of	the	Cygwin	package installation	option	and	execute	it	from	the	Cygwin	terminal.	You	can	read more	about	the	Cygwin	terminal	and	its	installation	procedure	at:	http:  cyg win.com install.html.	Windows	Powershell	includes	a	curl	alias	that	calls	the Invoke-WebRequest	command,	and	therefore,	if	you	want	to	work	with Windows	Powershell	with	curl,	it	is	necessary	to	remove	the	curl	alias.  If	you	want	to	use	the	curl	command	within	Command	Prompt,	you	just need	to	download	and	unzip	the	latest	version	of	the	curl	download	page:	h ttps:  curl.haxx.se download.html.	Make	sure	you	download	the	version	that includes	SSL	and	SSH.   The	following	screenshot	shows	the	available	downloads	for	Windows. The	Win64	-	Generic	section	includes	the	versions	that	we	can	run	in Command	Prompt	or	Windows	Powershell.  The	Win64	x86_64.7zip	file	provides	the	binary	version	for	curl	version	7.55.1 with	SSL	and	SSH	support:  After	you	unzip	the	.7zip	or	.zip	file	you	have	downloaded,	you	can include	the	folder	in	which	curl.exe	is	included	in	your	path.	For	example, if	you	unzip	the	Win64	x86_64.7zip	file,	you	will	find	curl.exe	in	the	bin	folder. The	following	screenshot	shows	the	results	of	executing	curl	--version	on	 Command	Prompt	in	Windows	10.	The	--version	option	makes	curl	display its	version	and	all	the	libraries,	protocols,	and	features	it	supports:   Installing	HTTPie  Now,	we	will	install	HTTPie,	a	command-line	HTTP	client	written	in Python	that	makes	it	easy	to	send	HTTP	requests	and	uses	a	syntax	that	is easier	than	curl.	By	default,	HTTPie	displays	colorized	output	and	uses multiple	lines	to	display	the	response	details.	In	some	cases,	HTTPie makes	it	easier	to	understand	the	responses	than	the	curl	utility.	However, one	of	the	great	disadvantages	of	HTTPie	as	a	command-line	utility	is	that it	takes	more	time	to	load	than	curl,	and	therefore,	if	you	want	to	code scripts	with	too	many	commands,	you	have	to	evaluate	whether	it	makes sense	to	use	HTTPie.  We	just	need	to	make	sure	we	run	the	following	command	in	the	virtual environment	we	have	just	created	and	activated.	This	way,	we	will	install HTTPie	only	for	our	virtual	environment.  Run	the	following	command	in	the	terminal,	Command	Prompt,	or Windows	PowerShell	to	install	the	httpie	package:  pip	install	--upgrade	httpie  The	last	lines	of	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	httpie	package	has	been successfully	installed:  				Collecting	httpie 				Collecting	colorama>=0.2.4	 from	httpie  				Collecting	requests>=2.11.0	 from	httpie  				Collecting	Pygments>=2.1.3	 from	httpie  				Collecting	idna =2.5	 from	requests>=2.11.0->httpie  				Collecting	urllib3 =1.21.1	 from	requests>=2.11.0->httpie  				Collecting	chardet =3.0.2	 from	requests>=2.11.0->httpie  				Collecting	certifi>=2017.4.17	 from	requests>=2.11.0->httpie  				Installing	collected	packages:	colorama,	idna,	urllib3,	chardet,	certifi,	requests,	Pygments,	httpie 				Successfully	installed	Pygments-2.2.0	certifi-2017.7.27.1	chardet-3.0.4	colorama-0.3.9	httpie-0.9.9	idna-2.6	requests-2.18.4	urllib3-1.22   		  If	you	don't	remember	how	to	activate	the	virtual environment	that	we	created	for	this	example,	read the	Activating	the	virtual	environment	section	in	this	chapter.  Now,	we	will	be	able	to	use	the	http	command	to	easily	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	our	future	RESTful	Web	Services	build	with	Django. The	following	screenshot	shows	the	results	of	executing	http	on	Command Prompt	in	Windows	10.	HTTPie	displays	the	valid	options	and	indicates that	a	URL	is	required:   Installing	the	Postman	REST client  So	far,	we	have	installed	two	terminal-based	or	command-line	tools	to compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	to	our	Django	development	server: cURL	and	HTTPie.	Now,	we	will	start	installing	Graphical	User Interface	 GUI 	tools.  Postman	is	a	very	popular	API	testing	suite	GUI	tool	that	allows	us	to easily	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests,	among	other	features.	Postman	is available	as	a	standalone	app	in	Linux,	macOS,	and	Windows.	You	can download	the	versions	of	the	Postman	app	from	the	following	URL:	https:   www.getpostman.com.  You	can	download	and	install	Postman	for	free	to	compose and	send	HTTP	requests	to	the	RESTful	Web	Services	we	will build	throughout	this	book.	You	just	need	to	sign	up	to Postman.	We	won't	be	using	any	of	the	paid	features	provided by	either	Postman	Pro	or	Postman	Enterprise	in	our examples.	All	the	instructions	work	with	Postman	5.2.1	or greater.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	HTTP	GET	request	builder	in Postman:    Installing	Stoplight  Stoplight	is	a	very	useful	GUI	tool	that	focuses	on	helping	architects	and developers	to	model	complex	APIs.	If	we	need	to	consume	our	RESTful Web	Service	in	many	different	programming	languages,	we	will	find Stoplight	extremely	helpful.	Stoplight	provides	an	HTTP	request	maker that	allows	us	to	compose	and	send	requests	and	generate	the	necessary code	to	make	them	in	different	programming	languages,	such	as JavaScript,	Swift,	C,	PHP,	Node,	and	Go,	among	others.  Stoplight	provides	a	web	version	and	is	also	available	as	a	standalone	app in	Linux,	macOS,	and	Windows.	You	can	download	the	versions	of Stoplight	from	the	following	URL:	http:  stoplight.io .  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	HTTP	GET	request	builder	in Stoplight	with	the	code	generation	at	the	bottom:   Installing	iCurlHTTP  We	can	also	use	apps	that	can	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	from mobile	devices	to	work	with	our	RESTful	Web	Services.	For	example,	we can	work	with	the	iCurlHTTP	app	on	iOS	devices	such	as	iPad	and iPhone:	https:  itunes.apple.com us app icurlhttp id611943891.	On	Android devices,	we	can	work	with	the	HTTP	Request	app:	https:  play.google.com st ore apps details?id=air.http.request&hl=en.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	UI	for	the	iCurlHTTP	app	running	on an	iPad	Pro:   At	the	time	of	writing,	the	mobile	apps	that	allow	you	to	compose	and send	HTTP	requests	do	not	provide	all	the	features	you	can	find	in Postman	or	command-line	utilities.   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly:  1.	 After	we	activate	a	virtual	environment,	all	the	packages	we	install  with	pip	are	available:  1.	 For	all	the	virtual	environments	available	in	the	computer  or	device	that	is	running	Python  2.	 Only	for	the	activated	virtual	environment 3.	 For	all	the	virtual	environments	created	by	the	current  user  2.	 HTTPie	is	a:  1.	 Command-line	HTTP	server	written	in	Python	that	makes  it	easy	to	create	a	RESTful	Web	Server  2.	 Command-line	utility	that	allows	us	to	run	queries	against  an	SQLite	database  3.	 Command-line	HTTP	client	written	in	Python	that	makes  it	easy	to	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests  3.	 Which	of	the	following	commands	creates	a	new	app	named	books  in	Django?  1.	 django	startapp	books   4.	 In	Django,	a	subclass	of	which	of	the	following	classes	represents  a	Django	application	and	its	configuration?  2.	 python	django.py	startapp	books 3.	 python	manage.py	startapp	books  1.	 	django.apps.AppConfig 2.	 django.application.configuration 3.	 django.config.App  5.	 Which	of	the	following	strings	must	be	added	to	the	INSTALLED_APPS  string	list	in	the	settings.py	file	to	enable	Django	REST framework?  1.	 'rest_framework' 2.	 'django_rest_framework' 3.	 'Django_REST_framework'  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	learned	the	advantages	of	working	with	lightweight virtual	environments	in	Python	and	we	set	up	a	virtual	environment	with Django	and	Django	REST	framework.	We	created	an	app	with	Django,	we took	a	first	look	at	the	Django	folders,	files,	and	configurations,	and	we made	the	necessary	changes	to	activate	Django	REST	framework.  Then,	we	introduced	and	installed	command-line	and	GUI	tools	that	we will	use	to	interact	with	the	RESTful	Web	Services	that	we	will	design, code,	test,	and	run	in	the	forthcoming	chapters.  Now	that	we	have	our	environment	ready	to	start	working	with	Django REST	framework,	we	will	define	the	requirements	for	our	first	RESTful Web	Service	and	we	will	work	with	models,	migrations,	serialization,	and deserialization,	which	are	the	topics	that	we	are	going	to	discuss	in	the next	chapter.   Working	with	Models, Migrations,	Serialization,	and Deserialization  In	this	chapter,	we	will	define	the	requirements	for	our	first	RESTful	Web Service.	We	will	start	working	with	Django,	Django	REST	framework, Python,	configurations,	models,	migrations,	serialization,	and deserialization.	We	will	create	a	RESTful	Web	Service	that	performs CRUD	 short	for	Create,	Read,	Update	and	Delete 	operations	on	a simple	SQLite	database.	We	will	be:  Defining	the	requirements	for	our	first	RESTful	Web	Service  Creating	our	first	model  Running	our	initial	migration  Understanding	migrations  Analyzing	the	database  Understanding	Django	tables  Controlling,	serialization,	and	deserialization  Working	with	the	Django	shell	and	diving	deeply	into	serialization and	deserialization   Defining	the	requirements	for our	first	RESTful	Web	Service  Imagine	a	team	of	developers	working	on	a	mobile	app	for	iOS	and Android	and	requires	a	RESTful	Web	Service	to	perform	CRUD operations	with	toys.	We	definitely	don't	want	to	use	a	mock	web	service and	we	don't	want	to	spend	time	choosing	and	configuring	an	ORM	 short for	Object-Relational	Mapping .	We	want	to	quickly	build	a	RESTful Web	Service	and	have	it	ready	as	soon	as	possible	to	start	interacting	with it	in	the	mobile	app.  We	really	want	the	toys	to	persist	in	a	database	but	we	don't	need	it	to	be production-ready.	Therefore,	we	can	use	the	simplest	possible	relational database,	as	long	as	we	don't	have	to	spend	time	performing	complex installations	or	configurations.  Django	REST	framework,	also	known	as	DRF,	will	allow	us	to	easily accomplish	this	task	and	start	making	HTTP	requests	to	the	first	version	of our	RESTful	Web	Service.	In	this	case,	we	will	work	with	a	very	simple SQLite	database,	the	default	database	for	a	new	Django	REST	framework project.  First,	we	must	specify	the	requirements	for	our	main	resource:	a	toy.	We need	the	following	attributes	or	fields	for	a	toy	entity:  An	integer	identifier  A	name  An	optional	description  A	toy	category	description,	such	as	action	figures,	dolls,	or   playsets  A	release	date  A	bool	value	indicating	whether	the	toy	has	been	on	the	online store's	homepage	at	least	once  In	addition,	we	want	to	have	a	timestamp	with	the	date	and	time	of	the toy's	addition	to	the	database	table,	which	will	be	generated	to	persist	toys.  In	a	RESTful	Web	Service,	each	resource	has	its	own	unique	URL.	In	our web	service,	each	toy	will	have	its	own	unique	URL.  The	following	table	shows	the	HTTP	verbs,	the	scope,	and	the	semantics of	the	methods	that	our	first	version	of	the	web	service	must	support.	Each method	is	composed	of	an	HTTP	verb	and	a	scope.	All	the	methods	have	a well-defined	meaning	for	toys	and	collections:  HTTP verb  GET  GET  POST  Scope  Semantics  Toy  Retrieve	a	single	toy  Collection of	toys  Collection of	toys  Retrieve	all	the	stored	toys	in	the collection,	sorted	by	their	name	in ascending	order  Create	a	new	toy	in	the	collection  PUT  Toy  Update	an	existing	toy  DELETE Toy  Delete	an	existing	toy   	  In	the	previous	table,	the	GET	HTTP	verb	appears	twice	but	with	two different	scopes:	toys	and	collection	of	toys.	The	first	row	shows	a	GET HTTP	verb	applied	to	a	toy,	that	is,	to	a	single	resource.	The	second	row shows	a	GET	HTTP	verb	applied	to	a	collection	of	toys,	that	is,	to	a collection	of	resources.  We	want	our	web	service	to	be	able	to	differentiate	collections	from	a single	resource	of	the	collection	in	the	URLs.	When	we	refer	to	a collection,	we	will	use	a	slash	   	as	the	last	character	for	the	URL,	as	in http:  localhost:8000 toys .	When	we	refer	to	a	single	resource	of	the collection	we	won't	use	a	slash	   	as	the	last	character	for	the	URL,	as	in http:  localhost:8000 toys 5.  Let's	consider	that	http:  localhost:8000 toys 	is	the	URL	for	the	collection	of toys.	If	we	add	a	number	to	the	previous	URL,	we	identify	a	specific	toy with	an	ID	or	primary	key	equal	to	the	specified	numeric	value.	For example,	http:  localhost:8000 toys 42	identifies	the	toy	with	an	ID	equal	to 42.  We	have	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	with	the	POST	HTTP	verb and	http:  localhost:8000 toys 	request	URL	to	create	a	new	toy	and	add	it	to the	toys	collection.	In	this	example,	our	RESTful	Web	Service	will	work with	JSON	 short	for	JavaScript	Object	Notation ,	and	therefore	we have	to	provide	the	JSON	key-value	pairs	with	the	field	names	and	the values	to	create	the	new	toy.	As	a	result	of	the	request,	the	server	will validate	the	provided	values	for	the	fields,	make	sure	that	it	is	a	valid	toy, and	persist	it	in	the	database.	The	server	will	insert	a	new	row	with	the new	toy	in	the	appropriate	table	and	it	will	return	a	201	Created	status	code and	a	JSON	body	with	the	recently	added	toy	serialized	to	JSON, including	the	assigned	ID	that	was	automatically	generated	by	the database	and	assigned	to	the	toy	object:  POST	http:  localhost:8000 toys 	   We	have	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	with	the	GET	HTTP	verb and	http:  localhost:8000 toys {id}	request	URL	to	retrieve	the	toy	whose	ID matches	the	specified	numeric	value	in	{id}.	For	example,	if	we	use	the request	URL	http:  localhost:8000 toys 25,	the	server	will	retrieve	the	toy whose	ID	matches	25.	As	a	result	of	the	request,	the	server	will	retrieve	a toy	with	the	specified	ID	from	the	database	and	create	the	appropriate	toy object	in	Python.	If	a	toy	is	found,	the	server	will	serialize	the	toy	object into	JSON,	return	a	200	OK	status	code,	and	return	a	JSON	body	with	the serialized	toy	object.	If	no	toy	matches	the	specified	ID,	the	server	will return	only	a	404	Not	Found	status:  GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys {id}	  We	have	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	with	the	PUT	HTTP	verb and	request	URL	http:  localhost:8000 toys {id}	to	retrieve	the	toy	whose	ID matches	the	value	in	{id}	and	replace	it	with	a	toy	created	with	the provided	data.	In	addition,	we	have	to	provide	the	JSON	key-value	pairs with	the	field	names	and	the	values	to	create	the	new	toy	that	will	replace the	existing	one.	As	a	result	of	the	request,	the	server	will	validate	the provided	values	for	the	fields,	make	sure	that	it	is	a	valid	toy,	and	replace the	one	that	matches	the	specified	ID	with	the	new	one	in	the	database. The	ID	for	the	toy	will	be	the	same	after	the	update	operation.	The	server will	update	the	existing	row	in	the	appropriate	table	and	it	will	return	a	200 OK	status	code	and	a	JSON	body	with	the	recently	updated	toy	serialized	to JSON.	If	we	don't	provide	all	the	necessary	data	for	the	new	toy,	the	server will	return	a	400	Bad	Request	status	code.	If	the	server	doesn't	find	a	toy	with the	specified	ID,	the	server	will	only	return	a	404	Not	Found	status:  PUT	http:  localhost:8000 toys {id}  We	have	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	with	the	DELETE	HTTP	verb and	request	URL	http:  localhost:8000 toys {id}	to	remove	the	toy	whose ID	matches	the	specified	numeric	value	in	{id}.	For	example,	if	we	use	the request	URL	http:  localhost:8000 toys 34,	the	server	will	delete	the	toy whose	ID	matches	34.	As	a	result	of	the	request,	the	server	will	retrieve	a   toy	with	the	specified	ID	from	the	database	and	create	the	appropriate	toy object	in	Python.	If	a	toy	is	found,	the	server	will	request	the	ORM	delete the	toy	row	associated	with	this	toy	object	and	the	server	will	return	a	204 No	Content	status	code.	If	no	toy	matches	the	specified	ID,	the	server	will return	only	a	404	Not	Found	status:  DELETE	http:  localhost:8000 toys {id}	   Creating	our	first	model  Now,	we	will	create	a	simple	Toy	model	in	Django,	which	we	will	use	to represent	and	persist	toys.	Open	the	toys models.py	file.	The	following	lines show	the	initial	code	for	this	file	with	just	one	import	statement	and	a comment	that	indicates	we	should	create	the	models:  from	django.db	import	models	 	 	Create	your	models	here.	  The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	that	creates	a	Toy	class,	specifically, a	Toy	model	in	the	toys models.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder	in	the	restful01 toys models.py file:  from	django.db	import	models	 	 	 class	Toy models.Model :	 				created	=	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True 	 				name	=	models.CharField max_length=150,	blank=False,	default='' 	 				description	=	models.CharField max_length=250,	blank=True,	default='' 	 				toy_category	=	models.CharField max_length=200,	blank=False,	default='' 	 				release_date	=	models.DateTimeField  	 				was_included_in_home	=	models.BooleanField default=False 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name',   The	Toy	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	django.db.models.Model	class	and	defines	the following	attributes:	created,	name,	description,	toy_category,	release_date,	and was_included_in_home.	Each	of	these	attributes	represents	a	database	column or	field.   Django	automatically	adds	an	auto-increment	integer primary	key	column	named	id	when	it	creates	the	database table	related	to	the	model.	It	is	very	important	to	notice	that the	model	maps	the	underlying	id	column	in	an	attribute named	pk	for	the	model.  We	specified	the	field	types,	maximum	lengths,	and	defaults	for	many attributes.	The	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	an	ordering attribute	and	sets	its	value	to	a	tuple	of	string	whose	first	value	is	the	'name' string.	This	way,	the	inner	class	indicates	to	Django	that,	by	default,	we want	the	results	ordered	by	the	name	attribute	in	ascending	order.   Running	our	initial	migration  Now,	it	is	necessary	to	create	the	initial	migration	for	the	new	Toy	model we	recently	coded.	We	will	also	synchronize	the	SQLite	database	for	the first	time.	By	default,	Django	uses	the	popular	self-contained	and embedded	SQLite	database,	and	therefore	we	don't	need	to	make	changes in	the	initial	ORM	configuration.	In	this	example,	we	will	be	working	with this	default	configuration.	Of	course,	we	will	upgrade	to	another	database after	we	have	a	sample	web	service	built	with	Django.	We	will	only	use SQLite	for	this	example.  We	just	need	to	run	the	following	Python	script	in	the	virtual	environment that	we	activated	in	the	previous	chapter.	Make	sure	you	are	in	the	restful01 folder	within	the	main	folder	for	the	virtual	environment	when	you	run	the following	command:  				python	manage.py	makemigrations	toys		  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command:  				Migrations	for	'toys': 						toys migrations 0001_initial.py: 								-	Create	model	Toy  The	output	indicates	that	the	restful01 toys migrations 0001_initial.py	file includes	the	code	to	create	the	Toy	model.	The	following	lines	show	the code	for	this	file	that	was	automatically	generated	by	Django.	The	code file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder	in	the restful01 toys migrations 0001_initial.py	file:   	-*-	coding:	utf-8	-*-	 	Generated	by	Django	1.11.5	on	2017-10-08	05:19	 from	__future__	import	unicode_literals	 	 from	django.db	import	migrations,	models	 	 	 class	Migration migrations.Migration :	 	 				initial	=	True	 	 				dependencies	=	[	 				]	 	 				operations	=	[	 								migrations.CreateModel 	 												name='Toy',	 												fields=[	 																 'id',	models.AutoField auto_created=True,	primary_key=True,	serialize=False,	verbose_name='ID'  ,	 																 'created',	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True  ,	 																 'name',	models.CharField default='',	max_length=150  ,	 																 'description',	models.CharField blank=True,	default='',	max_length=250  ,	 																 'toy_category',	models.CharField default='',	max_length=200  ,	 																 'release_date',	models.DateTimeField   ,	 																 'was_included_in_home',	models.BooleanField default=False  ,	 												],	 												options={	 																'ordering':	 'name', ,	 												},	 								 ,	 				]	   Understanding	migrations  The	automatically	generated	code	defines	a	subclass	of	the django.db.migrations.Migration	class	named	Migration,	which	defines	an operation	that	creates	the	Toy	model's	table	and	includes	it	in	the	operations attribute.	The	call	to	the	migrations.CreateModel	method	specifies	the	model's name,	the	fields,	and	the	options	to	instruct	the	ORM	to	create	a	table	that will	allow	the	underlying	database	to	persist	the	model.  The	fields	argument	is	a	list	of	tuples	that	includes	information	about	the field	name,	the	field	type,	and	additional	attributes	based	on	the	data	we provided	in	our	model,	that	is,	in	the	Toy	class.  Now,	run	the	following	Python	script	to	apply	all	the	generated migrations.	Make	sure	you	are	in	the	restful01	folder	within	the	main	folder for	the	virtual	environment	when	you	run	the	following	command:  				python	manage.py	migrate  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command:  				Operations	to	perform: 						Apply	all	migrations:	admin,	auth,	contenttypes,	sessions,	toys 				Running	migrations: 						Applying	contenttypes.0001_initial...	OK 						Applying	auth.0001_initial...	OK 						Applying	admin.0001_initial...	OK 						Applying	admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add...	OK 						Applying	contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name...

OK 						Applying	auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length...	OK 						Applying	sessions.0001_initial...	OK 						Applying	toys.0001_initial...	OK 		  After	we	run	the	previous	command,	we	will	notice	that	the	root	folder	for our	restful01	project	now	has	a	db.sqlite3	file	that	contains	the	SQLite database.	We	can	use	the	SQLite	command	line	or	any	other	application that	allows	us	to	easily	check	the	contents	of	the	SQLite	database	to	check the	tables	that	Django	generated.  The	first	migration	will	generate	many	tables	required	by	Django	and	its installed	apps	before	running	the	code	that	creates	the	table	for	the	Toys model.	These	tables	provide	support	for	user	authentication,	permissions, groups,	logs,	and	migration	management.	We	will	work	with	the	models related	to	these	tables	after	we	add	more	features	and	security	to	our	web services.  After	the	migration	process	creates	all	these	Django	tables	in	the underlying	database,	the	first	migration	runs	the	Python	code	that	creates the	table	required	to	persist	our	model.	Thus,	the	last	line	of	the	running migrations	section	displays	Applying	toys.0001_initial.   Analyzing	the	database  In	most	modern	Linux	distributions	and	macOS,	SQLite	is	already installed,	and	therefore	you	can	run	the	sqlite3	command-line	utility.  In	Windows,	if	you	want	to	work	with	the	sqlite3.exe	command-line	utility, you	have	to	download	the	bundle	of	command-line	tools	for	managing SQLite	database	files	from	the	downloads	section	of	the	SQLite	webpage at	http:  www.sqlite.org download.html.	For	example,	the	ZIP	file	that	includes the	command-line	tools	for	version	3.20.1	is	sqlite-tools-win32-x8	6- 3200100.zip.	The	name	for	the	file	changes	with	the	SQLite	version.	You just	need	to	make	sure	that	you	download	the	bundle	of	command-line tools	and	not	the	ZIP	file	that	provides	the	SQLite	DLLs.	After	you	unzip the	file,	you	can	include	the	folder	that	includes	the	command-line	tools	in the	PATH	environment	variable,	or	you	can	access	the	sqlite3.exe command-line	utility	by	specifying	the	full	path	to	it.  Run	the	following	command	to	list	the	generated	tables.	The	first argument,	db.sqlite3,	specifies	the	file	that	contains	that	SQLite	database and	the	second	argument	indicates	the	command	that	we	want	the	sqlite3 command-line	utility	to	run	against	the	specified	database:  				sqlite3	db.sqlite3	".tables"	  The	following	lines	show	the	output	for	the	previous	command	with	the list	of	tables	that	Django	generated	in	the	SQLite	database:  				auth_group																		django_admin_log 				auth_group_permissions						django_content_type 				auth_permission													django_migrations 				auth_user																			django_session 				auth_user_groups												toys_toy 				auth_user_user_permissions		   The	following	command	will	allow	you	to	check	the	contents	of	the toys_toy	table	after	we	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	to	the	RESTful Web	Service	and	the	web	service	makes	CRUD	operations	to	the	toys_toy table:  				sqlite3	db.sqlite3	"SELECT	*	FROM	toys_toy	ORDER	BY	name;"	  Instead	of	working	with	the	SQLite	command-line	utility,	you	can	use	a GUI	tool	to	check	the	contents	of	the	SQLite	database.	DB	Browser	for SQLite	is	a	useful,	free,	multiplatform	GUI	tool	that	allows	us	to	easily check	the	database	contents	of	an	SQLite	database	in	Linux,	macOS,	and Windows.	You	can	read	more	information	about	this	tool	and	download	its different	versions	from	http:  sqlitebrowser.org.	Once	you	have	installed	the tool,	you	just	need	to	open	the	db.sqlite3	file	and	you	can	check	the database	structure	and	browse	the	data	for	the	different	tables.	After	we start	working	with	the	first	version	of	our	web	service,	you	need	to	check the	contents	of	the	toys_toy	table	with	this	tool.  You	can	also	use	the	database	tools	included	with	your favorite	IDE	to	check	the	contents	of	the	SQLite	database.  The	SQLite	database	engine	and	the	database	file	name	are	specified	in	the restful01 settings.py	Python	file.	The	following	lines	show	the	declaration of	the	DATABASES	dictionary,	which	contains	the	settings	for	all	the databases	that	Django	uses.	The	nested	dictionary	maps	the	database named	default	with	the	django.db.backends.sqlite3	database	engine	and	the db.sqlite3	database	file	located	in	the	BASE_DIR	folder	 restful01 :  DATABASES	=	{	 				'default':	{	 								'ENGINE':	'django.db.backends.sqlite3',	 								'NAME':	os.path.join BASE_DIR,	'db.sqlite3' ,	 				}	 }	   After	we	execute	the	migrations,	the	SQLite	database	will	have	the following	tables.	Django	uses	prefixes	to	identify	the	modules	and applications	that	each	table	belongs	to.	The	tables	that	start	with	the	auth_ prefix	belong	to	the	Django	authentication	module.	The	table	that	starts with	the	toys_	prefix	belongs	to	our	toys	application.	If	we	add	more	models to	our	toys	application,	Django	will	create	new	tables	with	the	toys_	prefix:  auth_group:	Stores	authentication	groups  auth_group_permissions:	Stores	permissions	for	authentication	groups  auth_permission:	Stores	permissions	for	authentication  auth_user:	Stores	authentication	users  auth_user_groups:	Stores	authentication	user	groups  auth_user_groups_permissions:	Stores	permissions	for	authentication user	groups  django_admin_log:	Stores	the	Django	administrator	log  django_content_type:	Stores	Django	content	types  django_migrations:	Stores	the	scripts	generated	by	Django	migrations and	the	date	and	time	at	which	they	were	applied  django_session:	Stores	Django	sessions  toys_toy:	Persists	the	Toys	model  sqlite_sequence:	Stores	sequences	for	SQLite	primary	keys	with autoincrement	fields   Understanding	the	table generated	by	Django  The	toys_toy	table	persists	in	the	database	the	Toy	class	we	recently	created, specifically,	the	Toy	model.	Django's	integrated	ORM	generated	the	toys_toy table	based	on	our	Toy	model.  Run	the	following	command	to	retrieve	the	SQL	used	to	create	the	toys_toy table:  				sqlite3	db.sqlite3	".schema	toys_toy"  The	following	lines	show	the	output	for	the	previous	command	together with	the	SQL	that	the	migrations	process	executed,	to	create	the	toys_toy table	that	persists	the	Toy	model.	The	next	lines	are	formatted	to	make	it easier	to	understand	the	SQL	code.	Notice	that	the	output	from	the command	is	formatted	in	a	different	way:  				CREATE	TABLE	IF	NOT	EXISTS	"toys_toy"	 				  								"id"	integer	NOT	NULL	PRIMARY	KEY	AUTOINCREMENT, 								"created"	datetime	NOT	NULL,	 								"name"	varchar 150 	NOT	NULL,	 								"description"	varchar 250 	NOT	NULL,	 								"toy_category"	varchar 200 	NOT	NULL,	 								"release_date"	datetime	NOT	NULL,	 								"was_included_in_home"	bool	NOT	NULL 				 ; 		  The	toys_toy	table	has	the	following	columns	 also	known	as	fields 	with their	SQLite	types,	all	of	them	not	nullable:   id:	The	integer	primary	key,	an	autoincrement	row  created:	DateTime  name:	varchar 150   description:	varchar 250   toy_category:	varchar 200   release_date:	DateTime  was_included_in_home:	bool   Controlling,	serialization,	and deserialization  Our	RESTful	Web	Service	has	to	be	able	to	serialize	and	deserialize	the Toy	instances	into	JSON	representations.	In	Django	REST	framework,	we just	need	to	create	a	serializer	class	for	the	Toy	instances	to	manage serialization	to	JSON	and	deserialization	from	JSON.	Now,	we	will	dive deep	into	the	serialization	and	deserialization	process	in	Django	REST framework.	It	is	very	important	to	understand	how	it	works	because	it	is one	of	the	most	important	components	for	all	the	RESTful	Web	Services we	will	build.  Django	REST	framework	uses	a	two-phase	process	for	serialization.	The serializers	are	mediators	between	the	model	instances	and	Python primitives.	Parser	and	renderers	handle	as	mediators	between	Python primitives	and	HTTP	requests	and	responses.	We	will	configure	our mediator	between	the	Toy	model	instances	and	Python	primitives	by creating	a	subclass	of	the	rest_framework.serializers.Serializer	class	to	declare the	fields	and	the	necessary	methods	to	manage	serialization	and deserialization.  We	will	repeat	some	of	the	information	about	the	fields	that	we	have included	in	the	Toy	model	so	that	we	understand	all	the	things	that	we	can configure	in	a	subclass	of	the	Serializer	class.	However,	we	will	work	with shortcuts,	which	will	reduce	boilerplate	code	later	in	the	following examples.	We	will	write	less	code	in	the	following	examples	by	using	the ModelSerializer	class.  Now,	go	to	the	restful01 toys	folder	and	create	a	new	Python	code	file named	serializers.py.	The	following	lines	show	the	code	that	declares	the new	ToySerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder	in	the	restful01 toys serializers.py	file:   from	rest_framework	import	serializers	 from	toys.models	import	Toy	 	 	 class	ToySerializer serializers.Serializer :	 				pk	=	serializers.IntegerField read_only=True 	 				name	=	serializers.CharField max_length=150 	 				description	=	serializers.CharField max_length=250 	 				release_date	=	serializers.DateTimeField  	 				toy_category	=	serializers.CharField max_length=200 	 				was_included_in_home	=	serializers.BooleanField required=False 	 	 				def	create self,	validated_data :	 								return	Toy.objects.create **validated_data 	 	 				def	update self,	instance,	validated_data :	 								instance.name	=	validated_data.get 'name',	instance.name 									 								instance.description	=	validated_data.get 'description',	instance.description 	 								instance.release_date	=	validated_data.get 'release_date',	instance.release_date 	 								instance.toy_category	=	validated_data.get 'toy_category',	instance.toy_category 	 								instance.was_included_in_home	=	validated_data.get 'was_included_in_home',	instance.was_included_in_home 	 								instance.save  	 								return	instance	  The	ToySerializer	class	declares	the	attributes	that	represent	the	fields	that we	want	to	be	serialized.	Notice	that	we	have	omitted	the	created	attribute that	was	present	in	the	Toy	model.	When	there	is	a	call	to	the	save	method that	ToySerializer	inherits	from	the	serializers.Serializer	superclass,	the overridden	create	and	update	methods	define	how	to	create	a	new	instance or	update	an	existing	instance.	In	fact,	these	methods	must	be implemented	in	our	class	because	they	only	raise	a	NotImplementedError exception	in	their	base	declaration	in	the	serializers.Serializer	superclass.  The	create	method	receives	the	validated	data	in	the	validated_data argument.	The	code	creates	and	returns	a	new	Toy	instance	based	on	the received	validated	data.  The	update	method	receives	an	existing	Toy	instance	that	is	being	updated and	the	new	validated	data	in	the	instance	and	validated_data	arguments.	The code	updates	the	values	for	the	attributes	of	the	instance	with	the	updated attribute	values	retrieved	from	the	validated	data.	Finally,	the	code	calls   the	save	method	for	the	updated	Toy	instance	and	returns	the	updated	and saved	instance.   Working	with	the	Django	shell and	diving	deeply	into serialization	and deserialization  We	can	launch	our	default	Python	interactive	shell	in	our	virtual environment	and	make	all	the	Django	project	modules	available	before	it starts.	This	way,	we	can	check	that	the	serializer	works	as	expected.	We will	do	this	to	understand	how	serialization	works	in	Django.  Run	the	following	command	to	launch	the	interactive	shell.	Make	sure	you are	within	the	restful01	folder	in	the	terminal,	Command	Prompt,	or Windows	Powershell:  python	manage.py	shell  You	will	notice	a	line	that	says	 InteractiveConsole 	is	displayed	after	the usual	lines	that	introduce	your	default	Python	interactive	shell.	The following	screenshot	shows	the	Django	shell	launched	in	a	Windows command	prompt:  Enter	the	following	code	in	the	Python	interactive	shell	to	import	all	the things	we	will	need	to	test	the	Toy	model	and	its	serializer.	The	code	file	for   toy_release_date	=	timezone.make_aware datetime.now  ,	timezone.get_current_timezone   	 toy1	=	Toy name='Snoopy	talking	action	figure',	description='Snoopy	speaks	five	languages',	release_date=toy_release_date,	toy_category='Action	figures',	was_included_in_home=False 	 toy1.save  	 toy2	=	Toy name='Hawaiian	Barbie',	description='Barbie	loves	Hawaii',	release_date=toy_release_date,	toy_category='Dolls',	was_included_in_home=True 	 toy2.save  	  the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py	file:  from	datetime	import	datetime	 from	django.utils	import	timezone	 from	django.utils.six	import	BytesIO	 from	rest_framework.renderers	import	JSONRenderer	 from	rest_framework.parsers	import	JSONParser	 from	toys.models	import	Toy	 from	toys.serializers	import	ToySerializer	  Enter	the	following	code	to	create	two	instances	of	the	Toy	model	and	save them.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py file:  After	we	execute	the	preceding	code,	we	can	check	the	SQLite	database with	the	previously	introduced	command-line	or	GUI	tools	to	check	the contents	of	the	toys_toy	table.	We	will	notice	the	table	has	two	rows	and columns	with	the	values	we	have	provided	to	the	different	attributes	of	the Toy	instances.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	results	of	browsing	the data	of	the	toys_toy	table	with	the	DB	Browser	for	SQLite	GUI	utility.	We can	see	that	two	rows	were	inserted.  Enter	the	following	code	in	the	interactive	shell	to	check	the	values	for	the primary	keys	or	identifiers	for	the	saved	Toy	instances,	and	the	value	of their	name	and	was_included_in_home_attribute	attributes.	The	code	also	checks the	value	of	the	created	attribute,	which	includes	the	date	and	time	at	which Django	saved	each	instance	to	the	database.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py	file:   print toy1.pk 	 print toy1.name 	 print toy1.created 	 print toy1.was_included_in_home 	 print toy2.pk 	 print toy2.name 	 print toy2.created 	 print toy2.was_included_in_home   The	following	screenshot	shows	sample	results	of	the	previously	shown code:  Now,	let's	write	the	following	code	to	serialize	the	first	Toy	instance	 toy1 . The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py	file:  serializer_for_toy1	=	ToySerializer toy1 	 print serializer_for_toy1.data 	  The	following	lines	show	the	generated	dictionary,	specifically,	a rest_framework.utils.serializer_helpers.ReturnDict	instance,	stored	in	the serializer_for_toy1.data	attribute.	The	next	lines	show	the	results	with	easily understood	formatting:  				{ 								'pk':	1,	 								'name':	'Snoopy	talking	action	figure',	 								'description':	'Snoopy	speaks	five	languages',	 								'release_date':	'2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z',	 								'toy_category':	'Action	figures',	 								'was_included_in_home':	False 				}   Now,	let's	serialize	the	second	Toy	instance	 toy2 .	The	code	file	for	the sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py	file:  serializer_for_toy2	=	ToySerializer toy2 	 print serializer_for_toy2.data   The	following	lines	show	the	generated	dictionary	stored	in	the serializer_for_toy2.data	attribute.	The	next	lines	show	the	results	with	easily understood	formatting:  				{ 								'pk':	2,	 								'name':	'Hawaiian	Barbie',	 								'description':	'Barbie	loves	Hawaii',	 								'release_date':	'2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z',	 								'toy_category':	'Dolls',	 								'was_included_in_home':	True 				}		  We	can	easily	render	the	dictionaries	held	in	the	data	attribute	into	JSON with	the	help	of	the	rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer	class.	The	following lines	create	an	instance	of	this	class	and	then	call	the	render	method	to render	the	dictionaries	held	in	the	data	attribute	into	JSON.	The	code	file for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py	file:  json_renderer	=	JSONRenderer  	 toy1_rendered_into_json	=	json_renderer.render serializer_for_toy1.data 	 toy2_rendered_into_json	=	json_renderer.render serializer_for_toy2.data 	 print toy1_rendered_into_json 	 print toy2_rendered_into_json 	  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	from	the	two	calls	to	the render	method:   				b'{"pk":1,"name":"Snoopy	talking	action	figure","description":"Snoopy	speaks	five	languages","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z","toy_category":"Action	figures","was_included_in_home":false}' 				>>>	print toy2_rendered_into_json  				b'{"pk":2,"name":"Hawaiian	Barbie","description":"Barbie	loves	Hawaii","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z","toy_category":"Dolls","was_included_in_home":true}'  json_string_for_new_toy	=	'{"name":"Clash	Royale	play	set","description":"6	figures	from	Clash	Royale",	"release_date":"2017-10-09T12:10:00.776594Z","toy_category":"Playset","was_included_in_home":false}'	 json_bytes_for_new_toy	=	bytes json_string_for_new_toy,	encoding="UTF-8" 	 stream_for_new_toy	=	BytesIO json_bytes_for_new_toy 	 parser	=	JSONParser  	 parsed_new_toy	=	parser.parse stream_for_new_toy 	 print parsed_new_toy 	  Now,	we	will	work	in	the	opposite	direction:	from	serialized	data	to	the population	of	a	Toy	instance.	The	following	lines	generate	a	new	Toy instance	from	a	JSON	string	 serialized	data ,	that	is,	the	code	deserializes and	parses	the	data.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py file:  The	first	line	creates	a	new	string	with	the	JSON	that	defines	a	new	toy  json_string_for_new_toy .	The	next	line	converts	the	string	to	bytes	and	saves the	results	of	the	conversion	in	the	json_bytes_for_new_toy	variable.	The django.utils.six.BytesIO	class	provides	a	buffered	I O	implementation	using an	in-memory	bytes	buffer.	The	code	uses	this	class	to	create	a	stream from	the	previously	generated	JSON	bytes	with	the	serialized	data, json_bytes_for_new_toy,	and	saves	the	generated	stream	instance	in	the stream_for_new_toy	variable.  We	can	easily	deserialize	and	parse	a	stream	into	a	Python	model	with	the help	of	the	rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser	class.	The	next	line	creates	an instance	of	this	class	and	then	calls	the	parse	method	with	stream_for_new_toy as	an	argument,	parses	the	stream	into	Python	native	datatypes,	and	saves the	results	in	the	parsed_new_toy	variable.  After	executing	the	previous	lines,	parsed_new_toy	holds	a	Python	dictionary, parsed	from	the	stream.	The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated after	executing	the	preceding	code	snippet.	The	next	lines	show	the	results   with	easily	understood	formatting:  							{ 				 				 										'name':	'Clash	Royale	play	set',	 				 				 										'description':	'6	figures	from	Clash	Royale',	 				 				 										'release_date':	'2017-10-09T12:10:00.776594Z',	 				 				 										'toy_category':	'Playset',	 				 				 										'was_included_in_home':	False 				 				 						}	  The	following	lines	use	the	ToySerializer	class	to	generate	a	fully	populated Toy	instance	named	toy3	from	the	Python	dictionary,	parsed	from	the stream.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_02_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 toy_serializers_test_01.py file:  new_toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer data=parsed_new_toy 	 if	new_toy_serializer.is_valid  :	 				toy3	=	new_toy_serializer.save  	 				print toy3.name   First,	the	code	creates	an	instance	of	the	ToySerializer	class	with	the	Python dictionary	that	we	previously	parsed	from	the	stream	 parsed_new_toy 	passed as	the	data	keyword	argument.	Then,	the	code	calls	the	is_valid	method	to check	whether	the	data	is	valid.  Note	that	we	must	always	call	is_valid	before	we	attempt	to access	the	serialized	data	representation	when	we	pass	a	data   keyword	argument	in	the	creation	of	a	serializer.  If	the	method	returns	true,	we	can	access	the	serialized	representation	in the	data	attribute,	and	therefore,	the	code	calls	the	save	method	that	persists the	new	instance.	In	this	case,	it	is	a	new	Toy	instance,	and	therefore	the code	to	the	save	method	inserts	the	corresponding	row	in	the	database	and returns	a	fully	populated	Toy	instance,	saved	in	the	toy3	local	variable. Then,	the	code	prints	one	of	the	attributes	from	the	fully	populated	Toy instance.	After	executing	the	previous	code,	we	fully	populated	a	new	Toy instance:	toy3.  As	we	can	see	from	the	previous	code,	Django	REST framework	makes	it	easy	to	serialize	from	objects	to	JSON and	deserialize	from	JSON	to	objects,	which	are	core requirements	for	our	RESTful	Web	Service	that	has	to perform	CRUD	operations.  Enter	the	following	command	to	leave	the	Django	shell	with	the	Django project	modules	that	we	loaded	to	test	serialization	and	deserialization:  quit  	   Test	your	knowledge  1.

Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	designed	a	RESTful	Web	Service	to	interact	with	a simple	SQLite	database	and	perform	CRUD	operations	with	toys.	We defined	the	requirements	for	our	web	service	and	we	understood	the	tasks performed	by	each	HTTP	method	and	the	different	scopes.  We	created	a	model	to	represent	and	persist	toys,	and	we	executed migrations	in	Django	to	create	the	required	tables	in	an	SQLite	database. We	analyzed	the	tables	that	Django	generated.	We	learned	to	manage serialization	of	toy	instances	into	JSON	representations	with	Django REST	framework	and	the	reverse	process.  Now	that	we	understand	models,	migrations,	serialization,	and deserialization	with	Django	and	Django	REST	framework,	we	will	create Django	views	combined	with	serializer	classes	and	start	making	HTTP requests	to	our	web	service.	We	will	cover	these	topics	in	Chapter	3, Creating	API	Views.   Creating	API	Views  In	this	chapter,	we	have	to	run	our	first	version	of	a	RESTful	Web	Service powered	by	Django.	We	will	write	API	views	to	process	different	HTTP requests	and	we	will	perform	HTTP	requests	with	command-line	and	GUI tools.	We	will	analyze	how	Django	and	Django	REST	framework	process each	HTTP	request.	We	will	gain	an	understanding	of:  Creating	Django	views	combined	with	serializer	classes  CRUD	operations	with	Django	views	and	the	request	methods  Launching	Django's	development	server  Making	HTTP	GET	requests	that	target	a	collection	of	instances with	command-line	tools  Making	HTTP	GET	requests	that	target	a	single	instance	with command-line	tools  Making	HTTP	GET	requests	with	command-line	tools  Making	HTTP	POST	requests	with	command-line	tools  Making	HTTP	PUT	requests	with	command-line	tools  Making	HTTP	DELETE	requests	with	command-line	tools  Making	HTTP	GET	requests	with	Postman						  Making	HTTP	POST	requests	with	Postman   Creating	Django	views combined	with	serializer classes  We	have	created	the	necessary	model	and	its	serializer.	It	is	time	to	code the	necessary	elements	to	process	HTTP	requests	and	produce	HTTP responses.	Now,	we	will	create	Django	views	that	use	the	ToySerializer class	that	we	created	previously	to	return	JSON	representations	of	the entities	for	each	HTTP	request	that	our	web	service	will	handle.	Open	the toys views.py	file.	The	following	lines	show	the	initial	code	for	this	file	with just	one	import	statement	and	a	comment	that	indicates	we	should	create the	views:  from	django.shortcuts	import	render	 	 	Create	your	views	here.	  We	will	create	our	first	version	of	the	web	service	and	we	will	use functions	to	keep	the	code	as	simple	as	possible.	We	will	work	with classes	and	more	complex	code	in	later	examples.	First,	it	is	very important	to	understand	how	Django	and	Django	REST	framework	work by	way	of	a	simple	example.  Now,	write	the	following	lines	in	the	restful01 toys views.py	file	to	create	a JSONResponse	class	and	declare	two	functions:	toy_list	and	toy_detail.	The code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_03_01	folder, in	the	restful01 toys views.py	file:  from	django.shortcuts	import	render	 from	django.http	import	HttpResponse	 from	django.views.decorators.csrf	import	csrf_exempt	   from	rest_framework.renderers	import	JSONRenderer	 from	rest_framework.parsers	import	JSONParser	 from	rest_framework	import	status	 from	toys.models	import	Toy	 from	toys.serializers	import	ToySerializer	 	 	 class	JSONResponse HttpResponse :	 				def	__init__ self,	data,	**kwargs :	 								content	=	JSONRenderer  .render data 	 								kwargs['content_type']	=	'application json'	 								super JSONResponse,	self .__init__ content,	**kwargs 	 	 	 @csrf_exempt	 def	toy_list request :	 				if	request.method	==	'GET':	 								toys	=	Toy.objects.all  	 								toys_serializer	=	ToySerializer toys,	many=True 	 								return	JSONResponse toys_serializer.data 	 	 				elif	request.method	==	'POST':	 								toy_data	=	JSONParser  .parse request 	 								toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer data=toy_data 	 								if	toy_serializer.is_valid  :	 												toy_serializer.save  	 												return	JSONResponse toy_serializer.data,	\ 																status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED 	 								return	JSONResponse toy_serializer.errors,	\ 												status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST 	 	 	 @csrf_exempt	 def	toy_detail request,	pk :	 				try:	 								toy	=	Toy.objects.get pk=pk 	 				except	Toy.DoesNotExist:	 								return	HttpResponse status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND 	 	 				if	request.method	==	'GET':	 								toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer toy 	 								return	JSONResponse toy_serializer.data 	 	 				elif	request.method	==	'PUT':	 								toy_data	=	JSONParser  .parse request 	 								toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer toy,	data=toy_data 	 								if	toy_serializer.is_valid  :	 												toy_serializer.save  	 												return	JSONResponse toy_serializer.data 	 								return	JSONResponse toy_serializer.errors,	\   												status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST 	 	 				elif	request.method	==	'DELETE':	 								toy.delete  	 								return	HttpResponse status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT 	  The	highlighted	lines	show	the	expressions	that	evaluate	the	value	of	the request.method	attribute	to	determine	the	actions	to	be	performed	based	on the	HTTP	verb.	The	JSONResponse	class	is	a	subclass	of	the django.http.HttpResponse	class.	The	django.http.HttpResponse	superclass represents	an	HTTP	response	with	string	content.  The	JSONResponse	class	renders	its	content	in	JSON.	The	class	just	declares the	__init__	method	that	creates	a	rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer instance	and	calls	its	render	method	to	render	the	received	data	in	JSON and	save	the	returned	byte	string	in	the	content	local	variable.	Then,	the code	adds	the	'content_type'	key	to	the	response	header	with 'application json'	as	its	value.	Finally,	the	code	calls	the	initializer	for	the base	class	with	the	JSON	byte	string	and	the	key-value	pair	added	to	the header.	This	way,	the	class	represents	a	JSON	response	that	we	use	in	the two	functions	to	easily	return	a	JSON	response	in	each	HTTP	request	our web	service	will	process.	Since	Django	1.7,	the	django.http.JsonResponse class	has	accomplished	the	same	goal.	However,	we	created	our	own	class for	educational	purposes	in	this	example	as	well	as	to	understand	the difference	between	an	HttpResponse	and	a	JSONResponse.  The	code	uses	the	@csrf_exempt	decorator	in	the	two	functions	to	ensure	that the	view	sets	a	CSRF	 short	for	Cross-Site	Request	Forgery 	cookie.	We do	this	to	make	it	easier	to	test	this	example,	which	doesn't	represent	a production-ready	web	service.	We	will	add	security	features	to	our RESTful	Web	Service	later.	Of	course,	it	is	very	important	to	understand that	we	should	never	put	a	web	service	into	production	before	configuring security	and	throttling	rules.  Note	that	the	previous	code	has	many	problems	that	we	will analyze	and	fix	in	the	forthcoming	chapters.	However,	first, we	need	to	understand	how	some	basic	things	work.   Understanding	CRUD operations	with	Django	views and	the	request	methods  When	the	Django	server	receives	an	HTTP	request,	Django	creates	an HttpRequest	instance,	specifically	a	django.http.HttpRequest	object.	This instance	contains	metadata	about	the	request,	and	this	metadata	includes an	HTTP	verb	such	as	GET,	POST,	or	PUT.	The	method	attribute	provides	a string	representing	the	HTTP	verb	or	method	used	in	the	request.  When	Django	loads	the	appropriate	view	that	will	process	the	request,	it passes	the	HttpRequest	instance	as	the	first	argument	to	the	view	function.	The view	function	has	to	return	an	HttpResponse	instance,	specifically	a django.http.HttpResponse	instance.  The	toy_list	function	lists	all	the	toys	or	creates	a	new	toy.	The	function receives	an	HttpRequest	instance	in	the	request	argument.	The	function	is capable	of	processing	two	HTTP	verbs:	GET	and	POST.	The	code	checks	the value	of	the	request.method	attribute	to	determine	the	code	to	be	executed based	on	the	HTTP	verb.  If	the	HTTP	verb	is	GET,	the	expression	request.method	==	'GET'	will	evaluate to	True	and	the	code	has	to	list	all	the	toys.	The	code	will	retrieve	all	the	Toy objects	from	the	database,	use	the	ToySerializer	to	serialize	all	of	them	and return	a	JSONResponse	instance	built	with	the	data	generated	by	the ToySerializer	serializer.	The	code	creates	the	ToySerializer	instance	with	the many=True	argument	to	specify	that	multiple	instances	have	to	be	serialized and	not	just	one.	Under	the	hood,	Django	uses	a	ListSerializer	instance when	the	many	argument	value	is	set	to	True.	This	way,	Django	is	capable	of serializing	a	list	of	objects.   If	the	HTTP	verb	is	POST,	the	code	has	to	create	a	new	toy	based	on	the JSON	data	that	is	included	in	the	body	of	the	HTTP	request.	First,	the code	uses	a	JSONParser	instance	and	calls	its	parse	method	with	the	request parameter	that	the	toy_list	function	receives	as	an	argument	to	parse	the toy	data	provided	as	JSON	data	in	the	request	body	and	saves	the	results	in the	toy_data	local	variable.	Then,	the	code	creates	a	ToySerializer	instance with	the	previously	retrieved	data	and	calls	the	is_valid	method	to determine	whether	the	Toy	instance	is	valid	or	not.	If	the	instance	is	valid, the	code	calls	the	save	method	to	persist	the	instance	in	the	database	and returns	a	JSONResponse	with	the	saved	data	in	its	body	and	a	status	equal	to status.HTTP_201_CREATED,	that	is,	201	Created.  Whenever	we	have	to	return	a	specific	status	different	from the	default	200	OK	status,	it	is	a	good	practice	to	use	the module	variables	defined	in	the	rest_framework.status	module and	avoid	using	hard-coded	numeric	values.	If	you	see status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,	as	in	the	sample	code,	it	is	easy to	understand	that	the	status	is	an	HTTP	201	Created	status.	If you	read	status=201,	you	have	to	remember	what	the	number 201	stands	for	in	the	HTTP	status	codes.  The	toy_detail	function	retrieves,	updates,	or	deletes	an	existing	toy.	The function	receives	an	HttpRequest	instance	in	the	request	argument	and	the identifier	for	the	toy	to	be	retrieved,	updated,	or	deleted	in	the	pk	argument. The	function	is	capable	of	processing	three	HTTP	verbs:	GET,	PUT,	and DELETE.	The	code	checks	the	value	of	the	request.method	attribute	to	determine the	code	to	be	executed	based	on	the	HTTP	verb.  No	matter	what	the	HTTP	verb	is,	the	toy_detail	function	calls	the Toy.objects.get	method	with	the	received	pk	as	the	pk	argument	to	retrieve	a Toy	instance	from	the	database	based	on	the	specified	identifier,	and	saves it	in	the	toy	local	variable.	In	case	a	toy	with	the	specified	identifier	doesn't exist	in	the	database,	the	code	returns	an	HttpResponse	with	its	status	set	to status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,	that	is,	404	Not	Found.  If	the	HTTP	verb	is	GET,	the	code	creates	a	ToySerializer	instance	with	toy	as an	argument	and	returns	the	data	for	the	serialized	toy	in	a	JSONResponse	that   will	include	the	default	HTTP	200	OK	status.	The	code	returns	the	retrieved toy	serialized	as	JSON	in	the	response	body.  If	the	HTTP	verb	is	PUT,	the	code	has	to	create	a	new	toy	based	on	the JSON	data	that	is	included	in	the	HTTP	request	and	use	it	to	replace	an existing	toy.	First,	the	code	uses	a	JSONParser	instance	and	calls	its	parse method	with	request	as	an	argument	to	parse	the	toy	data	provided	as	JSON data	in	the	request	and	saves	the	results	in	the	toy_data	local	variable.	Then, the	code	creates	a	ToySerializer	instance	with	the	Toy	instance	previously retrieved	from	the	database	 toy 	and	the	retrieved	data	that	will	replace	the existing	data	 toy_data .	Then,	the	code	calls	the	is_valid	method	to determine	whether	the	Toy	instance	is	valid	or	not.	If	the	instance	is	valid, the	code	calls	the	save	method	to	persist	the	instance	with	the	replaced values	in	the	database	and	returns	a	JSONResponse	with	the	saved	data serialized	as	JSON	in	its	body	and	the	default	HTTP	200	OK	status.	If	the parsed	data	doesn't	generate	a	valid	Toy	instance,	the	code	returns	a JSONResponse	with	a	status	equal	to	status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,	that	is	400	Bad Request.  If	the	HTTP	verb	is	DELETE,	the	code	calls	the	delete	method	for	the	Toy instance	previously	retrieved	from	the	database	 toy .	The	call	to	the	delete method	erases	the	underlying	row	in	the	toys_toy	table	that	we	analyzed	in the	previous	chapter.	Thus,	the	toy	won't	be	available	anymore.	Then,	the code	returns	a	JSONResponse	with	a	status	equal	to	status.	HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT that	is,	204	No	Content.   Routing	URLs	to	Django	views and	functions  Now,	we	have	to	create	a	new	Python	file	named	urls.py	in	the	toys	folder, specifically,	the	toys urls.py	file.	The	following	lines	show	the	code	for	this file,	which	defines	the	URL	patterns	that	specify	the	regular	expressions that	have	to	be	matched	in	the	request	to	run	a	specific	function	previously defined	in	the	views.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_03_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 toys urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url	 from	toys	import	views	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	 				url r'^toys $',	views.toy_list ,	 				url r'^toys  ?P [0-9]+ $',	views.toy_detail ,	 ]	  The	urlpatterns	list	makes	it	possible	to	route	URLs	to	views.	The	code calls	the	django.conf.urls.url	function	with	the	regular	expression	that	has	to be	matched	and	the	view	function	defined	in	the	views	module	as	arguments to	create	a	RegexURLPattern	instance	for	each	entry	in	the	urlpatterns	list.  Now,	we	have	to	replace	the	code	in	the	urls.py	file	in	the	restful01	folder, specifically,	the	restful01 urls.py	file.	The	file	defines	the	root	URL configurations,	and	therefore	we	must	include	the	URL	patterns	declared in	the	previously	coded	toys urls.py	file.	The	following	lines	show	the	new code	for	the	restful01 urls.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included in	the	hillar_django_restful_03_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url,	include	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	   				url r'^',	include 'toys.urls'  ,	 ]	   Launching	Django's development	server  Now,	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	our	unsecured	web	service.	Remember	that	we	will	add security	later.  Execute	the	following	command	in	a	Linux	or	macOS	Terminal,	or	in	the Windows	Command	Prompt	or	Powershell	that	has	our	previously	created virtual	environment	activated.	Make	sure	you	are	in	the	restful01	folder within	the	virtual	environment's	main	folder:  				python	manage.py	runserver  The	following	lines	show	the	output	after	we	execute	the	previous command.	The	development	server	is	listening	at	port	8000:  				Performing	system	checks... 				 				System	check	identified	no	issues	 0	silenced . 				October	09,	2017	-	18:42:30 				Django	version	1.11.5,	using	settings	'restful01.settings' 				Starting	development	server	at	http:  127.0.0.1:8000  				Quit	the	server	with	CTRL-BREAK.  With	the	previous	command,	we	will	start	the	Django	development	server and	we	will	only	be	able	to	access	it	on	our	development	computer.	The previous	command	starts	the	development	server	at	the	default	IP	address, that	is,	127.0.0.1	 localhost .	It	is	not	possible	to	access	this	IP	address	from other	computers	or	devices	connected	to	our	LAN.	Thus,	if	we	want	to make	HTTP	requests	to	our	API	from	other	computers	or	devices   connected	to	our	LAN,	we	should	use	the	development	computer	IP address,	0.0.0.0	 for	IPv4	configurations 	or	::	 for	IPv6	configurations 	as the	desired	IP	address	for	our	development	server.  If	we	specify	0.0.0.0	as	the	desired	IP	address	for	IPv4	configurations,	the development	server	will	listen	on	every	interface	on	port	8000.	When	we specify	::	for	IPv6	configurations,	it	will	have	the	same	effect.	In	addition, it	is	necessary	to	open	the	default	port	8000	in	our	firewalls	 software and or	hardware 	and	configure	port-forwarding	to	the	computer	that	is running	the	development	server.	The	following	command	launches Django's	development	server	in	an	IPv4	configuration	and	allows	requests to	be	made	from	other	computers	and	devices	connected	to	our	LAN:  				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000	  If	you	decide	to	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	from	other	computers or	devices	connected	to	the	LAN,	remember	that	you	have	to	use	the development	computer's	assigned	IP	address	instead	of	localhost.	For example,	if	the	computer's	assigned	IPv4	IP	address	is	192.168.2.103,	instead of	localhost:8000,	you	should	use	192.168.2.103:8000.	Of	course,	you	can	also use	the	hostname	instead	of	the	IP	address.  The	previously	explained	configurations	are	very	important because	mobile	devices	might	be	the	consumers	of	our RESTful	Web	Services	and	we	will	always	want	to	test	the apps	that	make	use	of	our	web	services	and	APIs	in	our development	environments.   Making	HTTP	GET	requests that	target	a	collection	of instances  In	Chapter	1,	Installing	the	Required	Software	and	Tools,	we	installed command-line	and	GUI	tools	that	were	going	to	allow	us	to	compose	and send	HTTP	requests	to	the	web	services	we	were	going	to	build throughout	this	book.	Now,	we	will	use	the	curl	utility	to	make	HTTP GET	requests,	specifically,	HTTP	GET	requests	that	target	a	collection	of toys.	In	case	curl	is	not	included	in	the	path,	make	sure	you	replace	curl with	the	full	path	to	this	utility.  Make	sure	you	leave	the	Django	development	server	running.	Don't	close the	terminal	or	Command	Prompt	that	is	running	this	development	server. Open	a	new	Terminal	in	Linux	or	macOS,	or	a	Command	Prompt	in Windows,	and	run	the	following	command.	It	is	very	important	that	you enter	the	ending	slash	   	because	 toys	won't	match	any	of	the	patterns specified	in	urlpatterns	in	the	toys urls.py	file.	We	aren't	going	to	use options	to	follow	redirects.	Thus,	we	must	enter	 toys ,	including	the ending	slash	   .  				curl	-X	GET	localhost:8000 toys   The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	request	is	the	simplest	case	in our	RESTful	Web	Service	because	it	will	match	and	run	the	views.toy_list function,	that	is,	the	toy_list	function	we	coded	within	the	toys views.py	file. The	function	just	receives	request	as	a	parameter	because	the	URL	pattern doesn't	include	any	parameters.	As	the	HTTP	verb	for	the	request	is	GET, the	request.method	property	is	equal	to	'GET',	and	therefore,	the	function	will   				[{"pk":3,"name":"Clash	Royale	play	set","description":"6	figures	from	Clash	Royale","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:10:00.776594Z","toy_category":"Playset","was_included_in_home":false},{"pk":2,"name":"Hawaiian	Barbie","description":"Barbie	loves	Hawaii","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z","toy_category":"Dolls","was_included_in_home":true},{"pk":1,"name":"Snoopy	talking	action	figure","description":"Snoopy	speaks	five	languages","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z","toy_category":"Action	figures","was_included_in_home":false}]  execute	the	code	that	retrieves	all	the	Toy	objects	and	generates	a	JSON response	with	all	of	these	Toy	objects	serialized.  The	following	lines	show	an	example	response	for	the	HTTP	request,	with three	Toy	objects	in	the	JSON	response:  As	we	might	notice	from	the	previous	response,	the	curl	utility	displays the	JSON	response	in	a	single	line,	and	therefore,	it	is	a	bit	difficult	to read.	It	is	possible	to	use	different	tools,	including	some	Python	scripts,	to provide	a	better	format	to	the	response.	However,	we	will	use	the	HTTPie command-line	tool	we	installed	in	our	virtual	environment	for	this	purpose later.  In	this	case,	we	know	that	the	value	of	the	Content-Type	header	key	of	the response	is	application json.	However,	in	case	we	want	more	details	about the	response,	we	can	use	the	-i	option	to	request	curl	to	print	the	HTTP response	headers	and	their	key-value	pairs.	We	can	combine	the	-i	and	-X options	by	entering	-iX.  Go	back	to	the	terminal	in	Linux	or	macOS,	or	the	Command	prompt	in Windows,	and	run	the	following	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 toys   The	following	lines	show	an	example	response	for	the	HTTP	request.	The first	lines	show	the	HTTP	response	headers,	including	the	status	 200	OK  and	the	Content-Type:	application json.	After	the	HTTP	response	headers,	we can	see	the	details	for	the	three	Toy	objects	in	the	JSON	response:  				HTTP 1.0	200	OK 				Date:	Tue,	10	Oct	2017	00:53:41	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Content-Type:	application json   				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				Content-Length:	548 				 [{"pk":3,"name":"Clash	Royale	play	set","description":"6	figures	from	Clash	Royale","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:10:00.776594Z","toy_category":"Playset","was_included_in_home":false},{"pk":2,"name":"Hawaiian	Barbie","description":"Barbie	loves	Hawaii","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z","toy_category":"Dolls","was_included_in_home":true},{"pk":1,"name":"Snoopy	talking	action	figure","description":"Snoopy	speaks	five	languages","release_date":"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z","toy_category":"Action	figures","was_included_in_home":false}]  After	we	run	the	two	requests,	we	will	see	the	following	lines	in	the window	running	the	Django	development	server.	The	output	indicates	that the	server	received	two	HTTP	requests	with	the	GET	verb	and	 toys 	as	the URI.	The	server	processed	both	HTTP	requests,	returned	a	status	code equal	to	200,	and	the	response	length	was	equal	to	548	characters.  The	response	length	might	be	different	because	the	value	for	the	primary key	assigned	to	each	toy	will	have	an	incidence	in	the	response	length. The	first	number	after	HTTP 1.1."	indicates	the	returned	status	code	 200 	and the	second	number	the	response	length	 548 :  				[09 Oct 2017	22:12:37]	"GET	 toys 	HTTP 1.1"	200	548 				[09 Oct 2017	22:12:40]	"GET	 toys 	HTTP 1.1"	200	548  The	following	image	shows	two	Terminal	windows	side-by-side	on macOS.	The	Terminal	window	on	the	left-hand	side	is	running	the	Django development	server	and	displays	the	received	and	processed	HTTP requests.	The	Terminal	window	on	the	right-hand	side	is	running	curl commands	to	generate	the	HTTP	requests.	It	is	a	good	idea	to	use	a	similar configuration	to	check	the	output	while	we	compose	and	send	the	HTTP requests.	Notice	that	the	JSON	outputs	are	a	bit	difficult	to	read	because they	don't	use	syntax	highlighting:   Now,	open	a	new	Terminal	in	Linux	or	macOS,	or	a	new	Command Prompt	in	Windows,	and	activate	the	virtual	environment	we	created.	This way,	you	will	be	able	to	access	the	HTTPie	utility	we	installed	within	the virtual	environment.  We	will	use	the	http	command	to	easily	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests to	localhost:8000	and	test	the	RESTful	Web	Service.	HTTPie	supports	curl- like	shorthand	for	localhost,	and	therefore	we	can	use	:8000	as	a	shorthand that	expands	to	http:  localhost:8000.	Run	the	following	command	and remember	to	enter	the	ending	slash	   :  	http	:8000 toys   The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	request	is	the	same	one	we previously	composed	with	the	curl	command.	However,	in	this	case,	the HTTPie	utility	will	display	a	colorized	output	and	it	will	use	multiple	lines to	display	the	JSON	response,	without	any	additional	tweaks.	The previous	command	is	equivalent	to	the	following	command	that	specifies the	GET	method	after	http:   http	:8000 toys   The	following	lines	show	an	example	response	for	the	HTTP	request,	with the	headers	and	the	three	Toy	objects	in	the	JSON	response.	It	is	indeed easier	to	understand	the	response	compared	with	the	results	that	were generated	when	we	composed	the	HTTP	request	with	curl.	HTTPie automatically	formats	the	JSON	data	received	as	a	response	and	applies syntax	highlighting,	specifically,	both	colors	and	formatting:  				HTTP 1.0	200	OK 				Content-Length:	548 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Tue,	10	Oct	2017	01:26:52	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				[ 								{ 												"description":	"6	figures	from	Clash	Royale", 												"name":	"Clash	Royale	play	set", 												"pk":	3, 												"release_date":	"2017-10-09T12:10:00.776594Z", 												"toy_category":	"Playset", 												"was_included_in_home":	false 								}, 								{ 												"description":	"Barbie	loves	Hawaii", 												"name":	"Hawaiian	Barbie", 												"pk":	2, 												"release_date":	"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z", 												"toy_category":	"Dolls", 												"was_included_in_home":	true 								}, 								{ 												"description":	"Snoopy	speaks	five	languages", 												"name":	"Snoopy	talking	action	figure", 												"pk":	1, 												"release_date":	"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z", 												"toy_category":	"Action	figures", 												"was_included_in_home":	false 								} 				]	   We	can	achieve	the	same	results	by	combining	the	output generated	with	the	curl	command	with	other	utilities. However,	HTTPie	provides	us	exactly	what	we	need	for working	with	RESTful	Web	Services	such	as	the	one	we	are building	with	Django.	We	will	use	HTTPie	to	compose	and send	HTTP	requests,	but	we	will	always	provide	the equivalent	curl	command.	Remember	that	curl	is	faster	when you	need	to	execute	it	many	times,	such	as	when	you	prepare automated	scripts.  The	following	image	shows	two	Terminal	windows	side-by-side	on macOS.	The	Terminal	window	on	the	left-hand	side	is	running	the	Django development	server	and	displays	the	received	and	processed	HTTP requests.	The	Terminal	window	on	the	right-hand	side	is	running	HTTPie commands	to	generate	the	HTTP	requests.	Notice	that	the	JSON	output	is easier	to	read	compared	to	the	output	generated	by	the	curl	command:  We	can	execute	the	http	command	with	the	-b	option	in	case	we	don't	want to	include	the	header	in	the	response.	For	example,	the	following	line performs	the	same	HTTP	request	but	doesn't	display	the	header	in	the response	output,	and	therefore,	the	output	will	just	display	the	JSON response:  				http	-b	:8000 toys     Making	HTTP	GET	requests that	target	a	single	instance  Now,	we	will	make	HTTP	GET	requests	that	target	a	single	Toy	instance. We	will	select	one	of	the	toys	from	the	previous	list	and	we	will	compose an	HTTP	request	to	retrieve	only	the	chosen	toy.	For	example,	in	the previous	list,	the	first	toy	has	a	pk	value	equal	to	3	because	the	results	are ordered	by	the	toy's	name	in	ascending	order.	Run	the	following	command to	retrieve	this	toy.	Use	the	pk	value	you	have	retrieved	in	the	previous command	for	the	first	toy,	as	the	pk	number	might	be	different	if	you execute	the	sample	code	or	the	commands	more	than	once	or	you	make changes	to	the	toys_toy	table.	In	this	case,	you	don't	have	to	enter	an	ending slash	   	because	 toys 3 	won't	match	any	of	the	patterns	specified	in urlpatterns	in	the	toys urls.py	file:  				http	:8000 toys 3		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 toys 3  The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys 3 .	The	request	has	a	number	after  toys ,	and	therefore,	it	will	match	'^toys  ?P [0-9]+ $'	and	run	the views.toy_detail	function,	that	is,	the	toy_detail	function	declared	within	the toys views.py	file.	The	function	receives	request	and	pk	as	parameters	because the	URL	pattern	passes	the	number	specified	after	 toys 	in	the	pk parameter.  As	the	HTTP	verb	for	the	request	is	GET,	the	request.method	property	is	equal   to	'GET',	and	therefore,	the	toy_detail	function	will	execute	the	code	that retrieves	the	Toy	object	whose	primary	key	matches	the	pk	value	received	as an	argument	and,	if	found,	generates	a	JSON	response	with	this	Toy	object serialized.	The	following	lines	show	an	example	response	for	the	HTTP request,	with	the	Toy	object	that	matches	the	pk	value	in	the	JSON	response:  				HTTP 1.0	200	OK 				Content-Length:	182 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Tue,	10	Oct	2017	04:24:35	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"description":	"6	figures	from	Clash	Royale",	 								"name":	"Clash	Royale	play	set",	 								"pk":	3,	 								"release_date":	"2017-10-09T12:10:00.776594Z",	 								"toy_category":	"Playset",	 								"was_included_in_home":	false 				}  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	retrieve	a	toy	that doesn't	exist.	For	example,	in	the	previous	list,	there	is	no	toy	with	a	pk value	equal	to	17500.	Run	the	following	command	to	try	to	retrieve	this	toy. Make	sure	you	use	a	pk	value	that	doesn't	exist.	We	must	make	sure	that the	utilities	display	the	headers	as	part	of	the	response	because	the response	won't	have	a	body:  				http	:8000 toys 17500		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 toys 17500  The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys 17500.	The	request	is	the	same	as	the   previous	one	we	analyzed,	with	a	different	number	for	the	pk	parameter. The	server	will	run	the	views.toy_detail	function,	that	is,	the	toy_detail function	declared	within	the	toys views.py	file.	The	function	will	execute	the code	that	retrieves	the	Toy	object	whose	primary	key	matches	the	pk	value received	as	an	argument	and	a	Toy.DoesNotExist	exception	will	be	thrown	and captured	because	there	is	no	toy	with	the	specified	pk	value.	Thus,	the	code will	return	an	HTTP	404	Not	Found	status	code.

We	will	use	this GUI	tool	to	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	to	the	web	service.  The	first	time	you	execute	Postman,	you	will	see	a	modal	that	provides shortcuts	to	the	most	common	operations.	Make	sure	you	close	this	modal so	that	we	can	focus	on	the	main	UI	for	Postman.  We	will	use	the	Builder	tab	in	Postman	to	easily	compose	and	send	diverse HTTP	requests	to	localhost:8000	and	test	the	RESTful	Web	Service	with	this GUI	tool.	Postman	doesn't	support	curl-like	shorthand	for	localhost,	and therefore,	we	cannot	use	the	same	shorthand	we	have	been	using	when composing	requests	with	HTTPie.  Select	GET	in	the	drop-down	menu	on	the	left-hand	side	of	the	Enter request	URL	textbox,	and	enter	localhost:8000 toys 	in	this	textbox	on	the right-hand	side	of	the	drop-down	menu.	Then,	click	Send	and	Postman will	display	the	following	information:  Status:	200	OK.  Time:	The	time	it	took	for	the	request	to	be	processed.  Size:	The	approximate	response	size	 sum	of	body	size	plus headers	size .  Body:	The	response	body	with	all	the	toys	formatted	as	JSON with	syntax	highlighting.	The	default	view	for	the	body	is	Pretty   and	it	activates	syntax	highlighting.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	JSON	response	body	in	Postman	for the	HTTP	GET	request	to	localhost:8000 toys .  Click	on	the	Headers	tab	on	the	right-hand	side	of	the	Body	and	Cookies tab	to	read	the	response	headers.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the layout	for	the	response	headers	that	Postman	displays	for	the	previous response.	Notice	that	Postman	displays	the	Status	on	the	right-hand	side	of the	response	and	doesn't	include	it	as	the	first	line	of	the	key-value	pairs that	compose	the	headers,	as	when	we	worked	with	both	the	curl	and	http command-line	utilities.    Making	HTTP	POST	requests with	Postman  Now,	we	will	use	the	Builder	tab	in	Postman	to	compose	and	send	an HTTP	POST	request	to	create	a	new	toy.	Perform	the	following	steps:  1.	 Click	on	the	plus	 + 	button	on	the	right-hand	side	of	the	tab	that displayed	the	previous	request.	This	way,	you	will	create	a	new tab.  2.	 Select	Request	in	the	New	drop-down	menu	located	in	the	upper-  3.	 Select	POST	in	the	drop-down	menu	on	the	left-hand	side	of	the  4.	 Enter	localhost:8000 toys 	in	that	textbox	on	the	right-hand	side	of  left	corner.  Enter	request	URL	textbox.  the	drop-down	menu.  5.	 Click	Body	on	the	right-hand	side	of	Authorization	and	Headers,  within	the	panel	that	composes	the	request.  6.	 Activate	the	raw	radio	button	and	select	JSON	 application json  in	the	drop-down	menu	on	the	right-hand	side	of	the	binary	radio button.	Postman	will	automatically	add	a	Content-type	= application json	header,	and	therefore,	you	will	notice	the	Headers tab	will	be	renamed	to	Headers	 1 ,	indicating	to	us	that	there	is one	key-value	pair	specified	for	the	request	headers.  7.	 Enter	the	following	lines	in	the	textbox	below	the	radio	buttons,  within	the	Body	tab:   {	 				"name":	"Wonderboy	puzzle",		 				"description":"The	Dragon's	Trap	puzzle",	 				"toy_category":"Puzzles	&	Games",	 				"was_included_in_home":	"false",	 				"release_date":	"2017-10-03T01:01:00.776594Z"	 }	  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	request	body	in	Postman:  We	followed	the	necessary	steps	to	create	an	HTTP	POST	request	with	a JSON	body	that	specifies	the	necessary	key-value	pairs	to	create	a	new toy.	Click	Send	and	Postman	will	display	the	following	information:  Status:	201	Created  Time:	The	time	it	took	for	the	request	to	be	processed  Size:	The	approximate	response	size	 sum	of	body	size	plus headers	size   Body:	The	response	body	with	the	recently	added	toy	formatted	as   JSON	with	syntax	highlighting  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	JSON	response	body	in	Postman	for the	HTTP	POST	request:  If	we	want	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	PUT	request	with Postman,	it	is	necessary	to	follow	the	previously	explained steps	to	provide	JSON	data	within	the	request	body.  One	of	the	nice	features	included	in	Postman	is	that	we	can	easily	review and	run	the	HTTP	requests	we	have	made	again	by	browsing	the	saved History	shown	on	the	left-hand	side	of	the	Postman	window.	The	History panel	displays	a	list	with	the	HTTP	verb	followed	by	the	URL	for	each HTTP	request	we	have	composed	and	sent.	We	just	need	to	click	on	the desired	HTTP	request	and	click	Send	to	run	it	again.	The	following screenshot	shows	the	many	HTTP	requests	in	the	History	panel	and	the first	HTTP	GET	request	that	was	executed	selected	so	it	can	be	easily resent:   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly:  1.	 The	urlpatterns	list	declared	in	the	urls.py	file	makes	it	possible	to:  1.	 Route	URLs	to	Django	models 2.	 Route	URLs	to	Django	views 3.	 Route	URLs	to	Python	primitives  2.	 When	the	Django	server	receives	an	HTTP	request,	Django  creates	an	instance	of	which	of	the	following	classes?  1.	 django.restframework.HttpRequest 2.	 django.http.HttpRequest 3.	 django.http.Request  3.	 A	view	function	has	to	return	an	instance	of	which	of	the  following	classes?  1.	 django.http.HttpResponse 2.	 django.http.Response 3.	 django.restfremework.HttpResponse  4.	 Whenever	you	have	to	return	a	specific	status	different	from	the  default	200	OK	status,	it	is	a	good	practice	to	use	the	module   variables	defined	in	which	of	the	following	modules?  1.	 rest_framework.HttpStatus 2.	 django.status 3.	 rest_framework.status  5.	 If	you	want	to	retrieve	a	Toy	instance	whose	primary	key	value	is  equal	to	10	and	save	it	in	the	toy	variable,	which	line	of	code would	you	write?  1.	 toy	=	Toy.get_by pk=10  2.	 toy	=	Toy.objects.all pk=10  3.	 toy	=	Toy.objects.get pk=pk   	  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	executed	our	first	version	of	a	simple	Django	RESTful Web	Service	that	interacts	with	an	SQLite	database.	We	wrote	API	views to	process	diverse	HTTP	requests	on	a	collection	of	toys	and	on	a	specific toy.	We	worked	with	the	following	HTTP	verbs:	GET,	POST,	and	PUT. We	configured	the	URL	patterns	list	to	route	URLs	to	views.  Then,	we	started	the	Django	development	server	and	we	used	command- line	tools	 curl	and	HTTPie 	to	compose	and	send	diverse	HTTP	requests to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	learned	how	HTTP	requests	were processed	in	Django	and	our	code.	Finally,	we	worked	with	Postman,	a GUI	tool,	to	compose	and	send	other	HTTP	requests	to	our	RESTful	Web Service.  Now	that	we	understand	the	basics	of	a	RESTful	Web	Service	with Django	REST	framework	and	a	simple	SQLite	database,	we	will	work with	a	seriously	powerful	PostgreSQL	database,	use	class-based	views instead	of	function	views,	and	we	will	take	advantage	of	advanced	features included	in	Django	REST	framework	to	work	with	different	content	types, without	writing	a	huge	amount	of	code.	We	will	cover	these	topics	in	the next	chapter.   Using	Generalized	Behavior from	the	APIView	Class  In	this	chapter,	we	will	improve	our	simple	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will make	it	possible	for	it	to	work	with	diverse	content	types	without	writing	a huge	amount	of	code.	We	will	take	advantage	of	advanced	features	and generalized	behaviors	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	to	enable multiple	parsers	and	renderers.	We	will	gain	an	understanding	of:  Taking	advantage	of	model	serializers  Understanding	accepted	and	returned	content	types  Making	unsupported	HTTP	OPTIONS	requests	with	command- line	tools  Understanding	decorators	that	work	as	wrappers  Using	decorators	to	enable	different	parsers	and	renderers  Taking	advantage	of	content	negotiation	classes  Making	supported	HTTP	OPTIONS	requests	with	command-line tools  Working	with	different	content	types  Sending	HTTP	requests	with	unsupported	HTTP	verbs   Taking	advantage	of	model serializers  In	Chapter	1,	Installing	the	Required	Software	and	Tools,	we	created	the	toy model	 the	Toy	class 	and	its	serializer	 the	ToySerializer	class .	When	we wrote	the	code	for	the	ToySerializer	class,	we	had	to	declare	many	attributes with	the	same	names	that	we	used	in	the	Toy	class.	The	ToySerializer	class	is a	subclass	of	the	rest_framework.serializers.Serializer	superclass;	it	declares attributes	that	we	manually	mapped	to	the	appropriate	types,	and	overrides the	create	and	update	methods.	However,	we	repeated	a	lot	of	code	and information	that	was	already	included	in	the	toy	model,	such	as	the	types and	the	max_length	values	that	specify	the	maximum	length	for	each	string field.  Now,	we	will	take	advantage	of	model	serializers	to	simplify	code	and	to avoid	repeating	information	that	is	already	included	in	the	model.	We	will create	a	new	version	of	the	existing	ToySerializer	class	that	will	inherit	from the	rest_framework.serializers.ModelSerializer	superclass	instead	of	inheriting from	the	rest_framework.serializers.ModelSerializer	superclass.  The	ModelSerializer	class	automatically	populates	a	set	of	default	fields	and default	validators	by	retrieving	metadata	from	the	related	model	class	that we	must	specify.	In	addition,	the	ModelSerializer	class	provides	default implementations	for	the	create	and	update	methods.	In	this	case,	we	will take	advantage	of	these	default	implementations	because	they	will	be suitable	to	provide	our	necessary	create	and	update	methods.  Go	to	the	restful01 toys	folder	and	open	the	serializers.py	file.	The	code	file for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_04_01	folder,	in	the restful01 toys serializers.py	file.	Replace	the	code	in	this	file	with	the following	code	that	declares	the	new	version	of	the	ToySerializer	class:   from	rest_framework	import	serializers	 from	toys.models	import	Toy	 	 	 class	ToySerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Toy	 								fields	=	 'id',		 																		'name',		 																		'description',	 																		'release_date',	 																		'toy_category',		 																		'was_included_in_home'   The	new	version	of	the	ToySerializer	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that declares	the	following	two	attributes:  model:	This	attribute	specifies	the	model	related	to	the	serializer, that	is,	the	Toy	class  fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	string	whose	values indicate	the	field	names	that	we	want	to	include	in	the	serialization from	the	related	model	 the	Toy	class   The	new	version	of	the	ToySerializer	class	doesn't	need	to	override	either the	create	or	update	methods	because	the	generic	behavior	provided	by	the ModelSerializer	class	will	be	enough	in	this	case.	The	ModelSerializer superclass	provides	implementations	for	both	methods.  With	the	changes	we	have	made,	we	removed	a	nice	amount	of	code	from the	ToySerializer	class.	In	the	new	version,	we	just	had	to	specify	the	related model	and	the	desired	set	of	fields	in	a	tuple.	Now,	the	types	and	max_length values	related	to	the	toy	fields	are	only	included	in	the	Toy	class.  If	you	have	previous	experience	with	the	Django	Web framework,	you	will	realize	that	the	Serializer	and ModelSerializer	classes	in	the	Django	REST	framework	are similar	to	the	Form	and	ModelForm	classes	in	Django.   You	can	press	Ctrl	+	C	to	quit	Django's	development	server	and	execute the	command	that	we	learned	in	Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	to	run	the server	to	start	it	again.	In	this	case,	we	just	edited	one	file,	and	in	case	you didn't	stop	the	development	server,	Django	will	detect	the	changes	when we	save	the	changes	to	the	file	and	it	will	automatically	restart	the	server.  The	following	lines	show	sample	output	that	you	will	see	after	you	save the	changes	in	the	edited	Python	file.	The	lines	indicate	that	Django	has restarted	the	development	server	and	successfully	performed	a	system check	that	identified	no	issues:  				System	check	identified	no	issues	 0	silenced . 				October	13,	2017	-	04:11:13 				Django	version	1.11.5,	using	settings	'restful01.settings' 				Starting	development	server	at	http:  0.0.0.0:8000  				Quit	the	server	with	CONTROL-C.	  You	can	use	the	command-line	and	GUI	tools	we	used	in	Chapter	3, Creating	API	Views,	to	test	the	new	version	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service that	takes	advantage	of	model	serializers.	The	behavior	will	be	the	same	as in	the	previous	version.	However,	we	definitely	have	less	code	to	maintain and	we	have	removed	duplicated	data.   Understanding	accepted	and returned	content	types  So	far,	our	RESTful	Web	Service	has	been	working	with	JSON	for	the response	body.	The	code	we	wrote	in	the	toys views.py	file	in	Chapter 3,	Creating	API	Views,	declares	a	JSONResponse	class	and	two	function-based views.	These	functions	return	a	JSONResponse	when	it	is	necessary	to	return JSON	data	and	a	django.Http.Response.HttpResponse	instance	when	the	response is	just	an	HTTP	status	code.	No	matter	the	accepted	content	type	specified in	the	HTTP	request	header,	the	view	functions	always	provide	the	same content	in	the	response	body:	JSON.  Run	the	following	command	to	retrieve	all	the	toys	with	the	Accept	request header	key	set	to	text html.	Remember	that	the	virtual	environment	we have	created	in	Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	must	be	activated	in	order	to run	the	next	http	command:  				http	:8000 toys 	Accept:text html	  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-H	"Accept:	text html"	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 toys   The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	These	commands	specify	the text html	value	for	the	Accept	key	in	the	request	header.	This	way,	the	HTTP request	indicates	that	it	accepts	a	response	of	text html.  The	header	response	for	the	request	will	include	the	following	line:   				Content-Type:	application json	  Now,	run	the	following	command	to	retrieve	all	the	toys	with	different values	with	the	Accept	request	header	key	set	to	text html.  Run	the	following	command	to	retrieve	all	the	toys	with	the	Accept	request header	key	set	to	application json:  			http	:8000 toys 	Accept:application json  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  		curl	-H	"Accept:	application json"	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 toys   The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	These	commands	specify	the application json	value	for	the	Accept	key	in	the	request	header.	This	way,	the HTTP	request	indicates	that	it	accepts	a	response	of	application json.  The	header	response	for	the	request	will	include	the	following	line:  				Content-Type:	application json  The	first	group	of	commands	defined	the	text html	value	for	the	Accept request	header	key.	The	second	group	of	commands	defined	the application json	value	for	the	Accept	request	header	key.	However,	both produced	the	same	results	and	the	responses	were	always	in	the	JSON format.	The	view	functions	don't	take	into	account	the	value	specified	for the	Accept	request	header	key	in	the	HTTP	requests.	No	matter	the	value indicated	for	the	Accept	request	header	key,	the	response	is	always	in	the JSON	format.   We	want	to	provide	support	for	other	formats.	However,	we	don't	want	to write	a	huge	amount	of	code	to	do	so.	Thus,	we	will	take	advantage	of additional	features	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	that	will make	it	easy	for	us	to	support	additional	formats	for	our	RESTful	Web Service.   Making	unsupported	HTTP OPTIONS	requests	with command-line	tools  Sometimes,	we	don't	know	which	are	the	HTTP	methods	or	verbs	that	a resource	or	resource	collection	supports	in	a	RESTful	Web	Service.	In order	to	provide	a	solution	to	this	problem,	we	can	compose	and	send	an HTTP	request	with	the	OPTIONS	HTTP	verb	and	the	URL	for	the	resource	or the	resource	collection.  If	the	RESTful	Web	Service	implements	the	OPTIONS	HTTP	verb	for	a resource	or	resource	collection,	it	will	build	a	response	with	an	Allow	key	in the	response	header.	The	value	for	this	key	will	include	a	comma- separated	list	of	HTTP	verbs	or	methods	that	it	supports.	In	addition,	the response	header	will	include	additional	information	about	other	supported options,	such	as	the	content	type	it	is	capable	of	parsing	from	the	request and	the	content	type	it	is	capable	of	rendering	in	the	response.  For	example,	if	we	want	to	know	which	HTTP	verbs	the	toys	collection supports,	we	can	run	the	following	command:  				http	OPTIONS	:8000 toys   Notice	that	the	command	will	generate	an	error	in	the	Django development	server.  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	OPTIONS	localhost:8000 toys    The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	OPTIONS	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	request	specifies	 toys ,	and therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^toys $'	regular	expression	and	run	the views.toy_list	function,	that	is,	the	toy_list	function	declared	within	the toys views.py	file.	This	function	only	runs	code	when	the	request.method	is equal	to	either	'GET'	or	'POST'.	In	this	case,	request.method	is	equal	to	'OPTIONS', and	therefore,	the	function	won't	run	any	code.	The	function	won't	return the	expected	HttpResponse	instance.  The	lack	of	the	expected	HttpResponse	instance	generates	an	internal	server error	in	Django's	development	server.	The	console	output	for	the development	server	will	display	details	about	the	internal	server	error	and a	traceback	similar	to	the	one	shown	in	the	next	screenshot.	The	last	lines indicate	that	there	is	a	ValueError	because	the	toys_list	function	didn't	return an	HttpResponse	instance	and	returned	None	instead:  The	following	lines	show	the	header	for	the	output	displayed	as	a	result	of the	HTTP	request.	The	response	also	includes	a	detailed	HTML	document with	a	huge	amount	of	information	about	the	error	because	the	debug mode	is	activated	for	Django.	We	receive	an	HTTP	500	Internal	Server	Error status	code.	Obviously,	we	don't	want	all	this	information	to	be	provided in	a	production-ready	web	service,	in	which	we	will	deactivate	the	debug mode:   				HTTP 1.0	500	Internal	Server	Error 				Content-Length:	52222 				Content-Type:	text html 				Date:	Tue,	10	Oct	2017	17:46:34	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN  We	don't	want	our	web	service	to	provide	a	response	with	an	HTTP	500 Internal	Server	Error	status	code	when	we	receive	a	request	with	the	OPTIONS verb	to	either	a	valid	resource	or	resource	collection.	Obviously,	we	want to	provide	a	more	consistent	web	service	and	we	want	to	provide	an accurate	response	when	we	receive	a	request	with	the	OPTIONS	verbs,	for either	a	toy	resource	or	the	toys	collection.  If	we	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	with	the	OPTIONS	verb	for	an existing	toy	resource,	we	will	see	the	same	error	in	the	console	output	for the	development	server	and	a	similar	response	with	the	HTTP	500	Internal Server	Error	status	code.	The	views.toy_detail	function	only	runs	code	when the	request.method	is	equal	to	'GET',	'PUT',	or	'DELETE'.	Thus,	as	happened	with the	previous	case,	the	toys_detail	function	won't	return	an	HttpResponse instance	and	it	will	return	None	instead.  The	following	commands	will	produce	the	explained	error	when	we	try	to see	the	options	offered	for	the	toy	resource	whose	id	or	primary	key	is equal	to	2.	Make	sure	you	replace	2	with	a	primary	key	value	of	an	existing toy	in	your	configuration:  				http	OPTIONS	:8000 toys 2  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	OPTIONS	localhost:8000 toys 2  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	details	of	the	internal	server	error	and   a	traceback	displayed	in	the	console	output	for	the	development	server after	we	run	the	previous	HTTP	request:   Understanding	decorators	that work	as	wrappers  Now,	we	will	make	a	few	changes	to	the	code	in	the	toys views.py	file	to provide	support	for	the	OPTIONS	verb	in	our	RESTful	Web	Service. Specifically,	we	will	take	advantage	of	a	decorator	provided	by	the	Django REST	framework.  We	will	use	the	@api_view	decorator	that	is	declared	in	the rest_framework.decorators	module.	We	will	apply	this	decorator	to	our function-based	views:	toys_list	and	toys_detail.  The	@api_view	decorator	allows	us	to	specify	which	are	the	HTTP	verbs	that the	function	to	which	it	is	applied	can	process.	If	the	request	that	has	been routed	to	the	view	function	has	an	HTTP	verb	that	isn't	included	in	the string	list	specified	as	the	http_method_names	argument	for	the	@api_view decorator,	the	default	behavior	returns	a	response	with	an	HTTP	405	Method Not	Allowed	status	code.  This	way,	we	make	sure	that	whenever	the	RESTful	Web	Service	receives an	HTTP	verb	that	isn't	considered	within	our	function	views,	we	won't generate	an	unexpected	and	undesired	error	in	Django.	The	decorator generates	the	appropriate	response	for	the	unsupported	HTTP	verbs	or methods.	In	addition,	by	reading	the	declaration	of	our	function	views,	we can	easily	understand	which	HTTP	verbs	are	handled	by	the	function.  It	is	very	important	to	understand	what	happens	under	the	hood	whenever we	use	the	@api_view	decorator.	This	decorator	is	a	wrapper	that	converts	a function-based	view	into	a	subclass	of	the	rest_framework.views.APIView	class. This	class	is	the	base	class	for	all	the	views	in	the	Django	REST framework.   We	will	work	with	class-based	views	in	the	forthcoming examples	and	we	will	have	the	same	benefits	we	have analyzed	for	the	function-based	views	that	use	the	decorator.  In	addition,	the	decorator	uses	the	string	list	we	specify	with	the	supported HTTP	verbs	to	build	the	response	for	a	request	with	the	OPTIONS	HTTP	verb. The	automatically	generated	response	includes	the	supported	method,	and the	parser	and	the	render	capabilities.	In	other	words,	the	response includes	the	format	that	the	function	is	capable	of	understanding	and	the format	that	the	function	can	generate	for	the	response.  As	previously	explained,	the	current	version	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service is	only	capable	of	rendering	JSON	as	its	output.	The	usage	of	the decorator	makes	sure	that	we	always	receive	an	instance	of	the rest_framework.request.Request	class	in	the	request	argument	when	Django	calls our	view	function.	In	addition,	the	decorator	handles	the	ParserError exceptions	when	our	function	views	access	the	request.data	attribute	and there	are	parsing	problems.   Using	decorators	to	enable different	parsers	and	renderers  We	will	make	changes	to	just	one	file.	After	you	save	the	changes, Django's	development	server	will	automatically	restart.	However,	you	can decide	to	stop	Django's	development	server	and	start	it	again	after	you finish	all	the	necessary	changes.  We	will	make	the	necessary	changes	to	use	the	previously	introduced @api_view	decorator	to	make	it	possible	for	the	RESTful	Web	Service	to work	with	different	parsers	and	renderers,	by	taking	advantage	of generalized	behaviors	provided	by	the	APIView	class.  Now,	go	to	the	restful01 toys	folder	and	open	the	views.py	file.	Replace	the code	in	this	file	with	the	following	lines.	However,	take	into	account	that many	lines	have	been	removed,	such	as	the	lines	that	declared	the JSONResponse	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_04_02	folder,	in	the	restful01 toys views.py	file:  from	django.shortcuts	import	render	 from	rest_framework	import	status	 from	toys.models	import	Toy	 from	toys.serializers	import	ToySerializer from	rest_framework.decorators	import	api_view	 from	rest_framework.response	import	Response	 	 	 @api_view ['GET',	'POST'] 	 def	toy_list request :	 				if	request.method	==	'GET':	 								toys	=	Toy.objects.all  	 								toys_serializer	=	ToySerializer toys,	many=True 	 								return	Response toys_serializer.data 	 	 				elif	request.method	==	'POST':	 								toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer data=request.data 	   								if	toy_serializer.is_valid  :	 												toy_serializer.save  	 												return	Response toy_serializer.data,	status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED 	 								return	Response toy_serializer.errors,	status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST 	 	 	 @api_view ['GET',	'PUT',	'DELETE'] 	 def	toy_detail request,	pk :	 				try:	 								toy	=	Toy.objects.get pk=pk 	 				except	Toy.DoesNotExist:	 								return	Response status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND 	 	 				if	request.method	==	'GET':	 								toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer toy 	 								return	Response toy_serializer.data 	 	 				elif	request.method	==	'PUT':	 								toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer toy,	data=request.data 	 								if	toy_serializer.is_valid  :	 												toy_serializer.save  	 												return	Response toy_serializer.data 	 								return	Response toy_serializer.errors,	status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST 	 	 				elif	request.method	==	'DELETE':	 								toy.delete  	 								return	Response status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT 	  The	new	code	applies	the	@api_view	decorator	for	the	two	functions:	toy_list and	toy_detail.	In	addition,	the	new	code	removes	the	JSONResponse	class	and uses	the	more	generic	rest_framework.response.Response	class.  We	had	to	remove	the	usage	of	the	rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser	class	in the	functions	to	make	it	possible	to	work	with	different	parsers.	This	way, we	stopped	working	with	a	parser	that	only	works	with	JSON.	In	the	older version	of	the	code,	the	toy_list	function	executed	the	following	two	lines when	the	request.method	attribute	was	equal	to	'POST':  toy_data	=	JSONParser  .parse request 	 toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer data=toy_data 	  In	the	new	code,	we	removed	the	first	line	that	called	the	JSONParser  .parse   method	that	was	only	capable	of	parsing	JSON	content.	The	new	code replaces	the	two	previous	lines	with	the	following	single	line	that	passes request.data	as	the	data	argument	to	create	a	new	ToySerializer	instance:  toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer data=request.data 	  In	the	older	version	of	the	code,	the	toy_detail	function	executed	the following	two	lines	when	the	request.method	attribute	was	equal	to	'PUT':  toy_data	=	JSONParser  .parse request 	 toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer toy,	data=toy_data   We	made	edits	that	are	similar	to	the	changes	done	for	the	code	in	the toy_list	function.	We	removed	the	first	line	that	called	the	JSONParser  .parse method	that	was	only	capable	of	parsing	JSON	content.	The	new	code replaces	the	two	previous	lines	with	the	following	single	line	that	passes toy	as	the	first	argument	and	request.data	as	the	data	argument	to	create	a new	ToySerializer	instance:  toy_serializer	=	ToySerializer toy,	data=request.data 	   Taking	advantage	of	content negotiation	classes  The	APIView	class	defines	default	settings	for	each	view	that	we	can override	by	specifying	the	desired	values	in	the	settings	module,	that	is, the	restful01 settings.py	file.	It	is	also	possible	to	override	the	class attributes	in	subclasses.	In	this	case,	we	won't	make	changes	in	the	settings module,	but	we	have	to	understand	which	are	the	default	settings	that	the APIView	class	uses.	We	added	the		@api_view	decorator,	and	it	automatically makes	the	APIView	use	these	settings.  The	value	for	the	DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES	setting	key	specifies	a	tuple	of	string whose	values	indicate	the	default	classes	that	we	want	to	use	for	parsing backends.	The	following	lines	show	the	default	values:   	 				'rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser',	 				'rest_framework.parsers.FormParser',	 				'rest_framework.parsers.MultiPartParser'	  	  When	we	use	the	@api_view	decorator,	the	RESTful	Web	Service	will	be able	to	handle	any	of	the	following	content	types	through	the	appropriate parsers.	Thus,	we	will	be	able	to	work	with	the	request.data	attribute	to retrieve	the	keys	and	values	for	each	of	these	content	types:  application json:	Parsed	by	the	rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser	class  application x-www-form-urlencoded:	Parsed	by	the rest_framework.parsers.FormParser	class  multipart form-data:	Parsed	by	the	rest_framework.parsers.MultiPartParser   class  When	we	access	the	request.data	attribute	in	the	functions,	the	Django REST	framework	examines	the	value	for	the	Content-Type	header	in	the incoming	request	and	determines	the	appropriate	parser	to	parse	the request	content.	If	we	use	the	previously	explained	default	values,	the Django	REST	Framework	will	be	able	to	parse	all	of	the	previously	listed content	types.	Notice	that	the	request	must	specify	the	appropriate	value for	the	Content-Type	key	in	the	request	header.  The	value	for	the	DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES	setting	key	specifies	a	tuple	of string	whose	values	indicate	the	default	classes	that	we	want	to	use	for rendering	backends.	The	following	lines	show	the	default	values:   	 				'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',	 				'rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer',	  	  When	we	use	the	@api_view	decorator,	the	RESTful	Web	Service	will	be able	to	render	any	of	the	following	content	types	through	the	appropriate renderers.	We	made	the	necessary	changes	to	work	with	a rest_framework.response.Response	instance	to	be	able	to	work	with	these content	types:  application json:	Rendered	by	the	rest_framework.response.JSONRenderer class  text html:	Rendered	by	the	rest_framework.response.BrowsableAPIRenderer class  So	far,	we	understand	the	default	settings	for	parsers	and	renderers.	There is	an	additional	part	of	this	puzzle	that	must	select	the	appropriate	renderer for	the	response	based	on	the	requirements	specified	in	the	incoming   request.  By	default,	the	value	for	the	DEFAULT_CONTENT_NEGOTIATION_CLASS	is	the rest_framework.negotiation.DefaultContentNegotiation	class.	When	we	use	the decorator,	the	web	service	will	use	this	content	negotiation	class	to	select the	appropriate	renderer	for	the	response,	based	on	the	incoming	request. This	way,	when	a	request	specifies	that	it	will	accept	text html,	the	content negotiation	class	selects	the	rest_framework.renderers.BrowsableAPIRenderer	to render	the	response	and	generate	text html	instead	of	application json.  In	the	old	version	of	the	code,	we	used	the	JSONResponse	and	HttpResponse classes	in	the	functions.	The	new	version	replaced	the	usages	of	both classes	with	the	rest_framework.response.Response	class.	This	way,	the	code takes	advantage	of	the	content	negotiation	features.	The	Response	class renders	the	provided	data	into	the	appropriate	content	type	and	returns	it	to the	client	that	made	the	request.   Making	supported	HTTP OPTIONS	requests	with command-line	tools  Now,	we	will	take	advantage	of	all	the	changes	we've	made	in	the	code and	we	will	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	to	make	our	RESTful	Web Service	work	with	different	content	types.	Make	sure	you've	saved	all	the changes.	In	case	you	stopped	Django's	development	server,	you	will	have to	start	it	again	as	we	learned	in	Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	in	the section	Launching	Django's	development	server,	to	start	running	the Django	development	server.  We	want	to	know	which	HTTP	verbs	the	toys,	collection	supports,	that	is, we	want	to	take	advantage	of	the	OPTIONS	verb.	Run	the	following command.	This	time,	the	command	won't	produce	errors.	Remember	that the	virtual	environment	we	have	created	in	the	previous	chapters	must	be activated	in	order	to	run	the	next	http	command:  				http	OPTIONS	:8000 toys   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	OPTIONS	localhost:8000 toys   The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	OPTIONS	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	request	will	end	up	running the	views.toy_list	function,	that	is,	the	toy_list	function	declared	within	the toys views.py	file.	We	added	the	@api_view	decorator	to	this	function,	and therefore,	the	function	is	capable	of	determining	the	supported	HTTP   verbs,	the	enabled	parsing	and	rendering	options.	The	following	lines show	the	output:  				HTTP 1.0	200	OK 				Allow:	POST,	OPTIONS,	GET 				Content-Length:	167 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Mon,	16	Oct	2017	04:28:32	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"description":	"",	 								"name":	"Toy	List",	 								"parses":	[ 												"application json",	 												"application x-www-form-urlencoded",	 												"multipart form-data" 								],	 								"renders":	[ 												"application json",	 												"text html" 								] 				} 	  The	response	header	includes	an	Allow	key	with	a	comma-separated	list	of HTTP	verbs	supported	by	the	resource	collection	as	its	value:	POST,	OPTIONS, GET.	Our	request	didn't	specify	the	allowed	content	type,	and	therefore,	the function	rendered	the	response	with	the	default	application json	content type.  The	response	body	specifies	the	Content-type	that	the	resource	collection	is capable	of	parsing	in	the	values	for	the	"parses"	key	and	the	Content-type	that the	resource	collection	is	capable	of	rendering	in	the	values	for	the "renders"	key.  Run	the	following	command	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	with the	OPTIONS	verb	for	a	toy	resource.	Don't	forget	to	replace	2	with	a	primary key	value	of	an	existing	toy	in	your	configuration:   				http	OPTIONS	:8000 toys 2  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	OPTIONS	localhost:8000 toys 2  The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	OPTIONS	http:  localhost:8000 toys 2.	The	request	will	end	up	running the	views.toy_detail	function,	that	is,	the	toy_detail	function	declared	within the	toys views.py	file.	We	also	added	the	@api_view	decorator	to	this	function, and	therefore,	it	is	capable	of	determining	the	supported	HTTP	verbs,	the enabled	parsing	and	rendering	options.	The	following	lines	show	a	sample output:  				HTTP 1.0	200	OK 				Allow:	DELETE,	PUT,	OPTIONS,	GET 				Content-Length:	169 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Mon,	16	Oct	2017	04:30:04	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"description":	"",	 								"name":	"Toy	Detail",	 								"parses":	[ 												"application json",	 												"application x-www-form-urlencoded",	 												"multipart form-data" 								],	 								"renders":	[ 												"application json",	 												"text html" 								] 				} 		  The	response	header	includes	an	Allow	key	with	a	comma-separated	list	of   HTTP	verbs	supported	by	the	resource	as	its	value:	DELETE,	PUT,	OPTIONS,	GET. The	response	body	specifies	the	Content-type	that	the	resource	is	capable	of parsing	in	the	values	for	the	"parses"	key	and	the	Content-type	that	the resource	collection	is	capable	of	rendering	in	the	values	for	the	"renders" key.	The	resource	and	the	resource	collection	can	parse	and	render	the same	content	types	because	everything	is	handled	by	the	decorator	and	the APIView	class.   Working	with	different	content types  In	Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	when	we	composed	and	sent	POST	and	PUT commands,	we	had	to	use	the	use	the	-H	"Content-Type:	application json" option	to	indicate	curl	to	send	the	data	specified	after	the	-d	option	as application json.	We	had	to	use	this	option	because	the	default	content-type in	curl	is	application x-www-form-urlencoded.  Now,	our	RESTful	Web	Service	goes	beyond	JSON	and	it	can	also	parse application x-www-form-urlencoded	and	multipart form-data	data	specified	in	the POST	and	PUT	requests.	Hence,	we	can	compose	and	send	a	POST	command that	sends	the	data	as	application x-www-form-urlencoded.  We	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	create	a	new	toy.	In	this case,	we	will	use	the	-f	option	for	HTTP.  This	option	serializes	data	items	from	the	command	line	as	form	fields	and sets	the	Content-Type	header	key	to	the	application x-www-form-urlencoded	value. Run	the	next	command:  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	creates	a	new	toy. Notice	that	we	don't	use	the	-H	option	and	curl	will	send	the	data	in	the default	application x-www-form-urlencoded:  The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP  http	-f	POST	:8000 toys 	name="Ken	in	Rome"	description="Ken	loves	Rome"	toy_category="Dolls"	was_included_in_home=false	release_date="2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z"		  curl	-iX	POST	-d	'{"name":"Ken	in	Rome",	"description":	"Ken	loves	Rome",	"toy_category":"Dolls",	"was_included_in_home":	"false",	"release_date":	"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z"}'	localhost:8000 toys    request:	POST	http:  localhost:8000 toys 	with	the	Content-Type	header	key	set	to the	application x-www-form-urlencoded	value	and	the	following	data:  name=Ken+in+Rome&description=Ken+loves+Rome&toy_category=Dolls&was_included_in_home=false&release_date=2017-10-09T12%3A11%3A37.090335Z	  The	request	specifies	 toys ,	and	therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^toys $' regular	expression	and	Django	will	run	the	views.toy_list	function,	that	is, the	updated	toy_detail	function	declared	within	the	toys views.py	file.	The HTTP	verb	for	the	request	is	POST,	and	therefore,	the	request.method	property is	equal	to	'POST'.	The	function	will	execute	the	code	that	creates	a ToySerializer	instance	and	passes	request.data	as	the	data	argument	to	create the	new	instance.  The	rest_framework.parsers.FormParser	class	will	parse	the	data	received	in	the request,	the	code	creates	a	new	Toy	and,	if	the	data	is	valid,	it	saves	the	new Toy.	If	the	new	Toy	instance	was	successfully	persisted	in	the	database,	the function	returns	an	HTTP	201	Created	status	code	and	the	recently	persisted Toy	serialized	to	JSON	in	the	response	body.	The	following	lines	show	an example	response	for	the	HTTP	request,	with	the	new	Toy	object	in	the JSON	response:  HTTP 1.0	201	Created Allow:	GET,	OPTIONS,	POST Content-Length:	157 Content-Type:	application json Date:	Mon,	16	Oct	2017	04:40:02	GMT Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 Vary:	Accept,	Cookie X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN { 				"description":	"Ken	loves	Rome", 				"id":	6, 				"name":	"Ken	in	Rome", 				"release_date":	"2017-10-09T12:11:37.090335Z", 				"toy_category":	"Dolls", 				"was_included_in_home":	false }   Sending	HTTP	requests	with unsupported	HTTP	verbs  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	with	an	HTTP	verb	that isn't	supported	for	the	toys	resource	collection.	Run	the	following command:  http	PATCH	:8000 toys   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  curl	-iX	PATCH	localhost:8000 toys   The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	PATCH	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	request	will	try	to	run	the views.toy_list	function,	that	is,	the	toy_list	function	declared	within	the toys views.py	file.	The	@api_view	decorator	we	added	to	this	function	doesn't include	'PATCH'	in	the	string	list	with	the	allowed	HTTP	verbs.	The	default behavior	when	this	happens	in	the	APIView	class	is	to	return	an	HTTP	405 Method	Not	Allowed	status	code.	The	following	lines	show	a	sample	output with	the	response	from	the	previous	request.	A	JSON	content	provides	a detail	key	with	a	string	value	that	indicates	the	PATCH	method	is	not	allowed in	the	response	body:  				HTTP 1.0	405	Method	Not	Allowed 				Allow:	GET,	OPTIONS,	POST 				Content-Length:	42 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Mon,	16	Oct	2017	04:41:35	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie   				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"detail":	"Method	\"PATCH\"	not	allowed." 				}   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly:  1.	 The	@api_view	decorator	declared	in	the	rest_framework.decorators  module	allows	you	to:  1.	 Specify	which	is	the	model	related	to	the	function	based  2.	 Specify	which	are	the	HTTP	verbs	that	the	function	based  view	to	which	it	is	applied	can	process  3.	 Specify	which	is	the	serializer	related	to	the	function  view  based	view  2.	 The	@api_view	decorator	is	a	wrapper	that	converts	a	function	based  view	into	a	subclass	of	which	of	the	following	classes:  1.	 django.Http.Response.HttpResponse 2.	 rest_framework.views.APIView 3.	 rest_framework.serializers.Serializer  3.	 Which	of	the	following	settings	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK dictionary	allows	you	to	override	the	global	setting	with	a	tuple	of string	whose	values	indicate	the	default	classes	that	you	want	to use	for	parsing	backends:   1.	 'DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES' 2.	 'GLOBAL_PARSER_CLASSES' 3.	 'REST_FRAMEWORK_PARSING_CLASSES'  4.	 Which	of	the	following	classes	is	able	to	parse	application json content	type	when	we	work	with	the	@api_view	decorator	and	its default	settings:  1.	 django.parsers.JSONParser 2.	 rest_framework.classes.JSONParser 3.	 rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser  5.	 Which	of	the	following	classes	is	able	to	parse	application x- www-form-urlencoded	content	type	when	we	work	with	the @api_view	decorator	and	its	default	settings:  1.	 django.parsers.XWWWUrlEncodedParser 2.	 rest_framework.classes.XWWWUrlEncodedParser 3.	 rest_framework.parsers.FormParser  	  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	improved	our	simple	Django	RESTful	Web	Service. We	took	advantage	of	many	features	included	in	the	Django	REST framework	to	remove	duplicate	code	and	to	add	many	features	for	the	web service.	We	just	needed	to	edit	a	few	lines	of	code	to	enable	an	important amount	of	features.  First,	we	took	advantage	of	model	serializers.	Then,	we	understood	the different	accepted	and	returned	content	types	and	the	importance	of providing	accurate	responses	to	the	HTTP	OPTIONS	requests.  We	incorporated	the	@api_view	decorator	and	made	the	necessary	changes	to the	existing	code	to	enable	diverse	parsers	and	renderers.	We	understood how	things	worked	under	the	hood	in	the	Django	REST	framework.	We worked	with	different	content	types	and	noticed	the	improvement	of	the RESTful	Web	Service	compared	with	its	previous	versions.  Now	that	we	understand	how	easy	it	is	to	work	with	different	content types	with	the	Django	REST	framework,	we	will	work	with	one	of	the most	interesting	and	powerful	features:	the	browsable	API.	We	will	cover this	topic	in	Chapter	5,	Understanding	and	Customizing	the	Browsable	API Feature.   Understanding	and Customizing	the	Browsable API	Feature  In	this	chapter,	we	will	work	with	one	of	the	most	interesting	and	powerful features	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework:	the	browsable	API. This	feature	makes	it	easy	for	us	to	interact	with	our	RESTful	Web Services	through	any	web	browser.	We	will	gain	an	understanding	of:  Understanding	the	possibility	of	rendering	text HTML	content  Using	a	web	browser	to	work	with	our	web	service  Making	HTTP	GET	requests	with	the	browsable	API  Making	HTTP	POST	requests	with	the	browsable	API  Making	HTTP	PUT	requests	with	the	browsable	API  Making	HTTP	DELETE	requests	with	the	browsable	API  Making	HTTP	OPTIONS	requests	with	the	browsable	API   Understanding	the	possibility of	rendering	text HTML	content  In	Chapter	4,	Using	Generalized	Behavior	from	the	APIView	Class,	we made	many	changes	to	make	it	possible	for	the	simple	RESTful	Web Service	to	work	with	a	content	negotiation	class	and	provide	many	content renderers.	We	used	the	default	configuration	for	the	Django	REST framework	that	includes	a	renderer	that	produces	text html	content.  The	rest_framework.response.BrowsableAPIRenderer	class	is	responsible	for rendering	the	text html	content.	This	class	makes	it	possible	for	us	to browse	the	API.	The	Django	REST	framework	includes	a	feature	that generates	an	interactive	and	human-friendly	HTML	output	for	the different	resources	when	the	request	specifies	text html	as	the	value	for	the Content-Type	key	in	the	request	header.	This	feature	is	known	as	the browsable	API	because	it	enables	us	to	use	a	web	browser	to	navigate through	the	API	and	easily	make	different	types	of	HTTP	requests.  The	browsable	API	feature	is	extremely	useful	when	we	have to	test	the	RESTful	Web	Services	that	perform	CRUD operations	on	a	database,	such	as	the	one	we	have	been developing	in	Chapter	4,	Using	Generalized	Behavior	from	the APIView	Class.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	that	will	make	the RESTful	Web	Service	user	the	BrowsableAPIRenderer	class	to	provide	text html content	in	the	response.	This	way,	we	will	understand	how	the	browsable API	works	before	we	jump	into	the	web	browser	and	we	start	using	and customizing	this	feature.	In	case	you	stopped	Django's	development server,	you	will	have	to	start	it	again	as	we	learned	in	Chapter	3,	Creating API	Views,	in	the	section	Launching	Django's	development	server,	to	start running	the	Django	development	server.   Run	the	following	command	to	retrieve	all	the	toys	with	the	Accept	request header	key	set	to	text html.	Remember	that	the	virtual	environment	we created	in	the	previous	chapters	must	be	activated	in	order	to	run	the	next http	command:  	http	-v	:8000 toys 	"Accept:text html"  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  	curl	-vH	"Accept:	text html"	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 toys   The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	These	commands	specify	the text html	value	for	the	Accept	key	in	the	request	header.	This	way,	the	HTTP request	indicates	that	it	accepts	a	response	of	text html.  In	both	cases,	we	specified	the	-v	option	that	provides	a	verbose	output	and prints	the	details	of	the	request	that	has	been	made.	For	example,	the following	are	the	first	lines	of	the	output	generated	by	the	http	command:  				GET	 toys 	HTTP 1.1 				Accept:	text html 				Accept-Encoding:	gzip,	deflate 				Connection:	keep-alive 				Host:	localhost:8000 				User-Agent:	HTTPie 0.9.3  The	second	line	prints	the	value	for	the	Accept	key	included	in	the	request header,	text html.	The	header	response	for	the	request	will	include	the following	line:  				Content-Type:	text html;	charset=utf-8  The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP   request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	request	will	end	up	running	the views.toy_list	function,	that	is,	the	toy_list	function	declared	within	the toys views.py	file.	The	content	negotiation	class	selected	the BrowsableAPIRenderer	class	to	provide	text html	content	in	the	response.	The following	lines	show	the	first	lines	of	the	output	for	the	http	command:  We	can	easily	detect	from	the	previous	output	that	the	Django	REST framework	provides	an	HTML	web	page	as	a	response	to	our	previous requests.	If	we	enter	any	URL	for	a	resource	collection	or	resource	in	any web	browser,	the	browser	will	perform	an	HTTP	GET	request	that	requires an	HTML	response,	that	is,	the	Accept	request	header	key	will	be	set	to text html.	The	web	service	built	with	the	Django	REST	framework	will provide	an	HTML	response	and	the	browser	will	render	the	web	page.  By	default,	the	BrowsableAPIRenderer	class	uses	the	Bootstrap	popular frontend	component	library.	You	can	read	more	about	Bootstrap	here:	http:   getbootstrap.com.	The	web	page	might	include	the	following	elements:  Diverse	buttons	to	perform	other	requests	to	the	resource	or resource	collection  A	section	that	displays	the	resource	or	resource	collection	content in	JSON   Forms	with	fields	that	allow	us	to	submit	data	for	POST,	PUT,	and PATCH	requests  The	Django	REST	framework	uses	templates	and	themes	to	render	the pages	for	the	browsable	API.	It	is	possible	to	customize	many	settings	to tailor	the	output	to	our	specific	requirements.   Using	a	web	browser	to	work with	our	web	service  Let's	start	browsing	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	Open	a	web	browser	and enter	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	browser	will	compose	and	send	a	GET request	to	http:  localhost:8000 toys 	with	text html	as	the	desired	content type	and	the	returned	HTML	web	page	will	be	rendered.  Under	the	hood,	the	web	service	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	GET request	to	http:  localhost:8000 toys 	with	application json	as	the	content	type and	the	headers,	and	the	JSON	returned	by	this	request	will	be	rendered	as part	of	the	content	of	the	web	page.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the rendered	web	page	with	the	resource	collection	description,	Toy	List:  When	we	work	with	the	browsable	API,	Django	uses	the	information   about	the	allowed	methods	for	a	resource	or	resource	collection	to	render the	appropriate	buttons	to	allow	us	to	execute	the	related	requests.	In	the previous	screenshot,	you	will	notice	that	there	are	two	buttons	on	the right-hand	side	of	the	resource	description	 Toy	List :	OPTIONS	and GET.	We	will	use	the	different	buttons	to	make	additional	requests	to	the RESTful	Web	Service.  If	you	decide	to	browse	the	web	service	in	a	web	browser	that	is	being executed	on	another	computer	or	device	connected	to	the	LAN,	you	will have	to	use	the	assigned	IP	address	to	the	computer	that	is	running Django's	development	server	instead	of	localhost.	For	example,	if	Django's development	server	is	running	on	a	computer	whose	assigned	IPv4	IP address	is	192.168.2.125,	instead	of	http:  localhost:8000 toys ,	you	should	use http:  192.168.2.125:8000 toys .	You	can	also	use	the	hostname	instead	of	the IPv4	address	or	an	IPv6	address.  One	of	the	nicest	features	of	the	browsable	API	is	that	it	makes	it extremely	easy	to	test	a	RESTful	Web	Service	from	a	mobile	device.  As	a	disclaimer,	I	must	say	that	once	you	learn	how	to	take	advantage	of the	browsable	API,	you	will	never	want	to	work	with	a	framework	that doesn't	provide	a	feature	like	this	one.   Making	HTTP	GET	requests with	the	browsable	API  We	just	made	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	retrieve	the	toys	resource collection	with	the	browsable	API.	Now,	we	will	compose	and	send another	HTTP	GET	request	for	an	existing	toy	resource	with	the	web browser.  Enter	the	URL	for	an	existing	toy	resource,	such	as http:  localhost:8000 toys 3.	Make	sure	you	replace	3	with	the	id	or	primary key	of	an	existing	toy	in	the	previously	rendered	Toy	List.	Django	will compose	and	send	a	GET	request	to	http:  localhost:8000 toys 3	and	the rendered	web	page	will	display	the	results	of	its	execution,	that	is,	the headers	and	the	JSON	data	for	the	toy	resource.	The	following	screenshot shows	the	rendered	web	page	after	entering	the	URL	in	a	web	browser with	the	resource	description,	Toy	Detail:  At	the	right-hand	side	of	the	resource	description,	the	browsable	API   shows	a	GET	drop-down	button.	This	button	allows	us	to	make	a	GET request	to	 toys 3	again.	If	we	click	or	tap	the	down	arrow,	we	can	select the	json	option	and	the	browsable	API	will	display	the	raw	JSON	results of	a	GET	request	to	 toys 3	without	the	headers.	In	fact,	the	browser	will	go to	http:  localhost:8000 toys 3?format=json	and	the	Django	REST	framework will	display	the	raw	JSON	results	because	the	value	for	the	format	query parameter	is	set	to	json.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	results	of making	that	request:  Enter	the	URL	for	a	non-existing	toy	resource,	such	as http:  localhost:8000 toys 250.	Make	sure	you	replace	250	with	the	id	or primary	key	of	the	toy	that	doesn't	exist	in	the	previously	rendered	Toy List.	Django	will	compose	and	send	a	GET	request	to http:  localhost:8000 toys 250	and	the	rendered	web	page	will	display	the results	of	its	execution,	that	is,	the	header	with	the	HTTP	404	Not	found	status code.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	rendered	web	page	after	entering	the URL	in	a	web	browser:    Making	HTTP	POST	requests with	the	browsable	API  Now,	we	want	to	use	the	browsable	API	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP POST	request	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service	to	create	a	new	toy.	Go	to	the following	URL	in	your	web	browser,	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	At	the bottom	of	the	rendered	web	page,	the	browsable	API	displays	the following	controls	to	allow	us	to	compose	and	send	a	POST	request	to	 toys :  Media	type:	This	dropdown	allows	us	to	select	the	desired	parser. The	list	will	be	generated	based	on	the	configured	supported parsers	in	the	Django	REST	framework	for	our	web	service.  Content:	This	text	area	allows	us	to	enter	the	text	for	the	body	that will	be	sent	with	the	POST	request.	The	content	must	be compatible	with	the	selected	value	for	the	media	type	dropdown.  POST:	This	button	will	use	the	selected	media	type	and	the entered	content	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request	with the	appropriate	header	key value	pairs	and	content.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	previously	explained	controls	at	the bottom	of	the	rendered	web	page:   We	enabled	all	the	default	parsers	provided	by	the	Django	REST framework	for	our	RESTful	Web	Service,	and	therefore,	the	Media	type drop-down	will	provide	us	with	the	following	options:  application json  application x-www-form-urlencoded  multipart form-data  Select	application json	in	the	Media	type	dropdown	and	enter	the following	JSON	content	in	the	Content	text	area:  {	 				"name":	"Surfer	girl",	 				"description":	"Surfer	girl	doll",	 				"toy_category":"Dolls",	 				"was_included_in_home":	"false",	 				"release_date":	"2017-10-29T12:11:25.090335Z"	 }	   Click	or	tap	POST.	The	browsable	API	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP POST	request	to	 toys 	with	the	previously	specified	data	as	a	JSON	body, and	we	will	see	the	results	of	the	call	in	the	web	browser.  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	web	browser	displaying	the	HTTP status	code	201	Created	in	the	response	and	the	previously	explained dropdown	and	text	area	with	the	POST	button	to	allow	us	to	continue composing	and	sending	POST	requests	to	 toys :  In	this	case,	we	entered	the	JSON	key value	pairs	as	we	did when	we	composed	and	sent	HTTP	POST	requests	with command-line	and	GUI	tools.	However,	we	will	learn	to configure	the	browsable	API	to	provide	us	with	a	form	with fields	to	make	it	even	easier	to	perform	operations	on	our RESTful	Web	Service.   Making	HTTP	PUT	requests with	the	browsable	API  Now,	we	want	to	use	the	browsable	API	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP PUT	request	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service	to	replace	an	existing	toy	with	a new	one.	First,	go	to	the	URL	for	an	existing	toy	resource,	such	as http:  localhost:8000 toys 7.	Make	sure	you	replace	7	with	the	id	or	primary key	of	an	existing	toy	in	the	previously	rendered	Toy	List.	The	HTML	web page	that	displays	the	results	of	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	 toys 7	plus additional	details	and	controls	will	be	rendered.  At	the	bottom	of	the	rendered	web	page,	the	browsable	API	displays	the controls	to	compose	and	send	a	POST	request	to	 toys 	followed	by	the controls	to	compose	and	send	a	PUT	request	to	 toys 7.	The	controls	for	the PUT	request	are	the	same	that	we	already	analyzed	for	the	POST	request. The	PUT	button	will	use	the	selected	media	type	and	the	entered	content to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	PUT	request	with	the	appropriate	header key value	pairs	and	content.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	controls	to	compose	and	send	an HTTP	PUT	request	at	the	bottom	of	the	rendered	web	page:   In	this	example,	we	took	advantage	of	the	features	included in	the	Django	REST	framework	to	build	the	OPTIONS response	that	indicates	which	HTTP	verbs	are	allowed	for each	resource	and	resource	collection.	Thus,	the	browsable API	only	offers	us	the	possibility	to	compose	and	send	a POST	and	PUT	methods.	The	POST	method	is	applied	to	the resource	collection	while	the	PUT	method	is	applied	to	a single	resource.	The	browsable	API	doesn't	provide	the controls	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	PATCH	method	on	a resource	because	the	code	hasn't	specified	that	this	verb	is accepted	as	a	resource.  Select	application json	in	the	Media	type	dropdown	and	enter	the following	JSON	content	in	the	Content	text	area.	Remember	that	the HTTP	PUT	method	replaces	an	existing	resource	with	a	new	one,	and   therefore,	we	must	specify	the	values	for	all	the	fields	and	not	just	for	the fields	that	we	want	to	update:  {	 				"name":	"Surfer	girl",	 				"description":	"Surfer	girl	doll	 includes	pink	surfboard ",	 				"toy_category":"Dolls",	 				"was_included_in_home":	"false",	 				"release_date":	"2017-10-29T12:11:25.090335Z"	 }	  Click	or	tap	PUT.	The	browsable	API	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	PUT request	to	 toys 7	with	the	previously	specified	data	as	a	JSON	body	and we	will	see	the	results	of	the	call	in	the	web	browser.	The	following screenshot	shows	a	web	browser	displaying	the	HTTP	status	code	200	OK	in the	response,	and	the	controls	to	allow	us	to	send	a	new	PUT	request,	if necessary:    Making	HTTP	OPTIONS requests	with	the	browsable API  Now,	we	want	to	use	the	browsable	API	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP OPTIONS	request	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service	to	check	the	allowed HTTP	verbs,	the	available	renderers,	and	parsers	for	a	toy	resource.	First, go	to	the	URL	for	an	existing	toy	resource,	such	as http:  localhost:8000 toys 7.	Make	sure	you	replace	7	with	the	id	or	primary key	of	an	existing	toy	in	the	previously	rendered	Toy	List.	The	HTML	web page	that	displays	the	results	of	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	 toys 7	plus additional	details	and	controls	will	be	rendered.  At	the	right-hand	side	of	the	Toy	Detail	title,	you	will	see	an	OPTIONS button.	Click	or	tap	this	button.	The	browsable	API	will	compose	and	send an	HTTP	OPTIONS	request	to	 toys 7	and	we	will	see	the	results	of	the	call	in the	web	browser.	The	following	screenshot	shows	a	web	browser displaying	the	HTTP	status	code	200	OK	in	the	response,	the	allowed	HTTP verbs,	the	content	types	that	the	toy	resource	is	capable	of	rendering	as values	for	the	renders	key,	and	the	content	types	that	the	toy	resource	is capable	of	parsing	as	values	for	the	parses	key:   We	can	also	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	OPTIONS	request	to	our RESTful	Web	Service	to	check	the	allowed	HTTP	verbs,	the	available renderers,	and	parsers	for	the	toys	resource	collection.	First,	go	to	the	URL for	the	toys	resource	collection:	http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	HTML	web page	that	displays	the	results	of	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	 toys ,	plus additional	details	and	controls,	will	be	rendered.  At	the	right-hand	side	of	the	Toy	Detail	title,	you	will	see	an	OPTIONS button.	Click	or	tap	this	button.	The	browsable	API	will	compose	and	send an	HTTP	OPTIONS	request	to	 toys 	with	the	previously	specified	data	as	a JSON	body	and	we	will	see	the	results	of	the	call	in	the	web	browser.	The following	screenshot	shows	a	web	browser	displaying	the	HTTP	status code	200	OK	in	the	response,	the	allowed	HTTP	verbs,	the	content	types	that the	toys	resource	collection	is	capable	of	rendering	as	values	for	the	renders key,	and	the	content	types	that	the	toys	resource	collection	is	capable	of parsing	as	values	for	the	parses	key:   It	is	always	a	good	idea	to	check	that	all	the	allowed	verbs	returned	by	an HTTP	OPTIONS	request	to	a	specific	resource	or	resource	collection	are coded.	The	browsable	API	makes	it	easy	for	us	to	test	whether	the	requests for	all	the	supported	verbs	are	working	OK.	Then,	we	can	automate testing,	which	is	a	topic	we	will	learn	in	the	forthcoming	chapters.   Making	HTTP	DELETE	requests with	the	browsable	API  Now,	we	want	to	use	the	browsable	API	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP DELETE	request	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service	to	delete	an	existing	toy resource.	First,	go	to	the	URL	for	an	existing	toy	resource,	such	as http:  localhost:8000 toys 7.	Make	sure	you	replace	7	with	the	id	or	primary key	of	an	existing	toy	in	the	previously	rendered	Toy	List.	The	HTML	web page	that	displays	the	results	of	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	 toys 7,	plus additional	details	and	controls,	will	be	rendered.  At	the	right-hand	side	of	the	Toy	Detail	title,	you	will	see	a	DELETE button.	Click	or	tap	this	button.	The	web	page	will	display	a	modal requesting	confirmation	to	delete	the	toy	resource.	Click	or	tap	the DELETE	button	in	this	modal.  The	browsable	API	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	DELETE	request	to  toys 7	and	we	will	see	the	results	of	the	call	in	the	web	browser.	The following	screenshot	shows	a	web	browser	displaying	the	HTTP	status code	204	No	Content	in	the	response:  Now,	go	to	the	URL	for	the	toys	resource	collection: http:  localhost:8000 toys .	The	HTML	web	page	that	displays	the	results	of an	HTTP	GET	request	to	 toys 	plus	additional	details	and	controls	will	be   rendered.	The	recently	deleted	toy	has	been	removed	from	the	database. Thus,	the	list	will	not	include	the	deleted	toy.​	The	following	screenshot shows	a	web	browser	displaying	the	HTTP	status	code	200	OK	in	the response	and	the	list	of	toys	without	the	recently	deleted	toy:  The	browsable	API	allowed	us	to	compose	and	send	many	HTTP	requests to	our	web	service	by	clicking	or	tapping	buttons	on	a	web	browser.	We could	check	that	all	the	operations	are	working	as	expected	in	our RESTful	Web	Service.	However,	we	had	to	enter	JSON	content	and	we couldn't	click	on	hyperlinks	to	navigate	through	entities.	For	example,	we couldn't	click	on	a	toy's	id	to	perform	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	retrieve this	specific	toy.  We	will	definitely	improve	this	situation	and	we	will	take	full	advantage   of	many	additional	features	included	in	the	browsable	API	as	we	create additional	RESTful	Web	Services.	We	will	do	this	in	the	forthcoming chapters.	We	have	just	started	working	with	the	browsable	API.   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly:  1.	 Which	of	the	following	classes	is	responsible	for	rendering	the  text html	content:  1.	 The	rest_framework.response.HtmlRenderer	class 2.	 The	rest_framework.response.TextHtmlAPIRenderer	class 3.	 The	rest_framework.response.BrowsableAPIRenderer	class  2.	 By	default,	the	browsable	API	uses	the	following	web	component  library:  1.	 Bootstrap 2.	 ReactJS 3.	 AngularJS  3.	 When	we	enter	the	URL	of	an	existing	resource	in	a	web	browser,  the	browsable	API:  1.	 Returns	a	web	page	with	just	the	JSON	response	for	an  HTTP	GET	request	to	the	resource  2.	 Returns	a	web	page	with	a	section	that	displays	the	JSON  response	for	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	the	resource	and diverse	buttons	to	perform	other	requests	to	the	resource   3.	 Returns	a	web	page	with	a	section	that	displays	the	JSON response	for	an	HTTP	OPTIONS	request	to	the	resource and	diverse	buttons	to	perform	other	requests	to	the resource  4.	 When	we	enter	the	URL	of	a	non-existing	resource	in	a	web  browser,	the	browsable	API:  1.	 Renders	a	web	page	that	displays	an	HTTP	404	not	found  2.	 Displays	a	plain	text	message	with	an	HTTP	404	not	found  3.	 Renders	a	web	page	with	the	last	toy	resource	that	was  header  error  available  5.	 If	we	enter	the	following	URL,	http:  localhost:8000 toys 10?  format=json,	and	there	is	a	toy	resource	whose	id	is	equal	to	10,	the browsable	API	will	display:  1.	 The	raw	JSON	results	of	an	HTTP	GET	request	to  http:  localhost:8000 toys   2.	 The	raw	JSON	results	of	an	HTTP	GET	request	to  http:  localhost:8000 toys 10  3.	 The	same	web	page	that	would	be	rendered	if	we	entered  http:  localhost:8000 toys 10  	  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	understood	some	of	the	additional	features	that	the Django	REST	framework	adds	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service,	the browsable	API.	We	used	a	web	browser	to	work	with	our	first	web	service built	with	Django.  We	learned	to	make	HTTP	GET,	POST,	PUT,	OPTIONS,	and	DELETE requests	with	the	browsable	API.	We	were	able	to	easily	test	CRUD operations	with	a	web	browser.	The	browsable	API	allowed	us	to	easily interact	with	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will	take	advantage	of additional	features	in	the	forthcoming	chapters.  Now	that	we	understand	how	easy	it	is	to	take	advantage	of	the	browsable API	with	the	Django	REST	framework,	we	will	move	on	to	more advanced	scenarios	and	we	will	start	a	new	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will work	with	advanced	relationships	and	serialization.	We	will	cover	these topics	in	Chapter	6,	Working	with	Advanced	Relationships	and	Serialization.   Working	with	Advanced Relationships	and	Serialization  In	this	chapter,	we	will	create	a	complex	RESTful	Web	Service	that	will persist	data	in	a	PostgreSQL	database.	We	will	work	with	different	types of	relationships	between	the	resources	and	we	will	take	advantage	of generic	classes	and	generic	views	provided	by	the	Django	REST framework	to	reduce	the	amount	of	boilerplate	code.	We	will	gain	an understanding	of:  Defining	the	requirements	for	a	complex	RESTful	Web	Service  Creating	a	new	app	with	Django  Configuring	a	new	web	service  Defining	many-to-one	relationships	with	models.ForeignKey  Installing	PostgreSQL  Running	migrations	that	generate	relationships  Analyzing	the	database  Configuring	serialization	and	deserialization	with	relationships  Defining	hyperlinks	with	serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer  Working	with	class-based	views  Taking	advantage	of	generic	classes	and	generic	views  Generalizing	and	mixing	behavior   Working	with	routing	and	endpoints  Making	requests	that	interact	with	resources	that	have relationships   Defining	the	requirements	for	a complex	RESTful	Web	Service  So	far,	our	RESTful	Web	Service	performed	CRUD	operations	on	a	single database	table.	Now,	we	want	to	create	a	more	complex	RESTful	Web Service	with	the	Django	REST	framework	to	interact	with	a	complex database	model.  A	drone	is	an	IoT	 short	for	Internet	of	Things 	device	that	interacts	with many	sensors	and	actuators,	including	digital	electronic	speed	controllers linked	to	engines,	propellers,	and	sensors.	A	drone	is	also	known	as	an Unnamed	Aerial	Vehicle	 UAV .	We	will	code	a	RESTful	Web	Service that	will	allow	us	to	register	competitions	for	drones	that	are	grouped	into drone	categories.	In	our	previous	RESTful	Web	Service,	we	had	toys grouped	in	toy	categories	and	we	used	a	string	field	to	specify	the	toy category	for	a	toy.	In	this	case,	we	want	to	be	able	to	easily	retrieve	all	the drones	that	belong	to	a	specific	drone	category.	Thus,	we	will	have	a relationship	between	a	drone	and	a	drone	category.  We	must	be	able	to	perform	CRUD	operations	on	diverse	resources	and resource	collections.	Many	resources	have	relationships	with	other resources,	and	therefore,	we	won't	work	with	simple	models.	We	will	learn how	to	establish	different	kinds	of	relationships	between	the	models.  The	following	list	enumerates	the	resources	and	the	model	name	we	will use	to	represent	them	in	a	Django	REST	framework:  Drone	categories	 DroneCategory	model   Drones	 Drone	model   Pilots	 Pilot	model    Competitions	 Competition	model   The	drone	category	 DroneCategory	model 	just	requires	a	name.  We	need	the	following	data	for	a	drone	 Drone	model :  A	foreign	key	to	a	drone	category	 DroneCategory	model   A	name  A	manufacturing	date  A	bool	value	indicating	whether	the	drone	participated	in	at	least one	competition	or	not  A	timestamp	with	the	date	and	time	in	which	the	drone	was inserted	in	the	database  We	need	the	following	data	for	a	pilot	 Pilot	model :  A	name  A	gender	value  An	integer	value	with	the	number	of	races	in	which	the	pilot participated  A	timestamp	with	the	date	and	time	in	which	the	pilot	was	inserted in	the	database  We	need	the	following	data	for	the	competition	 Competition	model :  A	foreign	key	to	a	pilot	 Pilot	model    A	foreign	key	to	a	drone	 Drone	model   A	distance	value	 measured	in	feet   A	date	in	which	the	drone	controlled	by	the	pilot	reached	the specified	distance	value  We	will	use	diverse	options	that	the	Django	REST	framework	provides	us to	materialize	the	relationship	between	resources.	This	way,	we	will	be able	to	analyze	different	configurations	that	will	make	it	possible	for	us	to know	which	is	the	best	option	based	on	the	specific	requirements	of	new web	services	that	we	will	develop	in	the	future.  The	following	table	shows	the	HTTP	verbs,	the	scope	and	the	semantics for	the	methods	that	our	new	RESTful	Web	Service	must	support.	Each method	is	composed	by	an	HTTP	verb	and	a	scope.	All	the	methods	have well-defined	meanings	for	all	the	resources	and	resource	collections.	In this	case,	we	will	implement	the	PATCH	HTTP	verb	for	all	the	resources:  HTTP verb  Scope  Semantics  GET  Drone category  GET  Collection of	drone categories  Retrieve	a	single	drone	category. The	drone	category	must	include	a list	of	URLs	for	each	drone resource	that	belongs	to	the	drone category.  Retrieve	all	the	stored	drone categories	in	the	collection,	sorted by	their	name	in	ascending	order. Each	drone	category	must	include	a list	of	URLs	for	each	drone resource	that	belongs	to	the	drone   POST  PUT  PATCH  Collection of	drone categories  Drone category  Drone category  DELETE Drone  category  GET  Drone  GET  Collection of	drones  category.  Create	a	new	drone	category	in	the collection.  Update	an	existing	drone	category.  Update	one	or	more	fields	of	an existing	drone	category.  Delete	an	existing	drone	category.  Retrieve	a	single	drone.	The	drone must	include	its	drone	category description.  Retrieve	all	the	stored	drones	in	the collection,	sorted	by	their	name	in ascending	order.	Each	drone	must include	its	drone	category description.  POST  Collection of	drones  Create	a	new	drone	in	the collection.  PUT  Drone  Update	an	existing	drone.  PATCH  Drone  Update	one	or	more	fields	of	an existing	drone.  DELETE Drone  Delete	an	existing	drone.   GET  Pilot  GET  Collection of	pilots  POST  Collection of	pilots  Retrieve	a	single	pilot.	The	pilot must	include	a	list	of	the	registered competitions,	sorted	by	distance	in descending	order.	The	list	must include	all	the	details	for	the competition	in	which	the	pilots	and his	related	drone	participated.  Retrieve	all	the	stored	pilots	in	the collection,	sorted	by	their	name	in ascending	order.	Each	pilot	must include	a	list	of	the	registered competitions,	sorted	by	distance	in descending	order.	The	list	must include	all	the	details	for	the competition	in	which	the	pilot	and his	related	drone	participated.  Create	a	new	pilot	in	the	collection.  PUT  Pilot  Update	an	existing	pilot.  PATCH  Pilot  Update	one	or	more	fields	of	an existing	pilot.  DELETE Pilot  Delete	an	existing	pilot.  GET  Competition  Retrieve	a	single	competition.	The competition	must	include	the	pilot's name	that	made	the	drone	reach	a specific	distance	and	the	drone's name.   GET  Collection of competitions  Retrieve	all	the	stored	competitions in	the	collection,	sorted	by	distance in	descending	order.	Each competition	must	include	the	pilot's name	that	made	the	drone	reach	a specific	distance	and	the	drone's name.  POST  PUT  PATCH  Collection of competitions  Create	a	new	competition	in	the collection.	The	competition	must	be related	to	an	existing	pilot	and	an existing	drone.  Competition Update	an	existing	competition. Competition Update	one	or	more	fields	of	an  existing	competition.  DELETE Competition Delete	an	existing	competition.  	  In	the	previous	table,	we	have	a	huge	number	of	methods	and	scopes.	The following	table	enumerates	the	URIs	for	each	scope	mentioned	in	the previous	table,	where	{id}	has	to	be	replaced	with	the	numeric	id	or primary	key	of	the	resource:  Scope  Collection	of	drone	categories  Drone	category  Collection	of	drones  URI   drone-categories    drone-category {id}   drones    Drone  Pilot  Collection	of	pilots  Collection	of	competitions  Competition  	   drone {id}   pilots    pilot {id}   competitions    competition {id}  Let's	consider	that	http:  localhost:8000 	is	the	URL	for	the	RESTful	Web Service	running	on	Django's	development	server.	We	have	to	compose	and send	an	HTTP	request	with	the	following	HTTP	verb	 GET 	and	request URL	 http:  localhost:8000 competitions  	to	retrieve	all	the	stored competitions	in	the	collection.  GET	http:  localhost:8000 competitions 	  Our	RESTful	Web	Service	must	be	able	to	update	a	single	field	for	an existing	resource.	In	order	to	make	this	possible,	we	will	implement	the PATCH	method.	Remember	that	the	PUT	method	is	meant	to	replace	an	entire resource	and	the	PATCH	method	is	meant	to	apply	a	delta	to	an	existing resource,	that	is,	to	update	one	or	more	fields	for	an	existing	resource.  We	definitely	want	our	RESTful	Web	Serice	to	support	the	OPTIONS	method for	all	the	resources	and	collections	of	resources.	This	way,	we	will provide	a	consistent	web	service.  We	will	use	the	ORM	 short	for	Object-Relational	Mapping 	included	in Django.	In	addition,	we	will	take	advantage	of	many	features	and	reusable elements	included	in	the	latest	version	of	the	Django	REST	framework	to make	it	easy	to	build	our	web	service	without	writing	a	huge	amount	of   code.  In	this	case,	we	will	work	with	a	PostgreSQL	database.	However,	in	case you	don't	want	to	spend	time	installing	PostgreSQL,	you	can	skip	the changes	we	make	in	the	Django	REST	framework	ORM	configuration	and continue	working	with	the	default	SQLite	database,	as	we	did	with	our first	RESTful	Web	Service.   Creating	a	new	app	with Django  Now,	we	will	create	a	new	app	with	Django.	We	will	follow	the	same steps	we	learned	in	Chapter	1,	Installing	the	Required	Software	and	Tools,	in the	Creating	an	app	with	Django	section.	However,	in	order	to	avoid repeating	many	steps,	we	will	use	the	same	restful01	project	we	had created	in	that	chapter.	Hence,	we	will	just	add	a	new	app	to	an	existing project.  Make	sure	you	quit	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you	just need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	command-prompt	window	in which	it	is	running.	In	case	you	weren't	running	Django's	development server,	make	sure	the	virtual	environment	in	which	we	have	been	working in	the	previous	chapter	is	activated.	Then,	go	to	the	restful01	folder	within the	01	folder	 the	root	folder	for	our	virtual	environment .	The	following commands	use	the	default	paths	to	go	to	this	folder.	In	case	you	have	used a	different	path	for	your	virtual	environment,	make	sure	you	replace	the base	path	with	the	appropriate	one.  In	Linux	or	macOS,	enter	the	following	command:  cd	~ HillarDjangoREST 01 restful01  If	you	prefer	the	Command	Prompt,	run	the	following	command	in	the Windows	command	line:  cd	 d	%USERPROFILE%\HillarDjangoREST\01\restful01  If	you	prefer	Windows	PowerShell,	run	the	following	command	in   Windows	PowerShell:  cd	 d	$env:USERPROFILE\HillarDjangoREST\01\restful01 		  Then,	run	the	following	command	to	create	a	new	Django	app	named drones	within	the	restful01	Django	project.	The	command	won't	produce	any output:  				python	manage.py	startapp	drones  The	previous	command	creates	a	new	restful01 drones	sub-folder,	with	the following	files:  views.py  tests.py  models.py  apps.py  admin.py  __init__.py  In	addition,	the	restful01 drones	folder	will	have	a	migrations	sub-folder	with an	__init__.py	Python	script.	The	structure	is	the	same	as	the	one	we analyzed	in	Chapter	1,	Installing	the	Required	Software	and	Tools,	in	the Understanding	Django	folders,	files	and	configurations	section.   Configuring	a	new	web	service  We	added	a	new	Django	app	to	our	existing	Django	project.	Use	your favorite	editor	or	IDE	to	check	the	Python	code	in	the	apps.py	file	within the	restful01 drones	folder	 restful01\drones	in	Windows .	The	following	lines show	the	code	for	this	file:  from	django.apps	import	AppConfig	 	 	 class	DronesConfig AppConfig :	 				name	=	'drones'  The	code	declares	the	DronesConfig	class	as	a	subclass	of	the django.apps.AppConfig	class	that	represents	a	Django	application	and	its configuration.	The	DronesConfig	class	just	defines	the	name	class	attribute	and sets	its	value	to	'drones'.  Now,	we	have	to	add	drones.apps.DronesConfig	as	one	of	the	installed	apps	in the	restful01 settings.py	file	that	configures	settings	for	the	restful01	Django project.	I	built	the	previous	string	by	concatenating	many	values	as follows:	app	name	+	.apps.	+	class	name,	which	is,	drones	+	.apps.	+ DronesConfig.  We	already	added	the	rest_framework	app	to	make	it	possible for	us	to	use	the	Django	REST	framework	in	the restful01 settings.py	file.	However,	in	case	you	decided	to create	a	new	Django	project	from	scratch	by	following	all the	steps	we	learned	in	Chapter	1,	Installing	the	Required Software	and	Tools,	make	sure	you	don't	forget	to	add	the rest_framework	app.  Open	the	restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares	module-level	variables	that   define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project.	We	will	make some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file.	Locate	the	lines	that	assign	a strings	list	to	INSTALLED_APPS	to	declare	the	installed	apps.  Remove	the	following	line	from	the	INSTALLED_APPS	strings	list.	This	way, Django	won't	consider	this	app	anymore:  'toys.apps.ToysConfig',	  Add	the	following	string	to	the	INSTALLED_APPS	strings	list	and	save	the changes	to	the	restful01 settings.py	file:  'drones.apps.DronesConfig',  The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	that	declares	the	INSTALLED_APPS strings	list	with	the	added	line	highlighted	and	with	comments	to understand	what	each	added	string	means.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 settings.py file:  INSTALLED_APPS	=	[	 				'django.contrib.admin',	 				'django.contrib.auth',	 				'django.contrib.contenttypes',	 				'django.contrib.sessions',	 				'django.contrib.messages',	 				'django.contrib.staticfiles',	 					Django	REST	framework	 				'rest_framework',	 					Drones	application	 				'drones.apps.DronesConfig',	 ]	  This	way,	we	have	added	the	drones	application	to	our	initial	Django project	named	restful01.   Defining	many-to-one relationships	with models.ForeignKey  Now,	we	will	create	the	models	that	we	will	use	to	represent	and	persist the	drone	categories,	drones,	pilots,	and	competitions,	and	their relationships.	Open	the	drones models.py	file	and	replace	its	contents	with	the following	code.	The	lines	that	declare	fields	related	to	other	models	are highlighted	in	the	code	listing.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in the	hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones models.py	file.  from	django.db	import	models	 	 	 class	DroneCategory models.Model :	 				name	=	models.CharField max_length=250 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	 	 				def	__str__ self :	 								return	self.name	 	 	 class	Drone models.Model :	 				name	=	models.CharField max_length=250 	 				drone_category	=	models.ForeignKey 	 								DroneCategory,	 								related_name='drones',	 								on_delete=models.CASCADE 	 				manufacturing_date	=	models.DateTimeField  	 				has_it_competed	=	models.BooleanField default=False 	 				inserted_timestamp	=	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	 	 				def	__str__ self :	   								return	self.name	 	 	 class	Pilot models.Model :	 				MALE	=	'M'	 				FEMALE	=	'F'	 				GENDER_CHOICES	=	 	 								 MALE,	'Male' ,	 								 FEMALE,	'Female' ,	 				 	 				name	=	models.CharField max_length=150,	blank=False,	default='' 	 				gender	=	models.CharField 	 								max_length=2,	 								choices=GENDER_CHOICES,	 								default=MALE,	 				 	 				races_count	=	models.IntegerField  	 				inserted_timestamp	=	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	 	 				def	__str__ self :	 								return	self.name	 	 	 class	Competition models.Model :	 				pilot	=	models.ForeignKey 	 								Pilot,	 								related_name='competitions',	 								on_delete=models.CASCADE 	 				drone	=	models.ForeignKey 	 								Drone,	 								on_delete=models.CASCADE 	 				distance_in_feet	=	models.IntegerField  	 				distance_achievement_date	=	models.DateTimeField  	 	 				class	Meta:	 									Order	by	distance	in	descending	order	 								ordering	=	 '-distance_in_feet',   The	code	declares	the	following	four	models,	specifically,	four	classes	that are	subclasses	of	the	django.db.models.Model	class:  DroneCategory   Drone  Pilot  Competition  Django	automatically	adds	an	auto-increment	integer	primary	key	column named	id	when	it	creates	the	database	table	related	to	each	model.	We specify	the	field	types,	maximum	lengths,	and	defaults	for	many	attributes.  Each	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	an	ordering	attribute. The	Meta	inner	class	declared	within	the	Competition	class	specifies	'- distance_in_feet'	as	the	value	of	the	ordering	tuple,	with	a	dash	as	a	prefix	of the	field	name	to	order	by	distance_in_feet	in	descending	order,	instead	of the	default	ascending	order.  The	DroneCategory,	Drone,	and	Pilot	classes	declare	a	__str__	method	that returns	the	contents	of	the	name	attribute	that	provides	the	name	or	title	for each	of	these	models.	This	way,	whenever	Django	needs	to	provide	a human	readable	representation	for	the	model,	it	will	call	this	method	and return	its	result.  The	Drone	model	declares	the	drone_category	field	with	the	following	line:  drone_category	=	models.ForeignKey 	 				DroneCategory,		 				related_name='drones',		 				on_delete=models.CASCADE 	  The	previous	line	uses	the	django.db.models.ForeignKey	class	to	provide	a many-to-one	relationship	to	the	DroneCategory	model.	The	'drones'	value specified	for	the	related_name	argument	creates	a	backwards	relation	from the	DroneCategory	model	to	the	Drone	model.	This	value	indicates	the	name	to use	for	the	relation	from	the	related	DroneCategory	object	back	to	a	Drone object.   This	way,	we	will	be	able	to	easily	access	all	the	drones	that	belong	to	a specific	drone	category.	Whenever	we	delete	a	drone	category,	we	want	all the	drones	that	belong	to	this	category	to	be	deleted,	too,	and	therefore,	we specified	the	models.CASCADE	value	for	the	on_delete	argument.  The	Competition	model	declares	the	pilot	field	with	the	following	line:  pilot	=	models.ForeignKey 	 				Pilot,		 				related_name='competitions',		 				on_delete=models.CASCADE 	  The	previous	line	uses	the	django.db.models.ForeignKey	class	to	provide	a many-to-one	relationship	to	the	Pilot	model.	The	'competitions'	value specified	for	the	related_name	argument	creates	a	backwards	relation	from the	Pilot	model	to	the	Competition	model.	This	value	indicates	the	name	to use	for	the	relation	from	the	related	Pilot	object	back	to	a	Competition object.  This	way,	we	will	be	able	to	easily	access	all	the	competitions	in	which	a specific	pilot	participated	with	his	drone.	Whenever	we	delete	a	pilot,	we want	all	the	competitions	in	which	this	pilot	participated	to	be	deleted,	too, and	therefore,	we	specified	the	models.CASCADE	value	for	the	on_delete argument.  The	Competition	model	declares	the	drone	field	with	the	following	line:  drone	=	models.ForeignKey 	 				Drone,		 				on_delete=models.CASCADE 	  The	previous	line	uses	the	django.db.models.ForeignKey	class	to	provide	a many-to-one	relationship	to	the	Drone	model.	In	this	case,	we	don't	create	a backwards	relation	because	we	don't	need	it.	Thus,	we	don't	specify	a value	for	the	related_name	argument.	Whenever	we	delete	a	drone,	we	want all	the	competitions	in	which	the	drone	participated	to	be	deleted	too,	and   therefore,	we	specified	the	models.CASCADE	value	for	the	on_delete	argument.   Installing	PostgreSQL  In	order	to	work	with	this	example,	you	have	to	download	and	install PostgreSQL,	in	case	you	aren't	already	running	it	in	your	development computer	or	in	a	development	server.	PostgreSQL	is	available	on	multiple platforms	and	offers	versions	for	Linux,	macOS	and	Windows,	among other	operating	systems.	You	can	download	and	install	this	relational database	management	system	from	the	Download	section	of	its	web	page:	 http:  www.postgresql.org.  The	next	samples	that	work	with	a	PostgreSQL	database	have	been	tested in	PostgreSQL	versions	9.6.x	and	PostgreSQL	10.x.	Make	sure	you	work with	any	of	these	versions.  There	are	interactive	installers	built	by	EnterpriseDB	and	BigSQL	for macOS	and	Windows.	In	case	you	are	working	with	macOS,	Postgres.app provides	a	really	easy	way	to	install	and	use	PostgreSQL	on	this	operating system.	You	can	read	more	about	Postgres.app	and	download	it	from	its web	page:	http:  postgresapp.com.  After	you	finish	the	installation	process,	you	have	to	make	sure	that	the PostgreSQL	bin	folder	is	included	in	the	PATH	environmental	variable. You	should	be	able	to	execute	the	psql	command-line	utility	from	your current	Linux	or	macOS	terminal,	the	Windows	command	prompt,	or Windows	PowerShell.  In	case	the	bin	folder	isn't	included	in	the	PATH,	you	will receive	an	error	indicating	that	the	pg_config	file	cannot	be found	when	trying	to	install	the	psycopg2	Python	package.	In addition,	you	will	have	to	use	the	full	path	to	each	of	the PostgreSQL	command-line	tools	that	we	will	use	in	the	next steps.   Running	migrations	that generate	relationships  We	must	create	the	initial	migration	for	the	new	models	we	recently coded.	We	just	need	to	run	the	following	Python	scripts	and	we	will	also synchronize	the	database	for	the	first	time.	As	we	learned	from	our previous	RESTful	Web	Service	sample,	by	default,	Django	uses	an	SQLite database.  In	this	new	example,	we	will	be	working	with	a	PostgreSQL	database. However,	in	case	you	want	to	use	an	SQLite,	you	can	skip	all	the	next steps	related	to	PostgreSQL,	its	configuration	in	Django,	and	jump	to	the migrations	generation	command.	You	will	also	have	to	use	the	SQLite utilities	instead	of	the	PostgreSQL	tools	to	analyze	the	database.  We	will	use	the	PostgreSQL	command-line	tools	to	create	a	new	database named	toys.	In	case	you	already	have	a	PostgreSQL	database	with	this name,	make	sure	that	you	use	another	name	in	all	the	commands	and configurations.	You	can	perform	the	same	tasks	with	any	PostgreSQL	GUI tool	or	any	database	administration	tool	that	supports	PostgreSQL.  In	case	you	are	developing	in	Linux,	it	is	necessary	to	run	the	commands as	the	postgres	user.	Run	the	following	command	in	Windows	or	macOS	to create	a	new	database	named	drones.	Notice	that	the	command	won't produce	any	output	and	that	you	must	have	the	bin	folder	for	PostgreSQL command-line	tools	in	your	path:  createdb	drones  In	Linux,	run	the	following	command	to	use	the	postgres	user:   sudo	-u	postgres	createdb	drones		  Now,	we	will	use	the	psql	command-line	tool	to	run	some	SQL	statements to	create	a	specific	user	that	we	will	use	in	Django	and	assign	the necessary	roles	for	it.	In	Windows	or	macOS,	run	the	following	command to	launch	the	psql	tool:  In	macOS,	you	might	need	to	run	the	following	command	to	launch	psql with	the	postgres	user	in	case	the	previous	command	doesn't	work,	as	it	will depend	on	the	way	in	which	you	installed	and	configured	PostgreSQL:  In	Linux,	run	the	following	command	to	start	psql	with	the	postgres	user:  psql		  sudo	-u	postgres	psql		  sudo	-u	psql	  Then,	run	the	following	SQL	statements	and	finally	enter	\q	to	exit	the	psql command-line	tool.  Replace	the	username	with	your	desired	username	to	use	in	the	new database,	and	password	with	your	chosen	password.	We	will	specify	the selected	username	and	password	in	the	Django	settings	for	our	web service.  You	don't	need	to	run	the	steps	in	case	you	are	already	working	with	a specific	user	in	PostgreSQL	and	you	have	already	granted	privileges	to	the database	for	the	user:  CREATE	ROLE	username	WITH	LOGIN	PASSWORD	'password'; GRANT	ALL	PRIVILEGES	ON	DATABASE	drones	TO	username;   You	will	see	the	following	output	for	the	previous	commands:  ALTER	USER	username	CREATEDB; \q		  CREATE	ROLE GRANT ALTER	ROLE		  The	default	SQLite	database	engine	and	the	database	file	name	are specified	in	the	restful01 settings.py	Python	file.	The	following	lines	show the	default	lines	that	configure	the	database:  DATABASES	=	{	 				'default':	{	 								'ENGINE':	'django.db.backends.sqlite3',	 								'NAME':	os.path.join BASE_DIR,	'db.sqlite3' ,	 				}	 }	  We	will	work	with	PostgreSQL	instead	of	SQLite	for	this	example,	and therefore,	we	must	replace	the	declaration	of	the	DATABASES	dictionary	with the	following	lines.	The	nested	dictionary	maps	the	database	named	default with	the	django.db.backends.postgresql	database	engine,	the	desired	database name	and	its	settings.	In	this	case,	we	will	create	a	database	named	drones. Make	sure	you	specify	the	desired	database	name	in	the	value	for	the	'NAME' key	and	that	you	configure	the	user,	password,	host,	and	port	based	on your	PostgreSQL	configuration.	In	case	you	followed	the	previously explained	steps	to	configure	the	PostgreSQL	database,	use	the	settings specified	in	these	steps.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 settings.py	file:  DATABASES	=	{	 				'default':	{	 								'ENGINE':	'django.db.backends.postgresql',	 									Replace	drones	with	your	desired	database	name	 								'NAME':	'drones',	   									Replace	username	with	your	desired	user	name	 								'USER':	'username',	 									Replace	password	with	your	desired	password	 								'PASSWORD':	'password',	 									Replace	127.0.0.1	with	the	PostgreSQL	host	 								'HOST':	'127.0.0.1',	 									Replace	5432	with	the	PostgreSQL	configured	port	 									in	case	you	aren't	using	the	default	port	 								'PORT':	'5432',	 				}	 }  In	case	you	decided	to	continue	working	with	SQLite,	you don't	need	to	make	the	previous	changes	and	you	can continue	using	the	default	configuration.  We	don't	want	the	migrations	process	to	take	into	account	our	models related	to	toys	from	the	previous	web	service,	and	therefore,	we	will	make changes	to	the	code	in	the	urls.py	file	in	the	restful01	folder,	specifically, the	restful01 urls.py	file.	The	file	defines	the	root	URL	configurations,	and therefore,	we	must	remove	the	URL	patterns	declared	in	the	toys urls.py file.	The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	for	the	restful01 urls.py	file. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_06_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url,	include	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	 ]	  In	order	to	use	PostgreSQL,	it	is	necessary	to	install	a	Python-PostgreSQL Database	Adapter	that	Django	will	use	to	interact	with	a	PostgreSQL database:	the	Psycopg2	package	 psycopg2 .  In	macOS,	we	have	to	make	sure	that	the	PostgreSQL	bin	folder	is included	in	the	PATH	environmental	variable.	For	example,	in	case	the	path to	the	bin	folder	is	 Applications Postgres.app Contents Versions latest bin,	we must	execute	the	following	command	to	add	this	folder	to	the	PATH environmental	variable:   export	PATH=$PATH: Applications Postgres.app Contents Versions latest bin		  Once	we	make	sure	that	the	PostgreSQL	bin	folder	is	included	in	the	PATH environmental	variable,	we	just	need	to	run	the	following	command	to install	this	package.	Make	sure	the	virtual	environment	is	activated	before running	the	command:  pip	install	psycopg2		  The	last	lines	for	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	psycopg2	package	has been	successfully	installed:  Collecting	psycopg2 Installing	collected	packages:	psycopg2 Successfully	installed	psycopg2-2.7.3.2		  Now,	run	the	following	Python	script	to	generate	the	migrations	that	will allow	us	to	synchronize	the	PostgreSQL	database	for	the	first	time.	We will	run	the	migrations	for	the	drones	application:  python	manage.py	makemigrations	drones		  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command:  Migrations	for	'drones': drones migrations 0001_initial.py -	Create	model	Competition -	Create	model	Drone -	Create	model	DroneCategory -	Create	model	Pilot -	Add	field	drone_category	to	drone -	Add	field	drone	to	competition -	Add	field	pilot	to	competition   The	output	indicates	that	the	restful01 drones migrations 0001_initial.py	file includes	the	code	to	create	the	Competition,	Drone,	DroneCategory,	and	Pilot models.	The	following	lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	was automatically	generated	by	Django.

If	you	decided	to	continue	working	with	SQLite,	we	already learned	how	to	check	the	tables	in	the	previous	chapters.  Run	the	following	command	to	list	the	generated	tables:  psql	--username=username	--dbname=drones	--command="\dt"  The	following	lines	show	the	output	with	all	the	generated	table	names:  																							List	of	relations 					Schema													Name													Type				Owner			 				--------+----------------------------+-------+---------- 					public		auth_group																		table		username 					public		auth_group_permissions						table		username 					public		auth_permission													table		username 					public		auth_user																			table		username 					public		auth_user_groups												table		username 					public		auth_user_user_permissions		table		username 					public		django_admin_log												table		username 					public		django_content_type									table		username 					public		django_migrations											table		username 					public		django_session														table		username 					public		drones_competition										table		username 					public		drones_drone																table		username 					public		drones_dronecategory								table		username 					public		drones_pilot																table		username 				 14	rows  		  In	our	previous	example,	Django	used	the	toys_	prefix	for	the	table	related   to	the	toys	application	we	had	created.	In	this	case,	the	application	name	is drones,	and	therefore,	Django	uses	the	drones_	prefix	for	the	following	four tables	that	are	related	to	the	application:  drones_drone:	This	table	persists	the	Drone	model  drones_dronecategory:	This	table	persists	the	DroneCategory	model  drones_pilot:	This	table	persists	the	Pilot	model  drones_competition:	This	table	persists	the	Competition	model  Django's	integrated	ORM	generated	these	tables	and	the	foreign	keys based	on	the	information	included	in	our	models	and	the	code	generated during	the	migrations	process.  The	following	commands	will	allow	you	to	check	the	contents	of	the	four tables	after	we	compose	and	send	different	HTTP	requests	to	the	RESTful Web	Service,	and	these	calls	end	up	making	CRUD	operations	to	the	four tables.	The	commands	assume	that	you	are	running	PostgreSQL	on	the same	computer	in	which	you	are	running	the	command:  				psql	--username=username	--dbname=drones	--command="SELECT	*	FROM	drones_dronecategory;" 				psql	--username=username	--dbname=drones	--command="SELECT	*	FROM	drones_drone;" 				psql	--username=username	--dbname=drones	--command="SELECT	*	FROM	drones_pilot;" 				psql	--username=username	--dbname=drones	--command="SELECT	*	FROM	drones_competition;"  Instead	of	working	with	the	PostgreSQL	command-line utility,	you	can	use	a	GUI	tool	to	check	the	contents	of	the PostgreSQL	database.	You	can	use	also	the	database	tools included	in	your	favorite	IDE	to	check	the	contents	for	the SQLite	database.  As	happened	in	our	previous	example,	Django	generated	additional	tables that	it	requires	to	support	the	web	framework	and	the	authentication features	that	we	will	use	later.   Configuring	serialization	and deserialization	with relationships  The	new	RESTful	Web	Service	must	be	able	to	serialize	the	DroneCategory, Drone,	Pilot,	and	Competition	instances	into	JSON	representations	and	vice versa.	In	this	case,	we	must	pay	special	attention	to	the	relationships between	the	different	models	when	we	create	the	serializer	classes	to manage	serialization	to	JSON	and	deserialization	from	JSON.  In	our	last	version	of	the	previous	RESTful	Web	Service,	we	created	a subclass	of	the	rest_framework.serializers.ModelSerializer	class	to	make	it easier	to	generate	a	serializer	and	reduce	boilerplate	code.	In	this	case,	we will	also	declare	one	class	that	inherits	from	ModelSerializer.	The	other	three classes	will	inherit	from	the rest_framework.serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class.  The	HyperlinkedModelSerializer	is	a	type	of	ModelSerializer	that	uses hyperlinked	relationships	instead	of	primary	key	relationships,	and therefore,	it	represents	the	relationships	to	other	model	instances	with hyperlinks	instead	of	primary	key	values.	In	addition,	the HyperlinkedModelSerializer	generates	a	field	named	url	with	the	URL	for	the resource	as	its	value.	As	happens	with	ModelSerializer,	the HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class	provides	default	implementations	for	the create	and	update	methods.  Now,	go	to	the	restful01 drones	folder	and	create	a	new	Python	code	file named	serializers.py.	The	following	lines	show	the	code	that	declares	the new	DroneCategorySerializer	class.	Notice	that	we	will	add	more	classes	to this	file	later.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file:   from	rest_framework	import	serializers	 from	drones.models	import	DroneCategory	 from	drones.models	import	Drone	 from	drones.models	import	Pilot	 from	drones.models	import	Competition	 import	drones.views	 	 	 class	DroneCategorySerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer :	 				drones	=	serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField 	 								many=True,	 								read_only=True,	 								view_name='drone-detail' 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	DroneCategory	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',	 												'pk',	 												'name',	 												'drones' 	  The	DroneCategorySerializer	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	HyperlinkedModelSerializer class.	The	DroneCategorySerializer	class	declares	a	drones	attribute	that	holds an	instance	of	serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField	with	many	and	read_only	equal to	True.	This	way,	the	code	defines	a	one-to-many	relationship	that	is	read- only.  The	code	uses	the	drones	name	that	we	specified	as	the	related_name	string value	when	we	created	the	drone_category	field	as	a	models.ForeignKey	instance in	the	Drone	model.	This	way,	the	drones	field	will	provide	us	with	an	array of	hyperlinks	to	each	drone	that	belongs	to	the	drone	category.  The	view_name	value	is	'drone-detail'	to	indicate	the	browsable API	feature	to	use	the	drone	detail	view	to	render	the hyperlink	when	the	user	clicks	or	taps	on	it.	This	way,	we make	it	possible	for	the	browsable	API	to	allow	us	to	browse between	related	models.  The	DroneCategorySerializer	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	the following	two	attributes:   model:	This	attribute	specifies	the	model	related	to	the	serializer, that	is,	the	DroneCategory	class.  fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	string	whose	values indicate	the	field	names	that	we	want	to	include	in	the	serialization from	the	model	related	to	the	serializer,	that	is,	the	DroneCategory class.	We	want	to	include	both	the	primary	key	and	the	URL,	and therefore,	the	code	specified	both	'pk'	and	'url'	as	members	of	the tuple.	In	addition,	we	want	to	include	the	name	and	the	field	that provides	hyperlinks	to	each	drone	that	belongs	to	the	drone category.	Thus,	the	code	also	specifies	'name'	and	'drones'	as members	of	the	tuple.  There	is	no	need	to	override	either	the	create	or	update	methods	because	the generic	behavior	will	be	enough	in	this	case.	The	HyperlinkedModelSerializer superclass	provides	implementations	for	both	methods.   Defining	hyperlinks	with serializers.HyperlinkedModelSe rializer  Now,	add	the	following	code	to	the	serializers.py	file	to	declare	the DroneSerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file:  class	DroneSerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer :	 					Display	the	category	name	 				drone_category	=	serializers.SlugRelatedField queryset=DroneCategory.objects.all  ,	slug_field='name' 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Drone	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',	 												'name',	 												'drone_category',	 												'manufacturing_date',	 												'has_it_competed',	 												'inserted_timestamp' 	  The	DroneSerializer	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class. The	DroneSerializer	class	declares	a	drone_category	attribute	that	holds	an instance	of	serializers.SlugRelatedField	with	its	queryset	argument	set	to DroneCategory.objects.all  	and	its	slug_field	argument	set	to	'name'.  A	SlugRelatedField	is	a	read-write	field	that	represents	the	target	of	the relationship	by	a	unique	slug	attribute,	that	is,	the	description.	In	the Drone	model,	we	created	the	drone_category	field	as	a	models.ForeignKey instance.  We	want	to	display	the	drone	category	name	as	the	description	 slug	field    for	the	related	DroneCategory,	and	therefore,	we	specified	'name'	as	the	value for	the	slug_field	argument.	The	browsable	API	has	to	display	the	possible options	for	the	related	drone	category	in	a	dropdown	field	in	a	form,	and Django	will	use	the	expression	specified	in	the	queryset	argument	to retrieve	all	the	possible	instances	and	display	their	specified	slug	field.  The	DroneSerializer	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	two attributes:  model:	The	Drone	class.  fields.	In	this	case,	we	don't	want	to	include	the	primary	key,	and therefore,	the	tuple	doesn't	include	the	'pk'	string.	The drone_category	field	will	render	the	name	field	for	the	related DroneCategory.  Now,	add	the	following	code	to	the	serializers.py	file	to	declare	the CompetitionSerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file.  class	CompetitionSerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer : 					Display	all	the	details	for	the	related	drone 				drone	=	DroneSerializer   				class	Meta: 								model	=	Competition 								fields	=	  												'url', 												'pk', 												'distance_in_feet', 												'distance_achievement_date', 												'drone'   The	CompetitionSerializer	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	HyperlinkedModelSerializer class.	We	will	use	the	CompetitionSerializer	class	to	serialize	Competition instances	related	to	a	Pilot,	that	is,	to	display	all	the	competitions	in	which a	specific	Pilot	has	participated	when	we	serialize	a	Pilot.	We	want	to display	all	the	details	for	the	related	Drone,	but	we	don't	include	the	related   Pilot	because	the	Pilot	will	use	this	CompetitionSerializer	serializer.  The	CompetitionSerializer	class	declares	a	drone	attribute	that	holds	an instance	of	the	previously	coded	DroneSerializer	class.	We	created	the	drone field	as	a	models.ForeignKey	instance	in	the	Competition	model	and	we	want	to serialize	the	same	data	for	the	drone	that	we	coded	in	the	DroneSerializer class.  The	CompetitionSerializer	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	two attributes:	model	and	fields.	The	model	attribute	specifies	the	model	related	to the	serializer,	that	is,	the	Competition	class.	As	previously	explained,	we don't	include	the	'Pilot'	field	name	in	the	fields	tuple	of	string	to	avoid serializing	the	Pilot	again.	We	will	use	a	PilotSerializer	as	a	master	and	the CompetitionSerializer	as	the	detail.  Now,	add	the	following	code	to	the	serializers.py	file	to	declare	the PilotSerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file:  class	PilotSerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer :	 				competitions	=	CompetitionSerializer many=True,	read_only=True 	 				gender	=	serializers.ChoiceField 	 								choices=Pilot.GENDER_CHOICES 	 				gender_description	=	serializers.CharField 	 								source='get_gender_display',		 								read_only=True 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Pilot	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',	 												'name',	 												'gender',	 												'gender_description',	 												'races_count',	 												'inserted_timestamp',	 												'competitions' 	  The	PilotSerializer	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class. We	will	use	the	PilotSerializer	class	to	serialize	Pilot	instances	and	we	will   use	the	perviously	coded	CompetitionSerializer	class	to	serialize	all	the Competition	instances	related	to	the	Pilot.  The	PilotSerializer	class	declares	a	competitions	attribute	that	holds	and instance	of	the	previously	coded	CompetitionSerializer	class.	The	many argument	is	set	to	True	because	it	is	a	one-to-many	relationship	 one	Pilot has	many	related	Competition	instances .  We	use	the	competitions	name	that	we	specified	as	the	related_name	string value	when	we	created	the	Pilot	field	as	a	models.ForeignKey	instance	in	the Competition	model.	This	way,	the	competitions	field	will	render	each Competition	that	belongs	to	the	Pilot	by	using	the	previously	declared CompetitionSerializer.  The	Pilot	model	declared	gender	as	an	instance	of	models.CharField	with	the choices	attribute	set	to	the	Pilot.GENDER_CHOICES	string	tuple.	The	PilotSerializer class	declares	a	gender	attribute	that	holds	an	instance	of serializers.ChoiceField	with	the	choices	argument	set	to	the	Pilot.GENDER_CHOICES string	tuple.  In	addition,	the	class	declares	a	gender_description	attribute	with	read_only	set to	True	and	the	source	argument	set	to	'get_gender_display'.	The	source	string	is built	with	the	get_	prefix	followed	by	the	field	name,	gender,	and	the	_display suffix.	This	way,	the	read-only	gender_description	attribute	will	render	the description	for	the	gender	choices	instead	of	the	single	char	stored	values.  The	PilotSerializer	class	declares	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	two attributes:	model	and	fields.	The	model	attribute	specifies	the	model	related	to the	serializer,	that	is,	the	Pilot	class.	We	will	use	the	PilotSerializer	class	as a	master	and	the	CompetitionSerializer	class	as	the	detail.	As	happened	with the	previous	serializers,	the	fields	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	string whose	values	indicate	the	field	names	that	we	want	to	include	in	the serialization	from	the	related	model.  Finally,	add	the	following	code	to	the	serializers.py	file	to	declare	the PilotCompetitionSerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in the	hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file:   class	PilotCompetitionSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :	 					Display	the	pilot's	name	 				pilot	=	serializers.SlugRelatedField queryset=Pilot.objects.all  ,	slug_field='name' 	 					Display	the	drone's	name	 				drone	=	serializers.SlugRelatedField queryset=Drone.objects.all  ,	slug_field='name' 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Competition	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',	 												'pk',	 												'distance_in_feet',	 												'distance_achievement_date',	 												'pilot',	 												'drone' 	  The	PilotCompetitionSerializer	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	ModelSerializer	class. We	will	use	the	CompetitionSerializer	class	to	serialize	Competition	instances. Previously,	we	created	the	CompetitionSerializer	class	to	serialize	Competition instances	as	the	detail	of	a	Pilot.	We	will	use	the	new PilotCompetitionSerializer	class	whenever	we	want	to	display	the	related	Pilot name	and	the	related	Drone	name.  In	the	other	serializer	class,	the	CompetitionSerializer	class,	we	didn't	include any	information	related	to	the	Pilot	and	we	included	all	the	details	for	the drone.	This	new	class	is	an	example	of	the	flexibility	that	we	have	when we	declare	more	than	one	serializer	for	the	same	model.  The	PilotCompetitionSerializer	class	declares	a	pilot	attribute	that	holds	an instance	of	serializers.SlugRelatedField	with	its	queryset	argument	set	to Pilot.objects.all  	and	its	slug_field	argument	set	to	'name'.	We	created	the pilot	field	as	a	models.ForeignKey	instance	in	the	Competition	model	and	we want	to	display	the	Pilot's	name	as	the	description	 slug	field 	for	the related	Pilot.	Thus,	we	specified	'name'	as	the	slug_field.	When	the browsable	API	has	to	display	the	possible	options	for	the	related	pilot	in	a dropdown	in	a	form,	Django	will	use	the	expression	specified	in	the queryset	argument	to	retrieve	all	the	possible	pilots	and	display	their specified	slug	field.   The	PilotCompetitionSerializer	class	declares	a	drone	attribute	that	holds	an instance	of	serializers.SlugRelatedField	with	its	queryset	argument	set	to Drone.objects.all  	and	its	slug_field	argument	set	to	'name'.	We	created	the drone	field	as	a	models.ForeignKey	instance	in	the	Competition	model	and	we want	to	display	the	drone's	name	as	the	description	 slug	field 	for	the related	Drone.  We	have	coded	all	the	necessary	serializers	for	our	new	RESTful	Web Service.	The	following	table	summarizes	the	serializers	we	have.	Notice that	we	have	two	different	serializers	for	the	Competition	model:  Serializer	class	name Superclass  Related	model  DroneCategorySerializer  HyperlinkedModelSerializer  DroneCategory  DroneSerializer  HyperlinkedModelSerializer  Drone  CompetitionSerializer  HyperlinkedModelSerializer  Competition  PilotSerializer  HyperlinkedModelSerializer  Pilot  PilotCompetitionSerializer  ModelSerializer  Competition   Working	with	class-based views  We	will	write	our	RESTful	Web	Service	by	coding	class-based	views.	We will	take	advantage	of	a	set	of	generic	views	that	we	can	use	as	our	base classes	for	our	class-based	views	to	reduce	the	required	code	to	the minimum	and	reuse	the	behavior	that	has	been	generalized	in	the	Django REST	framework.  We	will	create	subclasses	of	the	two	following	generic	class	views declared	in	the	rest_framework.generics	module:  ListCreateAPIView:	This	class	view	implements	the	get	method	that retrieves	a	listing	of	a	queryset	and	the	post	method	that	creates	a model	instance  RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView:	This	class	view	implements	the	get, delete,	put,	and	patch	methods	to	retrieve,	delete,	completely	update, or	partially	update	a	model	instance  Those	two	generic	views	are	composed	by	combining	reusable	bits	of behavior	in	the	Django	REST	framework	implemented	as	mixin	classes declared	in	the	rest_framework.mixins	module.	We	can	create	a	class	that	uses multiple	inheritance	and	combine	the	features	provided	by	many	of	these mixin	classes.  The	following	line	shows	the	declaration	of	the	ListCreateAPIView	class	as the	composition	of	ListModelMixin,	CreateModelMixin,	and rest_framework.generics.GenericAPIView:   class	ListCreateAPIView mixins.ListModelMixin,	 																								mixins.CreateModelMixin,	 																								GenericAPIView :	  The	following	line	shows	the	declaration	of	the	RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView class	as	the	composition	of	RetrieveModelMixin,	UpdateModelMixin, DestroyModelMixin,	and	rest_framework.generics.GenericAPIView:  class	RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView mixins.RetrieveModelMixin,	 																																			mixins.UpdateModelMixin,	 																																			mixins.DestroyModelMixin,	 																																			GenericAPIView :	   Taking	advantage	of	generic classes	and	viewsets  Now,	we	will	create	many	Django	class-based	views	that	will	use	the previously	explained	generic	classes	combined	with	the	serializer	classes to	return	JSON	representations	for	each	HTTP	request	that	our	RESTful Web	Service	will	handle.  We	will	just	have	to	specify	a	queryset	that	retrieves	all	the	objects	in	the queryset	attribute	and	the	serializer	class	in	the	serializer_class	attribute	for each	subclass	that	we	declare.	The	behavior	coded	in	the	generic	classes will	do	the	rest	for	us.	In	addition,	we	will	declare	a	name	attribute	with	the string	name	we	will	use	to	identify	the	view.  Go	to	the	restful01 drones	folder	and	open	the	views.py	file.	Replace	the	code in	this	file	with	the	following	code	that	declares	the	required	imports	and the	class-based	views	for	our	web	service.	We	will	add	more	classes	to	this file	later.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  from	django.shortcuts	import	render	 from	rest_framework	import	generics	 from	rest_framework.response	import	Response	 from	rest_framework.reverse	import	reverse	 from	drones.models	import	DroneCategory	 from	drones.models	import	Drone	 from	drones.models	import	Pilot	 from	drones.models	import	Competition	 from	drones.serializers	import	DroneCategorySerializer	 from	drones.serializers	import	DroneSerializer	 from	drones.serializers	import	PilotSerializer	 from	drones.serializers	import	PilotCompetitionSerializer	 	 	 class	DroneCategoryList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	DroneCategory.objects.all  	   				serializer_class	=	DroneCategorySerializer	 				name	=	'dronecategory-list'	 	 	 class	DroneCategoryDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				queryset	=	DroneCategory.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneCategorySerializer	 				name	=	'dronecategory-detail'	 	 	 class	DroneList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-list'	 	 	 class	DroneDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-detail'	 	 	 class	PilotList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-list'	 	 	 class	PilotDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-detail'	 	 	 class	CompetitionList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Competition.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotCompetitionSerializer	 				name	=	'competition-list'	 	 	 class	CompetitionDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Competition.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotCompetitionSerializer	 				name	=	'competition-detail'	   Generalizing	and	mixing behavior  The	previous	classes	took	advantage	of	generalized	behavior.	Each	of	the superclasses	for	the	classes	mixed	different	generalized	behaviors.	The following	table	summarizes	the	HTTP	verbs	that	each	class-based	view	is going	to	process	and	the	scope	to	which	it	applies.	Notice	that	we	can execute	the	OPTIONS	HTTP	verb	on	any	of	the	scopes:  Class-based view	name  HTTP	verbs	that	it will	process  Scope  Collection	of	drone categories:	 drone- categories   Drone	category:  drone-category {id}  DroneCategoryList  DroneCategoryDetail  Collection	of	drones:  drones   DroneList  Drone:	 drone {id}  DroneDetail  Collection	of	Pilots:  pilots   PilotList  GET,	POST,	and OPTIONS  GET,	PUT,	PATCH, DELETE,	and OPTIONS  GET,	POST,	and OPTIONS  GET,	PUT,	PATCH, DELETE,	and OPTIONS  GET,	POST	and OPTIONS  GET,	PUT,	PATCH,   Pilot:	 Pilot {id}  PilotDetail  Collection	of competitions:  competitions   CompetitionList  Score:	 competition {id}  CompetitionDetail  DELETE	and OPTIONS  GET,	POST	and OPTIONS  GET,	PUT,	PATCH, DELETE	and OPTIONS   Working	with	routing	and endpoints  We	want	to	create	an	endpoint	for	the	root	of	our	web	service	to	make	it easy	to	browse	the	resource	collections	and	resources	provided	by	our	web service	with	the	browsable	API	feature	and	understand	how	everything works.	Add	the	following	code	to	the	views.py	file	in	the	restful01 drones folder	to	declare	the	ApiRoot	class	as	a	subclass	of	the	generics.GenericAPIView class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	ApiRoot generics.GenericAPIView :	 				name	=	'api-root'	 				def	get self,	request,	*args,	**kwargs :	 								return	Response {	 												'drone-categories':	reverse DroneCategoryList.name,	request=request ,	 												'drones':	reverse DroneList.name,	request=request ,	 												'pilots':	reverse PilotList.name,	request=request ,	 												'competitions':	reverse CompetitionList.name,	request=request 	 												} 	  The	ApiRoot	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	rest_framework.generics.GenericAPIView class	and	declares	the	get	method.	The	GenericAPIView	class	is	the	base	class for	all	the	other	generic	views	we	have	previousy	analyzed.  The	ApiRoot	class	defines	the	get	method	that	returns	a	Response	object	with key value	pairs	of	strings	that	provide	a	descriptive	name	for	the	view	and its	URL,	generated	with	the	rest_framework.reverse.reverse	function.	This URL	resolver	function	returns	a	fully	qualified	URL	for	the	view.  Go	to	the	restful01 drones	folder	and	create	a	new	file	named	urls.py.	Write the	following	code	in	this	new	file.	The	following	lines	show	the	code	for this	file	that	defines	the	URL	patterns	that	specifies	the	regular	expressions   that	have	to	be	matched	in	the	request	to	run	a	specific	method	for	a	class- based	view	defined	in	the	views.py	file.  In	the	previous	example,	we	specified	a	function	that	represented	a	view. In	this	case,	we	call	the	as_view	method	for	each	appropriate	class-based view.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url	 from	drones	import	views	 	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	 				url r'^drone-categories $',		 								views.DroneCategoryList.as_view  ,		 								name=views.DroneCategoryList.name ,	 				url r'^drone-categories  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.DroneCategoryDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.DroneCategoryDetail.name ,	 				url r'^drones $',		 								views.DroneList.as_view  ,	 								name=views.DroneList.name ,	 				url r'^drones  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.DroneDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.DroneDetail.name ,	 				url r'^pilots $',		 								views.PilotList.as_view  ,	 								name=views.PilotList.name ,	 				url r'^pilots  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.PilotDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.PilotDetail.name ,	 				url r'^competitions $',		 								views.CompetitionList.as_view  ,	 								name=views.CompetitionList.name ,	 				url r'^competitions  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.CompetitionDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.CompetitionDetail.name ,	 				url r'^$',	 								views.ApiRoot.as_view  ,	 								name=views.ApiRoot.name ,	 				]  Now,	we	have	to	replace	the	code	in	the	urls.py	file	in	the	restful01	folder, specifically,	the	restful01 urls.py	file.	The	file	defines	the	root	URL   configurations,	and	therefore,	we	must	include	the	URL	patterns	declared in	the	previously	coded	drones urls.py	file.	The	following	lines	show	the new	code	for	the	restful01 urls.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_06_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url,	include 	 urlpatterns	=	[ 				url r'^',	include 'drones.urls'  , ]   Making	requests	that	interact with	resources	that	have relationships  Now,	we	will	use	the	HTTP	command	or	its	curl	equivalents	to	compose and	send	HTTP	requests	to	the	recently	coded	RESTful	Web	Service	that allows	us	to	work	with	drone	categories,	drones,	pilots,	and	competitions. We	will	use	JSON	for	the	requests	that	require	additional	data.	Remember that	you	can	perform	the	same	tasks	with	your	favorite	GUI-	based	tool	or with	the	browsable	API.  Launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests to	our	new	unsecure	Web	service.	We	will	definitely	add	security	later.	In case	you	don't	remember	how	to	start	Django's	development	server,	check the	instructions	in	Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	in	the	Launching Django's	development	server	section.  First,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request	to	create	a	new drone	category:  http	POST	:8000 drone-categories 	name="Quadcopter"  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  curl	-iX	POST	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d	'{"name":"Quadcopter"}'	localhost:8000 drone-categories   The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	a	POST	HTTP	request	with the	specified	JSON	key value	pair.	The	request	specifies	 drone-categories , and	therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^drone-categories $'	regular	expression	and   run	the	post	method	for	the	views.DroneCategoryList	class	based	view. Remember	that	the	method	is	defined	in	the	ListCreateAPIView	superclass	and it	ends	up	calling	the	create	method	defined	in	mixins.CreateModelMixin.  If	the	new	DroneCategory	instance	was	successfully	persisted	in	the	database, the	call	to	the	method	will	return	an	HTTP	201	Created	status	code	and	the recently	persisted	DroneCategory	serialized	to	JSON	in	the	response	body. The	following	line	shows	a	sample	response	for	the	HTTP	request	with	the new	DroneCategory	object	in	the	JSON	response.	Notice	that	the	response body	includes	both	the	primary	key,	pk,	and	the	URL,	url,	for	the	created category.	The	drones	array	is	empty	because	there	aren't	drones	related	to the	recently	created	drone	category	yet.	The	response	doesn't	include	the header	to	focus	on	the	body:  { 					"drones":	[],	 					"name":	"Quadcopter",	 					"pk":	1,	 					"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drone-categories 1" }  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	HTTP	requests	to	create	two	drones	that belong	to	the	drone	category	we	recently	created:	Quadcopter.	We	specify	the drone_category	value	with	the	name	of	the	desired	drone	category.	The database	table	that	persists	the	Drone	model	 the	drones_drone	table 	will	save the	value	of	the	primary	key	of	the	related	DroneCategory	whose	name	value matches	the	one	we	provide:  				http	POST	:8000 drones 	name="WonderDrone"	drone_category="Quadcopter"	manufacturing_date="2017-07-20T02:02:00.716312Z"	has_it_competed=false	 				http	POST	:8000 drones 	name="Atom"	drone_category="Quadcopter"	manufacturing_date="2017-08-18T02:02:00.716312Z"	has_it_competed=false 		  The	following	are	the	equivalent	curl	commands:  				curl	-iX	POST	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d	'{"name":"WonderDrone",	"drone_category":"Quadcopter",	"manufacturing_date":	"2017-07-20T02:02:00.716312Z",	"has_it_competed":	"false"}'	localhost:8000 drones  				curl	-iX	POST	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d	'{"name":"Atom",	"drone_category":"Quadcopter",	"manufacturing_date":	"2017-08-18T02:02:00.716312Z",	"has_it_competed":	"false"}'	localhost:8000 drones  		   The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	two	POST	HTTP	requests with	the	specified	JSON	key value	pairs.	The	request	specifies	 toys ,	and therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^toys $'	regular	expression	and	run	the	post method	for	the	views.DroneList	class	based	view.  The	following	lines	show	sample	responses	for	the	two	HTTP	requests with	the	new	Drone	objects	in	the	JSON	responses.	Notice	that	the	response includes	only	the	URL,	url,	for	the	created	drones	and	doesn't	include	the primary	key.	The	value	for	drone_category	is	the	name	for	the	related DroneCategory:  				{ 								"drone_category":	"Quadcopter",	 								"has_it_competed":	false,	 								"inserted_timestamp":	"2017-11-03T01:58:49.135737Z",	 								"manufacturing_date":	"2017-07-20T02:02:00.716312Z",	 								"name":	"WonderDrone",	 								"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones 1" 				} 				{ 								"drone_category":	"Quadcopter",	  								"has_it_competed":	false,	 								"inserted_timestamp":	"2017-11-03T01:59:31.108031Z",	 								"manufacturing_date":	"2017-08-18T02:02:00.716312Z",	 								"name":	"Atom",	 								"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones 2" 				}		  We	can	run	the	commands	explained	in	the	Analyzing	the	database	section to	check	the	rows	that	were	inserted	in	the	tables	that	Django	created	in the	PostgreSQL	database	to	persist	the	models.	The	drone_category_id column	for	the	drones_drone	table	saves	the	value	of	the	primary	key	of	the related	row	in	the	drones_drone_category	table.	The	DroneSerializer	class	uses the	SlugRelatedField	to	display	the	name	value	for	the	related	DroneCategory.	The following	screenshot	uses	the	psql	command-line	utility	to	query	the contents	for	the	drones_drone_category	and	the	drones_drone	table	in	a   PostgreSQL	database	after	running	the	HTTP	requests:  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	retrieve	the	drone category	that	contains	the	two	drones	we	created.

The	request	has	a	number after	 drone-categories ,	and	therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^drone-categories  ?

The	name	to	use	for	the	relation	from	the	related	object  back	to	this	object  2.	 The	related	model	class	name 3.	 The	related	model	primary	key	attribute	name  2.	 If	we	use	the	following	line	to	declare	the	pilot	field	in	the  Competition	model:	pilot	=	models.ForeignKey Pilot, related_name='competitions',	on_delete=models.CASCADE .	What	will Django's	ORM	do	whenever	we	delete	a	specific	Pilot?  1.	 All	the	related	competitions	in	which	this	Pilot  participated	will	remain	without	changes	in	the	database  2.	 All	the	related	competitions	in	which	this	Pilot  participated	will	be	deleted	too  3.	 All	the	related	pilots	that	are	related	to	the	Competition  will	be	deleted	too  3.

Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	defined	the	requirements	for	a	complex	RESTful	Web Service	in	which	we	needed	to	work	with	drone	categories,	drones,	pilots, and	competitions.	We	created	a	new	app	with	Django	and	configured	the new	web	service.  We	defined	many-to-one	relationships	between	the	models	with models.ForeignKey.	We	configured	Django	to	work	with	a	PostgreSQL database.	We	executed	migrations	that	generated	tables	with	relationships between	them.	We	analyzed	the	generated	database	and	we	configured serialization	and	deserialization	for	the	models.	We	declared	two serializers	for	a	single	model	to	understand	the	flexibility	we	have	with Django	and	the	Django	REST	framework.  We	defined	hyperlinks	with	the	help	of	the	HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class and	we	worked	with	class-based	views.	In	this	case,	we	took	advantage	of generic	classes	and	generic	views	that	generalize	and	mix	predefined behaviors.	We	worked	with	routings	and	endpoints	and	we	prepared	our RESTful	Web	Service	to	work	with	the	browsable	API.	We	made	many different	HTTP	requests	to	create	and	retrieve	resources	that	have relationships	between	them.	We	did	everything	without	writing	a	huge amount	of	code.  Now	that	we	understand	how	to	work	with	class-based	views,	and	to	take advantage	of	generalized	behaviors	and	materialize	complex	relationships, we	will	add	constraints,	filtering,	searching,	ordering,	and	pagination features	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will	cover	these	topics	in	the next	chapter.   Using	Constraints,	Filtering, Searching,	Ordering,	and Pagination  In	this	chapter,	we	will	take	advantage	of	many	features	included	in	the Django	REST	framework	to	add	constraints,	pagination,	filtering, searching,	and	ordering	features	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	will	add a	huge	amount	of	features	with	a	few	lines	of	code.	We	will	gain	an understanding	of:  Browsing	the	API	with	resources	and	relationships  Defining	unique	constraints  Working	with	unique	constraints  Understanding	pagination  Configuring	pagination	classes  Making	requests	that	paginate	results  Working	with	customized	pagination	classes  Making	requests	that	use	customized	paginated	results  Configuring	filter	backend	classes  Adding	filtering,	searching,	and	ordering  Working	with	different	types	of	Django	filters  Making	requests	that	filter	results   Composing	requests	that	filter	and	order	results  Making	requests	that	perform	starts	with	searches  Using	the	browsable	API	to	test	pagination,	filtering,	searching, and	ordering   Browsing	the	API	with resources	and	relationships  We	will	take	advantage	of	the	browsable	API	feature	that	we	introduced	in Chapter	5,	Understanding	and	Customizing	the	Browsable	API	Feature, with	our	new	web	service.	Let's	start	browsing	our	new	RESTful	Web Service.	Open	a	web	browser	and	enter	http:  localhost:8000.	The	browser will	compose	and	send	a	GET	request	to	 	with	text html	as	the	desired content	type,	and	the	returned	HTML	web	page	will	be	rendered.  The	request	will	end	up	executing	the	GET	method	defined	in	the	ApiRoot class	within	the	views.py	file.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	rendered web	page	with	the	resource	description	Api	Root:  The	Api	Root	renders	the	following	hyperlinks:  http:  localhost:8000 drone-categories :	The	collection	of	drone categories   http:  localhost:8000 drones :	The	collection	of	drones  http:  localhost:8000 pilots :	The	collection	of	pilots  http:  localhost:8000 competitions :	The	collection	of	competitions  We	can	easily	access	each	resource	collection	by	clicking	or	tapping	on the	appropriate	hyperlink.	Once	we	access	each	resource	collection,	we can	perform	operations	on	the	different	resources	throughout	the browsable	API.	Whenever	we	visit	any	of	the	resource	collections,	we	can use	the	breadcrumb	to	go	back	to	the	Api	Root	that	lists	all	the	hyperlinks.  Our	new	RESTful	Web	Service	takes	advantage	of	many generic	views.	These	views	provide	many	features	for	the browsable	API	that	weren't	included	when	we	worked	with function-based	views,	and	we	will	be	able	to	use	forms	to easily	compose	and	send	HTTP	POST	requests.  Click	or	tap	on	the	URL	at	the	right-hand	side	of	drone-categories	and	the web	browser	will	go	to	http:  localhost:8000 drone-categories .	As	a	result, Django	will	render	the	web	page	for	the	Drone	Category	List.	At	the bottom	of	the	web	page,	there	are	two	tabs	to	make	an	HTTP	POST request:	Raw	data	and	HTML	form.	By	default,	the	HTML	form	tab	is activated	and	displays	an	automatically	generated	form	with	a	textbox	to enter	the	value	for	the	Name	field	to	create	a	new	drone	category.	We	can use	this	form	to	easily	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request	without having	to	deal	with	the	raw	JSON	data	as	we	did	when	working	with	the browsable	API	and	our	previous	web	service.	The	following	screenshot shows	the	HTML	form	to	create	a	new	drone	category:   HTML	forms	make	it	really	easy	to	generate	requests	to	test our	RESTful	web	service	with	the	browsable	API.  Enter	the	following	value	in	the	Name	textbox:	Octocopter.	Then,	click	or tap	POST	to	create	a	new	drone	category.	The	browsable	API	will compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request	to	 drone-categories 	with	the specified	data.	Then,	we	will	see	the	results	of	this	request	in	the	web browser.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	rendered	web	page	with	the results	of	the	previous	operation,	with	an	HTTP	status	code	of	201	Created in	the	response	and	the	previously	explained	HTML	form	with	the	POST button	that	allows	us	to	continue	composing	and	sending	HTTP	POST requests	to	 drone-categories :   Now,	you	can	go	back	to	the	Api	Root	by	clicking	on	the	link	on	the breadcrumb	and	use	the	HTML	forms	to	create	drones,	pilots,	and	finally, competitions.	For	example,	go	to	the	Api	Root	and	click	or	tap	on	the URL	at	the	right-hand	side	of	drones	and	the	web	browser	will	go	to http:  localhost:8000 drones .	As	a	result,	Django	will	render	the	web	page for	the	Drone	List.	At	the	bottom	of	the	web	page,	there	are	two	tabs	to make	an	HTTP	POST	request:	Raw	data	and	HTML	form.	By	default,	the HTML	form	tab	is	activated	and	displays	an	automatically	generated	form with	the	appropriate	controls	for	the	following	fields:  Name  Drone	category  Manufacturing	date  Has	it	competed  The	Drone	category	field	provides	a	drop-down	with	all	the	existing	drone categories	so	that	we	can	select	one	of	them	for	our	new	drone.	The	Has	it competed	field	provides	a	checkbox	because	the	underlying	field	is   Boolean.  We	can	use	this	form	to	easily	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request without	having	to	deal	with	the	raw	JSON	data	as	we	did	when	working with	the	browsable	API	and	our	previous	web	service.	The	following screenshot	shows	the	HTML	form	to	create	a	new	drone:   Defining	unique	constraints  The	RESTful	Web	Service	doesn't	use	any	constraints,	and	therefore,	it	is possible	to	create	many	drone	categories	with	the	same	name.	We	don't want	to	have	many	drone	categories	with	the	same	name.	Each	drone category	name	must	be	unique	in	the	database	table	that	persists	drone categories	 the	drones_dronecategory	table .	We	also	want	drones	and	pilots	to have	unique	names.	Hence,	we	will	make	the	necessary	changes	to	add unique	constraints	to	each	of	the	following	fields:  The	name	field	of	the	DroneCategory	model  The	name	field	of	the	Drone	model  The	name	field	of	the	Pilot	model  We	will	learn	the	necessary	steps	to	edit	existing	models	and	add constraints	to	fields	that	are	already	persisted	in	tables	and	to	propagate the	changes	in	the	underlying	database	by	running	the	already	analyzed migrations	process.  Make	sure	you	quit	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you	just need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	Command	Prompt	window	in which	it	is	running.	We	have	to	edit	the	models	and	then	execute migrations	before	starting	Django's	development	server	again.  Now,	we	will	edit	the	existing	code	that	declares	the	models	to	add	unique constraints	to	the	name	field	for	the	models	that	we	use	to	represent	and persist	the	drone	categories,	drones,	and	pilots.	Open	the	drones models.py file	and	replace	the	code	that	declares	the	DroneCategory,	Drone,	and	Pilot classes	with	the	following	code.	The	lines	that	were	edited	are	highlighted in	the	code	listing.	The	code	for	the	Competition	class	remains	without   changes.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_07_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones models.py	file:  		class	DroneCategory models.Model :	 					name	=	models.CharField max_length=250,	unique=True 	 	 					class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	 	 					def	__str__ self :	 									return	self.name	 	 	 		class	Drone models.Model :	 					name	=	models.CharField max_length=250,	unique=True 	 					drone_category	=	models.ForeignKey 	 									DroneCategory,		 									related_name='drones',		 									on_delete=models.CASCADE 	 						manufacturing_date	=	models.DateTimeField  	 						has_it_competed	=	models.BooleanField default=False 	 						inserted_timestamp	=	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	 	 				def	__str__ self :	 								return	self.name	 	 	 		class	Pilot models.Model :	 				MALE	=	'M'	 				FEMALE	=	'F'	 				GENDER_CHOICES	=	 	 								 MALE,	'Male' ,	 								 FEMALE,	'Female' ,	 				 	 				name	=	models.CharField max_length=150,	blank=False,	unique=True 	 				gender	=	models.CharField 	 								max_length=2,	 								choices=GENDER_CHOICES,	 								default=MALE,	 				 	 				races_count	=	models.IntegerField  	 				inserted_timestamp	=	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	   	 				def	__str__ self :	 								return	self.name	  We	added	unique=True	as	one	of	the	named	arguments	for	each	call	to	the models.CharField	initializer.	This	way,	we	specify	that	the	fields	must	be unique,	and	Django's	ORM	will	translate	this	into	a	requirement	for	the creation	of	the	necessary	unique	constraints	for	the	fields	in	the	underlying database	tables.  Now,	it	is	necessary	to	execute	the	migrations	that	will	generate	the	unique constraints	we	added	for	the	fields	in	the	models	in	the	database.	This time,	the	migrations	process	will	synchronize	the	database	with	the changes	we	made	in	the	models,	and	therefore,	the	process	will	apply	a delta.	Run	the	following	Python	script:  				python	manage.py	makemigrations	drones  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command:  Migrations	for	'drones': drones migrations 0002_auto_20171104_0246.py -	Alter	field	name	on	drone -	Alter	field	name	on	dronecategory -	Alter	field	name	on	pilot		  The	lines	in	the	output	indicate	that	the drones migrations 0002_auto_20171104_0246.py	file	includes	the	code	to	alter	the fields	called	name	on	drone,	dronecategory,	and	pilot.	It	is	important	to	take	into account	that	the	Python	filename	generated	by	the	migrations	process encodes	the	date	and	time,	and	therefore,	the	name	will	be	different	when you	run	the	code	in	your	development	computer.  The	following	lines	show	the	code	for	the	file	that	was	automatically generated	by	Django.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the   hillar_django_restful_07_01	folder,	in	the restful01 drones migrations 0002_auto_20171104_0246.py	file:  	-*-	coding:	utf-8	-*-	 	Generated	by	Django	1.11.5	on	2017-11-04	02:46	 from	__future__	import	unicode_literals	 	 from	django.db	import	migrations,	models	 	 	 class	Migration migrations.Migration :	 	 				dependencies	=	[	 								 'drones',	'0001_initial' ,	 				]	 	 				operations	=	[	 								migrations.AlterField 	 												model_name='drone',	 												name='name',	 												field=models.CharField max_length=250,	unique=True ,	 								 ,	 								migrations.AlterField 	 												model_name='dronecategory',	 												name='name',	 												field=models.CharField max_length=250,	unique=True ,	 								 ,	 								migrations.AlterField 	 												model_name='pilot',	 												name='name',	 												field=models.CharField max_length=50,	unique=True ,	 								 ,	 				]	  The	code	defines	a	subclass	of	the	django.db.migrations.Migration	class	called Migration,	which	defines	an	operations	list	with	many	migrations.AlterField instances.	Each	migrations.AlterField	instance	will	alter	the	field	in	the	table for	each	of	the	related	models:	drone,	dronecategory,	and	pilot.  Now,	run	the	following	Python	script	to	execute	all	the	generated migrations	and	apply	the	changes	in	the	underlying	database	tables:  				python	manage.py	migrate   The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command.	Notice	that	the	order	in	which	the	migrations	are	executed	can differ	in	your	development	computer:  				Operations	to	perform: 						Apply	all	migrations:	admin,	auth,	contenttypes,	drones,	sessions 				Running	migrations: 						Applying	drones.0002_auto_20171104_0246...	OK 		  After	we	run	the	previous	command,	we	will	have	unique	indexes	on	the name	fields	for	the	following	tables	in	the	PostgreSQL	database:  drones_drone  drones_dronecategory  drones_pilot  We	can	use	the	PostgreSQL	command-line	tools	or	any	other	application that	allows	us	to	easily	check	the	contents	of	the	PostgreSQL	database	to check	the	tables	that	Django	updated.	If	you	are	working	with	an	SQLite or	any	other	database	with	this	example,	make	sure	you	use	the	commands or	tools	related	to	the	database	you	are	using.  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	list	of	the	indexes	for	each	of	the previously	enumerated	tables	in	the	SQLPro	for	Postgres	GUI	tool.	Each table	has	a	new	unique	index	for	the	name	field:   The	following	are	the	names	generated	for	the	new	unique	indexes	in	the sample	database:  The	drones_drone_name_85faecee_uniq	index	for	the	drones_drone	table  The	drones_drone_dronecategory_name_dedead86_uniq	index	for	the drones_dronecategory	table  The	drones_pilot_name_3b56f2a1_uniq	index	for	the	drones_pilot	table   Working	with	unique constraints  Now,	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	understand	how	unique	constraints	work	when	applied to	our	models.	Execute	any	of	the	following	two	commands,	based	on your	needs,	to	access	the	API	in	other	devices	or	computers	connected	to your	LAN.	Remember	that	we	analyzed	the	difference	between	them	in	Cha pter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	in	the	Launching	Django's	development	server section:  				python	manage.py	runserver 				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000	  After	we	run	any	of	the	previous	commands,	the	development	server	will start	listening	at	port	8000.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	create	a	drone category	with	a	name	that	already	exists:	'Quadcopter',	as	shown	below:  				http	POST	:8000 drone-categories 	name="Quadcopter"  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  	curl	-iX	POST	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d		'{"name":"Quadcopter"}'	localhost:8000 drone-categories   Django	won't	be	able	to	persist	a	DroneCategory	instance	whose	name	is	equal to	the	specified	value	because	it	violates	the	unique	constraint	we	just added	to	the	name	field	for	the	DroneCategory	model.	As	a	result	of	the	request,   we	will	receive	a	400	Bad	Request	status	code	in	the	response	header	and	a message	related	to	the	value	specified	for	the	name	field	in	the	JSON	body: "drone	category	with	this	name	already	exists."	The	following	lines	show	the detailed	response:  				HTTP 1.0	400	Bad	Request 				Allow:	GET,	POST,	HEAD,	OPTIONS 				Content-Length:	58 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Sun,	05	Nov	2017	04:00:42	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"name":	[ 												"drone	category	with	this	name	already	exists." 								] 				}  We	made	the	necessary	changes	to	avoid	duplicate	values	for the	name	field	in	drone	categories,	drones,	or	pilots.	Whenever we	specify	the	name	for	any	of	these	resources,	we	will	be referencing	the	same	unique	resource,	because	duplicates aren't	possible.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	create	a	pilot	with	a name	that	already	exists:	'Penelope	Pitstop',	as	shown	below:  				http	POST	:8000 pilots 	name="Penelope	Pitstop"	gender="F"	 				races_count=0  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	POST	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d				 				'{"name":"Penelope	Pitstop",	"gender":"F",	"races_count":	0}'			 				localhost:8000 pilots    The	previous	command	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request	with the	specified	JSON	key-value	pairs.	The	request	specifies	 pilots ,	and therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^pilots $'	regular	expression	and	will	run	the post	method	for	the	views.PilotList	class-based	view.	Django	won't	be	able to	persist	a	Pilot	instance	whose	name	is	equal	to	the	specified	value	because it	violates	the	unique	constraint	we	just	added	to	the	name	field	for	the	Pilot model.	As	a	result	of	the	request,	we	will	receive	a	400	Bad	Request	status code	in	the	response	header	and	a	message	related	to	the	value	specified for	the	name	field	in	the	JSON	body:	"pilot	with	this	name	already	exists."	The following	lines	show	the	detailed	response:  				HTTP 1.0	400	Bad	Request 				Allow:	GET,	POST,	HEAD,	OPTIONS 				Content-Length:	49 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Sun,	05	Nov	2017	04:13:37	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"name":	[ 												"pilot	with	this	name	already	exists." 								] 				}  If	we	generate	the	HTTP	POST	request	with	the	help	of	the	HTML	form	in the	browsable	API,	we	will	see	the	error	message	displayed	below	the Name	field	in	the	form,	as	shown	in	the	next	screenshot:    Understanding	pagination  So	far,	we	have	been	working	with	a	database	that	has	just	a	few	rows,	and therefore,	the	HTTP	GET	requests	to	the	different	resource	collections	for our	RESTful	Web	Service	don't	have	problems	with	the	amount	of	data	in the	JSON	body	of	the	responses.	However,	this	situation	changes	as	the number	of	rows	in	the	database	tables	increases.  Let's	imagine	we	have	300	rows	in	the	drones_pilots	table	that	persists pilots.	We	don't	want	to	retrieve	the	data	for	300	pilots	whenever	we	make an	HTTP	GET	request	to	localhost:8000 pilots .	Instead,	we	just	take advantage	of	the	pagination	features	available	in	the	Django	REST framework	to	make	it	easy	to	specify	how	we	want	the	large	result	sets	to be	split	into	individual	pages	of	data.	This	way,	each	request	will	retrieve only	one	page	of	data,	instead	of	the	entire	result	set.	For	example,	we	can make	the	necessary	configurations	to	retrieve	only	the	data	for	a	page	of	a maximum	of	four	pilots.  Whenever	we	enable	a	pagination	scheme,	the	HTTP	GET	requests	must specify	the	pieces	of	data	that	they	want	to	retrieve,	that	is,	the	details	for the	specific	pages,	based	on	predefined	pagination	schemes.	In	addition,	it is	extremely	useful	to	have	data	about	the	total	number	of	resources,	the next	page,	and	the	previous	one,	in	the	response	body.	This	way,	the	user or	the	application	that	is	consuming	the	RESTful	Web	Service	knows	the additional	requests	that	need	to	be	made	to	retrieve	the	required	pages.  We	can	work	with	page	numbers	and	the	client	can	request	a	specific	page number	in	the	HTTP	GET	request.	Each	page	will	include	a	maximum amount	of	resources.	For	example,	if	we	request	the	first	page	for	the	300 pilots,	the	web	service	will	return	the	first	four	pilots	in	the	response	body. The	second	page	will	return	the	pilots	from	the	fifth	to	the	eighth	position in	the	response	body.   Another	option	is	to	specify	an	offset	combined	with	a	limit.	For	example, if	we	request	a	page	with	an	offset	equal	to	0	and	a	limit	of	4,	the	web service	will	return	the	first	four	pilots	in	the	response	body.	A	second request	with	an	offset	equal	to	4	and	a	limit	of	4	will	return	the	pilots	from the	fifth	to	the	eighth	position	in	the	response	body.  Right	now,	each	of	the	database	tables	that	persist	the	models	we	have defined	has	a	few	rows.	However,	after	we	start	working	with	our	web service	in	a	real-life	production	environment,	we	will	have	hundreds	of competitions,	pilots,	drones,	and	drone	categories.	Hence,	we	will definitely	have	to	deal	with	large	result	sets.	We	will	usually	have	the same	situation	in	most	RESTful	Web	Services,	and	therefore,	it	is	very important	to	work	with	pagination	mechanisms.   Configuring	pagination	classes  The	Django	REST	framework	provides	many	options	to	enable pagination.	First,	we	will	set	up	one	of	the	customizable	pagination	styles included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	to	include	a	maximum	of	four resources	in	each	individual	page	of	data.  Our	RESTful	Web	Service	uses	the	generic	views	that	work	with	mixin classes.	These	classes	are	prepared	to	build	paginated	responses	based	on specific	settings	in	the	Django	REST	framework	configuration.	Hence,	our RESTful	Web	Service	will	automatically	take	into	account	the	pagination settings	we	configured,	without	requiring	additional	changes	in	the	code.  Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares	module-level variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project. We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file.	The	code	file	for the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_01	folder,	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file.	Add	the	following	lines	that	declare	a dictionary	named	REST_FRAMEWORK	with	key-value	pairs	that	configure	the global	pagination	settings:  	REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{ 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 				'rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination', 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4 	}  Save	the	changes	and	Django's	development	server	will	recognize	the	edits and	start	again	with	the	new	pagination	settings	enabled.	The	new dictionary	has	two	string	keys:	'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS'	and	'PAGE_SIZE'.	The value	for	the	'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS'	key	specifies	a	global	setting	with	the default	pagination	class	that	the	generic	views	will	use	to	provide paginated	responses.	In	this	case,	we	will	use	the   rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination	class	that	provides	a limit offset-based	style.  This	pagination	style	works	with	a	limit	parameter	that	indicates	the maximum	number	of	items	to	return	and	an	offset	that	specifies	the starting	position	of	the	query.	The	value	for	the	PAGE_SIZE	settings	key specifies	a	global	setting	with	the	default	value	for	the	limit,	also	known	as the	page	size.	In	this	case,	the	value	is	set	to	4,	and	therefore,	the maximum	number	of	resources	returned	in	a	single	request	will	be	four. We	can	specify	a	different	limit	when	we	perform	the	HTTP	request	by specifying	the	desired	value	in	the	limit	query	parameter.	We	can	configure the	class	to	have	a	maximum	limit	value	in	order	to	avoid	undesired	huge result	sets.	This	way,	we	can	make	sure	that	the	user	won't	be	able	to specify	a	large	number	for	the	limit	value.	However,	we	will	make	this specific	configuration	later.

Working	with	customized pagination	classes  We	enabled	pagination	to	limit	the	size	for	the	result	sets.	However,	any client	or	user	is	able	to	specify	a	large	number	for	the	limit	value,	such	as 10000,	and	generate	a	huge	result	set.	In	order	to	specify	the	maximum number	that	is	accepted	for	the	limit	query	parameter,	it	is	necessary	to create	a	customized	version	of	the	limit offset	pagination	scheme	that	the Django	REST	framework	provides	us.  We	made	changes	to	the	global	configuration	to	use	the rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination	class	to	handle	paginated responses.	This	class	declares	a	max_limit	class	attribute	whose	default value	is	equal	to	None,	which	means	there	is	no	upper	bound	for	the	limit value.	We	will	indicate	the	upper	bound	value	for	the	limit	query parameter	in	the	max_limit	class	attribute.  Make	sure	you	quit	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you	just need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	Command	Prompt	in	which	it	is running.  Go	to	the	restful01 drones	folder	and	create	a	new	file	named custompagination.py.	Write	the	following	code	in	this	new	file.	The	following lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	declares	the	new LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_02	folder	in	the restful01 drones custompagination.py	file:  from	rest_framework.pagination	import	LimitOffsetPagination	 class	LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound LimitOffsetPagination : 					Set	the	maximum	limit	value	to	8	 							max_limit	=	8   The	previous	lines	declare	the	LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound	class	as	a subclass	of		rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination.	This	new	class overrides	the	value	assigned	to	the	max_limit	class	attribute	with	8.  Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	and	replace	the	line	that specifies	the	value	for	the	DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK dictionary	with	the	highlighted	line.	The	following	lines	show	the	new declaration	of	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_02	folder	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  	REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{	 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':	 				'drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound',	 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4	 	}	  This	way,	all	the	generic	views	will	use	the	recently	declared drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound	class	that	provides the	limit offset	pagination	scheme	we	have	analyzed	with	an	upper	bound for	the	limit	value	equal	to	8.  If	any	request	specifies	a	value	higher	than	8	for	the	limit,	the	class	will use	the	maximum	limit	value,	that	is,	8,	and	the	RESTful	Web	Service	will never	return	more	than	eight	resources	in	a	paginated	response.  It	is	a	good	practice	to	configure	a	maximum	limit	to	avoid generating	responses	with	huge	amounts	of	data	that	might generate	important	loads	to	the	server	running	the	RESTful Web	Service.	Note	that	we	will	learn	to	limit	the	usage	of	the resources	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service	in	the	forthcoming chapters.	Pagination	is	just	the	beginning	of	a	long	story.   Making	requests	that	use customized	paginated	results  Launch	Django's	development	server.	If	you	don't	remember	how	to	start Django's	development	server,	check	the	instructions	in	Chapter	3,	Creating API	Views,	in	the	Launching	Django's	development	server	section.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	retrieve	the	first page	for	the	drones	with	the	value	for	the	limit	query	parameter	set	to	500. This	value	is	higher	than	the	maximum	limit	we	established:  				http	GET	":8000 drones ?limit=500"		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	"localhost:8000 drones ?limit=500"  The	code	in	the	get	method	for	the	views.DroneList	class-based	view	will	use the	new	settings	we	added	to	enable	the	customized	offset limit pagination,	and	the	result	will	provide	us	with	the	first	eight	drone resources	because	the	maximum	value	for	the	limit	query	is	set	to	8.	The value	specified	for	the	limit	query	parameter	is	greater	than	8,	and therefore,	the	maximum	value	of	8	is	used,	instead	of	the	value	indicated	in the	request.  The	key	advantage	of	working	with	generic	views	is	that	we can	easily	customize	the	behavior	for	the	methods	defined	in the	mixins	that	compose	these	views	with	just	a	few	lines	of code.	In	this	case,	we	took	advantage	of	the	pagination features	available	in	the	Django	REST	framework	to	specify   how	we	wanted	large	results	sets	to	be	split	into	individual pages	of	data.	Then,	we	customized	paginated	results	with just	a	few	lines	of	code	to	make	the	limit offset	pagination scheme	match	our	specific	requirements.   Configuring	filter	backend classes  So	far,	we	have	been	working	with	the	entire	queryset	as	the	result	set.	For example,	whenever	we	requested	the	drones	resource	collection,	the RESTful	Web	Service	worked	with	the	entire	resource	collection	and	used the	default	sorting	we	had	configured	in	the	model.	Now,	we	want	our RESTful	Web	Service	to	be	able	to	provide	filtering,	searching,	and sorting	features.  It	is	very	important	to	understand	that	we	have	to	be	careful	with	the	fields we	configure	to	be	available	in	the	filtering,	searching,	and	ordering features.	The	configuration	will	have	an	impact	on	the	queries	executed	on the	database,	and	therefore,	we	must	make	sure	that	we	have	the appropriate	database	optimizations,	considering	the	queries	that	will	be executed.	Specific	database	optimizations	are	outside	of	the	scope	of	this book,	but	you	definitely	must	take	them	into	account	when	you	configure these	features.  Make	sure	you	quit	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you	just need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	Command	Prompt	window	in which	it	is	running.  Run	the	following	command	to	install	the	django-filter	package	in	our virtual	environment.	This	package	will	enable	us	to	use	many	field filtering	features	that	we	can	easily	customize	in	the	Django	REST framework.	Make	sure	the	virtual	environment	is	activated,	and	run	the following	command:  				pip	install	django-filter   The	last	lines	of	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	django-filter	package	has been	successfully	installed:  					Collecting	django-filter 					Downloading	django_filter-1.1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl 					Installing	collected	packages:	django-filter 					Successfully	installed	django-filter-1.1.0  We	will	work	with	the	following	three	classes:  rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter:	This	class	allows	the	client	to control	how	the	results	are	ordered	with	a	single	query	parameter. We	can	specify	which	fields	may	be	ordered	against.  django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend:	This	class	provides field	filtering	capabilities.	We	can	specify	the	set	of	fields	we	want to	be	able	to	filter	against,	and	the	filter	backend	defined	in	the django-filter	package	will	create	a	new django_filters.rest_framework.FilterSet	class	and	associate	it	to	the class-based	view.	It	is	also	possible	to	create	our	own rest_framework.filters.FilterSet	class,	with	more	customized	settings, and	write	our	own	code	to	associate	it	with	the	class-based	view.  rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter:	This	class	provides	single	query parameter-based	searching	capabilities,	and	its	behavior	is	based on	the	Django	admin's	search	function.	We	can	specify	the	set	of fields	we	want	to	include	for	the	search	feature	and	the	client	will be	able	to	filter	items	by	making	queries	that	search	on	these	fields with	a	single	query.	It	is	useful	when	we	want	to	make	it	possible for	a	request	to	search	on	multiple	fields	with	a	single	query.  It	is	possible	to	configure	the	filter	backends	by	including	any	of	the   previously	enumerated	classes	in	a	tuple	and	assigning	it	to	the filter_backends	class	attribute	for	the	generic	view	classes.	In	our	RESTful Web	Service,	we	want	all	our	class-based	views	to	use	the	same	filter backends,	and	therefore,	we	will	make	changes	in	the	global configuration.  Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares	module-level variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project. We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file.	Add	the highlighted	lines	that	declare	the	'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS'	key	and	assign	a tuple	of	strings	as	its	value	with	the	three	classes	we	have	analyzed.	The following	lines	show	the	new	declaration	of	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_03 folder	in	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  		REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{	 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':	 				'drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound',	 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4,	 				'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS':	  								'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',	 								'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',	 								'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',	 								 ,	 		}	  Locate	the	lines	that	assign	a	string	list	to	INSTALLED_APPS	to	declare	the installed	apps.	Add	the	following	string	to	the	INSTALLED_APPS	string	list	and save	the	changes	to	the	settings.py	file:  		'django_filters',  The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	that	declares	the	INSTALLED_APPS string	list	with	the	added	line	highlighted	and	with	comments	to understand	what	each	added	string	means.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:   		INSTALLED_APPS	=	[	 					'django.contrib.admin',	 					'django.contrib.auth',	 					'django.contrib.contenttypes',	 					'django.contrib.sessions',	 					'django.contrib.messages',	 					'django.contrib.staticfiles',	 						Django	REST	Framework	 					'rest_framework',	 						Drones	application	 					'drones.apps.DronesConfig',	 						Django	Filters,	 					'django_filters',	 	]  This	way,	we	have	added	the	django_filters	application	to	our	Django project	named	restful01.  The	default	query	parameter	names	are	search	for	the	search	feature	and ordering	for	the	ordering	feature.	We	can	specify	other	names	by	setting	the desired	strings	in	the	SEARCH_PARAM	and	the	ORDERING_PARAM	settings.	In	this	case, we	will	work	with	the	default	values.   Adding	filtering,	searching,	and ordering  Now,	we	will	add	the	necessary	code	to	configure	the	fields	that	we	want to	be	included	in	the	filtering,	searching,	and	ordering	features	for	each	of the	class-based	views	that	retrieve	the	contents	of	each	resource	collection. Hence,	we	will	make	changes	to	all	the	classes	with	the	List	suffix	in	the views.py	file:	DroneCategoryList,	DroneList,	PilotList,	and	CompetitionList.  We	will	declare	the	following	three	class	attributes	in	each	of	those classes:  filter_fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	strings	whose values	indicate	the	field	names	that	we	want	to	be	able	to	filter against.	Under	the	hood,	the	Django	REST	framework	will automatically	create	a	rest_framework.filters.FilterSet	class	and associate	it	to	the	class-based	view	in	which	we	are	declaring	the attribute.	We	will	be	able	to	filter	against	the	field	names	included in	the	tuple	of	strings.  search_fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	strings	whose values	indicate	the	text	type	field	names	that	we	want	to	include	in the	search	feature.	In	all	the	usages,	we	will	want	to	perform	a starts-with	match.	In	order	to	do	this,	we	will	include	'^'	as	a prefix	of	the	field	name	to	indicate	that	we	want	to	restrict	the search	behavior	to	a	starts-with	match.  ordering_fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	strings	whose values	indicate	the	field	names	that	the	HTTP	request	can	specify   to	sort	the	results.	If	the	request	doesn't	specify	a	field	for ordering,	the	response	will	use	the	default	ordering	fields	specified in	the	model	that	is	related	to	the	class-based	view.  Open	the	restful01 drones views.py	file.	Add	the	following	code	after	the	last line	that	declares	the	imports,	before	the	declaration	of	the	DroneCategoryList class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  from	rest_framework	import	filters	 from	django_filters	import	AllValuesFilter,	DateTimeFilter,	NumberFilter	  Add	the	following	highlighted	lines	to	the	DroneList	class	declared	in	the views.py	file.	The	next	lines	show	the	new	code	that	defines	the	class.	The code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneCategoryList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	DroneCategory.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneCategorySerializer	 				name	=	'dronecategory-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								 	  The	changes	in	the	DroneList	class	are	easy	to	understand.	We	will	be	able to	filter,	search,	and	order	by	the	name	field.  Add	the	following	highlighted	lines	to	the	DroneList	class	declared	in	the views.py	file.	The	next	lines	show	the	new	code	that	defines	the	class.	The   code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'drone_category',		 								'manufacturing_date',		 								'has_it_competed',		 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'manufacturing_date',	 								 	  In	the	DroneList	class,	we	specified	many	field	names	in	the	filter_fields attribute.	We	included	'drone_category'	in	the	string	tuple,	and	therefore,	we will	be	able	to	include	the	ID	values	for	this	field	in	the	filter.  We	will	take	advantage	of	other	options	for	related	models that	will	allow	us	to	filter	by	fields	of	the	related	model	later. This	way,	we	will	understand	the	different	customizations available.  The	ordering_fields	attribute	specifies	two	field	names	for	the	tuple	of strings,	and	therefore,	we	will	be	able	to	order	the	results	by	either	name	or manufacturing_date.	Don't	forget	that	we	must	take	into	account	database optimizations	when	enabling	fields	to	order	by.  Add	the	following	highlighted	lines	to	the	PilotList	class	declared	in	the views.py	file.	The	next	lines	show	the	new	code	that	defines	the	class.	The code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:   class	PilotList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'gender',	 								'races_count',	 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'races_count'	 								   The	ordering_fields	attribute	specifies	two	field	names	for	the	tuple	of strings,	and	therefore,	we	will	be	able	to	order	the	results	by	either	name	or races_count.   Working	with	different	types	of Django	filters  Now,	we	will	create	a	customized	filter	that	we	will	apply	to	the	Competition model.	We	will	code	the	new	CompetitionFilter	class,	specifically,	a	subclass of	the	rest_framework.filters.FilterSet	class.  Open	the	restful01 drones views.py	file.	Add	the	following	code	before	the declaration	of	the	CompetitionList	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder	in	the restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	CompetitionFilter filters.FilterSet :	 				from_achievement_date	=	DateTimeFilter 	 								name='distance_achievement_date',	lookup_expr='gte' 	 				to_achievement_date	=	DateTimeFilter 	 								name='distance_achievement_date',	lookup_expr='lte' 	 				min_distance_in_feet	=	NumberFilter 	 								name='distance_in_feet',	lookup_expr='gte' 	 				max_distance_in_feet	=	NumberFilter 	 								name='distance_in_feet',	lookup_expr='lte' 	 				drone_name	=	AllValuesFilter 	 								name='drone__name' 	 				pilot_name	=	AllValuesFilter 	 								name='pilot__name' 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Competition	 								fields	=	 	 												'distance_in_feet',	 												'from_achievement_date',	 												'to_achievement_date',	 												'min_distance_in_feet',	 												'max_distance_in_feet',	 													drone__name	will	be	accessed	as	drone_name	 												'drone_name',	 													pilot__name	will	be	accessed	as	pilot_name	 												'pilot_name',	   												   The	CompetitionFilter	class	declares	the	following	class	attributes:  from_achievement_date:	This	attribute	is	a	django_filters.DateTimeFilter instance	that	allows	the	request	to	filter	the	competitions	whose achievement_date	DateTime	value	is	greater	than	or	equal	to	the specified	DateTime	value.	The	value	specified	in	the	name argument	indicates	the	field	to	which	the	DateTime	filter	is applied,	'distance_achievement_date',	and	the	value	for	the	lookup_expr argument	indicates	the	lookup	expression,	'gte',	which	means greater	than	or	equal	to.  to_achievement_date:	This	attribute	is	a	django_filters.DateTimeFilter instance	that	allows	the	request	to	filter	the	competitions	whose achievement_date	DateTime	value	is	less	than	or	equal	to	the specified	DateTime	value.	The	value	specified	in	the	name argument	indicates	the	field	to	which	the	DateTime	filter	is applied,	'distance_achivement_date',	and	the	value	for	the	lookup_expr argument	indicates	the	lookup	expression,	'lte',	which	means	less than	or	equal	to.  min_distance_in_feet:	This	attribute	is	a	django_filters.NumberFilter instance	that	allows	the	request	to	filter	the	competitions	whose distance_in_feet	numeric	value	is	greater	than	or	equal	to	the specified	number.	The	value	for	the	name	argument	indicates	the field	to	which	the	numeric	filter	is	applied,	'distance_in_feet',	and the	value	for	the	lookup_expr	argument	indicates	the	lookup expression,	'gte',	which	means	greater	than	or	equal	to.  max_distance_in_feet:	This	attribute	is	a	django_filters.NumberFilter   instance	that	allows	the	request	to	filter	the	competitions	whose distance_in_feet	numeric	value	is	less	than	or	equal	to	the	specified number.	The	value	for	the	name	argument	indicates	the	field	to which	the	numeric	filter	is	applied,	'distance_in_feet',	and	the	value for	the	lookup_expr	argument	indicates	the	lookup	expression,	'lte', which	means	less	than	or	equal	to.  drone_name:	This	attribute	is	a	django_filters.AllValuesFilter	instance that	allows	the	request	to	filter	the	competitions	whose	drones' names	match	the	specified	string	value.	The	value	for	the	name argument	indicates	the	field	to	which	the	filter	is	applied, 'drone__name'.	Notice	that	there	is	a	double	underscore	 __ 	between drone	and	name,	and	you	can	read	it	as	the	name	field	for	the	drone model	or	simply	replace	the	double	underscore	with	a	dot	and	read drone.name.	The	name	uses	Django's	double	underscore	syntax. However,	we	don't	want	the	request	to	use	drone__name	to	specify	the filter	for	the	drone's	name.	Hence,	the	instance	is	stored	in	the class	attribute	named	drone_name,	with	just	a	single	underscore between	player	and	name,	to	make	it	more	user-friendly.	We	will make	configurations	to	make	the	browsable	API	display	a	drop- down	with	all	the	possible	values	for	the	drone's	name	to	use	as	a filter.	The	drop-down	will	only	include	the	drones'	names	that have	registered	competitions.  pilot_name:	This	attribute	is	a	django_filters.AllValuesFilter	instance that	allows	the	request	to	filter	the	competitions	whose	pilots' names	match	the	specified	string	value.	The	value	for	the	name argument	indicates	the	field	to	which	the	filter	is	applied, 'pilot__name'.	The	name	uses	Django's	double	underscore	syntax. As	happened	with	drone_name,	we	don't	want	the	request	to	use pilot__name	to	specify	the	filter	for	the	pilot's	name,	and	therefore,   we	stored	the	instance	in	the	class	attribute	named	pilot_name,	with just	a	single	underscore	between	pilot	and	name.	The	browsable	API will	display	a	drop-down	with	all	the	possible	values	for	the	pilot's name	to	use	as	a	filter.	The	drop-down	will	only	include	the	pilots' names	that	have	registered	competitions	because	we	used	the AllValuesFilter	class.  The	CompetitionFilter	class	defines	a	Meta	inner	class	that	declares	the following	two	attributes:  model:	This	attribute	specifies	the	model	related	to	the	filter	set,	that is,	the	Competition	class.  fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	strings	whose	values indicate	the	field	names	and	filter	names	that	we	want	to	include in	the	filters	for	the	related	model.	We	included	'distance_in_feet' and	the	names	for	all	the	previously	explained	filters.	The	string 'distance_in_feet'	refers	to	the	field	with	this	name.	We	want	to apply	the	default	numeric	filter	that	will	be	built	under	the	hood	to allow	the	request	to	filter	by	an	exact	match	on	the	distance_in_feet field.	This	way,	the	request	will	have	plenty	of	options	to	filter competitions.  Now,	add	the	following	highlighted	lines	to	the	CompetitionList	class declared	in	the	views.py	file.	The	next	lines	show	the	new	code	that	defines the	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_07_03	folder	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  		class	CompetitionList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Competition.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotCompetitionSerializer	 				name	=	'competition-list'	   				filter_class	=	CompetitionFilter	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'distance_in_feet',	 								'distance_achievement_date',	 								 	  The	filter_class	attribute	specifies	CompetitionFilter	as	its	value,	that	is,	the FilterSet	subclass	that	declares	the	customized	filters	that	we	want	to	use for	this	class-based	view.	In	this	case,	the	code	didn't	specify	a	tuple	of strings	for	the	filter_class	attribute	because	we	have	defined	our	own FilterSet	subclass.  The	ordering_fields	tuple	of	strings	specifies	the	two	field	names	that	the request	will	be	able	to	use	for	ordering	the	competitions.   Making	requests	that	filter results  Now	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	understand	how	to	use	the	previously	coded	filters. Execute	any	of	the	following	two	commands,	based	on	your	needs,	to access	the	API	in	other	devices	or	computers	connected	to	your	LAN. Remember	that	we	analyzed	the	difference	between	them	in	Chapter 3,	Creating	API	Views,	in	the	Launching	Django's	development	server section:  				python	manage.py	runserver 				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000  After	we	run	any	of	the	previous	commands,	the	development	server	will start	listening	at	port	8000.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	retrieve	all	the	drone categories	whose	name	is	equal	to	Quadcopter,	as	shown	below:  				http	":8000 drone-categories ?name=Quadcopter"		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	"localhost:8000 drone-categories ?name=Quadcopter"		  The	following	lines	show	a	sample	response	with	the	single	drone category	whose	name	matches	the	specified	name	string	in	the	filter	and	the list	of	hyperlinks	for	the	drones	that	belong	to	the	category.	The	following   lines	show	the	JSON	response	body	without	the	headers.	Notice	that	the results	are	paginated:  				{ 								"count":	1,	 								"next":	null,	 								"previous":	null,	 								"results":	[ 												{ 																"drones":	[ 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 2",	 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 9",	 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 5",	 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 7",	 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 3",	 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 11",	 																				"http:  localhost:8000 drones 1" 																],	 																"name":	"Quadcopter",	 																"pk":	1,	 																"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drone-categories 1" 												} 								] 				}		   Composing	requests	that	filter and	order	results  We	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	retrieve	all	the	drones whose	related	drone	category	ID	is	equal	to	1	and	whose	value	for	the has_it_competed	field	is	equal	to	False.	The	results	must	be	sorted	by	name	in descending	order,	and	therefore,	we	specify	-name	as	the	value	for	the ordering	query	parameter.  The	hyphen	 - 	before	the	field	name	indicates	that	the ordering	feature	must	use	descending	order	instead	of	the default	ascending	order.  Make	sure	you	replace	1	with	the	pk	value	of	the	previously	retrieved	drone category	named	Quadcopter.	The	has_it_competed	field	is	a	bool	field,	and therefore,	we	have	to	use	Python	valid	bool	values	 True	and	False 	when specifying	the	desired	values	for	the	bool	field	in	the	filter:  				http	":8000 drones ? 				drone_category=1&has_it_competed=False&ordering=-name"  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	"localhost:8000 drones ? 				drone_category=1&has_it_competed=False&ordering=-name"	  The	following	lines	show	a	sample	response	with	the	first	four	out	of seven	drones	that	match	the	specified	criteria	in	the	filter,	sorted	by	name in	descending	order.	Notice	that	the	filters	and	the	ordering	have	been combined	with	the	previously	configured	pagination.	The	following	lines show	only	the	JSON	response	body,	without	the	headers:   				{ 								"count":	7,	 								"next":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones ?	 									 					drone_category=1&has_it_competed=False&limit=4&offset=4&ordering=- 					name",	 								"previous":	null,	 								"results":	[ 												{ 																"drone_category":	"Quadcopter",	 																"has_it_competed":	false,	 																"inserted_timestamp":	"2017-11-03T01:58:49.135737Z",	 																"manufacturing_date":	"2017-07-20T02:02:00.716312Z",	 																"name":	"WonderDrone",	 																"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones 1" 												},	 												{ 																"drone_category":	"Quadcopter",	 																"has_it_competed":	false,	 																"inserted_timestamp":	"2017-11-06T20:25:31.511881Z",	 																"manufacturing_date":	"2017-09-20T02:02:00.716312Z",	 																"name":	"Skipper",	 																"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones 11" 												},	 												{ 																"drone_category":	"Quadcopter",	 																"has_it_competed":	false,	 																"inserted_timestamp":	"2017-11-06T20:25:29.636153Z",	 																"manufacturing_date":	"2017-01-20T02:02:00.716312Z",	 																"name":	"Need	for	Speed",	 																"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones 3" 												},	 												{ 																"drone_category":	"Quadcopter",	 																"has_it_competed":	false,	 																"inserted_timestamp":	"2017-11-06T20:25:30.584031Z",	 																"manufacturing_date":	"2017-05-20T02:02:00.716312Z",	 																"name":	"Gulfstream	I",	 																"url":	"http:  localhost:8000 drones 7" 												} 								] 				}  Notice	that	the	response	provides	the	value	for	the	next	key, http:  localhost:8000 drones ? drone_category=1&has_it_competed=False&limit=4&offset=4&ordering=- name.	This	URL	includes	the	combination	of	pagination,   filtering,	and	ordering	query	parameters.  In	the	DroneList	class,	we	included	'drone_category'	as	one	of	the	strings	in the	filter_fields	tuple	of	strings.	Hence,	we	had	to	use	the	drone	category ID	in	the	filter.  Now,	we	will	use	a	filter	on	the	drone's	name	related	to	a	competition.	As previously	explained,	our	CompetitionFilter	class	provides	us	a	filter	to	the name	of	the	related	drone	in	the	drone_name	query	parameter.  We	will	combine	the	filter	with	another	filter	on	the	pilot's	name	related	to a	competition.	Remember	that	the	class	also	provides	us	a	filter	to	the name	of	the	related	pilot	in	the	pilot_name	query	parameter.	We	will	specify two	conditions	in	the	criteria,	and	the	filters	are	combined	with	the	AND operator.	Hence,	both	conditions	must	be	met.

In	addition,	we	want	the results	ordered	by	distance_achievement_date,	in	descending	order:  1.	 The	distance_achievement_date	is	between	2017-10-18	and	2017-10-21 2.	 The	distance_in_feet	value	is	between	700	and	900  The	following	command	will	do	the	job:  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  The	previously	analyzed	CompetitionFilter	class	allowed	us	to	create	a request	like	the	previous	one,	in	which	we	take	advantage	of	the customized	filters.	The	following	lines	show	a	sample	response	with	the two	competitions	that	match	the	specified	criteria	in	the	filters.	We overrode	the	default	ordering	specified	in	the	model	with	the	ordering	field indicated	in	the	request.

All	of	these	new	features	have	an impact	on	how	each	web	page	is	rendered	when	working	with	the browsable	API.  We	can	work	with	a	web	browser	to	easily	test	pagination,	filtering, searching,	and	ordering	with	a	few	clicks	or	taps.  Open	a	web	browser	and	go	to	http:  localhost:8000 drones .	Replace localhost	with	the	IP	of	the	computer	that	is	running	Django's	development server	if	you	use	another	computer	or	device	to	run	the	browser.	The browsable	API	will	compose	and	send	a	GET	request	to	 drones 	and	will display	the	results	of	its	execution,	that	is,	the	headers	and	the	JSON drones	list.  We	have	configured	pagination,	and	therefore,	the	rendered	web	page	will include	the	default	pagination	template	associated	with	the	base	pagination class	we	are	using	and	will	display	the	available	page	numbers	in	the upper-right	corner	of	the	web	page.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the rendered	web	page	after	entering	the	URL	in	a	web	browser	with	the resource	description,	Drone	List,	and	the	three	pages	generated	with	the limit offset	pagination	scheme:   Now,	go	to	http:  localhost:8000 competitions .	The	browsable	API	will compose	and	send	a	GET	request	to	 competitions 	and	will	display	the	results of	its	execution,	that	is,	the	headers	and	the	JSON	competitions	list.	The web	page	will	include	a	Filters	button	at	the	right-hand	side	of	the resource	description,	Competition	List,	and	at	the	left-hand	side	of	the OPTIONS	button.  Click	or	tap	on	Filters,	and	the	browsable	API	will	render	the	Filter	model with	the	appropriate	controls	for	each	filter	that	you	can	apply	below	Field Filters.	In	addition,	the	model	will	render	the	different	ordering	options below	Ordering.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	Filters	model	for	the competitions:   The	Drone	name	and	Pilot	name	drop-downs	only	provide	the	related drones'	names	and	pilots'	names	that	have	participated	in	competitions because	we	used	the	AllValuesFilter	class	for	both	filters.	We	can	easily enter	all	the	values	for	each	desired	filter	that	we	want	to	apply	and	click or	tap	Submit.	Then,	click	on	Filters	again,	select	the	ordering	option,	and click	Submit.	The	browsable	API	will	compose	and	send	the	necessary HTTP	request	to	apply	the	filters	and	ordering	we	have	specified	and	it will	render	a	web	page	with	the	first	page	of	the	results	of	the	execution	of the	request.  The	next	screenshot	shows	the	results	of	executing	a	request	whose	filters were	composed	with	the	previously	explained	model:   The	following	are	the	parameters	for	the	HTTP	GET	request.	Notice	that	the browsable	API	generates	the	query	parameters	but	doesn't	specify	values for	the	filters	that	were	left	without	values	in	the	previous	modal.	When the	query	parameters	don't	specify	values,	they	are	ignored:  As	happens	whenever	we	have	to	test	the	different	features	included	in	our RESTful	Web	Service,	the	browsable	API	is	also	extremely	helpful whenever	we	need	to	check	filters	and	ordering.  http:  localhost:8000 competitions ?distance_in_feet=&drone_name=Atom&format=json&from_achievement_date=&max_distance_in_feet=&min_distance_in_feet=85&pilot_name=Penelope+Pitstop&to_achievement_date=	   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly:  1.

Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	used	the	browsable	API	feature	to	navigate	through	the API	with	resources	and	relationships.	We	added	unique	constraints	to improve	consistency	for	the	models	in	our	RESTful	Web	Service.  We	understood	the	importance	of	paginating	results	and	we	configured and	tested	a	global	limit offset	pagination	scheme	with	the	Django	REST framework.	Then,	we	created	our	own	customized	pagination	class	to make	sure	that	requests	weren't	able	to	acquire	a	huge	amount	of	elements in	a	single	page.  We	configured	filter	backend	classes	and	we	added	code	to	the	models	to add	filtering,	searching,	and	ordering	capabilities	to	the	class-based	views. We	created	a	customized	filter	and	we	made	requests	to	filter,	search,	and order	results,	and	we	understood	how	everything	worked	under	the	hood. Finally,	we	used	the	browsable	API	to	test	pagination,	filtering,	and ordering.  Now	that	we	improved	our	RESTful	Web	Service	with	unique	constraints, paginated	results,	fitering,	searching,	and	ordering	features,	we	will	secure the	API	with	authentication	and	permissions.	We	will	cover	these	topics	in the	next	chapter.   Securing	the	API	with Authentication	and Permissions  In	this	chapter,	we	will	understand	the	difference	between	authentication and	permissions	in	the	Django	REST	framework.	We	will	start	securing our	RESTful	Web	Service	by	adding	requirements	for	authentication schemes	and	specifying	permission	policies.	We	will	gain	an understanding	of:  Understanding	authentication	and	permissions	in	Django,	the Django	REST	framework,	and	RESTful	Web	Services  Authentication	classes  Security	and	permissions-related	data	to	models  Working	with	object-level	permissions	via	customized	permission classes  Saving	information	about	users	that	make	requests  Setting	permissions	policies  Creating	the	superuser	for	Django  Creating	a	user	for	Django  Making	authenticated	requests  Browsing	the	secured	API	with	the	required	authentication   Working	with	token-based	authentication  Generating	and	using	tokens   Understanding	authentication and	permissions	in	Django,	the Django	REST	framework,	and RESTful	Web	Services  Right	now,	our	sample	RESTful	Web	Service	processes	all	the	incoming requests	without	requiring	any	kind	of	authentication,	that	is,	any	user	can perform	requests.	The	Django	REST	framework	allows	us	to	easily	use diverse	authentication	schemes	to	identify	a	user	that	originated	the request	or	a	token	that	signed	the	request.	Then,	we	can	use	these credentials	to	apply	permission	and	throttling	policies	that	will	determine whether	the	request	must	be	permitted	or	not.  We	already	know	how	configurations	work	with	the	Django	REST framework.	We	can	apply	a	global	setting	and	override	it	if	necessary	in the	appropriate	class-based	views.	Hence,	we	can	set	the	default authentication	schemes	in	the	global	settings	and	override	them	whenever required	for	specific	scenarios.  The	settings	allow	us	to	declare	a	list	of	classes	that	specify	the authentication	schemes	to	be	used	for	all	the	incoming	HTTP	requests. The	Django	REST	framework	will	use	all	the	specified	classes	in	the	list to	authenticate	a	request,	before	running	the	appropriate	method	for	the class-based	view	based	on	the	request.  We	can	specify	just	one	class.	However,	it	is	very	important	to	understand the	behavior	in	case	we	have	to	use	more	than	one	class.	The	first	class	in the	list	that	generates	a	successful	authentication	will	be	responsible	for setting	the	values	for	the	following	two	attributes	for	the	request	object:   user:	This	attribute	represents	the	user	model	instance.	In	our examples,	we	will	work	with	an	instance	of	the	Django	User	class, specifically,	the	django.contrib.auth.User	class.  auth:	This	attribute	provides	additional	authentication	data	required by	the	authentication	scheme,	such	as	an	authentication	token.  After	a	successful	authentication,	we	will	be	able	to	use	the	request.user attribute	within	the	different	methods	in	our	class-based	views	that	receive the	request	parameter.	This	way,	we	will	be	able	to	retrieve	additional information	about	the	user	that	generated	the	request.   Learning	about	the authentication	classes  The	Django	REST	framework	provides	the	following	three	authentication classes	in	the	rest_framework.authentication	module.	All	of	them	are subclasses	of	the	BaseAuthentication	class:  BasicAuthentication:	This	class	provides	an	HTTP	basic authentication	against	a	username	and	a	password.  SessionAuthentication:	This	class	works	with	Django's	session framework	for	authentication.  TokenAuthentication:	This	class	provides	a	simple	token-based authentication.	The	request	must	include	the	token	generated	for	a user	as	the	value	for	the	Authorization	HTTP	header	key	with	the 'Token	'	string	as	a	prefix	for	the	token.  Of	course,	in	a	production	environment,	we	must	make	sure that	the	RESTful	Web	Service	is	only	available	over	HTTPS, with	the	usage	of	the	latest	TLS	versions.	We	shouldn't	use	an HTTP	basic	authentication	or	a	simple	token-based authentication	over	plain	HTTP	in	a	production	environment. The	previous	classes	are	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	out	of the	box.	There	are	many	additional	authentication	classes	provided	by many	third-party	libraries.	We	will	work	with	some	of	these	libraries	later in	this	chapter.  Make	sure	you	quit	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you	just need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	go	to	the	Command	Prompt   window	in	which	it	is	running.	We	have	to	edit	the	models	and	then execute	migrations	before	starting	Django's	development	server	again.  We	will	make	the	necessary	changes	to	combine	HTTP	basic authentication	against	a	username	and	a	password	with	Django's	session framework	for	authentication.	Hence,	we	will	add	the	BasicAuthentication and	SessionAuthentication	classes	in	the	global	authentication	classes	list.  Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares	the	module-level variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project. We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file.	Add	the highlighted	lines	to	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	following	lines	show the	new	declaration	of	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	code	file	for	the sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{	 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':	 				'drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound',	 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4,	 				'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS':	 	 								'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',	 								'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',	 								'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES':	  								'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',	 								'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',	 								  }	  We	added	the	DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES	settings	key	to	the	REST_FRAMEWORK dictionary.	This	new	key	specifies	a	global	setting	with	a	tuple	of	string whose	values	indicate	the	classes	that	we	want	to	use	for	authentication: BasicAuthentication	and	SessionAuthentication.   Including	security	and permissions-related	data	to models  We	want	each	drone	to	have	an	owner.	Only	an	authenticated	user	will	be able	to	create	a	drone	and	it	will	automatically	become	the	owner	of	this new	drone.	We	want	only	the	owner	of	a	drone	to	be	able	to	update	or delete	the	drone.	Hence,	an	authenticated	user	that	is	also	the	owner	of	the drone	will	be	able	to	execute	PATCH,	PUT,	and	DELETE	methods	on	the	drone resource	that	he	owns.  Any	authenticated	user	that	isn't	the	owner	of	a	specific	drone	resource will	have	read-only	access	to	this	drone.	In	addition,	unauthenticated requests	will	also	have	read-only	access	to	drones.  We	will	combine	authentication	with	specific	permissions.	Permissions use	the	authentication	information	included	in	the	request.user	and request.auth	attributes	to	determine	whether	the	request	should	be	granted or	denied	access.	Permissions	allow	us	to	control	which	types	of	users	will be	granted	or	denied	access	to	the	different	features,	methods,	resources, or	resource	collections	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service.  We	will	use	the	permissions	features	in	the	Django	REST	framework	to allow	only	authenticated	users	to	create	new	drones	and	automatically become	their	owners.	We	will	make	the	necessary	changes	in	the	models to	make	a	drone	have	a	user	as	its	owner.	We	will	take	advantage	of	the out-of-the-box	permission	classes	included	in	the	framework	combined with	a	customized	permission	class,	to	define	the	previously	explained permission	policies	for	the	drones	and	their	related	HTTP	verbs	supported in	our	web	service.   In	this	case,	we	will	stay	focused	on	security	and	permissions	and	we	will leave	throttling	rules	for	the	next	chapters.	Bear	in	mind	that	throttling rules	also	determine	whether	a	specific	request	must	be	authorized	or	not. However,	we	will	work	on	throttling	rules	later	and	we	will	combine	them with	authentication	and	permissions.  Open	the	restful01 drones models.py	file	and	replace	the	code	that	declares	the Drone	class	with	the	following	code.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the code	listing.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones models.py	file:  class	Drone models.Model :	 				name	=	models.CharField max_length=250,	unique=True 	 				drone_category	=	models.ForeignKey 	 								DroneCategory,		 								related_name='drones',		 								on_delete=models.CASCADE 	 				manufacturing_date	=	models.DateTimeField  	 				has_it_competed	=	models.BooleanField default=False 	 				inserted_timestamp	=	models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True 	 				owner	=	models.ForeignKey 	 								'auth.User',		 								related_name='drones',	 								on_delete=models.CASCADE 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								ordering	=	 'name', 	 	 				def	__str__ self :	 								return	self.name  The	highlighted	lines	declare	a	new	owner	field	for	the	Drone	model.	The new	field	uses	the	django.db.models.ForeignKey	class	to	provide	a	many-to-one relationship	to	the	django.contrib.auth.User	model.  This	User	model	persists	the	users	for	the	Django	authentication	system. Now,	we	are	using	this	authentication	system	for	our	RESTful	Web Service.	The	'drones'	value	specified	for	the	related_name	argument	creates	a backward	relation	from	the	User	to	the	Drone	model.	Remember	that	this value	indicates	the	name	to	use	for	the	relation	from	the	related	User	object   back	to	a	Drone	object.	This	way,	we	will	be	able	to	access	all	the	drones owned	by	a	specific	user.  Whenever	we	delete	a	User,	we	want	all	drones	owned	by	this	user	to	be deleted	too,	and	therefore,	we	specified	the	models.CASCADE	value	for	the on_delete	argument.  Open	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file	and	add	the	following	code	after the	last	line	that	declares	the	imports,	before	the	declaration	of	the DroneCategorySerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file:  from	django.contrib.auth.models	import	User	 	 	 class	UserDroneSerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer :	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Drone	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',	 												'name' 	 	 	 class	UserSerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer :	 				drones	=	UserDroneSerializer 	 								many=True,		 								read_only=True 	 	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	User	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',		 												'pk',	 												'username',	 												'drone'   We	don't	want	to	use	the	DroneSerializer	serializer	class	for	the	drones related	to	a	user	because	we	want	to	serialize	fewer	fields,	and	therefore, we	created	the	UserDroneSerializer	class.	This	class	is	a	subclass	of	the HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class.	This	new	serializer	allows	us	to	serialize	the drones	related	to	a	User.	The	UserDroneSerializer	class	defines	a	Meta	inner   class	that	declares	the	following	two	attributes:  model:	This	attribute	specifies	the	model	related	to	the	serializer, that	is,	the	Drone	class.  fields:	This	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	of	string	whose	values indicate	the	field	names	that	we	want	to	include	in	the	serialization from	the	related	model.	We	just	want	to	include	the	URL	and	the drone's	name,	and	therefore,	the	code	includes	'url'	and	'name'	as members	of	the	tuple.  The	UserSerializer	is	a	subclass	of	the	HyperlinkedModelSerializer	class.	This new	serializer	class	declares	a	drones	attribute	as	an	instance	of	the previously	explained	UserDroneSerializer	class,	with	the	many	and	read_only arguments	equal	to	True	because	it	is	a	one-to-many	relationship	and	it	is read-only.	The	code	specifies	the	drones	name	that	we	specified	as	the string	value	for	the	related_name	argument	when	we	added	the	owner	field	as	a models.ForeignKey	instance	in	the	Drone	model.	This	way,	the	drones	field	will provide	us	with	an	array	of	URLs	and	names	for	each	drone	that	belongs to	the	user.  Now,	we	will	add	an	owner	field	to	the	existing	DroneSerializer	class.	Open the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file	and	replace	the	code	that	declares	the DroneSerializer	class	with	the	following	code.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted in	the	code	listing.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones serializers.py	file.  class	DroneSerializer serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer :	 					Display	the	category	name	 				drone_category	=	serializers.SlugRelatedField queryset=DroneCategory.objects.all  ,	slug_field='name' 	 					Display	the	owner's	username	 read-only 	 				owner	=	serializers.ReadOnlyField source='owner.username'  	 				class	Meta:	 								model	=	Drone	 								fields	=	 	 												'url',	   												'name',	 												'drone_category',	 												'owner', 												'manufacturing_date',	 												'has_it_competed',	 												'inserted_timestamp', 	  The	new	version	of	the	DroneSerializer	class	declares	an	owner	attribute	as	an instance	of	serializers.ReadOnlyField	with	the	source	argument	equal	to 'owner.username'.	This	way,	the	serializer	will	serialize	the	value	for	the username	field	of	the	related	django.contrib.auth.User	instance	stored	in	the owner	field.  The	code	uses	the	ReadOnlyField	class	because	the	owner	is	automatically populated	when	an	authenticated	user	creates	a	new	drone.	It	will	be impossible	to	change	the	owner	after	a	drone	has	been	created	with	an HTTP	POST	method	call.	This	way,	the	owner	field	will	render	the	username that	created	the	related	drone.	In	addition,	we	added	'owner'	to	the	fields string	tuple	within	the	Meta	inner	class.  We	made	the	necessary	changes	to	the	Drone	model	and	its	serializer	 the DroneSerializer	class 	to	make	drones	have	owners.   Working	with	object-level permissions	via	customized permission	classes  The	rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission	class	is	the	base	class	from which	all	customized	permission	classes	should	inherit	to	work	with	the Django	REST	framework.	We	want	to	make	sure	that	only	a	drone	owner can	update	or	delete	an	existing	drone.  Go	to	the	restful01 drones	folder	and	create	a	new	file	named custompermission.py.	Write	the	following	code	in	this	new	file.	The	following lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	declares	the	new IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly	class	declared	as	a	subclass	of	the	BasePermission class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones custompermission.py	file:  from	rest_framework	import	permissions	 	 	 class	IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly permissions.BasePermission :	 				def	has_object_permission self,	request,	view,	obj :	 								if	request.method	in	permissions.SAFE_METHODS:	 													The	method	is	a	safe	method	 												return	True	 								else:	 													The	method	isn't	a	safe	method	 													Only	owners	are	granted	permissions	for	unsafe	methods	 												return	obj.owner	==	request.user	  The	previous	lines	declare	the	IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly	class	and	override the	has_object_permission	method	defined	in	the	BasePermission	superclass	that returns	a	bool	value	indicating	whether	the	permission	should	be	granted	or not.   The	permissions.SAFE_METHODS	tuple	of	string	includes	the	three	HTTP	methods or	verbs	that	are	considered	safe	because	they	are	read-only	and	they	don't produce	changes	to	the	related	resource	or	resource	collection:	'GET',	'HEAD', and	'OPTIONS'.	The	code	in	the	has_object_permission	method	checks	whether the	HTTP	verb	specified	in	the	request.method	attribute	is	any	of	the	three safe	methods	specified	in	permission.SAFE_METHODS.	If	this	expression evaluates	to	True,	the	has_object_permission	method	returns	True	and	grants permission	to	the	request.  If	the	HTTP	verb	specified	in	the	request.method	attribute	is	not	any	of	the three	safe	methods,	the	code	returns	True	and	grants	permission	only	when the	owner	attribute	of	the	received	obj	object	 obj.owner 	matches	the	user	that originated	the	request	 request.user .	The	user	that	originated	the	request will	always	be	the	authenticated	user.	This	way,	only	the	owner	of	the related	resource	will	be	granted	permission	for	those	requests	that	include HTTP	verbs	that	aren't	safe.  We	will	use	the	new	IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly	customized	permission class	to	make	sure	that	only	the	drone	owners	can	make	changes	to	an existing	drone.	We	will	combine	this	permission	class	with	the rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly	one	that	only	allows	read- only	access	to	resources	when	the	request	doesn't	belong	to	an authenticated	user.	This	way,	whenever	an	anonymous	user	performs	a request,	he	will	only	have	read-only	access	to	the	resources.   Saving	information	about	users that	make	requests  Whenever	a	user	performs	an	HTTP	POST	request	to	the	drone	resource collection	to	create	a	new	drone	resource,	we	want	to	make	the authenticated	user	that	makes	the	request	the	owner	of	the	new	drone.	In order	to	make	this	happen,	we	will	override	the	perform_create	method	in	the DroneList	class	declared	in	the	views.py	file.  Open	the	restful01 drones views.py	file	and	replace	the	code	that	declares	the DroneList	class	with	the	following	code.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in the	code	listing.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'drone_category',		 								'manufacturing_date',		 								'has_it_competed',		 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'manufacturing_date',	 								 	 	 				def	perform_create self,	serializer :	 								serializer.save owner=self.request.user 	  The	generics.ListCreateAPIView	class	inherits	from	the	CreateModelMixin	class   and	other	classes.	The	DroneList	class	inherits	the	perform_create	method	from the	rest_framework.mixins.CreateModelMixin	class.  The	code	that	overrides	the	perform_create	method	provides	an	additional owner	field	to	the	create	method	by	setting	a	value	for	the	owner	argument	in the	call	to	the	serializer.save	method.	The	code	sets	the	owner	argument	to the	value	of	self.request.user,	that	is,	to	the	authenticated	user	that	is making	the	request.	This	way,	whenever	a	new	Drone	is	created	and persisted,	it	will	save	the	User	associated	to	the	request	as	its	owner.   Setting	permission	policies  We	will	configure	permission	policies	for	the	class-based	views	that	work with	the	Drone	model.	We	will	override	the	value	for	the	permission_classes class	attribute	for	the	DroneDetail	and	DroneList	classes.  We	will	add	the	same	lines	of	code	in	the	two	classes.	We	will	include	the IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly	class	and	our	recently	declared IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly	permission	class	in	the	permission_classes	tuple.  Open	the	restful01 drones views.py	file	and	add	the	following	lines	after	the last	line	that	declares	the	imports,	before	the	declaration	of	the DroneCategorySerializer	class:  from	rest_framework	import	permissions	 from	drones	import	custompermission	  Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	DroneDetail	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-detail'	 				permission_classes	=	 	 								permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,	 								custompermission.IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly,	 								   Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	DroneList	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing.   The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'drone_category',		 								'manufacturing_date',		 								'has_it_competed',		 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'manufacturing_date',	 								 	 				permission_classes	=	 	 								permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,	 								custompermission.IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly,	 								  	 				def	perform_create self,	serializer :	 								serializer.save owner=self.request.user 	   Creating	the	superuser	for Django  Now,	we	will	run	the	necessary	command	to	create	the	superuser	for	Django that	will	allow	us	to	authenticate	our	requests.	We	will	create	other	users later.  Make	sure	you	are	in	the	restful01	folder	that	includes	the	manage.py	file	in the	activated	virtual	environment.	Execute	the	following	command	that executes	the	createsuperuser	subcommand	for	the	manage.py	script	to	allow	us to	create	the	superuser:  				python	manage.py	createsuperuser  The	command	will	ask	you	for	the	username	you	want	to	use	for	the superuser.	Enter	the	desired	username	and	press	Enter.	We	will	use djangosuper	as	the	username	for	this	example.	You	will	see	a	line	similar	to the	following	one:  				Username	 leave	blank	to	use	'gaston' :  Then,	the	command	will	ask	you	for	the	email	address.	Enter	an	email address	and	press	Enter.	You	can	enter	djangosuper@example.com:  				Email	address:  Finally,	the	command	will	ask	you	for	the	password	for	the	new	superuser. Enter	your	desired	password	and	press	Enter.	We	will	use	passwordforsuper as	an	example	in	our	tests.	Of	course,	this	password	is	not	the	best   example	of	a	strong	password.	However,	the	password	is	easy	to	type	and read	in	our	tests:  				Password:  The	command	will	ask	you	to	enter	the	password	again.	Enter	it	and	press Enter.	If	both	entered	passwords	match,	the	superuser	will	be	created:  				Password	 again :	 				Superuser	created	successfully.  Our	database	has	many	rows	in	the	drones_drone	table.	We	added	a	new	owner field	for	the	Drone	model	and	this	required	field	will	be	added	to	the drones_drone	table	after	we	execute	migrations.	We	have	to	assign	a	default owner	for	all	the	existing	drones	to	make	it	possible	to	add	this	new required	field	without	having	to	delete	all	these	drones.	We	will	use	one	of the	features	included	in	Django	to	solve	the	issue.  First,	we	have	to	know	the	id	value	for	the	superuser	we	have	created	to use	it	as	the	default	owner	for	the	existing	drones.	Then,	we	will	use	this value	to	let	Django	know	which	is	the	default	owner	for	the	existing drones.  We	created	the	first	user,	and	therefore,	the	id	will	be	equal	to	1.	However, we	will	check	the	procedure	to	determine	the	id	value	in	case	you	create other	users	and	you	want	to	assign	any	other	user	as	the	default	owner.  You	can	check	the	row	in	the	auth_user	table	whose	username	field	matches 'djangosuper'	in	any	tool	that	works	with	PostgreSQL.	Another	option	is	to run	the	following	commands	to	retrieve	the	ID	from	the	auth_user	table for	the	row	whose	username	is	equal	to	'djangosuper'.	In	case	you	specified a	different	name,	make	sure	you	use	the	appropriate	one.	In	addition, replace	the	username	in	the	command	with	the	username	you	used	to create	the	PostgreSQL	database	and	password	with	your	chosen	password for	this	database	user.	You	specified	this	information	when	you	executed   the	steps	explained	in	Chapter	6,	Working	with	Advanced	Relationships	and Serialization,	in	the	Running	migrations	that	generate	relationships section.  The	command	assumes	that	you	are	running	PostgreSQL	on	the	same computer	in	which	you	are	executing	the	command:  				psql	--username=username	--dbname=drones	--command="SELECT	id	FROM	 				auth_user	WHERE	username	=	'djangosuper';" 		  The	following	lines	show	the	output	with	the	value	for	the	id	field:	1:  				id	 				---- 						1 				 1	row   Now,	run	the	following	Python	script	to	generate	the	migrations	that	will allow	us	to	synchronize	the	database	with	the	new	field	we	added	to	the Drone	model:  				python	manage.py	makemigrations	drones  Django	will	explain	to	us	that	we	cannot	add	a	non-nullable	field	without	a default	and	will	ask	us	to	select	an	option	with	the	following	message:  	You	are	trying	to	add	a	non-nullable	field	'owner'	to	drone	without	a			 		default;	we	can't	do	that	 the	database	needs	something	to	populate	 			existing	rows . 				Please	select	a	fix: 					1 	Provide	a	one-off	default	now	 will	be	set	on	all	existing	rows	 					with	a	null	value	for	this	column  					2 	Quit,	and	let	me	add	a	default	in	models.py 							Select	an	option:   Enter	1	and	press	Enter.	This	way,	we	will	select	the	first	option	to	provide the	one-off	default	that	will	be	set	on	all	the	existing	drones_drone	rows.  Django	will	ask	us	to	provide	the	default	value	we	want	to	set	for	the	owner field	of	the	drones_drone	table:  				Please	enter	the	default	value	now,	as	valid	Python 				The	datetime	and	django.utils.timezone	modules	are	available,	so	 					you	can	do	e.g.	timezone.now 				Type	'exit'	to	exit	this	prompt 				>>>  Enter	the	value	for	the	previously	retrieved	id:	1.	Then,	press	Enter.	The following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command:  				Migrations	for	'drones': 						drones migrations 0003_drone_owner.py 								-	Add	field	owner	to	drone  The	output	indicates	that	the	restful01 drones migrations 0003_drone_owner.py file	includes	the	code	to	add	the	field	named	owner	to	the	drone	table.	The following	lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	was	automatically generated	by	Django.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the restful01 drones migrations 0003_drone_owner.py	file:  	-*-	coding:	utf-8	-*- 	Generated	by	Django	1.11.5	on	2017-11-09	22:04 from	__future__	import	unicode_literals from	django.conf	import	settings from	django.db	import	migrations,	models import	django.db.models.deletion  class	Migration migrations.Migration :  				dependencies	=	[ 								migrations.swappable_dependency settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL ,   								 'drones',	'0002_auto_20171104_0246' , 				]  				operations	=	[ 								migrations.AddField  												model_name='drone', 												name='owner', 												field=models.ForeignKey default=1,	on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE,	related_name='drones',	to=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL , 												preserve_default=False, 								 , 				]  The	code	declares	the	Migration	class	as	a	subclass	of	the django.db.migrations.Migration	class.	The	Migration	class	defines	an	operations list	with	a	migrations.AddField	instance	that	will	add	the	owner	field	to	the table	related	to	the	drone	model.  Now,	run	the	following	Python	script	to	apply	all	the	generated	migrations and	execute	the	changes	in	the	database	tables:  				python	manage.py	migrate  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command:  Operations	to	perform: Apply	all	migrations:	admin,	auth,	contenttypes,	drones,	sessions Running	migrations: Applying	drones.0003_drone_owner...	OK  After	we	run	the	previous	command,	we	will	have	a	new	owner_id	field	in the	drones_drone	table	in	the	PostgreSQL	database.	The	existing	rows	in	the drones_drone	table	will	use	the	default	value	we	instructed	Django	to	use	for the	new	owner_id	field:	1.	This	way,	the	superuser	named	'djangosuper'	will	be the	owner	for	all	the	existing	drones.  We	can	use	the	PostgreSQL	command	line	or	any	other	application	that   allows	us	to	easily	check	the	contents	of	the	PostreSQL	database	to	browse the	drones_drone	table	that	Django	updated.  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	new	structure	for	the	drones_drone	table at	the	left-hand	side	and	all	its	rows	at	the	right-hand	side:   Creating	a	user	for	Django  Now,	we	will	use	Django's	interactive	shell	to	create	a	new	user	for Django.	Run	the	following	command	to	launch	Django's	interactive	shell. Make	sure	you	are	within	the	restful01	folder	in	the	terminal,	Command Prompt,	or	Windows	Powershell	window	in	which	you	have	the	virtual environment	activated:  				python	manage.py	shell  You	will	notice	that	a	line	that	says	 InteractiveConsole 	is	displayed	after the	usual	lines	that	introduce	your	default	Python	interactive	shell.	Enter the	following	code	in	the	shell	to	create	another	user	that	is	not	a superuser.	We	will	use	this	user	and	the	superuser	to	test	our	changes	in the	permissions	policies.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the	scripts create_user.py	file.	You	can replace	user01	with	your	desired	username,	user01@example.com	with	the	email and	user01password	with	the	password	you	want	to	use	for	this	user.	Notice that	we	will	be	using	these	credentials	in	the	following	sections.	Make sure	you	always	replace	the	credentials	with	your	own	credentials:  from	django.contrib.auth.models	import	User  user	=	User.objects.create_user 'user01',	'user01@example.com',	'user01password'  user.save    Finally,	enter	the	following	command	to	quit	the	interactive	console:  quit     You	can	achieve	the	same	goal	by	pressing	Ctrl	+	D.	Now,	we	have	a	new user	for	Django	named	user01.   Making	authenticated	requests  Now,	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send authenticated	HTTP	requests	to	understand	how	the	configured authentication	classes,	combined	with	the	permission	policies,	work. Execute	any	of	the	following	two	commands	based	on	your	needs	to access	the	API	in	other	devices	or	computers	connected	to	your	LAN. Remember	that	we	analyzed	the	difference	between	them	in	Chapter 3,	Creating	API	Views,	in	the	Launching	Django's	development	server section:  				python	manage.py	runserver 				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000  After	we	run	any	of	the	previous	commands,	the	development	server	will start	listening	at	port	8000.  We	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	POST	request	without	authentication credentials	to	try	to	create	a	new	drone:  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	POST	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d			 			'{"name":"Python	Drone",	"drone_category":"Quadcopter",	 				"manufacturing_date":	"2017-07-16T02:03:00.716312Z",		 				"has_it_competed":	"false"}'	localhost:8000 drones   We	will	receive	an	HTTP	401	Unauthorized	status	code	in	the	response	header  http	POST	:8000 drones 	name="Python	Drone"	drone_category="Quadcopter"	manufacturing_date="2017-07-16T02:03:00.716312Z"	has_it_competed=false   and	a	detail	message	indicating	that	we	didn't	provide	authentication credentials	in	the	JSON	body.

Now,	we	will	compose	and send	an	HTTP	request	to	create	a	new	drone	with	authentication credentials,	that	is,	with	the	superuser	name	and	his	password.	Remember to	replace	djangosuper	with	the	name	you	used	for	the	superuser	and passwordforsuper	with	the	password	you	configured	for	this	user:  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	--user	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	-iX	POST	-H	"Content- 				Type:	application json"	-d	'{"name":"Python	Drone",	 				"drone_category":"Quadcopter",	"manufacturing_date":	"2017-07- 					16T02:03:00.716312Z",	"has_it_competed":	"false"}'	 					localhost:8000 drones   The	new	Drone	with	the	superuser	named	djangosuper	as	its	owner	has	been successfully	created	and	persisted	in	the	database	because	the	request	was  http	-a	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	POST	:8000 drones 	name="Python	Drone"	drone_category="Quadcopter"	manufacturing_date="2017-07-16T02:03:00.716312Z"	has_it_competed=false   authenticated.	As	a	result	of	the	request,	we	will	receive	an	HTTP	201	Created status	code	in	the	response	header	and	the	recently	persisted	Drone serialized	to	JSON	in	the	response	body.	The	following	lines	show	an example	response	for	the	HTTP	request,	with	the	new	Drone	object	in	the JSON	response	body.

However,	we	will	use	the	other user	we	created	in	Django	to	authenticate	this	HTTP	PATCH	request.	This user	isn't	the	owner	of	the	drone,	and	therefore,	the	request	shouldn't succeed.  Replace	user01	and	user01password	in	the	next	command	with	the	name	and password	you	configured	for	this	user.	In	addition,	replace	12	with	the	ID generated	for	the	previously	created	drone	in	your	configuration:  http	-a	"user01":"user01password"	PATCH	:8000 drones 12	has_it_competed=true   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  curl	--user	"user01":"user01password"	-iX	PATCH	-H	"Content-Type:	application json"	-d	'{"has_it_competed":	"true"}'	localhost:8000 drones 12  We	will	receive	an	HTTP	403	Forbidden	status	code	in	the	response	header	and a	detail	message	indicating	that	we	do	not	have	permission	to	perform	the action	in	the	JSON	body.	The	owner	for	the	drone	we	want	to	update	is djangosuper	and	the	authentication	credentials	for	this	request	use	a	different user:	user01.	Hence,	the	operation	is	rejected	by	the	has_object_permission method	in	the	IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly	customized	permission	class	we created.	The	following	lines	show	a	sample	response:  				HTTP 1.0	403	Forbidden 				Allow:	GET,	PUT,	PATCH,	DELETE,	HEAD,	OPTIONS 				Content-Length:	63 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Fri,	10	Nov	2017	03:34:43	GMT 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"detail":	"You	do	not	have	permission	to	perform	this	action." 				} 		  The	user	that	isn't	the	drone's	owner	cannot	make	changes	to	the	drone. However,	he	must	be	able	to	have	read-only	access	to	the	drone.	Hence, we	must	be	able	to	compose	and	retrieve	the	previous	drone	details	with an	HTTP	GET	request	with	the	same	authentication	credentials.	It	will	work because	GET	is	one	of	the	safe	methods	and	a	user	that	is	not	the	owner	is allowed	to	read	the	resource.	Replace	user01	and	user01password	in	the	next command	with	the	name	and	password	you	configured	for	this	user.	In addition,	replace	12	with	the	ID	generated	for	the	previously	created	drone in	your	configuration:  				http	-a	"user01":"user01password"	GET	:8000 drones 12   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	--user	"user01":"user01password"	-iX	GET	 				localhost:8000 drones 12  The	response	will	return	an	HTTP	200	OK	status	code	in	the	header	and	the requested	Drone	serialized	to	JSON	in	the	response	body.   Making	authenticated	HTTP PATCH	requests	with	Postman  Now,	we	will	use	one	of	the	GUI	tools	we	installed	in	Chapter 1,	Installing	the	Required	Software	and	Tools,	specifically,	Postman.	We will	use	this	GUI	tool	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	PATCH	request	with	the appropriate	authentication	credentials	to	the	web	service.	In	the	previous chapters,	whenever	we	worked	with	Postman,	we	didn't	specify authentication	credentials.  We	will	use	the	Builder	tab	in	Postman	to	compose	and	send	an	HTTP PATCH	request	to	update	the	has_it_competed	field	for	the	previously	created drone.	Follow	these	steps:  1.	 In	case	you	made	previous	requests	with	Postman,	click	on	the  plus	 + 	button	at	the	right-hand	side	of	the	tab	that	displayed	the previous	request.	This	way,	you	will	create	a	new	tab.  2.	 Select	PATCH	in	the	drop-down	menu	at	the	left-hand	side	of	the  Enter	request	URL	textbox.  3.	 Enter	http:  localhost:8000 drones 12	in	that	textbox	at	the	right-hand  side	of	the	drop-down.	Replace	12	with	the	ID	generated	for	the previously	created	drone	in	your	configuration. 4.	 Click	the	Authorization	tab	below	the	textbox. 5.	 Select	Basic	Auth	in	the	TYPE	drop-down. 6.	 Enter	the	name	you	used	to	create	djangosuper	in	the	Username  textbox.  7.	 Enter	the	password	you	used	instead	of	passwordforsuper	for	this	user  in	the	Password	textbox.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the   basic	authentication	configured	in	Postman	for	the	HTTP	PATCH request:  8.	 Click	Body	at	the	right-hand	side	of	the	Authorization	and Headers	tabs,	within	the	panel	that	composes	the	request.  9.	 Activate	the	raw	radio	button	and	select	JSON	 application json  in	the	drop-down	at	the	right-hand	side	of	the	binary	radio	button. Postman	will	automatically	add	a	Content-type	=	application json header,	and	therefore,	you	will	notice	the	Headers	tab	will	be renamed	to	Headers	 1 ,	indicating	to	us	that	there	is	one key value	pair	specified	for	the	request	headers.  10.	 Enter	the	following	lines	in	the	textbox	below	the	radio	buttons,  within	the	Body	tab:  			{	 							"has_it_competed":	"true"	 			}  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	request	body	in	Postman:   We	followed	the	necessary	steps	to	create	an	HTTP	PATCH	request	with	a JSON	body	that	specifies	the	necessary	key value	pairs	to	update	the	value for	the	was_included_in_home	field	of	an	existing	drone,	with	the	necessary HTTP	authentication	credentials.	Click	Send	and	Postman	will	display	the following	information:  Status:	200	OK  Time:	The	time	it	took	for	the	request	to	be	processed  Size:	The	approximate	response	size	 sum	of	body	size	plus headers	size   Body:	The	response	body	with	the	recently	updated	drone formatted	as	JSON	with	syntax	highlighting  The	following	screenshot	shows	the	JSON	response	body	in	Postman	for the	HTTP	PATCH	request.	In	this	case,	the	request	updated	the	existing	drone because	we	authenticated	the	request	with	the	user	that	is	the	drone's owner:    Browsing	the	secured	API	with the	required	authentication  We	want	the	browsable	API	to	display	the	log	in	and	log	out	views.	In order	to	make	this	possible,	we	have	to	add	a	line	in	the	urls.py	file	in	the restful01 restful01	folder,	specifically,	in	the	restful01 restful01 urls.py	file. The	file	defines	the	root	URL	configurations	and	we	want	to	include	the URL	patterns	provided	by	the	Django	REST	framework	that	provide	the log	in	and	log	out	views.  The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	for	the	restful01 restful01 urls.py file.	The	new	line	is	highlighted.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_01	folder,	in	the	restful01 restful01 urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url,	include 	 urlpatterns	=	[ 				url r'^',	include 'drones.urls'  , 				url r'^api-auth ',	include 'rest_framework.urls'   ]  Open	a	web	browser	and	go	to	http:  localhost:8000 .	Replace	localhost	by the	IP	of	the	computer	that	is	running	Django's	development	server	in	case you	use	another	computer	or	device	to	run	the	browser.	The	browsable API	will	compose	and	send	a	GET	request	to	 	and	will	display	the	results	of its	execution,	that	is,	the	Api	Root.	You	will	notice	there	is	a	Log	in hyperlink	at	the	upper-right	corner.  Click	or	tap	Log	in	and	the	browser	will	display	the	Django	REST framework	login	page.	Enter	the	name	you	used	to	create	djangosuper	in	the Username	textbox	and	the	password	you	used	instead	of	passwordforsuper	for this	user	in	the	Password	textbox.	Then,	click	Log	in.   Now,	you	will	be	logged	in	as	djangosuper	and	all	the	requests	you	compose and	send	through	the	browsable	API	will	use	this	user.	You	will	be redirected	again	to	the	Api	Root	and	you	will	notice	the	Log	in	hyperlink is	replaced	with	the	username	 djangosuper 	and	a	drop-down	menu	that allows	you	to	log	out.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	Api	Root	after we	are	logged	in	as	djangosuper:  Click	or	tap	on	the	username	that	is	logged	in	 djangosuper 	and	select Log	Out	from	the	drop-down	menu.	We	will	log	in	as	a	different	user.  Click	or	tap	Log	in	and	the	browser	will	display	the	Django	REST framework	login	page.	Enter	the	name	you	used	to	create	user01	in	the Username	textbox	and	the	password	you	used	instead	of	user01password	for this	user	in	the	Password	textbox.	Then,	click	Log	in.  Now,	you	will	be	logged	in	as	user01	and	all	the	requests	you	compose	and send	through	the	browsable	API	will	use	this	user.	You	will	be	redirected again	to	the	Api	Root	and	you	will	notice	the	Log	in	hyperlink	is	replaced with	the	username	 user01 .  Go	to	http:  localhost:8000 drones 12.	Replace	12	with	the	ID	generated	for the	previously	created	drone	in	your	configuration.	The	browsable	API will	render	the	web	page	with	the	results	for	the	GET	request	to localhost:8000 drones 12.   Click	or	tap	the	OPTIONS	button	and	the	browsable	API	will	render	the results	of	the	HTTP	OPTIONS	request	to	http:  localhost:8000 drones 12	and	will include	the	DELETE	button	at	the	right-hand	side	of	the	Drone	Detail title.  Click	or	tap	DELETE.	The	web	browser	will	display	a	confirmation modal.	Click	or	tap	the	DELETE	button	in	the	modal.	As	a	result	of	the HTTP	DELETE	request,	the	web	browser	will	display	an	HTTP	403	Forbidden status	code	in	the	response	header	and	a	detail	message	indicating	that	we do	not	have	permission	to	perform	the	action	in	the	JSON	body.	The owner	for	the	drone	we	want	to	delete	is	djangosuper	and	the	authentication credentials	for	this	request	use	a	different	user,	specifically,	user01.	Hence, the	operation	is	rejected	by	the	has_object_permission	method	in	the IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly	class.	The	following	screenshot	shows	a	sample response	for	the	HTTP	DELETE	request:  The	browsable	API	makes	it	easy	to	compose	and	send authenticated	requests	to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.   Working	with	token-based authentication  Now,	we	will	make	changes	to	use	token-based	authentication	to	retrieve, update,	or	delete	pilots.	Only	those	users	that	have	a	token	will	be	able	to make	these	operations	with	pilots.	Hence,	we	will	setup	a	specific authentication	for	pilots.	It	will	still	be	possible	to	see	the	pilot's	name rendered	in	unauthenticated	requests.  The	token-based	authentication	requires	a	new	model	named	Token.	Make sure	you	quit	the	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you	just need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	command	prompt	window	in which	it	is	running.  Of	course,	in	a	production	environment,	we	must	make	sure that	the	RESTful	Web	Service	is	only	available	over	HTTPS, with	the	usage	of	the	latest	TLS	versions.	We	shouldn't	use	a token-based	authentication	over	plain	HTTP	in	a	production environment.  Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares	module-level variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project. Locate	the	lines	that	assign	a	strings	list	to	INSTALLED_APPS	to	declare	the installed	apps.	Add	the	following	string	to	the	INSTALLED_APPS	strings	list	and save	the	changes	to	the	settings.py	file:  'rest_framework.authtoken'	  The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	that	declares	the	INSTALLED_APPS strings	list	with	the	added	line	highlighted	and	with	comments	to understand	what	each	added	string	means.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is   included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_02	folder	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  INSTALLED_APPS	=	[	 				'django.contrib.admin',	 				'django.contrib.auth',	 				'django.contrib.contenttypes',	 				'django.contrib.sessions',	 				'django.contrib.messages',	 				'django.contrib.staticfiles',	 					Django	REST	framework	 				'rest_framework',	 					Drones	application	 				'drones.apps.DronesConfig',	 					Django	Filters,	 				'django_filters',	 					Token	authentication	 				'rest_framework.authtoken', ]  This	way,	we	have	added	the	rest_framework.authtoken	application	to	our Django	project	named	restful01.  Now,	run	the	following	Python	script	to	execute	all	migrations	required	for the	recently	added	authtoken	application	and	apply	the	changes	in	the underlying	database	tables.	This	way,	we	will	install	the	app:  				python	manage.py	migrate  The	following	lines	show	the	output	generated	after	running	the	previous command.	Notice	that	the	order	in	which	the	migrations	are	executed	can differ	in	your	development	computer:  				Operations	to	perform: 						Apply	all	migrations:	admin,	auth,	authtoken,	contenttypes,	 						drones,	sessions 						Running	migrations: 						Applying	authtoken.0001_initial...	OK 						Applying	authtoken.0002_auto_20160226_1747...	OK   After	we	run	the	previous	command,	we	will	have	a	new	authtoken_token table	in	the	PostgreSQL	database.	This	table	will	persist	the	generated tokens	and	has	a	foreign	key	to	the	auth_user	table.  We	will	configure	authentication	and	permission	policies	for	the	class- based	views	that	work	with	the	Pilot	model.	We	will	override	the	values for	the	authentication_classes	and	permission_classes	class	attributes	for	the PilotDetail	and	PilotList	classes.  We	will	add	the	same	lines	of	code	in	the	two	classes.	We	will	include	the TokenAuthentication	authentication	class	in	the	authentication_classes	tuple,	and the	IsAuthenticated	permission	class	in	the	permission_classes	tuple.  Open	the	restful01 drones views.py	file	and	add	the	following	lines	after	the last	line	that	declares	the	imports,	before	the	declaration	of	the DroneCategorySerializer	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_08_02	folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  from	rest_framework.permissions	import	IsAuthenticated	 from	rest_framework.authentication	import	TokenAuthentication  Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	PilotDetail	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_02 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	PilotDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-detail'	 				authentication_classes	=	  								TokenAuthentication, 								  				permission_classes	=	  								IsAuthenticated, 								    Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	PilotList	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_02 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	PilotList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'gender',	 								'races_count',	 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'races_count'	 								 	 				authentication_classes	=	  								TokenAuthentication, 								  				permission_classes	=	  								IsAuthenticated, 								    Generating	and	using	tokens  Now,	we	will	launch	our	default	Python	interactive	shell	in	our	virtual environment	and	make	all	the	Django	project	modules	available	to	write code	that	will	generate	a	token	for	an	existing	user.	We	will	do	this	to understand	how	the	token	generation	works.  Run	the	following	command	to	launch	the	interactive	shell.	Make	sure	you are	within	the	restful01	folder	in	the	terminal,	Command	Prompt,	or Windows	Powershell:  			python	manage.py	shell  You	will	notice	that	a	line	that	says	 InteractiveConsole 	is	displayed	after the	usual	lines	that	introduce	your	default	Python	interactive	shell.	Enter the	following	code	in	the	Python	interactive	shell	to	import	all	the	things we	will	need	to	retrieve	a	User	instance	and	generate	a	new	token.	The	code file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_02	folder,	in	the restful01 tokens_test_01.py	file.  from	rest_framework.authtoken.models	import	Token	 from	django.contrib.auth.models	import	User	  Enter	the	following	code	to	retrieve	an	instance	of	the	User	model	whose username	matches	"user01"	and	create	a	new	Token	instance	related	to	this user.	The	last	line	prints	the	value	for	the	key	attribute	for	the	generated Token	instance	saved	in	the	token	variable.	Replace	user01	in	the	next	lines with	the	name	you	configured	for	this	user.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_08_02	folder,	in	the restful01 tokens_test_01.py	file:   	Replace	user01	with	the	name	you	configured	for	this	user	 user	=	User.objects.get username="user01" 	 token	=	Token.objects.create user=user 	 print token.key 	  The	following	line	shows	a	sample	output	from	the	previous	code	with	the string	value	for	token.key.	Copy	the	output	generated	when	running	the code	because	we	will	use	this	token	to	authenticate	requests.	Notice	that the	token	generated	in	your	system	will	be	different:  				ebebe08f5d7fe5997f9ed1761923ec5d3e461dc3  Finally,	enter	the	following	command	to	quit	the	interactive	console:  				quit    Now,	we	have	a	token	for	the	Django	user	named	user01.  Now,	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	retrieve	pilots	to	understand	how	the	configured	token authentication	class	combined	with	the	permission	policies	work.	Execute any	of	the	following	two	commands	based	on	your	needs	to	access	the API	in	other	devices	or	computers	connected	to	your	LAN.	Remember that	we	analyzed	the	difference	between	them	in	Chapter	3,	Creating	API Views,	in	the	Launching	Django's	development	server	section:  				python	manage.py	runserver 				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000  After	we	run	any	of	the	previous	commands,	the	development	server	will start	listening	at	port	8000.  We	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	GET	request	without	authentication credentials	to	try	to	retrieve	the	first	page	of	the	pilots	collection:   				http	:8000 pilots   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 pilots   We	will	receive	an	HTTP	401	Unauthorized	status	code	in	the	response	header and	a	detail	message	indicating	that	we	didn't	provide	authentication credentials	in	the	JSON	body.	In	addition,	the	value	for	the	WWW-Authenticate header	specifies	the	authentication	method	that	must	be	applied	to	access the	resource	collection:	Token.	The	following	lines	show	a	sample	response:  HTTP 1.0	401	Unauthorized Allow:	GET,	POST,	HEAD,	OPTIONS Content-Length:	58 Content-Type:	application json Date:	Sat,	18	Nov	2017	02:28:31	GMT Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 Vary:	Accept WWW-Authenticate:	Token X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN  { 				"detail":	"Authentication	credentials	were	not	provided." }  After	the	changes	we	made,	if	we	want	to	retrieve	the	collection	of	pilots, that	is,	to	make	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	 pilots ,	we	need	to	provide authentication	credentials	by	using	the	token-based	authentication.	Now, we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	request	to	retrieve	the	collection	of pilots	with	authentication	credentials,	that	is,	with	the	token.	Remember	to replace	PASTE-TOKEN-HERE	with	the	previously	generated	token:  				http	:8000 pilots 	"Authorization:	Token	PASTE-TOKEN-HERE"   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  		curl	-iX	GET	http:  localhost:8000 pilots 	-H	"Authorization:	Token	 		PASTE-TOKEN-HERE"  As	a	result	of	the	request,	we	will	receive	an	HTTP	200	OK	status	code	in	the response	header	and	the	first	page	of	the	pilots	collection	serialized	to JSON	in	the	response	body.	The	following	screenshot	shows	the	first	lines of	a	sample	response	for	the	request	with	the	appropriate	token:  The	token-based	authentication	provided	with	the	Django	REST framework	is	very	simple	and	it	requires	customization	to	make	it production	ready.	Tokens	never	expire	and	there	is	no	setting	to	specify	the default	expiration	time	for	a	token.   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly.  1.	 The	permissions.SAFE_METHODS	tuple	of	string	includes	the	following  HTTP	methods	or	verbs	that	are	considered	safe:  1.	 'GET',	'HEAD',	and	'OPTIONS' 2.	 'POST',	'PATCH',	and	'OPTIONS' 3.	 'GET',	'PUT',	and	'OPTIONS'  2.	 Which	of	the	following	settings	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary  specifies	the	global	setting	with	a	tuple	of	string	whose	values indicate	the	classes	that	we	want	to	use	for	authentication?  3.	 Which	of	the	following	is	the	model	that	persists	a	Django	user?  1.	 'GLOBAL_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES' 2.	 'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES' 3.	 'REST_FRAMEWORK_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES'  1.	 Django.contrib.auth.DjangoUser 2.	 Django.contrib.auth.User 3.	 Django.rest-framework.User  4.	 Which	of	the	following	classes	is	the	base	class	from	which	all   customized	permission	classes	should	inherit	to	work	with	the Django	REST	framework?  1.	 Django.contrib.auth.MainPermission 2.	 rest_framework.permissions.MainPermission 3.	 rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission  5.	 In	order	to	configure	permission	policies	for	a	class-based	view, which	of	the	following	class	attributes	do	we	have	to	override?  1.	 permission_classes 2.	 permission_policies_classes 3.	 rest_framework_permission_classes  	  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	learned	the	differences	between	authentication	and permissions	in	Django,	the	Django	REST	framework,	and	RESTful	Web Services.	We	analyzed	the	authentication	classes	included	in	the	Django REST	framework	out	of	the	box.  We	followed	the	necessary	steps	to	include	security	and	permissions- related	data	to	models.	We	worked	with	object-level	permissions	via customized	permission	classes	and	we	saved	information	about	users	that make	requests.	We	understood	that	there	are	three	HTTP	methods	or	verbs that	are	considered	safe.  We	configured	permission	policies	for	the	class-based	views	that	worked with	the	Drone	model.	Then,	we	created	a	superuser	and	another	user	for Django	to	compose	and	send	authenticated	requests	and	to	understand	how the	permission	policies	we	configured	were	working.  We	used	command-line	tools	and	GUI	tools	to	compose	and	send authenticated	requests.	Then,	we	browsed	the	secured	RESTful	Web Service	with	the	browsable	API	feature.	Finally,	we	worked	with	a	simple token-based	authentication	provided	by	the	Django	REST	framework	to understand	another	way	of	authenticating	requests.  Now	that	we	have	improved	our	RESTful	Web	Service	with	authentication and	permission	policies,	it	is	time	to	combine	these	policies	with	throttling rules	and	versioning.	We	will	cover	these	topics	in	the	next	chapter.   Applying	Throttling	Rules	and Versioning	Management  In	this	chapter,	we	will	work	with	throttling	rules	to	limit	the	usage	of	our RESTful	Web	Service.	We	don't	want	to	process	requests	until	our RESTful	Web	Service	runs	out	of	resources,	and	therefore,	we	will analyze	the	importance	of	throttling	rules.	We	will	take	advantage	of	the features	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	to	manage	different versions	of	our	web	service.	We	will	gain	an	understanding	of:  Understanding	the	importance	of	throttling	rules  Learning	the	purpose	of	the	different	throttling	classes	in	the Django	REST	framework  Configuring	throttling	policies	in	the	Django	REST	framework  Running	tests	to	check	that	throttling	policies	work	as	expected  Understanding	versioning	classes  Configuring	the	versioning	scheme  Running	tests	to	check	that	versioning	works	as	expected   Understanding	the	importance of	throttling	rules  In	Chapter	8,	Securing	the	API	with	Authentication	and	Permissions,	we made	sure	that	some	requests	were	authenticated	before	processing	them. We	took	advantage	of	many	authentication	schemes	to	identify	the	user that	originated	the	request.	Throttling	rules	also	determine	whether	the request	must	be	authorized	or	not.	We	will	work	with	them	in	combination with	authentication.  So	far,	we	haven't	established	any	limits	on	the	usage	of	our	RESTful	Web Service.	As	a	result	of	this	configuration,	both	unauthenticated	and authenticated	users	can	compose	and	send	as	many	requests	as	they	want to.	The	only	thing	we	have	limited	is	the	resultset	size	throughout	the configuration	of	the	pagination	features	available	in	the	Django	REST framework.	Hence,	large	results	sets	are	split	into	individual	pages	of	data. However,	a	user	might	compose	and	send	thousands	of	requests	to	be processed	with	any	kind	of	limitation.	Of	course,	the	servers	or	virtual machines	that	run	our	RESTful	Web	Services	or	the	underlying	database can	be	overloaded	by	the	huge	amount	of	requests	because	we	don't	have limits.  Throttles	control	the	rate	of	requests	that	users	can	make	to	our	RESTful Web	Service.	The	Django	REST	framework	makes	it	easy	to	configure throttling	rules.	We	will	use	throttling	rules	to	configure	the	following limitations	to	the	usage	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service:  A	maximum	of	3	requests	per	hour	for	unauthenticated	users  A	maximum	of	10	requests	per	hour	for	authenticated	users  A	maximum	of	20	requests	per	hour	for	the	drones	related	views   A	maximum	of	15	requests	per	hour	for	the	pilots	related	views   Learning	the	purpose	of	the different	throttling	classes	in the	Django	REST	framework  The	Django	REST	framework	provides	three	throttling	classes	in	the rest_framework.throttling	module.	All	of	them	are	subclasses	of	the SimpleRateThrottle	class	which	inherits	from	the	BaseThrottle	class.  The	three	classes	allow	us	to	specify	throttling	rules	that	indicate	the maximum	number	of	requests	in	a	specific	period	of	time	and	within	a determined	scope.	Each	class	is	responsible	for	computing	and	validating the	maximum	number	of	requests	per	period.	The	classes	provide	different mechanisms	to	determine	the	previous	request	information	to	specify	the scope	by	comparing	it	with	the	new	request.	The	Django	REST	framework stores	the	required	data	to	analyze	each	throttling	rule	in	the	cache.	Thus, the	classes	override	the	inherited	get_cache_key	method	that	determines	the scope	that	will	be	used	for	computing	and	validating.  The	following	are	the	three	throttling	classes:  AnonRateThrottle:	This	class	limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	an anonymous	user	can	make,	and	therefore,	its	rules	apply	to unauthenticated	users.	The	unique	cache	key	is	the	IP	address	of the	incoming	request.	Hence,	all	the	requests	originated	in	the same	IP	address	will	accumulate	the	total	number	of	requests	for this	IP.  UserRateThrottle:	This	class	limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	a	specific user	can	make	and	applies	to	both	authenticated	and	non-   authenticated	users.	Obviously,	when	the	requests	are authenticated,	the	authenticated	user	ID	is	the	unique	cache	key. When	the	requests	are	unauthenticated	and	come	from	anonymous users,	the	unique	cache	key	is	the	IP	address	of	the	incoming request.  ScopedRateThrottle:	This	class	is	useful	whenever	we	have	to	restrict access	to	specific	features	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service	with different	rates.	The	class	uses	the	value	assigned	to	the throttle_scope	attribute	to	limit	requests	to	the	parts	that	are identified	with	the	same	value.  The	previous	classes	are	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	out	of the	box.	There	are	many	additional	throttling	classes	provided	by	many third-party	libraries.  Make	sure	you	quit	the	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you just	need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	Command	Prompt	window	in which	it	is	running.	We	will	make	the	necessary	changes	to	combine	the different	authentication	mechanisms	we	set	up	in	the	previous	chapter	with the	application	of	throttling	rules.	Hence,	we	will	add	the	AnonRateThrottle and	UserRateThrottle	classes	in	the	global	throttling	classes	list.  The	value	for	the	DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES	settings	key	specifies	a	global setting	with	a	tuple	of	string	whose	values	indicate	the	default	classes	that we	want	to	use	for	throttling	rules.	We	will	specify	the	AnonRateThrottle	and UserRateThrottle	classes.  The	DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES	settings	key	specifies	a	dictionary	with	the	default throttle	rates.	The	next	list	specifies	the	keys,	the	values	that	we	will assign	and	their	meaning:  'anon':	We	will	specify	'3 hour'	as	the	value	for	this	key,	which   means	we	want	a	maximum	of	3	requests	per	hour	for	anonymous users.	The	AnonRateThrottle	class	will	apply	this	throttling	rule.  'user':	We	will	specify	'10 hour'	as	the	value	for	this	key,	which means	we	want	a	maximum	of	10	requests	per	hour	for authenticated	users.	The	UserRateThrottle	class	will	apply	this throttling	rule.  'drones':	We	will	specify	'20 hour'	as	the	value	for	this	key,	which means	we	want	a	maximum	of	20	requests	per	hour	for	the drones-related	views.	The	ScopedRateThrottle	class	will	apply	this throttling	rule.  'pilots':	We	will	specify	'15 hour'	as	the	value	for	this	key,	which means	we	want	a	maximum	of	15	requests	per	hour	for	the drones-related	views.	The	ScopedRateThrottle	class	will	apply	this throttling	rule.  The	maximum	rate	value	for	each	key	is	a	string	that	specifies	the	number of	requests	per	period	with	the	following	format:	'number_of_requests period', where	period	can	be	any	of	the	following:  d:	day  day:	day  h:	hour  hour:	hour  m:	minute  min:	minute  s:	second   sec:	second  In	this	case,	we	will	always	work	with	a	maximum	number	of requests	per	hour,	and	therefore,	the	values	will	use	 hour after	the	maximum	number	of	requests.  Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares	module-level variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the	restful01	project. We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file.	Add	the highlighted	lines	to	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	following	lines	show the	new	declaration	of	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	code	file	for	the sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_01	folder	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{	 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':	 				'drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound',	 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4,	 				'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS':	 	 								'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',	 								'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',	 								'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES':	 	 								'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',	 								'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES':	 	 								'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',	 								'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',	 				 ,	 				'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES':	{	 								'anon':	'3 hour',	 								'user':	'10 hour',	 								'drones':	'20 hour',	 								'pilots':	'15 hour',	 				}	 }	  We	added	values	for	the	DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES	and	the	DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES settings	keys	to	configure	the	default	throttling	classes	and	the	desired   rates.   Configuring	throttling	policies in	the	Django	REST	framework  Now,	we	will	configure	throttling	policies	for	the	class-based	views	related to	drones:	DroneList	and	DroneDetail.	We	will	override	the	values	for	the following	class	attributes	for	the	class-based	views:  throttle_classes:	This	class	attribute	specifies	a	tuple	with	the names	of	the	classes	that	will	manage	throttling	rules	for	the	class. In	this	case,	we	will	specify	the	ScopedRateThrottle	class	as	the	only member	of	the	tuple.  throttle_scope:	This	class	attribute	specifies	the	throttle	scope	name that	the	ScopedRateThrottle	class	will	use	to	accumulate	the	number of	requests	and	limit	the	rate	of	requests.  This	way,	we	will	make	these	class-based	views	work	with	the ScopedRateThrottle	class	and	we	will	configure	the	throttle	scope	that	this class	will	consider	for	each	of	the	class	based	views	related	to	drones.  Open	the	restful01 drones views.py	file	and	add	the	following	lines	after	the last	line	that	declares	the	imports,	before	the	declaration	of	the DroneCategoryList	class:  from	rest_framework.throttling	import	ScopedRateThrottle		  Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	DroneDetail	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_01   folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				throttle_scope	=	'drones'	 				throttle_classes	=	 ScopedRateThrottle, 	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-detail'	 				permission_classes	=	 	 								permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,	 								custompermission.IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly,	 								   Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	DroneList	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	DroneList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				throttle_scope	=	'drones'	 				throttle_classes	=	 ScopedRateThrottle, 	 				queryset	=	Drone.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	DroneSerializer	 				name	=	'drone-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'drone_category',		 								'manufacturing_date',		 								'has_it_competed',		 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'manufacturing_date',	 								 	 				permission_classes	=	 	 								permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,	 								custompermission.IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly,	 								 	 	 				def	perform_create self,	serializer :	 								serializer.save owner=self.request.user 	   We	added	the	same	lines	in	the	two	classes.	We	assigned	'drones'	to	the throttle_scope	class	attribute	and	we	included	ScopedRateThrottle	in	the	tuple that	defines	the	value	for	throttle_classes.	This	way,	the	two	class-based views	will	use	the	settings	specified	for	the	'drones'	scope	and	the ScopeRateThrottle	class	for	throttling.	We	added	the	'drones'	key	to	the DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary,	and	therefore,	the 'drones'	scope	is	configured	to	serve	a	maximum	of	20	requests	per	hour.  Now,	we	will	configure	throttling	policies	for	the	class-based	views	related to	pilots:	PilotList	and	PilotDetail.	We	will	also	override	the	values	for	the throttle_scope	and	throttle_classes	class	attributes.  Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	PilotDetail	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	PilotDetail generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView :	 				throttle_scope	=	'pilots'	 				throttle_classes	=	 ScopedRateThrottle, 	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-detail'	 				authentication_classes	=	 	 								TokenAuthentication,	 								 	 				permission_classes	=	 	 								IsAuthenticated,	 								 	  Replace	the	code	that	declares	the	PilotList	class	with	the	following	code in	the	same	views.py	file.	The	new	lines	are	highlighted	in	the	code	listing. The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_01 folder,	in	the	restful01 drones views.py	file:  class	PilotList generics.ListCreateAPIView :	 				throttle_scope	=	'pilots'	   				throttle_classes	=	 ScopedRateThrottle, 	 				queryset	=	Pilot.objects.all  	 				serializer_class	=	PilotSerializer	 				name	=	'pilot-list'	 				filter_fields	=	 	 								'name',		 								'gender',	 								'races_count',	 								 	 				search_fields	=	 	 								'^name',	 								 	 				ordering_fields	=	 	 								'name',	 								'races_count'	 								 	 				authentication_classes	=	 	 								TokenAuthentication,	 								 	 				permission_classes	=	 	 								IsAuthenticated,	 								 	  We	added	the	same	lines	in	the	two	classes.	We	assigned	'pilots'	to	the throttle_scope	class	attribute	and	we	included	ScopedRateThrottle	in	the	tuple that	defines	the	value	for	throttle_classes.	This	way,	the	two	class-based views	will	use	the	settings	specified	for	the	'pilots'	scope	and	the ScopeRateThrottle	class	for	throttling.	We	added	the	'pilots'	key	to	the DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary,	and	therefore,	the 'drones'	scope	is	configured	to	serve	a	maximum	of	15	requests	per	hour.  All	the	class-based	views	we	have	edited	won't	take	into account	the	global	settings	that	applied	the	default	classes that	we	use	for	throttling:	AnonRateThrottle	and	UserRateThrottle. These	class-based	views	will	use	the	configuration	we	have specified	for	them.   Running	tests	to	check	that throttling	policies	work	as expected  Before	Django	runs	the	main	body	of	a	class-based	view,	it	performs	the checks	for	each	throttle	class	specified	in	the	throttle	classes	settings.	In the	drones	and	pilots-related	views,	we	wrote	code	that	overrides	the default	settings.  If	a	single	throttle	check	fails,	the	code	will	raise	a	Throttled	exception	and Django	won't	execute	the	main	body	of	the	view.	The	cache	is	responsible for	storing	previous	request	information	for	throttling	checking.  Now,	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	understand	how	the	configured	throttling	rules, combined	with	all	the	previous	configurations,	work.	Execute	any	of	the following	two	commands	based	on	your	needs	to	access	the	API	in	other devices	or	computers	connected	to	your	LAN.	Remember	that	we analyzed	the	difference	between	them	in	Chapter	3,	Creating	API	Views,	in the	Launching	Django's	development	server	section.  				python	manage.py	runserver 				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000  After	we	run	any	of	the	previous	commands,	the	development	server	will start	listening	at	port	8000.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP	GET	request	without authentication	credentials	to	retrieve	the	first	page	of	the	competitions	four times:   				http	:8000 competitions   We	can	also	use	the	features	of	the	shell	in	macOS	or	Linux	to	run	the previous	command	four	times	with	just	a	single	line	with	a	bash	shell.	The command	is	compatible	with	a	Cygwin	terminal	in	Windows.	We	must take	into	account	that	we	will	see	all	the	results	one	after	the	other	and	we will	have	to	scroll	to	understand	what	happened	with	each	execution:  				for	i	in	{1..4};	do	http	:8000 competitions ;	done;  The	following	line	allows	you	to	run	the	command	four	times	with	a single	line	in	Windows	PowerShell:  				1..4		foreach	{	http	:8000 competitions 	}  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	we	must	execute	four times:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 competitions   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	is	executed	four	times with	a	single	line	in	a	bash	shell	in	a	macOS	or	Linux,	or	a	Cygwin terminal	in	Windows:  				for	i	in	{1..4};	do	curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 competitions ;	done;  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	is	executed	four	times with	a	single	line	in	Windows	PowerShell:  				1..4		foreach	{	curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 competitions 	}   The	Django	REST	framework	won't	process	the	request	number	4.	The AnonRateThrottle	class	is	configured	as	one	of	the	default	throttle	classes	and its	throttle	settings	specify	a	maximum	of	3	requests	per	hour.	Hence,	we will	receive	an	HTTP	429	Too	many	requests	status	code	in	the	response header	and	a	message	indicating	that	the	request	was	throttled	and	the	time in	which	the	server	will	be	able	to	process	an	additional	request.	The	value for	the	Retry-After	key	in	the	response	header	provides	the	number	of seconds	that	we	must	wait	until	the	next	request:	2347.	The	following	lines show	a	sample	response.	Notice	that	the	number	of	seconds	might	be different	in	your	configuration:  				HTTP 1.0	429	Too	Many	Requests 				Allow:	GET,	POST,	HEAD,	OPTIONS 				Content-Length:	71 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Thu,	30	Nov	2017	03:07:28	GMT 				Retry-After:	2347 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"detail":	"Request	was	throttled.	Expected	available	in	2347	seconds." 				}  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP	GET	request	with authentication	credentials	to	retrieve	the	first	page	of	the	competitions	four times.	We	will	use	the	superuser	we	created	in	the	previous	chapter. Remember	to	replace	djangosuper	with	the	name	you	used	for	the	superuser and	passwordforsuper	with	the	password	you	configured	for	this	user	as shown	here:  				http	-a	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	:8000 competitions   In	a	Linux,	macOS	or	a	Cygwin	terminal,	we	can	run	the	previous command	four	times	with	the	following	single	line:   				for	i	in	{1..4};	do	http	-a	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	:8000 competitions ;	done;  The	following	line	allows	you	to	run	the	command	four	times	with	a single	line	in	Windows	PowerShell.  				1..4		foreach	{	http	-a	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	:8000 competitions 	} 		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	we	must	execute	four times:  				curl	--user	'djangosuper':'passwordforsuper'	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 competitions  		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	we	can	execute	four times	in	a	Linux,	macOS	or	a	Cygwin	terminal	with	a	single	line:  				for	i	in	{1..4};	do	curl	--user	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 competitions ;	done; 		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	is	executed	four	times with	a	single	line	in	Windows	PowerShell:  				1..4		foreach	{	curl	--user	"djangosuper":"passwordforsuper"	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 competitions 	} 		  In	this	case,	Django	will	process	the	request	number	4	because	we	have composed	and	sent	4	authenticated	requests	with	the	same	user.	The UserRateThrottle	class	is	configured	as	one	of	the	default	throttle	classes	and its	throttle	settings	specify	10	requests	per	hour.	We	still	have	6	requests before	we	accumulate	the	maximum	number	of	requests	per	hour.   If	we	compose	and	send	the	same	request	7	times	more,	we	will accumulate	11	requests	and	we	will	will	receive	an	HTTP	429	Too	many requests	status	code	in	the	response	header,	a	message	indicating	that	the request	was	throttled	and	the	time	in	which	the	server	will	be	able	to process	an	additional	request	after	the	last	execution.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP	GET	request	without authentication	credentials	to	retrieve	the	first	page	of	the	drones	collection 20	times:  				http	:8000 drones   We	can	use	the	features	of	the	shell	in	macOS	or	Linux	to	run	the	previous command	20	times	with	just	a	single	line	with	a	bash	shell.	The	command is	compatible	with	a	Cygwin	terminal	in	Windows:  				for	i	in	{1..20};	do	http	:8000 drones ;	done;  The	following	line	allows	you	to	run	the	command	20	times	with	a	single line	in	Windows	PowerShell:  				1..21		foreach	{	http	:8000 drones 	} 		  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	we	must	execute	20 times:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 drones   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	is	executed	20	times with	a	single	line	in	a	bash	shell	in	macOS	or	Linux,	or	a	Cygwin	terminal in	Windows:   				for	i	in	{1..21};	do	curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 drones ;	done;  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command	that	is	executed	20	times with	a	single	line	in	Windows	PowerShell:  				1..20		foreach	{	curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 drones 	}  The	Django	REST	framework	will	process	the	20	requests.	The	DroneList class	has	its	throttle_scope	class	attribute	set	to	'drones'	and	uses	the ScopedRateThrottle	class	to	accumulate	the	requests	in	the	specified	scope. The	'drones'	scope	is	configured	to	accept	a	maximum	of	20	requests	per hour,	and	therefore,	if	we	make	another	request	with	the	same	non- authenticated	user	and	this	request	accumulates	in	the	same	scope,	the request	will	be	throttled.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	retrieve	the	details for	a	drone.	Make	sure	you	replace	1	for	any	existing	drone	ID	value	that was	listed	in	the	results	for	the	previous	requests:  				http	:8000 drones 1  The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 drones 1  The	Django	REST	framework	won't	process	this	request.	The	request	ends up	routed	to	the	DroneDetail	class.	The	DroneDetail	class	has	its	throttle_scope class	attribute	set	to	'drones'	and	uses	the	ScopedRateThrottle	class	to accumulate	the	requests	in	the	specified	scope.	Thus,	both	the	DroneList	and the	DroneDetail	class	accumulate	in	the	same	scope.	The	new	request	from the	same	non-authenticated	user	becomes	the	request	number	21	for	the 'drones'	scope	that	is	configured	to	accept	a	maximum	of	20	requests	per   hour,	and	therefore,	we	will	receive	an	HTTP	429	Too	many	requests	status code	in	the	response	header	and	a	message	indicating	that	the	request	was throttled	and	the	time	in	which	the	server	will	be	able	to	process	an additional	request.	The	value	for	the	Retry-After	key	in	the	response	header provides	the	number	of	seconds	that	we	must	wait	until	the	next	request: 3138.	The	following	lines	show	a	sample	response.	Notice	that	the	number of	seconds	might	be	different	in	your	configuration:  				HTTP 1.0	429	Too	Many	Requests 				Allow:	GET,	PUT,	PATCH,	DELETE,	HEAD,	OPTIONS 				Content-Length:	71 				Content-Type:	application json 				Date:	Mon,	04	Dec	2017	03:55:14	GMT 				Retry-After:	3138 				Server:	WSGIServer 0.2	CPython 3.6.2 				Vary:	Accept,	Cookie 				X-Frame-Options:	SAMEORIGIN 				 				{ 								"detail":	"Request	was	throttled.	Expected	available	in	3138	seconds." 				}  Throttling	rules	are	extremely	important	to	make	sure	that users	don't	abuse	our	RESTful	Web	Service	and	that	we	keep control	of	the	resources	that	are	being	used	to	process incoming	requests.	We	should	never	put	a	RESTful	Web Service	in	production	without	a	clear	configuration	for throttling	rules.   Understanding	versioning classes  Sometimes,	we	have	to	keep	many	different	versions	of	a	RESTful	Web Service	alive	at	the	same	time.	For	example,	we	might	need	to	have version	1	and	version	2	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service	accepting	and processing	requests.	There	are	many	versioning	schemes	that	make	it possible	to	serve	many	versions	of	a	web	service.  The	Django	REST	framework	provides	five	classes	in	the rest_framework.versioning	module.	All	of	them	are	subclasses	of	the BaseVersioning	class.	The	five	classes	allow	us	to	work	with	a	specific versioning	scheme.  We	can	use	one	of	these	classes	in	combination	with	changes	in	the	URL configurations	and	other	pieces	of	code	to	support	the	selected	versioning scheme.	Each	class	is	responsible	for	determining	the	version	based	on	the implemented	schema	and	to	make	sure	that	the	specified	version	number is	a	valid	one	based	on	the	allowed	version	settings.	The	classes	provide different	mechanisms	to	determine	the	version	number.	The	following	are the	five	versioning	classes:  AcceptHeaderVersioning:	This	class	configures	a	versioning	scheme that	requires	each	request	to	specify	the	desired	version	as	an additional	value	of	the	media	type	specified	as	a	value	for	the Accept	key	in	the	header.	For	example,	if	a	request	specifies 'application json;	version=1.2'	as	the	value	for	the	Accept	key	in	the header,	the	AcceptHeaderVersioning	class	will	set	the	request.version attribute	to	'1.2'.	This	scheme	is	known	as	media	type	versioning, content	negotiation	versioning	or	accept	header	versioning.   HostNameVersioning:	This	class	configures	a	versioning	scheme	that requires	each	request	to	specify	the	desired	version	as	a	value included	in	the	hostname	in	the	URL.	For	example,	if	a	request specifies	v2.myrestfulservice.com drones 	as	the	URL,	it	means	that the	request	wants	to	work	with	version	number	2	of	the	RESTful Web	Service.	This	scheme	is	known	as	hostname	versioning	or domain	versioning.  URLPathVersioning:	This	class	configures	a	versioning	scheme	that requires	each	request	to	specify	the	desired	version	as	a	value included	in	the	URL	path.	For	example,	if	a	request	specifies v2 myrestfulservice.com drones 	as	the	URL,	it	means	that	the	request wants	to	work	with	version	number	2	of	the	RESTful	Web Service.	The	class	requires	us	to	work	with	a	version	URL	keyword argument.	This	scheme	is	known	as	URI	versioning	or	URL	path versioning.  NamespaceVersioning:	This	class	configures	the	versioning	scheme explained	for	the	URLPathVersioning	class.	The	only	difference compared	with	this	other	class	is	that	the	configuration	in	the Django	REST	framework	application	is	different.	In	this	case,	it	is necessary	to	use	URL	namespacing.  QueryParameterVersioning:	This	class	configures	a	versioning	scheme that	requires	each	request	to	specify	the	desired	version	as	a	query parameter.	For	example,	if	a	request	specifies	myrestfulservice.com ? version=1.2,	the	QueryParameterVersioning	class	will	set	the request.version	attribute	to	'1.2'.	This	scheme	is	known	as	query parameter	versioning	or	request	parameter	versioning.  The	previous	classes	are	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	out	of   the	box.	It	is	also	possible	to	code	our	own	customized	versioning	scheme. Each	versioning	scheme	has	its	advantages	and	trade-offs.	In	this	case,	we will	work	with	the	NamespaceVersioning	class	to	provide	a	new	version	of	the RESTful	Web	Service	with	a	minor	change	compared	to	the	first	version. However,	it	is	necessary	to	analyze	carefully	whether	you	really	need	to use	any	versioning	scheme.	Then,	you	need	to	figure	out	which	is	the	most appropriate	one	based	on	your	specific	needs.	Of	course,	if	possible,	we should	always	avoid	any	versioning	scheme	because	they	add	complexity to	our	RESTful	Web	Service.   Configuring	a	versioning scheme  Let's	imagine	we	have	to	serve	the	following	two	versions	of	our	RESTful Web	Service:  Version	1:	The	version	we	have	developed	so	far.	However,	we want	to	make	sure	that	the	clients	understand	that	they	are working	with	version	1,	and	therefore,	we	want	to	include	a reference	to	the	version	number	in	the	URL	for	each	HTTP request.  Version	2:	This	version	has	to	allow	clients	to	reference	the drones	resource	collection	with	the	vehicles	name	instead	of	drones. In	addition,	the	drone	categories	resource	collection	must	be accessed	with	the	vehicle-categories	name	instead	of	drone-categories. We	also	want	to	make	sure	that	the	clients	understand	that	they	are working	with	version	2,	and	therefore,	we	want	to	include	a reference	to	the	version	number	in	the	URL	for	each	HTTP request.  The	difference	between	the	second	and	the	first	version	will	be	minimal because	we	want	to	keep	the	example	simple.	In	this	case,	we	will	take advantage	of	the	previously	explained	NamespaceVersioning	class	to	configure a	URL	path	versioning	scheme.  Make	sure	you	quit	the	Django's	development	server.	Remember	that	you just	need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	command	prompt	window	in   which	it	is	running.  We	will	make	the	necessary	changes	to	configure	the	usage	of	the NameSpaceVersioning	class	as	the	default	versioning	class	for	our	RESTful Web	Service.	Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that	declares module-level	variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for	the restful01	project.	We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings	file. Add	the	highlighted	lines	to	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	following lines	show	the	new	declaration	of	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	code file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_02	folder	in	the restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{	 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':	 				'drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound',	 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4,	 				'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS':	 	 								'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',	 								'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',	 								'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES':	 	 								'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',	 								'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES':	 	 								'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',	 								'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',	 				 ,	 				'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES':	{	 								'anon':	'3 hour',	 								'user':	'10 hour',	 								'drones':	'20 hour',	 								'pilots':	'15 hour',	 				}	 				'DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS':		 								'rest_framework.versioning.NamespaceVersioning',	 }	  We	added	a	value	for	the	DEFAULT_VERSIONING_CLASS	settings	key	to	configure the	default	versioning	class	that	we	want	to	use.	As	happened	whenever we	added	values	for	settings	keys,	the	new	configuration	will	be	applied	to   all	the	views	as	a	global	setting	that	we	are	able	to	override	if	necessary	in specific	classes.  Create	a	new	sub-folder	named	v2	within	the	restful01 drones	folder  restful01\drones	in	Windows .	This	new	folder	will	be	the	baseline	for	the specific	code	required	for	version	2	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service.  Go	to	the	recently	created	restful01 drones v2	folder	and	create	a	new	file named	views.py.	Write	the	following	code	in	this	new	file.	The	following lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	creates	the	new	ApiRootVersion2	class declared	as	a	subclass	of	the	generics.GenericAPIView	class.	The	code	file	for the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_02	folder	in	the restful01 drones v2 views.py	file.  from	rest_framework	import	generics	 from	rest_framework.response	import	Response	 from	rest_framework.reverse	import	reverse	 from	drones	import	views	 	 	 class	ApiRootVersion2 generics.GenericAPIView :	 				name	=	'api-root'	 				def	get self,	request,	*args,	**kwargs :	 								return	Response {	 												'vehicle-categories':	reverse views.DroneCategoryList.name,	request=request ,	 												'vehicles':	reverse views.DroneList.name,	request=request ,	 												'pilots':	reverse views.PilotList.name,	request=request ,	 												'competitions':	reverse views.CompetitionList.name,	request=request 	 												} 	  The	ApiRootVersion2	class	is	a	subclass	of	the rest_framework.generics.GenericAPIView	class	and	declares	the	get	method.	As we	learned	in	Chapter	6,	Working	with	Advanced	Relationships	and Serialization,	the	GenericAPIView	class	is	the	base	class	for	all	the	generic views	we	have	been	working	with.	We	will	make	the	Django	REST framework	use	this	class	instead	of	the	ApiRoot	class	when	the	requests work	with	version	2.  The	ApiRootVersion2	class	defines	the	get	method	that	returns	a	Response	object   with	key value	pairs	of	strings	that	provide	a	descriptive	name	for	the	view and	its	URL,	generated	with	the	rest_framework.reverse.reverse	function.	This URL	resolver	function	returns	a	fully	qualified	URL	for	the	view. Whenever	we	call	the	reverse	function,	we	include	the	request	value	for	the request	argument.	It	is	very	important	to	do	this	in	order	to	make	sure	that the	NameSpaceVersioning	class	can	work	as	expected	to	configure	the versioning	scheme.  In	this	case,	the	response	defines	keys	named	'vehicle-categories'	and 'vehicles'	instead	of	the	'drone-cagories'	and	'drones'	keys	that	are	included in	the	views.py	file,	in	the	ApiRoot	class	that	will	be	used	for	version	1.  Now,	go	to	the	recently	created	restful01 drones v2	folder	and	create	a	new file	named	urls.py.	Write	the	following	code	in	this	new	file.	The	following lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	declares	the	urlpatterns	array.	The	lines that	are	different	compared	to	the	first	version	are	highlighted.	The	code file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_09_02	folder	in	the restful01 drones v2 urls.py	file.  from	django.conf.urls	import	url	 from	drones	import	views	 from	drones.v2	import	views	as	views_v2	 	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	 				url r'^vehicle-categories $',		 								views.DroneCategoryList.as_view  ,		 								name=views.DroneCategoryList.name ,	 				url r'^vehicle-categories  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.DroneCategoryDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.DroneCategoryDetail.name ,	 				url r'^vehicles $',		 								views.DroneList.as_view  ,	 								name=views.DroneList.name ,	 				url r'^vehicles  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.DroneDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.DroneDetail.name ,	 				url r'^pilots $',		 								views.PilotList.as_view  ,	 								name=views.PilotList.name ,	 				url r'^pilots  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.PilotDetail.as_view  ,	   								name=views.PilotDetail.name ,	 				url r'^competitions $',		 								views.CompetitionList.as_view  ,	 								name=views.CompetitionList.name ,	 				url r'^competitions  ?P [0-9]+ $',		 								views.CompetitionDetail.as_view  ,	 								name=views.CompetitionDetail.name ,	 				url r'^$',	 								views_v2.ApiRootVersion2.as_view  ,	 								name=views_v2.ApiRootVersion2.name ,	 ]	  The	previous	code	defines	the	URL	patterns	that	specify	the	regular expressions	that	have	to	be	matched	in	the	request	to	run	a	specific	method for	a	class-based	view	defined	in	the	original	version	of	the	views.py	file. We	want	version	2	to	use	vehicle-categories	and	vehicles	instead	of	drone- categories	and	drones.	However,	we	won't	make	changes	in	the	serializer, and	therefore,	we	will	only	change	the	URL	that	the	clients	must	use	to make	requests	related	to	drone	categories	and	drones.  Now,	we	have	to	replace	the	code	in	the	urls.py	file	in	the	restful01 restful01 folder,	specifically,	the	restful01 restful01 urls.py	file.	The	file	defines	the root	URL	configurations,	and	therefore,	we	must	include	the	URL	patterns for	the	two	versions	declared	in	the	restful01 drones urls.py	and	in	the restful01 drones v2 urls.py.	The	following	lines	show	the	new	code	for	the restful01 restful01 urls.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in the	hillar_django_restful_09_02	folder,	in	the	restful01 restful01 urls.py	file.  from	django.conf.urls	import	url,	include	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	 				url r'^v1 ',	include 'drones.urls',	namespace='v1'  ,	 				url r'^v1 api-auth ',	include 'rest_framework.urls',	namespace='rest_framework_v1'  ,	 				url r'^v2 ',	include 'drones.v2.urls',	namespace='v2'  ,	 				url r'^v2 api-auth ',	include 'rest_framework.urls',	namespace='rest_framework_v2'  ,	 ]	  Whenever	a	URL	starts	with	v1 ,	the	url	patterns	defined	for	the	previous version	will	be	used	and	the	namespace	will	be	set	to	'v1'.	Whenever	a	URL   starts	with	v2 ,	the	url	patterns	defined	for	version	2	will	be	used	and	the namespace	will	be	set	to	'v2'.	We	want	the	browsable	API	to	display	the log	in	and	log	out	views	for	the	two	versions,	and	therefore,	we	included the	necessary	code	to	include	the	definitions	included	in	rest_framework.urls for	each	of	the	versions,	with	different	namespaces.	This	way,	we	will	be able	to	easily	test	the	two	versions	with	the	browsable	API	and	the configured	authentication.   Running	tests	to	check	that versioning	works	as	expected  Now,	we	can	launch	Django's	development	server	to	compose	and	send HTTP	requests	to	understand	how	the	configured	versioning	scheme works.	Execute	any	of	the	following	two	commands	based	on	your	needs to	access	the	API	in	other	devices	or	computers	connected	to	your	LAN. Remember	that	we	analyzed	the	difference	between	them	in	Chapter 3,	Creating	API	Views,	in	the	Launching	Django's	development	server section.  				python	manage.py	runserver 				python	manage.py	runserver	0.0.0.0:8000  After	we	run	any	of	the	previous	commands,	the	development	server	will start	listening	at	port	8000.  Now,	we	will	compose	and	send	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	retrieve	the	first page	of	the	drone	categories	by	working	with	the	first	version	of	our RESTful	Web	Service:  				http	:8000 v1 drone-categories   The	following	is	the	equivalent	curl	command:  				curl	-iX	GET	localhost:8000 v1 drone-categories   The	previous	commands	will	compose	and	send	the	following	HTTP request:	GET	http:  localhost:8000 v1 drone-categories .	The	request	URL	starts   with	v1 	after	the	domain	and	the	port	number	 http:  localhost:8000  ,	and therefore,	it	will	match	the	'^v1 '	regular	expression	and	will	test	the regular	expressions	defined	in	the	restful01 drones urls.py	file	and	will	work with	a	namespace	equal	to	'v1'.	Then,	the	URL	without	the	version	prefix  'v1 ' 	will	match	the	'drone-categories $'regular	expression	and	run	the	get method	for	the	views.DroneCategoryList	class-based	view.  The	NamespaceVersioning	class	makes	sure	that	the	rendered	URLs	include	the appropriate	version	prefix	in	the	response.	The	following	lines	show	a sample	response	for	the	HTTP	request,	with	the	first	and	only	page	of drone	categories.	Notice	that	the	URLs	for	the	drones	list	for	each category	include	the	version	prefix.	In	addition,	the	value	of	the	url	key	for each	drone	category	includes	the	version	prefix.

Developing	and	maintaining	multiple	versions	of	a	RESTful Web	Service	is	an	extremely	complex	task	that	requires	a	lot of	planning.	We	must	take	into	account	the	different versioning	schemes	that	the	Django	REST	framework provides	out	of	the	box	to	make	our	job	simpler.	However,	it is	always	very	important	to	avoid	making	things	more complex	than	necessary.	We	should	keep	any	versioning   scheme	as	simple	as	possible	and	we	must	make	sure	that	we continue	to	provide	RESTful	Web	Services	with	easily identifiable	resources	and	resource	collections	in	the	URLs.   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly:  1.	 The	rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle	class:  1.	 Limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	a	specific	user	can	make and	applies	to	both	authenticated	and	non-authenticated users  2.	 Limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	a	specific	user	can	make  and	applies	only	to	authenticated	users  3.	 Limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	a	specific	user	can	make  and	applies	only	to	non-authenticated	users  2.	 Which	of	the	following	settings	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary  specifies	the	global	setting	with	a	tuple	of	string	whose	values indicate	the	classes	that	we	want	to	use	for	throttling	rules:  1.	 'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES' 2.	 'GLOBAL_THROTTLE_CLASSES' 3.	 'REST_FRAMEWORK_THROTTLE_CLASSES'  3.	 Which	of	the	following	settings	key	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary  specifies	a	dictionary	with	the	default	throttle	rates:  1.	 'GLOBAL_THROTTLE_RATES'   2.	 'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES' 3.	 'REST_FRAMEWORK_THROTTLE_RATES'  4.	 The	rest_framework.throttling.ScopedRateThrottle	class:  1.	 Limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	an	anonymous	user	can  make  2.	 Limits	the	rate	of	requests	that	a	specific	user	can	make 3.	 Limits	the	rate	of	requests	for	specific	parts	of	the  RESTful	Web	Service	identified	with	the	value	assigned to	the	throttle_scope	property  5.	 The	rest_framework.versioning.NamespaceVersioning	class	configures	a  versioning	scheme	known	as:  1.	 Query	parameter	versioning	or	request	parameter  versioning  2.	 Media	type	versioning,	content	negotiation	versioning	or  accept	header	versioning  3.	 URI	versioning	or	URL	path	versioning  	  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	understood	the	importance	of	throttling	rules	and	how we	can	combine	them	with	authentication	and	permissions	in	Django,	the Django	REST	framework	and	RESTful	Web	Services.	We	analyzed	the throttling	classes	included	in	the	Django	REST	framework	out	of	the	box.  We	followed	the	necessary	steps	to	configure	many	throttling	policies	in the	Django	REST	framework.	We	worked	with	global	and	scope-related settings.	Then,	we	used	command-line	tools	to	compose	and	send	many requests	to	test	how	the	throttling	rules	worked.  We	understood	versioning	classes	and	we	configured	a	URL	path versioning	scheme	to	allow	us	to	work	with	two	versions	of	our	RESTful Web	Service.	We	used	command-line	tools	and	the	browsable	API	to understand	the	differences	between	the	two	versions.  Now	that	we	can	combine	throttling	rules,	authentication	and	permission policies	with	versioning	schemes,	it	is	time	to	explore	other	features offered	by	the	Django	REST	framework	and	third-party	packages	to improve	our	RESTful	Web	Service	and	automate	tests.	We	will	cover these	topics	in	the	next	chapter.   Automating	Tests  In	this	chapter,	we	will	add	some	automated	testing	to	our	RESTful	Web Services	and	we	will	execute	the	tests	within	a	test	database.	We	won't cover	all	the	tests	that	we	should	write	for	our	complex	RESTful	Web Service.	However,	we	will	follow	the	first	steps	and	we	will	gain	an understanding	of:  Getting	ready	for	unit	testing	with	pytest  Writing	unit	tests	for	a	RESTful	Web	Service  Discovering	and	running	unit	tests	with	pytest  Writing	new	unit	tests	to	improve	tests'	code	coverage  Running	new	unit	tests   Getting	ready	for	unit	testing with	pytest  So	far,	we	have	been	writing	code	to	add	features	to	our	RESTful	Web Service	and	configuring	many	settings	for	the	Django	REST	framework. We	used	command-line	and	GUI	tools	to	understand	how	all	the	pieces worked	together	and	to	check	the	results	of	diverse	HTTP	requests.	Now, we	will	write	unit	tests	that	will	allow	us	to	make	sure	that	our	RESTful Web	Service	will	work	as	expected.	Before	we	can	start	writing	unit	tests, it	is	necessary	to	install	many	additional	packages	in	our	virtual environment.	Make	sure	you	quit	Django's	development	server.	Remember that	you	just	need	to	press	Ctrl	+	C	in	the	terminal	or	go	to	the	Command Prompt	window	in	which	it	is	running.	First,	we	will	make	some	changes to	work	with	a	single	version	of	our	RESTful	Web	Service.  This	way,	it	will	be	easier	to	focus	on	tests	for	a	single	version	in	our examples.	Replace	the	code	in	the	urls.py	file	in	the	restful01 restful01 folder,	specifically,	the	restful01 restful01 urls.py	file.	The	file	defines	the root	URL	configurations,	and	therefore,	we	want	to	include	only	the	URL patterns	for	the	first	version	of	our	web	service.	The	code	file	for	the sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder,	in	the restful01 restful01 urls.py	file:  from	django.conf.urls	import	url,	include	 	 urlpatterns	=	[	 				url r'^',	include 'drones.urls'  ,	 				url r'^api-auth ',	include 'rest_framework.urls'  	 ]  We	will	install	the	following	Python	packages	in	our	virtual	environment:   pytest:	This	is	a	very	popular	Python	unit	test	framework	that makes	testing	easy	and	reduces	boilerplate	code  pytest-django:	This	pytest	plugin	allows	us	to	easily	use	and configure	the	features	provided	by	pytest	in	our	Django	tests  Notice	that	we	won't	be	working	with	Django's	manage.pytest command.	We	will	work	with	pytest	instead.	However,	in	case you	don't	want	to	work	with	pytest,	most	of	the	things	you	will learn	can	be	easily	adapted	to	any	other	test	framework.	In fact,	the	code	is	compatible	with	nose	in	case	you	decide	to use	the	most	common,	yet	a	bit	outdated,	configuration	for testing	with	the	Django	REST	framework.	Nowadays,	pytest is	the	preferred	unit	test	framework	for	Python. Run	the	following	command	to	install	the	pytest	package:  pip	install	pytest  The	last	lines	for	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	pytest	package	and	its required	packages	have	been	successfully	installed:  We	just	need	to	run	the	following	command	to	install	the	pytest-django package:  pip	install	pytest-django  The	last	lines	for	the	output	will	indicate	that	the	pytest-django	package	has been	successfully	installed:  Installing	collected	packages:	attrs,	pluggy,	six,	py,	pytest		Running	setup.py	install	for	pluggy	...	done   Installing	collected	packages:	pytest-django Successfully	installed	pytest-django-3.1.2  Now,	go	to	the	restful01	folder	that	contains	the	manage.py	file	and	create	a new	file	named	pytest.ini.	Write	the	following	code	in	this	new	file.	The following	lines	show	the	code	for	this	file	that	specifies	the	Django settings	module	 restful01.settings 	and	the	pattern	that	pytest	will	use	to locate	the	Python	files,	the	declare	tests.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the	restful01 pytest.ini file:  [pytest]	 DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE	=	restful01.settings	 python_files	=	tests.py	test_*.py	*_tests.py	  Whenever	we	execute	pytest	to	run	tests,	the	test	runner	will	check	the following	to	find	test	definitions:  Python	files	named	tests.py  Python	files	whose	name	starts	with	the	test_	prefix  Python	files	whose	name	ends	with	the	_tests	suffix  In	Chapter	9,	Applying	Throttling	Rules	and	Versioning	Management,	we configured	throttling	rules	for	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	We	want	to	run our	tests	considering	the	throttling	rules.	In	fact,	we	should	write	tests	to make	sure	that	the	throttling	rules	are	working	OK.	We	will	be	running requests	many	times,	and	therefore,	the	low	values	we	used	for	the throttling	rules	might	complicate	running	all	the	requests	required	by	our tests.	Hence,	we	will	increase	the	values	for	the	throttling	rules	to	simplify our	testing	samples.	Open	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file	that declares	module-level	variables	that	define	the	configuration	of	Django	for the	restful01	project.	We	will	make	some	changes	to	this	Django	settings file.	Replace	the	code	for	the	highlighted	lines	included	in	the	REST_FRAMEWORK   dictionary.	The	following	lines	show	the	new	declaration	of	the REST_FRAMEWORK	dictionary.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the	restful01 restful01 settings.py	file:  REST_FRAMEWORK	=	{	 				'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':	 				'drones.custompagination.LimitOffsetPaginationWithUpperBound',	 				'PAGE_SIZE':	4,	 				'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS':	 	 								'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',	 								'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',	 								'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES':	 	 								'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',	 								'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',	 								 ,	 				'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES':	 	 								'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',	 								'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',	 				 ,	 				'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES':	{	 								'anon':	'300 hour',	 								'user':	'100 hour',	 								'drones':	'200 hour',	 								'pilots':	'150 hour',	 				}	 }	  We	increased	the	number	of	requests	per	hour	that	we	can	execute	in	each of	the	throttling	rates	configurations.	This	way,	we	will	be	able	to	run	our tests	without	issues.  In	this	case,	we	are	using	the	same	settings	file	for	our	tests in	order	to	avoid	running	additional	steps	and	repeating	test settings.	However,	in	most	cases,	we	would	create	a	specific Django	configuration	file	for	testing.   Writing	unit	tests	for	a	RESTful Web	Service  Now,	we	will	write	our	first	round	of	unit	tests	related	to	the	drone category	class	based	views:	DroneCategoryList	and	DroneCategoryDetail.	Open the	existing	restful01 drones tests.py	file	and	replace	the	existing	code	with the	following	lines	that	declare	many	import	statements	and	the DroneCategoryTests	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file:  from	django.utils.http	import	urlencode	 from	django.core.urlresolvers	import	reverse	 from	rest_framework	import	status	 from	rest_framework.test	import	APITestCase	 from	drones.models	import	DroneCategory	 from	drones	import	views	 	 	 class	DroneCategoryTests APITestCase :	 				def	post_drone_category self,	name :	 								url	=	reverse views.DroneCategoryList.name 	 								data	=	{'name':	name}	 								response	=	self.client.post url,	data,	format='json' 	 								return	response	 	 				def	test_post_and_get_drone_category self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	can	create	a	new	DroneCategory	and	then	retrieve	it	 								"""	 								new_drone_category_name	=	'Hexacopter'	 								response	=	self.post_drone_category new_drone_category_name 	 								print "PK	{0}".format DroneCategory.objects.get  .pk  	 								assert	response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_201_CREATED	 								assert	DroneCategory.objects.count  	==	1	 								assert	DroneCategory.objects.get  .name	==	new_drone_category_name	  The	DroneCategoryTests	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	rest_framework.test.APITestCase   superclass	and	declares	the	post_drone_category	method	that	receives	the desired	name	for	the	new	drone	category	as	an	argument.  This	method	builds	the	URL	and	the	data	dictionary	to	compose	and	send an	HTTP	POST	request	to	the	view	associated	with	the views.DroneCategoryList.name	name	 dronecategory-list 	and	returns	the	response generated	by	this	request.  The	code	uses	the	self.client	attribute	to	access	the	APIClient instance	that	allows	us	to	easily	compose	and	send	HTTP requests	for	testing	our	RESTful	Web	Service	that	uses	the Django	REST	framework.	For	this	test,	the	code	calls	the	post method	with	the	built	url,	the	data	dictionary,	and	the	desired format	for	the	data:	'json'.  Many	test	methods	will	call	the	post_drone_category	method	to	create	a	new drone	category	and	then	compose	and	send	other	HTTP	requests	to	the RESTful	Web	Service.	For	example,	we	will	need	a	drone	category	to	post a	new	drone.  The	test_post_and_get_drone_category	method	tests	whether	we	can	create	a new	DroneCategory	and	then	retrieve	it.	The	method	calls	the post_drone_category	method	and	then	calls	assert	many	times	to	check	for	the following	expected	results:  1.	 The	status_code	attribute	for	the	response	is	equal	to	HTTP	201  Created	 status.HTTP_201_CREATED   2.	 The	total	number	of	DroneCategory	objects	retrieved	from	the  database	is	1  3.	 The	value	of	the	name	attribute	for	the	retrieved	DroneCategory	object is	equal	to	the	new_drone_category_name	variable	passed	as	a	parameter to	the	post_drone_category	method  The	previously	coded	tests	make	sure	that	we	can	create	a	new	drone category	with	the	RESTful	Web	Service,	it	is	persisted	in	the	database,	and   the	serializer	does	its	job	as	expected.	The	drone	category	is	a	very	simple entity	because	it	just	has	a	primary	key	and	a	name.	Now,	we	will	add more	test	methods	that	will	allow	us	to	cover	more	scenarios	related	to drone	categories.  Add	the	test_post_existing_drone_category_name	method	to	the	recently	created DroneCategoryTests	class	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file:  				def	test_post_existing_drone_category_name self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	cannot	create	a	DroneCategory	with	an	existing	name	 								"""	 								url	=	reverse views.DroneCategoryList.name 	 								new_drone_category_name	=	'Duplicated	Copter'	 								data	=	{'name':	new_drone_category_name}	 								response1	=	self.post_drone_category new_drone_category_name 	 								assert	response1.status_code	==	status.HTTP_201_CREATED	 								response2	=	self.post_drone_category new_drone_category_name 	 								print response2 	 								assert	response2.status_code	==	status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST	  The	new	method	tests	whether	the	unique	constraint	for	the	drone	category name	works	as	expected	and	doesn't	make	it	possible	for	us	to	create	two drone	categories	with	the	same	name.	The	second	time	we	compose	and send	an	HTTP	POST	request	with	a	duplicate	drone	name,	we	must	receive an	HTTP	400	Bad	Request	status	code	 status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST .  Add	the	test_filter_drone_category_by_name	method	to	the	DroneCategoryTests class	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file:  				def	test_filter_drone_category_by_name self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	can	filter	a	drone	category	by	name	 								"""	 								drone_category_name1	=	'Hexacopter'	   								self.post_drone_category drone_category_name1 	 								drone_caregory_name2	=	'Octocopter'	 								self.post_drone_category drone_caregory_name2 	 								filter_by_name	=	{	'name'	:	drone_category_name1	}	 								url	=	'{0}?{1}'.format 	 												reverse views.DroneCategoryList.name ,	 												urlencode filter_by_name  	 								print url 	 								response	=	self.client.get url,	format='json' 	 								print response 	 								assert	response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_200_OK	 									Make	sure	we	receive	only	one	element	in	the	response	 								assert	response.data['count']	==	1	 								assert	response.data['results'][0]['name']	==	 								drone_category_name1	  The	new	method	tests	whether	we	can	filter	a	drone	category	by	name,	and therefore,	checks	the	usage	of	the	filter	field	we	have	configured	for	the DroneCategoryList	class-based	view.	The	code	creates	two	drone	categories and	then	calls	the	django.utils.http.urlencode	function	to	build	an	encoded URL	from	the	filter_by_name	dictionary.	This	dictionary	includes	the	field name	as	a	key	and	the	desired	string	for	the	field	as	a	value.	In	this	case, drone_category_name1	is	equal	to	'Hexacopter',	and	therefore,	the	encoded	URL saved	in	the	url	variable	will	be	'name=Hexacopter'.  After	the	call	to	self.client.get	with	the	built	URL	to	retrieve	the	filtered list	of	drone	categories,	the	method	verifies	the	data	included	in	the response	JSON	body	by	inspecting	the	data	attribute	for	the	response.	The second	line	that	calls	assert	checks	whether	the	value	for	count	is	equal	to	1 and	the	next	lines	verify	whether	the	name	key	for	the	first	element	in	the results	array	is	equal	to	the	value	hold	in	the	drone_category_name1	variable. The	code	is	easy	to	read	and	understand.  Add	the	test_get_drone_categories_collection	method	to	the	DroneCategoryTests class	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file:  				def	test_get_drone_categories_collection self :	 								"""	   								Ensure	we	can	retrieve	the	drone	categories	collection	 								"""	 								new_drone_category_name	=	'Super	Copter'	 								self.post_drone_category new_drone_category_name 	 								url	=	reverse views.DroneCategoryList.name 	 								response	=	self.client.get url,	format='json' 	 								assert	response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_200_OK	 									Make	sure	we	receive	only	one	element	in	the	response	 								assert	response.data['count']	==	1	 								assert	response.data['results'][0]['name']	==	 								new_drone_category_name	  The	method	tests	whether	we	can	retrieve	the	drone	categories	collection. First,	the	code	creates	a	new	drone	category	and	then	makes	an	HTTP	GET request	to	retrieve	the	drones	collection.	The	lines	that	call	assert	check that	the	results	include	the	only	created	and	persisted	drone	and	that	its name	is	equal	to	the	name	used	for	the	call	to	the	POST	method	to	create	the new	drone	category.  Add	the	test_update_drone_category	method	to	the	DroneCategoryTests	class	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file:  				def	test_update_drone_category self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	can	update	a	single	field	for	a	drone	category	 								"""	 								drone_category_name	=	'Category	Initial	Name'	 								response	=	self.post_drone_category drone_category_name 	 								url	=	reverse 	 												views.DroneCategoryDetail.name,		 												None,		 												{response.data['pk']} 	 								updated_drone_category_name	=	'Updated	Name'	 								data	=	{'name':	updated_drone_category_name}	 								patch_response	=	self.client.patch url,	data,	format='json' 	 								assert	patch_response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_200_OK	 								assert	patch_response.data['name']	==	 								updated_drone_category_name  The	new	method	tests	whether	we	can	update	a	single	field	for	a	drone   category.	First,	the	code	creates	a	new	drone	category	and	then	makes	an HTTP	PATCH	request	to	update	the	name	field	for	the	previously	persisted drone	category.	The	lines	that	call	assert	check	that	the	returned	status	code is	HTTP	200	OK	and	that	the	value	of	the	name	key	in	the	response	body	is	equal to	the	new	name	that	we	specified	in	the	HTTP	PATCH	request.  Add	the	test_get_drone_category	method	to	the	DroneCategoryTests	class	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_10_01	folder	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file:  				def	test_get_drone_category self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	can	get	a	single	drone	category	by	id	 								"""	 								drone_category_name	=	'Easy	to	retrieve'	 								response	=	self.post_drone_category drone_category_name 	 								url	=	reverse 	 												views.DroneCategoryDetail.name,		 												None,		 												{response.data['pk']} 	 								get_response	=	self.client.get url,	format='json' 	 								assert	get_response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_200_OK	 								assert	get_response.data['name']	==	drone_category_name	  The	new	method	tests	whether	we	can	retrieve	a	single	category	with	an HTTP	GET	request.	First,	the	code	creates	a	new	drone	category	and	then makes	an	HTTP	GET	request	to	retrieve	the	previously	persisted	drone category.	The	lines	that	call	assert	check	that	the	returned	status	code	is HTTP	200	OK	and	that	the	value	of	the	name	key	in	the	response	body	is	equal to	the	name	that	we	specified	in	the	HTTP	POST	request	that	created	the drone	category.  Each	test	method	that	requires	a	specific	condition	in	the	database	must execute	all	the	necessary	code	to	generate	the	required	data.	For	example, in	order	to	update	the	name	for	an	existing	drone	category,	it	was necessary	to	create	a	new	drone	category	before	making	the	HTTP	PATCH request	to	update	it.	Pytest	and	the	Django	REST	framework	will	execute each	test	method	without	data	from	the	previously	executed	test	methods in	the	database,	that	is,	each	test	will	run	with	a	database	cleansed	of	data   from	the	previous	tests.   Discovering	and	running	unit tests	with	pytest  Now,	go	to	the	restful01	folder	that	contains	the	manage.py	file,	with	the virtual	environment	activated,	and	run	the	following	command:  pytest  The	pytest	command	and	the	Django	REST	framework	will	perform	the following	actions:  1.	 Create	a	clean	test	database	name	test_drones. 2.	 Run	all	the	migrations	required	for	the	database. 3.	 Discover	the	tests	that	have	to	be	executed	based	on	the	settings  specified	in	the	pytest.ini	file.  4.	 Run	all	the	methods	whose	name	starts	with	the	test_	prefix	in	the  DroneCategoryTests	class	and	display	the	results.	We	declared	this class	in	the	tests.py	file	and	it	matches	the	pattern	specified	for	the python_files	setting	in	the	pytest.ini	file.  5.	 Drop	the	test	database	named	test_drones.  It	is	very	important	to	know	that	the	tests	won't	make changes	to	the	database	we	have	been	using	when	working with	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	Notice	that	the	test	database name	is	test_drones	and	the	database	name	that	we	have	been using	with	Django's	development	server	is	drones.  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	sample	output	generated	by	the	pytest   command:  pytest	-v  The	output	indicated	that	the	test	runner	collected	and	executed	six	tests and	all	of	them	passed.	However,	the	output	didn't	show	the	names	of	the tests	that	passed.	Hence,	we	will	run	pytest	again	with	the	-v	option	to increase	verbosity.	Run	the	following	command:  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	sample	output	generated	by	the	pytest command	with	the	increased	verbosity:  We	enabled	verbose	mode,	and	therefore,	the	new	output	displayed	the	full test	names.	Pytest	displays	the	following	information	for	each	discovered and	executed	test:	the	Python	file	that	defines	it,	the	class	name,	and	the method,	such	as	the	following	line:  drones tests.py::DroneCategoryTests::test_filter_drone_category_by_name	PASSED	[16%]   The	line	indicates	that	the	test_filter_drone_category_by_name	test	method declared	in	the	DroneCategoryTests	class,	within	the	drones tests.py	module	has been	executed,	passed,	and	its	execution	represents	16%	of	the	discovered tests.  The	verbose	mode	makes	it	possible	to	know	the	specific	tests that	have	been	executed.  Some	of	the	test	methods	include	calls	to	the	print	function.	By	default, pytest	captures	both	the	stdout	and	stderr	and	only	shows	the	captured content	for	the	tests	that	fail.	Sometimes,	it	is	useful	for	us	to	see	the results	of	calls	to	the	print	function	while	pytest	runs	the	tests.	We	will	run pytest	again	with	-s	option	combined	with	the	-v	option	to	disable	capturing and	increase	verbosity.	Notice	that	the	-s	option	is	a	shortcut	that	is equivalent	to	the	-capture=no	option.	Run	the	following	command:  pytest	-vs  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	sample	output	for	the	previous command:   The	new	output	displayed	the	results	of	each	call	to	the	print	function.	In addition,	we	will	notice	that	there	are	two	messages	displayed	that	are printed	by	Django,	one	line	before	the	first	test	runs	and	another	line	after the	last	test	finishes	its	execution:  Creating	test	database	for	alias	'default'...Destroying	test	database	for	alias	'default'...  These	messages	indicate	that	Django	created	the	test	database	before running	the	first	test	and	drops	the	database	after	all	the	tests	have	been executed.  The	test_filter_drone_category_by_name	test	method	declared	in	the DroneCategoryTests	class	has	the	following	two	calls	to	the	print	function:  url	=	'{0}?{1}'.format 	 				reverse views.DroneCategoryList.name ,	 				urlencode filter_by_name  	 print url 	 response	=	self.client.get url,	format='json' 	 print response 	  The	previous	output	shows	the	results	of	the	two	calls	to	the	print	function. First,	the	tests	output	display	the	value	of	the	url	variable	with	the composed	URL	and	then	the	output	shows	the	response	of	the	call	to self.client.get	as	a	string:  In	this	case,	the	output	is	clear.	However,	as	you	might	notice	in	the previous	screenshot,	the	output	generated	by	the	other	print	statements	is shown	at	the	right-hand	side	of	the	test	method	name	that	was	executed and	it	is	not	so	clear.	Hence,	whenever	we	want	to	provide	helpful	output for	tests,	it	is	always	a	good	idea	to	make	sure	we	start	with	a	new	line  'n' 	and	provide	some	context	for	the	output	we	are	displaying.  drones tests.py::DroneCategoryTests::test_filter_drone_category_by_name	Creating	test	database	for	alias	'default'...   Now,	we	will	replace	the	line	that	calls	the	print	function	in	the test_post_and_get_drone_category	method	for	the	DroneCategoryTests	class	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_10_02	folder	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The replaced	line	is	highlighted:  				def	test_post_and_get_drone_category self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	can	create	a	new	DroneCategory	and	then	retrieve	it	 								"""	 								new_drone_category_name	=	'Hexacopter'	 								response	=	self.post_drone_category new_drone_category_name 	 								print "nPK	{0}n".format DroneCategory.objects.get  .pk  	 								assert	response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_201_CREATED	 								assert	DroneCategory.objects.count  	==	1	 								assert	DroneCategory.objects.get  .name	==	 								new_drone_category_name	  Run	the	following	command	to	execute	pytest	again	with	the	-s	and	-v options	combined:  pytest	-vs  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	sample	output	for	the	previous command:   The	edits	made	in	the	call	to	the	print	statement	that	added	a	new	line before	and	after	the	output	made	it	easier	to	read	the	output.	The	generated output	is	highlighted	in	the	previous	screenshot.	It	is	very	important	to take	this	formatting	into	account	when	working	with	pytest.   Writing	new	unit	tests	to improve	the	tests'	code coverage  Our	first	round	of	unit	tests	was	related	to	the	drone	category	class-based views:	DroneCategoryList	and	DroneCategoryDetail.	Now,	we	will	write	a	second round	of	unit	tests	related	to	the	pilot	class-based	views:	PilotList	and PilotDetail.	The	new	tests	will	be	a	bit	more	complex	because	we	will	have to	work	with	authenticated	requests.  In	Chapter	8,	Securing	the	API	with	Authentication	and	Permissions,	we configured	authentication	and	permission	policies	for	the	class-based views	that	work	with	the	Pilot	model.	We	overrode	the	values	for	the authentication_classes	and	permission_classes	class	attributes	for	the	PilotDetail and	PilotList	classes.	In	order	to	create,	read,	update,	or	delete	pilots,	we have	to	provide	an	authentication	token.	Hence,	we	will	write	tests	to make	sure	that	an	unauthenticated	request	cannot	perform	operations related	to	pilots.	In	addition,	we	want	to	make	sure	that	an	authenticated request	with	a	token	can	create	a	new	pilot	and	then	retrieve	it.  Open	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file	and	add	the	following	lines	after	the last	line	that	declares	the	imports,	before	the	declaration	of	the DroneCategoryTests	class:  from	drones.models	import	Pilot	 from	rest_framework.authtoken.models	import	Token	 from	django.contrib.auth.models	import	User	  Add	the	following	code	to	the	existing	restful01 drones tests.py	file	to	create the	new	PilotTests	class.	The	code	file	for	the	sample	is	included	in	the hillar_django_restful_10_02	folder	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file:   class	PilotTests APITestCase :				 				def	post_pilot self,	name,	gender,	races_count :	 								url	=	reverse views.PilotList.name 	 								print url 	 								data	=	{	 												'name':	name,	 												'gender':	gender,	 												'races_count':	races_count,	 												}	 								response	=	self.client.post url,	data,	format='json' 	 								return	response	 	 				def	create_user_and_set_token_credentials self :	 								user	=	User.objects.create_user 	 												'user01',	'user01@example.com',	'user01P4ssw0rD' 	 								token	=	Token.objects.create user=user 	 								self.client.credentials 	 												HTTP_AUTHORIZATION='Token	{0}'.format token.key  	 	 				def	test_post_and_get_pilot self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	can	create	a	new	Pilot	and	then	retrieve	it	 								Ensure	we	cannot	retrieve	the	persisted	pilot	without	a	token	 								"""	 								self.create_user_and_set_token_credentials  	 								new_pilot_name	=	'Gaston'	 								new_pilot_gender	=	Pilot.MALE	 								new_pilot_races_count	=	5	 								response	=	self.post_pilot 	 												new_pilot_name,	 												new_pilot_gender,	 												new_pilot_races_count 	 								print "nPK	{0}n".format Pilot.objects.get  .pk  	 								assert	response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_201_CREATED	 								assert	Pilot.objects.count  	==	1	 								saved_pilot	=	Pilot.objects.get  	 								assert	saved_pilot.name	==	new_pilot_name	 								assert	saved_pilot.gender	==	new_pilot_gender	 								assert	saved_pilot.races_count	==	new_pilot_races_count	 								url	=	reverse 	 												views.PilotDetail.name,		 												None,	 												{saved_pilot.pk} 	 								authorized_get_response	=	self.client.get url,	format='json' 	 								assert	authorized_get_response.status_code	==	 								status.HTTP_200_OK	 								assert	authorized_get_response.data['name']	==	new_pilot_name	 									Clean	up	credentials	 								self.client.credentials  	   								unauthorized_get_response	=	self.client.get url,	format='json' 	 								assert	unauthorized_get_response.status_code	==	 								status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED	  The	PilotTests	class	is	a	subclass	of	the	rest_framework.test.APITestCase superclass	and	declares	the	post_pilot	method	that	receives	the	desired	name and	gender	for	the	new	pilot	as	arguments.  This	method	builds	the	URL	and	the	data	dictionary	to	compose	and	send an	HTTP	POST	request	to	the	view	associated	with	the	views.PilotList.name name	 pilot-list 	and	returns	the	response	generated	by	this	request.  Many	test	methods	will	call	the	post_pilot	method	to	create	a	new	pilot	and then	compose	and	send	other	HTTP	requests	to	the	RESTful	Web	Service. Notice	that	the	post_pilot	method	doesn't	configure	authentication credentials,	and	therefore,	we	will	be	able	to	call	this	method	for unauthenticated	or	authenticated	users.	We	already	know	that unauthenticated	users	shouldn't	be	able	to	post	a	pilot,	and	a	test	will	call this	method	without	a	token	and	make	sure	no	pilot	is	persisted	in	the database.  The	create_user_and_set_token_credentials	method	executes	the	following actions:  Creates	a	Django	user	with	a	call	to	the	User.objects.create_user method.  Creates	a	token	for	the	previously	created	Django	user	with	a	call to	the	Token.objects.create	method.  Includes	the	token	generated	for	the	Django	user	as	the	value	for the	Authorization	HTTP	header	key	with	the	'Token	'	string	as	a prefix	for	the	token.	The	last	line	calls	the	self.client.credentials method	to	set	the	generated	HTTP	header	as	the	value	for	the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION	named	argument.   Remember	that	the	self.client	attribute	allows	us	to	access the	APIClient	instance.  Whenever	a	test	wants	to	perform	an	HTTP	request	with	a	token,	the	code will	call	the	create_user_and_set_token_credentials	method.	In	order	to	clean	up the	credentials	configured	for	the	APIClient	instance	saved	in	self.client,	it is	necessary	to	call	the	self.client.credentials  	method	without	arguments.  The	test_post_and_get_pilot	method	tests	the	following	path:  1.	 We	can	create	a	new	Pilot	with	an	HTTP	POST	request	that	has	an  appropriate	authentication	token  2.	 We	can	retrieve	the	recently	created	Pilot	with	an	HTTP	GET  request	that	has	an	appropriate	authentication	token 3.	 We	cannot	retrieve	the	recently	created	Pilot	with	an  unauthenticated	HTTP	GET	request  The	code	calls	the	create_user_and_set_token_credentials	method	and	then	calls the	post_pilot	method.	Then,	the	code	calls	assert	many	times	to	check	for the	following	expected	results:  1.	 The	status_code	attribute	for	the	response	is	equal	to	HTTP	201  Created	 status.HTTP_201_CREATED   2.	 The	total	number	of	Pilot	objects	retrieved	from	the	database	is	1  3.	 The	value	of	the	name,	gender,	and	races_count	attributes	for	the  retrieved	Pilot	object	is	equal	to	the	values	passed	as	parameters	to the	post_pilot	method  Then,	the	code	calls	the	self.client.get	with	the	built	URL	to	retrieve	the previously	persisted	pilot.	This	request	will	use	the	same	credentials   applied	to	the	HTTP	POST	request,	and	therefore,	the	new	request	is authenticated	by	a	valid	token.	The	method	verifies	the	data	included	in the	response	JSON	body	by	inspecting	the	data	attribute	for	the	response. The	code	calls	assert	twice	to	check	for	the	following	expected	results:  1.	 The	status_code	attribute	for	the	response	is	equal	to	HTTP	201  Created	 status.HTTP_201_CREATED   2.	 The	value	of	the	name	key	in	the	response	body	is	equal	to	the	name  that	we	specified	in	the	HTTP	POST	request  Then,	the	code	calls	the	self.client.credentials	method	without	arguments	to clean	up	the	credentials	and	calls	the	self.client.get	method	again	with	the same	built	URL,	this	time,	without	a	token.	Finally,	the	code	calls	assert	to check	that	the	status_code	attribute	for	the	response	is	equal	to	HTTP	401 Unauthorized	 status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED .  The	previously	coded	test	makes	sure	that	we	can	create	a	new	pilot	with the	RESTful	Web	Service	and	the	appropriate	authentication	requirement we	configured,	the	pilot	is	persisted	in	the	database,	and	the	serializer	does its	job	as	expected.	In	addition,	unauthenticated	users	aren't	able	to	access a	pilot.  Add	the	test_try_to_post_pilot_without_token	method	to	the	recently	created DroneCategoryTests	class	in	the	restful01 drones tests.py	file.	The	code	file	for the	sample	is	included	in	the	hillar_django_restful_10_02	folder	in	the restful01 drones tests.py	file:  				def	test_try_to_post_pilot_without_token self :	 								"""	 								Ensure	we	cannot	create	a	pilot	without	a	token	 								"""	 								new_pilot_name	=	'Unauthorized	Pilot'	 								new_pilot_gender	=	Pilot.MALE	 								new_pilot_races_count	=	5	 								response	=	self.post_pilot 	 												new_pilot_name,	 												new_pilot_gender,	   												new_pilot_races_count 	 								print response 	 								print Pilot.objects.count   	 								assert	response.status_code	==	status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED	 								assert	Pilot.objects.count  	==	0  The	new	method	tests	that	the	combination	of	permission	and authentication	classes	configured	for	the	PilotList	class	doesn't	make	it possible	for	an	unauthenticated	HTTP	POST	request	to	create	a	pilot.	The code	calls	the	post_pilot	method	without	configuring	any	credentials,	and therefore	the	request	runs	without	authentication.	Then,	the	code	calls assert	twice	to	check	for	the	following	expected	results:  1.	 The	status_code	attribute	for	the	response	is	equal	to	HTTP	401  Unauthorized	 status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED   2.	 The	total	number	of	Pilot	objects	retrieved	from	the	database	is	0 because	the	received	data	to	create	a	new	pilot	wasn't	processed  We	have	increased	the	scenarios	covered	by	our	tests.	We	should	write more	tests	related	to	pilots.	However,	with	all	the	examples	provided,	you will	have	the	necessary	information	to	write	all	the	tests	required	to	make sure	that	each	new	version	of	a	RESTful	Web	Service	developed	with Django	and	the	Django	REST	framework	works	as	expected.   Running	unit	tests	again	with pytest  Now,	go	to	the	restful01	folder	that	contains	the	manage.py	file,	with	the virtual	environment	activated,	and	run	the	following	command	to	execute pytest	again	with	the	-v	option	to	increase	verbosity:  pytest	-v  In	this	case,	pytest	will	run	all	the	methods	whose	name	starts	with	the test_	prefix	in	both	the	DroneCategoryTests	and	PilotTests	classes	and	display the	results.  The	following	screenshot	shows	a	sample	output	generated	for	the	new execution	of	the	pytest	command	with	the	increased	verbosity:  We	enabled	verbose	mode	again,	and	therefore,	the	output	displayed	the full	test	names	that	the	test_post_and_get_pilot	and test_try_to_post_pilot_without_token	test	methods	passed.   We	should	continue	writing	tests	related	to	pilots,	drone	categories, drones,	and	competitions.	It	is	extremely	important	that	we	cover	all	the scenarios	for	our	RESTful	Web	Service.	Automated	tests	will	make	it possible	for	us	to	make	sure	that	each	new	version	of	our	RESTful	Web Service	will	work	as	expected	after	it	is	deployed	to	production.  We	built	RESTful	Web	Services	with	Django,	the	Django	REST framework,	and	Python	3.6.	We	learned	to	design	a	RESTful	Web	Service from	scratch,	starting	with	the	requirements,	and	to	run	some	of	the necessary	tests	to	make	sure	our	web	service	runs	as	expected.	We	learned to	work	with	different	command-line	and	GUI	tools	to	make	our development	tests	easy.	We	understood	many	features	included	in	the Django	REST	framework	and	how	to	configure	them.  Now,	we	are	ready	to	create	RESTful	Web	Services	with	Django	and	the Django	REST	framework.	We	will	definitely	need	to	dive	deep	into additional	features,	packages,	and	configurations.	We	definitely	have	a great	baseline	to	develop	our	next	RESTful	Web	Service	with	the	most versatile	programming	language:	Python.   Test	your	knowledge  Let's	see	whether	you	can	answer	the	following	questions	correctly.  1.	 In	a	subclass	of	APITestCase,	self.client	is:  1.	 The	APITestCase	instance	that	allows	us	to	easily	compose  and	send	HTTP	requests	for	testing  2.	 The	APITestClient	instance	that	allows	us	to	easily	compose  and	send	HTTP	requests	for	testing  3.

Which	of	the	following	methods	for	self.client	in	a	method	within  a	subclass	of	APITestCase	allows	us	to	make	an	HTTP	POST request?  1.	 http_post 2.	 make_http_post_request   4.	 Which	of	the	following	methods	for	self.client	in	a	method	within a	subclass	of	APITestCase	allows	us	to	make	an	HTTP	GET	request?  5.	 Which	of	the	following	methods	for	self.client	in	a	method	within  a	subclass	of	APITestCase	allows	us	to	make	an	HTTP	PATCH request?  3.	 post  1.	 http_get 2.	 make_http_get_request 3.	 get  1.	 http_patch 2.	 make_http_patch_request 3.	 patch  	  The	rights	answers	are	included	in	the	Appendix,	Solutions.   Summary  In	this	chapter,	we	learned	to	write	unit	tests	for	our	RESTful	Web Service.	We	installed	the	necessary	packages	and	made	the	appropriate configurations	to	work	with	the	modern	and	popular	pytest	unit	test framework.	Then,	we	wrote	our	first	round	of	unit	tests	for	the	RESTful Web	Service	related	to	different	scenarios	with	drone	categories.  We	worked	with	the	different	options	for	the	pytest	command	to	discover and	run	unit	tests	in	the	default	mode,	the	increase	verbosity	mode,	and	the disable	capture	mode.	We	understood	how	to	combine	pytest	with	the testing	classed	provided	by	the	Django	REST	framework.  Finally,	we	wrote	additional	unit	tests	for	the	RESTful	Web	Service	related to	different	scenarios	with	pilots	and	the	token	authentication	requirements for	specific	requests.	We	are	able	to	continue	adding	tests	for	our	RESTful Web	Service	with	all	the	things	we	have	learned.  Now,	it	is	your	turn.

Django is a Python web framework that makes the web development process very easy. It reduces the amount of trivial code, which simplifies the creation of web applications and results in faster development. It is very powerful and a great choice for creating RESTful web services. If you are a Python developer and want to efficiently create RESTful web services with Django for your apps, then this is the right book for you. The book starts off by showing you how to install and configure the environment, required software, and tools to create RESTful web services with Django and the Django REST framework. We then move on to working with advanced serialization and migrations to interact with SQLite and non-SQL data sources. We will use the features included in the Django REST framework to improve our simple web service. Further, we will create API views to process diverse HTTP requests on objects, go through relationships and hyperlinked API management, and then discover the necessary steps to include security and permissions related to data models and APIs. We will also apply throttling rules and run tests to check that versioning works as expected. Next we will run automated tests to improve code coverage
