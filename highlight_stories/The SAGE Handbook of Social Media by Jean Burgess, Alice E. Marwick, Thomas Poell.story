By social media technologies, we mean those  digital  platforms,  services  and  apps  built  around  the  convergence  of  content  sharing,  public  communication,  and  interpersonal  connection.  These  technologies  have  been  widely but unequally taken up by the world’s  diverse  populations,  and  have  an  influence  on all of our lives through pervasive ‘social  media logics’ like connectivity  van Dijck &  Poell, 2013 .  Through its logic of convergence  Burgess,  2017 , the social media paradigm brings with  it entanglements between commercial, public  and personal contexts. Well-known platforms  like Twitter, Facebook and WeChat, once seen  as mere sources of teenage distraction, have  become  embedded  into  the  ICT  infrastruc- tures of corporations, societal organizations,   and  public  institutions.  Especially  with  the  rapid  uptake  of  mobile  media,  these  plat- forms,  their  uses  and  their  politics  are  also  increasingly embedded in our everyday life,  work and relationships at a very personal and  embodied level.  The  social  media  paradigm  is  also  shap- ing the interests and knowledge practices of  media and communication studies. From the  mid to the late 1990s, proto-social media like  social  networking  sites  and  content  sharing  platforms  from Friendster to MySpace  were  objects  of  burgeoning  interest  in  internet  studies,  media  studies  and  communication  studies. Since then, social media has become  a recognizable field of study within these dis- ciplines. As of 2015, this sub-field even has  its own journal, Social Media + Society  also  published by Sage ,1 as well as a number of  edited collections, and now this Handbook.  At the same time, research on social media  has  transitioned  from  being  a  niche  topic  within  internet  studies  to  a  site  of  transfor- mation  and  methodological  innovation  for    2  more  mainstream  social  scientists.  Through  its  embedding  across  areas  of  society  like  government  and  politics,  health  and  medi- cine, and education, social media is becom- ing an area of interest for researchers focused  on those topics, even if they have not previ- ously been particularly interested in studying  the internet. In the field of political science,  for  example,  social  media  is  unavoidable  because  of  the  way  it  is  now  playing  such  an obvious and contentious role in electoral  politics,  protest,  and  political  journalism.  In  public  and  sexual  health  research,  it  is  increasingly impossible to understand sexual  cultures and practices without understanding  the role of mobile dating apps. And because  social  media  is  understood  as  important  for  networking and the dissemination of knowl- edge  for  practitioners  in  almost  every  pro- fession   including  science ,  most  college  graduates  and  doctoral  students  are  encour- aged to develop social media literacy in the  course of their education.  Most recently, as part of a broader ‘data- fication’ of society and a turn to digital meth- ods,  the  social  media  paradigm  has  driven  significant  change  in  how  humanities  and  social science research is done. This shift has  been  the  focus  of  a  number  of  stand-alone  articles  and  edited  volumes   see,  for  exam- ple,  Snee,  Hine,  &  Morey,  2015 .  Cross- disciplinary  journals,  such  as  Big  Data  and  Society, have been launched to deal with the  dual challenges posed by the datafication of  society  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  datafica- tion of social science research on the other.   These  shifts  are  felt  particularly  acutely   in the domain of social media research because   the discourses, interactions and relationships  of  social  media  users  are  themselves  moni- tored, collected and ordered as data that can  be  aggregated,  analysed  and  monetized  by  social  media  platforms,  while  the  mecha- nisms  for  doing  so  in  turn  provide  access  to  research  data  for  social  scientists.  This  datafication of social media use has attracted  computational  and  information  scientists  to  the  data-driven  analysis  of  social  networks   and behaviour; and it has attracted media and  communications  researchers  to  questions  around  the  political  economy  and  ethics  of  social  media’s  data  cultures   see,  for  exam- ple, Langlois, Redden, & Elmer, 2015 .  So, then, social media as a field of research  is a potentially dynamic and diverse ‘trading  zone’  Rieder & Röhle, 2012  among many  different  social  science  and  humanities  dis- ciplines,  and  even  in  Science,  Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics  STEM . As a  common object of study that affords a wide  variety of research questions and approaches,  it presents us with exciting opportunities for  discovery,  dialogue  and  transdisciplinary  collaboration,  as  well  as  the  need  for  criti- cal  reflection  on  issues  like  privacy,  ethics  and the political aspects of data-mining. We  hope this book will bring new and established  voices from a range of disciplinary perspec- tives into this conversation.  scope and approach  Given the rapid pace of popular technological  developments,  terminology  is  a  constantly- shifting target. When interpersonal communi- cation  scholars  and  information  scientists  turned  their  attention  to  e-mail,  forums  and  bulletin boards in the early 1980s  Rice, 1980;  Kerr  &  Hiltz,  1982 ,  they  used  the  term   ‘computer-mediated communication’  CMC  to   describe, as Joseph Walther  1992: 52  puts it,  ‘synchronous or asynchronous electronic mail  and computer conferencing, by which senders  encode in text messages that are relayed from  senders’ computer to receivers’’. While inter- net communication is no longer entirely tex- tual  and  no  longer  requires  a  user  to  sit  at  a  computer terminal or use a modem to ‘log on’,  many  of  today’s  social  media  practices  were  first identified and explored by CMC scholars,  such as the use of emoticons  or emoji , troll- ing  and  flaming.  We  might  best  describe   CMC today as a method rooted in interper- sonal communication studies. Nancy Baym’s    editors’ introduCtion  3  popular  book  Personal  Connections  in  the  Digital Age  now in its second edition, 2015   takes this approach among several to analyse  contemporary social technologies.  But why social media? ‘New media’, once  a useful way to distinguish internet commu- nication  from  broadcast  media,  now  seems  as  dated  as  ‘cyberspace’  or  ‘the  informa- tion  superhighway’,  and  firmly  rooted  in  the  1990s.  ‘Digital  media’  is  more  precise,  but  covers  an  enormous  scope,  from  video  games  to  internet  radio  to  e-books.  ‘Web  2.0’, was used in the mid-2000s as a catch- all for a group of nascent social technologies,  including  Wikipedia,  MySpace  and  Flickr.  However, the ‘2.0’ never referred to any par- ticular  technological  development.  It  was  a  rhetorical move by entrepreneurs and venture  capitalists  to  attract  investment  to  the  inter- net after the dot-com crash, and disappeared  quickly,  leaving  unread  business  books  and  failed startups in its wake  Marwick, 2013 .  ‘Social  media’,  the  current  term  of  art,  describes  digital  internet  technologies  that  facilitate  communication  and  collaboration  by users. One might say that the term social  media is so broad as to be useless, but because  such  technologies  develop  so  quickly,  this  definition is expansive and vague by design.  Similarly,  scholars  often  operationalize  ‘social  media’  as  ‘Facebook  and  Twitter’.  While  Facebook  is  still  the  largest  social  media site in the world, and Twitter is popu- lar to study since vast volumes of tweets are  accessible to researchers, ‘social media’ must  also  encompass  social  networking  sites  like  VK  and  LinkedIn;  photo  and  video  sharing  apps  like  Instagram  and  Snapchat;  music- sharing  sites  like  Soundcloud;  video  sites  like YouTube; blogs; texting apps like Signal,  LINE  and  What’sApp;  forums  like  Reddit  and  4chan;  location-based  technologies  like  Foursquare  and  NextDoor;  groupware  like  Slack  and  Discord;  and  annotation  and  aggregation  sites  like  Pinterest  and  Genius   and dozens more by the time you read this ,  all  of  which  may  be  mobile  apps,  websites  or  desktop  software.  A  single  one  of  these   apps and platforms can encompass thousands  of  different  functions,  communities  and  practices.  In  this  book,  rather  than  focusing  on  any  one   or  two,  or  three   technologies,  our  contributors  examine  a  range  of  com- mon practices, beliefs and concerns that they  observe across social media technologies.  Since  social  media  is  an  object  of  study,  rather  than  a  single  discipline  with  a  meth- odological  history  and  agreed-upon  canon,  this  volume  is  by  necessity  interdiscipli- nary.  Contributors  come  from  communica- tion,  media  studies,  journalism,  information  science,  linguistics,  science  and  technol- ogy  studies,  sociology,  and  gender  studies,  to  name  but  a  few.  While  interdisciplinar- ity  is  often  championed  by  universities  and  in  graduate  classes,  in  practice  it  is  much  harder  to  achieve.  Ethnographers  trained  in  media  anthropology,  fan  studies  or  audi- ence  studies  may  disagree  with  anthro- pologists  on  what  ‘counts’  as  ethnography.  Computational  social  scientists  may  clash  with digital humanists over what constitutes  data.  A  cultural  theorist  might  dislike  the  writing  style  of  a  communication  scholar’s  paper   and  vice  versa! ,  while  a  sociologist  might throw up their hands at how an infor- mation scientist thinks about class. However,  what the contributors to this volume have in  common is that they draw widely from differ- ent traditions and disciplines. Because social  media combines the social with the technical,  developing  a  full  understanding  of  the  use  and  effects  of  social  media  requires  a  pro- miscuous  attitude  towards  scholarship.  We  ask our readers to suspend, to the best of their  abilities,  disciplinary  prejudices  when  read- ing chapters in this Handbook from scholars  outside their home field.  Much  research  and  scholarship  on  social  media  focuses  on  the  US  context.  This  is  unsurprising  given  the  Anglo-centric  bias  across  adjacent  academic  fields,  including  media studies  Thussu, 2009 , cultural studies   Shome, 2009  and social computing  Philip,  Irani, & Dourish, 2012, and compounded by  the  fact  that  many  of  the  most-researched    4  social media technologies originate in Silicon  Valley  and  were  popularized  in  the  USA,  including  Facebook,  Twitter,  YouTube  and  Snapchat.  Unfortunately,  this  focus  has  lim- ited  our  understanding  of  social  media  tech- nologies.  Not  only  are  practices  local  to  English-speaking  contexts  often  generalized  far beyond what is rational, studies are often  limited to WEIRD populations – those resid- ing  in Western,  educated,  industrialized,  rich  and  developed  countries   Henrich,  Heine,  &  Norenzayan, 2010  – which are by no means  representative. Such myopia also misses many  significant  social  media  sites.  Russia’s  most  popular  social  network,  for  instance,  is  VK   a  mix  of  Facebook  and  filesharing ,  while  China’s internet giants Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent  and Sina have more than 2 billion users. We  have attempted to include, whenever possible,  studies and perspectives from other contexts.  De  Seta’s  chapter  on  trolling,  for  instance,  looks  at  how  trolling  in  China  complicates  definitions and models of the practice drawn  from English-speaking sites and cultures.  Finally,  we  must  note  the  centrality  of  mobile  communication  to  the  social  media  experience for most people. Worldwide, 50%  of overall internet traffic is mobile, and 88%  of  social  media  users  access  social  media  sites and apps using mobile phones  Kemp,  2017 . Many of today’s most popular social  media  apps,  including  WhatsApp,  WeChat  and  Instagram,  were  designed  for  mobiles  and  have  limited  functionality  on  the  desk- top.  Overwhelmingly,  smartphone  owners  use  their  phones  to  access  social  media;  to  decouple  social  media  from  mobile  use  is  impossible.  Thus,  our  assumptions  about  how  and  where  people  access  social  media,  in what contexts, and with who, must move  beyond desktop and laptop usage.  media platforms and technologies that exist,  the broad range of social media practices that  can be observed across the globe, and the dif- ferent  ways  in  which  these  practices  and  technologies  have  been  studied.  While  the  Handbook  overall  still  skews  towards  an  Anglo-centric  focus  –  reflecting  both  our  own institutional contexts and the state of the  field – it is structured so that the global and  cultural diversity of platforms, practices and  approaches  is  more  evident.  Our  diverse  international  contributors  have  made  sus- tained efforts to include examples from com- paratively less-studied parts of the world, and  they sketch avenues for future research into  new  platforms  and  practices.  In  this  regard,  the Handbook can be read as an invitation to  further broaden the scope of social media as  a multi-disciplinary field of study.  The  first  section  of  the  book  is  devoted  to histories and pre-histories, prompting the  reader to shift their attention from the ‘pre- sent’, ‘latest’ and ‘most current’ to the com- plex lineages of contemporary social media.  The subsequent section highlights the diverse  repertoire of available approaches and meth- ods,  from  ethnography  and  digital  methods  to  political  economic  and  historical  analy- sis. The  following  two  sections  zoom  in  on  the  key  technologies,  business  models,  cul- tures and practices that define social media.  Although  this  inventory  is  by  no  means  comprehensive,  the  chapters  offer  inspiring  examples of how social media can be empiri- cally and conceptually explored in new ways.  The  final  section  on  social  and  economic  domains features chapters that examine how  social  media  become  involved  in  various  professional  domains,  including  marketing,  education and journalism, providing starting  points for further research on the role of these  media in public life.  sTrucTure and conTenTs  Histories and Pre-Histories  In developing this Handbook, we have tried  to  do  justice  to  the  wide  variety  of  social   One of the potential weaknesses of research  on  social  media  is  a  lack  of  attention  to  its    editors’ introduCtion  5  histories. The traps lie both in potential igno- rance  of  previous  work  done  on  a  specific  area of interest in other disciplines  as when  researchers study online deliberation from a  political science perspective without making  themselves  aware  of  the  relevant  work  already  done  by  communications  scholars   and in being interested only in contemporary  phenomena,  without  recognizing  now  those  phenomena  represent  both  continuity  and  change in the relationships between societies  and communications technologies. The chap- ters in this section will help to build a more  in-depth understanding of both these issues.  The opening chapter, ‘Pushing Back: Social  Media  as  an  Evolutionary  Phenomenon’  by  John  Hartley,  constitutes  a  genuine  tour  de  force.  Replacing  the  ‘transmission’  model  of  communication  with  a  ‘translation’  or  semiotic  model,  Hartley  provocatively  sug- gests that ‘mass communication’ and ‘social  media’  predate  the  Neolithic  Revolution.  From  his  long-term  perspective,  he  under- stands social media as group-forming institu- tions of inclusion and exclusion. As such they  can be considered as the prime directive for  humans, since, in Hartley’s words, ‘culture- made  groups  are  the  survival  vehicles  for  knowledge and technology’.  With  the  second  chapter,  the  Handbook  moves into the more familiar terrain of bul- letin board systems  BBS . Aaron Delwiche  traces the rise and fall of these systems, from  their beginnings as technologies for computer  enthusiasts  to  their  mainstream  acceptance.   The  chapter  closes  with  a  discussion  of  the  collapse of the BBS scene, when the privati- zation and commercialization of the internet  took off.  Shifting  the  focus  to  East  Asia,  Mark  McLelland,  Haiqing Yu  and  Gerard  Goggin  examine the historical development of social  media in China and Japan in Chapter 3. These  histories  illustrate  that  there  is  not  one  uni- versal  trajectory  along  which  social  media  develop, but that language, place and culture  continue to shape local and regional patterns  of  internet  development.  This  conclusion  is   also  reached  by  Michael  Stevenson  in  the  closing  chapter  of  the  histories  section,  in  which he stresses that web history shows us  that social media were not ‘inevitable’. The  chapter traces the lineage of social media to  older ideas, values, media forms and technol- ogies,  especially  from  the  early  web  of  the  1990s.  Considering  this  history,  Stevenson  argues  that  utopian  ‘visions’  of  the  web’s  purpose and nature should not simply be dis- missed, but understood as productive forces  that set expectations, prompt community for- mation,  create  inequalities  of  attention  and  steer financial speculation.  Approaches and Methods  The study of social media is methodologically  diverse,  dynamic  and  challenging.  This  sec- tion brings together chapters that elaborate on  the  underpinning  knowledge  structures,  approaches and techniques of particular social  media  research  methods  –  from  the  concep- tual to the qualitative and the computational.  In the first chapter of this section, Richard  Rogers  elaborates  on  Digital  Methods  –  that is, critical humanities methods that use  the  internet’s  affordances  to  study  the  very  socio-cultural phenomena that they mediate –   and  updates  them  for  a  social  media-  dominated Web.  His  chapter  brings  to  light  the  specific  challenges  of  cross-platform  analysis in a context where the characteristics  of  often proprietary  platforms play such a  central role in mediating social and cultural  life,  and  it  suggests  a  number  of  practical  approaches and techniques that can be used in   such work.  The  existence  and  availability  of  large- scale sets of social media data have attracted  immense interest in computational social sci- ence, or the use of computational methods to  test social theories. In their chapter, Jeremy  Foote, Aaron Shaw and Benjamin Mako Hill  demonstrate  such  methods  using  a  dataset  of  social  media  scholarship.  Their  analysis  finds  that  while  early  social  media  research    6  used  social  network  analysis  and  quantita- tive  methods,  the  most  cited  and  influential  work has come from marketing and medical  research.  In  his  chapter  ‘Digital  Discourse:  Locating  Language  in  New Social  Media’,  Crispin  Thurlow  traces  the  foundations  of  digital discourse analysis in sociolinguistics  and critical discourse studies.  Nick  Couldry  and  Jannis  Kallinikos  approach  the  study  of  social  media  through  one  of  sociology’s  most  fundamental  con- cepts  –  ontology.  They  rehearse  the  ques- tion of what social media even are, and what   can be understood to be their constitutive ele- ments or objects of study. They conclude that,  rather than taking such matters at face value,  social media research needs to trace the polit- ical  logics  of  social  media’s  infrastructures,  processes  and  interactions,  in  order  to  pin  down the ‘evasive sociality’ of social media,  and  to  empirically  observe  and  critiques  its  operations and incentives.  In  addressing  social  media’s  recent  ‘vis- ual  turn’,  Simon  Faulkner,  Farida  Vis  and  Francesco  D’Orazio  survey  the  available  approaches  to  the  analysis  of  social  media  images, dividing them into three categories:  large-scale   computational   image  analy- sis;  analysis  at  multiple  scales  using  mixed  methods; and close qualitative analysis. They  illustrate how these approaches can be com- bined through their own case study of image- sharing  practices:  the  visual  representation  on Twitter of Alan Kurdi’s death.  Jolynna  Sinanan  and  Tom  McDonald  tackle the role of ethnography in social media  research. Ethnography is treated here as the  defining  practice  and  output  of  anthropol- ogy. Through a survey of the literature on its  application in media anthropology as well as  reflections on their own work within the inter- national  Why  We  Post  project,  the  authors  consider  how  ethnography  is  being  used  to  shed light on everyday social media practice,  and how social media are shifting the practice  of ethnography within Anthropology.  It  is  one  thing  to  argue  that  social  media  researchers must attend to the history of the   platforms  and  practices  they  study,  but  it  is  quite another to figure out where to find the  archives,  tools  and  approaches  to  do  so  in  practice. In his chapter, pioneering web his- torian  Niels  Brügger  reflects  on  the  general  challenge of archiving and understanding the  ephemeral web, and the acute challenges of  doing so in an appified and proprietary social  media-dominated environment, leaving the  reader with useful pointers for moving forward  with this kind of work.  Siva Vaidhyanathan  uses  the  example  of  Facebook  Basics  in  India  to  discuss  politi- cal  economy  approaches  to  social  media.  Considering  research  in  critical  theory,   Marxist-influenced Critical Political Economy  and  cultural  studies,  he  suggests  a  model  of  scholarship  rooted  in  the  work  of  Thorstein  Veblen  that  engages  with  the  complexity  of  labour,  use,  technology,  states  and  cor- porations  that  mark  today’s  social  media  landscape.  Platforms, Technologies and  Business Models  One of the distinctive challenges of approach- ing  social  media  as  an  object  of  study  is   finding  ways  to  account  for  the  role  of   platforms – complex assemblages of technol- ogies,  business  models  and  user  practices  –  in mediating and being shaped by the specific  and diverse forms of interaction and commu- nication  that  they  support.  This  section  is  devoted  to  chapters  that  critically  explore  these issues, each bringing together political  economy and software or technology studies  in particular combinations in order to do so. Taina  Bucher  and  Anne  Helmond  lead  off  the  section  by  bringing  software  studies  and internet studies together in an advanced  concept  of  affordances  that  can  account  for  the  materiality  and  the  medium  specificity  of social media platforms. In doing so, they  revisit  older  debates  about  the  concept,  and  refresh  it  through  close  forensic  analyses  of  specific  features  and  their  uses.  Tarleton    editors’ introduCtion  7  Gillespie extends his popular work on the pol- itics of platforms to examine how platforms  both govern and are governed. Platforms are  governed by information policy, such as the  United  States’  ‘safe  harbor  provision’  for  information  intermediaries.  But  Gillespie  also  shows  how  platforms  themselves  gov- ern, in terms of content regulation and behav- iour policing. By examining the complexities  of  moderation  and  enforcement,  Gillespie  delves  into  questions  of  accountability  and  responsibility in social media.  Each of the next three chapters deals with  some  aspect  of  the  political  economy  of  social media in the context of a globalizing  world.  Rowan  Wilken  provides  a  detailed  account  of  the  interconnected  global  busi- ness interests operating at every layer of the  mobile app economy through which so many  people experience social media. The chapter  covers major US players like Apple, Google,  Facebook and Twitter, but then considers the  different  dynamics  of  other  major  markets,  such as China and Russia.  Jack  Qiu  elaborates  a  multi-dimensional  model  that  describes  the  various  forms  of  labour  operating  in  and  through  social  media’s  material  and  symbolic  economies,  focusing particularly on the Chinese context –   where  much  of  the  hardware  that  powers  the social media paradigm is produced, and  where  distinctive  formations  of  class  con- sciousness,  creativity  and  political  protest  are expressed through social media platforms  like QQ and WeChat.  In  her  chapter  ‘Silicon  Valley  and  the  Social Media Industry’, Alice Marwick con- siders  the  influence  of  the  United  States’  dominant  cultures  of  production   especially  the  ‘Californian  Ideology’  associated  with  Silicon Valley  on social media and on global  markets  and  their  local  economies.  She  describes  how  Silicon Valley  functions  as  a  kind of global imaginary, articulating to vari- ous local contexts through their own start-up  and entrepreneurial scenes.  Robert Gehl’s chapter, ‘Alternative Social  Media:  From  Critique  to  Code’,  examines   alternative  social  media  platforms,  those  developed  outside  systems  of  hegemonic  corporate  social  media.  Gehl  argues  that  sites like Ello and Diaspora represent the pri- mary critiques of social media, from political  economy  surveillance, user data collection   to technical infrastructures  algorithms, cen- tralization  and cultural practices  real-name  policies and context collapse .  Cultures and Practices  In  this  section  our  authors  trace  a  range  of  themes  that  cross  platforms,  cultures  and,  indeed, internet eras. Each chapter represents  both a substantive body of scholarship and is  focused on a topic of great popular interest or  public concern.  In  ‘Personal  Connection  and  Relational  Maintenance  in  Social  Media  Use’,  Kelly  Quinn and Zizi Papacharissi use an interper- sonal  communication  approach  to  examine  how social media affects how social relation- ships are formed and developed, focusing on  friendship.  Rihannon  Bury’s  chapter  draws  from her new Television 2.0 project to look  at fandom, and how sites that enable people  to share content, including YouTube, peer-to- peer file sharing networks and social media  platforms, are changing viewing and partici- patory  fan  practices.  Her  rich  ethnographic  evidence  shows  the  complex  relationship  between broadcast and social media for both  self-professed fans and more casual viewers. The  next  two  chapters  draw  from  par- ticipatory cultural practices that can be both  playful  and  problematic.  Gabriele  de  Seta  provides a comprehensive look at ‘troll stud- ies’  so  far,  and  draws  from  his  research  on  Chinese  digital  culture  to  examine  the  cul- tural  situatedness  of  the  term.  Arguing  for  analysis  of  digital  practice  that  draws  from  individual and reflexive experience, de Seta  shows that while trolling per se does not exist  in the Chinese context, similar practices are  articulated locally, affected by national media  ecologies  and  platform-specific  norms  and    8  interactions. Similarly, Kate Miltner’s exami- nation of memes serves both as a ‘primer on  internet memes and internet meme research’  and a deft overview of how memes function  and  differ  in  democratic  and  authoritarian  regimes, as play, activism, and as part of cap- italist political economy.  Jill  Walker  Rettberg’s  beautifully-writ- ten  chapter,  ‘Self-Representation  in  Social  Media’,  untangles  two  concepts  that  are  often  muddled  together:  self-representation  and self-presentation. Using a Kendall Jenner  Instagram  photo  as  an  object  to  think  with,  Rettberg  unpacks  how  scholars  from  each  tradition  might  approach  such  an  artefact.  She  traces  visual,  written  and  quantitative  self-representation,  from  diaries  and  self- portraits to the Big Data era of the self made  of metrics and numbers. Kath Albury’s essay  on  ‘Sexual  Expression  in  Social  Media’  takes  a  similar  historical  approach  to  argue  that sexual expression has been part of inter- net  communication  since  early  textual  chat  rooms  and  discussion  groups.  The  popular- ity of social media has made such expression  much  more  visible,  promoting  freedom  of  expression  for  sexual  minorities,  but  rais- ing  ethical  concerns  around  young  people,  LGBT individuals and BDSM practitioners –   and often social anxiety as well.  In  the  last  essay  in  the  section,  surveil- lance studies scholar Daniel Trottier skilfully  traces the difference between examining pri- vacy  and  surveillance  with  regard  to  social  media. He presents an overview of contem- porary  surveillance  practices  that  occur  on  social media, focusing on how these practices  force a reconsideration of privacy as a legal  and cultural value.  Social and Economic Domains  Over  the  past  decade,  social  media  have  become  increasingly  involved  in  a  wide  range of public domains, from journalism to  politics and from education to health care. In  the  process,  social  media  practices  have   transformed  as  well  as  clashed  with  estab- lished institutional routines. The chapters in  this  section  examine  how  the  rise  of  social  media  provides  new  opportunities,  but  also  introduces  new  sets  of  problems  in  key  public domains.  The  section’s  first  chapter  by  Michael  Serazio and Brooke Duffy focuses on social  media  marketing.  After  a  useful  inventory  of  the  threats  to  the  traditional  advertis- ing  model,  the  chapter  explores  how  social  media, such as Facebook and Instagram, are  employed  in  the  marketing  triad  of  earned,  owned  and  paid  media.  Such  social  media  marketing  strategies  entail  activating  online  influencers, soliciting user-generated content  and circulating promotional content.  Alfred  Hermida,  in  turn,  examines  the  integration  of  social  media  in  journalistic  practices.  He  describes  these  media  as  ‘the  land of opportunity’ for news organizations  and journalists, as they allow for an expan- sion  of  audiences  and  enable  new  forms  of  engagement.  At  the  same  time,  he  notices  that they force these organizations and jour- nalists  to  operate  outside  the  framework  of  institutional  journalism,  creating  new  ten- sions  as  journalistic  norms  and  established  representations  of  the  news  are  challenged.  In  the  following  chapter, Terry  Flew  makes  very similar observations in his investigation  of  the  evolving  relationship  between  social  media and the cultural and creative industries.  He  maintains  that  the  use  of  social  media  expands reach and engagement, undermines  traditional  creative  business  models  and  leads to new types of model. Services such as  Netflix that revolve around algorithm-based  decision-making are a prominent example of  this trend.  Shifting the focus from the creative indus- tries  to  politics,  Jessica  Baldwin-Philippi  contends that the adoption of digital tools in  political  campaigns  has  led  to  strategic  and  technical  innovation.  Investigating  social  media  campaign  strategies  in  the  years  fol- lowing  the  revolutionary  2008  US  elec- tions,  she  discusses  the   often  unintended     editors’ introduCtion  9  consequences  of  opening  up  campaigns  to  public  feedback  and  of  giving  analytics  an  increasingly  central  role  in  campaigning.  Remaining  within  the  political  realm,  the  subsequent  chapter  by  Thomas  Poell  and  José  van  Dijck  analyses  how  the  intensive  use  of  social  media  transforms  the  organi- zation  and  communication  of  protest.  In  critical dialogue with the idea that traditional  modes  of  organization  in  social  movements  are being replaced by platform-enabled mass  user  activity,  the  authors  argue  that  leader- ship and collective identities continue to play  a  vital  role  in  online  contention.  Moreover,  they  show  that  social  media  do  not  simply  enable  mass  protest  activity,  but  fundamen- tally shape it.  Deborah  Lupton,  a  leading  authority  on  digital  technologies  and  health  tracking,  contributes a chapter on ‘Lively Data, Social  Fitness  and  Biovalue’.  The  chapter  investi- gates the connections between practices and  discourses of self-tracking and those of social  media. Developing the concept of ‘social fit- ness’,  Lupton  explores  the  new  forms  of  value  that  personal  health  and  medical  data  have  generated  and  she  critical  reflects  on  the political implications of the ideal of the  socially fit citizen.  The  two  final  chapters  of  the  Handbook  focus  on  the  world  of  education  and  aca- demia.  Through  case  studies  on  AltSchool  and Massive Open Online Courses  MOOCs ,  such as those offered by Coursera, José van  Dijck  and  Thomas  Poell  investigate  how  learning metrics and predictive analytics are  employed  in  primary  and  higher  education.  They also examine the new business models  developed  by  such  corporations.  The  chap- ter  closes  with  a  discussion  of  the  impact  of  platformization  on  education  as  a  public  good.  In  the  last  chapter  of  the  Handbook,  Katrin  Weller  and  Isabella  Peters  study  the  use  of  social  media  in  scholarly  communi- cation.  Rather  than  focusing  on  differences  and  transformations,  the  authors  show  the  similarities  between  traditional  and  social  media  forms  of  scholarly  communication.   They point out that in both cases researchers   leave  traces  through  which  impact  can  be  measured  and  identity  shaped. The chapter discusses how altmetrics  enable such understanding of scholarly social  media communication.  the  researcher’s   Note   1   See http:  journals.sagepub.com home sms  references  Baym,  N.

PART I Histories and Pre-histories   This page intentionally left blank   1 Pushing Back: Social Media as an  Evolutionary Phenomenon  J o h n   H a r t l e y  A universe comes into being when a space is sev- ered into two. A unity is defined. The description,  invention  and  manipulation  of  unities  is  at  the  base of all scientific inquiry.  Humberto Maturana  and Fransisco Varela, 1980: 73   social media: long sTory!  Taking the long-term view, ‘social media’ is  a tautology. All media are social. All sociality  is  mediated.  Pragmatically,  the  current  arrangements known as ‘social media’, which  distinguish online media from other types of  media  entertainment  and  social  networks  from  physical  ones,  are  not  geared  to  the  long-term view. It may be that most readers  who encounter this chapter are also focused  on  the  here  and  now.  However,  the  chapter  heads  in  the  opposite  direction,  out  of  the  endless  present  tense  of  social  science,  to  push back as far as possible in order to under- stand  what  it  might  mean  to  claim,  as  Zizi  Papacharissi does in the opening statement of   the  new  journal  Social  Media  and  Society   2015: 1 , that ‘we have always been social’.  If so, one methodological imperative is that  we  must  all  be  interdisciplinary  now.  We  must  find  ways  to  translate  and  enjoy  each  other’s  knowledge  and  expertise,  especially  across  polarised  disciplinary  or  ideological  boundaries. In that interdisciplinary universe,  we  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  how  we  know  what  we  know  –  to  ‘noetics’   Ong,  2012  or the science of science, even as we  deploy  methods  specific  to  a  particular  approach.  Taking  the  long  view  imposes  a  new kind of ‘discipline’, which is both com- parative   to  combine  different  perspectives   and integrative  to synthesise difference .  Let’s take Papacharissi’s ‘always’ literally,  and see where it leads, pushing back beyond  history,  even  Fernand  Braudel’s   2012   ‘extreme  long  term’   la  très  longue  durée ,  beyond  anthropology  and  even  the  confines  of H. sapiens, to a much more fundamental  level, as explored in biosemiotics: that of life  itself:   14  Semiotics, in the process of delimiting and defining  itself, has shown a noticeable trend towards a view  which states that semiosis begins where life itself  begins.  Kull, 1999: 115   In other words, ‘life’ and ‘sign’ may prove to  be  one  and  the  same  phenomenon.  It’s  not  just that ‘we’ are social and thus communica- tive, via media from language to the internet,  but also that all life is founded upon signals  communicated  in,  by  and  among  biogeo- chemical material processes, where the ‘self- creation’  and  self-organisation  of  complex  systems,  or  autopoiesis   Maturana  and  Varela,  1980:  73–123 ,  produces  discrete  entities,  bounded  by  difference-from-  environment, from molecular level upwards. If you like, you may proceed even further  back in time and in causal sequence, from bio- geochemistry  to  elementary  physics,  which  may  also  be  founded  on  communication.  Elementary particles communicate with each  other  through  ‘messenger  particles’   gravi- tons, photons, Higgs bosons, etc.  that carry  force  over  a  force  field   gravitational  field,  electromagnetic  field,  Higgs  field .  Physics  is known as the ‘fundamental’ or ‘enabling’  science  because  it  describes  mathematically  a framework of perfect communication – of  all  particles  with  all  particles  –  which  then  constructs  the  concepts  of  information  and  message, based on difference from random- ness   Hartley  and  Potts,  2016 .  Rethinking  physical reality itself in terms of communica- tion  bases  the  natural  world  –  physical  and  biological  –  not  only  on  fields  but  also  on  relations.  Traces  of  life  from  4.1  billion  years  ago  have  been  found  in Western Australia   Bell  et  al.,  2015 .  Communication  as  ‘matter- energy’ + life + sign can be illustrated with  something that emerged about halfway along  terrestrial  life’s  timeline.  About  2  billion  years  ago  Eukaryotic  organisms  appeared.  Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus; those of the  other two bio-domains, archaea and bacteria,  do not. Eukaryotes are the cellular ‘complex  systems’  from  which  we  are  all  descended,   including  algae,  plants,  fungi  and  animals.  Eukaryotes  are  quite  complex  structures,  with  nuclei  and  other  ‘organelles’  within  each cell.1 In order to constitute and maintain  themselves as entities, eukaryotic cells require  communicative relationships. Internally, cell- signalling  coordinates  the  cell’s  actions.  In  the case of multicellular eukaryotes like us,  they  must  communicate  with  other  parts  of  the same organism as well as the trillions of  microorganisms living within it, such as gut  bacteria. Externally, cells must communicate  with the environment and its biotic load.  Communication  connects  organisms  to  systemic  relations  at  much  higher  levels  of  organisation  too:  relations  of  descent  and  reproduction  in time , prey and predator  in  space , cooperation and competition  dynam- ics of change , and environmental adaptation  or niching  selection . The very constitution  of  eukaryotes   including  H.  sapiens ,  then,  is  based  on  these  communicative  relations,  internal  and  external,  which,  at  maximum,  interrelate every living organism with every  other,  present  and  past,  differentiating  life  into an evolved new ‘envelope’ of planetary  extent: the ‘biosphere’  Vernadsky, 1998; and  see Figure 1.1 .  ‘social insTincTs’  Thus  ‘social  media’  must  include  cellular  secretions  –  think  pheromones.  The  very  glimpse  of  such  possibilities  permits  an  approach to communication – the thing that  makes  the  media  into  media  and  sociality  social – that is naturalistic and scientific, but  can  include  relations,  meanings,  and  identi- ties,  deriving  its  approach  from  bioscience  not  directly  from  physics,  especially  the  model taken from the war-effort information  science  of  the  1940s  that  still  underlies  the  dominant ‘transmission’ model of communi- cation  Carey, 1989 .

This  reduces  relations  to  ‘interference’  and  ‘noise’  and  communication  individualistic  behaviour.  itself   to   As James Carey  2000  went on to warn,  such  a  model  of  science  is  better  suited  to  control than to democracy, because it replaces  communication with behaviour and uses sci- ence to manipulate that. In critiquing ‘a sci- ence  designed  to  rule  over  citizens’,  Carey  offers an alternative: a ‘science of enlighten- ment or citizenship, a science in society’. He  writes:  Science, under the dominant construction of what  science is, deeply undercuts the democratic impulse  of  journalism.  For  a  science  of  journalism  is  a  sci- ence about journalism: a science of bureaucracy, of  systems,  of  procedures,  of  management  and  of  control. It is not a science of creation and construc- tion,  a  science  of  understanding  and  common  action. A science from without cannot connect with  the creative impulse from within.  Carey, 2000: 22   We  can  now  do  better,  using  relational  models  to  develop  a  communication-based  science  of  ‘creation  and  construction’,  of  ‘understanding  and  common  action’  that  connects  with  ‘the  creative  impulse’,  devel- oped  from  interdisciplinary  contact   and  some feats of mutual translation  with evolu- tionary and complexity sciences.  The  evolutionist  Charles  Darwin   1871   called the framework of human communica- tion the ‘social instinct’.  As  humanity  advances  in  civilisation,  and  small  tribes are united into larger communities, the sim- plest  reason  would  tell  each  individual  that  they  ought  to  extend  their  social  instincts  and  sympa- thies  to  all  the  members  of  the  same  nation,  though  personally  unknown  to  them.  This  point  being once reached, there is only an artificial bar- rier  to  prevent  their  sympathies  extending  to  the  humanity of all nations and races. …  The  highest  stage  in  moral  culture  at  which  we  can  arrive,  is  when  we  recognise  that  we    16  ought to control our thoughts, and ‘Not even in  inmost thought to think again the sins that made  the past so pleasant to us’.3  Darwin, 1871, 1 3 :  100–101 4  Extending the ‘social instinct’ to non-kin and  even to unmet strangers  ‘all the members of  the same nation’  is an important move, both  for  humans  and  for  bioscience.  It  draws  attention  away  from  the  individual  and  the  so-called ‘selfish gene’ celebrated by Richard  Dawkins   1976 ,  to  focus  instead  on  the  group,  up  to  population  level   ‘all  nations  and races’ . Instead of Dawkins’ individual- istic gene-centred view of evolution, Darwin  is  pointing  to  a  culture-centred  view,  where  communicative  sociality  –  language,  rela- tionship,  identity  –  binds  groups,  via  social  media,  in  such  a  way  that  their  knowledge  and  technologies  can  be  shared,  stored  and  transmitted  through  time  and  across  space,  typically in competition with other groups.  Culture makes groups, which are the ‘sur- vival vehicles’  Pagel, 2012  for all who live  within their boundaries. This approach to cul- ture – emphasising what it is for rather than  restricting  it  to  the  products  of  professional  practitioners  –  is  elaborated  in  Hartley  and  Potts  2014: Chapter 3 , where we introduce  the concept of ‘demes’. This term for culture- made  groups  is  based  on  both  bioscience   demes = interbreeding subpopulations  and  political science  demos = citizens , to iden- tify ‘inter-knowing’ subpopulations or ‘we’- groups.  Demes  are  at  once  rule-bound  and  dynamic,  cooperative  and  competitive  –  up  to  the  point  of  destructive  conflict  between  adversarial  demes.  Within  a  deme  too,  ‘cooperation’  is  not  all  lovey-dovey,  since   H. sapiens, like previously evolved hominins  going back 2 million years, had use of lethal  hand-weapons as well as tools and, with lan- guage, to deceit as well as truth. In that situa- tion, whatever knowledge could save a group  could  also  destroy  it:  Hamlet  style,  anyone  can  secretly  murder  the  monarch  in  their  sleep and marry their consort. Since strength  alone  cannot  determine  group  leadership,   the  ‘social  media’  of  any  ‘we’-group  are  crucial to the maintenance of both trust and  scepticism,  testing  individuals’  communica- tive intentions  Tomasello, 2014  even while  telling  group-binding  stories,  building  and  breaking alliances for social coordination at  different scales, as well as extending knowl- edge  and  technology  across  increasingly  large  communities  of  non-kin  and  personal  strangers. The most ‘efficient’ evolved mech- anism  for  holding  groups  together   while  distinguishing  them  from  others   is  lan- guage and its semiotic load, such that ‘being  human’ and ‘language’ are one and the same.  As Raymond Williams put it  1977: 21 : ‘A  definition of language is always, implicitly or  explicitly, a definition of human beings in the  world’.  Thinking  about  ‘language’   group   rather than ‘behaviour’  individual  is essen- tially a systems approach to culture, and its  germ is present in Darwin.  planeTary scale  Bioscience  shares  components  with  other  evolutionary  sciences,  from  computer-  and  web-science  cybernetics  to economics and  linguistics.  It  connects  foundational  ‘sys- tems’  approaches  to  aspects  of  culture,  for  example: Niklas Luhmann  2012 , who ana- lysed  ‘society’  as  autopoietic  or  self-creat- ing, by means of communication  following  Maturana  and Varela ; Yuri  Lotman   1990 ,  who construed the semiosphere as a dynamic  meaning-system   or  system-of-systems   of  planetary  extent;  Brian  Arthur   2009 ,  who  analysed technology in terms of ‘combinato- rial evolution’. Stuart Kauffman  2016 , the- orist of biological and machine systems, has  recently extended his scope to ‘humanity in a  creative  universe’,  moving  beyond  the  Enlightenment tradition of reductive science  to a ‘new mythic structure’ for understanding  the  biosphere  and  noösphere.  Such  work   there  are  many  more  examples   indicates  that the study of social media is not an abrupt    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  17  discovery  of  something  new,  but  that  they  result  from  evolving  complex  systems,  and  interlock  with  others.  The  principle  of  bio- genesis  suggests  the  continuity  of  life,  by  which  life  cannot  be  understood  except  by  the existence of prior life  Vernadsky, 1998:  54–55   Figure 1.1 . Similarly, social media  are  both  self-creating  and  of  evolutionary  provenance,  and  must  be  explained  accordingly.  Further, systems interact with other, incom- mensurate,  systems.  Lotman’s  approach  to  culture  suggests  that  meaning  is  generated  across  the  boundaries  between  two  or  more  pre-existing semiotic systems  Lotman, 1990   in  a  web  of  interacting  cultural  systems  of  planetary  extent.  Similarly,  social  media  interact with other systems, cultural and tech- nological. Relations between systems are as  important as relations within them.  These  processes  are  indifferent  to  indi- viduals  –  specimens  or  species  –  so  you  can’t  really  do  evolutionary  analysis  with- out a ‘macro’ model of both planetary space  and geological time in which to situate your  ‘micro’  processes  and  specimens,  as  well  as  the  ‘meso’  institutions  or  populations  in  which they cluster  cf. Dopfer et al., 2004 .  But  for  most  of  human  history,  the  full  macro-system was simply not known. Once  they  migrated  ‘out  of  Africa’   say,  70,000  years ago , humans finally girdled the Earth  when  Polynesians  settled  the  Earth’s  last  large  uninhabited  landmass,  Aotearoa  New  Zealand  a mere 1000–1500 years ago , but  they  took  with  them  no  shared  understand- ing  of  the  planet  as  such.  They  developed  a  planetary  patchwork  of  mutually  suspi- cious  cultures  whose  competitive  interac- tions  were  marked  by  adversarial  conflict  and occasional catastrophe. Despite humans  being planetary, culture and knowledge long  remained parochial.  ‘realised’   Planetary   extent  was   in  knowledge  only  in  modernity,  following  early-modern European exploration and con- sequent imperial exploitation from the 1500s  to  the  1900s.  Knowledge  of  the  planet  as  a   single system was thus only attained as part  of Western  expansionism  once  observations  ‘here’   e.g.,  meteorology,  geology,  fauna,  flora, fossils, natural processes  could be cor- related  with  similarly  conceptualised  obser- vations  of  phenomena  found  ‘there’.  At  an  accelerating rate, the Earth became a coher- ent unit of exploration, discovery and thence  knowledge.  Finally,  Darwin  was  able  to  conceptualise the ‘social instinct’ as a plan- etary phenomenon, with ‘sympathies extend- ing’ to ‘all nations and races’, such that ‘our  thoughts’  would  come  under  the  control  of  that  knowledge,  to  value  the  macro   group   over  the  micro   individual   for  the  sake  of  survival though different but shared culture.  ‘World-hisTorical facTs’  Geology emerged as a global science in the  eighteenth  century,  in  the  pursuit  of  rocks  that  might  yield  wealth   coal,  oil,  metals,  etc. .  During  the  nineteenth  century,  such  global  ‘findings’  began  to  be  consolidated  into  disciplinary  knowledge  systems   Wallerstein, 2004  by globetrotting scholars.  Alexander  von  Humboldt’s  explorations  in  South  America  led  to  his  ‘invention’  of  ‘nature’  Wulf, 2015  and, in Cosmos  1858 ,  to  a  very  early  conceptualisation  of  the  ‘causal  interconnectivity  of  the  universe’   Walls,  2009 .  Darwin  and  Alfred  Russel  Wallace  elaborated  evolutionary  science  using insights they’d gathered from voyages  to the Galapagos Islands, South America and  the  Malay  Archipelago;  and,  in  Darwin’s  case,  return  visits  to  his  home  in  Kent  by  barnacles,  live  and  fossilised,  from  all  over  the world  Stott, 2004 .  Karl  Marx  was  an  early  ‘collector’  and  synthesiser  of  global  knowledge,  reading  ravenously through the burgeoning ‘imperial  archive’  Richards, 1993  under the dome of  the  British  Museum  Reading  Room,  navel  of world knowledge, to develop his notion of  ‘world-historical’ capitalism:   18  The  more  the  original  isolation  of  the  separate  nationalities  is  destroyed  by  the  developed  mode  of production and intercourse and the division of  labour between various nations naturally brought  forth  by  these,  the  more  history  becomes  world  history. Thus, for instance, if in England a machine  is  invented,  which  deprives  countless  workers  of  bread in India and China, and overturns the whole  form of existence of these empires, this invention  becomes  a  world-historical  fact.   Marx,  1845:  Chapter 1.B   the   Despite  this  discovery  of  world-historical  ‘facts’  in  the  socioeconomic  and  historical  domain  by  1845,  implications  of  global scale have taken much longer to work  through into widespread consciousness, espe- cially in the arena of public thought and dis- course.  Darwin’s   1871:  101   vision  of  the  diffusion of species-sociality has not yet been  realised.  Marx  was  surely  among  the  ‘few  people’ who ‘honoured and practised’ global  consciousness back in the 1840s, but strenu- ous efforts were made from that day to this to  stop what Darwin saw as a natural process of  knowledge diffusion, ‘through instruction and  example to the young, and eventually through  public  opinion’.  Aggressive  parochialism,  which  is  Mark  Pagel’s   2012   evolutionary  definition of culture, expressed as ideological  conflict  internal  and warfare  external , still  rules  the  roost.  Meanwhile,  the  very  idea  of  comprehensive,  integrated  knowledge   ‘sci- entific progress’  is widely resisted, not least  because  it  was  established  on  the  wings  of  nation-state imperialism, colonialism, milita- rism  and  class gender race  antagonism,  but  also  because  it  challenges  the  knowledge  systems that maintained ‘parochial’ cultures,  including  religion  and  ‘we’-group  self- aggrandisement,  thus  resisting  global  con- sciousness  in  relation  to  society.  In  short,  ‘world-historical’ facts have been resisted by  both ‘sides’ of the political spectrum.  Global  consciousness  was  adopted  first  in  the  natural  sciences  connected  with  the  geosphere;  and  thence  in  those  that  served  large-scale  organised  economic  activities  such  as  mining,  manufacturing  and  trade.  The  next  wave  of  knowledge-globalisation   took in the biosciences, which were synthe- sised into an evolutionary framework in the  1940s  Huxley, 1942 . Here too the integra- tion of knowledge is followed by large-scale  economic  exploitation.  In  the  most  recent  wave,  the  post-1940s  globalisation  of  tel- ecommunications,  broadcasting  and  user- centred social media took human meanings,  relationships  and  identity  around  the  world.  Again, economic exploitation followed, such  that  the  largest  global  corporations  are  cur- rently  the  ones  that  ‘mine’  the  resources  of  personal identity, relationships and meanings  most  efficiently.  Individual  subjectivity  and  global scale have at last integrated, if only in  the  culturally  impoverished  form  of  corpo- rately owned ‘big data’ and in what we now  call ‘social media’.  However, even though that process may be  accelerating,  it  too  is  resisted.  The  struggle  between   closed   system-control  and   open   user-democracy has continued. Conceptually,  it is proving as hard to separate culture from  capitalism  as  it  was  to  distinguish  science  from  imperialism,  because  the  international  trade  in  cultural  products  and  media  plat- forms  is  market-based,  putting  pressure  on  national jurisdictions to ‘open’ their citizens  as well as their economies to the global mar- ket. But market forces don’t have everything  their  own  way.  Emergent  countries  such  as  China  and  India  and  non-Western  cultural  systems such as Islam resist open media mar- kets for strategic as well as ideological rea- sons, seeing such ‘soft power’ systems as a  means to improve their own competitiveness.  The galloping corporatisation of the internet,  against  which  Jonathan  Zittrain  warned  us  way back  2008 , and its more recent appro- priation by surveillance-state agencies, is still  resisted by myriad activists, associations and  local cultures, both traditional  first peoples;  civic  organisations   and  alternative   green  activism; subcultures, WikiLeaks . Ordinary  users, consumers and citizens are also resist- ant  to  such  developments  when  they  are  experienced as over-intrusive because of sur- veillance, invasions of privacy and corporate    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  19  appropriation  of  the  ‘social  instinct’   and  its  expression   through  intellectual  property  regimes, proprietorial platforms and market- ing; or where they are corroded from within,  as  it  were,  by  personal  hate-speech,  abuse,  trolling,  flaming,  cyberbullying,  online  har- assment,  racism,  sexism  and  intolerance  of  others, all of which Emma Jane  2015  sums  up in the interdisciplinary term ‘e-bile’.  Where  the  semiosphere   including  social  media   differs  from  the  biosphere  and  geo- sphere  is  that  here  is  the  domain  of  con- sciousness,  subjectivity  and  sociality  itself,  where  all  ‘agents’   users   are  active  and  productive  makers  of  the  very  sphere  that  produces  them.  They   ‘consumers’   cannot  be ‘mined’ and ‘exploited’ in the same way  that other ‘resources’ from the geo-biosphere  have been; and we  ‘citizens’  cannot – yet –  be trusted to form a single, global, e-bile-free  ‘we’-group  who  agree  with  Darwin   1871   that  ‘the  highest  stage  in  moral  culture  at  which  we  can  arrive,  is  when  we  recognise  that we ought to control our thoughts’.  Despite the global extent of computers, tel- ecommunications, media and the internet, the  cultural ‘sphere’ remains riven by what Alice  Marwick   2013:  362   calls  ‘the  structural  oppression of difference’, even as knowledge  of the planetary extent of culture is increas- ingly widespread. It is still hard even to rep- resent the semiosphere as a single unit, since  its  variable  components  use  different  lan- guages,  technologies  and  software,  and  dif- ferent  politics  to  produce  what  look  at  first  sight  like  different  realities,  where  ‘differ- ence’ is construed as adversarial and antago- nistic. To the extent that knowledge of culture  at planetary scale and evolutionary time may  produce  understanding  that  supersedes  this  parochial aggressiveness, it can nevertheless  be  observed  that  the  expanding  knowledge  systems of modernity, which should periodi- cally be self-corrected by bouts of reflexivity,  activism,  decolonisation  and  revision,  can  extend  planetary-scale  knowledge  from  the  geosphere   resources   and  biosphere   life   into the semiosphere  cultural and mediated   meaning , to the sphere of knowledge itself –  the noösphere – as globalisation accelerates  further, across the economy, technology and  media-culture.  economy vs culTure: ‘mosT  imporTanT’ or ‘WorsT misTake’?  Pushing back to observe continuities as well  as breaks in human history and material evo- lution  can  provide  important  insights  for  contemporary  understanding.  Social  media  are  no  exception.  One  way  to  try  to  under- stand  them  is  to  look  for  continuities  with  earlier  periods,  which  may  provide  clues  about where to look for causation. For a long  time, since Marx in fact, social life has been  supposed to be ‘powered’  in every sense of  the word  by the economy. We’re not used to  thinking  about  communication,  culture  and  meaning  as  the  drivers  of  change  in  human  society.  But  recent  discoveries,  going  back  12,000 years, suggest that they are primary,  causing other kinds of social change, includ- ing economics and politics.  Most Important…  These  discoveries  are  changing  our  percep- tion of what has been claimed by many as the  ‘most  important’  of  all  ‘world-historical  facts’:  the  so-called  Neolithic  Revolution,  which  saw  the  invention  of  farming   the  economy   and  adoption  of  settlement   poli- tics .  The  idea  of  the  Neolithic  Revolution  has  become  axiomatic,  but  it  carries  with  it  assumptions that may be mistaken; and cor- recting them may change our understanding  of  what  we’re  looking  at  when  we  look  at  social media  i.e., a paradigm shift . It may  be  that  we’ve  been  confusing  causes  and  effects.  Here  is  how  the  story  of  the  Neolithic  Revolution is told, in this case sampled from  the  Khan  Academy,  where  Senta  German    20  celebrates  ‘the  cultural  advances  brought  about  by  the  Neolithic  revolution’,  which  she calls ‘the most important development in  human history’. She explains:  The way we live today, settled in homes, close to  other  people  in  towns  and  cities,  protected  by  laws, eating food grown on farms, and with leisure  time to learn, explore and invent is all a result of  the  Neolithic  revolution.  …  Before  the  Neolithic  revolution, it’s likely you would have lived with your  extended  family  as  a  nomad,  never  staying  any- where for more than a few months, always living  in  temporary  shelters,  always  searching  for  food  and  never  owning  anything  you  couldn’t  easily  pack  in  a  pocket  or  a  sack.  The  change  to  the  Neolithic way of life was huge and led to many of  the pleasures  lots of food, friends and a comfort- able home  that we still enjoy today.  German, n.d.   Great  story!   unless  you’re  an  Indigenous  person living a traditional or nomadic life; or  a  migrant  or  refugee ,  speaking  powerfully  for the continuity of history from that day to  this. But where did the idea of the Neolithic  Revolution  itself  come  from?  Why  is  it  thought so important? Did it actually occur?  The  term  was  coined  by Australian  archae- ologist  and  socialist  Vere  Gordon  Childe   1925 1958; 1936 1965 .5 Childe was a pro- gressive  cultural  evolutionist,  especially  in  relation to the mutually determining forces of  technology  and  food  production.  He  pro- posed the continuity of technological evolu- tion, through the evidence of:  … insignificant bits of flint and stone, bronze and  baked  clay  [in  which]  are  revealed  the  precondi- tions  of  our  gigantic  engines  and  of  the  whole  mechanical apparatus that constitutes the material  basis of modern life.  1925 1958: xv   According  to  Marxist  theory,  the  ‘material  basis  of  modern  life’  was  the  economy  or  ‘mode  of  production’.  Childe’s  ‘Neolithic  Revolution’  named  the  shift  from  a  hunter- gatherer economy to agriculture, when ‘man- kind’  humanity  became:  … master of his own food supply through the pos- session  of  domestic  animals  and  cultivated  plants,  and shaking off the shackles of environment by his   skill in fashioning tools for tree-felling and carpentry,  by organization for co-operative labour, and by the  beginnings of commerce.  Childe, 1925 1958: 1   Childe pushed the lines of continuity back in  time to show that the Stone Age was part of  the story of how we came to be modern  ‘our  gigantic  engines’ . The  mode  of  production   domesticating  animals  and  cultivating  plants ,  technology   tools ,  along  with  the  social organisation of cooperation and trade   political  economy ,  were  all  well  estab- lished  before  copper  and  bronze  were  first  smelted – about 5000 years ago.  Childe’s great work performed a Huxleyan  ‘modern synthesis’ for archaeology. He cre- ated a coherent story of developmental cau- sation   a.k.a.  modernist  progress   out  of  a  previous  patchwork  of  mutually  discon- nected  digs  and  findings,  many  of  which  sought  biblical  or  racist  explanations  of  the  past. Childe was careful and erudite, integrat- ing and synthesising previous knowledge. He  developed  an  inferential  method  for  associ- ating  archaeological  finds  with  the  material  conditions of ‘prehistoric cultures’  his term   that  convinced  many  professionals,  and  he  was a good science communicator at a time  when  poplar  learning  was  being  stimulated  and extended to ‘the masses’ via cheap paper- backs.  The  ‘Neolithic  Revolution’  became  ‘common  knowledge’,  faithfully  taught  in  academies ever since.  In  line  with  his  commitment  to  modern- ist  progress,  Childe  didn’t  much  like  the  Stone  Age,  at  least  prior  to  the  Neolithic  Revolution,  seeing  Mesolithic  hunter-gath- erer societies, dependent on the environment  and  with  low  levels  of  technological  and  social  organisation,  as  closer  to  animality   i.e.,  ‘primitive’   than  to  ‘civilisation’.  For  him,  the  Neolithic  Revolution  introduced  growth, enabling the gigantic engine of his- tory to sputter into accelerating motion. But  Childe’s dream of ‘shaking off the shackles  of  environment’  proved  to  be  a  modernist  delusion. His desire to find a complete break  between the Stone Age and civilisation was    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  21  also mistaken. We are just as dependent on the  environment as ever – including the geology,  climate and biota that we are busy manipu- lating.  In  fact,  Childe’s  characterisation  of  the invention of agriculture as a ‘Revolution’  owed more to the Marxist theory of his own  times than to Mesolithic realities. He wanted  the  term  to  carry  its  full  Marxist  weight,  where ‘revolution’ describes the rapid transi- tion from one economic epoch to another. It  had to be rapid, transformative and general,  precipitating new class antagonisms  in this  case between surplus-producing farmers and  surplus-consuming  specialists  such  as  elite  warriors and priests . But was it?  Agriculture’s  diffusion  from  the  ‘Fertile  Crescent’ across Eurasia and Africa was une- ven. It was invented more than once, across  different continents and islands, using differ- ent crops: wheat  Eurasia , rice  East Asia ,  maize and potato  America , millet  Africa ,  etc., or the much less nutritious taro  Papua  New Guinea .6 Some cultures developed herd- ing but not crop cultivation  Saami , while in  other places, like Aboriginal Australia, Inuit  Canada  or  Kalahari  Africa,  agriculture  was  invented  not  at  all.  But  Aboriginal  people  who live traditionally, not to mention young  people everywhere, do not reject as primitive  or  superseded  the  idea  of  living  ‘with  your  extended  family  as  a  nomad,  never  stay- ing  anywhere  for  more  than  a  few  months,  always  living  in  temporary  shelters,  always  searching  for  food  and  never  owning  any- thing you couldn’t easily pack in a pocket or  a sack’, as the Khan Academy textbook has it.  This is not a primitive dystopia but a descrip- tion of aspects of the oldest continuing cul- tures in the world, which value community,  ‘country’, ‘dreamtime’ and ceremony above  a  suburban  semi-detached.  It  also  describes  one of the world’s newest ‘cultures’ – that of  millions of displaced migrant-refugees in the  Middle  East,  Europe, Africa  and  elsewhere,  for whom ‘nomadic’ life is the new normal,  and  of  course  it  also  describes  the  mode  of  life  of  many  modern  young  adults  and  stu- dents who may find transition to settled life   more uncertain than did previous generations,  even as their intellectual and social horizons  expand via social media. Thus the presump- tion that farming and modern life are different  in kind from ‘hunter-gathering’  now known  as  ‘work-shopping’ ,  and  that  nomadic  life  is somehow indicative of primitive cultures,  can only be understood as ideological: it’s a  preferred narrative about the primacy of eco- nomics  mode of production , not a descrip- tion of how human societies work.  Worst Mistake…  The  progressivism  inherent  in  the  idea  that  today’s ‘pleasures  lots of food, friends and a  comfortable  home ’  are  confined  to  post- farming  cultures  has  been  thoroughly  cri- tiqued.  Jared  Diamond   borrowing  ideas  from  anthropologists  like  Marshall  Sahlins  and Eric Wolf  is a well-known critic:  Now  archaeology  is  demolishing  another  sacred  belief:  that  human  history  over  the  past  million  years has been a long tale of progress. In particu- lar, recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of  agriculture,  supposedly  our  most  decisive  step  toward a better life, was in many ways a catastro- phe  from  which  we  have  never  recovered.  With  agriculture  came  the  gross  social  and  sexual  ine- quality, the disease and despotism, that curse our  existence.  Diamond, 1987 7  Note  that  Diamond  isn’t  disagreeing  with  Childe’s  thesis  about  the  importance  of  the  Neolithic Revolution. It’s just that he values  its outcomes negatively instead of positively.  Like  Childe  before  him,  he  accepts  the  Marxist  narrative  of  increased  class  antago- nism. Thus, his intervention  including sub- sequent criticisms of his work  does not alter  the idea of a ‘Revolution’ but strengthens it.  Alternative  narratives  are  not  sought.  Even  counter-evidence  doesn’t  upset  the  model,  which has reified into myth. So, for example,  Samuel  Bowles   2011   found  that  the  first  farming was not more productive than forag- ing,  but  he  still  calls  the  period  in  which  farming  was  adopted  ‘Holocene   the    22  technological  revolution’  and  repeats  the  idea that this was ‘arguably the greatest ever  revolution  in  human  livelihoods’.  His  own  results, however, suggest piecemeal not revo- lutionary adoption and ascribe ‘causes’ that  come from culture  childrearing  and politics   military procurement , not economics  pro- ductivity . He concludes:  Social and demographic aspects of farming, rather  than its productivity, may have been essential to its  emergence  and  spread.  Prominent  among  these  aspects may have been the contribution of farming  to  population  growth  and  to  military  prowess,  both promoting the spread of farming as a liveli- hood.  Bowles, 2011   Gordon Childe himself did not stop at farm- ing. He was interested in ‘civilisation’, which  included  settlement.  He  coined  the  term  ‘Urban Revolution’ to mark the change from  dispersed  settlement  patterns  to  trading  towns. Among these, he was most impressed  by the Achaean  Homeric  ‘city state’, where  ‘an  international  commercial  system  linked  up  a  turbulent  multitude  of  tiny  political  units’   1958:  172 .  The  ‘Urban  Revolution’   his  term   introduced  the  development  of  international  markets,  which  managed  to  combine political competitiveness with eco- nomic cooperation through trade. Here, then,  is the full progressivist picture, a ‘grand nar- rative’  Lyotard, 1979 , which completes its  modernist look with a sustaining clamour of  contested  critique:  the  economy  led  to  growth,  class  division  and  changes  in  the  organisation  of  ‘political  units’,  accompa- nied by the development of mutually antago- nistic  classes   internally   and  competitive  states   externally ,  which  nevertheless  con- tinued to trade in ideas as well as goods.  Which came firsT – base or  supersTrucTure?  that story. My answer is no, but not because  it’s  a  story.  The  reason  for  scepticism  goes  beyond postmodern suspicion of the totalitar- ian  tendencies  in  ‘grand  narrative’   Lucy,  2016 . The problem is not only with the poli- tics  of  progress,  but  also  with  the  arrow  of  causation.  If  you  are  a  student  of  social  media, you’re going to need a theory of cul- tural  causation.  But  Childe’s  model  places  culture – ‘civilisation’ – at the end of a causal  chain  that  separates  it  from  most  of  human  history  the tens of thousands of years before  the  Neolithic  Revolution  and  among  those  cultures  that  didn’t  have  one   and  it  places  causal  priority  on  labour   mode  of  produc- tion   over  both  knowledge  and  sociality,  including mediation. But what if the arrow of  causation points the other way? What if the  ‘Neolithic Revolution’ was in fact caused by  social media; and mode of production was a  side effect, or means to an end?  In  both  of  his  revolutions  –  economic   mode of production  and political  ordered  settlement  – Childe explains causal sequence  in human history  and Diamond follows him   by  using  Marx’s  ‘base  and  superstructure’  model.  In  a  justly  famous  passage  Marx  wrote:  In the social production of their existence, humans  enter into definite, necessary relations, which are  independent of their will, namely, relations of pro- duction  corresponding  to  a  determinate  stage  of  development  of  their  material  forces  of  produc- tion.  …  The  mode  of  production  of  material  life  conditions the social, political and intellectual life- process  in  general.  It  is  not  the  consciousness  of  humanity that determines their being, but on the  contrary  it  is  their  social  being  that  determines  their consciousness.  1857 1976: 4–5   Marx  was  not  interested  in  ‘structure’  or  ‘consciousness’ as such; he was more inter- ested in the causes and dynamics of historical  change.  He  wanted  a  scientific  explanation  for  social  change  and  he  thought  the  ‘base  and superstructure’ model supplied it:  The question that any student of social media  needs to ask is whether it is safe to rely on   At a certain stage of their development, the mate- rial productive forces of society come into conflict  with the existing relations of production [property    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  23  relations].  …  From  forms  of  development  of  the  productive  forces  these  relations  turn  into  their  fetters.  At  that  point  an  era  of  social  revolution  begins. With the change in the economic founda- tion  the  whole  immense  superstructure  is  more  slowly  or  more  rapidly  transformed.   1857 1976:  4–5   That’s a terrific piece of synthesising analy- sis: its ambition, reach and rhetoric still com- mand  admiration  after  all  these  years.  Like  his previous comments on ‘world-historical’  facts, it is also an amazingly early attempt to  put  history  on  the  footing  of  a  ‘natural  sci- ence’,  complete  with  laws  arising  from  observations, and to consider it at planetary  scale. But is it true? Does the conflict between  forces and relations of production drive his- torical  change,  transforming  in  turn  the  ‘whole  immense  superstructure’  of  culture,  communication  and  consciousness?  As  it  transpires, perhaps not.  The cultural revolution?  Göbekli  Tepe  changes  everything.   Ian  Hodder,  director of archaeology, Stanford University 8  Social  groups   demes   certainly  were  trans- formed  in  the  Neolithic  period,  but  the  cru- cial question for present purposes is about the  chain  of  causation.  Did  farming  produce  surpluses, classes, growth, settlement, states,  and thus set humanity on the uneven road to  modernity? And even if it did  albeit not as a  ‘revolution’ , what ‘caused’ the invention of  farming and then of cities? Did culture  com- munication   precipitate  the  need  for  large- scale  resource-gathering  and  ordered  settlement?  And  was  it  ceremonial  activity,  perhaps  marking  the  demic  boundaries  of  large,  highly  organised  groups  and  ‘broad- casting’  their  strengths,  that  necessitated  more  intensive  modes  of  food  gathering,  herding and residential settlement? Such pos- sibilities were out of the question for Childe. The reason why such questions can be asked  at all is that we now know that monumental   building  preceded  the  agricultural  ‘revolu- tion’.  The  first  great  stone  buildings  in  the  world were put up not by surplus-generating  farmers, but thousands of years earlier – fur- ther back in time before Stonehenge  Parker  Pearson,  2012   and  Saqqara’s  pyramids   Romer,  2012   than  these  sites  are  remote  from today. The first stone monuments were  erected  by  Mesolithic  hunter-gatherers  before  pottery  was  invented,  before  metals  and before farming. The arrow of causation  may  have  to  be  reversed:  the  causal  force  for this epoch-making change was not ‘sur- plus labour’ but the concentration of groups  and intensification of communication. It was  this in turn that precipitated large-scale food  requirements  and  the  need  to  house  large  bodies of people in one place.  How  do  we  know?  Recent  discoveries,  especially at Göbekli Tepe  ‘Potbelly Hill’  in  Turkey, excavated by the late Klaus Schmidt,9  suggest that the Childean chain of causation  is  the  wrong  way  round   Hartley  and  Potts,  2014:  59–67 .  The  limestone  monuments  here are about 12,000 years old  Stonehenge  and  the  Great  Pyramid  are  not  even  5000 .  Its monumental scale – both the size of indi- vidual  20-foot-high  carved  stones  and  the  number of circles created – is astonishing, as  is  the  precision  and  beauty  of  construction.  Göbekli Tepe seems to be have been designed  as  an  expression  of  ‘symbolic  culture’   as  Schmidt  called  it   and  communal  activities  that were organised around gathering people,  resources,  knowledge  and  performance  into  one place, for one purpose: communication,  both internal, to confirm the ‘we’-group with  feasting and shared ritual, not to mention the  collaborative work and organisation of mak- ing the monument, and external ‘costly sig- nalling’, especially broadcasting this deme’s  prowess  to  foes  or  competing  neighbours  who  may  have  been  building  something  of  their own.  Altogether,  this  was  a  boundary-making  exercise,  possibly  one  designed  to  include  the  dead   burial  levels  are  not  yet  exca- vated . Indeed, it may have been a prehistoric    24  technology  for  linking  the  living  with  the  dead,  making  demic  ‘honorary  relatives’   Pagel,  2012   out  of  ancestors,  by  drawing  a new, capacious boundary around the ‘we’- group to include within the community both  time  beyond death  and place, ‘sanctifying’   as  we  might  now  say 10  the  country  where  they inhabited. Once boundaries were drawn  around such a community, it proved practical  to  do  the  same  to  the  land  required  to  sup- port it. The crowd was so big that they had  to  invent  farming  and  settlement  to  cope  with  the  pressures  created  by  congregating,  building  stone  monuments,  feasting  and  rit- ual  activities.  The  economy  and  settlement  were  merely  a  means  to  an  end.  Mesolithic  nomads,  without  metals  or  even  pottery,  began  the  process  of  ‘abstracting’  symbolic  culture into new media – in this case, lime- stone – so that everyone could find their thrill  on Potbelly Hill.  Nevertheless,  there  were  unintended  con- sequences. Once farming had been invented  and put on an efficient footing, the resources  were  so  much  the  greater  for  continuing  with  cultural  and  political  activities.  Nick  Card, director of the Ness of Brodgar dig in  Scotland,  another  recently  unearthed  won- der  that  is  older  than  Stonehenge   and  may  explain its prehistory , told PBS in 2015 that  the artefacts unearthed over the years of the  dig  had  led  him  to  change  his  view  of  its  function, from ‘something to do with life and  death’ to the suggestion that ‘people traveled  long  distances  to  the  imposing  complex  to  perform rituals, but also to feast, trade goods,  gossip  and  celebrate’.11  Perhaps  there’s  no  need to choose between these options. After  all, even the most revered ancient Greek tem- ples like the Parthenon were also treasuries –  Bronze Age  Reserve  Banks  –  storing  ‘cash  reserves  for  the  construction  of  buildings  and  the  erection  of  statues,  as  well  as  for  a  series of wars’.12 We need to understand that  trade,  gossip,  celebration   including  celeb- rities ,  treasures,  life  and  death  are  all  of  a  piece: they are culture, not ‘mode of produc- tion’. Oddly, we presume that such functions   among  the  ancients  were  religious;  but  we  assume  the  same  functions  now  –  in  social  media for instance – are profane.  Best Story  Belittling the present in the name of the past  is one thing; it is accompanied by an equally  bad habit of belittling the past in the name of  the present. Modern science habitually makes  a distinction between story  culture  as unre- liable and imagined  ‘old wives’ tales’ , as if  those attributes were not also present in sci- ence   as  per  the  theory  of  the  Neolithic  Revolution ;  and  science   knowledge   as  reliable  and  evidential,  as  if  these  attributes  are not present in stories. These are print-era  prejudices  Ong, 2012 , based on the differ- ence between oral-aural mediation of knowl- edge   language,  drama,  song,  spectacle,  ceremony, audio-visual media  and the more  easily  abstracted  written printed  mediation  of knowledge, out of which modern science  emerged  in  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  centuries.  One  way  of  countering  such  prejudice  is   as  above   to  draw  attention  to  storytelling  in science. Another is to apply the scientific  method  to  storytelling  itself,  linking  biosci- ence to linguistics, for example, as have Sara  da  Silva  and  Jamie  Tehrani   2016 .  Their  ‘phylogenetic’  method  of  analysis,  showing  how stories found across different languages  may indicate a ‘common ancestor’ language,  and thus a date for the origin of particular sto- ries  not just storytelling in general , has pro- duced  remarkable  results.  The  oldest  story  they  identify  is  ‘The  Smith  and  the  Devil’,  about a man who learns the secret of smelt- ing metal with fire by doing a deal with the  devil  and then outwits him to keep both the  secret and his soul . Variations on this ‘fairy  tale’ are still forceful in the modern Western  imagination. The modern Faustian version13  moralises about the dangers of untrammelled  knowledge, but equally it tells of the power of  knowledge   fire,  metallurgy,  transformation    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  25  of materials , the impact of such knowledge  on  individuals  and  society,  and  the  social  ambivalence  of  the  specialist  crafts  where  such knowledge is mastered.  Silva  and  Tehrani   2016   report  that  ‘the  Smith  and  the  Devil’  is  at  least  6000  years  old.  It  appears  in  the  language  repertoire  at  about  the  same  time  as  smelting   first  lead  and  tin,  then  copper  and  the  hard sharp  alloy  bronze ,  in  the  right  place  – Anatolia   ‘Asia  Minor’   –  at  the  right  time,  when  the  ‘proto-Indo-European’   PIE   language  split from Hittite. The story imputes the ori- gin  of  knowledge  to  a  supernatural  agent,  but  that  only  reflects  the  state  of  scientific  understanding at the time  humans were and  remain unsure about where ‘life’ stops . The  attempt to ascribe causal sequence was pre- sent,  as  was  the  threat  of  disruptive  knowl- edge to existing society: after all, metallurgy  was responsible for the ‘creative destruction’  of an entire epoch  the ‘Stone’ Age . Where  the story still outpaces science is its imagina- tive and emotional charge in making clear the  disruptive  danger  of  innovation,  the  human  risks of knowing more than your deme, even  though specialisation of knowledge is neces- sary  within  a  group. The  story  of  the  smith  and  the  devil,  or  of  other  disruptive  agents,  like  Dr  Faustus  or  Don  Juan,  shows  how  a  deme  seeks  simultaneously  to  hold  itself  together  by  sharing  the  tale  and  its  world- view, even as the energies of innovation tear  it  apart,  leaving  the  figure  of  the  Trickster- artist-entrepreneur  Hartley, 2012: 199–214   to exploit and benefit from the gap between  present rules and future possibilities, at mor- tal risk to themselves.  children musT be scene buT   noT earn?  The sanctioned time for stories is childhood.  But  empirical  social  science  barely  notices  children  when  modelling  social  structures  and  agency.  They  only  enter  the  picture  as   behavioural problems – vulnerable victims or  disruptive  youth.  Cultural  science,  on  the  other  hand,  accords  a  central  conceptual  place  to  children.  The  activities  associated  with growing up, playing, socialising, copy- ing,  making  mischief,  daydreaming,  going  around in gangs or cliques while creating new  slang,  crazes,  celebrities,  and  associations,  give to them as a group the cultural function  of forming new future-facing demes, thereby  maintaining  dynamism  in  cultural  systems   Hartley  and  Potts,  2014:  Chapter  8 .  Thus,  an  evolutionary  perspective  on  social  media  would ask how young people form groups.  When children start to make groups among  non-kin  they  are  experimenting  with  deme- formation, and also developing real links for  future social networks. Thus, children create  the next set of demes or culture-made groups,  bound together by lived sociality and mutual  knowledge that can only be acquired by liv- ing in the process and learning the language.  Their groups are divided from others  foreign  and  parental  versions   by  asymmetries  of  trust, comprehension and cooperation, codes  for which are learned in childish play, includ- ing  playing  with  online  social  media.  Here,  ‘play’ is mistaken in social science as ‘incon- sequential’  and  ‘unproductive’  behaviour,  using  economic  measures  to  determine  cul- ture, and thus posing a ‘biological puzzle’ for  those  who  seek  a  ‘rational  choice’  account  of  it   Konner,  2010:  500 .  Play   including  its  modern,  mediated  forms,  from  gaming  and sport to entertainment, music and dance   needs to be reconceptualised, using cultural  functions  to  explain  a  dynamic  process  of  group-formation  and  thence  transmission  of  knowledge,  know-how  and  technolo- gies  through  time   Hartley  and  Potts,  2014:   175–183 ,  where,  again,  economic  produc- tivity is a consequence, not a cause.  Despite  their  centrality  to  the  reproduc- tion  of  a  culture,  children  and  young  peo- ple  are  generally  represented  in  media  and  scholarship  in  rather  different  guise,  that  of  ‘innocence’. Instead of being seen as future- forming  agents,  they  are  looked  at  with    26  anxiety and rarely permitted, even in semio- sis, a creative, productive role. Childish inno- cence is the preferred image of euphoria for  capitalist  marketing.  But  when  children  are  productive,  economically  and  creatively,  from underclass child-labour in farm and fac- tory  to  ‘under-age’  models  and  actors,  they  attract  discourses  of  anxiety,  protection  and  correction.  Economic  productivity  in  chil- dren is represented as going beyond the limit  of the social  and thereby setting that demic  limit . ‘Letting children be children!’ means  confining  them  to  uselessness:  politically  unenfranchised,  economically  unproduc- tive, behaviourally inconsequential, sexually  impotent and creatively of no account, most  themselves when most idle and irresponsible.  They are very much a latter-day Veblenesque  ‘leisure  class’,  their  conspicuous  wasteful- ness an index of their society’s affluence  or,  where they are exploited as a labour force, its  poverty .  Actual living humans have to reverse these  values  as  they  traverse  from  child  to  adult,  exchanging  unknowing  unproductivity  for  economic and social responsibility. It’s a hard  trick to pull off, and they must perform it in  public,  always  being  looked  at  and  looking   Hickey-Moody,  2015:  145 ,  as  they  make  themselves  up  under  surveillance  by  both  peers and by agencies interested in enforcing  certain  choices  upon  them. As  they  experi- ment  with  the  possibilities  of  social  media,  they are building selves and society: longing  for  love,  fearing  death,  combining  identity   ‘me’   and  belonging   ‘we’   in  new  demic  groups.  Their  creative  and  communicative  dynamism demonstrates that the uncertainty,  anxiety  and  differentiation  associated  with  coming of age is one of the engines of eco- nomic productivity in the creative epoch.  Science  has  inherited  a  view  of  children  as underperforming or incomplete economic  assets, to which the only response is control,  combined with a knowledge-regime that dis- counts  whatever  they  produce.  But  such  a  tradition not only mistakes the role children  are  playing  in  social  reproduction,  it  also   misconstrues  social  media  and  associated  institutions  such  as  celebrity,  entertainment  and  games,  dismissing  them  as  inconse- quential leisure, distraction, even dangerous  delusion. But if we think of young people as  cultural agents for the growth of knowledge  and  creative  of  groups,  meanings,  sociality,  relationships and identity, then we may need  to re-set the predominant governance mecha- nisms.  If  there’s  a  point  where  systems  are  flexible  enough  to  sustain  themselves,  the  ‘control’ setting needs to be counterbalanced  with  an  ‘open’  setting,  and  children  them- selves  –  as  a  deme  –  test  where  that  point  can be set. It may even be that social media  are a ‘natural experiment’ in this very enter- prise. We need to rethink how our inherited  knowledge  systems  understand   and  dis- count   ‘primitive’  culture,  fictional  stories  and ‘childish’ behaviour. All of these might  have something to teach us.  ‘good ancesTors’  In  his  postscript  to  The  Gift,  Lewis  Hyde  makes  a  compelling  case  for  valuing  those  who build futures:  Those who have the wit and power and vision to  build beyond their own day: for artists, those will  be the good ancestors of the generations of prac- titioners that will follow when we are gone.  Hyde,  2007: 385   Who  are  the  ‘good  ancestors’  of  social  media? It’s a long way from Göbekli Tepe to  Taylor Swift, you may say. But both of them  may  be  performing  the  same  cultural  func- tion:  using  the  highest-technology  social  media of the day to call together and to rep- resent  in  symbolic  form  the  creation  and  unity of the deme, which, for all ‘we’ know,  extends to the whole of humanity. We don’t  know who was top of the bill at Potbelly Hill,  but it’s a good bet that it was an all-singing,  all-dancing venue.14 So why not a Mesolithic –  and  megalithic  –  Taylor  Swift?  I’m  not  the    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  27  only  one  to  have  noticed  this:  a  former  Presidential advisor has too, when writing in  the  Washington  Post  about  Yuval  Harari’s  Sapiens  2014 :  Then,  to  cut  a  long  story  short,  came  coinage,  empires,  monotheism,  cathedrals,  global  capital- ism,  Newton’s  Principia  Mathematica,  the  moon  landing  and  Taylor  Swift.   Washington  Post,  2015 15  As ‘arguably the most famous and influential  entertainer  on  earth’   Vanity  Fair,  August  2015 ,  Taylor  Swift  is  the  current  queen  of  social media. She has followers in the multi- ple  millions  on  Twitter,  Facebook,  Tumblr  and Instagram. Media commentary uses her  as  a  representation  of  worldwide  unity  for  young and old, quoting insiders who:  liken her deeply personal storytelling to new chap- ters of a book the whole world wants to read. …  ‘We’re all talking about it. In my lifetime, I haven’t  experienced that since Michael Jackson – that one  artist who stands above and unites us all.’  Vogue,  2015 16  Commentary about Swift often mentions her  ‘squad’ of celebrity BFFs, through which she  ‘models’  how  social  media  bring  women  together  in  friendship  –  another  kind  of  deme-formation. She is quoted as saying:  ‘When  you’ve  got  this  group  of  girls  who  need  each other as much as we need each other, in this  climate, when it’s so hard for women to be under- stood and portrayed the right way in the media …  now more than ever we need to be good and kind  to each other and not judge each other…’.  Vanity  Fair, 2015 17  Of  course,  scepticism  is  never  far  from  the  surface.  The  Murdoch  media  are  always  on  hand to put the record straight. No sooner had  Swift’s  ‘squad’  been  recognised  as  a  thing  than the New York Post announced that it ‘has  become  a  cult’,  reinforcing  her  ‘Stalin-like  control  of  the  entertainment  industry’.  The  squad’s unpaid appearance on one of Swift’s  videos  was  not  Hyde’s  gift  economy  but  ‘indentured servitude’. News Corp’s message  to  fans:  ‘Taylor  Swift  and  her  squad  were   once the goal of millennials everywhere, but  now they’re just plain creepy.’18 Or, we may  say, the ‘good ancestors’ of a new deme.  o, o, Those aWful daWks  Talking of sceptics, there’s only one way to  close  a  chapter  like  this.  It  has  to  be  about  evolutionary phenomena in social media: in  this case none other than Richard Dawkins,  well-known  evolutionary  scientist,  together  with his own ‘squad’, who I’m going to call  the ‘Dawks’. This is not very polite, because  Dawk  is  {Dawkins  +  dork  +  Orcs},19  but  I  coin  it  in  homage  to  the  American  critic  Edmund  Wilson’s  wonderfully  acerbic  review of J.R.R. Tolkein’s The Fellowship of  the  Ring   Wilson,  1956 .  Wilson  blames  Tolkein’s  readers,  especially  among  the  English, for pretentiousness and infantilism.  These barbs seem ready-sharpened for battle  with ‘those awful Dawks’ – the e-bile trolls  of  social  media  who’re  ‘gonna  hate’,  as  Taylor  Swift  puts  it  in  ‘Shake  it  Off’.  The  Dawks  ‘follow’  the  burning  eye,  not  of  Sauron,20 but of a character I’m going to call  ‘Sciron’,  denoting  an  ancient  scientist  who  once excelled in his craft but later thinks he’s  replaced  God,  and  who  in  the  end  is  only  ever seen in the form of an angry eye trying  to impose his will on naive mortals.  While I was writing this chapter, Dawkins  and the Dawks were having fun. Richard found  a piece of research that set him off. Sciron’s  Angry  Eye  flared  into  life  on  Twitter. Anna  Hickey-Moody, an Australian academic at the  University of London, had ‘developed a philo- sophically informed, cultural studies approach  to youth, disability and gender’  according to  her Goldsmiths’ profile . In the course of that  work,  her  paper  on  ‘Carbon  fibre  masculin- ity’   Hickey-Moody,  2015   was  uploaded  to  ResearchGate.net   a  ‘social  networking  site  for scientists and researchers’ . In the course  of a consideration of the links among carbon- fibre  technologies,  homosociality,  disability    28  and the case of Olympic athlete and domes- tic murderer Oscar Pistorius, Hickey-Moody  invoked  Continental  theory   specifically,  Deleuze . That is what seems to have caught  Sciron’s eye. He repeatedly tweeted contemp- tuous dismissal of the research as ‘pretentious  bullshit-peddling’   Figure  1.2 ,  invoking  the  ‘Sokal hoax’  Lucy, 2016 , to the delight of  various dutiful Dawks.  There  followed  a  predictable  outburst  of  copycat trolling, mixed with messages of sup- port  for  both  Dawkins  and  Hickey-Moody,  which soon spilt over from Twitter to Facebook  and  various  online  forums.21  Hickey-Moody  suggested  that  her  critics  should  read  more  and  respect   demic   boundaries  of  expertise  and discipline. She wrote directly to Dawkins:  ‘Your very enthusiastic followers have located  images of me and posted them to my twitter  page along with personal insults and abuse.’  She asked him to apologise. Dawkins replied  that  ‘I  greatly  deplore  any  personal  abuse’  but held off from ‘issuing an apology for my  tweets’  on  the  grounds  of  Hickey-Moody’s  suspected  ‘affinities’  with  philosophers  dis- approved  of  by  Dawkins.22  Dawkins  con- tinued  to  tweet  about  how  much  he  loathes  ‘pretension’  pretentiousness , with a meant- to-be-funny phallic flourish featuring a space  rocket  and  a  link  to  Hickey-Moody’s  paper,  unrepentantly captioned: ‘AND it’s stiff with  carbon fibre. OMG’  Figure 1.2 .  Over  on  chat  forums  like  Utopia  Talk,  some Dawks took this as a prompt to express  misogynistic  abuse   although  some  attempt  was made to understand the issue , including:  – srsly just kill yourself cow –  Facilitating the decline of academia by support-  ing this cunt  name.  –  Rofl@fat angry ugly lesbian with hyphenated last   – This is the kind of education the queen is against. –  I sure as hell don’t want to be the one to tell this  …  can  I  use  woman?  …  this  woman  that  her  research is not scientific. She’d probably come at  me with hedge clippers.  Utopia Talk   One  of  these  same  commentators  remarked,  however:  ‘you  can  tell  by  dawkins’  angry   homosocial trolls attacking her on social media  that  she  hits  the  bullseye’,  which  elicited  in  response only: ‘Bulls are the male cows’.  Over  on  The  Skeptics’  Guide  to  the  Universe, one contributor offered a reflexive  comment  that  echoed  Charles  Darwin’s  test  for  high  ‘moral  culture’  –  ‘when  we  recog- nise  that  we  ought  to  control  our  thoughts’   1871  – and indeed it seemed to temper sub- sequent discussion on this thread:  Oh  no,  a  scholar  published  a  theoretical  article  where she attempts to apply a point of view to her  research subject that you guys don’t like! The logi- cal conclusion is that she must have mental issues  and is definitely horrible at what she does. What  has this world come to, when people whose job is  to  think  are  not  constrained  by  others’  views  on  what  people  should  think  about  and  how  they  should do that.  Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe   The  furore  led  to  re-posts  of  mainstream  journalism and blogs, especially items from  The  Guardian  and  a  critique  from  blogger  Rebecca Watson  Skepchick .23 In a lengthy  profile by Sophie Elmhirst in The Guardian,  Dawkins  is  reported  as  playing  down  his  controversialism on Twitter:  In  conversation,  Dawkins  seemed  concerned  that  an  article  about  him  would  draw  disproportion- ately on his Twitter feed – in his eyes, an insignifi- cant  late  chapter  in  the  context  of  his  whole  career. ‘I’m a scientist,’ he said, as if this fact might  be forgotten.  The Guardian   That  is  a  definite  risk.  Doubtless  Dawkins  would use the science-teacher’s defence that  he  mentions  in  his  Guardian  profile:  ‘Very  often  I’m  not  making  a  point,  but  asking  a  question’   see  Figure  1.2  for  the  tenor  of  those . But his communicative intentions are  not  ‘read’  in  quite  the  same  way  in  the  Twittersphere, where users trump  producers  in  the  matter  of  deciding  what  something  means. Here, he is Sciron of the Angry Eye!  And of course Dawkins is not just a misun- derstood  scientist.  He’s  a  professional  con- troversialist,  riding  the  wave  of  celebrity  to  create  an  adversarial  social-media  ‘deme’  with  very  definite  boundaries:  inside  are    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  29  figure 1.2  dawkins, december 17–19, 2015. source: courtesy of anna hickey-moody  ‘goodness, how i loathe pretension.’ a selection of tweets, from to richard    30  scientific  rationalists,  atheists  …  and  truth;  outside  are  bilge,  rubbish,  pretension,  bullshit  …  a.k.a  postmodernism,  cultural  studies  and  identity  politics.  Dawkins  sees  only one of these groups as a ‘tribe’. His own  deme is labelled ‘individuals’:  Identity  Politics  is  surely  one  of  the  great  evils  of  our age. Stand for yourself as an individual, not a  representative of a tribe.  Twitter: Figure 1.2   between   Dawkins does not admit as ‘research’  much  less science  methods derived from ‘theory’  in the humanities, but instead acts as what in  cultural science is called the Bad Neighbour  or  Malvoisine   Hartley  and  Potts,  2014:  Chapter  4 .  He  seeks  to  ‘cooperate’  with  such disciplines Sciron-style, by destroying,  at  least  rhetorically,  those  who  are  ‘still  defending the pretentious bilge exposed by  the  great  Sokal  hoax’.  But  as  McKenzie  Wark  has  helpfully  argued,  a  useful  out- come  of  the  Sokal  affair  would  be  rap- prochement  postmodernism   language  arts   and  sciences:  ‘to  get  those  who  study  the  language  arts  to  pay  more  attention to how other modes of knowledge  actually work’; and at the same time not to  accept  attempts  to  ‘preserve  scientific  authority  in  the  public  realm  from  legiti- mate and even in a broad sense “scientific”  scrutiny’   in  Lucy,  2016:  185 .  The  Sokal  affair is ultimately about who has the author- ity  to  speak  about  truth;  and  that  is  what  Dawkins  wants.  There’s  no  room  here  for  consilience  between  evolutionary  science  and  cultural  studies.  Instead  of  that,  he enjoins Hickey-Moody to ‘Give up & do  some honest work’.  sciron – or culTural science?  Readers of this chapter will by now have gath- ered that I think this is not the right way for- ward. Citizens of social media are unlikely to  be recruited to new ideas by such foe- creating  strategies, and meanwhile evolutionary theory   suffers reputational risk if it is associated with  misogyny,  parochial  aggressiveness  and  ad  hominem  attacks.  If  we’re  trying  to  create,  with James Carey, ‘a science of creation and  construction, a science of understanding and  common action … a science of enlightenment  or  citizenship,  a  science  in  society’   2000:  22 ,  then  attempts  to  impose  control  and  to  close  down  communication  between  natural  and cultural sciences don’t advance the cause  of knowledge; it just stirs up the Dawks. The  BBC announced that 2015 was ‘The year that  angry  won  the  internet’.24  The  hosepipe  of  hate  is  not  a  sustainable  scenario  for  social  media.  But in the epoch of a global, creative econ- omy and with knowledge technologies such  as social media linking more people to more  knowledge  than  ever  before,  it  is  important  for professional researchers, scientists, theo- rists, commentators, polemicists and citizens  not to pursue aggressive parochialism, but to  recognise that difference – the more mutually  incomprehensible the better, perhaps – is the  catalyst of new ideas. ‘We’ all now live in the  same semiosphere, the same noösphere, and  have  begun  to  recognise  the  importance  of  social media, rhetoric and ‘fictions’ in organ- ising  human  thought  and  collective  action.  So, yeah, ‘we have always been social’, but  the question now is – what are we  so many  more of us than ever  going to do about it?  Science,  evolution  and  complexity  are  not  the  enemies  of  culture,  communication  and  media.  Science  and  stories  are  one  and  the  same  thing   Haraway,  1990 .  Can  we  use  both  to  tell  a  new,  inclusive,  Swiftian  truth  about  knowledge   learning  from  difference,  not  belittling  or  oppressing  it   –  as  best  we  can,  knowing  it’ll  all  be  wrong  again  soon  enough  –  without  coming  across  to  each  other as Dawks?  This chapter has operated on a theory of cul- ture and a new approach to ‘cultural science’  that is based on the causal primacy of com- municative  sociality  and  group- formation,  held  things,   language, story and other such social-media   together  by,  among  other    soCial Media as an evolutionary PhenoMenon  31  institutions,  both  technologically  equipped  and  otherwise.  In  this  account,  the  earliest  charismatic  monuments  erected  by  our  spe- cies,  from  Göbekli Tepe  to  Stonehenge  and  the  Pyramids,  are  nothing  less  than  mass  media,  within  a  network  of  social  media,  broadcasting  messages  about  community  to  whole  populations.  Culture  and  com- munication  systems  perceive  the  world  for  us  and  shape  our  demes  as  high-trust  ‘we’- groups with a common but dynamic identity,  which  are  distinguished  from  adversarial  or  low-trust ‘they’-groups by recognised differ- ences. Social media are group-forming insti- tutions of inclusion and exclusion, and demic  groups  are  powerful  both  internally   they  ‘crowdsource’  some  new  ideas  while  con- trolling  others   and  externally   they  protect  ‘our’ knowledge and culture from incursions  while plundering ‘theirs’ . Equally, they are  vulnerable to lethal force and duplicity, both  internal  and  external. They  don’t  even  exist  ‘in nature’  Harari, 2014  – they’re made not  found – so they need elaborate rituals, stories,  ceremonies and ‘sacred sites’ to sustain their  centrality for the group. Since culture-made  groups  are  the  survival  vehicles  for  knowl- edge and technology, they are, as it were, the  prime directive for humans. Among their side  effects  or  unintended  consequences  are  the  economy, politics, and the specialisation  and  thus  industrialisation   of  knowledge.  How  these domains will evolve when the dynam- ics of change are generalised throughout the  population, including children and postmod- ernists, rather than remaining in the hands of  Faustian experts and their Dawkish retainers,  remains to be seen. Perhaps later chapters of  this very book will show us.  Notes   1   Every nucleic cell – and organism – that ever lived   and  that’s  a  big  number   owes  its  life  to  mito- chondria.  Originally  independent  bacteria,  then  accidental ‘visitors’ that overstayed in cells, mito- chondria are: ‘essential to the life … and death …  of  a  cell’.  They  supply  cellular  energy  and  they   also  exercise  the  power  of  life  and  death  over  every  potential  new  human:  ‘Mitochondria  are  also  thought  to  influence,  by  exercising  a  veto,  which eggs in a woman should be released dur- ing  ovulation  and  which  should  be  destroyed  by  programmed  cell  death   apoptosis ’:  http:   bscb.org learning-resources softcell-e-learning  mitochondrion-much-more-than-an-energy-  converter    2   Quotation  source:  http:  tolweb.org tree home. pages structure.html.

American  troops had left Vietnam after almost two dec- ades  of  grueling  warfare,  and  18-year-olds  had finally been awarded the right to vote in  state  and  federal  elections.  Alex  Haley’s   1976  novel Roots: The Saga of an American  Family spent more than five months at the top  of  the  bestseller  list,  and  16,000  activists  marched in Springfield, Illinois to show their  support  for  the  Equal  Rights  Amendment.  Much had changed during the previous dec- ades  on  almost  every  front,  but  our  global  communication  landscape  remained  largely  unchanged  in  fundamental  ways.  Although  the long sixties had incubated a vibrant under- ground press, inexpensive public access tele- vision,  and  community  radio  projects,  these  experiments  were  the  exception  rather  than   the rule. For the most part, television, radio,  magazines,  and  newspapers  were  viewed  as  vehicles  for  one-to-many  mass  communica- tion rather than as platforms for conversation  and distributed creativity.  As  A.  J.  Liebling  famously  observed,  ‘freedom  of  the  press  is  guaranteed  only  to  those who own one.’ In the wake of the 1973  oil  crisis,  few  citizens  had  enough  money  to  purchase  a  press,  let  alone  a  radio  sta- tion,  a  television  station,  or  a  satellite.  Lee  Felsenstein   1993   describes  the  epiphany  he had one evening when watching the blue  cathode light emitting through his neighbor’s  windows. ‘They were all getting their infor- mation from Walter Cronkite in New York,’  says Felsenstein, but ‘we had no ready way of  getting information to each other.’ This was  about to change.  During the next two decades, the cultural  and political revolutions of the 1960s would  be  followed  by  a  technological  revolution  that  radically  decentralized  communication  power.  The  personal  computer,  the  smart  modem,  and  bulletin  board  systems  were  vanguard technologies of the digital revolu- tion.  For  computer  enthusiasts  around  the  world,  bulletin  board  systems  were  a  thrill- ing on-ramp to a global network of engaged,    36  interactive human beings. Between 1978 and  2001,  there  were  more  than  93,000  bulletin  board systems in existence  Scott, 2001 . At  the  peak  of  the  BBS  scene,  in  1994,  there  were  approximately  45,000  bulletin  board  systems  in  the  United  States  alone   Scott,  2001 . Far from a purely American phenom- enon, these systems were linked to millions  of  computer  users  around  the  world   Bush,  1993 , and they displayed many similarities  to European computer networks such as the  Minitel in France  Schofield, 2012 .  This chapter discusses the rise and fall of  the BBS scene in the closing decades of the  twentieth  century.  This  period  is  significant  because almost all of the conversations asso- ciated with contemporary social media were  originally  articulated  in  connection  with  computer  bulletin  board  systems.  Concerns  about  the  ways  teenagers  use  the  technol- ogy? Check. Prurient discussions about sex- ual  gratification  on  the  local  news?  Check.  Entrepreneurial enthusiasm for the way this  ‘game  changing’  technology  threatens  tra- ditional  business  models?  Check. Anxieties  about  falling  in  love  with  someone  without  meeting  them  face  to  face?  Check.  Utopian  excitement  about  ways  the  new  technology  can  help  dissidents  and  traditionally  disen- franchised  citizens?  Check.  In  fact,  BBSs  were  some  of  the  very  first  social  media   Driscoll,  2014 ,  and  they  arrived  on  the  scene decades before Twitter, Snapchat, and  Facebook.  At the heart of this claim is the term ‘social  media.’ The phrase is widely used but rarely  defined. When pressed for a definition, many  recite  a  list  of  contemporary  platforms,  but  defining a medium by its current technologi- cal instantiation makes little sense in a world  characterized  by  the  exponential  growth  of  information technology. As those who study  media often explain, some of yesterday’s most  popular  platforms  have  been  ignored,  and  tomorrow’s  champions  have  not  yet  arrived   Obar & Wildman, 2015 . For this reason, the  best definitions are not tethered to a specific  implementation.  Carr  and  Hayes   2015:  50    define social media as ‘Internet-based chan- nels  that  allow  users  to  opportunistically  interact and selectively self-present, either in  real-time or asynchronously, with both broad  and narrow audiences who derive value from  user-generated content and the perception of  interaction with others’. If not for the require- ment that social media channels be Internet- based,  Carr  and  Haye’s  definition  is  an  apt  description of the bulletin board systems that  flourished from 1977 through 1997.  The  following  pages  trace  the  fascinat- ing  story  of  computer  bulletin  boards,  from  their  emergence  as  a  fringe  technology  for  computer  enthusiasts  to  mainstream  accept- ance at both a national and global level. As  the BBS scene matured, the user base grew   more diverse, and these systems affected the  world  of  politics  and  culture.  Courts  strug- gled  to  understand  the  legal  implications  of  these new technologies, and law enforcement  raced to keep up with an emerging computer  underground. And then, just as the BBS scene  was poised on the brink of global success, it  was vaporized – blindsided by the privatiza- tion of the global Internet.  communiTy memory and The  firsT bulleTin board sysTems  It  all  started  in  1973  with  Community  Memory,  a  bold  attempt  to  revitalize  com- munities  by  establishing  ‘strong,  free  non- hierarchical  channels  of  communication’   Schuler,  1994 .  Community  Memory  was  created  when  a  small  collective  of  techno- logically  literate  radicals  erected  coin-  operated computer terminals in record stores,  libraries,  and  laundromats  throughout  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area   Slaton,  2001 .  Citizens were encouraged to use these termi- nals as vehicles for anonymous communica- tion about topics of interest – there were no  limits placed on potential topics. Users could  read  messages  for  free,  post  new  messages  for  one  quarter,  and  create  new  forums  for    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     37  one dollar  Schuler, 1994 . As Judith Milhon  later observed, ‘the idea was to make a new  medium so useful, yet so yummy, that people  would want to use it again and again’  Slaton,  2001 .  From  the  very  beginning,  it  was  the  users  themselves  who  shaped  the  network’s  evolution. Whether discussing People’s Park,  sharing vegetarian recipes, or reviewing con- certs  from  local  performers,  Community  Memory was composed entirely of what we  would today refer to as ‘user-generated con- tent’   Felsenstein,  1993 .  The  project  was  centered  in  the  Bay  Area,  but  Community  Memory’s  creators  believed  that  it  had  the  potential  to  shake  up  the  nation.  ‘Without  making Ma Bell any richer,’ they wrote, ‘we  could have a national news network, a means  of coordination for national political action, a  fast mail service, and a way to hold long term  dialogue  on  problems  of  greater  than  local  interest’  Szpakowski, 2006 .  Community  Memory  disbanded  before  it could fulfill this vision, but it served as a  ‘proof of concept’ and paved the way for sim- ilar experiments. In 1978, hoping to facilitate  communication  between  Chicago  residents  interested  in  the  world  of  computers,  Ward  Christensen  and  Randy  Seuss  developed  something  they  called  ‘The  Computerized  Hobbyists  Bulletin  Board  System   CBBS .’  After  connecting  to  the  system  with  his  or  her computer, an individual user could read  messages  posted  by  other  people  and  post  messages  for  others  to  read.  The  project  was a success. News of the system traveled  far  beyond  Chicago,  and  the  board  soon  began  receiving  telephone  calls  from  com- puter users across the country  Seger, 1983 .  Realizing that they had stumbled into some- thing exciting, Christensen and Seuss  1978   documented their project in the pages of Byte  Magazine, predicting a world in which mul- tiple bulletin boards could be linked to func- tion as ‘nodes in a communication network of  automated  message  and  process  switching’   1978: 151 .  At the core of this system was a piece of  technology  called  a  modem.  By  converting   information   digital  into  sound  waves,  modems made it possible for a computer in  one location to exchange information with a  computer on the opposite side of town – or  the opposite side of the world. At first, peo- ple  did  not  realize  the  revolutionary  impli- cations  of  this  breakthrough,  and  the  BBS  scene grew slowly. Modems were expensive  and  they  lacked  a  common  standard  that  could  transcend  the  balkanization  of  differ- ent  computer  platforms.  However,  in  1981,  the  Hayes  Smart  Modem  added  a  layer  of  data abstraction that facilitated communica- tion  across  platforms   Gilbertson,  2010 .  It  also included something called a ‘command  set’ – a set of special instructions that hob- byists could use to modify and extend their  modem’s  functionality.  Soon,  almost  all  modems were Hayes-compatible, fueling the  growth  of  the  bulletin  board  scene  and  the  computer  industry  that  served  it   Ceruzzi,  1998; Preimesberger, 2012 .  bulleTin board sysTems   arrive on The scene  By 1983, CBBS was receiving 50 calls a day,  and  more  than  800  microcomputer  bulletin  boards  had  sprouted  up  across  the  country   Seger,  1983 .  Behind  each  of  these  boards  was  a  system  operator   sysop   responsible  for  purchasing  and  configuring  the  BBS  computer, and for paying telephone expenses.  Why would someone do this if there was no  profit to be found in these primitive systems?  One early chronicler of the BBS scene noted,  ‘the majority of bulletin boards … are run by  rather altruistic individuals who derive great  satisfaction from computerized communica- tion’  Seger, 1983 .  BBS software continued to evolve over the  years, expanding the reach and participatory  potential  of  these  systems. These  early  bul- letin  boards  fostered  discussion  on  a  wide  range of topics, but there were fundamental    38  similarities  across  all  bulletin  boards.  First,  the  process  of  connecting  to  a  BBS  was  almost  always  the  same.  The  user  would  instruct  the  modem  to  dial  the  telephone  number  of  the  BBS.  To  avoid  toll  charges,  this was typically a local number. If the BBS  line was not busy, the modem would emit a  series of beeps  the handshake , followed by  a  squealing  static  sound  that  signaled  con- nection. At  this  point,  the  host  BBS  would  take  over  the  computer  screen,  displaying  a  configuration  of  text-based  menus.  Second,  regardless of the system’s topical focus, users  could expect to engage in the same sorts of  activities. Almost all bulletin board systems  encouraged  users  to  send  and  receive  elec- tronic messages  an early form of electronic  mail ,  to  participate  in  threaded  discussion  forums, to exchange public domain software,  to exchange text files  e.g., recipes, computer  tutorials,  political  manifestos,  and  movie  reviews , and to enjoy single-player games.1  the   Because   first  wave  of  bulletin   board  systems  could  only  sustain  one   telephone  connection  at  a  time,  this  was   asynchronous  communication  –  users  were  not communicating with one another in real  time.  Over  time,  modems  became  faster,  operating  systems  became  more  sophisti- cated,  and  graphics  capabilities  improved  dramatically.  This  paved  the  way  for  new  BBS  functionality.  Users  engaged  in  syn- chronous  chat,  they  played  games  with  one  another in real time, and they exchanged low- resolution images  Scott, 2008 .  As news of bulletin board systems spread,  reporters  struggled  to  explain  the  technol- ogy to those who were wrapping their head  around  the  concept  for  the  first  time.  They  invariably  stressed  the  range  of  topics,  the  engagement of users, and the civic potential  of these networks. Phoebe Hoban  1984  sug- gested that bulletin board systems could be  viewed as a version of the Sunday New York  Times ‘constantly being rewritten by a cross- section of New York’s population’ while fea- turing ‘discussions on literally every possible  topic’  1984: 19 . Another reporter described   bulletin boards as a ‘humbling and electrify- ing’ antidote to the passivity encouraged by  traditional  media.  ‘This  kind  of  news  isn’t  passive,’  he  wrote.  ‘It  consumes  back.  …  Imagine  a  newspaper  reading  you,  asking  you what you know, how you feel about the  stories in it’  Katz, 1993 . Other commenta- tors were quick to recognize the potential of  these systems, predicting that bulletin board  systems would someday be used to manage  college  courses,  to  organize  field  offices,  to  deliver  product  lists  to  consumers,  and  to  organize  community  groups  and  clubs   Glossbrenner, 1984 . One excited hobbyist  proclaimed ‘10 years from now, people will  probably check their bulletin boards as often  as they check their mailboxes’  Seger, 1983 . Some  of  the  first  civic  applications  of  computer bulletin boards were implemented  by  public  agencies.  In  1981,  the  Chicago  Public  Library  became  the  first  library  to  offer a bulletin board system, logging close  to  1,000  calls  a  month  on  a  small  personal  computer  said  to  be  ‘the  only  Apple  in  town’  Dewey, 1984 . The board announced  upcoming  events,  included  movie  reviews  and  book  reviews  commissioned  by  free- lance writers, and encouraged users to down- load  public  domain  software  for  their  own  machines   Shea,  1984 .  Four  years  later,   20 libraries had rolled out some type of bul- letin board for their patrons  Dewey, 1986 .  In  1989,  the  city  of  Santa  Monica  created  the  Public  Electronic  Network   PEN   and  made  the  system  available  for  free  to  any- one living and working in the city. In addi- tion to dial-up BBS access, the system also  erected  public  terminals  in  libraries,  parks,  government  buildings,  and  senior  recrea- tion  centers.  Homeless  residents  used  the  network  to  educate  other  citizens  about  the  challenges  they  faced,  explaining  that   the  lack  of  showers,  clean  clothing,  and  a  place  to  store  belongings  makes  it  very  difficult  to  find  a  job   McKeown,  1991 .  Inspired  by  these  conversations,  a  coalition  of homeless and non-homeless users formed  a  network  called  SWASHLOCK   SHowers,    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     39  WASHers,  and  LOCKers   and  successfully  lobbied  the  Santa  Monica  City  Council  to  create  a  homeless  services  drop-in  center  that included job counselors and a PEN ter- minal  Kantor, 1992; Wittig, 1991 .  Individuals  and  small  activist  groups  were also excited by the way bulletin boards  could  be  used  to  engage  the  community.  In  Colorado  Springs,  a  retired  West  Point  instructor named Dave Hughes realized that  we  were  on  the  brink  of  ‘a  coming  global  revolution  in  human  communications.’  He  launched  a  BBS  called  Old  Colorado  City  Electronic  College  in  the  hopes  of  promot- ing  electronic  democracy.  A  few  months  later, when the city council proposed regula- tions that would stop residents from working  out  of  their  homes,  Hughes  encouraged  his  board’s  users  to  spread  word  of  the  contro- versial regulations  Rheingold, 1991 . More  than 175 citizens showed up at the next pub- lic meeting, and the ordinance went down in  flames.  ‘In  the  end,’  said  Hughes,  ‘the  city  council  never  knew  what  hit  them’   Kelly,  1984:  36 .  Meanwhile,  on  the  West  Coast,  a  group  of  antiwar  activists  affiliated  with  the Disarmament Resource Center created a  bulletin  board  called  PeaceNet   Rae,  1984 .  One  of  the  very  first  computer  networks  for  progressive  activists,  PeaceNet  eventu- ally  evolved  into  the  Institute  for  Global  Communications  and  served  ‘tens  of  thou- sands  of  individuals,  nonprofits,  and  pro- gressive causes in more than 130 countries’   Drew, 2013: 91 .  For  those  who  were  paying  attention  to  these  experiments,  it  was  clear  that  some- thing  exciting  was  underway.  Declaring  bulletin boards ‘a new and important subcul- ture,’  the  computer  scientist  Jacques  Vallee   1984  argued that user-generated content on  bulletin  boards  represented  a  revolutionary  paradigm  shift  because  ‘the  entertainment  value was provided by the people who con- tributed to its message base around the clock’   1984: 156 . More than one writer made the  logical  connection  to  Gutenberg’s  printing  press,  suggesting  that  the  rise  of  networked   personal computers was creating an entirely  new  medium  for  exchanging  information   Rheingold,  1991;  Wood  &  Blankenhorn,  1990 .  Bulletin  boards  and  online  systems  also  established  a  reputation  for  citizen  journal- ism. When the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake  hit  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area,  television  networks  encountered  technical  difficulties  and  were  slow  to  cover  the  crisis.  As  one  Washington Post reporter marveled, ‘the net- work  that  first  began  to  spread  the  news  of  the earthquake was the enormously energetic  world of personal computer bulletin boards.’  In the thousands of bulletin board messages  generated  after  the  quake,  people  assured  their loved ones that they were safe, shared  information about aftershocks, and provided  first-hand  accounts  of  the  damage  wrought  by the quake  Reid, 1989 . Optimists viewed  such developments as evidence of an emerg- ing ‘network nation’ in which citizens were  ‘linked electronically to one another through  the  medium  of  their  computers’   Kelly,  1984 .  Of course, not all residents of the network  nation were filled with love for their neigh- bors. Racist bulletin boards attracted the ire  of  Canadian  authorities  by  disseminating  anti-Semitic  tracts  and  files  claiming  that  the  Holocaust  was  a  hoax.  Canadian  cus- toms  authorities  blocked  physical  versions  of  these  documents,  but  digital  versions  could  travel  across  the  border  with  impu- nity  InfoWorld, 1984 .Glenn Miller, leader  of  the  North  Carolina  Klan,  created  Aryan  Nation Liberty Net to ‘press the Klan’s cause  and  out-maneuver  the  “Jewish-controlled  mass  media”’   Newsweek,  1984 .  Within  a  year, the network included the White Aryan  Resistance  BBS  in  California,  the  Aryan  Nations  BBS  in  Idaho,  two  KKK-linked  bulletin  boards  in  Texas,  and  a  KKK-node  in  North  Carolina. According  to  the  inves- tigative  journalist  Chip  Berlet   2001 ,  this  network was stitched together on Apple and  Radio  Shack  computers  running  standard  BBS software.   40  bulleTin board sysTems   in The mainsTream  At  the  start  of  the  Reagan Administration’s  second  term,  experts  estimated  that  there  were  well  over  2,000  boards  in  the  United  States  Spurrier, 1985 . This would not have  happened  without  the  passionate  commit- ment of system operators who devoted con- siderable amounts of their time and money:  approximately  two  hours  a  day  for  system  maintenance,  $3,000  for  startup  equipment  costs,  and  $50  a  month  to  keep  the  system  humming   Glossbrenner,  1984;  Information  Today,  1984 .  From  the  user  perspective,  BBS  software  was  increasingly  sophisti- cated,  greeting  visitors  with  color  menus,  blocky  computer  graphics,  and  even  sound   Stone, 1985 .  From  the  very  beginning,  bulletin  board  systems were used to distribute software. On  most bulletin boards, one could find libraries  of  public  domain  software  that  users  could  legally  download  and  install  on  their  own  computer. The term shareware was often used  to describe the games and utilities distributed  in this way. Developers shared software with  the community for free, encouraging users to  send a small amount of money if they found  the program to be useful. By 1992, there were  hundreds  of  thousands  of  shareware  pro- grams available for download  Green, 1992 .  Many  shareware  authors  were  able  to  make  a  decent  living  from  this  system,  and  ana- lysts estimated that the shareware market was  worth approximately $15 million  Earnshaw,  1989 .  It  would  be  misleading  to  suggest  that  all  of  the  software  distributed  online  fell into this category. On the fringes of the  BBS  scene,  boards  affiliated  with  the  com- puter underground made it possible for users  to  illegally  download  copyrighted  software  such as mainstream productivity applications  and high-end computer games.  Although  computing   technologies  are  sometimes viewed as the exclusive property  of  male  computer  hobbyists  in  their  early  20s, the bulletin-board scene was populated   by  a  wide  variety  of  users.  After  studying  usage figures from almost two-dozen library  bulletin  board  systems,  Dewey   1986:  16   noted,  ‘callers  more  and  more  are  reflect- ing  a  cross-section  of  people  who  normally  visit  libraries.’  System  operators  also  began  to  notice  that  a  significant  number  of  users  were  handicapped  or  elderly   Wood  &  Blankenhorn, 1990 . Because adaptive com- puting  technologies  helped  disabled  people  become  more  independent,  disabled  users  were  among  the  very  first  to  recognize  the  benefits of online communication  Markoff,  1983 .  For  similar  reasons,  bulletin  boards  also appealed to older users as a vehicle for  intellectual  stimulation  and  a  lifeline  to  the  outside  world   Evasuk,  1992 .  In  the  words  of  one  journalist,  ‘People  can  explore  their  town,  city,  or  even  the  world  without  ever  leaving their terminal’  Hoban, 1984 .  For many teenagers – both boys and girls –   bulletin  boards  were  a  vital  form  of  social  support. ‘Back then, if you had a modem and  were “connected,”’ recalls one member of the  teen BSS scene, ‘the BBS was a vital part of  your life. … Back before people were literally  living on the Internet, the BBS world was a  regular part of my life’  Chickenhead, 2004 .  As young people spent more and more time  in front of a computer screen, outreach work- ers used bulletin boards such as CyberCrisis  to connect with isolated teens in need of sup- port  Duvall, 1995 . A 13-year old girl in Del  Mar,  California,  launched  a  system  called  Teen Line that allowed teenagers to chat with  one  another  about  family,  school,  and  per- sonal  lives   Smith,  1985 .  The  response  to  such  efforts  was  overwhelmingly  positive,  particularly among shy teenagers who found  face-to-face  interaction  to  be  excruciatingly  difficult  Bula, 1993 .  As  is  often  the  case  with  teen  uses  of  emerging  technologies,  the  response  from  adults was mixed. Writing for The Futurist,  one  reporter  argued  that  teen-oriented  com- puter  bulletin  boards  provided  a  vital  form  of  social  support  while  also  ‘preparing  teenagers  for  their  future  business  lives’  in    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     41  a  workplace  that  would  soon  be  dominated  by personal computers  Smith, 1985 . Other  journalists  emphasized  that  ‘bulletin  boards  are addictive’  Seger, 1983: 216 , pointing to  the example of users who spent several hours  online each day  Hoban, 1984 . In Texas, one  teenager argued ‘electronic messaging can be  just as addicting as drugs or alcohol for teen- agers,’  blaming  his  compulsive  behavior  on  peer pressure  Smith, 1985: 28 .  The  diversity  of  the  BBS  scene  was  also  reflected in the sexual orientation of its mem- bers. Gay and lesbian users constituted ‘the  second wave of online pioneers,’ and in 1984  approximately  10%  of  the  nation’s  bulletin  board  systems  were  exclusively  focused  on  the gay community  Kohn, 1984 . A survey  conducted by  The Advocate, found that gay  citizens  were  four  times  more  likely  than  other Americans  to  own  a  ‘microcomputer’   O’Laughlin,  1983 .  ‘Computers  and  gay  people  have  both  been  around  for  a  long  time,’ argued Dave Kinnick  1989: 43  in the  pages  of  The  Advocate,  ‘but  only  recently  have  they  formed  this  intimate  union.  The  pairing has a lot going for it.’  Before  the  advent  of  the  BBS,  much  of  the gay scene revolved around bars in larger  cities. For many, bulletin boards were a wel- come alternative. They were accessible to gay  youth  who  could  not  legally  enter  the  bars,  they  were  accessible  to  older  gay  citizens  who felt alienated by the emphasis on physi- cal  beauty,  and  they  provided  much  needed  community for gays who lived in rural areas   Kinnick, 1989 . For many lesbians, bulletin  boards  were  a  welcome  source  of  interac- tion in a society that ‘takes to women’s bars  and meeting grounds even less kindly than it  takes to gay male meeting places’  Kinnick,  1989: 43 .  Similar social configurations were emerg- ing in the French computer network Minitel.  A  group  of  ‘self-avowed  lesbian  activ- ists’  called  Les  Goudous  Telematiques   the  GTs  used French bulletin boards to build a   virtual  community  that  ‘stretched  beyond  Paris  into  provincial  towns  and  villages’    Chaplin,  2014 .  Considering  the  effect  of  Minitel  on  the  gay  community,  Mattias  Duyves   1993   marveled  at  the  ‘amaz- ing  opportunities  the  little  machine  offered  for  the  making  of  personal  and  anonymous  contacts’  such  as  ‘a  change  in  sexual  part- ner,  the  financing  of  services  such  as  a  gay   radio  station  and  help  for  AIDS  sufferers’   1993: 194 .  The rise of commercial   online services  Although  bulletin  boards  were  reaching  an  increasingly  diverse  audience,  certain  con- straints  were  still  holding  the  technology  back.  For  many  years,  the  experience  was  stymied by the fact that BBS software could  only support one caller at a time, resulting in  constant busy signals. In an attempt to share  the wealth, sysops limited registered users to  a  certain  amount  of  session  time,  although  this was relatively easy to circumvent simply  by  creating  a  second  account   Spurrier,  1985 .  Frustrated  by  the  need  to  repeatedly  dial  the  same  number,  hobbyists  developed  auto-dialers that repeatedly called the phone  number  until  a  connection  was  established   Hoban, 1984 . In addition to these hassles,  many  users  were  intimidated  by  jargon  and  unfamiliar  terms  like  baud  rate,  protocol,  buffer, and Kermit  Randall, 1989 .  Partly  in  response  to  the  need  for  a  less  complicated  on-ramp,  commercial  online  services  began  building  steam  in  the  late  1980s. The three major players were Prodigy   a  joint  venture  between  CBS,  IBM  and  Sears, Roebuck and Company , CompuServe   originally  marketed  via  Radio  Shack  as  MicroNET , and GEnie  a service created by  General  Electric . All  three  services  offered  moderately  accessible  interfaces,  greater  breadth  and  depth  of  content,  more  toll- free phone numbers, and fewer busy signals   Freed,  1995 .  They  also  capitalized  on  the  growing fear of computer viruses, promising    42  users  that  all  of  the  software  downloaded  from their service would be completely trust- worthy  Schopp, 1993 . The major deterrent  to  using  these  services  was  the  hourly  con- nect charges  Rothman, 1987 . All three ser- vices charged peak hourly rates ranging from  $12 to $35 per hour.  Although they offered similar functionality,  the mainstream services had different brand  identities. Prodigy was viewed as too perme- ated with advertising, and driven by an over- riding profit ethic  Katz, 1993 . The network  also  developed  a  reputation  for  censorship  and enraged users by canceling the accounts  of  subscribers  who  complained  about  the  company’s  billing  structure   Takahashi,  1990 .  CompuServe  was  arguably  the  most  successful of the three services. Referred to  as  ‘the  computer  nerd’s  online  service,’  it  was  the  first  service  to  expand  into  Europe   Carlson,  2009;  Vaughan-Nichols,  2012 .  CompuServe claimed approximately 992,000  subscribers,  Genie  claimed  to  have  600,000  subscribers,  and  Prodigy  had  more  than  1.3  million  subscribers   James,  Wotring,  &   Forrest, 1995 .  During the 1992 campaign season, candi- dates on both sides of the aisle realized that  online  services  might  be  an  effective  way  of  communicating  with  voters.  Governor  Clinton and President Bush fielded questions  from  Prodigy  subscribers,  the  Clinton  cam- paign posted position papers to Compuserve  and  GEnie,  and  Jerry  Brown  engaged  in  online  discussions  with  CompuServe  and  Genie users  Campbell, 1993 . In one of the  first online polls of its type, Prodigy subscrib- ers voiced a narrow preference for Governor  Clinton  over  President  Bush   Bloomberg  News, 1992 . This was the first political cam- paign to be so clearly shaped by online inter- action, and pundits characterized candidates’  involvement  as  ‘an  electronic  town  hall  spanning the nation’  Schwartz, 1992 . Such  moves were hailed for the way they made it  possible for candidates to ‘bypass the editing  function of the traditional media and to reach  voters directly’  Campbell, 1993 .  bulleTin board sysTems   and sex  “Why do you think the net was born?” asked  the  cast  of  the  musical  Avenue  Q.  “Porn.  Porn.  Porn.”  Indeed,  historians  have  long  noticed the close relationship between sexu- ality  and  emerging  technologies,  with  one  scholar referring to pornographers as “shock  troops  of  advancing  technology”   Gross,  2010 .  Consider  the  case  of  the  printing  press. Originally used to publish Gutenberg’s  bible, it was soon applied to concerns of the  flesh with erotic works by Pietro Aretino and  Giulio  Romano  paving  the  way  for  genera- tions of pornographers. Or, consider the birth  of cinema. While it might sound hyperbolic  to argue that “production of erotic films com- menced almost immediately after the inven- tion  of  the  motion  picture,”   Pornographic  film, 2017 , the claim is not that much of a  stretch.  Within  two  years  of  the  very  first  public  motion  picture  screening,  Eugène  Pirou and Albert Kirchner’s Le Coucher de la  Mariée   1896   depicted  the  actress  Louise  Willy performing a scandalous strip tease in  the bathroom – one of the very first examples  of  erotic  film.  We  can  even  see  the  same  trend  in  the  case  of  the  humble  Polaroid  instant  camera.  Amateur  photographers  understood that “whatever happened in front  of the lens never needed to be seen by a lab  technician,” and this epiphany paved the way  for “camera club” sessions and thousands of  “naughty  first-generation  Polaroid  photos”   Bonanos, 2012 .  Considered  in  the  light  of  these  histori- cal  examples,  it  should  not  be  surprising  that bulletin board systems were remarkably  effective  tools  for  disseminating  erotica  and  pornography. By the 1990s, mainstream com- puter  magazines  regularly  included  pages   of  advertisements  touting  sex-oriented  bul- letin  boards.  Modems  were  still  slow,  so  low-resolution  pictures  and  videos  were  accompanied  by  racy  text  files.  A  Time  Magazine article titled ‘Orgies Online,’ esti- mated that more than half of the 46,000 small    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     43  bulletin boards offered ‘some form of digital  titillation’  and  described  an  Oregon-based  site  which  generated  $3.5  million  in  annual  revenue by charging for access to the system  operator’s  ‘bulging  database  of  R-rated  and  X-rated digital images and film loops’  Elmer- Dewitt, 1993 . One of the most well-known  systems was Rusty-N-Edie’s BBS. Launched  by ‘a couple burn-outs from the 60s,’ the site  boasted  ‘more  than  three  gigabytes  of  adult  graphics.’  The  system  operators  proclaimed  ‘We live by the three no’s: “No censorship, no  rules, no hassle”’  BBS Callers Digest, 1992 .  This was not without risk. A system operator  in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, was fined $500  and given two years’ probation on obscenity  charges  for  posting  files  that  were  deemed  ‘too graphic’  Wood & Blankenhorn, 1990 .  In  addition  to  distributing  erotic  images  and  stories,  bulletin  board  systems  also  hosted  steamy  electronic  mail  and  chat  ses- sions. Although newspapers could not resist  the temptation to draw attention to cybersex,  it  was  difficult  to  deny  that  cybersex  was  the  ‘safest  sex’  in  town   Chamberlin,  1991;  Lacey, 1992 . As with bulletin board systems  in  the  United  States,  entrepreneurs  recog- nized  that  networked  computers  could  be  used to service the adult imagination. Minitel  Rose  offered  up  chat  lines  for  every  possi- ble  niche,  and  some  users  spent  thousands  of francs each month on the service. Mattias  Duyves   1993   estimated  that  –  in  1987  –  approximately 200,000 erotic messages were  sent over Minitel each day. The Sunday Times  in London claimed ‘more than half the traf- fic [on Minitel] consists of calls from people  who are interested in sex’  Schofield, 2012 .  increasingly global reach  The  first  computerized  bulletin  boards  emerged  in  Berkeley  and  Chicago,  but  the  BBS scene was a global phenomenon. Sysops  began  to  form  large  ‘echo  networks’  which  shared files and discussion groups with other   systems  in  the  network.  With  this  type  of  network, one could transmit a message from  San Antonio  to  Beijing  in  just  a  few  days.  There  were  many  echo  networks,  including  Relaynet,  Interlink,  SmartNet,  and  Canada  Remote  Systems   Wood  &  Blankenhorn,  1990 , but FidoNet was by far the largest and  most  influential.  Described  as  ‘the  world’s  first   and  probably  last   amateur  computer  network  based  on  anarchism’   Sprouse,  1990 ,  FidoNet  was  created  by  a  ‘queer  punk’  media  activist  named  Tom  Jennings.  The  original  computer  bulletin  boards  were  digital  islands  that  could  only  support  one  user at a time, but Jennings’ FidoNet proto- col  transformed  the  BBS  landscape  into  a  global  network  of  interconnected  machines.  In this store and forward network, a system  operator in one location would send an enor- mous bundle of data over the telephone line  to  a  nearby  system  operator.  The  recipient  would add his or her messages to the bundle  of data, and then pass it on to the next system  operator. As Bush  1993  explained, ‘as calls  within a city of the United States are gener- ally free, but calls between cities are not, it  seemed  obvious  to  concentrate  the  intercity  traffic into one call per night.’ It is important  to note that much of this traffic cost money,  and – for the most part – it was system opera- tors who footed the bill for long distance and  toll charges  Sheppard, 2004 .  One of the most  remarkable things about  this  network  was  the  content-neutral  strat- egy  that  system  operators   sysops   used  to  minimize  long-distance  telephone  fees.  The  network only worked if sysops agreed to for- ward data packets to the nearest node, even if  the nearest BBS represented a radically dif- ferent point of view. Empowering an unlikely  alliance of groups on all sides of the politi- cal  spectrum,  FidoNet’s  philosophy  decou- pled  ideology  from  data  exchange.  Driven  by a vision of cooperative anarchy, Jenning’s  system  required  that   a   each  FidoNet  node  would  be  fully  self-sufficient,  and   b   each  node  could  ‘communicate  with  any  other  node without the aid or consent of technical    44  or political groups at any level’  Bush, 1993 .  In  many  ways,  this  was  the  human  equiva- lent  of  the  breakthrough  that  revolutionized  the modem: a protocol for exchanging infor- mation consciously decoupled from the con- straints  of  a  single  ideology  or  proprietary  operating system.  By  any  measure,  FidoNet  was  extraordi- narily  successful.  In  early  1985,  there  were  just  200  nodes.  In April  1993,  this  number  had climbed to 20,000. By 1996, more than  30,000  FidoNet  systems  connected  millions  of users around the world – a decentralized,  asynchronous framework that anticipated the  Internet. For the first time, hobbyists around  the  world  were  brought  into  contact  with  others who shared their unique interests. An  amateur chef in Santa Fe, New Mexico, might  post  a  question  and  receive  answers  from  a  kindred  spirit  in  Rome,  Italy   Scott,  1993 .  These  global  connections  fueled  innova- tion and cross-cultural knowledge exchange.  Programmers outside the United States were  thrilled to be connected with one another in  this way, arguing that before FidoNET they  would  have  waited  three  to  six  months  for  news of technical developments to filter into  their awareness. ‘The result,’ commented one  coder,  ‘is  that  any  programmer  in Australia  can be as up-to-date as any other programmer  in the world’  Powell, 1987 .  As  FidoNet  grew,  it  was  adopted  by  gov- ernment  agencies  such  as  the  National  Park  Service,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Association   NOAA ,  and  pri- vate corporations  Calvo, 1986 . The system  was  also  popular  among  the  nonprofit  com- munity  in  developing  countries   Borsook,  1996 ,  with  nodes  in  North  America,  Europe,  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  Asia,  Latin  America,  and  Africa   Bush,  1993 .  Commenting on the network’s impressive rate  of growth, one technology journalist predicted  that  ‘every  man,  woman  and  child  on  earth  will be connected by 2002’  Ginn, 1991 .  Similar  experiments  were  underway  across  the  Atlantic.  In  response  to  the  oil  shock  of  1973,  the  French  government   invested  significant  resources  in  revitaliz- ing  the  nation’s  telecommunication  infra- structure   Fletcher,  2002 .  France  Telecom  began  developing  Minitel  in  1977,  and  it  was released to the public in 1982  Chaplin,  2014 .  Originally  imagined  as  a  replace- ment  for  French  phone  directories,  Minitel  positioned  itself  as  an  information  utility   Dvorak,  2012 .  Citizens  could  use  the  free  terminals  to  buy  groceries,  send  messages,  read news updates, and pay bills  McClearn,  2012 .  Unlike  the  decentralized  ground-up  structure of the North American BBS scene,  Minitel  was  completely  top-down.  Service  providers were required to ask for permission  from  France  Telecom,  and  only  registered  newspapers were allowed to provide services  on the network  Schofield, 2012 .  In 1986, more than 3 million Minitel termi- nals were in use throughout France  Chaplin,  2014 . Eight years later, more than a third of  French citizens over the age of 15 had used  Minitel   Kling  &  Hill,  1997 .  However,  by  the  late  1990s,  the  system  seemed  increas- ingly  quaint  and  too  bureaucratic,  with  Le  Monde writing that ‘Minitel is more expen- sive  than  the  Internet,  more  crude  and  too  French’  McClearn, 2012: 12 . In June 2012,  France Telecom killed off the service, migrat- ing what was left of its information pages to  the Internet  Mailland, 2016 .  bulleTin board sysTems   and legal hassles  One challenge posted by an open communi- cation  system  was  that  no  one  ever  knew  what type of information would be published  online. When one patron posted death threats  against  Ronald  Reagan  on  a  library  BBS,  secret  service  agents  confiscated  the  dis- kettes as evidence in the case  Dewey, 1986 .  Thomas  Tcimpidis,  a  33-year-old  system  operator in Los Angeles, had his home raided  and  his  PC  seized  because  one  of  his  users  posted a list of telephone credit card numbers    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     45   Pollack,  1984 .  The  Tcimpidis  case  was  widely  viewed  as  a  turning  point.  System  operators realized that they faced legal con- sequences  –  fines  and  even  jail  time  –  for  illegal activity that occurred on their systems   Pemberton, 1985 .  In  the  early  1990s,  several  bulletin  board  systems encountered legal problems. In 1992,  arguing that the BBS was illegally distribut- ing copyrighted software to subscribers, FBI  agents  confiscated  personal  computers  and  modems that were used to power Davy Jones  Locker   Hyatt,  1992 .  The  system  operator  who ran the board was eventually sentenced  to  six  months  of  home  detention  and  two  years’ probation  Kleiner, 1995 . In 1993, the  Ohio-based  Rusty-N-Edie’s  was  raided  for  allegedly  distributing  copyrighted  software.  Despite protestations of innocence from the  sysops  and  subscribers  alike,  FBI  agents  confiscated  all  of  the  board’s  computers,  monitors, and hard drives  Nash & Lindquist,  1993 .  The  following  month,  Playboy  sued  the board’s operators for copyright infringe- ment, arguing that more than 412 download- able adult images had been illegally scanned  from  the  pages  of  Playboy.  The  case  was  eventually  settled  in  1998,  with  the  sysops  agreeing to pay $500,000 to resolve the law- suit  Associated Press, 1998 .  In 1990, the Secret Service raided the office  of  an  Austin-based  game  company,  seizing  computers, hard drives, floppy disks, modems,  monitors,  and  a  laser  printer.  No  employ- ees  of  the  game  company  were  arrested,  no  charges  were  filed,  and  there  were  no  for- mal  criminal  accusations   Sterling,  1992 .  Eventually,  the  Secret  Service  explained  that  one  of  the  company’s  employees  main- tained  a  separate  bulletin  board  system  that  focused  on  issues  related  to  the  computer  underground.  Although  most  of  the  confis- cated  equipment  was  eventually  returned,  the company was forced to lay off half of its  employees   Jackson,  2010 .  In  response  to  the troubling regulatory landscape that faced  sysops  and  ordinary  computer  users  alike,  John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor formed   the  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation  with  the  task  of  ‘assuring  the  application  of  the  US  Constitution to digital media’  Barlow, 1990 .  The Supreme Court agreed. In 1997, in Reno v.   ACLU,  they  agreed  that  the  Internet  was   protected by the First Amendment and should  be  treated  like  a  newspaper  rather  than  a  broadcast station.  The compuTer underground  Released in 1984, the movie War Games told  the story of a 15-year old hacker accidentally  bringing  the  world  to  the  brink  of  nuclear  war when he stumbled across a BBS linked  to  the  North  American  Aerospace  Defense  Command  NORAD . In addition to cement- ing  the  foundations  for  the  enduring  hacker  stereotype, War Games introduced viewers to  the  world  of  modems,  bulletin  boards,  and  auto-dialers. It also spawned a wave of anx- ious coverage of the hacker threat. Less than  a  year  later,  Emmanuel  Goldstein   a  pen  name for Eric Corley  launched the magazine  2600  to  document  the  emerging  computer  underground.  The term hacker typically connotes destruc- tive and illegal digital behavior, but this is not  the  only  meaning  of  the  term.  Others  argue  that  the  hacker  ethic  is  a  positive  stance,  characterized  by  a  commitment  to  sharing,  openness, decentralization, expanded access  to  technology,  and  the  creation  of  beautiful  things   Levy,  1984 . An  honest  observer  of  the computer underground that flourished on  bulletin  boards  would  have  to  concede  that  both types of hacker were actively involved  in the scene. Many users were simply moti- vated by curiosity and a desire to understand  new  things.  Others  were  engaged  in  piracy  and  driven  by  the  thrill  of  cracking  a  sup- posedly locked computer system. Some were  excited about all of these things.  Douglas  Thomas   2002   argues  that  bul- letin  board  systems  were  the  ideal  medium  for the emergence of an underground hacker    46  subculture. ‘Because of the difficulty in regu- lating  them   or  even  knowing  about  their  existence  and their ability to offer complete  anonymity  to  their  users,’  he  explains,  ‘the  boards  provided  the  ideal  “safe  space”  for  hackers to congregate, to share information,  learn from one another, and build their repu- tations’  Thomas, 2002: 119 . By 1984, there  were more than 200 hacking-themed boards  in  the  United  States  and  experts  estimated  that  computer  tampering  cost  up  to  $3  bil- lion  per  year   Myers,  1984 .  Underground  hacking  boards  distributed  pages  of  phone  numbers  for  ‘major  computers  around  the  country,’  including  ‘all  of  the  Fortune  500  companies  and  a  large  amount  of  military  systems’  Zap, 1988 .  In  addition  to  electronic  mail,  software  downloads, and discussion forums, most bul- letin  board  systems  included  an  area  where  users could download text files. For the most  part,  text  file  archives  contained  innocu- ous  documents  ranging  from  recipes  and  instruction manuals to adventure game walk- throughs, lists of bulletin board access num- bers, or articles about technology and popular  culture retyped by hand and uploaded to the  board. However, among the computer under- ground,  one  could  find  archives  of  T-files,  G-files  or  Philes  that  plowed  more  contro- versial ground: instructions on how to build  a  ‘blue  box’  that  could  be  used  to  make  free  international  phone  calls,  a  recipe  for  manufacturing  Methamphetamine  from  eas- ily  obtained  ingredients,  a  guide  on  how  to  override  software  copy  protection,  and  tips  for  making  nitroglycerin  from  nitric  acid,  wheat germ, and sodium bicarbonate  Scott,  2016 . As Jason Scott  2016  explains, ‘they  were textfiles of any sort, written to explain in  detail an important new computer discovery,  a great new concept, or an old piece of knowl- edge that needed to be passed on. It included  stories,  poems,  songs,  ramblings,  and  long  treatises  on  theories  that  the  writer  couldn’t  possibly have known. They were full of bra- vado,  of  half-truths,  of  promises,  and  occa- sionally, of brilliance that shines to this day.’  When hackers first appeared on the scene,  researchers realized that ‘nearly all are teen- age boys,’ and noted that many of their posts  were  sophomoric,  ‘strewn  with  profanities  questioning  the  masculinity  of  other  sys- tem users’  Schiffres, 1985 . Three decades  before the word doxing entered the popular  vocabulary,  bitter  users  decided  to  punish  Newsweek  reporter  Richard  Sandza  for  an  article  that  criticized  the  underground  BBS  scene. They published the journalist’s credit  card number and social security number on  the  boards,  allegedly  having  acquired  the  information  by  cracking  the  computers  of  the credit reporting agency TRW  Schiffres,  1985 .  Almost  from  the  very  beginning  of  the  BBS  scene,  system  operators  began  to  complain  about  immature,  thoughtless,  and  malevolent users  Hoffman, 1985; Spurrier,  1985 . The  system  operator  responsible  for  creating the first public library BBS told of  one high school that was forced to shut down  the BBS at the end of the day because stu- dents  flooded  them  with  vulgar  messages,  graffiti,  and  bank  access  numbers   Dewey,  1986 . In order to deny access to other users,  auto-dialers  were  used  to  tie  up  a  BBS  all  night, a retaliatory strategy ‘dreaded by sys- ops everywhere’  Dewey, 1986: 16 . During  this  period,  system  operators  complained  about  flame  wars  in  which  participants  exchanged  ‘unnecessarily  argumentative  or  antagonistic  messages.’  One  system  opera- tor  speculated  that  angry,  hateful  invective  was made easier by the fact that users could  not  actually  see  one  another  face  to  face   Wright, 1992 .  It  was  sophomoric,  vindictive  hackers  –  not  the  knowledge-seekers  –  who  captured  the  popular  imagination  in  much  that  was  written  about  the  computer  underground  in  the  1980s.  For  example,  the  ABA  Banking  Journal’s  the  Hacker  Attack’  argued that personal computers and modems  were  a  gateway  drug  on  the  road  to  com- puter  crime.  ‘Inevitably,  as  [BBS  users]  phone bills begin to rise,’ warned the article,  ‘they begin to look for ways to avoid paying   ‘Beware    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     47  long  distance  calls.’  Before  they  knew  it,  hackers  would  be  stealing  telephone  credit  card  access  numbers  to  fuel  their  addic- tion   Miller,  1984 .  In  1983,  seven  young  computer  enthusiasts  –  mostly  teenagers  –  were said to have penetrated computer sys- tems  at  the  Los  Alamos  Nuclear  Facility,  the  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Care  Center, and Pacific Security bank. Referred  to as 414s, based on their shared Milwaukee  area  code,  the  young  ‘bandits’  insisted  that  their worst transgression was creating a few  accounts named Joshua – a reference to the  movie War Games. Commenting on the inci- dent, one computer security expert compared  the  emergence  of  inexpensive  computers  to  a ‘flood’ of cheap, semi-automatic weapons   Covert, 1983 . Jacque Vallee  1984  argued  that the public loved this type of media cov- erage because ‘it is mysterious, full of tech- nical  intrigue  and  ingenious  plots,  and  its  victims  are  usually  big  companies,  giving  the  man  in  the  street  his  vicarious  revenge  over faceless institutions with their massive  computers’  1984: 136 .  The shorT-lived boom: inTerneT  killed The video sTar  With the introduction of Microsoft Windows  and  multi-tasking,  it  became  possible  to  handle  multiple  callers  simultaneously  on  a  single  personal  computer.  Although  this  reduced  computing  costs,  sysops  began  paying more for multiple telephone lines – a  trend  which  stimulated  the  rise  of  paid  bul- letin  board  systems   Fire  Escape,  1998;  Sheppard,  2004 .  For  example,  the  85-line  Channel 1 in Cambridge, MA, received more  than 2,500 calls a day and generated $20,000  each month  Berck, 1992 . However, system  operators  realized  that  their  businesses  did  not necessarily scale well. ‘The larger we get,  the more the problems of size are exposed,’  noted  one  successful  sysop   Hardenburgh,  n.d. .  In  addition  to  consuming  electricity,   computers generated so much heat that it was  necessary to ‘open the windows in the dead  of  the  Ohio  winter  to  keep  the  heat  under  control.’ Controlling heat during the summer  months  required  a  four-ton  air  conditioner  unit  and  three  huge  humidifiers  running  around  the  clock   Hardenburgh,  n.d. .  In  an  attempt to offset the costs of their business,  more  and  more  system  operators  adopted  complex  fee  structures  and  added  hundreds  of telephone lines. By the mid-1990s, indus- try  analysts  estimated  that  three  out  of  four  bulletin  boards  charged  subscription  fees   Scott, 1993 .  In the mid-1990s, the emerging BBS indus- try  was  described  as  a  $2  billion  industry  –   a  figure  that  include  revenues  from  paid  BBS  subscriptions  and  the  sale  of  affiliated  technologies  Metcalfe, 1994b . Making the  leap from ‘an obscure hobby’ to a ‘cultural  revolution’   Plotnikoff,  1995 ,  this  digital  landscape  was  home  to  more  than  60,000   bulletin  boards  and  approximately  17  mil- lion users  Metcalfe, 1994b . Meanwhile, the  software used to run the bulletin boards was  in high demand, and generated approximately  $20 million in sales each year  Berck, 1992 .  ‘Today,  the  word  hobby  hardly  applies,’  argued Lamont Wood and Dana Blankenhorn   1990   about  the  rise  of  for-profit  bulletin  boards.  ‘BBSes  are  a  way  of  life  for  thou- sands  of  people.  For  some,  it’s  a  business,  perhaps even a career’  1990: 298 .  This  way  of  life  was  about  to  be  extin- guished. As Randy Seuss noted, ‘once BBSers  were  able  to  leave  the  local  community  via  the Internet, it was unstoppable’  Zelchenko,  1998: para. 5 . In 1994, the New York Times  noted that the global Internet population had  nearly doubled in a single year, from 15 mil- lion to 25 million users  Pacheco, 1994 . The  sysop of a popular BSS The Ledge remembers  that,  in  1996,  ‘one  by  one,  my  subscribers  began to vanish and open up dial-up accounts  with  Internet  service  providers  that  were  popping  up  everywhere.’  Commenting  on  the ‘great migration’ of users to the Internet,  one  hobbyist   Fire  Escape,  1998   observed    48  ‘many sysops are currently just holding their  breath and veering their eyes, hoping that the  Internet will just “go away”.’ It did not. One  industry pundit grudgingly conceded that the  world-wide web was “the BBS of the future”   Rickard, 1994 .  Arguing that bulletin board systems were  on the brink of a comeback, one sysop opti- mistically predicted that ‘we can all sit back  and watch the bloated internet crumble under  its  own  weight  while  our  dialup  customers  continue to call BBS’s like they have done for  over  a  decade!’   Robbins,  1996 . The  com- puter  journalist  Bill  Machrone   1995   pre- dicted that the biggest Internet groups would  ‘collapse  under  their  own  weight’  because  people would ‘prefer their local BBS, a place  like  Cheers   where  everybody  know  your  name   –  even  if  the  BBS  becomes  a  web  site’   1995:  83 .  Offering  one  of  the  most  unique reasons to resist the Internet, William  Zachmann   1991   argued  that  ‘electronic  mail is inherently exclusionary’ because it is  only delivered to the recipient s , reinforcing  corporate ‘chain of command’ and hierarchi- cal communication channels. In contrast, the  BBS approach was said to make information  available  to  everyone   1991:  95 .  The  con- trolled environment of e-mail, said the jour- nalist, appeals to ‘those who are incompetent  or simply lazy’  1991: 95 .  Motivated  by  a  combination  of  despera- tion and profit, the largest bulletin board sys- tems  transformed  themselves  into  Internet  Service  Providers   Metcalfe,  1994a;  Rubin,  1995 . As  with  the  growth  of  the  telephone  and radio industries in the previous century,  these  small-scale  operations  had  little  hope  of  competing  with  corporate  giants.  The  lucky ones were acquired during the Internet  boom;  others  simply  shuttered  their  doors.  Perhaps most telling,  Boardwatch  the flag- ship journal of the BBS community  replaced  its  regular  list  of  BBS  phone  numbers  with  a  column  that  profiled  interesting  web  sites   Romonesko, 1996 .  Outmatched  by  ‘the  glitz  and  resources  of  the World Wide Web,’  the  small  bulletin   boards struggled to stay afloat  Romonesko,  1996: 1E . System operators for the remain- ing boards reported that their users primarily  connected to the system for sentimental rea- sons. Commenting on the death of the scene,  an 84-year-old computer hobbyist explained,  ‘BBSs became web pages. The web became  one big BBS, or a million tiny ones, depend- ing on how you look at it’  Zelchenko, 1998:  para. 2 .  conclusion  This chapter focused primarily on the social  and cultural topography of the bulletin board  scene, with only passing attention to particu- lar  technical  details.  However,  the  connec- tion  between  the  BBS  and  contemporary  social media is directly tied to the significant  ways  that  computing  tools  have  changed  in  recent  decades.  It’s  not  just  that  computers  are  more  powerful  each  year  –  it’s  the  fact  that the rate of change itself is speeding up.  Kurzweil  2001: para 1  calls this ‘exponen- tial growth in the rate of exponential growth.’ Modem  speeds  are  measured  in  ‘baud’  or  ‘bits  per  second.’ When  Christensen  and  Seuss  developed  the  first  bulletin  board  in  1977,  they  used  a  modem  that  was  capable  of  transferring  300  bits  per  second.  This  works  out  to  approximately  42  characters  per  second  –  less  than  one  third  the  length  of a typical tweet. As with processing power  and storage space, the pace of improvements  in  connection  speeds  was  astonishing.  Each  new version was at least twice as fast as its  predecessor,  the  amount  of  time  between  releases shortened, and overall costs steadily  declined.  For  much  of  the  BBS  scene,  computer  networks  were  primarily  used  to  exchange  chunks of text. Suddenly, modems were fast  enough  to  exchange  low-resolution  images  and  blocky  computer  graphics.  Computer  networks became vehicles for visual commu- nication. By the early 1990s, it was possible    early soCial CoMPuting: the rise and Fall oF the bbs sCene  1977–1995     49  to  transfer  audio  files  and  even  short  video  clips over a dial-up connection. The content  was pixelated, but the image quality was irrel- evant. The network was absorbing the char- acteristics of global broadcasters. This might  seem quaint in a contemporary world in which  teenagers carry high-definition supercomput- ers known as cellphones and Internet Service  Providers  are  rolling  out  one-gigabit-per-  second connection speeds  Glaser, 2016 . Not  so long ago, though, these technological devel- opments  were  unthinkable.  Contemporary  connection  speeds  are  more  than  three  mil- lion  times  faster  than  the  modem  that Ward  Christensen and Randy Seuss used to power  their first computer bulletin board.  Why does this matter? It matters because  this  is  the  key  that  helps  us  recognize  the  enduring characteristics of our social media  landscape.  Our  contemporary  media  land- scape  has  changed  considerably  during  the  past  two  decades. At  first  glance,  the  world  of  BBS  users  seems  so  radically  different  than the world of users camped out on popu- lar  social  media  platforms.  But  the  current  communication  landscape  is  exactly  what  one might expect would happen to the BBS  scene  when  you  fold  in  connection  speeds  that are three million times faster than origi- nal  modems,  computer  processors  that  are  345,000 times more powerful than the Apple  II  that  powered  the  BBS  in  the  Chicago  Public  library   Morgan,  2014 ,  and  an  eco- system that has grown 100-fold from approx- imately 30 million digitally networked users  in  1990  to  3.3  billion  digitally  networked  users in 2016.  Whether sending messages, talking about  politics,  playing  games,  consuming  sto- ries,  or  downloading  content,  contemporary  computer  users  are  doing  the  exact  same  things online that they did in the 1980s. The  machines  are  faster,  the  graphics  are  better,  and  computers  have  insinuated  themselves  ever  further  into  the  nooks  and  crannies  of  our daily lives, but the human desire to inter- act with other human beings stays the same.  The drive to communicate endures.  Notes   1   Although bulletin board systems facilitated infor- mation  exchange,  most  users  only  downloaded  software,  images  and  text  files.  Only  a  handful  actually  uploaded  files,  and  –  of  those  –  only  a  small  percentage  uploaded  original  content   Hoffman, 1985 .   2   Luckily  for  communication  historians  and  com- puter hobbyists of all stripes, Scott has dedicated  an  enormous  amount  of  energy  to  archiving  thousands of text files from 1980 through 1995.  references  Associated Press  1998  Owners of Internet site  settle  with  ‘Playboy’  over  use  of  photos.

She  notes  that  older  forms  of  media  like  televi- sions and telephones have always had social  applications and that a range of earlier Internet  functions have long enabled ‘connecting with  friends and family, discovering what is going  on in the world [and] sharing and expressing  what maters’  Baym, 2015: 1 . For Baym, the  rise of the term ‘social media’ is more about the  corporatization of the Internet and the manner  in  which  companies  such  as  Facebook  have  developed platforms that ‘harness what people  were  already  doing’  and  turned  these  prac- tices into ‘revenue streams’  Baym, 2015: 1 .  She notes many of the drawbacks of the cor- porate model of social networking, not least  its  domination  by  a  few  venture-capitalist  companies whose ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ terms   of service divest users from their content and  promote cultures of mass surveillance where  individuals  lose  control  over  their  data.  We  need a better model for rethinking communi- cation  media,  she  concludes,  not  one  that  treats ‘humans as data profiles to be matched  with advertisers’  2015: 2 .  Baym’s well-founded critique of the devel- opment of the term ‘social media’ as well as  the  commercialism  that  underpins  today’s  immensely  popular  and  revenue-producing  platforms is based on the American experience.  Indeed, Baym notes that some of the world’s  most  successful  social  media  platforms  have  been developed by ‘small groups of  usually    young   White   American  men’  2015: 1 .  But  we  are  moving  away  from  a  time  when  discussions about the Internet and the effects  of its myriad applications can be discussed or  judged  from  an  exclusively  North American   or even wider Anglophone  perspective.  As emergent research is illustrating, there  is  a  wide  range  of  social  media  platforms  that  have  been  established  and  developed    54  across  many  different  countries.  Many  of  these  social  media  ventures  have  their  own  specific antecedents in earlier Internet tech- nologies  and  cultures,  including  bulletin  board  systems   BBS ,  chat  rooms,  mes- saging  platforms,  mobile  social  software   ‘mososo’ ,  web  cultures,  and  so  on.  Quite  a  number  of  social  media  platforms  and   forms  –  especially  national  social  media  –  have had relatively limited careers, especially  with  the  advent  of  the  present  global  and  regional titans of Weibo, Twitter, Facebook,  Instagram,  WeChat,  and  others.  Other  social media platforms still have substantial  national,  cross-national,  and  regional  user  bases,  significance,  and  cultural  influence.  Leading examples include the Russian social  media  network  Vkontakte   В  Контакте   known as VK, the African MixIt messaging  software, and the Korean ‘over-the-top’ chat,  messaging,  and  digital  culture  apps  Kakao  Talk  and  Line   which  took  over  from  the  pioneering  Cyworld .   ‘Over-the-top’  is  the  term  for  text,  audio,  and  video  applications  that deliver content and connectivity via the  Internet,  across  different  devices  –  without  the  involvement  of  infrastructure  or  access  operators .  There  are  also  some  very  interesting  and  important  historiographic  questions  to  ask  when social media are inaugurated in differ- ent places  cf. Lee, 2016 and Brügger, 2013 ,  where  we  discern  the  ‘breaks’  or  how  we  understand  ‘continuity’,  or,  indeed,  how  we  make  sense  of  the  persistence  of,  say,  BBS  in  some  countries   China,  Taiwan,  Turkey   and  the  greater  prominence  of  blogs  in  some  countries  and  contexts   Iran,  Taiwan    Goggin  &  McLelland,  2017a .  How  do  we  understand  the  interplay  among  differ- ent  media  forms,  formats,  and  preferences,  in  the  kind  of  ‘remediations’  that  particular  facets  of  social  media  represent?  Mobile  phones have a greater role in the social media  histories  of  some  countries   Japan,  Korea,  Indonesia, India, Burma  than others, where  PCs might be decisive at particular points; or  the prominence of the press might parlay into   some  social  media  forms  taking  on  notable  social, cultural, and political functions.  Such  apparently  historiographic  issues  in  the  development  of  social  media  take  on  heightened importance when we consider the  uses and abuses of taken-for-granted, or even  unnoticed,  histories.  Consider,  for  instance,  the  ways  that  particular  kinds  of  histories  help us imagine, invent, domesticate, use or  resist,  and  deploy  ideas,  values,  and  frame- works for how we see, relate to, and live with  social  media.  These  kinds  of  social  imagi- naries  have  been  drawn  to  our  attention  by  the important work of Internet historians and  scholars such as Janet Abbate  1999 , Patrice  Flichy  2007 , Sandra Braman  2011, 2012 ,  Fred Turner  2006 , Thomas Streeter  2011 ,  Robin Mansell  2012 , and others. However,  we are only at the early stage of document- ing,  theorizing,  and  debating  non-Western  and alternative Internet imaginaries, let alone  social media imaginaries.  Thus  a  basic  sense  of  the  range,  impor- tance, and influence of these alternative his- tories  of  social  media  is  vital,  if  we  are  to  understand – not misconstrue – the contempo- rary dynamics of social media. Accordingly,  in  this  chapter,  which  draws  on  our  earlier  work  aimed  at  internationalizing  Internet  studies  and  reframing  the  Internet  in  terms  of its global histories  Goggin & McLelland,  2009 & 2017b , we discuss a range of alter- native  histories  of  social  media  outside  the  usual  North  American  and  European  para- digms. In particular, we examine two distinct  though  also  related  Asian  cases:  Japan  and  China. Japan and China are significant case  studies  for  several  reasons.  First,  both  were  perceived as coming late to the Internet age,  having  to  overcome  complex  coding  prob- lems  for  the  input,  transfer  and  display  of  Han   Chinese   characters,  which  the  scripts  of both languages share. Both societies also  largely missed out on the stage of office auto- mation,  particularly  the  use  of  typewriters,  which were typical of mid-twentieth century  business  environments  in  North  America  and  Europe.  There  was  consequently  less    alternative histories oF soCial Media in JaPan and China  55  familiarity with the keyboard as a text input  medium  requiring  the  development  of  ‘new  literacy  and  communication  practices  dif- ferent  from  the  US’   Sugimoto  &  Levin,  2000:  137 .  However,  once  these  coding  issues had been resolved, both societies took  to  computer-mediated  communication.  By  2000,  approximately  30%  of  the  Japanese  population  were  using  the  Internet,  with  93%  by  2015   ITU,  2016 .  China’s  usage  climbed from 1.78% of the population using  the  Internet  in  2000,  to  approximately  28%  in  2009,  and  50%  by  2015   ITU,  2016 .  In  relative  terms,  Japanese  share  of  Internet  usage  has  slipped  down  the  global  scale  as  global language users of Spanish, Arabic and  Portuguese  increasingly  come  online,  while  Chinese  users  represent  the  second  most  prevalent  population  with  the  largest  num- ber of Internet users in any country  Internet  World Stats, 2016a, 2016b; ITU, 2016 .  Each  case  has  its  own  complex  dynam- ics,  but  there  are  interesting  comparisons  and  contrasts  to  be  made.  Taken  together,  we  hope  that  this  two-country  comparative  discussion illustrates the importance and pro- ductiveness  of  generating  alternative  social  histories  to  the  dominant  accounts  –  which  tend  to  assume,  to  their  peril,  that  Western  social media platforms and corporations have  trumped their non-Western counterparts.  Japan  Japan is significant for any history of social  media  because,  despite  the  relatively  slow  development  of  PC-based  Internet  culture  during the 1990s, the mobile Internet took off  exponentially  at  the  turn  of  the  century  –  driven  largely  by  young  people’s  desire  for  enhanced connection via cell phones. Indeed,  there  is  a  marked  difference  between  the  kinds of reports about Japan’s adoption of the  Internet that appear in computing magazines  pre-  and  post-1999.  It  was  in  that  year  that  NTT’s   Japan’s  largest  telephone  company   and  network  provider   rolled  out  its  i-mode   that  is,  information  or  Internet-mode   cell  phones that anticipated many of the functions  of today’s smartphones by several years. The  innovation  of  the  i-mode  system  that  saw  Internet connectivity skyrocket in Japan tends  to be what is now remembered, at least in the  Anglophone literature, about Japan’s Internet  history. It was the roll out of mobile Internet  and the pioneering handsets and applications  developed  for  them  that  got  Japan  ‘back  in  the  race’   Coates,  2000 .  However,  prior  to  1999  the  discourse  about  Japan  and  the  Internet in magazines such as Wired was very  much framed in terms of bureaucratic incom- petence, missed opportunities and ‘catch-up’  based on American models  see, for example,  Abate, 1996; Johnstone, 1994 .  The  problem  with  these  accounts  is  that  they  were  so  fixated  on  pointing  out  what  Japan  was  not  doing   in  terms  of  models  already  developed  in  the  USA   that  they  missed what was actually going on – in par- ticular  the  important  cultural  and  techno- logical steps that had to be taken in Japan in  order for computer-mediated communication   CMC ,  particularly  online  socializing,  to  become  widely  intelligible  and  acceptable  among  the  general  population.  Although  it  is arguable that on a bureaucratic level there  were  indeed  many  missed  opportunities   Contreras,  2014 ,  the  grassroots  appropria- tion  of  CMC  in  Japan  was  pioneering  in  a  Japanese  context  –  and,  importantly,  was  always already ‘social’.  One  reason  why  a  highly  developed   technological  society  such  as  Japan  came  relatively  late  to  the  Internet   the  first  pub- licly  accessible  service  provider  did  not  commence  till  1993   was  the  necessity  of  developing software and transmission proto- cols  for  the  input  and  display  of  a  complex  character-based  script.  Closely  aligned  with  these  encoding  difficulties  was  the  fact  that  Japan had not gone through the same kind of  office  automation  characteristic  of  Western  societies. Although in the Western context the  movement from manual typewriter to electric    56  typewriter  to  personal  computer  was  fairly  seamless  –  given  that  the  QWERTY  key- board  remained  the  main  human–machine  interface on all these devices – the lack of a  standardized  input  and  display  system  pre- sented a challenge to users of non-alphabet- based Asian languages  Contreras, 2014 .  Although  a  system  that  allowed  users  to  input  Japanese  text  phonetically  using  the  QWERTY keyboard and then press a conver- sion key to show various options in Japanese  script on screen had been developed in 1979,  computer literacy remained low in Japan for  the  next  decade.  This  was  partly  because  there were no standard conversion protocols,  meaning computer companies developed their  own mutually incompatible systems, making  it  difficult  to  network  devices   Contreras,  2014; Seo, 2013: 186 . There was also some  cultural  resistance  to  reproducing  personal  communication via mechanical means, some  older  people  complaining  that  printed  char- acters were ‘“cold” and lacked individuality’   Gottlieb, 2000: 136–137 .  Japan’s  earliest  computer  networks  were  established  around  1985  and  included  Keio  University  academic,  Jun  Murai’s  JUNET   Japan  UNIX  Network ,  which  estab- lished  links  between  one  private  and  two   public  universities,  an  American-Japanese  collaboration  known  as  TWICS,  which  catered mainly to English-language users, and  Japan’s  first  major  local  network,  Computer  Communication  of  Oita  Amateur  Research  Association  COARA . The last was a public- private enterprise initially aimed at network- ing  local  businesses  to  encourage  regional  revitalization  established  in  Oita  province  of  Japan’s  south-western  island  of  Kyushu.  However,  by  the  late  1980s,  two  computer  companies,  NEC  and  Fujitsu,  had  been  established and were successfully marketing  pasokon ts¯ushin or ‘personal computer com- munication’ networks utilizing the telephone  line and modems. These were basically bulle- tin board systems  BBS  that enabled users to  seek out information from various news feeds  as well as participate in online discussions and   send email to other users – but, in the early  years  at  least,  only  with  those  on  the  same  system. Yet, once computerized communica- tion became more available, it proved popu- lar,  with  commentators  noting  that  the  new  ‘w¯apuro  ningen’   word-processer  human   was likely to write more, and to write more  often  Gottlieb, 2000: 141, 147–148 .  At  this  time  reports  in  the  Anglophone  press, which focused on bureaucratic infight- ing  and  the  tardiness  with  which  telephone  infrastructures  and  payment  systems  were  responding  to  consumer  demand,  missed  what was actually happening on the ground  in  Japan  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s.  This was still a time when Japan’s computer  networks  largely  functioned  as  ‘intranets’  since the necessary protocols to connect with  the global Internet were not yet in place, in  part  to  do  with  the  lack  of  standard  proto- cols for the input and conversion of Japanese  script  Fouser, 2001; Nishigaki, 1998 . Many  commentators  were  simply  oblivious  as  to  how  fundamental  Roman  script  was,  in  the  form  of  the  American  Standard  Code  for  Information  Interchange   ASCII ,  which  was literally built into the architecture of the  Internet,  including  programming  languages  as well as domain names and web addresses   Pargman & Palme, 2009 .  Japanese scholarship was, however, clear in  recognizing the arrival of new and potentially  revolutionary  forms  of  communication  –   often  captured  by  the  transliterated  term  ‘network’  nettow¯aku  – including Kumon’s   The  Network  Society   1988 ,  Kawakami’s   The  Social  Psychology  of  Electronic  Networking  1993 , and Yamane’s Declaration  of  a  Network  Republic   1996 .  These  and  other important analyses were clear that the  ‘networking’  taking  place  via  these  com- puter systems was very much about person- to-person communication and not at all like  the  one-to-many  mode  of  information  dis- semination characteristic of traditional mass  media   Izumi,  1996 .  The  realization  that  CMC offered the potential for a wide range  of people with divergent experiences to come    alternative histories oF soCial Media in JaPan and China  57  together  online  in  ‘people-to-people,  two- way  communication’  encouraged  even  sites  originally  founded  with  business  applica- tions  in  mind  to  broaden  their  user-base,  as  happened  with  COARA  which  became  a  ‘network  community’  for  local  residents  as  early  as  1987   Izumi,  1996:  5;  Rheingold,  1993:  205–206 .  As  Toru  Ono,  one  of  the  network’s founders, pointed out in his book,  The COARA Electric Nation: How Computer  Communication Makes the Regional Global,  ‘knowledge’ is not simply about information  exchange  but  emerges  from  human  interac- tion   Ono,  1994:  62 .  Similarly  TWICS,  the  main  English-language  network  at  this  time,  was,  according  to  its  systems  opera- tor, always ‘oriented more toward people and  communication rather than data and informa- tion’  cited in Rheingold, 1993: 215 .  These  early  networks  were  extremely  important  in  building  a  community  con- sciousness  among  various  constituencies,  notably  feminist  women  and  those  facing  adversity, such as parents of still-born infants  and those suffering chronic illness  Tamura,  2017 .  They  were  also  key  in  developing  communication  among  otherwise  dispersed  sexual minorities, such as transgender people   the Eon BBS founded in 1990  and gay men   Gay Net Japan, founded in 1988, grew out of  contacts made via the TWICS network .  Although these early networks were impor- tant in normalizing the idea of CMC in Japan  and crucial in bringing about a new kind of  online sociality, they were not taken up by the  population as a whole. By 1995, for instance,  the two largest commercial networks – NEC’s  PC-Van  founded 1986  and Fujitsu’s Nifty- Serve   founded  1987   –  had  only  around  a  million users each. This was due to a num- ber of factors, not least an inflexible pricing  system set by the fixed-line providers and the  non-intuitive  means  of  inputting  Japanese  text using the Roman alphabet. A 1997 sur- vey found that in Japan 50.8% of respondents  indicated they had never used a computer in  comparison to 21.8% of Americans  Fouser,  2001:  274 .  It  is  no  surprise,  then,  that  in   Japan,  the  PC  did  not  emerge  as  the  main  interface through which the mass of consum- ers first accessed the Internet. Rather, a range  of hand-held and mobile devices has proven  more popular. The different orthographies in  the  East  Asian  region  necessarily  impacted  upon the take-up of computerization in gen- eral and the Internet in particular, and led to  different developmental trajectories and pat- terns  of  use  that  diverge  in  many  important  ways  from  those  characteristic  of  the  USA  and Europe.  The importance of understanding the partic- ular developmental trajectories of the mobile  Internet in Japan is highlighted by the popu- larity  in  the  mid-1990s  of  paging  devices  among high-school girls. Okada  2005  notes   how  in  the  mid-1990s  schoolgirls  in  Japan  appropriated paging devices originally devel- oped  for  the   male   business  market,  using  the keypad on telephones to send simple text  messages to the LCD displays of friends’ pag- ers. This led to a distinct poke-kotoba  pager- lingo   among  the  subculture  and  assisted  young people in organizing their private lives  outside  parental  supervision  and  control.  This  innovative  use  of  pagers  ‘created  new  literacy  practices  among  young  Japanese  people’  Sugimoto & Levin, 2000: 138  and  impacted upon the functions of early models  of cell phones known as keitai  literally ‘car- ried in the hand’  in Japanese, which included  SMS  services  and,  from  1999,  via  i-mode,  Internet-enabled  email  which  allowed  sub- scribers  to  write  longer  messages  and  also  include graphics, audio, video and web links   Matsuda, 2005: 35 . The success of i-mode  can partly be put down to its use of a modi- fied  form  of  HTML,  allowing  for  increased  data speed that enhanced the functionality of  the  handsets  and  the  kinds  of  services  that  were on offer. Young people’s use of the ser- vice was also innovative in the development  of a wide range of text-based emoticons that  could  be  added  to  email  to  overcome  the  perception that computer-based communica- tion was somehow impersonal  Sugimoto &  Levin, 2000: 144–146 .   58  In  Japan,  the  rapid  uptake  in  mobile  Internet was driven by the desire for ‘social  media’  among  the  youth  market.  Mobile  Internet providers were further able to appeal  to a youth market by circumventing the high  cost of accessing the Internet due to fixed-line  charges  via  an  innovative  payment  system  where browsing was free but the user paid per  packet  downloaded  to  the  phone,  receiving  an itemized bill each month  Okazaki, 2006 .   A range of other services, such as subscrip- tions  to  news  sites,  ticket  purchases  and  music  downloads,  took  advantage  of  this  billing method, obviating the need for credit  cards.  Given  the  long  commute  times  in  Tokyo,  this  encouraged  commuters  to  surf  the  Internet  via  their  keitai  screens,  updat- ing their websites, engaging in chat, looking  up news and sports, TV and show schedules,  downloading music and ring tones, and send- ing  recommendations  to  friends  via  email.  The  keitai  also  saw  an  innovation  in  input  method  for  the  Japanese  language,  using  a  limited  numerical  keypad  where  each  num- ber on the pad is associated with a sequence  of phonetic kana syllables, such as – ka, ki,  ku, ke, ko – with the desired syllable being  selected  according  to  the  number  of  button  presses.  Once  the  phonetic  spelling  of  the  desired  term  is  visible  on  screen,  conver- sion to the required kanji  Chinese character   can be achieved by the use of an arrow but- ton,  allowing  the  entire  process  to  be  navi- gated just by using one thumb – giving rise  to  the  moniker  yubi-zoku  or  ‘thumb  tribe’  to describe young people who soon became  proficient in this input style.  Indeed,  since  2000,  the  uptake  among  young  people  of  mobile  connection  to  the  Internet  has  been  evident  across  East  Asia  and  has  resulted  in  a  ‘juvenation’  of  the  technology,  that  is,  a  movement  away  from  a  business  model  of  mobile  telecom- munications  towards  a  model  that  focuses  on  young  people’s  recreational  patterns  of   use – SMS, gaming, ring tones, downloads,  and  so  on.  This  movement  has  very  much  been dominated by young people’s desire for   connection with each other, to stay abreast of  the latest trends, and to communicate about  topics  important  to  them. While  not  unique  to  Japan   since  Japanese  patterns  of  usage  are similar in some respects to South Korea ,  it is clear that pre-existing Japanese cultural  norms  and  practices  exerted  a  strong  influ- ence  on  the  development  of  keitai  technol- ogy and its deployments. In Japan  and to an  extent in other East Asian societies , mobile  telephony, unlike the Internet, was not ‘con- ceived by an elite and noncommercial tech- nological priesthood and disseminated to the  masses’ but emerged out of young Japanese  consumers’  love  of  ‘gadget  fetishism  and  technofashion’  Matsuda, 2005: 9 .  The  astonishing  uptake  of  the  mobile  Internet  in  Japan,  from  only  one  million  i-mode  subscribers  in  1999  to  over  40  mil- lion  in  2003   Okazaki,  2006:  127 ,  is  also  related  to  a  host  of  other  specific  factors,  not  least  the  problematic  blurring  of  public  and  private  space  occasioned  by  the  advent  of the mobile phone. In Japan, spoken com- munication  via  mobiles  that  takes  place  ‘in  public’ on buses and trains is frowned upon  and needs to be handled with particular deco- rum. As Matsuda  2005: 24  points out, ‘The  physical  noise  is  not  the  problem.  Rather,   keitai conversations disrupt the order of urban  space’ by confusing the boundaries of private  and  public.  Okabe  and  Ito   2005   point  out  how from 1996, when young people became  the main demographic to take up the mobile  phone, there developed a voluble media dis- course about their use in public settings. One  way around this impasse is of course the use  of SMS and email, which can be used with  limited  disturbance  to  those  around,  once  again emphasizing the very social nature of  the  technology  –  enabling  private  conversa- tions to take place in public.  Although, as we have seen above, Internet  uptake  in  Japan  was  always  already  social  from  the  initial  roll-out  of  ‘personal  com- puter  communications’  in  the  late  1980s,  it  was  the  widespread  adoption  of  the  mobile  Internet at the turn of the century that saw the    alternative histories oF soCial Media in JaPan and China  59  population of Japanese Internet users surge.  Japan’s  forward-looking  i-mode  system  and  specially  designed  handsets  anticipated  the  smart phone by several years, and normalized  the use of keyboard and screen for the navi- gation and communication of both commodi- ties and personal information. Japan’s keitai  did not evolve out of an established culture of  PC use, but instead owed their success to the  innovative ways in which young people were  already using technologies such as pagers to  send messages and keep in contact – pointing  to a very different evolution of social media  from  that  which  is  familiar  to  us  from  the  USA or Europe.  china  The case of China is pertinent to our discus- sion  of  alternative  histories  of  social  media,  not only because it has the largest number of  social  media  users  in  the  world,  but  also  because  of  its  self-sustained  social  media  ecosystem enabled by an enormous ‘intranet’.  This gigantic intranet, which is protected by  the  notorious  ‘Great  Firewall’,  screens  out  most  of  the  world’s  popular  social  media  applications   such  as  Facebook,  Twitter,  Instagram,  and  YouTube ,  as  well  as  many  other Western websites that are deemed harm- ful  to  China  and  the  Chinese  people.  Scholarship  on  Internet  censorship  in  China  is abundant, with some researchers focusing  on the technologies and features of the cen- sorship and governance regime, some on the  dichotomy  between  control  and  resistance,  and  some  on  its  international  impact  and  implication.  There  has  been  an  increased  public-private  alliance  in  constructing  a  ‘healthy’  and  ‘civilized’  Internet,  that  is,  a  sanitized and pacified online environment in  China   e.g.,  Lagerkvist,  2011 .  It  is  beyond  the scope of this chapter for an informed dis- cussion  of  the  dynamics  and  nuances  of  Chinese  Internet  control  and  the  censorship  regime.  Suffice  to  say  that  such  Internet   censorship  turns  out  to  be  a  blessing  for  domestic  Internet  Service  Providers,  whose  copycat versions of global Social Networking  Systems  SNS  are both improved and local- ized  products  that  are  now  able  to  compete  with their Western counterparts. The Chinese  social  media  market  is  currently  dominated  by  five  applications:  QQ   granddaddy   of  Chinese  social  media ,  Qzone   father   of  Chinese  social  media ,  WeChat   Chinese  replacement  of WhatsApp , Weibo   Chinese  replacement  of  Twitter ,  and  Renren    Chinese  replacement  of  Facebook .   The  brief  descriptions  of  the  major  social  media  platforms  in  brackets  indicate  only  their  major functions. They are all cross-platform  social  media  and  social  commerce  applica- tions  akin  to  a  hybrid  of Twitter,  Facebook,  WhatsApp,  eBay,  and  YouTube.   There  are  many  other  SNSs  competing  for  niche  markets.  Of these, QQ is the earliest, as it started in  1999. All the other social media applications  are the products of China’s social media boom  beginning  in  2005.  However,  the  history  of  social media in China did not start in 1999,  if  we  consider  ‘social’  as  being  connected  virtually  through  textual  and,  later,  audio- visual  interfaces.  Any  discussion  of  early  social media history in China has to examine  pre-1999  ‘social’  media,  such  as  email  and  BBS,  and  look  into  the  role  of  technology  and human agency in social innovation.  The  early  history  of  social  media  in  China  can  be  roughly  divided  into  three  eras:  predawn   1986–1993 ,  early  dawn   1994–1996 , and sunrise  1997–1999 . The  early Chinese social media developed out of  a nebulous environment in which the Party- state, the fledgling IT industry, and computer  and information technology enthusiasts  both  professional  and  amateurs   were  explor- ing the power and mystery of computer and  Internet-mediated  communication.  It  arose  out  of  a  ‘lawless’  state,  as  the  first  cam- paign  to  ‘civilize’  Chinese  cyberspace  did  not  start  until  2000. This  was  the  ‘Network  Civilization  Project’,  jointly  launched  in    60  Beijing  by  eight  key  ministries  and  gov- ernment  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  State  Administration  of  Radio,  Film,  and  Television,  Chinese  Telecom,  Chinese Mobile, and All Chinese Universities  Association, with the aim to educate Chinese  people  on  ‘civil  surfing,  civil  web  building,  and  civil  networks’   CNNIC,  2009c .  Since  then the Chinese Internet control and censor- ship  regime  has  become  more  stringent  and  sophisticated.  The predawn  1986–1993  and early dawn   1994–1996   eras  of  the  Chinese  Internet  age  had  a  very  high  barrier  to  entry  for  the  ordinary  Chinese.  Bandwidth,  cost,  lack  of  knowledge of the Web, and lack of skills in  Chinese script input systems were four major  bottlenecks that limited the use of the Internet  to a small group of people. For most people,  cost and the lack of an efficient Chinese script  input system were the biggest roadblocks.  In the early days, computer-mediated com- munication  was  realized  through  telephone  dial-ups, at an exuberant cost. Until the late  1990s,  telephone  line  leasing  from  China  Telecom was between 5,000 and 10,000 yuan  for initial installation fees only, with a long  and  complicated  application  process.  Once  the line was connected, one had to bear the  expensive  ongoing  cost,  as  the  telephone  dial-up connection to other modems and later  the  Internet  was  charged  on  a  time-metered  system. Long distance charges when dialling  up out of the local calling area was charged  at  1  yuan  or  more  per  minute.  An  average  Chinese  person,  whose  annual  income  was  only around 5,500 yuan in mid-1990s, could  not afford this. Home phone ownership was  low.  Mobile  phone  ownership  was  even  lower. Indeed, until 1999, the mobile phone  was a luxury item used only by high-income  earners,  successful  businessmen  and  high- ranking government officials.  It was not only slow and expensive to use  dial-up connections to access other modems  and  the  Internet,  but  also  technically  dif- ficult  to  type  Chinese  characters  and  cre- ate  Chinese  content  in  computer-mediated   communication  applications. As  in  the  case  of  Japan,  the  necessity  of  developing  soft- ware and transmission protocols for the input  and  display  of  a  complex  character-based  script  prompted  researchers  and  private  entrepreneurs  to  develop  Chinese  character  input systems using the standard QWERTY  keyboard,  with  some  using  pinyin   the  romanization  of  Chinese  characters ,  some  using  strokes,  or  a  combination  of  pinyin  and  strokes.  Even  though  the  Five  Strokes  Input System was developed in 1983, it was  difficult  to  learn  and  master  without  proper  training.  Computer  literacy  remained  low  in China for the next decade. The invention  of the Intelligent ABC system in 1993 made  it  possible  for  everyone  with  a  knowledge  of  standard  Chinese  to  type  Chinese  text  phonetically,  press  the  space  key  to  display  various  options  in  Chinese  characters  of  the  same  sound,  and  choose  the  right  char- acter  by  pressing  the  number  preceding  it.  Although  this  system  was  still  slow,  it  was  now possible for amateurs to read and write  Chinese  scripts  on  screen.   There  are  now  about  a  dozen  simplified  Chinese  character  input  systems  in  pinyin,  strokes,  and  their  combination respectively. The most popular  ones,  such  as  the  Sogou  pinyin,  known  as  ‘Intelligent  Pinyin’  systems,  allow  people  without any training to type quickly by using  pinyin initials of all characters in a sentence.  The earliest ‘Intelligent Pinyin’ system was  invented in 2000.  The lack of facilities, high  cost of accessing the web, and lack of skills  in  Chinese  script  input  systems  meant  that  computer-mediated communication was lim- ited  to  a  very  small  number  of  leading  sci- entists in research institutions in Beijing and  Shanghai via dedicated satellite connections.  The  Chinese  government  bore  the  expense.  The  early  use  of  computer-mediated  com- munication  was  for  research  and  academic  exchange, via emails and file transfers.  Email was the earliest ‘social media’ in the  pre-Internet era in China. It remained ‘the most- used and most important Internet service’ in  China until the early 2000s  Shi, 2015: 127 .     alternative histories oF soCial Media in JaPan and China  61  The  first  email  from  China  was  sent  by  Wu  Weimin  from  the  High  Energy  Physics  Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences to  a computer in Geneva in 1986 as an experi- ment  CNNIC, 2009a . But the first officially  recognized email from China was sent by two  scientists  from  the  Beijing-based  Institute  of  Computer  Application  to  Karisruhe  University  in  Germany  in  1987,  with  only  one line ‘Across the Great Wall we can reach  every corner in the world’  CNNIC, 2009a .  This event is often heralded as China’s first  step towards its Internet age. With the estab- lishment of computer exchange networks in  major Chinese cities and of intra-campus and  inter-campus  research  networks  in  China’s  leading  universities  and  academic  research  institutes,  email  connections  were  estab- lished in 1992 in Beijing to enable academic  exchange  with  overseas  universities  and  institutions.  This  access  was  later  extended  to  universities  in  eight  major  cities,  such   as Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi’an  CNNIC,  2009a .  Even though email is by no means ‘social  media’ by today’s standard, due to its lack of  interactivity  and  dialogic  transmission  sys- tem, it offered the first taste of ‘being social’  among Chinese scientists, academics, univer- sity students, and telecom-geeks  enthusiasts  obsessed with trying out new telecommuni- cation  technologies  as  a  hobby .  Emailing  gave early users of radio, computer and later  Internet  networks  the  buzz  of  connecting  with people from afar through texts. It offered  the early users a taste of the Internet as ‘an  attractive medium for social exchanges’  Shi,  2015: 131 , particularly after China was fully  connected to the World Wide Web in 1994.  This took place on 20 April 1994 when the  National Computing and Networking Facility  of China  NCFC  project, led by HU Qiheng,  set up the first direct TCP IP  Transmission  Control  Protocol Internet  Protocol   connec- tion  via  a  64K  international  dedicated  line  to  the  Internet  through  Sprint  Co.  Ltd  of  the United States, after years of negotiation  with  the  US  government  and  lobbying  the   international scientific community  CNNIC,  2009b . After  that,  major  networks,  includ- ing China Education and Research Network   CERnet ,  China  Science  and  Technology  Network   CSTnet ,  China  Golden  Bridge  Network   CGBnet ,  and  China  Public  Computer  Internet   ChinaNet ,  were  built  and  began  providing  services  to  nation- wide  research  institutions  and  university  campuses,  government  agencies   including  banks  and  customs ,  and  the  general  public  in 1996. Within a year, Chinese Internet users  grew  from  several  thousand  to  0.2  million   Shanghai Technology, n.d. .  The full connection to the Internet remained  an  ivory  tower  celebration  until  1996  when  the Internet was open to the public and began  to  be  marked  by  commercial  operations  via  the  newly  built  ChinaNet.  Anybody  could  connect  to  the  Internet  and  have  an  email  account upon subscribing to China Telecom’s  dial-up services via the telephone line. Email  took  off  as  the  most  talked-about  topic  and  service  in  China,  reported  as  the  most-used  application  by  more  than  90%  of  Chinese  Internet  users   CNNIC,  1999 .  Few  people  cared about the  high  cost and  slow  speed  in  dialing  up  and  sending receiving  emails.  Chinese people did not have any significant  cultural  reservation  about  online  socializ- ing  with  strangers  through  computer-medi- ated  communication.  They  embraced  social  media technologies imported from the West  with great enthusiasm, and created a Chinese  ‘online  carnival’  in  the  2000s   Herold  &  Marolt, 2011 .  The  emailing  craze  and  the  commercial  operation  of  the  Internet  in  China  offered  Internet  Service  Providers   ISPs,  both  pri- vate  and  public   the  opportunity  to  kick  off  a booming Internet business. The pioneer of  private  ISPs  is Ying  Haiwei,  established  in  1997 in Beijing. It was modelled after AOL  to offer a range of paid services and connec- tions  for  commercial  and  individual  users,  including  email  and  BBS.  Its  paid  email  service  was  very  soon  challenged  by  a  free  email service called 163.com, developed by    62  another  private  ISP  Netease  at  the  end  of  1997. Free email service eventually became  the  mainstream  business  model  and  pushed  paid  email  service  out  of  the  market  in  the  early 2000s  Shi, 2015: 129–130 .  Another early form of ‘social media’ and  precursor to the World Wide Web and others  aspects of the Internet are bulletin board sys- tems  BBSs , first computer-based using the  Unix  system  and  Mosaic  web  browser  and  then,  since  1994,  TCP IP  based.  The  com- puter-based BBSs were amateur in nature, as  they were mostly set up as a hobby by young  techno-enthusiasts  such  as  the  HAM   ama- teur  radio   community  and  CFido   Chinese  Fido  Net   participants,  who  experimented  with  radio  and  computer  software   such  as  Shareware or Freeware  for fun and network- ing, without any commercial interest or polit- ical agenda  Lin, 2009: 4 . The TCP IP-based  BBSs  are  Internet  enabled,  which  allows  same  single  connection  to  multiple  services  by multiple telephone lines and modems for  messaging  and  file  transfer.  For  many  early  users, BBSs were the Internet.  Amateur  ‘social  media’  started  in  1991,  with the first CFido BBS ‘Great Wall’ estab- lished  by  a  Taiwanese  living  in  Beijing.  CFido  BBSs  were  the  social  media  for  young techno-enthusiasts between 1993 and  1998.  As  the  earliest  form  of  BBS,  CFido  was  not  Internet-based.  CFido  BBSs  were  established  to  connect  with  other  comput- ers  via  telephone  lines  and  analog  dial-up  modems. They  were  mostly  run  as  a  hobby  by  radio  and  computer  enthusiasts  to  offer  free  point-to-point  communication  to  other  enthusiasts.  The  CFido  BBS  operators  had  to  bear  the  cost  of  telephone  line  leasing,  the ongoing cost, as well as that of the com- puter  around 15,000 yuan in the mid-1990s .   The  setup  expense  alone  was  beyond  an  average Chinese’s annual income. The long- distance dial-up fee was difficult to bear by  most  young  techno-enthusiasts.  Hence  the  early BBSs were often a local phenomenon,  such  as  Beijing’s  ‘Great  Wall’,  Shantou’s  ‘Hand in Hand’, Guangzhou’s ‘New Moon’,   and Shenzhen’s ‘PonySoft’  Lin, 2009: 4–5 .  They offered similar-minded techno-enthusiasts  a forum to communicate and exchange infor- mation  about  computing  technologies  and  software. These people often met offline for  social  gatherings,  since  they  usually  lived  in the same area. BBS operators were often  treated as ‘celebrities’ by their peers.  As  the  earliest  form  of  ‘social  media’,  CFido  could  only  allow  a  small  number  of  people  sometimes just two or three  online  at the same time. The offline meetings were  more ‘social’ than online co-presence. But it  nurtured  many  of  the  leading  figures  in  the  Chinese ICT industry and Internet business,  such as DING Lei  founder of Netease , MA  Huateng   aka  Pony  Ma,  founder  of Tencent  Inc. ,  QIU  Bojun   founder  of  Kingsoft ,  LEI  Jun   CEO  of  Kingsoft  and  founder  of  Xiaomi Inc. , and CHEN Danian  co-founder  of  Shanda  Networking .  Their  early  experi- ence with computer networks, their entrepre- neurism enabled by China’s open and reform  policies from 1979 onwards, and particularly  after 1993, and their indigenous localization  of Western ICT technologies and services all  set  the  foundation  and  direction  of  Chinese  social media development.  China’s  first  TCP IP-based  BBS  –  the  Dawn  BBS  –  was  opened  upon  China’s  full  functional  connection  with  the  World  Wide  Web  in  April  1994,  hosted  by  the  National  Research  Centre  for  Intelligent  Computing  Systems   CNNIC,  2009b .  It  was the first public and Internet-based BBS  in China, and offered services such as news  updates,  online  forums  and  chat  rooms.  Soon  afterwards,  various  university  cam- pus-based  BBSs  and  public  BBSs  were  set  up. The most ‘luxurious’ BBS was Shuimu  Tsinghua,  set  up  by  students  at  the  pres- tigious  Tsinghua  University  in  1995,  serv- ing mainly users of the CERnet, with more  than 100 discussion groups, email services,  online  chatting  services,  and  games   Zhao,  1996:  65 .  It  remained  the  most  popu- lar  campus-based  but  open-to-the-public  BBS until 2005, when Tsinghua University    alternative histories oF soCial Media in JaPan and China  63  authorities  decided  to  stop  public  access  and subscription to the BBS by enforcing a  real-name  and  student-ID  registration  sys- tem and by taking control of the BBS serv- ers under the instruction of the Ministry of  Education. Under the increasingly stringent  Internet  censorship  regime,  other  CERnet- based BBSs followed a similar path towards  their demise in the eyes of the public. These  BBSs, however, remain an important enter- tainment, information, and socialization hub  for Chinese universities’ students.  the   Other renowned public BBS in the 1990s  include: ‘SRS BBS’, established in 1996 by  the  Stone  company,  its  popularity  peaking  in  1997  when  a  user  famously  posted  to  its  ‘Sports  Salon’  section  lamenting  the  failure  and  fate  of  the  Chinese  men’s  soccer  team   Lin, 2009: 71–74 ; ‘MOP’, starting in 1997  as a BBS for console gamers and later becom- ing  top  entertainment-oriented  BBS  in  China;  ‘Xici’,  kicking  off  in  1998  as  the  first  open-platform  online  forum  in  China;  ‘Tianya  Forum’,  established  in  1999  as  a  BBS  for  stock  investors  but  quickly  evolv- ing into a popular BBS with a sociocultural  focus;  and  ‘Strong  Nation  Forum’,  a  leftist  political and social affairs BBS set up by the  Party’s flagship newspaper People’s Daily in  1999  in  response  to  the  NATO  bombing  of  the  Chinese  embassy  in  Belgrade   Damm,  2015:  187;  Peng,  2005:  70,  201 .  During  this period, all major web portals and search  engines  set  up  BBSs  as  part  their  services.  These BBS pioneers have continued to grow  and re-invent themselves in the 2000s in com- petition with QQ and many other social media  services.  Even  QQ  gradually  transformed  itself from simply an instant messaging tool  to  one  of  the  largest  instant  message-based  BBSs and SNS by the mid-2000s.  These   interactive  and  user-generated  online  forums  were  marked  by  ‘impurity’  from the very beginning, compared to CFido.  As discussed earlier, the earliest BBSs were  expensive  and  technologically  tricky  to  set  up, marked with an amateur ‘sharing’ spirit,  and  underpinned  by  a  belief  in  freedom  of   information  for  fun  and  networking.  The  BBSs in operation after 1996, however, were  set up by either government agencies or pri- vate  entrepreneurs,  all  with  clear  political  agendas and commercial interests. Emailing  services  followed  the  same  pattern,  as  they  moved from ivory towers to the market after  1996. The eventual triumph of the free email  business  model  over  paid  email  services  in  the late 1990s signalled another aspect of the  ‘impurity’  of  Chinese  social  media:  ‘free’  does not equate with ‘freedom’, but user pro- files  and  statistics,  which  can  be  traded  for  both  commercial  and  political  purposes.  Of  course, this is not unique to China but rather a  prevailing concern worldwide about big data,  surveillance,  and  privacy   see,  for  example,  van Dijck, 2014 .  QQ  occupies  a  special  place  in  China’s  techno-cultural  sphere.  It  marks  the  start  of  ‘social media for the people’, due to its low  threshold  in  technological  know-how,  sim- ple Chinese character encoding system, and  low cost. It is also the first truly ‘social’ net- working service in China. QQ also marked a  departure  from  other  early  forms  of  ‘social  media’ in China with a ‘youth and entertain- ment  focus’   Koch  et  al.,  2009:  280 ,  and  remained for a few years, at least until 2005,  the  first  major  ‘entertainment  highway’  for  young people.  Originally  called  OICQ   until  2001 ,  QQ  was  developed  by  Shenzhen-based Tencent,  one  of  China’s  biggest  Internet  companies,  in 1999. It was modelled on the then popular  ICQ,  but  also  allowed  users  to  interconnect  with  pagers  and  mobile  phones,  personal- ize  their  QQ  chat  rooms,  identify  friends  who were offline, and, most of all, to chat in  Chinese  using  a  Chinese  encoding  software  that allowed easy and quick input of Chinese  characters  Lin, 2009: 95–96 . Although QQ  was  launched  in  1999,  QQ  games  and  QQ  mobile were not launched until 2003. Tencent  launched  the  most  popular  SNS  in  China,  Qzone, in 2005, and mobile Qzone in 2007.  Upon its public launch in 1999, QQ quickly  became  popular  among  young  Chinese    64  Internet users who enjoyed using instant mes- saging to conveniently and cheaply commu- nicate with friends, despite a mixed response  to the new social media application from the  society  Koch et al., 2009 . It soon became,  and has continued to be, a must-have applica- tion in all Internet cafés in China, on home  and office computers, and on young people’s  mobile  phones.  For  many  people,  QQ  was  the  first  and  only  portal  of  the  Internet,  an  extension  of  their  social  networks,  a  practi- cal and emotional tool and space to live out  both  sociality  and  intimacy,  both  harsh  and  dream  worlds,  and  the  only  stable  identi- fier in a flux and floating life  Wallis, 2013:  100–116 .  QQ  was  particularly  favoured  by  the so-called ‘information have-less’ – a term  coined by Jack Qiu to refer to ‘low-end ICT  users,  service  providers  and  laborers  who  are  manufacturing  these  electronics’   2009:  3–4 ,  including  internal  migrants,  laid-off  workers,  retirees,  students,  unemployed  and  under-employed youth.  1999  is  a  landmark  in  the  history  of  Chinese social media. It is marked not only  by the birth of QQ, but also ChinaRen. Like  QQ, ChinaRen was also a copycat version of a  Western SNS. It was modelled on Friendster,  but  incorporated  elements  of  AOL  into  its  services. It was more than a social network- ing site, as it provided a comprehensive range  of localized content and services that targeted  college students, such as social networking,  online  forums,  music,  games,  social  life,  and  news.  It  was  a  sensation  among  young  Internet  users  around  2000,  even  though  its  popularity  quickly  declined  after  it  was  bought by Sohu.com in September 2000 and  later replaced by more specialized SNS, such  as  Douban   2005– ,  Xiaonei   2005–2009;   renamed  ‘Renren’  since  2009 ,  Qzone    2005– ,  Sina  Weibo   2009– ,  and  WeChat   2011– .  QQ  has  continued  to  improve  its  service  and  enjoyed  its  popularity  among  Chinese-speaking  communities,  while  ChinaRen is rarely talked about nowadays.  QQ  was  the  product  of  Pony  Ma  and  his  team,  who  were  early  Chinese  ICT   the  pricing  and  Chinese   enthusiasts  and  amateur  hosts  of  pre-Inter- net BBSs, while ChinaRen was established  by  America-trained  techno-entrepreneurs  Chen Yizhou   Joseph  Chen   and  his  team.  Both were launched at a time when revamp- ing  language  encoding  systems  were  urgently  needed  to  popularize  the  Internet  in  China.  Both  SNSs  played  an  important  role  in  educat- ing the Chinese about ‘e-life’, which was a  buzzword  used  by  entrepreneurs  in  the  IT  industry to describe Internet-mediated com- munication, entertainment, and commercial  activities.  Social  media  like  QQ,  ChinaRen,  and  their  precursors   email  and  BBS ,  were  all  products  of  Chinese  copycat  entrepreneur- ship  with  important  elements  of  indigenous  innovation  when  Western  products  and  ser- vices  were  introduced  and  localized  for  the  Chinese market. The PC was the main inter- face to access social media and the Internet.  The  providers  of  these  services  in  the  early  eras  of  Chinese  Internet  and  social  media  aimed to offer social exchange and entertain- ment  with  no  strings  attached.  This  indus- try  was  soon  marked  by  ‘impurity’  when  political  and  commercial  interests  became  the driving force behind the boom of social  media  applications,  particularly  on  mobile  devices since 2005. As China’s Internet cen- sorship  regime  developed  and  grew  more  sophisticated, social networking for fun and  entertainment has become a political decision  as  well  as  commercial  pursuit,  for  service  providers and users alike.  The early history of social media in China   pre-2000   demonstrates  the  role  of  grass- roots  entrepreneurship  in  technological  and  social  innovation.  It  debunks  the  normative  interpretation  of  Chinese  media  and  com- munication,  which  credits  the  Chinese  state  as  promoter,  controller,  and  censor  of  the  Internet,  and  argues  for  attention  to  local  dynamics, individual agency, and indigenous  innovation  in  domesticating  Western  tech- nologies  and  concepts.  Key  to  the  develop- ment  of  the  Internet  and  social  media  are    alternative histories oF soCial Media in JaPan and China  65  ICT  intermediaries,  particularly  those  who  are  keen  observers  of  and  innovators  in  global technological and business fields. The  entrepreneurship  of  these  intermediaries  is  grounded in their local and national cultural,  political,  and  socioeconomic  contexts  and  market  conditions.  It  is  this  localized  prag- matism and entrepreneurship that have driven  social  media  development  along  distinctive  paths in China and Japan.  conclusion  In  this  chapter,  we  have  provided  brief  but  richly-textured and critical histories of social  media  in  two  countries  which  have  loomed  largely  in  earlier  phases   Japan   and  later  phases   China   of  development.  These  con- crete  case  studies  of  the  development  of  social  media  reveal  how  cultural,  social,  media, economic, political, and market histo- ries  are  crucial  to  understanding  particular  social media histories.  What clearly emerges is the way that par- ticular  infrastructural  politics  and  policies  are  bound  up  with  information  technology,  computers,  networking,  and  media  varies  considerably – yet they all exert an enduring  influence  on  contemporary  developments.  Such dynamics thread through the particular  Internet  technologies,  cultures,  and  mean- ings  that  predominate  in  different  countries  that  prefigure  social  media.  The  influence  of messaging  the iconic QQ technology  in  China provided an early impetus for Internet  entertainment that has become central to con- temporary  social  media. Yet  QQ  is  also  an  obvious  predecessor  to  the  rise  of  messag- ing-inflected  platforms  such  as  Weibo  and  WeChat.  Mobile  phones  and  mobile  phone  culture  are  another  important  area  for  understand- ing  social  media  histories,  especially  across  many  non-Western  countries  where  social  media has emerged at roughly the same time  as  mobile  media.  Japan  is  often  celebrated   both  internationally  and  in  East  Asia  as  a  model for early mobile use. Yet we see that  in  China  the  PC  remained  the  only  inter- face for the Internet until 2000, when China  Mobile  started  its  Wireless  Application  Protocol   WAP   business,  providing  access  via the mobile phone. QQ mobile, launched  in 2003, played an important role in popular- izing WAP phones such as the Nokia 7110.  However, the PC was still the main interface  for people to access the Internet until 2009.  By  contrast,  mobile  telephony  was  a  sym- bol  of  wealth  and  power,  a  luxury  item  for   high-income  earners,  until  1999  when  such  gadgets became more affordable. The emer- gence  of  shanzhai   copycatting   mobile  phones, beginning in 2003, made it easier to  own a look-a-like model of the latest foreign  brand phone  an economic factor now behind  the  young  Chinese  craze  for  gadget  fetish- ism .  Today,  China  leads  the  world  as  the  largest smart phone and mobile Internet mar- ket, with its own highly competitive applica- tions and brands.  Another  important  area  often  overlooked  in  Internet  and  digital  histories  is  the  role  of language and script – and this very much  applies  to  social  media  histories.  Given  the  complex input and display issues associated  with  non-Roman  scripts  such  as  Chinese  and Japanese, the introduction of computer- mediated  communication  in  East  Asia  was  less  straightforward  than  in  North  America  and  Europe   Goggin  &  McLelland,  2017b .  Computer  users  in  East Asian  societies  had  first  to  become  familiar  with  Roman  script,  the  QWERTY  keyboard,  and  the  non-intu- itive  ‘conversion’  input  style  required  for  local language display before CMC could be  embraced by a broad majority.  In closing, Japan has long featured in the  annals of digital technology research and dis- course, its place only comparatively recently  taken over by China, a country now attract- ing  intense  attention  as  the  market  with  the  greatest number of social media users inter- nationally.  There  are  many  other  countries,  especially Asian countries, that have not been    66  so prominent, yet whose social media histo- ries offer instructive and rich insights. As we  have seen in both cases, there remains a kind of  weird fascination, even ‘techno-orientalism’    Morley  &  Robins,  1992;  Roh,  Huang,  &  Niu,  2015 ,  via  a  fantasy  image  of  social  media that tells us more about how we imag- ine global social media in general, especially  in Western contexts, than it actually helps us  to  understand  social  media  in  particular,  or  non-Western  Asian  countries,  let  alone  the  realities  and  materialities  of  contemporary  social media internationally.  references  Abate,  T.   1996 .

According to computer indus- try  commentator Tim  O’Reilly   2005 ,  such  platforms were part of a larger paradigm shift  called ‘Web 2.0.’ They signaled a move away  from  a  web  of  static  pages  and  towards  a  more dynamic, open and participatory media  environment   ibid.;  Kelly,  2005 .  As  many  scholars  have  pointed  out,  and  as  O’Reilly  himself notes, the rise of Web 2.0 was more  evolution  than  radical  change.  Many  of  the  features and forms we associate with Web 2.0  and social media – personalization, network- ing  features,  user-generated  content,  many- to-many  communication,  and  so  on  –  were  pioneered  on  the  web  in  the  1990s  or  with  earlier forms of networked computing such as  Bulletin Board Systems  BBSs; see Chapter 2  in  this  volume .  This  raises  the  question  of  what was actually new or different about Web  2.0 and social media platforms. How should   we  think  of  the  relationship  between  social  media  and  the  early  web,  and  what  can  we  learn from this history?  In  this  chapter  I  argue  that  Web  2.0  and  social  media  must  be  seen  as  a  particular  constellation  of  previously  existing  ideas,  values, media forms, and technologies. First,  as I will show, values like participation and  openness are often associated with Web 2.0  but  were  very  much  a  part  of  web  culture  early  on.  Second,  as  sophisticated  as  the  technological infrastructures of social media  are,  they  also  strongly  echo  the  technical  vision that accompanied the web’s invention  in 1989, and are rooted in other earlier tech- nological  developments  such  as  the  rise  of  open-source software. Third, much like their  social media counterparts later on, early web  companies  gained  both  cultural  legitimacy  and  speculative  financial  investment  from  their  portrayal  as  ‘exceptional’  media  that  would  reshape  the  media  landscape  while  enhancing  individual  freedom  and  bottom- up organization.   70  In  addition  to  showing  us  where  social  media  come  from,  web  history  reminds  us  that these media were not inevitable. A wide- spread belief is that technology develops in a  linear  fashion,  and  nowhere  is  that  assump- tion  more  pronounced  than  in  popular  web  discourses.  O’Reilly  and  others  argue,  for  example,  that  Web  2.0  represents  a  natural  progression  driven  by  the  medium’s  innate  qualities.  What  these  narratives  about  the  ‘nature’  of  the  web  hide  is  that  a  range  of  actors – web users, producers and investors,  to name a few – are constantly making deci- sions about which technologies or media to  promote  and  use,  how  to  use  them,  which  ones to invest in, and so on. Such choices are  not simply the product of individuals making  rational decisions; rather, they are shaped by  culturally  specific  values,  beliefs  and  prac- tices,  political  and  commercial  interests,  as  well  as  the  material  constraints  of  available  technology. So instead of our interaction with  the medium being driven by some technolog- ical force such as the web’s true nature, it is  the opposite: these decisions and the cultural,  political and economic values they stem from  have real impacts on how the web develops  through time.  While  we  must  be  skeptical  of  concepts  like  Web  2.0  and  the  various  past  and  pre- sent ‘visions’ of the web’s purpose or nature,  we should also not dismiss them. It is exactly  because  the  web  is  shaped  socially  that  such popular narratives must be understood  critically.  They  set  expectations,  galvanize  communities  of  producers  and  users,  cre- ate  inequalities  of  attention,  steer  financial  speculation,  etc.  As  I  will  argue,  visions  of  the  web’s  purpose  are  very  much  a  part   of  the  cultural,  technological  and  economic  history of the web, and a crucial element in  the rise of social media and Web 2.0 in the  mid-2000s.  This  chapter  is  organized  in  an  overlap- ping chronology, from the web’s inception in  1989 to the hype surrounding Web 2.0 in the  mid-2000s, with each section revealing some  of the ideological and technological roots of   social  media.  Section  1  details  two  utopian  visions of digital culture – as an ‘information  universe’  and  a  ‘virtual  community’  –  that  arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and  that  continue  to  resonate  today.  In  the  sec- ond section, I turn to the dot.com bubble and  the discursive construction of the web as an  ‘exceptional’ medium seemingly destined to  replace  existing  mass  media.  At  the  center  of this discourse was Wired, the tech culture  magazine  that  laid  out  the  basic  framework  by  which  the  web  and  subsequent  tech- nologies   not  least  social  media   have  been  legitimated as disruptive departures from the  traditional media landscape. Section 3 spans  the mid- to late-1990s, when various groups  of  publishers,  designers  and  amateur  blog- gers  sought  to  define  particular  new  media  forms  and  practices  as  ‘native’  to  the  web.  Such  efforts  served  to  establish  norms  and  conventions,  distinguishing  and  legitimiz- ing  certain  practices  and  forms  in  the  eyes  of peers, audiences, customers and investors.  While much of what was called ‘web-native’  culture  in  the  late  1990s,  such  as  blogging,  is  echoed  in  social  media  platforms,  there  are important differences that highlight how  perceptions  of  the  web’s  essential  character  continue  to  change.  Section  4  discusses  the  rise  of  open  source  software,  an  important  technological precursor to social media, and  Slashdot, the innovative tech news and com- munity  website  that  prefigured  many  of  the  features  we  associate  with  ‘participatory’  social media platforms. The concluding sec- tion focuses on Web 2.0, discussing how this  supposed  paradigm  shift  brought  together  many  of  the  preceding  ideas  and  develop- ments. In short, the chapter argues against a  commonly held perception that Web 2.0 and  social  media  represent  radical   yet  inevita- ble  departures from old media and the early  web. Rather, web history shows us that both  the web and how we perceive it continually  evolves, and that to understand the medium  in its past or present form requires attention  to  the  cultural,  economic  and  technological  factors that shape it.   FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  71  1. early visions of digiTal  culTure  Rheingold’s  notion  of  ‘virtual  community’  were  revitalized  in  the  2000s  in  connection  with Web 2.0 platforms and social media.  Before the World Wide Web was a household  name  or  had  even  been  released  publicly,  ambitious ideas of what could be done with  networked  media  were  already  in  place.  In  particular,  excitement  around  the  web’s  potential derived from two key ideas, that of  an  ‘information  universe’  and  of  a  ‘virtual  community.’ On the one hand, Berners-Lee’s  notion  of  a  highly  organized  and  automated  ‘information  universe’  gave  direction  to  the  creation of web standards and protocols, and  similarities  can  be  seen  in  a  range  of  later  technical  projects,  including  Berners-Lee’s  own  work  in  connection  with  the  ‘semantic  web’   Berners-Lee,  Hendler,  and  Lassila,  2001   and,  in  a  commercial  context,  Facebook’s ‘open graph.’ On the other hand,  the  once-popular  sense  that  the  web  was  a  ‘virtual’ space separate from the offline world  has  largely  been  forgotten,  but  many  of  the  ideas,  practices  and  values  associated  with   Berners-Lee’s Information  Universe  The  World  Wide  Web  was  ‘born’  in  late  1990, with the first website up and running in  December  of  that  year   Berners-Lee,  2000;  see  Figure  4.1 .  Invented  by  Tim  Berners- Lee,  the  web  consisted  of  a  few  core  tech- nologies  that  made  it  easy  to  navigate  documents  stored  on  networked  computers.  First  was  a  standard  for  locating  specific  documents  within  existing  domains,  or  the  Uniform  Resource  Locator   URL .  Second  was the HyperText Transfer Protocol  HTTP ,  which  is  a  set  of  conventions  that  standard- izes  how  one  computer   the  client   requests  and  downloads  a  document  from  another  computer   the  server .  This  protocol  is  also  what makes it possible for documents to be   figure 4.1   info.cern.ch, the first WWW page   72  connected to one another via hyperlinks, and  why a website’s address always begins with  HTTP.  Third,  Berners-Lee  created  HTML   HyperText  Markup  Language   as  a  way  to  write web-specific documents that contained  hyperlinks.  HTML  is  a  markup  language,  meaning it describes how a document should  look  by  giving  specific  instructions  to  the  computer retrieving a document. To this day,  these  relatively  simple  protocols  and  stand- ards are still at the root of much of our online  activity, not least social media.  In some ways, the web is simply an appli- cation that sits on top of the internet, along- side other applications like email or Internet  Relay  Chat   and  largely  forgotten  ones  like  Gopher and Usenet . However, it is one that  from the beginning was tied to an ambitious  vision  of  transforming  how  knowledge  is  produced  and  managed.  Berners-Lee  pro- posed  and  built  the  web  at  the  European  Organization  for  Nuclear  Research   called  CERN , and the technology’s stated purpose  was  to  share  information  resources  among  scientists at the lab  Berners-Lee, 1989 . But  in  thinking  about  its  potential,  Berners-Lee  went  much  further  than  the  physics  labora- tory.  In  an  introductory  technical  paper  he  wrote  with  Robert  Calliau  and  other  col- leagues,  Berners-Lee  described  the  larger  ‘dream’  driving  the  project,  dubbed  ‘the  information universe’:  Pick  up  your  pen,  mouse,  or  favorite  pointing  device and press it on a reference in this document –   perhaps to the author’s name, or organization, or  some related work. Suppose you are then directly  presented  with  the  background  material  –  other  papers,  the  author’s  coordinates,  the  organiza- tion’s  address,  and  its  entire  telephone  directory.  Suppose  each  of  these  documents  has  the  same  property  of  being  linked  to  other  original  docu- ments all over the world. You would have at your  fingertips  all  you  need  to  know  about  electronic  publishing, high-energy physics, or for that matter,  Asian culture.  Berners-Lee et al., 1991: 461   The dream was a universal document system  and information resource. It was imagined as  a kind of ultimate reference medium, linking   together  every  other  informational  medium  from telephone books and library catalogs to  encyclopedias  and  scientific  databases.  It  was  a  scientist’s  dream,  and  in  fact  con- sciously echoed the dreams of previous sci- entists. The web, the authors suggested, was  set  to  fulfill  the  vision  set  out  in  1945  by  Vannevar Bush, who had suggested a hyper- text-like system could enable more collabo- ration  in  the  scientific  community   Bush,  1945 . It also resembled Xanadu, a hypertext  system devised by Ted Nelson as part of his  general  advocacy  of  using  computers  for  individual  empowerment   Nelson,  1974 .  But  where  previous  hypertext  projects  remained  speculative  fictions  or  stalled  during development, the web would succeed.  Berners-Lee began to publicize the project in  1991, and in 1993 CERN released the source  code  for  the  World  Wide  Web  server  and  browser to the public domain, meaning these  could be used and adapted on a royalty-free  basis.  Beginning  with  the  release  of  the  Mosaic  browser   which  allowed  for  in-line  multimedia,  and  thus  a  richer  user  experi- ence   in  mid-1993,  the  growth  of  the  web  was meteoric.  What  Berners-Lee  created  was  not  just  a  clever solution to the problem of sharing doc- uments remotely, but a system that was uto- pian  in  its  scope  and  ambition.  Even  today,  a similar dream of an accessible and univer- sal information system guides Berners-Lee’s  work  at  the  World  Wide  Web  Consortium   the W3C , the body that develops standards  and protocols for the web. But this ‘dream’  of a perfectly organized information universe  is  not  limited  to  the  work  of  non-profits;  it  is clearly echoed in the products created by  prominent  Web  2.0  and  social  media  com- panies.  For  example,  Google’s   n.d.   stated  ‘mission’ is ‘to organize the world’s informa- tion  and  make  it  universally  accessible  and  useful,’  while  Facebook’s  efforts  to  create  a  ‘social  graph’  involves  not  only  a  univer- sal  mapping  of  social  relationships  but  also  of  the  connections  between  people  and  a  range of places, events, interests, and so on.    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  73  The  technology  of  the  web  and  the  utopian  vision  surrounding  it  was  clearly  grounded  in the needs and ideas of scientists, and per- haps this is why Berners-Lee did not imme- diately see the web’s potential in the realm of  entertainment media or as the basis for social  media. Nonetheless, social media should be  understood in part as an extension of this ini- tial work, both in the sense of Berners-Lee’s  technical inventions and his larger ambitions  for the web.  The Virtual Community   and the WELL  While  Berners-Lee  was  working  at  CERN  and  imagining  the  web  as  an  ‘information  universe,’ another vision of the future of net- worked  computing  was  emerging  on  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  Distinct  from  the  scientist’s  dream  of  a  comprehen- sive  knowledge  resource  and  working  envi- ronment,  this  was  a  vision  of  community,  collaboration  and  creative  expression.  Similar  values  would  eventually  be  tied  to  Web  2.0  and  social  media.  However,  in  the  early-  and  mid-1990s  this  technological  vision  was  associated  with  an  influential  BBS called the Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link   the WELL .  The WELL  largely  served  users  living  in  the San Francisco Bay Area, including many  of the people working in the computer indus- try  and  research  centers  of  Silicon  Valley.  Much  like  the  Whole  Earth  Catalog  that  inspired  it,  the  WELL  brought  together  a  somewhat  strange  mix  of  hippies  and  tech- nology  enthusiasts,  as  well  as  a  dedicated  community of fans of psychedelic rock. Like  other BBSs at the time, the WELL consisted  of various discussion forums  called ‘confer- ences’  on topics ranging from technology to  parenting. Unlike most of its contemporaries,  it  gained  notoriety  and  cultural  credibility  largely through publicity and the presence of  a few high-profile users. This group included  technology  entrepreneurs,  journalists  and   emerging  ‘gurus’  of  digital  culture  such  as  John  Perry  Barlow  and  Mitch  Kapor,  the  founders  of  the  digital  rights  organization  The  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation.  Most  of all, the WELL’s status as a key object in  the history of online culture derives from the  work of Howard Rheingold, another influen- tial WELL user who wrote about the BBS in  his book The Virtual Community  2000; orig- inally published in 1993 .  Rheingold is a noted journalist and thinker  in  the  Bay  Area’s  technology  scene,  and  someone who epitomizes the Californian ‘free  thinker’ persona with brightly-colored shirts  and painted shoes to go along with his mostly  optimistic views on technology. Introducing  the  book,  subtitled  ‘Homesteading  on  the  Electronic Frontier,’ Rheingold wrote:  conduct   People in virtual communities use words on screens  to  exchange  pleasantries  and  argue,  engage  in  intellectual  discourse,  commerce,  exchange  knowledge,  share  emotional  support,  make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love,  find friends and lose them, play games, flirt, create  a  little  high  art  and  a  lot  of  idle  talk.  People  in  virtual  communities  do  just  about  everything  people  do  in  real  life,  but  we  leave  our  bodies  behind.  2000: xvii   Rheingold’s argument was not only that one  could  find  real  community  online,  but  that  virtual communities could provide a solution  to  increasing  individualization  and  atomiza- tion of society, a trend famously described by  the  sociologist  Robert  Putnam   2001   as  ‘bowling alone’  i.e., the decline of activities  that  maintain  community  such  as  bowling  leagues . On the WELL, he argued, one lived  in  a  gift  economy,  where  one  would  ‘do  things for one another out of a spirit of build- ing  something  between  them,  rather  than   a  spreadsheet-calculated  quid  pro  quo’   Rheingold,  2000:  49 .  And  while  he  also  saw  potential  dangers  such  as  increased   surveillance,  Rheingold  hoped  the  virtual   community  could  ‘revitalize  democracy’   ibid.: 295  by providing a participatory alter- native  to  the  mass  media,  which  he  argued  was ruined by consumerism and partisanship.    74  Many  years  later,  social  media  companies  promote  similar  notions  of  giving  voice  to  individuals  and  improving   inter- cultural  discussion and understanding, although with  an  important  additional  emphasis  on  users’  immediate  social  network.  For  example,  Facebook  has  variously  articulated  its  mis- sion as giving ‘people the power to make the  world more open and connected’ and work- ing  to  ‘bring  the  world  closer  together’   Johnson, 2017 .  It’s  important  to  note  that  although  the  WELL  often  serves  as  the  default  exam- ple of online culture in the 1980s and early  1990s,  there  were  many  other  instances  of  networked  computing  being  used  to  build  and  maintain  communities.  These  include  the  BBSs  discussed  elsewhere  in  this  volume  and  by  Driscoll   2014 ,  but  also  non-US  examples  like  the  publicly  funded  Minitel  network  in  France  as  well  as the Amsterdam, Netherlands initiative De  Digitale  Stad   DDS .  Funded  partially  by  the  city  government,  DDS  consciously  bor- rowed  Rheingold’s  concept,  adapting  the  idea somewhat to envision using ‘digital cit- ies’  as  a  way  to  enhance  local  community  and to encourage intercultural awareness via  virtual  ‘travel’  to  other  cities  and  cultures   see  Hinssen,  1995 .  Such  initiatives  are  notable not only for how they foreshadowed  social media, but also how they differ from  what came later. Not least, Minitel and DDS  remind us that, unlike broadcast media, there  are no popular publicly-funded social media,  even if this once seemed possible.  Rheingold’s  vision  of  virtual  community  was powerful and prescient, but also flawed.  In addition to what critics have called a naiveté  or  ‘starry-eyed’  utopianism  on  the  part  of  Rheingold and other early internet commen- tators   Morozov,  2011:  xiii ,  the  idea  of  the  ‘virtual’  should  be  approached  critically,  as  should  Rheingold’s  sense  that  collaboration  on  the WELL  was  a  gift  economy. While  it  seemed that the flourishing community on the  WELL was made possible by the borderless  nature of cyberspace, the truth was quite the   opposite. As Turner  2006  argues, the WELL  was so coveted by its users precisely because  of  its  geography:  the  computer  industry  in  Silicon Valley was and still is marked by rapid  employment turnover, meaning workers must  maintain a large number of social ties as they  move  from  one  job  to  another.  The WELL,  in  addition  to  ‘community’  in  the  sense  of  friendship  and  discussion,  was  an  invalu- able resource for staying in the loop  Turner,  2006;  for  a  related  discussion  of  ‘venture  labor’  during  the  dot.com  bubble,  see  Neff,  2012 .  These  connections  to  geography  and  work life make sense when we look ahead to  social media: the distinction between offline  and online networks is often hard to draw, and  social network sites are an important source  of ‘weak ties’ that act as a ‘bridging’ form of  social capital, for example, helping  former   college students to find ‘jobs, internships and  other  opportunities’   Ellison,  Steinfield,  and  Lampe, 2007: 1164 .  Despite  its  flaws,  the  concept  of  virtual  community  provided  an  important  ‘frame’  for  understanding  networked  computing  right at the moment that the web was coming  into view  Turner, 2006: 159 , and its utopian  undertones continue to resonate today. It was  a powerful notion both for former hippies like  Rheingold, who hoped to recover a lost sense  of  community  and  public  discourse  online,  as  well  as  for  corporations,  which  thought  the  sponsorship  of  online  ‘communities’  was  a  promising  form  of  commercializing  the  new  medium   ibid.:  161 . And  although  the  concept’s  popularity  soon  declined,  the  underlying  sense  of  the  web  as  a  medium  of  collaboration  and  community  resurfaced  in  the  early  2000s  and  played  a  major  role  in  how  social  media  were  perceived  and  understood.  In  fact,  it  was  another  book  by  Rheingold that set the tone. In 2002 he wrote  Smart Mobs, in which he surveyed the chang- ing media landscape – in particular the rise of  mobile computing and the use of reputation  systems to engender trust in online communi- ties – and argued that the emerging technolo- gies had ‘one thing in common: They enable    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  75  people to act together in new ways and in sit- uations where collective action was not pos- sible before’  Rheingold, 2002: xviii, italics  in original . With smart mobs, as with virtual  communities, unprecedented voluntary coop- eration was seen as the revolutionary product  of technological change. Although the sense  of the web as a virtual space was quickly fad- ing, the spirit of Rheingold’s notion of virtual  community was once again very much alive.  2. The poliTics of doT.com  euphoria: Web excepTionalism  and cyberliberTarianism  Although  Berners-Lee  and  Rheingold  had  ambitious visions for the future of networked  computing,  neither  likely  could  have  pre- dicted  the  massive  amounts  of  hype  and  financial  speculation  that  soon  followed.  Soaring stock prices were fueled by a belief  that  the  web  was  fated  to  replace  existing  media.  In  line  with  this  belief  that  the  web  was  an  ‘exceptional’  medium   Stevenson,  2014b   set  to  displace  existing  media,  an  important component of 1990s digital culture  was the discursive construction of the web as  a  medium  of  individual  and  economic   ‘freedom’   Chun,  2006 .  This  emphasis  on  freedom was part of a political outlook that  critics  called  ‘cyberlibertarianism,’  which  combines libertarianism – a political philoso- phy that prioritizes individual freedoms over  collective duties and is generally opposed to  centralized state power – with technological  utopianism  and  countercultural  values   Barbrook  and  Cameron,  1996;  Borsook,  2000; Winner,  1995;  for  an  overview  and  a  wider  perspective  on  the  ‘non-politics’  of  digital  culture,  see  Liu,  2004:  239–282 .  Understanding  the  interrelated  history  of  web  exceptionalism,  dot.com  hype  and  cyberlibertarianism  is  important  for,  among  other  things,  understanding  how  today’s  social  media  companies  portray  themselves  and how they operate in the political realm.   For example, Facebook’s recent Internet.org  initiative raises important questions about the  belief in the emancipatory power of technol- ogy,  ongoing  attempts  to  ‘lock  in’  large  populations  to  a  single  platform,  as  well  as  how the libertarian politics of Silicon Valley  companies  become  implicated  in  social  and  political domains such as international devel- opment  see, for example, Morozov, 2013 .  The  dot.com  bubble  was  ushered  in  on  August  9,  1995,  when  the  web  software  company Netscape Communications held its  Initial Public Offering  IPO  and doubled its  share  price  in  a  single  day.  The  excitement  and financial speculation was unprecedented,  as  there  was  little  evidence  that  the  compa- ny’s business model – based on the popular- ity  of  its  Netscape  Navigator  web  browser   previously  called  ‘Mosaic’   and  potential  sales of its ‘Enterprise’ web server software –   would  ever  work.  What  it  did  have  was  a  near  monopoly  in  terms  of  browser  market  share that allowed Netscape to present itself  as the web’s primary ‘platform,’ but this was  at  a  time  when  just  3%  of  Americans  had  ever logged onto the World Wide Web  Pew  Research  Center,  1995 ,  and  thus  does  not  fully  explain  the  company’s  rapid  financial  success. Rather, as Streeter  2010  argues, the  excitement  around  Netscape  relied  not  only  on its demonstrated dominance on the web,  but the ‘romantic’ sense that the web was a  ‘rebellious’  force  set  to  reshape  the  media  landscape.  This perception of the web’s inevitable tri- umph was widespread due to its promotion in  national  newspapers,  magazines  and  broad- cast  news,  especially  after  Netscape’s  IPO.  However, it was clearly a perception that was  born  within  and  around  the  computing  and  multimedia  industry. As  the  web  came  into  view,  the  most  prominent  voice  expressing  this idea was Wired, the tech culture magazine  created by Louis Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe,  which  claimed  to  report  on  and  represent   ‘the  most  powerful  people  on  the  planet   today  –  the  DIGITAL  GENERATION’   Rosetto,  1993 .  Wired  was  an  upstart    76  independent  publication,  and  the  founders  wanted it to be a forum for the tech world’s  most  disruptive  thinkers  and  entrepre- neurs, much like Rolling Stone had been for   the  music  world  before   Wolf,  2003 .  Wired  was  not  the  first  magazine  to  focus  on  the  cultural  and  political  aspects  of  computing  technology  there were predecessors such as  Mondo 2000; see Boulware, 1995 . However,  its  mix  of  high  production  values,  a  distinc- tive  visual  and  editorial  style  as  well  as  its  connections  to  a  network  of  influential  tech  journalists  and  entrepreneurs  –  in  large  part  those who populated the WELL – helped the  magazine become a key player in the emerg- ing industry  Turner, 2006; Wolf, 2003 . The  magazine sought to be an arbiter of taste for  the new media and offer what it saw as rare  insight  into  the  radical  changes  wrought  by  new  technology.  In  one  of  its  more  famous  moves,  Wired  portrayed  Marc  Andreessen   the  young  co-founder  of  Netscape   as  a  young  David  taking  on  Microsoft’s  Goliath,  and  helped  fan  the  flames  of  hype  on  the  way  to  Netscape’s  historic  IPO  a  year  later   Streeter, 2010 . While the magazine arguably  no longer has the same cult status it did in the  1990s, it remains an important ‘cultural inter- mediary’ in digital culture that can help make  or break new startups. More generally, Wired’s  legacy can be seen in how subsequent actors  in new media culture have similarly appealed  to  the  web’s  ‘nature’  and  a  rhetoric  of  free- dom in an effort to legitimize particular new  technologies  and  media  forms   Stevenson,  2016 . Again, Facebook serves as an impor- tant example: in various interviews and other  publicity,  Mark  Zuckerberg  has  often  stated  that the company’s mission is to promote con- nectivity,  openness  and  transparency,  values  that  he  understands  as  part  of  a  larger  and  inevitable cultural shift inherent to the rise of  the  internet   see,  for  example,  Zuckerberg’s  interview  in  Wired:  Vogelstein,  2009 .  Such  instances  demonstrate  the  continued  preva- lence of web exceptionalism, and highlight its  importance to how new media companies and  technologies are promoted and legitimized.  Because  of  its  high  visibility,  Wired  was  the focal point of some of the first critiques  of the technological and political worldview  it represented. Most famously, Wired and the  rest of the ‘virtual class’ came under attack  from  the  Marxist  cultural  critics  Richard  Barbrook  and  Andy  Cameron  in  a  piece  called ‘The Californian Ideology’  1996 . In  this  classic  touchstone  of  new  media  criti- cism, Barbrook and Cameron argue that the  ‘faith’  represented  by  Wired  is  both  contra- dictory and flawed:  [T]he Californian Ideology promiscuously combines  the  free-wheeling  spirit  of  the  hippies  and  the  entrepreneurial  zeal  of  the  yuppies.  This  amalga- mation of opposites has been achieved through a  profound  faith  in  the  emancipatory  potential  of  the  new  information  technologies.  In  the  digital  utopia,  everybody  will  be  both  hip  and  rich.   Barbrook and Cameron, 1996: 1   Wired, in line with other proponents of cyber- libertarianism   e.g.,  Dyson  et  al.,  1994 ,  essentially  argued  that  technology  and  the  free market would bring about positive social  change.  Cyberlibertarian  thinkers  suggested  that  utopia  was  possible  in  cyberspace,  but  were  remarkably  silent  on  traditional  social  issues like worker’s rights and social justice   Liu,  2004:  264–265 .  What  Barbrook  and  Cameron  were  most  critical  of  was  the  fact  that  Wired  and  its  allies  had  successfully  crafted the perception that the only way for- ward was to let technology and the market do  their  work,  and  that  any  intervention  on  the  part of government would amount to ‘holding  back’ the digital revolution. The Californian  Ideology  automatically  excluded  public  ini- tiatives,  and  the  authors  put  the  French  Minitel model forward as evidence that such  alternatives  were  possible.  In  this  way,  Barbrook  and  Cameron  argued  that  Wired’s  digital  utopianism  simply  served  as  a  ‘false  consciousness’  that  aided  the  economic   interests  of  Silicon  Valley  companies  like  Netscape.  Today,  the  most  vocal  criticism  of  cyber- libertarianism comes in the form of Evgeny  Morozov’s  polemics  against  technological    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  77  ‘solutionism,’  or  the  false  belief  among  Silicon Valley types – not least social media  companies  –  that  technical  fixes  can  and  should be developed for social and political  problems. In 1990s web culture, such techno- libertarian  problem-solving  was  on  display,  for example, in the use of ‘ignore’ functions  to  combat  verbal  abuse  in  chat  rooms  and  forums,  much  like  block  lists  and  similar  features on various social media today. A cri- tique  is  that  such  solutionism  puts  the  onus  on  victims  of  abuse,  and  that  they  do  noth- ing  to  resolve  conflict,  that  is,  they  do  not  form  a  social  solution  to  a  social  problem.  For  Morozov,  the  problem  of  solutionism  goes well beyond web communities, as more  domains of social life become dependent on  social media and related technology.  By the mid-1990s, then, important roots of  social media were in place. On the one hand,  there  were  two  separate,  influential  visions  of the web’s significance – the ‘information  universe’  and  ‘virtual  community’  –  that  helped guide the medium’s development. On  the other hand, there were the twin beliefs in  the web’s exceptional nature and in its capac- ity to bring about positive social change, both  of which became entangled with the financial  speculation  of  the  dot.com  bubble.  Today,  social  media  companies  and  initiatives  are  similarly portrayed in terms of how they form  an  exception  to  mass  media  and  an  integral  part  of  the  unfolding  media  landscape,  and  they  depend  on  these  perceptions  for  both  cultural legitimacy and financial investment.  3. defining ‘Web-naTive’ culTure  Although an increasing number of tech jour- nalists, entrepreneurs and investors were con- vinced the web would revolutionize the media  industry  and  that  new  media  companies  would  challenge  their  established  print  and  broadcast counterparts, no one was quite sure  what the web would look like. While today it  seems obvious to say that the web is a ‘social’   medium  and  that  media  companies  should  adapt,  in  the  mid-1990s  this  was  not  neces- sarily a given. Then, many existing print and  broadcast  companies  and  institutions  won- dered how to reproduce their products online,  while influential tech ‘gurus’ argued that the  only  successful  strategy  would  be  to  take  advantage  of  the  medium’s  affordances  for  interactivity.  But  even  among  those  who  thought  the  web  required  a  new  approach,  there were important disagreements of what  exactly that was. As early as 1994, one could  begin to see what amounted to competitions  or  struggles  to  define  ‘quality’  online,  and  these  activities  clearly  expressed  different  ideas about the web’s character, especially in  relation to mass and mainstream media. What  is  important  is  that  while  each  of  these  approaches  to  ‘web-native’  culture  reveal  similarities  with  today’s  social  media,  they  also offer visions of how else the web might  be approached, designed and used. They thus  give insight not only into where social media  come from, but also how social media and the  web might otherwise look.  The HotWired Debate  One important debate about the web’s iden- tity occurred when Wired, the magazine that  had hyped the web and argued it would revo- lutionize the media landscape, decided that it  would  invest  heavily  in  its  web  presence.  Beginning  in  early  1994,  publisher  and   editor-in-chief  Louis  Rossetto  made  the   decision to build the web’s first commercial  site, and the first web-only professional pub- lication   Stevenson,  2014a;  Wolf,  2003 .   To  develop  a  business  plan,  he  called  on  Jonathan  Steuer,  a  young  Stanford  graduate  student  with  the  necessary  technical  exper- tise, and a former investment banker named  Andrew Anker. In addition to several editors  from Wired’s fast-growing network and engi- neers brought in by Steuer, the new site was  to  be  headed  by  Howard  Rheingold,  who  brought with him the credibility gained from    78  his  publications  and  his  presence  on  the  WELL.  In  an  interview  with  the  New York  Times,  Rossetto  proclaimed  that  the  site  would point the way to the future: it would  ‘not be a magazine with buttons’ and instead  would  break  new  ground  in  terms  of   ‘context,  community  and  interactivity’   Markoff, 1994 .  Although begun with great enthusiasm, the  site’s  development  quickly  stalled  around  a  series  of  major  disagreements  that  divided  the  team  into  two  camps.  On  the  one  hand,  Rheingold and Steuer wanted to build a site  that  put  readers’  voices  and  digital  artwork  alongside the online magazine’s output, and  in some sense orchestrate a ‘worldwide jam  session’ of virtual community and participa- tion   Wolf,  2003:  108 .  On  the  other  hand,  community  was  important  to  Rossetto  only  to  the  extent  that  it  made  the  audience  feel  a bond with the Wired brand: for instance, a  community  feature  Rossetto  later  supported  was  a  Wired  ‘café’  where  audiences  could  chat with digital culture celebrities who were  covered  by  the  magazine.  Such  community  features,  in  Rossetto’s  mind,  should  never  overshadow  the  professional  content  being  produced.  The  debates  hardly  ended  there,  and  questions  surrounding  the  site’s  inter- face,  business  model  and  editorial  direction  all  became  battlefields  for  the  two  camps   Wolf, 2003: 93–114 . Similar debates about  the relative value of editorial versus amateur  content would continue to animate web cul- ture,  not  least  when Web  2.0  platforms  and  social  media  began  to  give  user-generated  content  a  privileged  place  in  the  mid-2000s   e.g., Keen, 2007 .  In  line  with  the  larger  sense  that  the  web  was  an  inherently  different  medium  than  existing  mass  media,  Rheingold’s  and  Rossetto’s  ideas  were  grounded  in  their  individual  perceptions  of  the  web’s  char- acter  and  significance   Stevenson,  2014b .  For Rheingold, the web was an extension of  the communities he had observed on BBSs,  and any successful website would reflect the  web’s open nature. For Rossetto, the web was   an  equalizer,  giving  independent  publica- tions like Wired the chance to compete with  large media corporations, and a space where  Wired’s  superior  knowledge  of  a  new  breed  of active consumers  in other words, the mag- azine’s tech-savvy audience  would allow the  magazine to become a dominant player in the  emerging media landscape. Where Rheingold  saw the web as ‘social’ in the sense of egali- tarian community and individual expression,  Rossetto believed the social and participatory  affordances  of  the  medium  were  important  only  as  a  means  for  professional  publica- tions  to  better  connect  with  their  audiences  and  once the technology had advanced suffi- ciently  sell targeted advertising. Their com- peting  ideas  can  be  compared  to  different  understandings of social media today: on the  one hand, social media are portrayed as pro- ductive of bottom-up community and organic  social networks  Shirky, 2008 , while on the  other hand, they can be  and increasingly are   understood  as  tools  that  increase  the  media  power  of  celebrities  and  other  ‘traditional’  media  actors  and  institutions   Marwick  and  boyd, 2011 .  The  HotWired  debate  was  never  an  even  competition,  as  Rossetto  was  firmly  in  charge; Rheingold and Steuer were  respec- tively  forced out and demoted before the site  finally  launched  in  October  1994   Keegan,  1995 .  Rossetto’s  vision  was  implemented,  although some of his decisions  such as forc- ing  readers  to  register  in  order  to  view  the  site   would  backfire  and  be  reversed.  The  site recorded a few important firsts, such as  the first banner advertisement, but was ulti- mately crushed under the weight of high pro- duction  costs.  Even  after  the  initial  debate,  HotWired was the site of a number of impor- tant  discussions  and  developments  in  web  culture and web design. For example, it was  the  birthplace  of  Suck.com,  an  influential  website  that  published  daily  essays  satiriz- ing and parodying the emerging web culture   Sharkey,  2005 .  And  in  1997,  HotWired  implemented a social network-like feature in  which HotWired ‘participants’ could create a    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  79  profile  page  and  list  their  favorite  websites.  Although  largely  remembered  for  its  failed  ambitions,  HotWired’s  history  reminds  us  that  the  ‘participatory’  logic  we  ascribe  to  Web  2.0  and  social  media  has  long  been  a  part of how the web has been imagined, and  that not all perceptions of the web as ‘social’  are necessarily the same  Stevenson, 2014a .  Designing a ‘Professional’   Web in the dot.com Bubble  Alongside  the  relatively  high-profile  debate  between Rossetto and Rheingold, the issue of  the  web’s  social  and  participatory  character  was  also  entangled  in  the  dynamics  of  a  growing  industry.  Web  production  compa- nies began to appear as early as 1994  when,  for example, a web production and marketing  company  called  Organic  Online  was  con- tracted to create advertisements and websites  for  HotWired’s  sponsors ,  and  these  would  serve  a  range  of  companies  and  institutions  for  years  to  come.  As  Megan  Ankerson   2010  has argued, the web’s dominant aes- thetics  through  the  years  can  be  mapped  against changing industry dynamics: in addi- tion  to  the  rapid  increase   and  subsequent  decrease   of  economic  capital  during  the  bubble,  the  rise  of  web  production  compa- nies,  their  alignments  and  competition  with  traditional  advertising  agencies,  as  well  as  changes in bandwidth technology and inter- net  penetration  could  all  be  seen  to  impact  web design practices. Perhaps most notably,  as  competition  the  ‘euphoric’  stage  of  the  bubble,  producers  sought to differentiate themselves by becom- ing  experts  in  animated  Flash  websites   ibid. . Flash sites were generally intended to  be large-scale, immersive and visual experi- ences,  and  demanded  heavy  budgets  and   rare  skill  sets.  By  promoting  Flash  sites  as  more  cutting-edge  and  ‘professional’  than  simple HTML, producers and designers were  able to take advantage of their clients’ desire  to  stand  out.  At  the  same  time,  these  sites   increased  during   served  to  create  a  clear  boundary  between  producers creators and users viewers. It was  only  after  the  dot.com  crash  that  usability  became a central focus for the industry, set- ting the stage for the forms of ‘permanently  beta’ web production that characterized Web  2.0  Neff and Stark, 2003 .  Ankerson’s  case  study  on  Flash  reminds  us that there is nothing natural about domi- nant  perceptions  of  web  culture  or  about  what  counts  as  quality  design  practices  at  any given time. Rather, such perceptions and  standards of quality are defined through cul- tural processes and often shaped according to  the  economic,  ideological  and  professional  interests  of  those  involved.  Another  impor- tant  case  discussed  by  Ankerson   2015   is  the  controversy  surrounding  two  projects  designed to capture and publish a single day  in the emerging history of the web. The first  of these was A Day in the Life of Cyberspace,  instigated  by  MIT  professors  to  celebrate  their Media Lab’s tenth anniversary. The pro- ject  would  showcase  life  online,  with  ‘bits’  added  from  online  citizens  from  around  the  globe.  Not  everyone  on  the  project  wanted  to publish users’ unedited contributions, and  professional  photographer  Rick  Smolan  left  A Day in the Life to work on his own project,  called 24 Hours in Cyberspace. In contrast to  MIT’s participatory platform, Smolan’s pro- ject  imagined  a  highly  professional,  global  media production, translating the high stand- ards and production values of existing media  industries into a polished, interactive product  online.  Similar  to  the  debate  at  HotWired,  there  was  a  sharp  contrast  in  how  partici- pants  valued  editorial  expertise  and  control   Ankerson, 2015 . In an ironic development  that demonstrates the complexity of the his- tory of the web and social media, the software  developed  for  Smolan’s  ‘read-only’  project  was  later  commercialized  and  marketed  to  non-professionals,  thus  becoming  a  support  for the ‘read write’ web as celebrated in the  context of Web 2.0 and social media  ibid. .  As Ankerson argues, while it is tempting to  oppose the early, static and professional Web    80  1.0  to  today’s  social  and  participatory  Web  2.0, these oppositions do not hold up so well  upon closer historical inspection.  The Rise of Blogging: Personal  Publishing, Content Management  and Web Filtering  In  many  ways  today’s  social  media  can  be  seen to extend blogging, the web genre that  rose to prominence in the late 1990s. Distinct  from  online  diaries,  which  were  relatively  common on the web as well  see, for exam- ple,  the  online  diary  history  project:  http:   diaryhistoryproject.org  ,  weblogs  mixed  individual expression with linking and other  practices  related  to  establishing  and  main- taining  ties  within  a  blogging  ‘community.’  This self-awareness and feeling of belonging  formed what bloggers argued was the genre’s  authenticity,  and  what  they  believed  was  a  contrast to the extravagance of dot.com web- sites and the impersonal voice of mass media   see, for example, Rodzvilla, 2002 . Although  opinions  differ  as  to  who  the  first  blogger  was,  the  label  is  usually  granted  to  one  of  three  people:  Justin  Hall,  Dave  Winer  and  Jorn  Barger.  What’s  more  important  than  ‘firsts,’ though, is how their individual stories  illustrate  the  genre’s  key  elements  and  the  different  ways  in  which  blogging  can  be  thought of in relation to social media.  For Justin Hall, the web was first and fore- most  a  vehicle  for  self-expression.  Having  grown up frequenting BBSs and inspired by  Wired’s talk of digital revolution, Hall started  his  website  links.net  from  his  college  dorm  room in 1994  Rosenberg, 2009 . On the site,  Hall shared links to content on the web  the  most  popular  of  which  were  links  to  adult  content   while  also  sharing  intimate  details  of  his  own  life.  Hall  went  on  to  document  events  from  his  personal  life,  from  internal  conflicts during his employment at HotWired  to the ups and downs of his personal relation- ships.  In  addition  to  Hall’s  youthful  enthu- siasm  and  status  as  one  of  the  web’s  first   ‘micro-celebrities’  Senft, 2008 , his story is  notable as a very early example of overshar- ing, a story that he himself has recently docu- mented in an excellent video autobiography   see  http:  overshare.links.net ;  for  another  classic story of blogging and oversharing, see  Gould, 2008 .  For Dave Winer, a software developer and  tech columnist, a crucial question was what  news  should  look  like  online.  The  prevail- ing organizational metaphor at the time was  spatial,  as  evidenced  by  the  term  ‘cyber- space.’  This  spatial  logic  was  apparent  in  how,  for  example,  the  personal  homepage  hosting  service  Geocities   created  in  1995   was  divided  into  ‘neighborhoods,’  and  in  the general prevalence of spatial and domes- tic  metaphors   such  as  ‘front  door,’  ‘lobby,’  and  so  on . Against  this  background, Winer  made an important contribution by adding a  feature  to  his  Frontier  publishing  suite  that  organized  new  content  in  reverse-chrono- logical order, so that the newest content was  always at the top of the page  Winer credited  the  idea  to  HotWired,  another  sign  of  that  site’s influence . This newspage addition was  an  important  technical  development  in  the  establishment of the early blogging commu- nity  Ammann, 2009 , and in general Winer’s  Frontier  content  management  system  fore- shadowed  the  various  easy-to-use  weblog  publishing  applications  that  would  become  available from 1999  starting with Pyra, the  company  that  would  later  become  Blogger  and was sold to Google .  For Jorn Barger, who built his site Robot  Wisdom  with  Winer’s  Frontier  suite  and  coined  the  term  ‘weblog’  in  late  1997,  the  web’s  virtues  were  openness  and  transpar- ency,  as  enabled  by  its  hypertextual  form.  Linking, if done right, would ideally lead to  the best content and bring light to the most  accurate  and  useful  information.  Barger  set  out to create a movement  not unlike an artis- tic or literary movement  dedicated to filter- ing the web, one that would ensure the web  provided an open alternative to the editorial  hierarchies  and  deliberate  misinformation    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  81  that characterized older media environments   Ammann,  2009 .  Although  Barger’s  influ- ence within the blogging community would  wane  amid  various  conflicts   not  least  with  Winer ,  his  efforts  and  his  ‘rules  of  art’  for  weblogs  are  significant  for  how  they  evoked  Berners-Lee’s  original  vision  of  the  web  as  a  highly  sophisticated  information  resource, and prefigured forms of collabora- tive information management such as social  bookmarking.  Although the genre would diversify at the  same  time  that  it  ‘stabilized’   Siles,  2012 ,  these  three  early  bloggers  helped  shape  the  genre’s core conventions and expectations of  it.  They  each  believed  the  form  would  take  advantage  of  the  web’s  specific  affordances  and  thereby  offer  a  distinct  alternative  to  mass  media,  although  how  much  of  an  alternative  this  was  would  later  be  called  into  question  and  critiqued   Lovink,  2008 .  Blogging  would  be  a  source  of  personal  expression,  with  collections  of  posts  and  links providing an unfiltered view of the self.  Blogs  would  be  written  with  professional- grade publishing infrastructure and presented  in a reverse-chronological format that better  suited  the  medium.  And  blogs  would  ulti- mately  be  a  collaborative  effort,  where  the  sum  was  greater  than  the  parts.  This  vision  of a collaborative effort echoed Rheingold’s  earlier  vision  of  virtual  community,  but  it  also echoed Berners-Lee’s ‘information uni- verse,’ as a key feature was that blogs would  work together to curate and annotate the best  links.  With  such  advantages  in  mind,  early  blogger  Rebecca  Blood  called  blogs  ‘native  to  the Web’   Blood,  2002 . The  term  ‘web- native’ suggests a kind of ‘pure’ web form,  one that connects a set of cultural values such  as  individual  expression  and  collaboration  with perceived characteristics of the medium.  In this way, the efforts of the early bloggers  were  similar  to  that  of  HotWired’s  creators  and the producers of 24 Hours in Cyberspace  and  A  Day  in  the  Life  of  Cyberspace:  their  accomplishment was not just about the media  product  they  created,  but  an  ability  to  tie  it   to a larger story about the web’s nature and  future direction.  4. open-source sofTWare and   The daTa Turn  While  new  genres  like  blogging  developed  and understandings of the web’s nature con- tinued to evolve, the technologies underlying  web production also changed, greatly impact- ing  the  medium’s  capacity  and  scope  and  paving  the  way  for  the  kinds  of  dynamic,  data-intensive social media platforms we use  today.  Alongside  many  advances  in  infra- structure  –  the  further  growth  of  personal  computing,  increases  in  internet  penetration  and  bandwidth,  the  rise  of  mobile  internet,  etc. – the 1990s saw the proliferation of pro- fessional grade software that was affordable  and in many cases free-to-use. In this respect  the most important development was the rise  of ‘free’ or ‘open source’ software  F OSS ,  meaning  ‘nonproprietary  but  licensed  soft- ware’  Coleman, 2012: 1 .  F OSS is generally licensed in a way that  source  code  is  made  freely  available  and  software can be adapted to a user’s particu- lar  needs.  ‘Open  source’  also  connotes  a  distributed,  partially  self-organizing  form  of  production   Benkler,  2007;  Raymond,  2005 :  beginning  with  the  operating  system  Linux, one began to see large-scale software  projects being carried out by large numbers  of  developers  across  the  world,  using  the  internet  to  coordinate  and  collaborate.  Such  open  source  production  distinguished  itself  from  traditional  software  not  only  by  the  fact that collaborators generally volunteered  their  time  and  that  they  had  a  large  say  in  the  direction  of  a  project,  but  also  through   continuous  updates   ‘rapid  prototyping’   to  the software that ran counter to the idea that  software is ever ‘finished.’ In addition to con- noting  a  particular  mode  of  production,  the  label  ‘open  source’  was  created  in  1998  to  promote the idea that freely available software    82  could  be  highly  profitable,  as  developers  could earn money from services attached to  their  non-proprietary  software   this  was  a  controversial  move  within  the  free  software  community  –  see  Kelty,  2008:  99–117 . As  the  dot.com  bubble  began  to  peak  in  1999,  ‘open  source’  companies  like  Red  Hat  held  successful IPOs and F OSS was declared the  next big thing.  The rise of F OSS impacted web culture in  the 1990s and early 2000s in two significant  ways. First, in a material sense, the fact that  open  source  software  was  such  high  qual- ity and did not have to cost much more than  the time necessary to master it, meant that a  greater user base had the opportunity to pro- duce highly sophisticated websites and web  applications.  Second,  it  provided  an  anal- ogy that, coupled with existing visions of the  web’s  participatory  potential,  made  it  seem  as if the web would make traditional media  companies obsolete. If a group of volunteers  spread across the world could outperform tra- ditional  software  companies  like  Microsoft  and Oracle, why couldn’t a group of bloggers  outperform CNN?  Slashdot as Early Example of a  Participatory Media Platform  The tech news site Slashdot.org is an impor- tant touchstone for understanding how open  source affected web production and provided  a  new  impulse  for  envisioning  the  web’s  impact on the media landscape. The site was  built  in  1997  by  a  21-year-old  programmer  named Rob Malda to publish, as he put it on  the  site’s  masthead,  ‘News  for  Nerds.  Stuff  that  Matters.’  The  site’s  audience  quickly  grew,  not  least  because  of  growing  excite- ment around Linux and other free software.  Built  largely  using  the  scripting  language  Perl,  the  site  was  continually  updated  with  new  features,  most  notably  a  streamlined  system  for  submitting  stories  to  Malda   and  the  site’s  other  editors  and  a  custom- built,  automated  moderation  system  that   distributed  the  work  of  moderation  to  the  site’s ‘trusted’ users  Stevenson, 2015 . The  site’s  infrastructure  helped  the  site’s  editors  deal  with  the  twin  problems  of  information  overload and entropy: measures were taken,  for example, to ensure submissions could be  efficiently organized and searched by editors,  while  the  moderation  system  allowed  users  to choose whether to see all comments or just  recommended  ones,  thus  minimizing  the  impact of spam, trolls and other undesirable  content. On top of these key features, Malda  regularly  added  features  for  personalizing  and  customizing  Slashdot,  so  that  readers  would  see  news  based  on  their  preferences,  as  well  as  expanding  the  ability  of  users  to  add  content  through  journals  and  a  social  networking  feature   ibid. .  Such  complex  systems  of  collaborative  media  production  and  consumption  had  not  previously  been  built, and although similar forms of collabo- rative filtering were increasingly being used  by  e-commerce  sites  like  Amazon  in  their  efforts  to  ‘profile’  consumers  and  recom- mend products  Elmer, 2003 , Slashdot rep- resented  the  first  application  of  such  technology in the context of web publishing.  As early as 1999, the site’s success prompted  commentators to call Slashdot ‘open source’  news  Glave, 1999 , and Slashdot eventually  formed a central example in Bruns’s theories  of ‘gatewatching’  Bruns, 2005  and ‘produs- age’  Bruns, 2008 .  Slashdot  not  only  foreshadowed  many  of  the  elements  we  recognize  as  part  of  social  media platforms today, but also hinted at crit- icisms that these later platforms are regularly  faced with. One recurring debate surrounded  the fact that Slashdot’s many features required  surveillance  in  the  form  of  authentication   i.e.,  registering  and  logging  into  the  site   and browser cookies  used so that the server  could ‘remember’ a user’s activities and pref- erences    Stevenson,  2015 .  This  breach  of  privacy was mitigated by the fact that users  were still allowed to read content and com- ment  anonymously,  but  nonetheless  it  high- lighted  the  potential  clash  between  creating    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  83  desirable interactivity, on the one hand, and  the potential for personal data to be used for  commercial  or  other  purposes. Another  cri- tique was that Slashdot did not offer enough  user  freedom,  as  editorial  control  was  ulti- mately in Malda’s hands even if certain ele- ments, such as moderation, were distributed  and automated. This critique was voiced by  Kevin Rose, founder of Slashdot’s competi- tor  Digg   Andrews,  2005 ,  and  the  subse- quent  exchanges  between  Malda  and  Rose   held  primarily  in  the  media,  e.g.,  Kushner,  2007  were an early example of debate sur- rounding ‘algorithmic gatekeeping,’ or auto- mated  forms  of  information  management  for  selecting,  ranking  and  recommending   content  Bozdag, 2013 .  Slashdot  was  an  early  example  of  ‘infor- mated  media,’  notable  not  just  for  enabling  user participation but for doing so in a way  that  automatically  incorporated  data  gener- ated  from  user  activity   Stevenson,  2015 .  This interest in experimenting with web tech- nology to create new media forms was also  apparent  in  Everything2   http:  everything2. com  , a site created by Malda’s friend Nate  Oostendorp.  Everything2  was  an  ambitious  project, a ‘flexible web database’ of individ- ual nodes  or ‘things’  and their links to other  nodes, each of which would be written by the  site’s users in an attempt to ‘find the best way  to  store  and  link  ideas’   Oosterdorp,  1999 .  Although  it  never  gained  the  audience  or  attention its creators hoped for, Everything2   like  Slashdot   was  notable  for  how  it  inte- grated a vision of participation and commu- nity with one of a highly-ordered information  medium – that is, how it articulated a hybrid  version of Rheingold’s vision of community  and  Berners-Lee’s  vision  of  the  web  as  an  information universe.  5. Web 2.0 and social media  So  far,  this  chapter  has  recounted  several  interrelated  strands  of  1990s  web  history:   early  visions  of  the  medium’s  potential  as  ‘information  universe’  and  ‘virtual  commu- nity,’  the  widespread  belief  that  the  web  would transform the media landscape and an  accompanying financial speculation, the var- ious attempts to define the dominant forms of   social   media  on  the  web,  and  the  rise  of  open-source  infrastructures  and  recommen- dation  systems  that  would  form  the  techno- logical  basis  for  social  media  platforms.  These  cultural,  economic  and  technological  developments  all  played  a  role  in  shaping  how the web would eventually be understood  as  ‘social.’  The  wave  of  social  media  plat- forms that began to appear in the early 2000s  and  promised  a  more  participatory  media  environment  were  imagined,  financed  and  built in ways that display continuity with the  early web.  Despite  the  many  connections  between  1990s  web  culture  and  our  present  social  media era, the transition was hardly routine.  In 2000 and 2001, the internet bubble burst.  Dot.com stock prices began to drop, and ini- tial  successes  like  Pets.com   an  online  pets  supply store  and Webvan  a grocery delivery  company   declared  bankruptcy  and  became  symbols  of  how  badly  investors  had  been  swindled. But as Dale Dougherty  an execu- tive  at  O’Reilly  Media   noted  in  2003,  cer- tain companies like Google seemed to have  come out of the stock market crash stronger,  and  what  appeared  to  make  these  compa- nies successful was similar to what enabled  a  new  wave  of  web  platforms  and  services  like Wikipedia, del.icio.us and  a year later   flickr to grow so quickly: namely, an ability  to ‘harness’ mass user activity in a way that  improved the overall product, as well as the  principle that the product itself was never ‘fin- ished.’  With  that  insight,  Dougherty  coined  the term ‘Web 2.0’ and O’Reilly Media held  its first annual Web 2.0 conference in 2004.  In  the  widely  cited  article  called  ‘What  is  Web  2.0?,’  O’Reilly   2005   argued  that  the  term  was  more  than  a  marketing  buzzword,  and  outlined  the  new  ‘rules’  for  building  a  successful web business. At the top of the list    84  was the idea of profiting from user contribu- tions:  the  basis  of  Google’s  search  engine  was the implicit participation of webmasters  whose  links  could  be  repurposed  to  index  and rank websites, much like Amazon repur- posed user activity  such as browsing, rank- ing  and  buying  products   in  order  to  make  better recommendations. As with Slashdot’s  rise to prominence a few years earlier, a key  analogy  for  this  kind  of  automated  media  production was once again open source soft- ware development. O’Reilly argued that the  key to harnessing collective intelligence was  building an ‘architecture of participation’ by  lowering  the  threshold  for  users  to  contrib- ute. In addition to leveraging user activity, an  important  characteristic  of Web  2.0  compa- nies  was  an  emphasis  on  building  valuable  databases. Web 2.0 thus brought together the  two distinct visions of the web’s nature out- lined at the beginning of this chapter. On the  one hand, Web 2.0 platforms like Wikipedia,  Digg and flickr, along with later social media  like  Facebook,  suggested  an  egalitarian  or  communitarian structure where anyone could  participate  and  no  central  authority  con- trolled  the  activities  of  users:  although  the  term  ‘virtual’  had  waned,  these  companies  and  platforms  certainly  encourage  charac- terizations of their users as a ‘community’ in  the sense that Rheingold meant it  for exam- ple,  see  the  many  ‘community  guidelines’  or  variations  thereof  found  on  social  media  platforms . On the other hand, social media  and Web  2.0  platforms  are  essentially  intri- cately  organized  information  systems,  and  because  of  this  resonate  strongly  with  the  ‘information universe’ imagined by Berners- Lee: the indexes and archives being created  by  Google,  Facebook  and  others  represent  impressive  attempts  to  create  useful  refer- ence  media  out  of  the  vast  databases  each  of these companies own. Similar to Berners- Lee’s ambition of creating a ‘semantic web,’  their efforts represent a desire to create uni- versal  data  formats  to  allow  search  engines  and other applications to distinguish between  entities and to map their relationships – such   work  clearly  has  commercial  implications,  but  must  also  be  understood  critically  in  terms  of  the  epistemological  and  ontologi- cal assumptions they carry  for an introduc- tion  to  the  semantic  web  and  discussion  of  its relationship to Web 2.0, see, for example,  McCool  2005, 2006 ; for a critique of epis- temology and ontology of the semantic web  and similar schemes, see Cramer  2007  .  Similarities  with  the  ‘virtual  commu- nity’  and  ‘information  universe’  should  not  obscure  the  fact  that Web  2.0  is  as  much  a  business  concept  as  it  is  a  grand  vision  of  the  web’s  distinctive  nature.  Where  ‘par- ticipation’  often  has  a  positive  connotation  and  implies  collective  action   such  as  with  democratic  or  civic  participation ,  here  the  meaning was much more neutral. Effectively  building  an  architecture  of  participation,  O’Reilly  argued,  was  not  so  much  a  matter  of  inspiring  volunteers  but  of  ensuring  that  ‘participation’  happened  even  when  users  acted  out  of  self-interest  –  for  example,  although  one  might  actively  rate  or  review  products  on  Amazon   and  even  receive  the  prestige and perks of being a ‘Vine Voice’ or  trusted reviewer , one already contributes to  Amazon’s efforts to improve its recommen- dations simply by browsing the site or buying  a product. Terranova  2004  argues that such  models benefit from users’ ‘free labor,’ while  Gehl   2014:  23   similarly  points  out  that  social  media  and  Web  2.0  platforms  profit  from users’ ‘affective processing’ of the valu- able archives they control. Likewise, the uto- pian  connotations  of  knowledge  graphs  and  social  graphs  are  countered  by  the  obvious  commercial  aims  guiding  Facebook’s  and  Google’s actions. As Gehl argues in relation  to  Facebook,  it  is  important  to  see  how  the  particular variables and values it incorporates  into its  database – from  demographics such  as  age,  education  and  occupation  to  vari- ous ‘likes’ or interests such as one’s favorite  music  or  movies  –  match  closely  with  the  needs of advertisers  Gehl, 2014: 92–116 .  Finally,  it’s  worth  noting  that  O’Reilly’s  Web  2.0  article  closely  followed  the  format    FroM hyPertext to hyPe and baCk again  85  of Wired’s celebrations of the emerging dot. com  bubble,  in  that  it  portrayed  a  radically  altered media landscape as a foregone conclu- sion. Web 2.0 was not just a dry description  of  business  concepts,  but  a  reconfiguration  of  the  web’s  promise  of  a  more  open  and  participatory media environment. As new as  Web 2.0 seemed, and as disruptive as the lat- est social media startups appear to be today, it  is important to understand that these concepts  and  companies  emerge  from  historical  pro- cesses,  not  least  from  evolving  understand- ings of what the web is and what ‘works’ on  it, which themselves are products of cultural,  social  and  economic  processes.  Meanwhile,  our understanding of web history is itself still  taking shape, and it is hard to overstate how  much  work  is  being  carried  out,  or  will  be,  to preserve and study the medium’s history.  The importance of such work should not be  underestimated, as any attempt to understand  and  determine  the  future  of  the  web  and  social media will benefit greatly from further  efforts to uncover their past.

This page intentionally left blank   PART II Approaches and Methods   This page intentionally left blank   5 Digital Methods for   Cross-platform Analysis  R i c h a r d   R o g e r s  digiTal meThods afTer social  media  Increasingly  employed  as  an  umbrella  term  for tool-based methods employed in the digi- tal  humanities  and  e-social  sciences,  digital  methods  have  as  their  point  of  departure  a  series  of  heuristics  with  respect  to  how  to  study  online  media   Rogers,  2013b .  The  first  historicises  the  web  as  an  object  of  study, one that has undergone a transforma- tion  from  a   virtual   site  for  the  study  of  online culture specifically to a source of data  about  broader  societal  and  cultural  trends.  Second,  to  extract  the  data  one  not  only  employs  crawlers,  scrapers, API  logins  and  manual  means,  but  also  pays  special  atten- tion to ‘query design’ and ‘search as research’  for  creating  tweet  collections  or  sets  of  Facebook pages for social media analysis. To  study  those  ‘natively  digital’  source  sets,  digital  methods  learn  from  the  methods  of  the  medium,  e.g.,  recommendation  systems   such  as  trending  topics  or  newsfeeds.  How  may  platform  treatments  of  retweets  and  likes  for example  be repurposed for study- ing  the  unfolding  of  historical  events   on  Twitter , or the most engaged with memes in  a political campaign  on Facebook ? Digital  methods,  finally,  consider  the  conditions  of  proof. When does it makes sense to ground  the findings  about the versions of historical  events represented by Google search results,  for example  in the particular characteristics  and  influences  of  online  data,  and  when  is  ‘online groundedness’ less robust than mixed  methods approaches?  One  of  the  earliest  digital  methods  maps  the  hyperlinking  patterns  between  web- sites  involved  in  the  same  social  issue  area  so  as  to  study  the  politics  of  association  of  actors  from  the  purposively  made  as  well  as  the  missing  links.  The  IssueCrawler,  the  software  tool  developed  in  the  early  2000s  or  the  so-called  web  1.0  era,  provides  a  ‘programmed method’ for studying associa- tions  in  issue  networks  online,  or  clutches    92  figure 5.1  comparison of search volume for [web 2.0], [social networking sites] and [social  media], according to google Trends, 19 november 2015  of NGOs, funders, think tanks, academics as  well  as  databases,  widgets  and  other  online  objects,  working  on  or  serving  a  particular  issue  Bruns, 2007; Rogers, 2009a; Borra and  Rieder, 2014 . Once the links between actors  have  been  found,  one  may  begin  to  study  association as well as the organisation of net- worked publics  Latour, 2005; Ito, 2008 .  More recently, by calling for a move from  ‘so-called  web  1.0  http  or  html  approaches  to  2.0  cross  platform  based  methods,’  Greg  Elmer and Ganaele Langlois  2013: 45  argue  that  to  study  the  web  these  days  requires  new  methods  that  step  past  the  hyperlink  as the pre-eminent digital object tying it all  together.  They  issue  a  much  larger  invita- tion  to  rethink  the  web  more  generally  as  an  object  of  study,  recognising  its  increas- ing  platformisation,  or  the  mass  movement  by  web  users  to  social  media   Helmond,  2015 . In the shift from an info-web  1.0  to a  social web  2.0 , recommendations are made  through  the  participation  of  platform  users  rather than only by site webmasters  to use a  throwback term .1 That is, recommendations,   especially in the news feeds of platforms, fol- low from ‘friends’’ activity, such as ‘liking’  and ‘sharing’. The content recommendations  thereby distinguish themselves epistemologi- cally from those derived from site owners or  webmasters’ linking to another webpage for  referencing  or  other  purposes.2  Following  Tim O’Reilly, here the terms ‘web 1.0’ and  ‘web  2.0’  have  been  used   or  overused   to  periodise  not  only  the  transition  from  the  info-web to the social web, but also from the  open web to the closed web or the walled gar- dens  of  platforms   O’Reilly,  2005;  Dekker  and Wolfsberger, 2009 .  On the Web’s 25th anniversary in 2014, Tim  Berners-Lee,  who  ‘slowly,  but  steadily’  has  come to be known as its inventor, called for  its ‘re-decentralisation’, breaking down new  media  concentration  and  near  monopolies  online working as walled gardens without the  heretofore  open  spirit   Berners-Lee,  2014    Agar, 2001: 371 . The web’s ‘app-ification’  is  analogous.  Next  to  increased  government  Internet  censorship,  mass  surveillance  and  punitive copyright laws, Berners-Lee  2014     digital Methods For Cross-PlatForM analysis   93  lists  ‘corporate  walled  gardens’  or  social  media  platforms  as  grave  concerns  related  to the very future of the web and its mobile  counterpart.  Langlois  and  Elmer’s  point,  however,  implies  that  one  should  not  only  periodise  and critique the dominant phases of the web,  but also do the same for its methods of study.  There  are  those  digital  methods  that  rely  on  hyperlinks,  and  thereby  are  in  a  sense  still  committed  to  an  info-web,  and  those  that  have taken on board ‘likes’, ‘shares’ and other  forms  of  valuation  and  currency   such  as  ‘comments’ and ‘liked comments’  on online  platforms. Indeed, this analytical periodisation  is reflected in the much broader study of value  online, reflected in the rise of the ‘like econ- omy’  over  the  ‘link  economy’   Gerlitz  and  Helmond, 2013 . As a case in point, Google’s  Web  Search  once  valued  links  higher  than  other signals  Hindman, 2008; Rieder, 2012 .  Through  the  rise  of  user  clicks  as  a  source  adjudication  measure,  one  could  argue  that  Google Web Search, too, is valuing the social  web  over  the  document  or  semantic  match- ing  of  the  info-web   van  Couvering,  2007 .  Metrification  online,  which  starts  with  like  counts and follower numbers and progresses  towards Klout scores, similarly considers and  makes rankings social. Thus the new analyt- ics,  both  Google’s  updated  ones  as  well  as  Klout’s, are oriented to a web gone social.  The  notion  of  web  2.0   and  the  related  idea of the social web  brought with it as its  apparent  forerunner  web  1.0   with  a  more  informational set of metaphors , but beyond  the  versioning  rhetoric  web  2.0  itself  has  been supplanted first by ‘social network ing   sites’ and ‘platforms’ and later just by ‘social  media’  boyd and Ellison, 2007; Beer, 2008;  Scholz, 2008; Allen, 2013   see Figure 5.1 .  The  early  distinction  between  social  net- working sites and social network sites, ush- ered in by boyd and Ellison, was normative  as  well  as  analytical.  Social  media  users  ought  to  have  an  interest  to  connect  with  others online other than for the purposes of  ‘networking’,  which  would  suggest  a  kind   of  neoliberal  activity  of  making  sure  that  even one’s social life  online  is productive.  In  a  sense,  the  authors  also  anticipated  the  nuancing of social media into platform types,  such  as  the  ones  for  business   LinkedIn ,  family   Facebook   and  professional  doings   Twitter , though social media user practices  in each remain diverse. Whether for network- ing or to connect with one’s existing network,  the analytical call made by boyd and Ellison  seemed to be directed to the study of profiles  and friends  together with friending .  The purposive use of the term ‘platform’,  as Tarleton Gillespie  2010  has pointed out,  could  be  viewed  as  particularly  enticing  for  users to populate an otherwise empty database,  thereby generating value for the companies.  Platforms  connote  voice-giving  infrastruc- ture, where one can express one’s viewpoints   political or otherwise , rise up, and make an  online project of oneself. Polishing the pro- file, friending, uploading videos and photos,  and liking, sharing and commenting become  not only newly dominant forms of sociality,  but  a  kind  of  labour  for  a  platform  owned  by others  Scholz, 2016 . Cooperative, user- owned  platforms  would  provide  alterna- tives.  Other  critical  calls  for  the  analysis  of  Facebook have been made, certain of which  have resulted in invitations to leave the plat- form,  to  liberate  oneself  or  even  to  commit  so-called  Facebook  suicide,  which  would  allow you ‘to meet your real neighbours’, as  suicidemachine.org’s  software  project’s  slo- gan has it  Portwood-Stacer, 2013; Facebook  Liberation Army, 2015 .  As  web  2.0  has  given  way  to  social  network ing   sites,  platforms  and,  finally,  social  media,  social  media  methods  also  have  evolved.  In  particular,  digital  methods  for  social  media  analysis  initially  relied  on  social  network  analysis   the  study  of  inter- linked  friends   as  well  as  profiles  and  the  presentation  of  self.  For  example,  Netvizz,  the Facebook data extraction software, origi- nally was considered a tool to map one’s own  Facebook  friend  network   Rieder,  2013 .  The  early  digital  methods  work  on  social    94  networking  sites  similarly  studied  friends  and  profiles.  Dubbed  ‘post-demographics’,  this approach to studying profiles considered  preferences  and  tastes  as  a  starting  point  of  analysis as opposed to gender, age, education  and such  Rogers, 2009b . One study exam- ined the interests of presidential candidates’  MySpace  ‘friends’.  Did  Barack  Obama’s  friends and John McCain’s friends share the  same  favourite  television  shows,  movies,  heroes,  and  books,  or  was  there  a  distinc- tive politics to media taste and consumption?   For the most part, they did not share tastes  and thus TV shows and the other preferences  could be considered to have politics of con- sumption   Rogers,  2013b .   In  the  case  of  Netvizz friend-network mapping, as well as  post-demographics,  these  methods  could  be  called  digital  methods  for  social  media  1.0,  for they concerned themselves with profiles,  friends and networking.  More  recently,  attention  to  social  media  in  digital  methods  work  has  been  directed  towards events, disasters, elections and revo- lutions,  first  through  the  so-called  ‘Twitter  revolution’  surrounding  the  Iran  election  crisis   2009   and  later  the  Arab  Spring   2011–2012 .  Instead  of  starting  with  user  profiles,  friend  networks  or  networking,  such studies collect tweets containing one or  more hashtags such as iranelection  perhaps  together with queried keywords , or focus on  one particular Facebook page, such as We are  all Khaled Said  Gaffney, 2010; Lotan et al.,  2011; Rieder et al., 2015 .  Many of the more recent methods to ana- lyse platforms rest upon and also derive from  the  individual APIs  that  Twitter,  Facebook,  Instagram,  YouTube  and  others  have  to  offer.  As  data  are  increasingly  offered  and  delivered by polling one API, and no longer  screen-scraped  or  crawled  from  multiple  websites   as  in  the  days  of  the  info-web ,  most  work  is  a  study  of  a  page  or  multiple  pages   and  groups   on  Facebook,  or  one  concerning  tweets  containing  one  or  more  hashtags and keywords on Twitter. In social  media  analysis  with  digital  methods,  in   other  words,  ‘single-platform  studies’  have  become the norm.  If  there  were  a  significant  turning  point  towards  single-platform  studies  steered  by  the API  rather than by scraping , it may have  been  the  critique  of  a  2008  social  network  analysis  of  tastes  and  ties  that  used  college  students’ Facebook data  Lewis et al., 2008;  Zimmer,  2010;  Marres  and  Weltevrede,  2013 .  It  concerned  a  set  of  presumably  anonymised users from a so-called renowned  university  in  the  northeast  of  the  United  States. Not so unlike the effects of the release  of AOL user search histories in 2006, its pub- lishing  prompted  detective  work  to  uncover  the identities of the users, who turned out to  be Harvard College students from the gradu- ating class of 2009  Zimmer, 2008 . Michael  Zimmer,  both  in  the  detective  work  as  well  as in the reflection upon the way forward for  social  media  method,  entitled  his  critique,  ‘But the data is already public’, echoing one  of the remarks by an author of the study. In  giving  rise  to  a  sharper  focus  on  ethics  in  web studies more generally, coinciding with  a decline in scraping, Zimmer argued that in  the Harvard study users’ so-called contextual  privacy  was  violated,  for  not  only  did  they  not  give  informed  content,  but  they  did  not  expect  their  publicly  available  data  to  be  stored in a researcher’s database and matched  with  their  student  housing  data  for  even  greater  analytical  scrutiny  of  their  ties  and  tastes   Nissenbaum,  2009 .  The  actual  data  collection is described by the researchers as  ‘downloading’ the profile and friend network  data  directly  from  Facebook,  prior  to  the  release of Facebook API 1.0 in 2010. In other  words, the data were obtained or scraped in  some  non-API  manner,  albeit  with  permis- sion  from  Facebook  as  well  as  Harvard  for  the  project  funded  by  the  National  Science  Foundation and approved by the university’s  ethics  review  board.  Ultimately,  in  the  evo- lution  of  its  API  to  version  2.0   in  2014 ,  Facebook  would  remove  permissions  to  access  friends’  data  such  as  ties  and  tastes   i.e., friends and likes, together with profiles ,    digital Methods For Cross-PlatForM analysis   95  thereby  making   sociometric   social  net- work analysis like the one performed in the  Harvard  study  improbable,  including  even  those of one’s own network with all friends’  privacy settings adhered to, as one would do  with  Netvizz   Facebook,  2016 .  ‘Internal’  studies  still  may  be  performed,  which  Facebook  data  scientists  also  took  advan- tage  of  with  their  ‘emotional  contagion’  experiment   Kramer  et  al.,  2014 .  The  data  science study  of some 700,000 users with a  corpus of 3 million posts  analysed the risks  associated  with  the  Facebook  news  feed.  Is  user  exposure  to  positive  or  negative  posts  psychologically  risky   Meyer,  2015 ?  The  study found that negative posts run the risk  of  ‘emotional  contagion’.  In  order  to  make  the  findings,  Facebook  selectively  removed  negative  posts  from  users’  news  feeds.  The  ethics  of  the  study  were  similarly  ques- tioned, for the users were unaware  and not  informed   that  their  news  feeds  were  being  altered  and  their  moods  measured,  however  seemingly impractical and obtrusive it would  be to gain such permission  Puschmann and  Bozdag,  2014 .  Among  the  ethical  issues  raised,  one  concerned  whether  researchers  can rely on the terms of service as cover for  the otherwise lack of informed consent. Are  users  agreeing  to  being  analysed  for  more  than improvement of the site and services, as  is usually stated? To the letter, they are not.  It  is  worthwhile  to  recall  from  the  AOL  case that the 62-year-old search engine user  told the New York Times that she never imag- ined that her queries would be made public,  or that she would have to explain to anyone  that  her  information-seeking  about  medical  conditions  was  undertaken  for  her  friends   Barbaro  and  Zeller,  2006 .  In  joining  a  lawsuit  brought  against AOL  at  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  the  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation  published  highly  personal  and  salacious query histories from unnamed indi- viduals;  another  user’s  search  engine  query  history was made into the mini-documentary,  ‘I  Love  Alaska:  The  heartbreaking  search  history of AOL user 711391’, by the Dutch   artists  and  filmmakers  Lernert  Engelberts  and  Sander  Plug   2009 ,  who  were  asked  subsequently  by  the  broadcasting  company  to  seek  out  the  identity  of  the  woman,  now  intimately known.  Ultimately, they did not.   Neither the study of Harvard College’s 2009  graduating  class  nor  the  emotional  conta- gion study appears to have led to the subjects  being  identified  and  in  some  way  harmed  through outing. It is also not straightforward  to  claim  that  informed  consent  would  have  been enough to preclude harm, given that the  users may be unable to foresee the potential  hazards of participation  van de Poel, 2009 .  hashTag and  liked  page  sTudies  With the decline of scraping and the rise of  issues surrounding human subject research in  social media, the API-led studies  on events,  disasters,  elections,  revolutions  and  social  causes   rely  increasingly  on  such  content- organising  elements  as  the  hashtag   for  Twitter  and the  liked  page  for Facebook .  Each is taken in turn, so as eventually to dis- cuss  with  which  limitations  one  may  study  them concurrently across platforms.  The Twitter hashtag, put forward by Chris  Messina  in  2007,  was  originally  conceived  as a means to set up ‘channel tags’, borrow- ing  from  similar  practices  in  Internet  Relay  Chat   IRC .  The  proposal  was  to  organise  ‘group-like  activity’  on  Twitter  that  would  be  ‘folksonomic’,  meaning  user-generated  rather  than  an  editorial  or  taxonomic  prac- tice  by  the  company  or  its  syndicated  part- ners,  as  in  Snapchat’s  ‘Stories’   Messina,  2007 .  Messina  also  proposed  to  provide  a  ranked  list  of  the  channel  tags  by  activity,  i.e., most active ones in the past twenty-four  hours,  showing  on  the  interface  where  the  activity  is.  This  feature  is  similar  to  trend- ing topics which Jack Dorsey, co-founder of  Twitter,  described  a  year  later  as  ‘what  the  world  considers  important  in  this  moment’    96   Dorsey,  2008 . With  hashtags  and  trending  topics,  Twitter  not  only  gained  new  func- tionality but became a rather novel object of  study for what could be termed both on-the- ground and ‘remote event analysis’. As such,  it  thus  distinguishes  itself  from  Dorsey’s  original Twitter,  created  to  provide  what  he  called ‘personal immediacy – seeing what’s  happening in my world right now’  Dorsey,  2008 .  Dorsey  himself,  in  the  interviews  he  gave  for  the  Los Angeles Times  after  his  temporary ouster as CEO, acknowledged the  shift  away  from  this  more  intimate  Twitter,  saying  Twitter  thrives  on  ‘natural  disasters,  man-made  disasters,  events,  conferences,  presidential  elections’   Sarno,  2009 .  In  the  event,  the  study  of  Twitter  as  a  space  for  ambient friend-following yielded, at least for  a  share  of  Twitter  studies,  to  that  of  event-  following,  which  is  another  way  of  distin- guishing between digital methods for social  media analysis 1.0 and 2.0  Rogers, 2013a .  Not  so  unlike  Google  Trends  that  list  the  year’s  most  sought  key  words   with  a  geographical  distribution ,  Twitter’s  initial  cumulative list of the year’s trending topics,  published  in  2009,  provides  a  rationale  for  the attention granted to the study of the sin- gle hashtag for events. In the announcement  made  by  the  Twitter  data  scientist,  Abdur  Chowdhury   who  incidentally  was  head  of  AOL Research when the search history data  were  released ,  one  notes  how  serious  con- tent began to take a prominent place in a ser- vice once known primarily for its banality. In  2009  ‘Twitter  users  found  the  Iranian  elec- tions the most engaging topic of the year. The  terms iranelection, Iran and Tehran were all  in the top-21 of Trending Topics, and iran- election  finished  in  a  close  second  behind  the  regular  weekly  favorite  musicmonday’   Chowdhury,  2009 .  Some  years  later  the  universal list of trending topics became per- sonalised  according  to  whom  one  follows  and one’s geographical coordinates, however  much  one  may  change  one’s  location  and  personalise  trending  topics  exclusively  by  new location. In some sense the change from   universal to personalised results  like Google  Web  Search’s  similar  move  in  December  2009,  which  Eli  Pariser   2011   relies  upon  for his notion the ‘filter bubble’  made trends  more  unassailable,  for  no  longer  could  one  call  into  question  why  a  particular  hashtag   like  occupywallstreet   was  not  trending  when it perhaps should have been  Gillespie,  2012 . Trending topics are in a sense now co- authored  by  the  Twitter  user,  making  them  less compelling to study at least as a cultural  barometer.  The exception is trending topics  that are location-based only.   While  the  single  hashtag,  or  more  likely  a  combination  of  hashtags  and  keywords,  remain  a  prominent  starting  point  for  mak- ing  tweet  collections  to  study  events,  disas- ters, elections, revolutions and social causes,  as  well  as  subcultures,  movements,  stock  prices, celebrity awards and cities, research- ers have widely expanded their repertoire for  assembling  them,  first  through  techniques  of  capturing  follower,  reply  and  mention  networks,  and  subsequently  using  the  1%  random  sample  made  available  by  Twitter,  geotagged  tweets  and  the  Twitter  ID  num- berspace in combination with time zones to  identify  national Twitter  spheres   Crampton  et al., 2013; Gerlitz and Rieder, 2013; Bruns  et al., 2014 .  Network analysis remains a preferred ana- lytical  technique  in  digital  methods  work,  and  as  such  it  endures  in  the  transition  to  method 2.0, but one somewhat novel strand  of  work  worthy  of  mention  here  concerns  Twitter content studies, discussed by way of  a brief analytical tool description  Venturini  et al., 2014b; Kennedy and Hill, 2016 .  The  Twitter  Capture  and  Analysis  Tool   TCAT  can be installed on one’s own server  to  capture  tweets  for  analysis   Borra  and  Rieder,  2014 .  Researchers  thereby  make  individual  tweet  collections,  instead  of  hav- ing  one  or  more  larger  databases  that  are  collaboratory-like repositories. Such archival  fragmentation could not be avoided, because  Twitter,  once  rather  open,  changed  its  terms  of  service  upon  becoming  a  publicly  traded    digital Methods For Cross-PlatForM analysis   97  figure 5.2  netvizz output showing the share, like and comments count  as well as its sum of  ‘engagement’  of two urls on facebook url  normalized_url  share_  count  1775  like_  count  2667  comment_ count  total_  count  1087    5229  http:  www.nytimes.com    http:  www.nytimes.com    2015 12 08 opinion how-isis-  makes-radicals.html  2015 12 08 opinion how-isis-  makes-radicals.html  https:  theintercept.com    https:  www.theintercept.com    5995  5623  2396  14014  drone-papers   drone-papers   company,  no  longer  allowing  the  sharing  of  tweet  collections   Puschmann  and  Burgess,  2013 .  Thus  researchers  must  curate  their  own.  The  TCAT  tool,  installed  on  a  server   with  GitHub  instructions ,  enables  tweet  collection-making   gathered  from  both  the  streaming and the REST API  and provides a  battery of network analyses: social graph by  mentions, social graph by in_reply to status_ id, co-hashtag, bipartite hashtag-user, bipartite  hashtag-mention,  bipartite  hashtag-URL  and  bipartite  hashtag-host.  There  are  also  mod- ules,  however,  that  direct  attention  towards  forms  of  content  analysis  that  are  ‘quanti- quali’ and referred to as ‘networked content  analysis’  Niederer, 2016 . By quanti-quali is  meant that a quantitative, winnowing analysis   not  so  unlike  sampling   is  performed  so  as  to  enable  not  only  a  ‘computational  herme- neutics’ but also a thicker description  Mohr  et al., 2015 . Quanti-quali is preferred over the  more usual quali-quanti moniker, owing to the  order of the methodological steps  Venturini  et  al.,  2014a .  Departing  from  a  collection  of 600,000 tweets gathered through a single  hashtag,  an  example  of  such  an  approach  is  the  iranelection  RT  project,  which  sought  to  turn  Twitter  into  a  story-telling  machine  of events on the ground and in social media  by ordering the top three retweeted tweets per  day, and placing them in chronological order,  as opposed to the reverse chronological order  of Twitter  Rogers et al., 2009 . iranelection  RT  relied  on  manual  retweeting   where  the  user types RT in the tweet , whereas the TCAT  module  outputs,  chronologically,  ‘identical  tweet frequency’, or narrowly defined ‘native’   retweets. Other forms of quanti-quali content  analysis with a tweet collection are hashtag as  well as URL frequency list-making to study  hierarchies  of  concern  and  most-referred-to  content. It is the starting point for a form of  content analysis that treats a hashtag as  for  example  an embedded social cause or move- ment   blacklivesmatter   and  URLs  a  web- page such as a news story or YouTube video.  The   often  fleeting   ‘hashtag  publics’  mobi- lise around a social cause not only phatically   and affectively  but also with content  Bruns  and Burgess, 2011; Bruns and Burgess, 2015;  Papacharissi,  2015 .  Networked  content  analysis considers how and to what substan- tive  ends  the  network  filters  stories,  mobi- lises particular media formats over others and  circulates  urgency   geographically ,  attract- ing  bursty  or  sustained  attention  that  may  be  measured.  Techniques  of  studying  social  causes  using  hashtags  in  Twitter  as  well  as  Instagram are discussed below, including how  to consider whether to downplay or embrace  medium effects.  ‘public   conversations’,   While,  since  June  2013,  Facebook  has  included  hashtags  as  proposed  means  of  organising  the  straightforward  ‘cross-platform  analysis’  of  Twitter  and  Facebook  using  the  same  hashtags  is  likely  fraught.  The  study  of  Facebook ‘content’ relies far more on other  activities,  such  as  liking,  sharing  and  com- menting, which is known as studying ‘most  engaged with content’  and is available in the  Netvizz  data  outputs    see  Figure  5.2 .  For  cross-platform  work,  the  co-appearances  of  URLs   aka  co-links   amplified  perhaps  by    98  ‘likes’  Facebook’s as well as Twitter’s hith- erto  favorites   may  yield  far  more  material  for comparative resonance analysis.  From  the  beginning  Facebook   unlike  Friendster and MySpace before it  positioned  itself  as  a  social  network  site  that  would  reflect  one’s  own  proper  circle  of  friends  and  acquaintances,  thereby  challenging  the  idea that online friends should be considered  ‘friends’  with  quotation  marks  and  thereby  a  problematic  category  worthy  of  special  ‘virtual’  study.  In  a  sense,  such  a  friend  designation  could  be  interpreted  as  another  mid-2000  marker  of  the  end  of  cyberspace.  Together  with  the  demise  of  serendipitous   and  aimless   surfing,  the  rise  of  national  jurisdictions  legislating   and  censoring   the  Internet and the reassertion of local language   and  local  advertising   as  organising  princi- ples  of  browsing,  Facebook  also  re-ordered  the  web,  doing  away  with  cyberspace  in  at  least  two  senses. As AOL  once  did  with  its  portal,  Facebook  sought  to  attract  and  keep  users by making the web ‘safe,’ first as a US  college website offering registration only to  on-campus users with an .edu email address,  and then later as it expanded beyond the col- leges by ID-ing users or otherwise thwarting  practices of anonymisation  Stutzman et al.,  2013 . This was an effort to prevent so-called  ‘fakesters’,  and  thus  distinguish  itself  from  online platforms like MySpace, which were  purportedly  rife  with  lurkers  and  stalkers  as well as publicised cases of sex offenders  masquerading  as  youngsters   boyd,  2013 .  Facebook’s  web  was  also  clean,  swept  of  visual clutter. In contrast to MySpace, it did  not  offer  customisation,  skinning  or  ‘pimp- ing’,  so  one’s  profile  picture  and  the  friend  thumbnails  would  be  set  in  a  streamlined,  blue interface without starry nights, unicorns  and double rainbows surrounding the posts.  Facebook’s  safe  and  de-cluttered  web  brought  a  series  of  ‘cyberspace’  research  practices down to earth as well, cleaning up  or at least making seem uncouth such prac- tices as scraping websites for data. For one,  scraping social network sites for data became   a  privacy and proprietary  concern and also  a  practice  actively  blocked  by  Facebook.  Data  would  be  served  on  Facebook’s  terms  through its API  as mentioned above , and the  politics  and  practices  of APIs   more  gener- ally  would become objects of study  Bucher,  2013 . In this case, terms-of-service-abiding,  non-scraping  data  extraction  tools   such  as  Netvizz   would  reside  on  Facebook  itself  as apps, and require vetting and approval by  the  company.  Be  it  through  the  developers’  gateway  or  a  tool  on  Facebook,  one  would  log in, and the data available would respect  one’s own as well as the other users’ privacy  settings, eventually putting paid to the open- ended opportunities social network sites were  thought to provide to social network research.  With the API as point of access, Facebook as  an object of study has undergone a transition  from the primacy of the profile and friends’  networks  tastes and ties  to that of the page  or  group,  and  with  it  from  the  presentation  of  self  to  social  causes   which  I’m  using  as  a  shorthand  for  events,  disasters,  elec- tions,  revolutions,  and  so  forth .  In  a  sense  the company’s acquisition, Instagram, could  be  said  to  have  supplanted  Facebook  as  the  preferred object of study of the self through  its ambassadorship of selfie culture, however  much its initiator would like the company to  take the route of Twitter, at once debanalising  and  becoming  a  news  and  event-following  medium,  too   Goel,  2015;  Senft  and  Baym,  2015 .  If,  with  the  API,  Facebook  analysis  is  steered  towards  the  pages  of  social  causes,  ‘liking’  is  no  longer  considered  as  frivo- lous,  and  like-based  engagement  analyses  gain more weight. As a case in point liking  a page with photos of brutal acts of violence  requires the like button to be re-appropriated,  as  Amnesty  International   and  other  advo- cacy organisations  are wont to do by asking  one  not  to  take  liking  lightly   or  communi- cate  only  phatically   but  to  see  liking  as  an  act of solidarity with a cause or support for  a campaign. While it has been dismissed as a  form of slacktivism  which requires little or    digital Methods For Cross-PlatForM analysis   99  no effort and has little or no effect , liking as  a form of engagement has been studied more  extensively, with scholars attributing to but- ton clicking on Facebook distinctive forms of  liking causes: ‘ 1  socially responsible liking,   2  emotional liking,  3  informational liking,   3   social  performative  liking,   5   low-cost  liking and 6  routine liking’  Brandtzaeg and  Haugstveit, 2014: 258 . In the event, low-cost  liking would be especially slacktivist, though  all  forms  of  liking  in  the  list  also  could  be  construed  as  a  form  of  attention-granting  with  scant  impact,  as  was  once  said  of  the  ‘CNN effect’ when all the world’s proverbial  eyes are watching – but not acting  Robinson,  2002 .  The  question  of  whether  liking  as  a  form  of  engagement  substitutes  for  other  forms,  however,  has  been  challenged,  for  social  media  activism,  it  is  argued,  aids  in  accumulating  action  and  action  potential   Christensen, 2011 . It is also where the peo- ple are  online .  from single plaTform To   cross-plaTform sTudies  Social movement, collective action and more  recently  ‘connective  action’  researchers  in  particular have long called for multiple plat- form,  and  multi-media,  analysis   to  use  an  older term . In an extensive study based on  interviews,  Sasha  Costanza-Chock   2014 ,  for  one,  has  deemed  the  immigrant  rights  movement  in  the  United  States  a  form  of  ‘transmedia organising’. The cross-platform  approach  is  a  deliberate  strategy,  and  each  platform  is  approached  and  utilised  sepa- rately for its own qualities and opportunities.  Here one may recall the distinction made by  Henry  Jenkins   2006   between  cross-media   the same story for all platforms  and trans- media   the  story  unfolds  differently  across  platforms . Thus social media, when used as  a ‘collapsed category’, masks significant dif- ferences  in  ‘affordances’   Costanza-Chock,  2014: 61–66 .  I return to a similar problem   concerning collapsed digital objects such as  hashtags  or  likes  across  platforms  with  dif- ferent  user  cultures.   If  we  are  to  follow  Jenkins,  as  well  as  Costanza-Chock,  a  dis- cussion of cross-platform analysis would be  more  aptly  described  as  trans-platform  analysis.  Researchers  studying  social  causes  on  platforms have also called for ‘uncollapsing’  social media. Lance Bennett and Alexandra  Segerberg, who coined the notion of ‘connec- tive  action’  as  a  counter-point  to  collective  action,  argue  that  to  understand  the  forces  behind social change one should study those  multiple platforms that allow for ‘personal- ized  public  engagement’,  instead  of  choos- ing one platform and its API in advance of  the analysis  Bennett and Segerberg, 2012 .  It is, in other words, an implicit critique of  the  single-platform  studies   as  collapsed  social  media  studies   that  rely  solely  on  Twitter  for  one  issue   e.g.,  Fukushima  in  Japan  or Facebook for another  e.g., rise of  right-wing populism , when one could have  ample cause to study them across media. It  is not only the silo-ing of APIs that prompts  single-platform  studies;  as  pointed  out,  the  question of the comparability of the ‘same’  objects across platforms  likes, hashtags  is  at issue.  One of Bennett and Segerberg’s preferred  tools  is  the  IssueCrawler,  developed  at  the  Digital  Methods  Initiative,  which  could  be  described  as  web  1.0  analytical  software,  relying on the info-web’s link and perform- ing hyperlink analysis. For multiple-platform   and  transmedia   analysis  à  la  Bennett  and  Segerberg it could be employed as an explor- atory  instrument  at  the  outset  of  a  study  of  a  cause   on  the  web ,  in  order  to  ascertain  which  websites   including  blogs   and  plat- forms  are  the  focus  of  attention.  In  other  words, hyperlink analysis could be construed  as  a  web  1.0  methodological  starting  point  for  multi-platform  analysis.  As  described  below,  other  ‘inter-linkings’   broadly  con- ceived  may be studied, such as co-linked and  inter-liked content.   100  plaTform culTures of use  The purpose of the exercise here is to develop  cross-platform  methods,  or  digital  methods  for cross-platform studies, where one learns  from medium methods and repurposes them  for  social  and  cultural  research.  It  begins  with a sensitivity to distinctive user cultures  and subcultures, whereby hashtags and likes,  digital  objects  used  to  organise  and  boost  content   among  other  reasons ,  should  not  necessarily be treated as if they are employed  equivalently across all platforms, even when  present. For example, Instagram has inflated  hashtag use compared to Twitter’s, allowing  up  to  30  tags   and  far  more  characters  per  photo caption post than Twitter grants for a  tweet .  That  is,  users  may  copy  and  paste  copious  quantities  of  hashtags  in  Instagram  posts   see  Table  5.1 .  Twitter  recommends  that one ‘[does not] spam with hashtags.  Don’t over-tag a single Tweet.  Best practices  recommend  using  no  more  than  2  hashtags  per  Tweet. ’   Twitter,  2016 . While  present,  hashtags are under-utilised on Facebook.  A  series  of  questions  arises  concerning  the  meaning  of  the  term  ‘cross’  in  ‘cross- platform  analysis’.  First,  across  which  plat- forms are ‘hashtags’ worthy of study  Twitter,  Instagram,  Tumblr ,  which  ones  ‘likes’  Instagram,  YouTube,  Twitter,   Facebook,  Pinterest ,  which  ones  ‘retweets’  or  ‘repins’   Twitter,  Pinterest ,  which  one  ‘@mentions’   Twitter , which ones ‘links’, including short- ened URLs  not Instagram , and so forth  see  Table  5.1 ?  The  point  is  that  platforms  have  similar  affordances,  such  as  like  buttons  and  hashtags, but one should not necessarily col- lapse  them  by  treating  them  equally  across  platforms.  More  specifically,  if  one  were  to  perform  cross-platform  analysis  of  the  same  hashtags  across  multiple  platforms,  how  would  one  build  into  the  method  the  differ- ence in hashtag use in Twitter and Instagram?  Because of hashtag proliferation on Instagram,  does  one  devalue  or  otherwise  correct  for  hashtag abundance on the one platform while   valuing it steadily on another? One could strive  to identify cases of copy-and-pasting hashtag  strings, and downplay their value, certainly if  posts are being ‘stuffed’ with hashtags.  Second,  certain  platforms   and  perhaps  more  so  certain  topics  such  as  large  media  events  on  most  any  platform   may  indeed  have  user  cultures  and  automation  activity  that  routinely  befoul  posts  as  well  as  activ- ity measures. Hashtag hijacking is a case in  point,  especially  when  one  is  studying  an  event or a social issue and encounters unre- lated hashtags purposively inserted to attract  attention and traffic, such as when spammers  monitor trending hashtags and use them tac- tically to promote their wares. Hashtag junk  may distract at least the researcher.  Third,  while  a  more  complex  topic,  bots  and  the  activity  traces  they  leave  behind  are often similarly considered worth special  consideration  during  the  analysis   Marres,  2015 . From a digital forensics point of view,  bots  that  like  and  follow  may  have  specific   network   signatures,  e.g.,  they  do  not  tend  to  be  followed,  or  to  be  liked,  meaning  the  bot often only has outlinks. For the purposes  of  this  discussion,  they  may  inflate  activity  in causes and such inflation may be consid- ered  artificial   though  of  course  there  are  bots  created  for  events  and  issues,  too,  and  their  activities  are  thereby  purposive . Thus  manipulation as well as artificiality are addi- tional  intriguing  complications in both sin- gle-platform and cross-platform analysis.  Fourth,  platforms  have  ‘device  cultures’  that affect how one interprets the data from  the API.3  That  is,  all  platforms  filter  posts,  showing particular content and letting other  content slide downwards or off screen, so to  speak   Eslami  et  al.,  2015 .  Users  thereby  cannot ‘like’ all content equally. That which  is liked may tend to be liked more often, and  thus  there  may  be  power  law  and  long  tail  effects that differ per platform. But we may  not know how preferred posting affects activ- ity measures. APIs will return like and share  counts  for example  per post, but they do not  let us know the extent to which all the content    digital Methods For Cross-PlatForM analysis   101  has been equally visible to those who would  be able to like, share, comment, and so forth.  And filtering styles and thus visibility effects  differ per platform.  Above  a  series  of  questions  has  been  posed concerning the limitations of compar- ing  evaluations  of  content,  recommended  with  the  same  type  of  button  on  different  platforms, given that the platforms may have  different  user,  spamming,  bot  and  device  cultures.  How  to  nevertheless  undertake  cross- platform  analysis?  When  studying  recommendations and the content that rises,  metrically, to the top of the platforms, it may  be instructive to begin by examining briefly  which  digital  objects  are  available  in  each  of the platforms  as above and in Table 5.1   and  subsequently  enquire  into  how  domi- nant devices  or in this case metrics such as  Klout  handle these objects. Subsequently, it  is asked, how to repurpose the metrics?  cross-plaTform analysis:  co-linked, inTer-liked and  cross-hashTagged conTenT  Instagram,   Klout,  as  the  term  indicates,  measures  a  user’s  ‘clout’,  slang  for  influence,  largely  from data culled online, where the user is not  only  an  individual  but  can  be  a  magazine,  institution,  professional  sports  team,  etc.  Klout  scores  are  measured  on  the  basis  of  activity  on  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  Google+,  LinkedIn,  and  Foursquare  Rao et al., 2015 . It is an influ- ence measure that takes into account particu- lar  appearance  signals  across  the  seven  platforms   e.g.,  mentions  on  Twitter ,  and  those  mentions  by  highly  influential  user  accounts grant more influence or clout to the  user  in  question.  It  also  grounds   and  aug- ments  the online appearance measures with  ‘offline  factors’  that  take  into  account  a  user’s ‘real world influence’ from Wikipedia  as  well  as  resonance  in  news  articles   Rao  et al., 2015: 3 . Job titles, years of experience   and similar from LinkedIn are also factored  in. It is also a computationally intensive, big  data undertaking and an aggregated form of  cross-platform analysis.  If one were to learn from Klout for social  research,  one  manner  would  be  to  shift  the  focus from power  measures of increases or  decreases  in  one’s  influence   to  matters  of  concern  increases or decreases in attention,  including  that  from  significant  others   –  be  these  to  events,  disasters,  elections,  revolu- tions,  social  causes,  and  so  forth.  The  shift  in focus would be in keeping with how social  media is often currently studied, as discussed  above. That is, one could apply Klout’s gen- eral procedure for counting user appearances,  and  ask,  which  causes  are  collectively  sig- nificant  across  social  media  platforms,  and  which   key   actors,  organisations  and  other  users  are  linked  to  them,  thereby  granting  them attention. Just as importantly, the atten- tion granted to a cause by key actors, organi- sations  and  users  may  be  neither  undivided  nor  sustained.  Such  an  observation  would  invite inquiries into partial attention as well  as attention span, which together could begin  to form a means to study engagement across  social media.  When  can  so-called   info-web  meth- ods  based  on  the  hyperlink  still  be  applied  to  the  study  of  the  web  and  its  platforms?  By  ‘http  or  html  approaches’  to  web  1.0,  I  mean  software  like  the  Issuecrawler  and  other hyperlink analysis tools, which, gener- ally speaking, crawl a seed list of websites,  locate  hyperlinks  either  between  them  or  between them and beyond them, and map the  interlinkings,  showing  uni-directional,  bi- directional as well as the absence of linking  between websites  see Figure 5.3 . Problems  arise.  Through  automated  hyperlink  analy- sis,  the  researcher  may  miss  relationships  between websites which are not captured by  hyperlinks,  such  as  sites  mentioning  each  other in text without linking. One may also  miss links between websites because servers  are down, or javascript or other code impen- etrable  to  crawlers  are  employed  on  one  or     102  figure 5.3   showing individual, significant Twitter users  issuecrawler map showing Twitter.com as significant node, albeit without    Source: Issuecrawler.net, June 2014   more  websites  in  the  network.  Elmer  and  Langlois   2013   thereby  proposed  to  fol- low  keywords  across  websites  as  well  as  platforms.  As the info-web has evolved into a social  web,  hyperlink  analysis  generally  captures   links between pages or hosts on the web, but  not on social media platforms, where only the  host is returned  Facebook.com  rather than  individual user profiles, such as a Facebook  account,  page  or  group  or  an  individual  Twitter  user.

These  draw- backs have occasioned researchers to move in  two directions at once: develop crawlers and  hyperlink  analytical  machines  that  pinpoint  deep  links  between  social  media  platforms  and  websites  as  well  as  within  platforms   such as the Hyphe project4 , and to consider  new  means  to  study  relationships  between  platforms  as  well  as  between  platforms  and  the web that do not rely on hyperlinks only.  Joining  in  part  with  the  call  by  Elmer  and  Langlois  2013 , here the proposal would be  to study content across the platforms  and the  web : which content is co-linked, inter-liked  and or cross-hashtagged?  Co-linked content are URLs  often short- ened  on  social  media   that  are  linked  by  two  or  more  users,  platform  pages  or  web- pages.  Inter-liked  content  is  content  liked  by users and pages across platforms. Cross- hashtagged content is content referred to by  hashtags across platforms. As they are often  embedded  social  issues   and  events ,  the  hashtags themselves could be considered the  content.  research sTraTegies for   cross-plaTform analysis  We  might  ask,  then,  how  to  perform  cross- platform analysis, and which platforms may  be productively compared. When discussing  the kind of research done with social media,  even  with  the  shift  to  the  study  of  social  causes over the self, it is worthwhile to point  out that one may emphasise medium research,  social research, or a combination of the two.  For medium research, the question concerns  how the platform affects the content, be it its  presence or absence as well as its orderings.  Additionally,  specific  cultures  of  use  per  platform, and  strategic  transmedia deploy- ment,  may  inform  the  medium  research,  as  discussed  above.  For  social  research,  the   question concerns the story the content tells,  despite the platform effects. For a combina- tion of medium and social research, the ques- tions  are  combined;  how  does  the  platform  affect  the  availability  of  content,  and  what  stories  do  the  content  tell,  given  platform  effects? Thus for cross-platform analysis, the  following steps may be taken.  1  Choose a contemporary issue  revolution, disas- ter, election, social cause, and so forth  for cross- platform analysis. One may choose to follow an  active or unfolding issue  an issue in motion, so  to  speak ,  or  one  from  recent  history   an  issue  from the past, where overtime analysis is desir- able . Here one should consider which platforms  provide overtime data  Facebook , and which do  not without great effort  Twitter .  2  Design  a  query  strategy.  For  social  issues  and  causes,  consider  querying  for  a  program  and  an  anti-program   Rogers,  2017 .  For  exam- ple,  in  the  2015  US  Supreme  Court  ruling  for  same-sex  marriage  the  competing  Twitter  and  Instagram  hashtags  reflected  hashtag  publics  forming around a program and an anti- program,  lovewins  and  jesuswins,  If  hashtags are preferred, for an election, consider  querying  a  set  of  candidates  or  parties,  e.g.,  Trump and Hillary  perhaps together with addi- tional hashtags as well as keywords . For a dis- aster  or tragedy , consider querying its name s ,  e.g., MH17. URLs and or domain names can be  used as queries for a number of platforms.  respectively.   3  Develop an analytical strategy. For social issues  and  causes,  consider  which  program  or  anti-  program  is  finding  favour   including  among  whom  and  where .  Does  it  have  a  set  of  net- worked  publics  and  a  particular  geography?  For  an  election,  consider  creating  portrayals  of  the  candidates  via  the  associated  issues,  or  comparing  their  relative  resonance  with  cur- rent  election  polls.  For  a  revolution,  consider  its  momentum  and  durability   including  the  subjects that continue to matter and those that  do not endure . For a disaster, consider how it is   continually   remembered  or  forgotten,  and  to  which extent it has been and still is addressed  and by whom.  4  Consider  the  configuration  of  use.  It  may  be  instructive  for  the  analysis  to  look  into  how  the  platform  is  configured  and  set  up  by  the    104  initiator s . Is it a group or a page, with or with- out  moderation?  Is  it  centrally  organised  or  a   collective  effort?  Are  comments  allowed?  Does  the user have a distinctive follower strategy?  5  Cross-platform  analysis.  Undertake  the  platform  analysis, according to the query design strategy  as  well  as  the  analytical  strategy  discussed  above,  across  two  or  more  platforms.  For  each  platform  consider  engagement  measures,  such  as the sum of likes, shares, comments  Facebook ,  likes  and  retweets   Twitter   and  co-hashtags   Instagram .  Which   media   content  resonates  on  which  platforms?  Consider  which  content  is  shared across the platforms  co-linked, inter-liked  and  cross-hashtagged ,  and  which  is  distinc- tive,  thereby  enabling  both  networked  platform  content  analysis  as  well  as  medium-specific   or  platform-specific  effects.  6  Discuss  your  findings  with  respect  to  medium  research, social research or a combination of the  two. Does a particular platform tend to host as  well  as  order  content  in  ways  distinctive  from  other platforms? Are the accounts of the events  distinctively  different  per  platform  or  utterly  familiar no matter the platform?  In  practice  certain  platforms  lend  them- selves  to  comparison  more  artfully  than  others, given both the availability of objects  such  as  the  hashtag  or  geotag  as  well  as  roughly similar cultures of use. Through the  vehicle of the hashtag, Twitter and Instagram   as well as Tumblr  are often the subject of  cross-platform  analysis.  One  queries  the  APIs with such tools as TCAT  for Twitter   as  well  as  relatively  simple  Instagram  and  Tumblr  hashtag  explorers  made  available  by  the  Digital  Methods  Initiative,  creating  collections  of  tweets  and  posts  for  further  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis.  Take,  for  example,  certain  significant  events  in  the  so-called  migration  crisis  in  Europe,  one  concerning  the  death  of  refugee  chil- dren   Aylan  Kurdi  and  his  brother   and  another  the  sexual  assaults  and  rapes  on  New Year’s Eve in Cologne  Geboers et al.,  2016 . For each case Twitter and Instagram  are  queried  for  hashtags   e.g.,  aylan ,  whereupon  tweet  and  post  collections  are  made.  For  Twitter,  one  ‘recipe’  to  sort   through  the  contents  of  the  collections  would include the following:   a   Hashtag  Frequency  counts  ascertain  the  other  hashtags that co-occur, and is useful to explore  the issue space. For the Cologne rape cases, the  hashtag einearmlänge co-occurs greatly, which  was a trending topic referring to the remarks by  the  Cologne  mayor  that   as  a  solution   women  should  remain  an  arm’s  length  away  from  so- called strangers.   b   Mention Frequency lists the usernames of those  who tweet and who are mentioned so one notes  which users may dominate a space.   c   Retweet  Frequency  provides  a  ranked  list  of  retweeted tweets, showing popular or significant  content.   d   URL  Frequency  is  a  ranked  URL  list  showing  popular or significant media  such as images and  video .  The  most  referenced  media,  especially  images, become a focal point for a cross-platform  analysis with Twitter.  For  Instagram,  hashtag  frequency  is  under- taken  together  with  image  and  video  fre- quency.  One is also able to query Instagram  for geo-coordinates, which is not undertaken  here.   Ultimately,  the  means  of  comparison  are hashtag as well as image and video use,  where  the  former  suffers  somewhat  from  hashtag stuffing in Instagram.  The  question  of  platform  effects  is  treated  in  the  qualitative  analysis,  where  in  both  the  Aylan as well as the Cologne New Year’s Eve  cases the incidence of news photos was much  greater  in  Twitter  than  in  Instagram,  where  there  were  more  derivatives,  meaning  anno- tated,  photoshopped,  cartoon-like  or  other  DIY materials with  implied or explicit  user  commentary. Twitter  thereby  becomes  a  pro- fessional medium  with effects  and Instagram  more a user-generated content medium, becom- ing a particular, user-led form of news-follow- ing  platform  to  which  its  founder  has  been  aspiring. The Aylan case, however, appears to  reduce this medium-specificity, because there  is a relatively greater amount of images which  have been edited so as to come to grips with  the tragedy of the drowned toddler.   digital Methods For Cross-PlatForM analysis   105  conclusions: digiTal meThods  for cross-plaTform analysis  In the call for methodological attention to the  platformisation  of  the  web,  Elmer  and  Langlois  2013  discuss how analyses based  on the hyperlink do not embrace the analyti- cal  opportunities  afforded  by  social  media.  Hyperlink analysis, and its tools such as the  IssueCrawler,  rely  on  an  info-web   aka  web  1.0 ,  where  webmasters  make  recom- mendations by linking to another website  or  non-recommendations  through  not  making  links,  thereby  showing  lack  of  interest  or  affiliation .  Focusing  on  links  only  misses  the novel objects of web 2.0, social network- ing sites, platforms and social media  as the  social web has been called , such as the like,  share  and  tweet. While  Elmer  and  Langlois   2013  called for the analysis of the keyword  over  the  hyperlink,  but  also  perhaps  over  other social media objects, around the same  time as their publication the API had arrived   Facebook’s version 1.0 in 2010, Twitter’s in  2006 ,  and  gradually  became  the  preferred  point of access to data over scraping, which  the platforms actively sought to thwart. The  API is of course controlled by the service in  question,  be  it  Twitter,  Facebook  or  others,  and  steers  research  in  ways  more  readily  palpable perhaps than scraping, for the data  available  on  the  interface   that  could  be  scraped   and  through  the  developer’s  entry  point  may  differ  considerably.  The  ethics  turn in web research, bound up with the rise  of the social web and its publicly available,  personal data, in turn has shaped the acces- sibility of certain data on the APIs such that  Facebook  no  longer  allows  one  to  collect  friends’  ‘tastes  and  ties’,  or  likes,  profile  interests as well as friends. Such unavailabil- ity comes on the heels of a critique of a study  of the same name that collected  or scraped,  albeit  with  permission   Facebook  profiles  and friends’ data from Harvard students and  enriched it with their student housing infor- mation,  without  knowledge.  Concomitant with the decline in the study of   their   the self in social media analysis with digital  methods   given  the  increasing  dearth  of  available  data  through API  restrictions   has  been the rise in attention to events, disasters,  elections, revolutions and social causes. Not  only is it in evidence in Facebook research on   Arab  Spring   pages   and  to  an  extent  groups ,  but  also  in  Twitter   revolutions ,  where Jack Dorsey, its co-founder, signalled  the shift in the interviews in the Los Angeles  Times  in  2009,  mentioning  that  Twitter  did  well  events  such  as  disasters,  elections  as  well as conferences. Instagram, according to  its  founder  Kevin  Systrom,  would  like  to  follow the same trajectory, becoming a plat- form of substance and thereby for the study  of  events   Goel,  2015 .  The  API,  however,  appears to have shaped social media studies  beyond  its  selective  availability  of  data.  Rather, the APIs serve as silos for what I call  ‘single-platform studies’, which are reflected  in  the  available  tools  discussed.  Netvizz  is  for Facebook studies, TCAT for Twitter stud- ies,  the  Instagram  hashtag  explorer  for  Instagram, and so forth. Unlike the web 1.0  tools such as IssueCrawler, which find links  between websites and between websites and  platforms, the social web has not seen tools  developed for cross-platform analysis. Where  to begin?  The purpose here is to develop techniques  for  multiple  platform  analysis  that  bear  medium-sensitivity.  Stock  is  taken  of  the  objects that platforms share, whereupon cul- tures of use are taken into consideration. In  other words, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram  share  the  hashtag,  however  much,  on  the  one, no more than two are recommended, on  another  it  is  rarely  used  and  on  the  third  it  is used in overabundance. The cross-platform  approaches that are ultimately described rely  on hashtags for making collections of tweets   in Twitter  and posts  in Instagram , where- upon the media format  images, but also vid- eos  common to the two are compared in the  study of events. During the European refugee  crisis  of  2015–2016,  the  death  of  the  tod- dler, Aylan Kurdi, and the sexual assaults of    106  women in Cologne stand out as major  social  media  events for analysis with a quanti-quali  approach  and  a  networked  content  analysis,  which  are  forms  of  analysis  with  affinities  with computational hermeneutics.  suggesTed resources  for tool tutorials, see the DMI ‘tools walk- through’ playlist on YouTube, www.youtube. com playlist?list=PLKzQwIKtJvv9lwyYxh4 708Nqo6YC6-YH4  1   Instagram  Instagram hashtag explorer, aka Visual   Tagnet Explorer  http:  tools.digitalmethods.net Video  tutorial  for  Instagram  hashtag  explorer,  ‘Analyze  Instagram  Activity  Around  a  Hashtag  or  Location.’  Note:  since  Instagram  has  blocked  researcher  use  of  its API  in  June  2016,  one  worka- round is to locate and insert a token.  www.youtube.com watch?v=o07aUKd   Rv0g 2  Twitter  DMI-TCAT  Analysis Tool    Twitter  Capture  and   https:  github.com digitalmethods   initiative dmi-tcat wiki  Video tutorial for TCAT, ‘Overview of   Analytical Modules’  www.youtube.com watch?v=ex97   eoorUeo 3  Facebook  Tool   Netvizz   Facebook  Data  Extraction   https:  apps.facebook.com netvizz  Netvizz video tutorials: ‘Introduction to Netvizz 1.2+’ www.youtube.com watch?v=3vkKP   cN7V7Q  macro view’  istYg  ‘Downloading  data  and  producing  a   www.youtube.com watch?v=dfoYAP   4  Gephi-related  Gephi  The Open Graph Viz Software  https:  gephi.org ‘Gephi  Tutorial  for  working  with   Twitter mention networks’  www.youtube.com watch?v=snPR   8CwPld0  ‘Combine  and  Analyze  Co-Hashtag  Networks   Instagram,  Twitter,  etc.   with  Gephi’  www.youtube.com watch?v=ngqW   jgZudeE  Notes   1   There  certainly  were  social  aspects  to  the  early  web,  however  much  its  dominant  devices   Google web search, and Altavista before it  were  oriented  less  to  sociality  than  information  com- pared to online platforms of a later period.   3     2   More  specifically,  these  days  recommendations  could be said to be co-authored by the user and  the system, whereas previously they were made  by the site owner. ‘Device  culture’  studies  would  inquire  into  the  chain of interactions between user and platform  that results in data collected and system-analysed  so that ultimately content is recommended recur- sively back to the user  Rogers et al., 2013; Welte- vrede, 2016 .   4   See the Hyphe project at the MediaLab, Sciences   Po, Paris, http:  hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr .  references  Agar, John  2001 . ‘Review of James Gillies and  Robert  Cailliau,  How  the  Web  was  Born.

This  turn  pre- sents  an  unprecedented  opportunity  for  researchers who can now test social theories  using massive datasets of fine-grained, unob- trusively  collected  behavioral  data.  In  this  chapter,  we  aim  to  introduce  non-technical  readers to the promise of these computational  social  science  techniques  by  applying  three  of the most common approaches to a biblio- graphic  dataset  of  social  media  scholarship.  We use our analyses as a context for discuss- ing the benefits of each approach as well as  some of the common pitfalls and dangers of  computational approaches.  The  chapter  walks  through  the  entire  process  of  computational  analysis,  begin- ning  with  data  collection.  We  explain  how  we  gather  a  large-scale  dataset  about  social   media  research  from  the  Scopus  website’s  application programming interface. The data- set we collect contains metadata about every  article  in  the  Scopus  database  that  includes  the  term  ‘social  media’  in  its  title,  abstract,  or keywords. Using this dataset, we perform  multiple  computational  analyses.  First,  we  use  network  analysis   Wasserman  &  Faust,  1994   on  article  citation  metadata  to  under- stand the structure of references between the  articles. Second, we use topic models  Blei,  2012 ,  an  unsupervised  natural  language  processing  technique,  to  describe  the  distri- bution of topics within the sample of articles  included in our analysis. Third, we perform  statistical  prediction   James  et  al.,  2013   in  order  to  understand  what  characteristics  of  articles best predict subsequent citations. For  each analysis, we describe the method we use  in detail and discuss some of its benefits and  limitations.  Our results reveal several patterns in social  media  scholarship.  Bibliometric  network  data  reveals  disparities  in  the  degree  that    112  disciplines  cite  each  other  and  illustrates  that  marketing  and  medical  research  each  enjoy  surprisingly  large  influence.  Through  descriptive analysis and topic modeling, we  find evidence of the early influence of social  network research. When we use papers’ char- acteristics to predict which work gets cited,  we find that publication venues and linguistic  features provide the most explanatory power. In  carrying  out  our  work  in  this  chapter,  we  seek  to  exemplify  several  current  best  practices in computational research. We use  data  collected  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  expectations  of  privacy  and  access  held  by the subjects of our analysis as well as the  publishers of the data source. We also make  our  analysis  fully  reproducible  from  start  to  finish.  In  an  online  supplement,  we  pro- vide  the  full  source  code  for  all  aspects  of  this project – from the beginning of data col- lection to the creation of the figures and the  chapter text itself – as a resource for future  researchers.  collecTing and describing   daTa from The Web  A major part of computational research con- sists of obtaining data, preparing it for analy- sis,  and  generating  initial  descriptions  that  can  help  guide  subsequent  inquiry.  Social  media datasets vary in how they make it into  researchers’ hands. There are several sources  of social media data which are provided in a  form  that  is  pre-processed  and  ready  for  analysis.  For  example,  The  Stanford  Large  Network  Dataset  Collection   Leskovec  &  Krevl, 2014  contains pre-formatted and pro- cessed  data  from  a  variety  of  social  media  platforms. Typically, prepared datasets come  formatted as ‘flat files’ such as comma-sepa- rated value  CSV  tables, which many types  of statistical software and programming tools  can import directly.  More  typically,  researchers  retrieve  data  directly  from  social  media  platforms  or   other  web-based  sources.  These  ‘primary’  sources  provide  more  extensive,  dynamic,  and  up-to-date  datasets,  but  also  require  much  more  work  to  prepare  the  data  for  analysis.  Typically,  researchers  retrieve  these  data  from  social  media  sites  through  application programming interfaces  APIs .  Web sites and platforms use APIs to provide  programmers  with  limited  access  to  their  servers  and  databases.  Unfortunately, APIs  are  rarely  designed  with  research  in  mind  and  are  often  inconvenient  and  limited  for  social  scientists  as  a  result.  For  example,  Twitter’s  search  API  returns  a  small,  non- random  sample  of  tweets  by  default   what  a user might want to read , rather than all of  the tweets that match a given query  what a  researcher  building  a  sample  would  want .  In addition, APIs typically limit how much  data  they  will  provide  for  each  query  and  how many queries can be submitted within a  given time period.  APIs provide raw data in formats like XML  or  JSON,  which  are  poorly  suited  to  most  data  analysis  tasks.  As  a  result,  research- ers  must  take  the  intermediate  step  of  con- verting  data  into  more  appropriate  formats  and  structures.  Typically,  researchers  must  also  construct  measures  from  the  raw  data,  such  as  user-level  statistics   e.g.,  number  of  retweets   or  metadata   e.g.,  post  length .   A number of tools, such as NodeXL  Hansen,  Shneiderman, & Smith, 2010 , exist to make  the process of obtaining and preparing digital  trace data easier. However, off-the-shelf tools  tend to come with their own limitations and,  in  our  experience,  gathering  data  amenable  to  computational  analysis  usually  involves  some programming work. to  some   traditional  forms  of  data  collection,  obtaining  and  prepar- ing  social  media  data  has  high  initial  costs.   It frequently involves writing and debugging  custom  software,  reading  documentation  about APIs, learning new software libraries,  and  testing  datasets  for  completeness  and  accuracy.  However,  computational  methods  scale very well and gathering additional data   Compared    a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   113  often simply means expanding the date range  in a program. Contrast this with interviews,  surveys,  or  experiments,  where  recruitment  is often labor-intensive, expensive, and slow.  Such scalability, paired with the massive par- ticipation  on  many  social  media  platforms,  can  support  the  collection  of  very  large  samples.  Our Application: The Scopus  Bibliographic Database  We  used  a  series  of  Scopus  Bibliographic  Database APIs to retrieve data about all of the  publications  in  their  database  that  contained  the  phrase  ‘social  media’  in  their  abstract,  title,  or  keywords. We  used  the  Python  pro- gramming language to write custom software  to download this data. First, we wrote a pro- gram  to  query  the  Scopus  Search  API  to  retrieve a list of the articles that matched our  criteria. We stored the resulting list of 23,131  articles in a file. We used this list of articles as  input  to  a  second  program,  which  used  the  Scopus  Citations  Overview  API  to  retrieve  metadata  about  all  of  the  articles  that  cited  these 23,131 articles. Finally, we wrote a third  program  that  used  the  Scopus  Abstract  Retrieval API to download abstracts and addi- tional  metadata  about  the  original  23,131  articles. Due to rate limits and the process of  trial and error involved in writing, testing, and  debugging  these  custom  programs,  it  took  a  few weeks to obtain the complete dataset.  Like many social media APIs, the Scopus  APIs return data in JSON format. Although   not suitable for analysis without processing,  we stored this JSON data in the form it was  given  to  us.  Retaining  the  ‘raw’  data  as  it  was provided by APIs allows researchers to  construct new measures they might not have  believed were relevant in the early stages of  their  research  and  to  fix  any  bugs  that  they  find  in  their  data  processing  and  reduction  code  without  having  to  re-download  raw  data.  Once  we  obtained  the  raw  data,  we  wrote  additional  Python  scripts  to  turn  the  downloaded  JSON  files  into  CSV  tables  which could be imported into Python and R,  the programming languages we used to com- plete our analyses.  Results  The Scopus dataset contains a wide variety of  data, and many different descriptive statistics  could  speak  to  various  research  questions.  Here we present a sample of the sorts of sum- mary  data  that  computational  researchers  might explore. We begin by looking at where  social media research is produced. Table 6.1  shows  the  number  of  papers  produced  by  authors  located  in  each  of  the  six  most  fre- quently seen countries in our dataset.1 We can  immediately  see  that  the  English-language  world  produces  much  of  the  research  on  social media  which is perhaps unsurprising  given  that  our  search  term  was  in  English ,  but  that  a  large  amount  of  research  comes  from authors in China and Germany.  Next we look at the disciplines that publish  social media research. Figure 6.1 shows the   Table 6.1  Top author countries by number of social media papers Country  Number of Papers  United States United Kingdom Australia China Germany Canada  7812 1711 1096   926   787   771   114  s r e p a p   f o   r e b m u N  5000  4000  3000  2000  1000  0  Discipline  Software  Medicine  all   Library and Information Sciences  Information Systems  Human−Computer Interaction  Education  Computer Science Applications  Computer Science  all   Computer Networks and Communications  Communication  2005  2015  2010 Year  figure 6.1  social media papers published in the top ten disciplines  as categorized by  scopus , over time  number of papers containing the term ‘social  media’ over time.  The  plot  illustrates  that  the  quantity  of  published  research  on  social  media  has  increased  rapidly  over  time.  The  growth  appears to slow down more recently, but this  may be due to the speed at which the Scopus  database  imports  data  about  new  articles.  Figure  6.1  shows  the  top  ten  disciplines,  as  categorized by Scopus. We see that the field  started  off  dominated  by  computer  science  publications,  with  additional  disciplines  increasing their activity in recent years. This  story is also reflected in the top venues, listed  in  Table  6.2,  where  we  see  that  computer  science venues have published social media  research most frequently.  We then consider the impact of this set of  papers as measured by the citations they have   received.  Like  many  phenomena  in  social  systems,  citation  counts  follow  a  highly  skewed distribution with a few papers receiv- ing many citations and most papers receiving  very few.  Table 6.3 provides a list of the most cited  papers.  These  sorts  of  distributions  suggest  the  presence  of  ‘preferential  attachment’   Barabási & Albert, 1999  or ‘the “Matthew  effects”’   Merton,  1968 ,  where  success  leads to greater success.  Discussion  The summary statistics and exploratory visu- alizations  presented  above  provide  an  over- view  of  the  scope  and  trajectory  of  social  media  research.

We find evidence that com- puter  scientists  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  study of social media, but that social scien- tists,  learning  scientists,  and  medical  researchers have increasingly been referring  to  social  media  in  their  published  work.   We also find several business and marketing  papers among the most cited pieces of social  media  research  even  though  neither  these  disciplines  nor  their  journals  appear  among  the most prevalent in the dataset.  These  results  are  interesting  and  believ- able because they come from a comprehen- sive  database  of  academic  work.  In  most  social science contexts, researchers have to  sample from a population and that sampling  is often biased. For example, the people will- ing to come to a lab to participate in a study  or  take  a  phone  survey  may  have  different  attributes  from  those  unwilling  to  partici- pate.  This  makes  generalizing  to  the  entire  population  problematic.  When  using  trace  data, on the other hand, we often have data  from all members of a community, including  those who would not have chosen to partici- pate. One of the primary benefits of collect- ing data from a comprehensive resource like  Scopus  is  that  it  can  reduce  some  types  of  bias in the data collection process. For exam- ple,  we  do  not  have  backgrounds  in  educa- tion  or  medical  research;  had  we  tried  to  summarize the state of social media research   by identifying articles and journals manually,  we might have overlooked these disciplines.  That  said,  this  apparent  benefit  can  also  become a liability when we seek to general- ize  our  results  beyond  the  community  that  we  have  data  for.  The  large  N  of  big  data  studies using social media traces may make  results appear more valid, precise, or certain,  but  a  biased  sample  does  not  become  less  biased  just  because  it  is  larger   Hargittai,  2015 .  For  example,  a  sample  of  100  mil- lion Twitter users might be a worse predic- tor  of  election  results  than  a  truly  random  sample of only 1,000 likely voters because  Twitter users likely have different attributes  and opinions than the voting public. Another  risk comes from the danger that data provid- ers collect or filter data in ways that aren’t  apparent.  Researchers  should  think  care- fully about the relationship of their data to  the population they wish to study and find  ways to estimate bias empirically.  Overall, we view the ease of obtaining and  analyzing  digital  traces  as  one  of  the  most  exciting  developments  in  social  science.  Although the hurdles involved represent a real  challenge  to  many  scholars  of  social  media  today,  learning  the  technical  skills  required  to obtain online trace data is no more chal- lenging than the statistics training that is part  of  many  PhD  programs.  Below,  we  present  examples  of  a  few  computational  analyses  that can be done with this sort of data.   116  neTWork analysis  Social  network  analysis  encompasses  the  most established set of computational meth- ods  in  the  social  sciences   Wasserman  &  Faust,  1994 .  At  its  core,  network  analysis  revolves  around  a  ‘graph’  representation  of  data that tries to capture relationships  called  edges   between  discrete  objects   called  nodes .  Graphs  can  represent  any  type  of  object  and  relationship,  such  as  roads  con- necting a group of cities or shared ingredients  across a set of recipes. Graph representations  of  data,  and  the  network  analytic  methods  built  to  reason  using  these  data,  are  widely  used  across  the  social  sciences  as  well  as  other  fields,  including  physics,  genomics,  computer  science,  and  philosophy.  ‘Social  network  analysis’  constitutes  a  specialized  branch  of  network  analysis  in  which  nodes  represent people  or other social entities  and  edges  represent  social  relationships  like  friendship, interaction, or communication.  The  power  of  network  analysis  stems  from its capacity to reduce a very large and  complex dataset to a relatively simple set of  relations that possess enormous explanatory  power. For example, Hausmann et al.  2014   use network data on the presence or absence  of trading relationships between countries to  build  a  series  of  extremely  accurate  predic- tions  about  countries’  relative  wealth  and  economic  performance  over  time.  By  rea- soning  over  a  set  of  relationships  in  a  net- work,  Hausmann  and  his  colleagues  show  that details of the nature or amount of goods  exchanged  are  not  necessary  to  arrive  at  accurate economic conclusions.  Network analysis has flourished in stud- ies  of  citation  patterns  within  scholarly  literature, called ‘bibliometrics’ or ‘sciento- metrics.’  Bibliometric  scholars  have  devel- oped and applied network analytic tools for  more  than  a  half-century   Kessler,  1963;  Hood & Wilson, 2001 . As a result, biblio- metric  analysis  provides  an  obvious  jump- ing-off point for our tour of computational  methods. Because network methods reflect   a whole family of statistics, algorithms, and  applications,  we  focus  on  approaches  that  are  both  well  suited  to  bibliometric  analy- sis  and  representative  of  network  analyses  used  in  computational  social  science  more  broadly.  Our Application: Citation   Networks  Our network analysis begins by representing  citation  information  we  collected  from  the  Scopus APIs  as  a  graph.  In  our  representa- tion, each node represents a paper and each  edge  represents  a  citation.  Scopus  provides  data  on  incoming  citations  for  each  article.  Our  full  dataset  includes  35,620  incoming  citations to the 23,131 articles in Scopus with  ‘social  media’  in  their  titles,  abstracts,  or  keywords.  19,267  of  these  articles   83%   have  not  been  cited  even  once  by  another  article  in  Scopus  and  18,324   79%   do  not  cite  any  other  article  in  our  sample.  The  recent  development  of  social  media  and   the  rapid  growth  of  the  field  depicted  in  Figure 6.1 might help explain the sparseness   i.e., lack of connections  of the graph. As a  result,  and  as  is  often  the  case  in  network  analysis,  a  majority  of  our  dataset  plays  no  role  in  our  analysis  described  in  the  rest  of  this section.  Once  we  create  our  citation  graph,  there  are  many  potential  ways  to  analyze  it.  One  important  application,  common  to  biblio- metrics,  is  the  computational  identification  of communities or clusters within networks.  In  network  studies,  the  term  ‘community’  is  used  to  refer  to  groups  of  nodes  that  are  densely connected to each other but relatively  less connected to other groups. In bibliomet- ric analyses, communities can describe fields  or sub-fields of articles which cite each other,  but  are  much  less  likely  to  cite  or  be  cited  by papers in other groups. Although there are  many  statistical  approaches  to  community  detection in network science, we use a tech- nique  from  Rosvall  and  Bergstrom   2008     a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   117  that has been identified as appropriate for the  study  of  bibliometric  networks   Šubelj,  van  Eck,  &  Waltman,  2016 .  By  looking  at  the  most frequently occurring journals and pub- lication  venues  in  each  community,  we  are  able to identify and name sub-fields of social  media research as distinct communities.  A  citation  graph  is  only  one  possible  network  representation  of  the  relationships  between  articles.  For  example,  the  use  of  common  topics  or  terminology  might  con- stitute  another  type  of  edge.  Alternatively,  journals  or  individual  authors   rather  than  articles   might  constitute  an  alternative  source of nodes. In bibliometric analyses, for  example, it is common for edges to represent  ‘co-citation’  between  articles  or  authors.  Using  this  approach,  papers  are  said  to  be  tied  together  by  a  co-citation  if  they  have  both been cited in a third document  Small,  1973 . Due to limited space, we only present  the simplest case of direct citations.  Results  As  is  common  in  social  networks,  the  large  majority of articles with any citations connect  to  each  other  in  one  large  ‘“component”  or  sub-network.’  Figure  6.2  shows  a  visualiza- tion of this large component. The optimal way  to represent network data in two-dimensional  space is a topic of research and debate. Figure  6.2  uses  a  force-directed  drawing  technique   Fruchterman  &  Reingold,  1991 ,  the  most  widely  used  algorithm  in  network  visualiza- tion,  using  the  free open  source  software  package  Gephi   Bastian,  Heymann,  &  Jacomy,  2009 .  The  basic  idea  behind  the  algorithm  is  that  nodes  naturally  push  away  from each other, but are pulled together by the  edges between them. Shades in each graph in  this section reflect the communities of docu- ments  identified  by  Rosvall  and  colleagues’  ‘map’ algorithm  Rosvall & Bergstrom, 2008;  Rosvall,  Axelsson,  &  Bergstrom,  2010 .   figure 6.2  network visualization of the citation network in our dataset.

Each  of  these  communities  are  summarized  in  Table  6.4  where  the  right-most  column  lists  the  three  most  common  journals  for  the  articles  included in each community.  At this point, we could look in more depth  at  the  attributes  of  the  different  communi- ties.  For  example,  in  a  bibliometric  analy- sis  published  in  the  journal  Scientometrics,  Kovács, Looy, and Cassiman  2015  reported  summary statistics for articles in each of the  major communities identified  e.g., the aver- age number of citations  as well as qualitative  descriptions  of  the  nodes  in  each  commu- nity.  We  can  see  from  looking  at  Table  6.4  that  the  communities  point  to  the  existence  of  coherent  thematic  groups.  For  example,  Community 1 includes biomedical research,  while  Community  3  contains  papers  pub- lished  in  communication  journals.  Earlier,  we  relied  on  an  existing  category  scheme  applied  to  journals  to  create  Figure  6.1;  all  articles published in particular journals were  treated  as  being  within  one  field.  Network  analysis,  however,  can  identify  groups  and  categories of articles in terms of who is cit- ing whom and, as a result, can reveal groups  that  cross  journal  boundaries.  PLoS  ONE,    for example, is a ‘megajournal’ that publishes  articles  from  all  scientific  fields   Binfield,  2012 . As a result, PLoS ONE is one of the  most  frequently  included  journals  in  both  Community  1  and  Community  4.  In  a  jour- nal-based categorization system, articles may  be misclassified or not classified at all.  can   also   analysis   Network   reveal   details about the connections between fields.  Figure 6.3 shows a second network we have  created in which our communities are repre- sented as nodes and citations from articles in  one community to articles in the other com- munities are represented as edges. The thick- ness  of  each  edge  represents  the  number  of  citations and the graph shows the directional  strength of the relative connections between  communities.  For  example,  the  graph  sug- gests  that  the  communication  studies  com- munity   Community  3   cites  many  papers  in  information  technology  and  management   Community  2   but  that  this  relationship  is  not reciprocated.  Discussion  Like  many  computational  methods,  the  power  of  network  techniques  comes  from  representing complex relationships in simpli- fied forms.   a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   119  figure 6.3  graphical representation of citations between communities using the same  grayscale mapping described in Table 6.4. The size of the nodes reflects the total number of  papers in each community. The thickness of each edge reflects the number of outgoing   citations. edges are directional, and share the color of their source  i.e., citing  community  Although  elegant  and  powerful,  the  net- work  analysis  approach  is  inherently  reduc- tive  in  nature  and  limited  in  many  ways.  What we gain in our ability to analyze mil- lions  or  billions  of  individuals  comes  at  the  cost of speaking about particular individuals  and  sub-groups.  A  second  limitation  stems  from  the  huge  number  of  relationships  that  can be represented in graphs. A citation net- work and a co-citation network, for example,  represent  different  types  of  connections  and  these differences might lead an algorithm to  identify  different  communities.  As  a  result,  choices about the way that edges and nodes  are defined can lead to very different conclu- sions about the structure of a network or the  influence of particular nodes. Network analy- ses often treat all connections and all nodes as  similar in ways that mask important variation. Network  analysis  is  built  on  the  assump- tion  that  knowing  about  the  relationships   between  individuals  in  a  system  is  often  as  important,  and  sometimes  more  important,  than  knowing  about  the  individuals  them- selves. It inherently recognizes interdepend- ence and the importance of social structure.  This perspective comes with a cost, however.  The relational structure and interdependence  of social networks make it impossible to use  traditional  statistical  methods.  SNA  practi- tioners  have  had  to  move  to  more  complex  modeling  strategies  and  simulations  to  test  hypotheses.  TexT analysis  Social media produces an incredible amount  of  text,  and  social  media  researchers  often  analyze the content of this text. For example,  researchers  use  ethnographic  approaches    120   Kozinets, 2002  or content analysis  Chew &   Eysenbach, 2010  to study the texts of inter- actions  online.  Because  the  amount  of  text  available for analysis is far beyond the ability  of any set of researchers to analyze by hand,  scholars  increasingly  turn  to  computational  approaches. Some of these analyses are fairly  simple,  such  as  tracking  the  occurrence  of  terms related to a topic or psychological con- struct  Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010 . Others  are more complicated, using tools from natu- ral language processing  NLP . NLP includes  a  range  of  approaches  in  which  algorithms  are applied to texts, such as machine transla- tion, optical character recognition, and part- of-speech tagging. Perhaps the most common  use in the social sciences is sentiment analy- sis,  in  which  the  affect  of  a  piece  of  text  is  intuited  based  on  the  words  that  are  used   Asur  &  Huberman,  2010 .  Many  of  these  techniques have applications for social media  research.  One  natural  language  processing  tech- nique  –  topic  modeling  –  is  used  increas- ingly  often  in  computational  social  science  research.  Topic  modeling  seeks  to  identify  topics  automatically  within  a  set  of  docu- ments. In this sense, topic modeling is anal- ogous  to  content  analysis  or  other  manual  forms  of  document  coding  and  labeling.  However,  topic  models  are  a  completely  automated,  ‘unsupervised’  computational  method – i.e., topic modeling algorithms do  not require any sort of human intervention,  such as hand-coded training data or diction- aries of terms. Topic modeling scales well to  even very large datasets, and is most usefully  applied to large corpora of text where labor- intensive  methods  like  manual  coding  are  simply not an option.  When  using  the  technique,  a  researcher  begins  by  feeding  topic  modeling  software  the texts that she would like to find topics for  and by specifying the number of topics to be  returned.  There  are  multiple  algorithms  for  identifying topics, but we focus on the most  common: latent Dirichlet allocation or LDA   Blei,  Ng,  &  Jordan,  2003 .  The  nuts  and   bolts  of  how  LDA  works  are  complex  and  beyond the scope of this chapter, but the basic  goal is fairly simple: LDA identifies sets of  words that are likely to be used together and  calls these sets ‘topics.’ For example, a com- puter  science  paper  is  likely  to  use  words  like  ‘algorithm’,  ‘memory’,  and  ‘network.’  While  a  communication  article  might  also  use ‘network,’ it would be much less likely to   use ‘algorithm’ and more likely to use words  like  ‘media’  and  ‘influence.’  The  other  key  feature of LDA is that it does not treat docu- ments  as  belonging  to  only  one  topic  but  as  consisting  of  a  mixture  of  multiple  top- ics  with  different  degrees  of  emphasis.  For  example, an LDA analysis might characterize  this chapter as a mixture of computer science  and communication  among other topics .  LDA  identifies  topics  inductively  from  the observed distributions of words in docu- ments.  The  LDA  algorithm  looks  at  all  of  the  words  that  co-occur  within  a  corpus  of  documents  and  assumes  that  words  used  in   the same document are more likely to be from  the  same  topic.  The  algorithm  then  looks  across all of the documents and finds the set  of  topics  and  topic  distributions  that  would  be, in a statistical sense, most likely to pro- duce the observed documents. LDA’s output  is the set of topics: ranked lists of words likely  to  be  used  in  documents  about  each  topic,  as  well  as  the  distribution  of  topics  in  each  document. DiMaggio, Nag, and Blei  2013   argue that while many aspects of topic mod- eling are simplistic, many of the assumptions  have parallels in sociological and communi- cation theory. Perhaps more importantly, the  topics created by LDA frequently correspond  to  human  intuition  about  how  documents  should be grouped or classified.  The  results  of  topic  models  can  be  used  in  many  ways.  Our  dataset  includes  73  publications  with  the  term  ‘LDA’  in  their  abstracts.  Some  of  these  papers  use  topic  models to conduct large-scale content analy- sis, such as looking at the topics used around  health on Twitter  Prier et al., 2011; Ghosh  & Guha, 2013 . Researchers commonly use    a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   121  type   topic  modeling  for  prediction  and  machine  learning  tasks,  such  as  predicting  a  user’s  gender  or  personality   Schwartz  et al., 2013 . Papers in the dataset also use  LDA  to  predict  transitions  between  topics   Wang, Agichtein,  &  Benzi,  2012 ,  to  rec- ommend friends based on similar topic use   Pennacchiotti & Gurumurthy, 2011 , and to  identify interesting tweets on Twitter  Yang  & Rim, 2014 .  Our Application: Identifying   Topics in Social Media Research  We apply LDA to the texts of abstracts in our  dataset  in  order  to  identify  topics  in  social  media  research.  We  show  how  topics  are  extracted  and  labeled  and  then  use  data  on  topic distributions to show how the focus of  social media research has changed over time.  We begin by collecting each of the abstracts  for the papers in our sample. Scopus does not  include abstract text for 2,801 of the 23,131  articles  in  our  sample.  We  examined  a  random  sample  of  the  entries  with  missing  abstracts  by  hand,  and  found  that  abstracts  for many simply never existed  e.g., articles  published in trade journals or books . Other  articles had published abstracts, but the text  of  these  abstracts,  for  reasons  that  are  not  clear,  were  not  available  through  Scopus.2  We  proceed  with  the  20,330  articles  in  our  sample for which abstract data was available.  The  average  abstract  in  this  dataset  is   177 words long, with a max of 1,353 words  and a minimum of 5  ‘The proceedings con- tain 15 papers.’ .  We  then  remove  ‘stop  words’   common  words  like  ‘the,’  ‘of,’  etc.   and  tokenize  the  documents  by  breaking  them  into  uni- grams and bigrams  one-word and two-word  terms . We analyze the data using the Python  LatentDirichletAllocation  module  from  the  scikit-learn  library   Pedregosa,  2011 .  Choosing  the  appropriate  number  of  top- ics to be returned  typically referred to as k    is  a  matter  of  some  debate  and  research     e.g., Arun et al., 2010 . After experimenting  with different values of k, plotting the distribu- tion of topics each time in a way similar to the  graphs shown in Figure 6.4, we ultimately set  k as twelve. At higher values of k, additional  topics only rarely appeared in the abstracts.  Results  Table 6.5 shows the top words for each of the  topics discovered by the LDA model, sorted  by how common each topic is in our dataset.  At  this  point,  researchers  typically  evaluate  the  lists  of  words  for  coherence  and  give  names  to  each  of  the  topics.  For  example,  after  looking  at  the  words  associated  with  Topic 1 we gave it the name ‘Media Use.’ Of  course, many other names for this topic could  be  chosen.  We  might  call  it  ‘Facebook  research’ because it is the only topic which  includes  the  term  ‘facebook.’  Researchers  often  validate  these  names  by  looking  at  some  of  the  texts  which  score  highest  for  each  topic  and  subjectively  evaluating  the  appropriateness of the chosen name as a label  for  those  texts.  For  example,  we  examined  the abstracts of the five papers with the high- est value for the ‘Media Use’ topic and con- firmed  that  we  were  comfortable  claiming  that  they  were  examples  of  research  about  media  use.  In  this  way,  topic  modeling  requires  a  mixture  of  both  quantitative  and  qualitative interpretation. The computer pro- vides  results,  but  making  sense  of  those  results requires familiarity with the data.  The  top  panel  of  Figure  6.4  shows  how  the distribution of topics identified by LDA  in  our  analysis  has  changed  over  time.  The  LDA  algorithm  gives  each  abstract  a  prob- ability  distribution  over  each  of  the  topics,  such that it sums to 1  e.g., a given abstract  may be 80% ‘Social Network Analysis,’ 20%  ‘Education,’  and  0%  everything  else .  To  construct Figure 6.4, we sum these percent- ages  for  all  of  the  documents  published  in  each year and plot the resulting prevalence of  each topic over time.3   122  1250  1000  750  500  250  0  0.3  0.2  0.1  0.0  750  500  250  0  1000  Category  Media Use  Social Network Analysis  Consumer Analsyis  Education  Quantitative Analysis  Information Spread  Sentiment Analysis  Health  News  HCI  Influence  Methodology  i  T o p c   S u m s  i  T o p c   M e a n s  i  W e g h t e d   S u m s  2006  2008  2012  2014  2010  Year  figure 6.4  statistics from our lda analysis, over time. The top panel shows topic sums  which capture the amount that each topic is used in abstracts, by year. The middle panel  shows topic means which are the average amount that each topic is used in a given abstract.  The bottom panel shows the amount that each topic is used in abstracts, by year, weighted  by citation count  The  figures  provide  insight  into  the  his- tory and trajectory of social media research.  Looking at the top figure, it appears that the  ‘Social Network Analysis’ topic was the early  leader in publishing on social media, but was  overtaken  by  the  ‘Media  Use’  topic  around  2012.  This  pattern  is  even  more  apparent  when we look at the mean amount that each  topic  was  used  each  year   the  middle  panel  of Figure 6.4 . In the bottom panel, we take a  third look at this data by weighting the topics  used in each paper by the log of the number  of citations that the paper received. This final  statistic  characterizes  how  influential  each  topic  has  been. The  overall  story  is  similar,  although  we  see  that  the  ‘Health’  topic  and   the  ‘Media  Use’  topic  are  more  influential  than the non-weighted figures suggest.  Discussion  Some  of  the  strengths  of  topic  modeling  become  apparent  when  we  compare  these  LDA-based analyses with the distribution of  papers  by  discipline  that  we  created  earlier   Figure 6.1 . In our earlier attempt, we relied  on  the  categories  that  Scopus  provided  and  found that early interest in social media was  driven by computer science and information  systems  researchers.  Through  topic  mode- ling, we learn that these researchers engaged    a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   123  Table 6.5  Top 20 terms for each topic.

While some of our  topics  match  up  well  with  the  disciplines  identified  by  Scopus,  a  few  are  more  broad   e.g., ‘Media Use’  and most are more narrow   e.g.,  ‘Sentiment  Analysis’ .  This  analysis  provides a richer sense of the topics of inter- est to social media researchers. Finally, these  topics emerged inductively without any need  for explicit coding, such as classifying jour- nals  into  disciplines.  This  final  feature  is  a  major benefit in social media research where  text  is  rarely  categorized  for  researchers  ahead of time.  Topic  modeling  provides  an  intuitive,  approachable  way  of  doing  large-scale  text  analysis.  Its  outputs  can  be  understandable  and  theory-generating.  The  inductive  crea- tion of topics has advantages over traditional  content  analysis  or  ‘supervised’  compu- tational  methods  that  require  researchers  to  define  labels  or  categories  of  interest  ahead  of  time.  While  models  clearly  lack  the nuance and depth of understanding that  human  coders  bring  to  texts,  the  method  allows  researchers  to  analyze  datasets  at  a  scale and granularity that would take a huge  amount of resources to code manually.  There  are,  of  course,  limitations  to  topic  modeling.  Many  of  LDA’s  limitations  have  analogues  in  manual  coding.  One  we  have  already  mentioned  is  that  researchers  must  choose  the  number  of  topics  without  any  clear  rules  about  how  to  do  so. Although  a  similar problem exists in content analysis, the  merging and splitting of topics can be done  more intuitively and intentionally when using  traditional methods. An additional limitation  is that topic modeling tends to work best with  many  long  documents. This  can  represent  a  stumbling block for researchers with datasets  of short social media posts or comments; in  these cases posts can be aggregated by user  or by page to produce meaningful topics. The  scope of documents can also affect the results  of  topic  models.  If,  in  addition  to  using  abstracts  about  ‘social  media,’  we  had  also  included abstracts containing the term ‘gene   splicing,’ our twelve topics would be divided  between the two fields and each topic would  be  less  granular.  To  recover  topics  similar  to  those  we  report  here,  we  would  have  to  increase the number of topics created.  As with network analysis, a goal of LDA  is to distill large, messy, and noisy data down  to  much  simpler  representations  in  order  to  find patterns. Such simplification will always  entail  ignoring  some  part  of  what  is  going  on.  Luckily,  human  coders  and  LDA  have  complementary  advantages  and  disadvan- tages in this regard. Computational methods  do not understand which text is more or less  important.  Humans  are  good  at  seeing  the  meaning and importance of topics, but may  suffer from cognitive biases and miss out on  topics that are less salient  DiMaggio et al.,  2013 .  Topic  models  work  best  when  they  are  interpreted  by  researchers  with  a  rich  understanding of the texts and contexts under  investigation.  predicTing ciTaTion  A final computational technique is statistical  prediction. Statistical prediction can come in  handy in situations where researchers have a  great deal of data, including measures of an  important,  well-defined  outcome  they  care  about, but little in the way of prior literature  or  theory  to  guide  analysis.  Prediction   has  become  a  mainstream  computational  approach that encompasses a number of spe- cific statistical techniques, including classifi- cation, cross validation, and machine learning   also known as statistical learning  methods   Tibshirani,  1996 .  Arguably  made  most  famous by Nate Silver  2015 , who uses the  technique  to  predict  elections  and  sporting  event  outcomes,  prediction  increasingly  colors public discourse about current events   Domingos, 2015 .  There are many approaches to prediction.  We  focus  on  regression-based  prediction  because it offers a reasonably straightforward    a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   125  workflow.  Begin  by  breaking  a  dataset  into  two  random  subsets:  a  large  subset  used  as  ‘training’  data  and  a  small  subset  as  ‘hold- out’ or ‘test’ data. Next, use the training data  to  construct  a  regression  model  of  a  given  outcome   dependent  variable   that  incorpo- rates a set of features  independent variables   that might explain variations in the outcome.  Apply statistical model selection techniques  to  determine  the  best  weights   coefficients   to apply to the variables. Evaluate the perfor- mance of the model by seeing how accurately  it  can  predict  the  outcome  on  the  test  data.  After selecting an appropriate model, assess  and interpret the items that most strongly pre- dict the outcome. One can even compare the  performance of different or nested sets of fea- tures by repeating these steps with multiple  groups of independent variables.  the   Interpreting   results  of  statistical   prediction  can  be  less  clear-cut.  The  term  ‘prediction’ suggests a deep knowledge of a  complex  social  process  and  the  factors  that  determine  a  particular  outcome.  However,  statistical prediction often proves more suit- able  for  exploratory  analysis  where  causal  mechanisms and processes are poorly under- stood. We  demonstrate  this  in  the  following  example that predicts whether or not papers in  our dataset get cited during the period of data  collection.  In  particular,  we  try  to  find  out  whether textual features of the abstracts can  help explain citation outcomes. Our approach  follows  that  used  by  Mitra  and  Gilbert   2014 ,  who  sought  to  understand  what  tex- tual features of Kickstarter projects predicted  whether or not projects were funded.  Our Application: Predicting   Paper Citation  We  use  multiple  attributes  of  the  papers  in  our dataset, including text of their abstracts,  to predict citations. About 42% of the papers   9,713  out  of  23,131   received  one  or  more  citations  μ = 3; σ = 19 . Can textual features  of the abstracts explain which papers receive   citations?  What  about  other  attributes,  such  as  the  publication  venue  or  subject  area?   A prediction analysis can help evaluate these  competing alternatives.  To  begin,  we  generate  a  large  set  of  features  for  each  paper  from  the  Scopus  data. Our measures include the year, month,  and  language  of  publication  as  well  as  the  number  of  citations  each  paper  contains  to  prior  work.  We  also  include  the  modal  country  of  origin  of  the  authors  as  well  as  the affiliation of the first author. Finally, we  include the publication venue and publication   subject  area  as  provided  by  Scopus.  Then,  we  build  the  textual  features  by  taking  all  of  the  abstracts  and  moving  them  through  the  following  sequence  of  steps  similar  to  those  we  took  when  performing  LDA:  we  lowercase  all  the  words;  remove  all  stop  words; and  create uni-, bi-, and tri-grams.  We  also  apply  some  inclusion  criteria  to  both  papers  and  features. To  avoid  subject- specific jargon, we draw features only from  those  terms  that  appear  across  at  least  30  different  subject  areas.  To  avoid  spurious  results,  we  also  exclude  papers  that  fall  into  unique  categories.  Specifically,  we  remove  papers  which  are  the  only  publica- tions in a given language, journal, or subject  area. These sorts of unique cases can cause  problems  in  the  context  of  prediction  tasks  because  they  may  predict  certain  outcomes  perfectly.  As  a  result,  it  is  often  better  to  focus on datasets and measures that are less  ‘sparse’   i.e.,  characterized  by  rare,  one- off  observations .  Once  we  drop  the  8,494  papers that do not meet these criteria, we are  left with 14,126 papers.  We predict the dichotomous outcome vari- able  cited,  which  indicates  whether  a  paper  received  any  citations  during  the  period  covered  by  our  dataset   2004–2016 .  We  use  a  method  of  penalized  logistic  regres- sion  called  the  least  absolute  shrinkage  and  selection operator  also known as the Lasso    to do the prediction work. Although, the tech- nical details of Lasso models lie beyond the  scope of this chapter, it, and other penalized    126  regression models work well on data where  many  of  the  variables  have  nearly  identi- cal  values   sometimes  called  collinear  vari- ables because they would sit right around the  same line if you plotted them  and or many  zero values  this is also called ‘sparse’ data    Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2010; James  et al., 2013 . In both of these situations, some  measures  are  redundant;  the  Lasso  uses  clever math to pick which of those measures  should  go  into  your  final  model  and  which  ones should be, in effect, left out.4 The results   of a Lasso model are thus more computation- ally tractable and easier to interpret.  We  use  a  common  statistical  technique  called  cross-validation  to  validate  our  mod- els.  Cross-validation  helps  solve  another  statistical  problem  that  can  undermine  the  results of predictive analysis. Imagine fitting  an ordinary least squares regression model on  a dataset to generate a set of parameter esti- mates reflecting the relationships between a  set  of  independent  variables  and  some  out- come.  The  model  results  provide  a  set  of  weights   the  coefficients   that  represent  the  strength  of  the  relationships  between  each  predictor  and  the  outcome.  Because  of  the  way  regression  works   and  because  this  is  a  hypothetical  example  and  we  can  assume  data that does not violate the assumptions of  our model , the model weights are the best,  linear, unbiased estimators of those relation- ships.  In  other  words,  the  regression  model  fits  the  data  as  well  as  possible.  However,  nothing about fitting this one model ensures  that the same regression weights will provide  the best fit for some new data from the same  population  that  the  model  has  not  seen.  A  model may be overfit if it excellently predicts  the dataset it was fitted on but poorly predicts  new  data.  Overfitting  in  this  way  is  a  com- mon concern in statistical prediction. Cross- validation addresses this overfitting problem.  First,  the  training  data  is  split  into  equal- sized groups  typically 10 . Different model  specifications are tested by iteratively train- ing  them  on  all  but  one  of  the  groups,  and  testing how well they predict the final group.    The  specification  that  has  the  lowest  aver- age  error  is  then  used  on  the  full  training  data to estimate coefficients.5 This approach  ensures that the resulting models not only fit  the data that we have, but that they are likely  to predict the outcomes for new, unobserved  results. For each model, we report the mean  error rate from the cross-validation run which  produced the best fit.  Our  analysis  proceeds  in  multiple  stages  corresponding to the different types of meas- ures  we  use  to  predict  citation  outcomes.  We start by estimating a model that includes  only  the  features  that  correspond  to  paper  and author-level attributes  year, month, and  language of publication, modal author coun- try . We then add information about the first  author’s affiliation. Next, we include predic- tors that have more to do with research topic  and field-level variations  publication venue  and subject area . Finally, we include the tex- tual features  terms  from the abstracts.  Results  Table 6.6 summarizes the results of our pre- diction  models.  We  include  goodness-of-fit  statistics  and  prediction  error  rates  for  each  model  as  we  add  more  features.  A  ‘better’  model  will  fit  the  data  more  closely   i.e.,  it  will explain a larger percentage of the devi- ance  and produce a lower error rate. We also  include a supplementary error rate calculated  against  the  ‘holdout’  data  created  from  a  random subset of 10% of the original dataset  that was not used in any of our models. An  intuitive way to think about the error rate is  to imagine it as the percentage of unobserved  papers  for  which  the  model  will  correctly  predict  whether  or  not  it  receives  any  cita- tions. The two error rate statistics are just this  same percentage calculated on different sets  of  unobserved  papers.  Unlike  a  normal  regression analysis, we do not report or inter- pret the full battery of coefficients, standard  errors, t-statistics, or p-values. In part, we do  not report this information because the results    a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   127  Table 6.6  summary of fitted models predicting citation. The ‘model’ column describes which  features were included. The n features column shows the number of features included in the  prediction. ‘deviance’ summarizes the goodness of fit as a percentage of the total deviance  accounted for by the model. ‘cv error’  cross-validation error  reports the prediction error  rates of each model in the cross-validation procedure conducted as part of the parameter  estimation process. ‘holdout error’ shows the prediction error on a random 10% subset of   the original dataset not included in any of the model estimation procedures.

Additionally,  unlike  traditional  regression  results,  coefficient  interpretation  and  null  hypothesis  testing  with  predictive  models  remain  challenging   for  reasons  that  lie  beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter .  Instead,  we focus on interpreting the relative perfor- mance of each set of features. After we have  done this, we refer to the largest coefficients  to help add nuance to our interpretation.  The results reveal that all of the features  improve the goodness of fit, but not necessar- ily the predictive performance of the models.  As a baseline, our controls-only model has a  37% classification error on the holdout sam- ple. This level of precision barely improves  with the addition of both the author affilia- tion  and  subject  area  features.  We  observe  substantial  improvements  in  the  prediction  performance  when  the  models  include  the  publication  venue  features  and  the  abstract  text terms. When it comes to research about  social media, it appears that venue and tex- tual  content  are  the  most  informative  fea- tures  for  predicting  whether  or  not  articles  get cited.  To  understand  these  results  more  deeply,  we  explore  the  non-zero  coefficient  esti- mates for the best-fitting iteration of the full  model. Recall that the Lasso estimation pro- cedure  returns  coefficients  for  a  subset  of   the parameters that produce the best fit and  shrinks the other coefficients to zero. While  it does not make sense to interpret the coef- ficients in the same way as traditional regres- sion, the non-zero coefficients indicate what  features  the  model  identified  as  the  most  important  predictors  of  the  outcome.  First,  we note that among the 1,482 features with  non-zero  coefficients,  only  2%  are  control  measures   country,  language,  month,  and  year  of  publication .  Similarly,  3%  are  sub- ject features. In contrast, 15% are affiliation  features, 34% are venue features, and a whop- ping 44% are textual terms. Once again, we  find that publication venue and textual terms  do the most to explain which works receive  citations.  Closer  scrutiny  of  the  features  with  the  largest  coefficients  adds  further  nuance  to  this  interpretation.  Table  6.7  shows  the  ten  features with the largest coefficients in terms  of  absolute  value.  The  Lasso  model  identi- fied  these  coefficients  as  the  most  informa- tive  predictors  of  whether  or  not  papers  in  our  dataset  get  cited.  Here  we  see  that  the  majority of these most predictive features are  publication venues. The pattern holds across  the 100 features with the largest coefficients,  of which 75 are publication venues and only  two  are  textual  terms  from  the  abstracts.  In  other words, variations in publication venue  predict which work gets cited more than any  other type of feature.   128  Table 6.7  feature, variable type, and beta value for top 10 non-zero coefficients estimated  by the best fitting model with all features included. note that the outcome is coded such  that positive coefficients indicate features that positively predict the observed outcome of  interest  getting cited  while negative coefficients indicate features that negatively predict  the outcome.

Both  types  of  features  substantially  improve model fit and reduce predictive error  in  ten-fold  cross-validation  as  well  as  on  a  holdout  sub-sample  of  the  original  dataset.  However,  venue  features  appear  to  have  a  much  stronger  relationship  to  our  outcome   citation , with the vast majority of the most  influential features in the model coming from  the  venue  data   75  of  the  100  largest  coefficients .  As  we  said  at  the  outset  of  this  section,  statistical  prediction  offers  an  exploratory,  data-driven,  and  inductive  approach.  Based  on these findings, we conclude that the venue  where  research  on  social  media  gets  pub- lished better predicts whether that work gets  cited  than  the  other  features  in  our  dataset.  Textual terms used in abstracts help to explain  citation outcomes across the dataset, but the  relationship between textual terms and cita- tion  only  becomes  salient  in  the  aggregate.  On their own, hardly any of the textual terms  approach  the  predictive  power  of  the  venue  features.  Features  such  as  author  affiliation   and  paper-level  features  like  language  or  authors’  country  provide  less  explanatory  power overall.  The approach has several important limi- tations.  Most  important,  statistical  predic- tion only generates ‘predictions’ in a fairly  narrow,  statistical  sense.  Language  of  pre- diction  often  sounds  like  the  language  of  causality  and  inferring  process,  but  these  methods  do  not  guarantee  that  anything  being  studied  is  causal  or  explanatory  in  terms of mechanisms. We do not claim that  a paper’s publication venue or the phrases in  its  abstract  cause  people  to  cite  it.  Rather,  we  think  these  attributes  of  a  paper  likely  index specific qualities of an article that are  linked  to  citation  outcomes.  Just  because  something is predictive does not mean it is  deterministic or causal. We also note that the  sort of machine learning approach we dem- onstrate  here  does  not  support  the  types  of  inferences  commonly  made  with  frequen- tist  null  hypothesis  tests   the  sort  that  lead  to  p-values  and  stars  next  to  ‘significant’  variables in a regression model . Instead, the  interpretation  of  learning  models  rests  on  looking closely at model summary statistics,  objective performance metrics  such as error  rates , and qualitative exploration of model  results.   a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   129  conclusion  In this chapter, we have described computa- tional  social  scientific  analysis  of  social  media by walking through a series of exam- ple  analyses. We  began  with  the  process  of  collecting a dataset of bibliographic informa- tion  on  social  media  scholarship  using  web  APIs similar to those provided by most social  media  platforms.  We  then  subjected  this  dataset  to  three  of  the  mostly  widely  used  computational techniques: network analysis,  topic  modeling,  and  statistical  prediction.  Most  empirical  studies  would  employ  a  single,  theoretically-motivated  analytic  approach,  but  we  compromised  depth  in  order  to  illustrate  the  diversity  of  computa- tional  research  methodologies  available.   As  we  have  shown,  each  approach  has  dis- tinct strengths and limitations.  We believe our examples paint a realistic  picture  of  what  is  involved  in  typical  com- putational  social  media  research.  However,  these  analyses  remain  limited  in  scope  and  idiosyncratic  in  nature.  For  example,  there  are  popular  computational  methods  we  did  not cover in this chapter. Obvious omissions  include  other  forms  of  machine  learning,  such  as  decision  trees  and  collaborative  fil- tering  Resnick et al., 1994 , as well as sim- ulation-based techniques such as agent-based  modeling  Macy & Willer, 2002; Wilensky &  Rand, 2015 .  Despite  our  diffuse  approach,  we  report  interesting substantive findings about the his- tory  and  state  of  social  media  research. We  discovered  a  number  of  diverse  communi- ties studying social media. We used different  tools  to  identify  these  communities,  includ- ing  the  categories  provided  by  Scopus,  the  results  of  a  community  detection  algorithm  applied to the citation network, and the topics  identified  by  topic  modeling.  Each  analysis  provided a slightly different picture of social  media research. We learned that the study of  social media related to media use and medical  research is on the rise. We also learned that  social network research was influential at the   early stages of social media research but that  it is not as influential in the citation network.  All of these findings are complicated by our  final finding that subject area is not as good  a  predictor  of  whether  a  paper  will  receive  a  citation  as  the  publication  venue  and  the  terms used in the abstract.  In  the  process  of  describing  our  analy- ses, we tried to point to many of the limita- tions  of  computational  research  methods.  Although  computational  methods  and  the  promise  of  ‘big  data’  elicit  excitement,  this  hype can obscure the fact that large datasets  and fast computers do nothing to obviate the  fundamentals of high-quality social science:  researchers  must  understand  their  empirical  settings, design studies with care, operation- alize concepts in ways that are valid and hon- est,  take  steps  to  ensure  that  their  findings  generalize,  and  ask  tough  questions  about  the substantive impacts of observed relation- ships. These  tenets  extend  to  computational  research as well.  Other challenges go beyond methodologi- cal  limitations.  Researchers  working  with  passively  collected  data  generated  by  social  media  can  face  complex  issues  around  the  ethics of privacy and consent as well as the  technical and legal restrictions on automated  data  collection.  Computational  analyses  of  social media often involve datasets gathered  without the sort of active consent considered  standard  in  other  arenas  of  social  scientific  inquiry. In some cases, data is not public and  researchers  access  it  through  private  agree- ments  or  employment  arrangements  with  companies  that  own  platforms  or  proprie- tary  databases.  In  others,  researchers  obtain  social media data from public or semi-public  sources, but the individuals creating the data  may not consider their words or actions public  and may not even be aware that their partici- pation generates durable digital traces  boyd  &  Crawford,  2012 .  A  number  of  studies  have been criticized for releasing information  that researchers considered public, but which  users did not  Zimmer, 2016 . In other cases,  researchers pursuing legitimate social inquiry    130  have become the target of companies or state  prosecutors  who  selectively  seek  to  enforce  terms of service agreements or invoke broad  laws such as the federal Computer Fraud and  Abuse Act  CFAA .6  We  advise  computational  researchers  to  take  a  cautious  and  adaptive  approach  to  these  issues.  Existing  mechanisms  such  as  Institutional Review Boards and federal laws  have  been  slow  to  adjust  to  the  realities  of  online  research.  In  many  cases,  the  author- ity  and  resources  to  anticipate,  monitor,  or  police  irresponsible  behaviors  threaten  to  impose  unduly  cumbersome  restrictions.  In  other  cases,  review  boards’  policies  green- light research that seems deeply problematic.  We believe researchers must think carefully  about  the  specific  implications  of  releasing  specific  datasets.  In  particular,  we  encour- age abundant caution and public consultation  before  disseminating  anything  resembling  personal information about individual social  media  system  users.  Irresponsible  scholar- ship harms both subjects and reviewers, and  undermines the public trust scholars need to  pursue their work.  At the same time, we remain excited and  optimistic about the future of computational  studies of social media. As we have shown,  the potential benefits of computational meth- ods  are  numerous.  Trace  data  can  capture  behaviors  that  are  often  difficult  to  observe  in  labs  and  that  went  unrecorded  in  offline  interactions.  Large  datasets  allow  research- ers to measure real effects obscured by large  amounts of variation, and to make excellent  predictions  using  relatively  simple  models.  These new tools and new datasets provide a  real opportunity to advance our understand- ing of the world. Such opportunities should  not  be  undermined  by  overly-broad  laws  or  alarmist concerns.  than   Finally, much of computational social sci- ence, including this chapter, is data-focused  rather  theory-focused.  We  would  encourage others to do as we say, and not as  we  do. The  great  promise  of  computational  social  science  is  the  opportunity  to  test  and   advance  social  science  theory.  We  hope  that  readers  of  this  chapter  will  think  about  whether there are theories they are interested  in which might benefit from a computational  approach.  We  urge  readers  with  a  stronger  background  in  theory  to  consider  learning  the tools to conduct these types of analyses  and  to  collaborate  with  technically  minded  colleagues.  Reproducible Research  Computational  research  methods  also  have  the important benefit of being extraordinarily  reproducible  and  replicable   Stodden,  Guo,  &  Ma,  2013 .  Unlike  many  other  forms  of  social  research,  a  computational  researcher  can  theoretically  use  web APIs  to  collect  a  dataset  identical  to  one  used  in  a  previous  study. Even when API limits or other factors  prohibit  creating  an  identical  dataset,  researchers can work to make data available  alongside the code they use for their analysis,  allowing others to re-run the study and assess  the  results  directly.  Making  code  and  data  available also means that others can analyze  and critique it. This can create uncomfortable  situations,  but  we  feel  that  such  situations  serve  the  long-term  interests  of  society  and  scholarly integrity. Although not every com- putational  researcher  shares  their  code   Stodden et al., 2013 , there are movements  to  encourage  or  require  this   LeVeque,  Mitchell,  &  Stodden,  2012;  Stodden  et  al.,  2013; Bollen et al., 2015 .  We  have  tried  to  follow  emerging  best  practices  with  regards  to  reproducibility  in  this chapter. We have released an online copy  of all of the code that we used to create this  chapter.  By  making  our  code  available,  we  hope to make our unstated assumptions and  decisions visible. By looking at our code, you  might find errors or omissions which can be  corrected  in  subsequent  work.  By  releasing  our code and data, we also hope that others  can  learn  from  and  build  on  our  work.  For  example, a reader with access to a server and    a CoMPutational analysis oF soCial Media sCholarshiP   131  some  knowledge  of  the  Python  and  R  pro- gramming languages should be able to build  a more up-to-date version of our dataset years  from now. Another reader might create a sim- ilar  bibliographic  analysis  of  another  field.  By using our code, this reader should able to  produce results, tables, and figures like those  in  this  paper.  Data  repositories,  such  as  the  Harvard Dataverse, make storing and sharing  data  simple  and  inexpensive.  When  think- ing of the opportunities for openness, trans- parency,  and  collaboration,  we  are  inspired  by  the  potential  of  computational  research  methods for social media. We hope that our  overview, data, and code can facilitate more  of this type of work.  online supplemenTs  All of the code used to generate our dataset,  to complete our analyses, and even to produce  the text of this chapter, is available for down- load on the following public website: https:   communitydata.cc social-media-chapter   Because  the  Scopus  dataset  is  constantly  being updated and changed, reproducing the  precise  numbers  and  graphs  in  this  chapter  requires access to a copy of the dataset we col- lected  from  Scopus  in  2016.  Unfortunately,  like  many  social  media  websites,  the  terms  of use for the Scopus APIs prohibit the pub- lic re-publication of data collected from their  database. However, they did allow us to create  a private, access-controlled, replication data- set  in  the  Harvard  Dataverse  archive  at  the  following  URL:  http:  dx.doi.org 10.7910  DVN W31PH5. Upon request, we will grant  access to this dataset to any researchers inter- ested in reproducing our analyses.  Notes   1   Technically, each paper is assigned to the modal   i.e., most frequent  country among its authors.  For  example,  if  a  paper  has  three  authors  with  two authors located in Canada and one in Japan,   the modal country for the paper would be Can- ada.  Any  ties   i.e.,  if  more  than  one  country  is  tied for most frequent location among a paper’s  authors   were  broken  by  randomly  selecting  among the tied countries.   2   This provides one example of how the details of  missing data can be invisible or opaque. It is easy  to  see  how  missing  data  like  this  could  impact  research results. For example, if certain disciplines  or  topics  are  systematically  less  likely  to  include  abstracts in Scopus, we will have a skewed repre- sentation of the field.   3   More complex approaches such as dynamic LDA   Blei & Lafferty, 2006  are often better suited to  identify the temporal evolution of topics.   4   To  put  things  a  little  more  technically,  a  fitted  Lasso  model  selects  the  optimal  set  of  variables  that should have coefficient values greater than  zero  and  shrinks  the  rest  of  the  coefficients  to  zero  without  sacrificing  goodness  of  fit   Tibshi- rani, 1996 .   5   For our Lasso models, cross-validation was used  to select λ, a parameter that tells the model how  quickly to shrink variable coefficients. We include  this information for those of you who want to try  this on your own or figure out the details of our  statistical code.   6   See Sandvig’s  2016  blogpost, ‘Why I am Suing  the  Government,’  for  a  thoughtful  argument  against the incredibly vague and broad scope of  the CFAA as well as a cautionary tale for those  who write software to conduct bulk downloads  of public website data for research purposes.  references  Arun,  R.,  Suresh,  V.,  Madhavan,  C.

This  is  a  world  of  research  that  attends  primarily  to  linguistic, sociolinguistic and discursive phe- nomena  in  new social  media.  The  chapter  starts with a brief review of the field, referring  to  key  moments,  issues,  and  scholars.  With  this  done,  I  move  to  identifying  three  broad  organizing  principles  in  digital  discourse  research:  discourse,  multimodality,  ideology.  A key objective with this overview is to show  how  digital  discourse  studies  attends  to  both  micro-level  linguistic  practices  and  more  macro-level  social  processes;  by  the  same  token,  scholars  in  the  field  are  increasingly  interested  in  understanding  how  language  intersects with other modes of communication.  New social media have actually been pushing  language  scholars  to  rethink  the  foundations  and boundaries of their work. In this regard,  my chapter then turns to consider a selection  of  studies  which  exemplify  a  number  of  language-related  issues,  but  which  also  demonstrate  an  analytic  framework  for   understanding the way language takes place in  new social media as a metadiscursive resource,  a  metrolingual  resource,  a  transmodalizing  resource,  and  a  technologizing  resource.  Recognizing the fuzziness of the labels ‘new’  and ‘social’, my chapter deliberately retains a  dual  new social  focus,  not  least  because  dis- course  scholars  start  from  the  premise  that  language  is  inherently  and  unavoidably  social.  Much  of  the  research  cited  here  is  written in English and or about English, even  though the sites, topics and authors represent  a  far  more  diverse  field.  Unless  specifically  attending  to  different  ways  of  speaking  or  writing,  discourse  studies  is  principally  con- cerned  with  the  uses  of  language  in  general  rather than any particular language.  background  In the last decade there has been something  of  a  boom  in  the  broadly  defined  field  of  digital  discourse  studies  –  that  is,  scholars    136  whose  work  centers  on  the  language  of   new social media within the even wider field  of  what  is  sometimes  called  Computer  Mediated  Communication.   No  doubt  the  editors  of  this  volume  will  have,  from  the  outset, commented on the issues of labelling  and terminology that plague academia gener- ally and digital media studies in particular.   Some  of  the  best  examples  of  this  digital  discourse boom are listed below as ideas for  further reading  see p. 143 . To set the scene,  however,  I  start  here  with  little  of  the  ‘his- tory’ of the field, which is also a way for me  to start introducing some of its major organ- izing principles.  Social   Arguably  the  best  known,  internation- ally recognizable scholar of new media lan- guage is Susan Herring who, in 1996, edited  a  foundational  English-language  collection  titled  Computer-Mediated  Communication:  Linguistic,  and  Cross-Cultural  Perspectives   Herring,  1996 .  Herring  has  always  characterized  her  own  work  as  Computer  Mediated  Discourse  Analysis   or  just  CMDA;  e.g.,  Herring,  2001   and  is  someone who retains one of the best overall  perspectives on the field  see Herring, 2004,  2013, 2015; although see also Baron, 2008 .1  From  the  beginning,  Herring  helped  estab- lish  the  core  linguistic  variables  needed  for  an analysis of new media language: structure   e.g., typography, spelling, word choice, sen- tence  structure ;  meaning   i.e.,  of  symbols,  words,  utterances,  exchanges ;  interaction   e.g.,  turn-taking,  topic  development,  back- channels, repairs ; and social function  e.g.,  identity markers, humour and play, face man- agement,  conflict .  In  framing  new  media  language,  studies  should  also  attend  to  key  technological  variables   e.g.,  synchronicity,  persistence  of  transcript,  channels  of  com- munication   and  situational  variables   e.g.,  number  of  participants,  demographics,  set- ting,  purpose,  topic .  This  basic  framework  continues  to  inform  a  great  deal  of  digital  discourse  research.  Scholars  have,  however,  sought  to  push  the  field  further;  for  now,  I  shall mention just two early examples.  in   computer-mediated   Another  foundational  moment   the  field  was  the  publication  in  2006  of  a  spe- cial  issue  of  the  Journal  of  Sociolinguistics  on  communication,  edited  by  Jannis  Androutsopoulos.2  In  his  introductory  paper, Androutsopoulos   2006   offered some important pointers for deepen- ing digital discourse research; most notably,   the need to move beyond an undue empha- sis  on  the  linguistic  and  orthographic  fea- tures  of  digital  media  language,  shifting  towards more ethnographically-grounded user- related  approaches.  In  more  recent  work,  Androutsopoulos  e.g., 2010, 2011  has con- tinued to promote the value of research shaped  by this type of discourse-ethnographic rather  than variationist-sociolinguistic approach; in  other words, pushing us to pay less attention  to the formal features of new media language   i.e., what it looks like  and more attention to  the situated practices of new media language   i.e.,  what  it  does  –  or,  rather,  what  peo- ple  do  with  it . Along  much  the  same  vein,  Alexandra  Georgakopoulou   2006   offered  her own recommendations for extending the  field. These included: ensuring that the study  of  language  is  grounded  in  a  concern  for  broader sociocultural practices and inequali- ties of communities; considering the connec- tions  between  online  and  offline  practices,  and  between  different  technologies;  and  emphasizing  the  contextual,  particularistic  nature  of  new  media  language.  Once  again,  we  see  in  Georgakopoulou’s  recommenda- tions a growing preference for research that  is  more  committed  to  the  social  meanings  of technology and its particular  hence ‘par- ticularistic’   significance  for  specific  users,  groups  or  communities.  In  many  ways,  this  paradigm shift brings digital discourse analy- sis into line with similar shifts in new media  studies  more  generally.  In  a  nutshell,  what  we  see  is  digital  media  language  scholars  turning away from the purely or distinctively  ‘linguistic’ and towards a more properly dis- cursive or communicative approach. And this  brings me nicely to three organizing princi- ples at the heart of digital discourse studies   digital disCourse: loCating language in new soCial Media  137  core organizing principles  Most research on digital discourse nowadays  responds  either  directly  or  indirectly  to  the  kinds of paradigmatic issues and recommen- dations  sketched  above.  Inspired  by  these  priorities, I want now to offer three broader  organizing  principles  which  define  the  core  work of new social media language scholar- ship   Thurlow  &  Mroczek,  2011 .  For  such  an already interdisciplinary field – and in the  context  of  an  extremely  interdisciplinary  volume – these types of conceptual clarifica- tions have the added benefit of making things  a  little  more  transparent  and  hopefully  understandable.  example,  relationship,  setting,  layout,  ges- ture,  accent  and  typography.  The  second  implication  of  a  social-cultural  approach  to  language  is  a  need  to  think  also  about  its  increasing  technologization   cf.  Fairclough,  1999 . What is meant here is that we engage  also  with  the  historical-political  context  of  contemporary  language  use:  its  commodifi- cation and its recontextualized use as a life- style resource to be sold back to us, or as a  workplace  tool  used  to  manage  us   see  Cameron, 2000; Heller, 2003 . This, as Pierre  Bourdieu   1991   has  famously  discussed,  recognizes language as a mode of symbolic  power and why language is always a matter  of political economy.  Discourse  Multimodality  Putting ‘language’ in its place – and follow- ing  the  lead  of  those  scholars  already  men- tioned  –  it  is  essential  to  recognize  that  digital  discourse  is  interested  in  language  only  in  so  far  as  it  illuminates  social  and  cultural  processes   cf.  Bucholtz  &  Hall,  2008, on ‘sociocultural linguistics’ . In other  words,  the  primary  concern  is  not  with  the  abstract,  grammatical  language  of  linguis- tics,  but  rather  the  everyday  functions  and  uses of language. It is for this reason that we  tend to use the term discourse.  For excellent  introductions  to  discourse  studies,  see  Cameron  &  Panović,  2014;  Jaworski  &  Coupland,  2014 .  In  linguistically-oriented  discourse analysis there is typically a shared  commitment  to  the  following:  the  social  functions  of  language,  the  interactional  accomplishment of meaning, the significance  of communicator intent, and the relevance of  context.  This  has  two  specific  implications  for digital discourse studies. First, we recog- nize  the  inherently  mediated  nature  of  all  communication   Norris  &  Jones,  2005;  Scollon 2001  and not just in the case of so- called  computer-mediated  communication;  communication  is  always  contextualized   i.e., mediated, embodied, emplaced  by, for   Multimodality is increasingly regarded as a  core  concept  in  and  the  study  of  discourse   e.g.,  Jewitt,  2014;  Kress  &  van  Leeuwen,  2001 ,  which  means  attending  to  the  way  language interacts with – and is only made  meaningful  through  its  interaction  with  –  other  semiotic  systems.  This  is  especially  germane  given  the  growing  complexity  of  the  multi-media  formats  of  contemporary  communication, brought about by the inevi- table convergence of “old” and “new” media  and  the  layering  of  different  digital  media.  In  their  efforts  to  redress  the  previous  absence  of  linguistic  issues  in  computer- mediated  communication,  digital  discourse  scholars have sometimes overlooked the fact  that words are only ever part of the picture.  All  texts,  all  communicative  events,  are  always achieved by means of multiple semi- otic resources, even so-called text-based new  media  like  instant-  and  text-messaging.  Herein  lies  much  of  the  potential  in  new  media for invention and creativity; time and  again,  research  shows  how  users  overcome  apparent semiotic limitations, reworking and  combining – often playfully – the resources  at  their  disposal.  Well-known  scholars  of  multimodality,  Gunther  Kress  &  Theo  van    138  Leeuwen   2001:  11   use  the  bedroom  for  demonstrating the inherent multimodality of  texts as well as the ‘orchestration’ of multi- ple semiotic modes. But another useful invo- cation  of  the  bedroom  is  to  be  found  in  Rodney Jones’  2010  more literal reference  to  it  as  a  common  site  for  young  people’s  digital media practices. In either case, digital  discourse  seeks  to  understand  the  situated,  spatialized   which  is  also  to  say  mobile   experiences of new social media.  Ideology  Linguistically-oriented  discourse  studies,  especially  that  falling  under  the  rubric  of  Critical Discourse Studies, often also orients  to  the  notion  of  Foucauldian  discourses;  as  such,  it  combines  both  d-discourse  and  D-discourse   Gee,  2010 .  In  practice,  what  this means is that scholars are interested in   a   the  ways  micro-level  interactional  and  textual practices constitute our social worlds,  and  b  the ways our everyday communica- tive representational practices are structured  by  larger  systems  of  belief  and  hierarchies  of  knowledge.  In  other  words,  we  seek  to  understand  how  our  uses  of  language  feed  ideological systems, just as we want to know  how  ideologies  shape  the  way  we  use  lan- guage.  Of  course,  new social  media  are  themselves  inherently  ideological,  both  in  terms of their political-economies of access  and  control   i.e.,  some  have,  some  have  none less , but also in terms of their poten- tial  as  mechanisms  for  both  normative  and  counter-normative  representation;  they  are  used to control people, and they are used to  resist  control.  This  is  quite  apparent  when  one  thinks  of  the  symbolic  power  of  the  news and broadcast media, but no less is true  of  any  number  of  seemingly  mundane  mechanical, medical or digital technologies.  And,  coming  full  circle,  language  too  is  fully  ideological.  Online  or  offline,  spoken  or  typed,  face-to-face  or  digitally  ‘medi- ated’,  what  people  do  with  language  has   material  consequence   cf.  Foucault,  1981   and language is instrumental in establishing  categories  of  difference,  relations  of  ine- quality or, at the very least, the social norms  by which we all feel obliged to live our lives.  Whether it is done by academics, journalists,  teachers  or  ‘non-experts’,  talk  about  lan- guage  or metalanguage  always exposes the  power privilege:  competing  standards  of  ‘correct’,  ‘good’  or  ‘normal’  language;  debates  about  literacy  and  occupational  training;  and  the  social  categorization  and  disciplining  of  speakers.  And,  as  work  on  language  ideology   Woolard  &  Schieffelin,  1994   reminds  us,  talk  about  language  is  usually a matter of disciplining the bodies of  speakers  rather  than  the  niceties  of  their  speech.  These  three  organizing  principles  are  clearly  inter-related  and  they  are  presented  here  as  a  series  of  only  loosely  mapped  statements.  I  should  also  add  that  different  scholars  orient  differently  to  these  princi- ples, with some being more or less interested  in questions of multimodality and or ideol- ogy, for example. All, however, agree on the  way we think about the language – that is, as  discourse – even if we may decide to focus  on  different  aspects  of  it.  In  this  regard,  I  turn  now  to  my  proposal  for  a  four-part  framework for researching new social media  language.  analyTic frameWork  In the real-world contexts of digital discourse,  language emerges as a kind of figure-ground  illusion,  switching  into  and  out  of  focus  at  different  moments.  Sometimes  it  feels  as  if  language  is  everywhere,  other  times  it  is  nowhere; it can be high-profile and dominant  one minute, low-key and almost invisible the  next. And  this  becomes  increasingly  true  as  our technologies keep evolving and converg- ing, and, to some extent, approximating face- to-face communication with all its immediacy,    digital disCourse: loCating language in new soCial Media  139  complexity  and  variety   Which  is  certainly  not to say that face-to-face communication is  necessarily the best or highest order of human  interaction . It is also true to say that the place  of language in digital discourse is bound up  with some deep-seated mythologies about the  nature  of  language   see  language  ideologies  above   and  rooted  in  the  global  linguistic  marketplace. In other words, we must remem- ber that all ways of speaking writing are not  equal or treated as equal. With this in mind,   I  want  to  consider  the  place  of  the  English  language in digital discourse as a convenient  way  to  think  about  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  understanding  and or  studying  language in new social media.  Language as a Metadiscursive  Resource  The  language  of  digital  media  is  often  depicted in the news media and other public  venues  as  a  threat  to  the  language;  we  hear  that, for example, English is somehow being  lost  or  that  society  is  losing  its  control  of  ‘good’,  ‘proper’  or  standard  English   Tagliamonte & Denis, 2008; Thurlow 2006 .  According  to  reputable  news  sources,  new  communication technologies ‘ruin grammar’  and ‘beat up’ or ‘corrupt’ languages. And this  way of talking about digital discourse is fairly  persistent  even  in  spite  of  evidence  to  the  contrary  Tagliamonte, 2016; Thurlow, 2014 .  The  bottom  line,  of  course,  is  that  English  cannot  really  be  lost  because  it  was  techni- cally  never  ‘found’  in  the  first  place.  There  never was a neatly demarcated, unequivocally  prescribed  ‘Golden  Age  of  English’  with  a  fully  secured,  unchanging  standard.  Take  a  look  at  this  random  sample  of  international  newspaper headlines about texting:   	 Text-speak: language evolution or just laziness?  	 Problems With Teens Texting Too Much  	 Texting  more  popular  than  face-to-face    conversation   	 Are Teens Texting Away their Lives?   	 Twtr? It’s majorly bad! Leading headteacher   condemns ‘text speak’   	 Is Texting Killing the English Language?  	 Your Texting Addiction is Starting to Cost the   Government  These  headline  stories  are  all  matters  of  social  or  moral  judgement  rather  than  lin- guistic ones. It is the perception of language  threat  –  or  language  loss  –  that  is  real.  In  thinking  about  the  place  of  English  vis-à- vis new social media, therefore, what we see  here  is  language  being  taken  up  as  a  meta- discursive  resource  for  telling  a  particular  story about technology, but also about young  people.  In  other  words,  this  is  “language  about  language”  or  rather  discourse  about  discourse,  written  by  adult  journalists  for   mostly  other adults. Language is, thus, not  simply a way of communicating but a power- ful resource for representing young people –   so-called ‘digital natives’ – and a resource by  which adults may perform their own identi- ties  as  adults. As  Deborah  Cameron   1995   argues, none of this is especially new; every  generation likes to complain about the next  generation’s  communication  practices.  This  is nonetheless an important context in which  we see language taking place in and around  new social media.  Needless  to  say,  telling  an  exaggerated  story about digital discourse makes for good  news.  The  story  of  a  ‘new  language’  or  of  ‘language  threat’  sells  much  better  than  a  story about the gradual, inevitable ‘evolution’  of English or about the ways young people’s  communication  is  actually  being  enhanced  by  new social  media.  Which,  of  course,  is  precisely  what  a  lot  of  empirical  evidence  reveals. Take a look at these messages – the  first  from  the  Irish  Times   ;  see  Thurlow,  2006 ,  the  second  and  third  from  my  own  empirical  data   Thurlow,  2003;  Thurlow  &  Poff, 2013 :  In the news …   	 Mst f d tym dey usd ds knd f lng’ge 2 tlk 2 1 anthr   nt 1ly n txt bt evn   	 n wrtng ltrs 2   140  In real life …   	 Have you had a shower today as I’m sure I can   smell u from here! Teehee    	 Where r u?We r by the bar at the back on the left.  Unlike  the  kinds  of  completely  fabricated,  unrealistic  ‘examples’  that  often  appear  in  news  reports,  the  language  of  texting  and  other  digital  discourse  is  really  surprisingly  unremarkable. Regardless of their emoticons,  abbreviations and non-conventional spellings,   most messaging is far from hieroglyphic and  unintelligible. Besides, as Tim Shortis  2007   has  shown,  most  of  the  features  thought  to  typify  digital  discourse  have  long-standing  precedents in English anyway – even the sup- posedly  iconic  letter-number  homophones   gr8 .  Digital  discourse,  while  sometimes  distinctive, is often far from unique. And this  is  precisely  why  studies  of  people’s  actual  practices  are  always  needed.  English  may  well be changing but not in the ways – or to  the extent – that news-makers would have us  believe. Nor are old, conventionalized ways  of  doing  English  being  straightforwardly  or  comprehensively replaced. Besides, it is not  all about English anyway.  Language as a Metrolingual  Resource  In  digital  discourse  –  but  also  in  other   contexts – English is increasingly dislodged  and dislocated in all sorts of different ways. It  is certainly less and less the de facto language  of  new social  media  as  it  once  was.  If  any- thing typifies digital English, it is the mixing  of  registers  and  styles,  and  the  blending  of  vernacular and official ways of speaking writing.   This is why teachers are sometimes driven to  distraction by their students’ emails.  In their  large-scale  study  of  text-messaging,  for  example,  Christa  Dürscheid  and  Elisabeth  Stark  2011  amassed a compelling story of  the  multilingual  nature  of  digital  discourse.   Here is an example of one of their more strik- ing text-messages:  Olla  fratello!!!  Come  stai?  Wie  geht’s  dir  so?  Immer noch so lange am arbeiten wie früher? Ich  hab endlich mein eigenes Restaurant und mucho  travajo  aber  macht  mir  extrem  spass  …  ;-   allora  amore, buona giornata und luegsch uf di, gäll …;-   peace  Dürscheid & Stark, 2011   With four other languages being used, we see  how  English   underlined  for  clarity   figures  as  just  one  linguistic  resource.  Particularly  given  the  translocal  spaces  of  new  media,  where  speakers writers  are  often  reaching  beyond domestic spaces and national bound- aries,  digital  discourse  often  resembles  a  linguistic  ‘mash-up’   see  Leppänen  et  al.,  2009 . And these kinds of translocal, multi- lingual practices take place across a range of  new social media genres and contexts, as we  see  in  examples  from  studies  of  microblog- ging  by  Carmen  Lee   2011   in  Hong  Kong  and  by  Saija  Peuronen   2011   in  Finland   again, English references underlined .  WOW~~~WOW˜˜!!!!! 加油!!!!  Lee, 2011   Sanotaan  näin  et  kyl  voit  chilli  rullail  kaupungil. Varmaan  poljet  nopeempaa  kun  mostly  skedejät.  Mut  jos  poljet  rec reational   rullaavien  kavereiden  kaa,jäät  kyl  harmittavan  paljon  jälkeen  …  ei  nää  oo  niin  opeet  ku  perus  rullaimet.  Mut  voit  kyl  muutenki rullailla… Mut rec rullamil ET VOI grin- data … et sinäänsä temppu rullat on only do it all  skate! ☺  Peuronen, 2011   Here we have people dipping into and out of  the  global  lingua  franca,  a  language  which  may or may not be their own, at least not in  straightforward  ways.  Nor  is  it  straightfor- wardly  ‘languages’  at  play.  As  Peuronen  demonstrates, the English that is used is not  straightforwardly standard English, but rather  particular varieties and subcultural styles of  English.  Indeed,  digital  discourse  not  only  problematizes  and  challenges  our  tendency  to overdraw the notion of languages  i.e., in  practice,  languages  are  not  neatly  separated  or  always  easily  distinguishable ,  but  also    digital disCourse: loCating language in new soCial Media  141  our assumptions about the discrete nature of  language itself  see next section . It is for this  reason that digital discourse may be charac- terized by a term like metrolingualism  Otsuji  & Pennycook, 2010 , which tries to account  for  the  creative,  mix-and-match  ways  that  people  nowadays  take  up  different  ways  of  speaking  as  playful  and  transcultural  resources.  It is also worth noting that the spaces – or  cyberspaces  –  of  English  or  any  other  lan- guage are certainly no longer neatly demar- cated  or  ring-fenced.  Anyone  who  travels  will notice how ostensibly English-language  texts are now constantly interpenetrated with  the  sounds  and  voices  of  other  speakers,  other languages. Opening up the BBC News  homepage  or  my  World  Time  Buddy  page  in Bern or Buenos Aires, I am immediately  presented with a reconfigured linguistic land- scape with, for example, local advertisements  in local languages. New-media texts are often  especially and explicitly heteroglossic, com- prising  multiple  voices  and  multiple  types  of  voices   Androutsopoulos,  2010,  2011 .  By  the  same  token,  they  are  also  always  multimodal.  Language as a Multimodal  Resource  As a heavily keyboard-driven means of com- municating, digital discourse is in some ways  intensely  verbal. Yet  language  is  either  sec- ondary or marginal or altogether irrelevant to  the  kinds  of  everyday  meaning  making  that  happen  with  digital  media.  Any  Facebook  profile proves this point: they are often multi- lingual, and almost always multi-modal and  multi-media. Indeed, one of the major prob- lems with newspaper reporting about digital  discourse  is  its  noticeable  and  consistent  disregard not only for the creativity of young  people’s language use, but also for the inno- vative,  multimodal  design-work  that  often  characterize  new social  media   their   practices.  By  the  same  token,  the  problem  with many language scholars is that they tend  to single out language for isolated analysis.  Two students chatting online [starts: 12:39am] … P1:  is  that  who  you  went  to  the  passion  concert   with?  P2: YES P2: woooww P2: how did u know!?!?!?!? P1: lol you told me..? P1: how did you hear about passion anyway? P2: paul P2:  paul invited me. and i listend to passions song   on youtube  P2: and i LOVED it P1: oh haha P1: haha is he flip P2: i love acoustic guitar P2: and piano P1: i knowwwwww P2:  i have a picture with him hehe and his songs   on my ipod  The  extract  above  from  two  of  my  students  chatting online clearly does not look like an  email, a business letter, or an academic essay.   See Thurlow, 2012, for the complete extract  and full discussion.  This is not formal, writ- ten English. Nor is it meant to be. More to the  point, however, what is happening here is not  simply a matter of language per se. The sig- nificance  in both senses of the word  of this  exchange – its communicative force – lies as  much  in  the  visual  as  it  does  in  the  verbal.  That  the  two  have  ever  been  separated  for  academic purposes says much about our own  theoretical presuppositions and analytic con- veniences. Words  on  the  page  or  the  screen  have  never,  in  practice,  been  simply  verbal.  No neat boundaries exist in digital discourse  between  standard  written  English  and  ver- nacular,  spoken  English  or  between  global  English and local English, or between English  and other languages; by the same token, the  symbolic and material properties of language  can  seldom  be  separated  out.  This  is  what  Carmel  Vaisman’s   2011   research  on  the  blogging  ‘language’  of  Israeli  Fakatsa  girls  shows rather nicely  Figure 7.1 .   142  figure 7.1  Source: Vaisman  2011   In this example, the line between the use  of  language  and  the  design  of  language  is  very blurred. In recognizing and accounting  for the creative, playful uses of language in  new social media contexts, we often witness  unorthodox, experimental worlds – the kind  of language practices that, following Evelyn  Ch’ien   2004 ,  we  might  think  of  as  weird  English or, in this case, weird Hebrew.  And to   be  clear:  ‘weird’  here  is  meant  as  a  good  thing!  It is certainly the case that language  is not neatly bounded in digital discourse and  studies must always attend to – and account  properly – for the ways it intersects with and  relies on other modes of communication.  Language as a Technologizing  Resource  I  come  now  to  the  last  of  my  four  analytic  frames  for  thinking  about  the  place  of  lan- guage  in  digital  discourse.  In  this  regard,  I  want to draw attention to the ways language  and communication are commodified, instru- mentalized  and  technologized  in  new social  media contexts. In keeping with the work of  Critical  Discourse  Analysts,  therefore,  we  are obliged to consider how digital media are  used in ways to shape and control our com- municative  practices   cf.  Cameron,  2000;  Fairclough, 1999 . As a case in point, I offer  The British Monarchy Facebook profile and  the following excitable BBC News headline  from  October  2014:  ‘The  Queen  sends  her  first tweet through @BritishMonarchy’. And   the  image  accompanying  this  story?  The  British  head  of  state,  suitably  behatted  and  wearing a matching Twitter-blue coat, stands  in front of a podium with her forefinger ten- tatively outstretched towards a tablet screen –   poised to tweet!  As I have argued before, this is not social  media  as  many  of  us  might  understand  or  experience it  Thurlow, 2013 . You certainly  know something different is happening when  one  of  the  most  detached,  socially  removed  figureheads on the planet creates a Facebook  profile or sends her first tweet. In fact, digi- tal media – and especially social media – are  increasingly  used  as  tools  for  performing  access, for staging participation and interac- tion. It is in this way that we see technology  itself being taken up as a rhetorical resource.  All  of  which  is  akin  to  what  Norman  Fairclough   1989   called  synthetic  person- alization:  the  way  businesses  and  organiza- tions  address  mass  markets audiences  as  if  they were all individuals. Technology is key  to  this  process  as  we  also  see  in  automated   customer-service systems designed to manage  our interactions or in various apps offering to  help us ‘manage’ our social lives  e.g., chat- bots  or  ‘conversational  agents’  like Apple’s  Siri  or  Amtrak’s  Julie;  also  Swarm,  Tinder  and other so-called ‘social discovery apps’ .  All these are examples of how the social func- tions and meanings of language and commu- nication  are  nowadays  often  disembedded  and deployed as ‘plug-ins’ that skillfully blur  the  boundary  between  talk  and  technology.  In effect, technology is presented to us as a    digital disCourse: loCating language in new soCial Media  143  stand-in for talk. It is for this reason also, and  following  what  was  said  above  about  d-dis- course and D-discourse, that a proper under- standing of digital discourse requires that we  be  equally  concerned  with  large-scale  dis- courses   i.e.,  systems  of  power knowledge   as  we  are  with  the  linguistic  specificities  of  discourse and everyday talk or writing.  Just  as  we  find  language  and  communi- cation  moving  to  center  stage  in  our  social  and economic lives, many of our traditional,  familiar ways of knowing and using language  are being unsettled – not least due to the nature  and impact of new social media. And this is  a challenge for scholars of language and for  everyday language users alike. What I hope  to have done in this chapter is to show some  of the ways this is happening in the case of  English and English-language research. Just  as languages are less easily read as ‘authen- tic’ markers of identity and place, language  itself is not so readily located in words and  individual  texts.  Instead,  we  see  language s  being recontextualized and resemioticized in  different ways; that is, they are used outside  their normal contexts, and used for a range of  different  purposes.  Digital  discourse,  by  no  means a monolithic entity or practice itself,  also  demands  a  recognition  of  the  relative  place or importance of English and, indeed,  the relative place or importance of language  itself. Certainly, many of the people who use  English on a daily basis have moved beyond  monolingual, monolithic notions of English;  they have also moved well beyond the notion  of  monomodal  communication.  And  digital  discourse is both evidence of these changes  as well as a force that works to bring about  these changes.  furTher reading  Like all new social media research, the field  moves  quickly  and  changes  constantly.  In  addition  literature  sketched above and in addition to the studies   the  foundational   to   cited here, I recommend the following hand- book collections for a broader, more current  survey  of  digital  discourse  research:  Georgakopoulou  and  Spilioti   2015 ,  Seargeant and Tagg  2014  and Herring et al.   2013 .  Two  particularly  useful  texts  are  offered  by  Barton  and  Lee   2013   and  by  Page et al.  2014 . In addition to papers pub- lished  from  time  to  time  in  New  Media  &  Society  and  in  the  Journal  of  Computer  Mediated  Communication,  two  of  the  best  journals for finding digital discourse research  are  the  open-source  Language@Internet   edited  by  foundational  scholar  Susan  Herring  and Discourse, Context & Media.  acknoWledgemenTs  As agreed with the volume editors, this chap- ter draws closely, but succinctly, on the intro- duction  to  my  co-edited  volume  Digital  Discourse:  Language  and  New  Media   Thurlow  &  Mroczek,  2011   and  combines  material from another recent piece published  in Spanish  Thurlow, 2018 .  Notes   1     2    In  his  Language  and  the  Internet,  David  Crystal   2006  offers a very accessible summary of some  core linguistic issues, drawing on a wide range of  other people’s research. In  the  European  context  at  least,  scholars  like  Jannis  Androutsopoulos  are  pivotal  in  connect- ing  English-language  research  with  research  being  done  in  other  languages,  and  vice  versa.  Much  the  same  role  is  played  by  someone  like  Ana Deumert  2014  who, while writing through  English,  is  also  a  rare  example  of  a  prominent  scholar  engaging  new social  media  beyond  the  usual  North-American European  contexts.  In  this regard, the work of people like Carmen Lee    e.g.,  2011   and  Yukiko  Nishimura   e.g.,  2011   has  been  key  in  extending  our  understanding  of  East  Asian  contexts.  The  fact  remains,  how- ever, that digital discourse research continues to  be driven by English-language publications with  relatively little coverage of Latin America, Africa,  Eastern Europe and South South-East Asia.   144  references  Androutsopoulos, J.  2006 .

The  ontology  of  social  media  might  seem  wholly  unproblematic:  social  media sites are certainly infrastructures with  considerable, even massive, presence in our  lives,  the  focus  of  our  everyday  habits  of  checking and updating, circulating and shar- ing.  When  1.5  billion  people  are  active  monthly  users  of  one  leading  social  media  platform alone  Facebook , then the ‘object’ of  study  is  hardly  trivial.  But  what  type  of  object are we studying exactly? Again from  one  point  of  view,  the  question  seems  straightforward: Facebook, Twitter, and other  sites  of  social  media  activity  are  platforms   Gillespie,  2010 ,  where  social  activity  is  supported  generally  by  commercial  opera- tions.1  The  facts  of  such  platforms  –  their  design  and  other  features  –  are  important.  But in this chapter we want to go beyond the  platform  ‘surface’  and  ask  a  different   ontological  question:  what  are  social  media  from a sociological point of view? Or, more  precisely,  in  what  sense  are  ‘social  media’  actually ‘social’, as opposed to merely being  outputs  labelled  as  ‘social’?  And,  running  behind  that  question,  how  should  we  inter- pret the related epistemological claims, made  by  various  actors  every  day,  that  ‘social  media’  provide  evidence  of  ‘the  social’?  Those  questions,  it  turns  out,  are  far  from  straightforward, yet we cannot advance far in  the study of social media without answering  them. The answers will shape why we would  want to spend our time studying social media  at all rather than some other object.  Let  us  right  away  state  the  hypothesis  of  this  chapter.  Interaction  in  social  media  is  organized along highly stylized activity cor- ridors   e.g.,  sharing,  tagging,  liking   that  essentially  serve  the  purpose  of  transform- ing  online  forms  of  user  participation  into  a  computable  and  ultimately  tradable  data  footprint. By these means, each user action is  rendered a discrete data-token, a measurable    ontology  147  click.  Discrete  data-tokens  are  then  aggre- gated and several scores of user-choice affin- ities  and  relations  are  ceaselessly  computed  and  fed  back  to  users,  thus  establishing  a  dynamic context of interaction between user  choice and sociality online. As a result, what  happens on social media platforms cannot be  regarded as unproblematic evidence of social  activity per se.  Specifically, the spaces of social media are  different from those of general social analy- sis. All social spaces, not just public spaces,  have  until  now  been  analysed  on  the  basis  that they are ‘spaces of appearances’  using  Arendt’s  1960  familiar term in a more gen- eral sense . We have assumed until now that  ‘appearance’  in  such  spaces  –  presence-to- others,  availability  for  interaction  with  and  evaluation  by  others  in  that  space  –  can  be  taken  as  a  basic  datum  of  social  analysis.  But this is no longer unproblematic, because  ‘appearance’  is  now  the  result  of  prior   computer-based calculations and, worse, the  result  of  calculations  driven  by  a  particular  kind of economic motivation through which  data from online forms of sociality are traded  in a complex ecosystem of advertisers, data  brokers and other interested stakeholders. Put  simply, there is on social media platforms no  ‘appearance-in-itself’ but only ever appear- ance that is the derivative of prior processes  of  calculation.  The  result  is  a  challenge  to  the  very  basis  of  understanding  the  social:  is Twitter, for example, best understood as a  real  space  of  social  appearances,  as  we  are  tempted to see it, or rather a complex projec- tion of intersecting calculative forces? If the  latter, how should we treat Twitter and other  platforms from a sociological point of view? By  asking  these  questions,  we  follow  Jose  van  Dijck’s  scepticism  about  the  term  ‘social  media’,  insisting  instead  that  the  term ‘social’ is a site of contestation, aimed  at  the  production  of  value.  Rather  than  talk  of an age of social media, Van Dijck  2013   insists we talk of a ‘culture of connectivity’,  that is, of an industry-inflected imperative to  connect  on  particular  platforms,  in  order  to   generate  specific  types  of  value. This  chap- ter  builds  on  Van  Dijck’s  approach,  and  is  ordered  as  follows.  First,  we  briefly  review  and distinguish between the main approaches  to studying social media that have been taken  in  the  scholarly  literature.  We  argue  that  existing approaches need to be supplemented  by a critical phenomenological approach that  explores the contested status of social media  platforms  in  social  experience.  Second,  we  ground  this  proposed  critical  approach  in  a  discussion of the broad sociological nature of  data operations as they occur in social media.  Third,  we  discuss  those  data  operations  in  greater  detail,  drawing  out  the  problems  they raise for any treatment of social media  platforms  as  ‘real’  spaces  of  social  interac- tion. Fourth, we consider the implications of  our argument for the methodology of study- ing  social  media  as  an  object  within  wider  social  experience.  We  follow  this  with  a   brief conclusion.  exisTing approaches To   social media  There is no space here for a comprehensive  review  of  the  literature  on  social  media.  Instead,  we  aim,  more  modestly,  to  mark  some  distinctions  between  how  various  scholars  have  studied  the  ‘object’  of  social  media.  The  boundaries  we  draw  are  not  exclusive,  but  they  do,  we  suggest,  indicate  some  important  differences  of  emphasis  in  the existing literature.  The  first  important  approach  understands  social media as sites  where  social  networks  are produced and sometimes generated  boyd  and Ellison, 2008: 211 . This made particular  sense when, in the late 2000s and from diverse  origins,  the  scale  of  social  media  platforms  grew  fast,  and  one  of  their  most  distinctive  features was to provide the facilities whereby  people  built  and or  sustained  networks  of  friends and connections on an unprecedented  scale. Some analyses focused in greater detail    148  on the workings of this networking process,  and its potential use as a source of social cap- ital  Ellison et al., 2007; Ellison et al., 2011 ,  suggesting a positive benefit for some types of  users at least  Steinfeld et al., 20009 . Other  analyses sought to consider more broadly the  consequence  of  such  networking  on  wider  social space, arguing that, under many condi- tions, the result was to foster the emergence  of  ‘networked  publics’   boyd,  2011 :  ‘one  way of interpreting the public articulation of  connections on social networks is to see it as  the articulation of a public’  boyd, 2011: 44 .  Note  that  boyd  carefully  does  not  rule  out  other uses; indeed a major strength of boyd’s  work is to be open to the multiple and mul- tilevelled uses of social media  boyd, 2014 .  In  another  well-known  essay,  boyd   2008   analysed  the  meaning  of  the  opportunities  provided  by  social  media  platforms  for  US  youth who are generally excluded from hav- ing voice in public space: ‘they [go on social  media]  because  they  seek  access  to  adult  society. Their  participation  is  deeply  rooted  in  their  desire  to  engage  publicly’   2008:  137 . boyd links explicitly to Arendt’s  1960   concept of the ‘sphere of appearances’. Such  approaches  do  not  disguise  the  constructed  nature of social media platforms, and the dif- ficulty of treating ‘data’ from one site as soci- ologically  equivalent  to  ‘data’  from  another   boyd, 2011; boyd and Crawford, 2012 , and  this scepticism is important to our argument.  Nonetheless it  is  difficult  to  develop  such a  research agenda, while bracketing off entirely  the  term  ‘social’:  as  some  of  these  authors  note in passing, ‘social network sites provide  rich  sources  of  naturalistic  behavioral  data’   boyd and Ellison, 2008: 220, added empha- sis ,  and  ‘networked  technologies  introduce  new  affordances  for  amplifying,  recording,  and  spreading  information  and  social  acts’   boyd, 2011: 45, added emphasis . The ques- tion arises therefore how what we might call  this ‘social realist’ approach to social media  platforms can be combined with a more thor- oughgoing scepticism about the ‘social’ pro- duced there?  The  second  approach  to  social  media  platforms  puts  a  primary  emphasis  on  cri- tique, but from a distinctive angle: this is the  Marxist political economy approach champi- oned by Christian Fuchs  2014 . While this  critique focuses on many points, its key argu- ment is that social media are sites for unpaid  labour   Fuchs,  2013   through  which  new  forms of economic value are being generated  as  part  of  capitalism’s  continuing  struggle  to reproduce itself. On this account, the data  aspects  of  social  media  platform  operations  are highlighted, and criticized as an aspect of  a  wider  appropriation  of  social  energies  for  economic  ends.  A  strength  of  this  analysis  is to acknowledge in broad terms how social  media  both  ‘enable  and  constrain  a  social  level  of  human  societies’  through  a  ‘recur- sive organic relation between the technologi- cal and the social level of the media’  Fuchs,  2014:  37 .  This  analysis  is  grounded  in  a  broader  social  theory,  and  is  highly  critical  of  how  some  accounts  of  social  media  and  their consequences  such as Castells’ theory  of  ‘network  society’:  Castells,  2009   have  become  detached  from  social  theory  itself   Fuchs,  2014:  Chapter  4 . There  is  force  to  these  arguments,  and  one  of  us  has  devel- oped  parallel  arguments  in  other  contexts   Couldry,  2012:  Chapter  5;  2014 .  A  limit,  however,  of  Fuchs’  approach  is  that,  when  it  anticipates  the  possible  future  of  social  media, it is in terms of an unleashing of the  social  energies  seen  within  social  media:  ‘social  media  anticipate  a  full  sociality  of  human existence, but in their corporate form  this  potential  is  limited  by  capitalist  struc- tures of ownership and capital accumulation’   Fuchs, 2014: 256 . What is lost here is the  possibility that the ‘social’ that is supposedly  available  to  be  unleashed  has  already  been  shaped by the operations of those platforms  themselves.  A  third  approach  developed  particularly   in  sociological  treatments  foregrounds  the  possibility that the everyday use and embed- ding  of  social  media  platforms  is  ushering   in  a  transformation  of  both  economy  and    ontology  149  society:  a  transition  from  a  ‘linkage  econ- omy’  to  a  ‘like  economy’  where  users  now  gain social currency from the public articula- tion of connections on social networking sites   Gerlitz  and  Helmond,  2014 .  Interestingly,  one writer in this approach criticized the first  approach for too much scepticism about the  ontology  of  ‘friends’  on  Facebook   Beer,  2008  520 .  Other  work  has  discussed  the  implications  of  social  media  for  our  sense  of  social  time   Kaun  and  Stierstedt,  2014;  Weltevrede et al., 2014 . Given the intensity   of  and pressures towards  self-reproduction   on social networking sites, there is clear scope  to link such analysis to broader Foucauldian  accounts  of  how  subjects  are  produced  in  late  modernity   Marwick,  2013 .  But  what  remains difficult in this approach is to clarify  the  reference-point  from  which  this  trans- formed ‘social’ is being analysed. If the social  endlessly  reproduces  itself  in  ever-changing  ways,  how  is  critique  possible,  given  that  it  must  be  developed  from  somewhere   where  exactly?  inside the social?  This  is  where  we  find  a  fourth  approach  particularly  helpful.  This  approach  tries  to  get  into  view  the  whole  process  of  social  transformation  through  social  media  plat- forms,  not  as  a  ‘done  deal’,  but  rather  as  a  quite specific new inflection on, and appro- priation of, the sorts of activities that broadly  were once called ‘social’ in another very dif- ferent,  pre-platform  context   Mejias,  2013;  Van  Dijck,  2013 .  Jose Van  Dijck’s  critique  of  social  media,  for  example,  radically  extends  the  work  of  cultural  studies  in  an  intertextual  analysis  of  platform  discourses  and interfaces. From this analysis, Van Dijck  develops  an  overall  diagnosis  that  we  have  moved  to  a  ‘platformed  sociality’   2013:  5   which  is  not  equivalent  to  our  ‘social’,  but  can,  and  must,  be  singled  out  for  critical  analysis.  This  fourth  approach  in  our  view  goes  furthest  towards  developing  a  critical  ontology of social media. In its sceptical dis- tance from current uses of the term ‘social’  in relation to social media platforms’ activi- ties,  it  comes  close  to  philosopher  Giorgio   Agamben’s  insight  that  the  answer  to  our   current involvement in what ‘the apparatus’   by  which  he  means  our  devices  of  techno- logically  mediated  connection   cannot  be  a  simple  acceptance  or  rejection,  but  must  rather be ‘the liberation of that which remains  captured … by means of apparatuses, in order  to  bring  it  back  to  a  possible  common  life’   Agamben, 2009: 17 . That possible common  life  is  not  already  ‘there’,  visible  and  wait- ing to be released; it will have to be recon- structed from within the constrained context  of  today’s  platformed  practices.  However,  a  self-acknowledged limitation of Van Dijck’s  critique  is  that  it  does  not  encompass  the  views and accounts of users of social media. Emerging from all these critical approaches  to  social  media  is  the  prospect  of  a  critical  phenomenology of social media, which takes  distance from social media’s appropriation of  ‘the social’, while also tracing the experience  of being connected through social media and  its  material  conditions.  This  is  what  we  try  to  develop  in  this  rest  of  this  chapter.  First,  however, we need to review some fundamen- tal points about the sociology of data.  daTa  The  interface  which  social  media  platforms  present to a particular user is an array com- posed  of  various  streams  of  content  and  activity-tokens; that array is not a display of  everything  and  anything  relevant  to  that  user’s  use  of  that  platform,  but  a  particular  composed selection produced on the basis of  the  platform’s  own  criteria  of  importance   Van Dijck, 2013 . Those criteria are shaped,  above  all,  by  the  economic  drivers  of  the  platform.  All  activities  shown  on  a  social  media  platform  must,  to  be  shown  at  all,  either originate in, or be translated into, ‘for- malized inscriptions’  Van Dijck, 2013: 6  in  the format acceptable to that platform. Once  in  that  format,  they  are  treated  by  the  plat- form in accordance with its own dynamics of    150  selection,  that  is,  in  terms  of  the  ‘value’  which that particular inscription has. As Van  Dijck  puts  it:  ‘through  social  media,  …  casual  speech  acts  [of  everyday  life]  have  turned  into  formalized  inscriptions  which,  once  embedded  in  the  larger  economy  of  wider  publics,  take  on  a  different  value’   2013: 6–7 .  This  transvaluation  of  everyday  sociality  may be blurred by platforms themselves who  may be relaxed about blurring how long pre- existing friendships are equated with ‘friend- ships’ of previously unknown people formed  only  on  the  platform,  as  Van  Dijck  notes   2013:  13 .  This  blurring  is  not  the  result  of platforms’ muddy thinking, let alone any  mischief  on  their  part,  but  follows  simply  from the more general principles about how  their  data  are  procured  and  ordered.  Let  us  explore these briefly.  The  database  has  a  distinctive  type  of  power  which  Bowker  defines  as  ‘jussive’:  an ordering power based on an ‘exclusionary  principle’ that determines what can and can- not  be  stored  in  a  particular  form   Bowker,  2008  12 .  The  consequences  of  database  operations  are  in  this  sense  final:  ‘what  is  not classified gets rendered invisible’  2008  153 . Again, that is not  or at least not nec- essarily  the result of a prejudicial desire to  exclude  certain  social  entities,  but  simply  the  result  of  how  databases  must  operate  to  function effectively. The point of the exclu- sions on which databases operate is to fix the   starting-point  from  which  data  operations   counting,  aggregating,  sorting,  evaluation   begin.  In  that  sense,  by  being  placed  in  a  database,  ‘data’  become  ‘unmoored’  from  the underlying detailed materials from which  they were gathered  Kitchin, 2014: 72 . The  ‘knowledge’  that  results  cannot  easily  be  separated  out  from  the  purposive  selections  that formed the database. Indeed, as Bowker  notes, this is a feature of all archived social  memory:  ‘our  memory  practices  [are]  the  site  where  ideology  and  knowledge  fuse’   2008 228 . This, then, is the first key point  about the ontology of social media: that what   appears as ‘just having happened’ to, and for,  us on a social media platform  an apparently  natural  social  ‘datum’   can  only  appear  as  such by virtue of its place in archives ordered  according  to  principles  quite  different  from  those of everyday face-to-face social interac- tion  Alaimo and Kallinikos, 2016 .  This  might  seem  strange,  but  only  if  we  forget  that  on  social  media  platforms  ‘appearances’ are always the result of prior  processing.  There  must  always  be,  there- fore,  as  legal  scholar  Julie  Cohen  notes,  a  gap between the abstractions inherent to data  functions – their ‘processes of … representa- tion and classification’ – and the experiential  processes in which those functions become,  through  platforms,  embedded   Cohen,  2012: 24, 20 . This gap is not accidental, or  optional, but inherent to the type of appear- ance that ‘platformed sociality’  Van Dijck,  2013: 5  provides.  As a result, the basic level of symmetry we  take for granted in face-to-face social inter- action cannot be assumed. This crucial point  needs  more  explanation.  When  two  native  speakers  of  a  language  speak  together,  one  speaks in the language in which s he expects  her his  interlocutor  to  respond,  and  so  does  the  interlocutor,  and  from  this  follow  many  other  more  detailed  symmetries  of  expecta- tion and interpretation. The ‘flow’ of every- day  conversation  between  those  who  share  a language is based on two key assumptions  that  the  great  phenomenological  sociologist  Alfred  Schutz  called  ‘interchangeability  of  standpoints’  and  ‘congruence  of  relevance  systems’   Schutz  and  Luckmann,  1973:  60 . In this way, the components in a stream  of  social  interaction  are  treated  by  those  involved as continuous with each other. But  that  symmetrical  to-and-fro  cannot  be  so  easily  assumed  on  social  media  platforms,  where  whatever  can  appear  ‘back’  to  us  must always already have complied with the  external  relevance-criteria  of  the  platform,  not  those  of  the  interlocutors.  In  short-term  exchanges,  we  might  not  notice  any  differ- ence:  our  stream  of  interaction  might  seem    ontology  151  to  be  frictionless  and  unimpeded,  but  on  a  larger  scale  the  results  may  well  be  more  misleading. We will discuss this in detail in  the next section. As a result, there is a deeper  asymmetry  hidden  within  claims  that  data  from social media platforms yield knowledge  about the social. As Jose van Dijck puts it, ‘it  is easier to encode sociality into algorithms  than  to  decode  algorithms  back  into  social  action’   2013:  172 ,  and  yet  this  is  exactly  what we try to do, when we read social media  datastreams as if they were simply an exten- sion of our natural forms of sociality.  The  pressures  to  treat  what  occurs  on  social  media  platforms  as  if  they  were  the  unmediated  outcome  of  social  interaction  are  indeed  great.  This  too  derives  from  the  basic features of data processing understood  as  processes  of  categorization.  Categories  have been an important topic in social theory  for more than a century. For Durkheim and  Mauss  1969 [1902] , categories  as outputs  of  a  system  of  classification  in  so-called  ‘primitive  societies’   were  derivatives  of  the  actual  divisions  of  society  itself,  and  of  the  very  idea  of  society  itself.  In  most  sub- sequent  accounts,  the  order  of  causality  is  reversed, with categories contributing to ‘the  built  information  environment  of  a  society’   Bowker and Star, 1999: 5 .  Categories do not just operate in isolation.  They need to be held in place, as the anthro- pologist Mary Douglas pointed out, by pro- cesses  of  ‘naturalization’   Douglas,  1986 .  However  automated  the  operation  of  pro- cesses of categorizing, they also have wider  effects as social actors react to them and to  the implicit claims that the use of categories  make  about  the  way  the  underlying  world   is – that it exists in a form that enables it to  be categorized in such a way. As Bowker and  Star put it, every classificatory system ‘rep- resents the world “out there”’  1999: 61  in  a particular and decisive way. Yet it may take  time for objects, in everyday practice, to fit  with the categories that are available for them  in  a  particular  community  of  interpretation,  and  so,  Bowker  and  Star  suggest,  ‘objects   exist [as members of categories] with respect  to  a  community  along  a  trajectory  of  natu- ralization’  1999: 299, added emphasis : that  trajectory  derives  in  part  from  the  interac- tive nature of social categorization  Hacking,  1999 . Over time, the processes of categoriz- ing objects and using objects come together  in  a  process  of  ‘convergence’:  ‘the  mutual  constitution  of  a  person  or  object  and  their  representation. People put things into catego- ries  and  learn  from  those  categories  how  to  behave’  Bowker and Star, 1999: 311 .  The  relation  between  categories  and  the  objects they categorize becomes more com- plex  when  categorization  is  automated,  as  with  social  media  platforms,  and  must  be  inferred  to  operate  ‘behind  the  surface’  of  a  platform,  but  there  is  no  reason  to  expect  anything  other  than  naturalization.  What  one  of  us  has  called  the  ‘computed  social- ity’  of  social  media  platforms   Alaimo  and  Kallinikos,  2016;  Kallinikos  and  Tempini,  2014   therefore  tends,  over  time,  to  appear  natural. Research on social media has started  to  integrate  the  effects  of  this  category-  naturalization in its analysis, for example, of  how we choose ‘friends’ in platforms such as  Facebook  Bucher, 2012 .  This  can  be  understood  finally  also  as  a  process  of  spatial  organization.  As  Kitchin  and  Dodge   2011   analyse  extensively  in  their book Code Space, many spaces  physi- cal,  organizational,  informational   are  now  ‘coded’,  that  is,  their  operations  are  struc- tured  through  the  software  that  processes  data inputs of various sorts. The highly con- trolled space of the airport security queue is  one clear example, entry into which is impos- sible without having met various data-related  conditions  in  a  prescribed  sequence   2011:  Chapter  7 .  But  the  same  is  true,  even  if  less dramatically, with the ‘spaces’ of social  media platforms. Social media platforms feel  like ‘spaces’ where we can encounter others,  but  there  would  be  no  such  spaces  without  the underlying operation of the platform soft- ware and its calculative infrastructure: those  spaces  are  ‘calculative  publics’   Gillespie,    152  2014:  188–191   whose  encounters  depend  entirely  on  the  precondition  of  data-sorting,  and  whose  ‘space  of  appearances’  derives  from  calculation.  As  a  result,  platforms  organized around the category ‘friends’ are in  no sense places for encountering friends nat- uralistically: rather, as Taina Bucher argues,  ‘friends  have  become  a  primary  means  through which the production and occlusion  of information can be programmed’  Bucher,  2012:  49 .  How  can  we  think  further  about  the implications of this for social media plat- forms as ‘social objects’, and for our under- standing of sociality itself?  anaTomy of social media2  Two  fundamental  ideas  emerge  from  what  we  have  been  claiming  so  far.  First,  user  involvement and interaction on social media  is  heavily  premised  on  the  kind  of  institu- tional  entities  that  social  media  platforms  are. Access and use of social media function- alities on the part of users is embedded in a  complex  institutional  matrix  of  relations,  marked by the commercialization and trading  of user activity and its data footprint. In other  words,  the  patterns  of  interaction  and  the  sociality  that  social  media  platforms  afford  are  closely  linked  with  the  objectives  of  social  media  qua  institutional   market   actors. Second, the premises of social inter- action  on  social  media  platforms,  and  the  consequent  trading  of  its  data  footprint,  are  significantly  shaped  by  the  computational  rendition  of  the  operations  of  social  media   Kallinikos,  2009   and  the  ways  in  which  pervasive computational technologies, such as  the database, function. As with most market-  embedded exchanges, the pursuit of the com- mercial objectives of social media companies  requires quantitative description and calcula- tion. In an environment of large and shifting  data volumes, these critical tasks can only be  accomplished  by  the  heavy  involvement  of  computational  technologies  that  provide   generic  and  specific  solutions  to  the  data- handling  challenges  that  social  media  con- front.  Computational  technologies,  in  turn,  boost commercialization by affording, as we  will  see  below,  the  multiple  and  contingent  segmentation of the social qua data.  With  few  exceptions   e.g.,  Bucher,  2012;  Gillespie, 2014; Van Dijck, 2013 , these data- based  operations  supporting  social  media  have  tended  to  remain  out  of  the  limelight.  For a variety of reasons, the social implica- tions of the computational make-up of social  media have been blackboxed. It seems to us  important  to  submit  to  critical  analysis  the  entanglement of institutional and technological  forces at work here. This requires tracing the  involvement  of  the  backend  data-handling  techniques in the operations of framing, map- ping and segmenting the social that character- ize social media. The first step in this analysis  is the recognition of the fundamental fact that  the transposition of social relations on social  media  platforms  presupposes,  as  already  indicated, the drastic simplification of social  activities and their typification or categoriza- tion.  Social  activity  on  social  media  has  to  be thus simplified and shaped so as the cat- egorization  and  coding  of  social  interaction  delivers,  reliably  and  systematically,  stand- ardized  data-tokens  that  can  be  used  as  the  basis for further operations of measurement  and computation.  It  is  vital,  always,  to  keep  in  mind  the  simple fact that on social media social inter- action  needs  to  be  ‘trans-substantiated’  or  ‘trans-valuated’  into  data. There  is  no  other  way  that  social  media  can  operate.  In  some  fundamental  ways,  therefore,  social  media  are  nothing  but  data  entities.  It  is  the  data  footprint  of  social  interaction  that  provides  the material for most calculative and marker  operations  performed  by  social  media.  The  datafication  of  interaction  is  accomplished  through  the  construction  of  narrow,  heavily  stylized,  activity  types   e.g.,  liking,  shar- ing, tagging  that code user activity into data  that can be recorded in distinct fields, and so  indexed, counted, aggregated and computed.    ontology  153  Much data on social media is made of behav- ioural  data  of  this  sort,  through  which  user  activities are recorded as singular choices via  clicking  on  specific  activity  types   Alaimo  and Kallinikos, 2016, 2017 . User-generated  content that may matter more to some spe- cific  groups  of  users  makes  at  present  a  less  calculable body of data and is, for that  reason, less often recycled in the calculative  operations that define social media as institu- tional actors and organizations. Quantitative  text analysis of unstructured, user-generated,  content is of course possible and is used for  certain purposes  e.g., sentiment analysis and  marketing , but the bulk of operational data  on social media is the outcome of recording  single behavioural choices as orchestrated by  the  social  media  platforms  themselves.  The  spine of social media operations is made of  the  collection  and  analysis  of  such  behav- ioural  data,  not  of  user-generated  content   Alaimo, 2014 .  Left on its own, however, the data footprint  of social interaction on social media procured  by  these  means   simplification,  categoriza- tion  and  coding   is  not  illuminating.  As  in  most contexts where large data volumes are  involved,  data  ‘speak’  only  after  they  have  been clustered, compared and analysed. It is  the very detection of relationships between a  user  and  other  users,  between  one  group  of  users and other groups, between past and pre- sent choices, whether of individual users or  groups, that serves as the cognitive currency  of  social  media.  But  the  detection  of  such  relationships  requires  that  user  choices  qua  clicks  have  been  clustered  and  aggregated.  Data aggregation is an essential operation of  social media. The profile of the activities that  users perform on social media and the con- nections they maintain with items and other  users  result  from  aggregating  user  choices  qua  clicks  within  and  across  activity  types   liking, sharing, tagging, following, etc. . In  this sense, on social media, users for practi- cal purposes are not real persons but abstract  operations  enacted  through  the  aggrega- tion  of  singular  data-points   Alaimo  and   Kalinikos,  2016,  2017 .  On  Facebook,  for  instance,  a  user  is  defined  by,  and  is  essen- tial coterminous with, the aggregation of his  or her likes on the basis of which he or she  can be rendered as one entity comparable to  others.  On  Last.fm  or  Spotify,  a  user  is  for  most purposes defined by the aggregation of  listening  data   that  is,  clicks  on  tracks   and  tagging  data.  The  activity  types  of  social  media essentially split the unity of a person  into  well-defined  acts  and  then  reassemble  it through the data aggregation that the per- formance of such acts delivers. Placed in this  context,  aggregation  establishes  new  data  entities  through  which  the  social  fabric  is   re-established   Kallinikos,  2009   as  an   apparent   relationship  between  individual  users and groups of users, clustered and com- pared at various levels of abstraction or gen- erality  Desrosières, 1998 .  The  result  is  a  new  and  far-reaching  pli- ability  of  social  interaction  on  social  media  platforms, which constitutes a new ontology  of  the  social,  or  at  least  of  what  passes  for  ‘the  social’.  Novel  ways  of  making  social- ity visible online are established as the data  on  platform  social  interaction  can  be  sorted  in  a  variety  of  ways  that  construct  relation- ships and patterns between users and items.  Abstractions  of  this  sort  and  the  numeri- cal  data  they  deliver  have,  of  course,  been  inherent  in  many  contexts  and  institutions  of  modernity   Cohen,  1982;  Porter,  1996 .  States,  markets  and  corporations  have  for  a  long  time  based  their  operations  on  large  volumes of recombinant data, descriptive of  carefully  defined  activities   e.g.,  expendi- tures, life styles  or people  e.g., consumers,  tax payers  at individual and aggregate levels   Desrosières,  1998;  Gandy,  1993;  Hacking,  1990;  Rose  and  Miller,  2013 .  Placed  in  this larger context, the ontology of aggrega- tion and the status of aggregated entities  as  real or nominal  have always been objects of  dispute  and  controversy   Desrosières,  1998;  Espeland and Sauder, 2007; Foucault, 1970 .  However, what is at stake today in the analysis  of the ontology of social media goes further.   154  As earlier indicated, many of the natural- ized categories that have served as the basis  of  institutional  data  collection  in  the  past  have  been  embedded  in  established  social  practices and, perhaps one can claim, in real- life contexts: the operations of class distinc- tion   Bourdieu,  1984 ,  medical  professions  and systems  Bowker and Star, 1999 , other  ritualized  cultural  orders   Douglas,  1986 ,  practices  and  cultural  conventions   Rosch,  1999; Rosch and Mervis, 1975 . The relation  of social media platforms’ data collection to  wider social reality is very different. Social  media aggregate activity-tokens  user clicks   that  encode  narrowly  defined  activity-types   e.g., liking, tagging, following  whose basis  in  social  interaction,  as  normally  experi- enced and interpreted, is thin. None of these  activity-types  springs  directly  from  experi- ences  of  social  conventions.  While  aiming  at  mapping  the  trivial  and  everyday,  social  media go a considerable way towards insti- tuting   Bourdieu,  1991   an  artificial  every- day that aims at delivering the data needed  by  social  media  platforms  as  market  enti- ties for counting, indexing and recombining  what  passes  as  ‘the  social’.  This  artificial  everyday,  constituted  through  the  regular  measurement  and  aggregation  of  its  data  footprint,  is  a  defining  attribute  of  social  media,  and  indeed  of  the  very  ontology  of  the  social  that  social  media  bring  to  being   Alaimo and Kallinikos, 2017 .  This is only the beginning of a wider trans- formation.  Aggregation  further  ‘unmoors’  data  from  the  artificial  platform-contexts  in  which  it  has  originally  been  produced,  and  establishes  the  cognitive  base  upon  which individuals and other data entities are  made  commensurable   through  clicks  being  treated  as  equivalent   and  thus  comparable  and  measurable  along  various  dimensions   Espeland  and  Stevens,  1998 .  Once  aggre- gated,  individual  user-choices   e.g,  liking,  following,  tagging   can  be  sorted  and  rec- omputed in a variety of ways. A user can be  compared  with  other  users  at  various  levels  of  generality  and  patterning:  like-minded   or similar users, similar or popular items or  popular  users  generated.  For  instance,  last. fm,  a  social  media  platform  dedicated  to  music  discovery,  assembles  categories  of  similar artists based on the number of tracks  on  which  users  click.  The  listening  activity  of  users  becomes  the  means  through  which  artists can be grouped as more or less similar  depending  on  the  number  of  users  they  are  counted to have in common; the more users  they have in common, the more similar they  are, and vice versa. These patterns of similar- ity  can  draw  on  aggregate  data  over  longer  or  shorter  periods  and  various  permutations  performed over artists and periods, tracks and  users  geographical area, age or gender  that  underlie the so-called personal recommenda- tions so characteristic of social media.3  The  pattern-extraction  which  such  data  permutations  produce  serves  to  establish  a  range  of  revenue-generating  services  all  the way from marketing of specific items to  credit-scoring. The business models through  which this happens differ, but the underlying  idea  is  to  sell  the  data-patterns  thus  estab- lished  to  market  actors.  But  it  is  also  true  that  the  extraction  of  these  patterns  serves  as  the  basis  for  boosting  platform  activity  by  being  carried  over  to  users  in  the  form  of  personal  recommendations  of  various  kinds  that  platforms  assemble  and  which,  on the top of any market purpose they may  serve, incite further user action. It is impor- tant to underscore the critical nature of this  last  operation  and  the  significance  which  a  steady  inflow  of  data  plays  in  sustaining  social media. Without a mass inflow of data   i.e., user activity and clicking  that is con- stantly produced and reworked in real time,  the  artificial  reality  that  social  media  plat- forms  have  established  risks  losing  touch  with  the  institutional  and  market  purposes  that it is meant to serve  Kallinikos, 2007 .  The  extraction  of  data-based  patterns  fur- thermore  provides  a  picture  of  platform  activity that can be the basis for improving  platform  functioning  through  the  offer  of  novel functionalities to users.   ontology  155  users and reacTiviTy   and poWer  How are users to be thought in the account of  social media we have given above, the dimen- sion that we noted even Van Dijck’s critical  perspective  neglected?  Even  though  the  terms on the basis of which users join social  media  platforms  are  heavily  shaped  by  the  conditions outlined above, it is still reasona- ble to assume that personal, social and demo- graphic factors play a significant role on how  people react to these terms  e.g., boyd, 2008,  2014 .  The  study  of  particular  groups  or  communities  of  users  might  therefore  be  a  much-needed complement to the picture we  have  painted  in  the  preceding  pages.  Facets  of the reality of social media platforms and  the  experiences  they  mediate  are  without  doubt  a  local  accomplishment  that  must  be  understood  with  reference  to  specific  types  of users and groups and their pursuits.  At the same time it is important to distin- guish the different levels of reality to which  one’s arguments apply. The claims we have  advanced  in  this  chapter  aim  at  unravelling  the  complex  working  machine  that  social  media as institutional entities embody. Such  a  task,  we  admit,  cannot  be  exhausted  by  the study of particular groups and the ways  they  receive,  interpret  or  work  around  the  structuring machine of social media. At any  rate,  the  study  of  particular  groups  or  com- munities  of  users  cannot  be  meaningfully  conducted  without  reference  to  the  com- plex  interplay  between  user  groups  and  the  structuring  modalities  of  social  media,  and  the  ways  in  which  social  groups  and  social  media  as  institutional  entities  accommodate  one another. It is important to trace the dis- tinct  ways  that  groups  of  users  or  commu- nities relate to, enact and are shaped by the  structuring  premises  of  social  media  plat- forms.  Whether  conceived  as  constraints  or  affordances, the technological and economic  forces that define social media as institutional  actors cannot be wished away.  In  the  account  of  social  media  offered  in  this  chapter,  user  activity  is  an  essential  component of the apparatus of social media  and so are the preferences and differences of  users. Both user activity as a data-producing  force  and  user-preferences   and  absences  of  preferences   as  a  representation   in  data  form   of  the  social  fabric  are  brought  to  a  much  higher  level  of  abstraction  or  gener- ality and shaped in ways that accommodate  the  objectives  of  social  media  platforms  as  institutional actors. In this context, the activ- ity profiles of users and groups of users are  captured  by  constantly  placing  them  within  a  web  of  differences  and  similarities  with  other  users  or  groups  of  users,  in  the  same  way  perhaps  that  market  forces  regularly  trade  use  for  exchange  value.  It  is  this  play  of  similarity  and  difference  worked  out  at  aggregate  levels,  and  technically  known  as  network analysis, that confers the social and  market  relevance  of  social  media. As  social  media  platforms  expand  and  become  active  forces in contemporary societies, the highly  selective  and  largely  artificial  ways   lik- ing,  tagging,  following,  sharing,  posting   by  which  they  orchestrate  human  activity  become habitual and begin to congeal into a  sort of self-evident or naturalized sociality. It  is a critical research task to understand how  these  conditions  interact  with  an  alternative  sociality  that  still  has  its  roots  in  the  tradi- tional contexts of everyday life  Alaimo and  Kallinikos, 2017 .  Beyond the effects of habituation, it is criti- cal to investigate the social implications of the  personal  recommendations  and  other  com- parisons  that  social  media  advance  to  users  through the complex and largely invisible data  machinery  analysed  above.  The  interactive  and  reactive  status  of  this  process  has  been  repeatedly observed in other contexts of social  life in conjunction with people’s tendency to  enact the distinctions and classifications that  institutions  impose  on  them   see,  for  exam- ple,  Espeland  and  Sauder,  2007;  Espeland  and  Stevens,  1998;  Hacking,  1986,  1999 .    156  Espeland and Sauder  2007: 6  define reactiv- ity as ‘individuals [that] alter their behavior in  reaction to being evaluated, observed or meas- ured’,  a  conspicuously  Foucauldian  theme.  The force of this reactive and self-reinforcing  process  is  usually  strongly  correlated  with   the social embedment and solidification of the  institutional matrix within which it takes place   Foucault,  1977,  1988;  Hacking,  1999 .  In  other words, the stronger the institutions and  the relations they build with one another, the  deeper and more persisting the effects which  the  distinctions  and  classifications  they  pro- duce  have  on  people,  either  directly  through  the  provision  of  incentives  for  conforming  to  them  or  indirectly  through  mechanisms  of  enforcement  and  the  construction  of  nor- mative  and  legal  orders.  Even  though  social  media may still be thought as thin institutions,  and  the  measurements  they  produce  lack- ing  strong  normative  foundation,  the  growth  and economic success they have acquired in  barely  more  than  a  decade  provide  evidence  of  the  importance  of  the  institutional  matrix   digital technologies, market entities, revenue  generation   in  which  they  are  embedded.  This matrix, without doubt, has social power  of  a  sort,  a  power  that  fits  well  with  Pierre  Bourdieu’s  definition  of  symbolic  power  as  a ‘power of constructing reality’  1991: 166 .  conclusion  Several  implications  for  the  ontology  of  social media follow from our analysis. First,  social media do not in fact map a social real- ity ‘out there’. Rather, social media establish  a  kind  of  social  reality  by  providing  the  means through which real persons qua users  perform  activities  of  very  particular  kinds  that have largely been incited by social media  platforms themselves. In other words, making  media platforms ‘social’ in principle implies  rendering sociality ‘technical’, as Van Dijck   2013: 12  has cogently claimed.  Second,  what  is  recreated  by  these  pro- cesses of social media is, overall, an ephem- eral,  real-time  attuned,  and  perpetually  changing ‘everyday’ that reorders the trivial  pursuits and habits of individuals into groups,  categories or profiles that can be used as the  basis  for  generating  revenues.  These  cogni- tive  groupings  or  categories  differ  essen- tially  from  the  categories  established  by  conceptual  means   taxonomies   and  practi- cal purposes in everyday life between social  actors  whose  pursuits  are  not  mediated  by  data  processing.  The  cognitive  clusters  that  social media deliver are contingent outcomes  with  little  lasting  value  and  significance.  They  are  established,  as  it  were,  only  to  be  shattered,  and  reassembled  again  into  new  configurations   Lévi-Strauss,  1962 ,4  as  the  massive daily clicking of user crowds stead- ily reframes their value and market relevance   Kallinikos, 2007 .  into   Third,  what  is  thus  accomplished  takes,  from the perspective of the collective under- standing  of  the  social,  the  form  of  a  long  analytical retreat, whereby the units of social  action  are  disaggregated  into  discrete,  sin- gular  and  often  artificial  acts  that  are  then  computationally  reassembled  larger  social entities such as users, groups of users  and short-term trends. This long trajectory of  analytic reduction and – even we might say,  pulverization  –  of  the  social  is  driven  not   by  a  collective  attempt  to  understand  our  ways  of  living  together,  but  by  the  compu- tational  capacities  and  constraints  of  cur- rent computing technologies, and the overall  commercial  context  within  which  social  media platforms operate. It also reflects the  asymmetrical capabilities and powers on the  basis of which the ‘game’ that social media  platforms embody has been established and  performed.  We  need  therefore  to  move  beyond  the  study  of  particular  groups  of  social  media  platform users, towards understanding social  media as formations and institutional matri- ces  that  have  larger  effects  on  social  life.    ontology  157  The ‘big picture’ in which social media are  embedded cannot be exhausted by the study  of particular groups or settings. It cannot be  assembled unless one moves beyond the user  interface  and  lays  open  the  structuring  and  enduring  effects  which  the  entire  apparatus  of social media has on social life itself. Such  a task is replete with empirical difficulties of  varying complexity. On the one hand, access  to empirical contexts in which economic suc- cess is built and revenues earned is not eas- ily  granted.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  the  perennial  challenge  of  how  to  demarcate  meaningfully  and  study  empirically  digital  infrastructures and ecosystems in which large  numbers  of  actors,  technologies   bound- ary technologies in particular, such as APIs,  SDKs and social buttons  and processes are  connected.  Whatever  the  challenges,  it  is  important  to  pursue  research  that  is  able  to  bring  forward  the  logics  by  which  social  media platforms operate and the technologies  and systems they deploy to shape the terms  of  user  platform  participation.  Such  a  task  requires prolonged immersion into particular  research contexts  i.e., intensive case studies   that may provide the opportunity to unravel  the  design  choices,  technological  systems  and  economic  rationalities  of  social  media  platforms  Alaimo, 2014; Bucher, 2012 . It is  at this level that the evasive sociality of social  media  can  begin  to  be  pinned  down,  build- ing on the various critical literatures on social  media  platforms  discussed  in  the  chapter’s  first main section  see, for example, Alaimo  and  Kallinikos,  2017 . And  it  is  against  the  background of analysis at this level that the  projects of social actors who want to contest  the power of this ‘evasive sociality’ and pro- pose  another  one  can,  in  turn,  be  explored   Couldry and Powell, 2014 .  There  is  a  deeper  problem  too:  how  can  we  design  research  to  track  the  lineaments  of an ongoing reshaping of the social as it is  happening,  and  through  the  inevitably  local  and  particular  streams  of  social  interaction  to which as researchers we have access? The  beginnings  of  the  answer,  at  least,  lie,  we   suggest,  in  targeting  in  our  research  design  the search for the elements of social interac- tion that precisely carry traces of the longer  term: the patterns of action and categoriza- tion observable over time within a group of  actors in a platform setting and acknowledged  by those actors where we have access to them  through  interviews,  observations  or  other  means;  reflections  of  actors  of  how  across  a range of platforms certain types of action  are  incentivized  and  others  disincentivized,  and how this evaluative patterning relates to  their own broader sense of value and priori- ties; and, given how fast historically a social  media  ‘habitus’  has  emerged,  those  actors’  memories of actions they now do which seem  to crowd out those that they once did. Each  of  these  would  be  good  starting-points,  we  suggest, for beginning to trace the logics of  social  media   Van  Dijck  and  Poell,  2013   in action. But the task is a large one, and it  is  impossible  to  see  beyond  its  beginnings  at  this  point.  Nonetheless,  the  fundamental  ideas  we  have  put  forward  in  this  chapter  provide, we hope, some encouragement and  guidance along the route towards opening up  this new terrain for social inquiry.  Notes   2     1   The  Chinese  microblogging  platform  Weibo  being an important example of a hybrid market  state platform. Jannis  Kallinikos  wishes  to  acknowledge  the  contribution  of  Cristina  Alaimo  to  developing  the  ideas  that  are  presented  from  this  section  onwards.  Much  of  what  is  presented  here  has  come  about  as  the  result  of  our  joint  and  pro- tracted effort to understand the operational log- ics  and  technical  conditions  that  sustain  social  media  while  retaining  the  focus  on  social  pro- cesses and institutions.   3   This  is  accomplished  by  the  technology  of  rec- ommender  systems  by  which  affinities  between  users  or  items  are  produced  and  personal  rec- ommendations  advanced.  Amazon.com  recom- mender  system,  which  traces  similarities  and  differences  between  transactions  of  users  and  advances  recommendations  of  the  type  ‘those  that  bought  this  item  bought  that  item  too’,  is  a typical example. Such technologies, known as    158  Collaborative  Filtering  Recommender  Systems,  are widely used in social media.   4   This phrase is very similar to an epigraph of Franz  Boas  that  Lévi-Stauss   1962   uses  to  open  his  great book on mythical classifications La pensée  sauvage  The savage mind : ‘It would seem that  mythological worlds have been built up, only to  be  shattered  again,  and  new  worlds  were  built  from the fragments’.  references  Agamben,  G.   2009   What  is  an  Apparatus?

Some  have  referred  to  this  rapid  increase  as  social  media’s  ‘visual  turn’   Gibbs  et  al.,  2015:  258 .  This  visual  turn  involves the popularisation of image-centric  platforms  such  as  Instagram  and  Snapchat,  as well as the circulation of images on other,  less predominantly visual social media plat- forms  and  messaging  apps,  like  Facebook  and Twitter, WhatsApp and WeChat. Despite  this  growth  in  image  sharing,  academic  research in this area has not yet developed to  the same extent and depth as has research on  text-based  social  media  communication.2  The  research  literature  on  social  media  images has been slowly developing over the   last decade, particularly during the last few  years. Significant early research has focused  on Flickr  Van House, 2007; Burgess, 2009;  Garduno  Freeman,  2010;  van  Dijk,  2010 ,  while more recent work has looked at the use  of  images  on  Twitter   Hjorth  and  Burgess,  2014; Vis et al., 2014; Thelwall et al., 2016   and  Instagram   Alper,  2015;  Borges-Rey,  2015;  Gibbs  et  al.,  2015;  Kohn,  2015;  Manovich,  2015,  2016;  Highfield  and  Leaver,  2016;  Tifentale  and  Manovich,  2016 . Other recent work has examined par- ticular types of image, such as selfies  Senft  and Baym, 2015  and memes  Milner, 2013,  2016;  Noony  and  Portwood-Stacer,  2014;  Shifman, 2014 .  The  empirical  aspects  of  this  work  have  ranged from the analysis of large datasets to  more  qualitative  interpretations  of  specific  images.  As  in  any  field  of  research,  differ- ent approaches have particular strengths and  limitations.  Computational  methods  have  been  used  to  analyse  large  sets  of  images,  working  with  metadata,  such  as  timestamps    analysing soCial Media iMages  161  and geo-location. Such approaches have also  been used to identify patterns within sets of  images in terms of brightness, colour and hue   Hochman  and  Schwartz,  2012;  Hochman  and  Manovich,  2013a,  2013b   as  well  as  to  identify  objects  or  actions  depicted  within  images   Delaitre,  Laptev  and  Sivic,  2010 .  Such  large-scale  data  analysis  can  identify  patterns  within  sets  of  images,  or  map  the  networks  through  which  images  are  distrib- uted, but does not usually address the specific  visual content and meaning of such images.  Content  analysis,  which  categorises  images  according to specific aspects of their content  has been used by other researchers to exam- ine  more  nuanced  patterns  within  sets  of  images, but usually on a smaller scale  Seo,  2014;  Vis  et  al.,  2014;  Kharroub  and  Bas,  2015; Thelwall et al., 2016 . Yet it is gener- ally  through  close  interpretative  work  with  small datasets that a sense of the richly inter- textual meanings of images can be gained.  The  analysis  of  social  media  images  also  presents challenges specific to the visual that  are  absent  from  research  on  written  texts.  Hence  Highfield  and  Leaver’s  observation  that such work ‘requires more individual inter- vention  and  interpretation  than  samples  of  140-characters’  Highfield and Leaver, 2016:  48 .  Although  many  social  media  images  appear  to  be  used  conversationally   Gibbs  et  al.,  2015:  264; Thelwall  et  al.,  2016 ,  the  images  themselves  do  not  necessarily  ‘say’  anything in the sense that words do. This does  not mean that social media images cannot be  analysed at a large scale without consideration  of  their  socio-cultural  contexts,  but  it  means  that  images  are  difficult  to  address  quantita- tively in ways that are sensitive to the specifi- cities and functions of their pictorial forms.  Given the variety of existing visual methods  and theories, deriving from art history, photo  theory,  visual  culture  studies,  visual  sociol- ogy  and  anthropology,  it  is  challenging  to  decide whether and how existing visual meth- ods and theories can be adapted to the con- text of social media. Considerable theoretical  and empirical work has been done on digital   photography   Rubenstein  and  Sluis,  2008;  Gómez  Cruz  and  Meyer,  2012;  Moschovi,  McKay and Plouviez, 2013; Lister, 2013  and  on cameraphone practices  Van House et al.,  2005;  Van  House  and  Ames,  2006;  Gye,  2007; van Dijck, 2008; Villi and Stocchetti,  2011; Villi, 2015 . Further research examines  the  dynamic  relationships  between  camera- phone use and locative media  Hjorth, 2014;  Hjorth  and  Pink,  2014 .  Such  scholarship  can  help  us  understand  the  specificities  of  online  digital  photography,  and  how  people  use cameraphones as an important aspect of  their everyday lives. Yet it does not necessar- ily help researchers with the question of how  to approach the interpretation of these shared  images as examples of visual communication. In  the  remainder  of  this  chapter,  we  dis- cuss three approaches to the analysis of social  media  images  by  reviewing  recent  research  projects  by  the  Software  Studies  Initiative  that  involved  the  collection  and  analysis  of  relatively large datasets, projects that involved  working with images at different scales, and  qualitative  studies  of  memes  relating  to  the  Occupy Wall Street  OWS  movement in late  2011. We focus on specific work on Instagram  and Twitter as well as on selfies and memes  to  further  explore  the  strengths  and  limita- tions of these different approaches. The aim  is not to prioritise one kind of approach over  another,  but  rather  to  explore  their  advan- tages  and  limitations.  The  chapter  will  then  discuss  our  own  work  on  images  circulated  in  response  to  the  death  of  the  Syrian  refu- gee  boy  Alan  Kurdi   initially  misidentified  as  ‘Aylan’   in  early  September  2015,  as  an  example of the kinds of approaches to visual  social media that we advocate.  surveying The field  Large-Scale Image Analysis  Several  projects  have  focused  on  the  large- scale collection and analysis of social media    162  image-related  data.  The  Phototrails  and  Selfiecity  projects,  developed  by  Lev  Manovich and the Software Studies Initiative,  are  prominent  examples.  Phototrails  began  in 2011 and used 2,353,017 Instagram images  uploaded in 13 cities3 during specific periods  of  time.  The  primary  period  of  data  collec- tion began in early 2011 and ended in April  2012,  though  further  data  was  collected  for  particular  cities  during  specific  periods,  for  example  during  Hurricane  Sandy  in  New  York  in  November  2012. This  extraction  of  city-specific data was based on the geospatial  coordinates and time stamps of photographs  taken on Instagram  Hochman and Manovich,  2013: 7 . Images from the city-specific data- sets  were  arrayed  as  visualisations  on  the  project  website   phototrails.net   to  reveal  what the project team described as the ‘visual  signatures’  and  ‘rhythms’  of  these  cities   Hochman  and  Manovich,  2013:  10,  16 .  This  identification  of  ‘signatures’  and  ‘rhythms’  involved  the  mapping  of  spatial  and  temporal  patterns  among  the  images  as  well  as  patterns  relating  to  colour  and  hue.  For example, the 23,581 images uploaded in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  during  24  hours  of  Hurricane  Sandy  between  29  and  30  November 2012, were visualised in the form  of a semi-circular ‘radial plot’. This involved  positioning the images at different points in  relation  to  the  circumference  of  the  semi- circle, depending on the time they were taken  within  the  24-hour  period,  and  at  different  distances from the centre of the semi-circle,  depending  on  the  mean  hue  of  the  image.  This  revealed  a  ‘demarcation  line’  marking  the  power  outage  in  Brooklyn  during  the  Hurricane, resulting in a decrease in the number  of images and an increase in the darkness of  their  mean  hue   Hochman  and  Manovich,  2013: 12 .  The Phototrails team have made much of  the fact that their visualisations are compos- ites  within  which  individual  images  remain  visible   Hochman  and  Manovich,  2013:  4 .  However, it is clear that the orientation of the  research has been towards the identification   of  macro-level  patterns  within  the  datasets,  rather  than  towards  the  analysis  of  the  pic- torial  content  of  individual  images.  Alise  Tifentale  and  Lev  Manovich  have  observed  in retrospect that the project ‘disregarded the  content of the photos, the differences in com- positions  and  other  aspects  of  photographic  aesthetics’   Tifentale  and  Manovich,  2015:  109 . Although the Phototrails visualisations  can  tell  us  about  the  intensity  with  which  images  are  uploaded  to  Instagram  at  cer- tain  times  in  specific  places   Hochman  and  Schwartz,  2012:  2 ,  they  tell  us  little  about  what  these  images  depict,  and  why  people  created and uploaded them.  In contrast to Phototrails, which involved  working  with  different  kinds  of  image,  Selfiecity  focused  on  the  selfie  as  a  spe- cific  image-type.  The  dataset  for  the  pro- ject started out as 656,000 images extracted  from Instagram between 4 and 12 December  2013,  using  their  geo-tags  to  identify  loca- tions in the central areas of Bangkok, Berlin,  Moscow,  New  York,  and  Sao  Paolo.  This  initial dataset was reduced by random selec- tion to 120,000 images  20–30,000 for each  city . These images were then processed by  Amazon  Mechanical  Turk   AMT   workers,  who classified them according to whether or  not they depicted a selfie of a single person.4  The  top  1,000  images  from  each  city  iden- tified  as  a  single  selfie  were  resubmitted  to  AMT to be verified and classified according  to  the  gender  and  age  of  the  depicted  per- son.  These  images  were  then  examined  by  at  least  one  member  of  the  Selfiecity  team  to  edit  out  mistakes,  resulting  in  the  selec- tion of 640 selfies per city. The final corpus  of  3,200  selfies  was  then  processed  using  facial analysis software to classify them for  face  size,  pose,  emotional  demeanour,  the  presence of glasses and smiles, whether the  eyes or mouth are open or closed, as well as  for  gender  and  age   The  Graduate  Center,  CUNY, 2014: 3–4; Tifentale and Manovich,  2015: 3 . These classifications constituted the  basis  of  a  series  of  visualisations  designed  by  Moritz  Stefaner,  and  presented  on  the    analysing soCial Media iMages  163  project  website   selfiecity.net .  As  with  Phototrails,  the  results  were  generally  con- cerned  with  quantitative  patterns  within  the  corpus.  For  example,  the  researchers  found  that more selfies were taken by women and  by  younger  people,  and  more  people  were  identified as smiling in selfies from Bangkok  and Sao Paulo than from Moscow. Although  these  findings  involve  a  closer  engagement  with  the  visual  content  of  the  images  than  Phototrails,  they  remain  limited  by  their  focus on quantitative data at the expense of  explanations that deal with the social uses of  selfies. More recent work by Manovich and  Tifentale  has  taken  a  more  qualitative  turn,  attempting to identify different subjects and  styles within previously collected datasets of  Instagram images. This has involved linking  these images to earlier developments within  the history of photography  Manovich, 2015,  2016;  Tifentale  and  Manovich,  2016 .  This  work  is  interesting  in  that  it  attempts  to  ground  a  discussion  of  the  format  and  con- tent  of  Instagram  image-types  in  the  large- scale collection of images. Yet this discussion  remains  generic  and  consequently  does  not  address the question of ‘how to reconcile the  “big data approach” with a close study of an  object’  Tifentale, 2015: 6 .  Working with Images at   Different Scales  Other  studies  of  social  media  images  have  grappled  with  both  large  image-based  data- sets and the specificities of particular images.  The  first  of  this  kind  is  Larissa  Hjorth  and  Jean Burgess’ examination of images tweeted  in  response  to  the  Queensland  floods  in  Australia  in  December  2010  and  January  2011.  This  study  started  with  a  dataset  of  40,000  tweets  containing  the  hashtag  qld- floods collected for a larger study of Twitter  use in response to the disaster  Bruns et al.,  2012 . Tweets that contained links to visual  images   hosted  on  photo  sharing  services  such  as  twitpic  and  yfrog   were  identified   the   that   frequency  of   and organised according to how many times  they were retweeted. From here, Hjorth and  Burgess analysed the top 100 most retweeted  images, an approach also used in work pre- sented  later  in  this  chapter,  on  the  under- standing  their  re-circulation was a measure of their cultural  resonance  Hjorth and Burgess, 2014: 502 .  This  focus  on  a  final  corpus  of  100  images  allowed  the  authors  to  address  the  specific  content  of  the  images  in  ways  that  would  have  been  difficult  with  a  larger  set  of  images. The analysis explained photographic  images  in  terms  of  Australian  ‘larrikin’  humour, which functions as a culture-specific  coping mechanism under conditions of stress   Hjorth and Burgess, 2014: 505 .  The  second  study,  which  included  two  of  the authors, was developed after the UK riots  of August 2011 that occurred after police in  London  shot  and  killed  a  young  black  man  called  Mark  Duggan   Vis  et  al.,  2014 . This  work  involved  the  analysis  of  a  corpus  of  10,001  tweets  containing  links  to  images,  identified  within  a  larger  dataset  of  2.6  mil- lion  riot-related  tweets.5  The  10,001  tweets  containing  links  to  images  were  organised  and  categorised  according  to  their  basic  denotative  content  using  a  content  analysis  approach.  These  images  were  also  divided  into two sets: one of images shared more than  once,  and  the  other  of  images  shared  only  once. This overall image corpus was reduced  to 3,466 multiply shared images and 235 sin- gle shares. These images were classified using  13  content  analysis  categories  identified  in  relation to the original set of images, before  focusing  on  57  images  coded  under  the  cat- egory ‘Bus’, which referred to a bus set alight  in  Tottenham,  London,  where  Duggan  was  shot and where the riots began. This focus on  only  57  images  allowed  for  the  use  of  pho- tographic  theory  to  develop  close  readings  of visual content. For example, screen grabs  and cameraphone photos of TV news footage  of  the  burning  bus  were  discussed  in  rela- tion  to  John  Berger’s  understanding  that  the  act of making a photographic image involves    164  the basic statement ‘I have decided that see- ing this is worth recording’  Vis et al., 2014:  395 . This movement from content analysis of  a relatively large dataset to a close analysis of  particular images involved a shift from a sys- tematic analytical methodology to a relatively  arbitrary  choice  of  one  category  of  images  and of particular images within this category. Both  studies  involved  a  mixture  of  meth- ods that allowed for the derivation of insights  from  larger  datasets,  while  also  facilitat- ing  the  close  qualitative  analysis  of  specific  images. In both cases, researchers developed  interpretative  approaches  that  responded  to  the specific content and social context of the  images  under  consideration.  In  the  case  of   the  Queensland  flood,  identifying  appropriate  cultural references specific to the Australian  national  context  enabled  the  delineation  of  interdiscursive  relationships  between  the  images and wider cultural discourses. In the  case of the London riots, this involved using  ideas  taken  from  photography  theory.  Both  studies indicate that at the level of close quali- tative work, researchers must make relatively  intuitive  case-specific  choices  about  how  to  approach the analysis of images. This fits with  Highfield and Leaver’s  2016  point, quoted  earlier,  that  the  interpretation  of  images  on  social media requires more ‘individual inter- vention and interpretation’. In both cases, the  close analysis of specific images was depend- ent  upon  the  collection  and  organisation  of  a  larger  dataset,  but  the  qualitative  analysis  itself involved quite different interpretational  decisions. This deployment of different forms  of analysis is not a problem; rather, it consti- tutes the basis of the kind of complementary  work  with  social  media  images  at  different  scales we would encourage.  In-Depth Qualitative Analysis   of Images  Studies that focus solely on the close reading  of  specific  images  are  very  different  from  both  the  large-scale  data  collection  of   Manovich and the Software Studies Initiative,  and the quantitative aspects of the Hjorth and  Burgess  and  Vis  et  al.  studies.  In  contrast,  studies of individual images generally do not  involve the extraction and systematic process- ing  of  large  quantities  of  image-related  data  from social media platforms. An example of  this  approach  is  Heidi  Huntington’s  discus- sion  of  the  Pepper  Spray  Cop  meme,  which  circulated on social media in response to the  Occupy Wall  Street  movement   Huntingdon,  2016 . This meme was based on photographic  images of police Lieutenant John Pike pepper  spraying  seated  demonstrators  during  a  stu- dent  protest  on  the  University  of  California  Davis campus on 18 November 2011. Social  media users responded to the original photo- graphs  by  photoshopping  the  figure  of  Pike  into  other  well-known  images  to  create  humorous  and  politically  pointed  conjunc- tions. Huntington focuses on the intertextual  relationships  between  the  meme  and  its  cul- tural and political referents. For example, her  discussion of one version of the meme, which  involved  the  relocation  of  Pike  into  John  Trumbell’s famous painting of the signing of  the US Declaration of Independence, involves  both  the  physical  location  of  the  painting  in  the US Capitol Building and its relationship to  the mythology of the American Dream. This  allows her to suggest that the meme presents  Pepper  Spray  Cop  as  ‘an  attack  on  the  very  essence  of  the American  Dream  and  human  liberty’  Huntington, 2016: 88 . Huntington’s  analysis  provides  a  strong  example  of  how  social  media  images  are  made  meaningful  through  relationships  to  other  cultural  dis- courses  that  exist  within  and  beyond  social  media. It also involves a detailed discussion of  the specific ways the visual content of images  produce meaning. This makes her work com- parable to Art History analysis, which gener- ally involves close readings of small numbers  of  images  in  terms  of  their  formal  qualities,  symbolic content, and historical contexts. The  qualitative analysis of social media images is  also comparable to Art History when it comes  to  selecting  images  for  analysis,  which  is    analysing soCial Media iMages  165  often  idiosyncratic  and  guided  by  individual  research experience and intuition. Huntington  does not discuss how she selected the images  relating  to  the  Pepper  Spray  Cop  meme  she  addresses,  but  it  is  likely  that  she  simply  found  the  images  by  searching  on  social  media  platforms,  via  Google   image  search   or  websites  like  ‘Know  Your  Meme’.  This  would make her method of corpus identifica- tion similar to that adopted by Ryan Milner in  his study of OWS memes, which he gathered  by ‘visiting’ social media platforms and other  sites   Milner,  2013:  2370;  see  also  Peck,  2014 .  Like  Huntington,  Milner  focuses  on  the meanings of memes in terms of their inter- textual relationships to socio-cultural contexts  and their role within larger memetic conversa- tions.  Thus  he  states,  ‘OWS  memes  were  interdiscursive,  intertwining  multiple  texts  and  commentaries  into  complex  collages’   Milner,  2013:  2367 . Absent  from  both  his  and Huntington’s analysis is the consideration  of how, or on what scale, OWS memes circu- lated  and  were  adapted  through  digital  net- works.  Similar  observations  can  be  made  about other articles that deal with this meme   Peck,  2014;  Bayerl  and  Stoynov,  2016 .  These qualitative studies offer good examples  of how the close interpretation of images can  attend to the socio-cultural meanings of visual  social media that are excluded by the methods  employed by the Software Studies Initiative.  Yet this work also excludes much in terms of  the contexts through which images were com- municated  and  the  scale  of  their  circulation.  There  are,  however,  other  qualitative  studies  of  memes  that  give  more  attention  to  their  circulation  via  particular  platforms   Pearce,  2015   and  their  adaptation  across  different  national contexts  Shifman, 2014: 151–170 .  case sTudy: The deaTh of alan  kurdi on TWiTTer  The  final  part  of  this  chapter  explores  the  deployment  of  three  approaches   the   discussed  in  the  preceding  sections  and  applies this to images relating to the death of  Alan  Kurdi.  This  case  study  allows  for  a  focused  consideration  of  the  potential  for  bringing these different approaches together  in  a  mutually  supportive  way.  This  under- standing  of  the  complementary  potential  of  different  approaches  derives  from  the  prac- tices  of  the  Visual  Social  Media  Lab   VSML ,6  which  we  founded  in  2014  in  a  conscious effort to create a meeting point for  researchers from different sectors and disci- plinary  backgrounds,  including  Media  and  Communication Studies, Visual Culture, Art  History,  Software  Studies,  Sociology,  Computer Science and Information Science.  The aim of the VSML is to explore how dif- ferent  methods  for  the  analysis  of  social  media  images  can  be  combined  or  work  in  conjunction  with  each  other.  The  findings  presented  here  derive  from  the  VSML’s  report The Iconic Image on Social Media: A  Rapid  Research  Response  to  the  Death  of  Aylan Kurdi  Vis and Goriunova, 2015 .  Alan  Kurdi  was  a  three-year-old  Syrian  refugee  who  died  with  other  members  of  his  family  in  a  failed  attempt  to  cross  the  Mediterranean  from  Turkey  to  Greece.  The  Turkish  photojournalist  Nilüfer  Demir  pho- tographed Alan’s  dead  body  after  it  washed  up  on  Bodrum  beach  in  Turkey,  producing  a  series  of  photographs  that  depicted  the  body  lying  at  the  meeting  point  between  the  sea  and  the  beach,  or  picked  up,  in  the  arms  of  a  Turkish  policeman.  These  photo- graphs were widely published, first by Do˘gan  Haber Ajansı  DHA  news agency in Turkey  and  circulated  via  mainstream  and  social  media, triggering a significant on-the-ground  response  to  the  refugee  crisis,  including  in  the  UK,  which  was  the  main  focus  of  most  chapters  in  the  original  report.  This  report  involved 15 short articles by members of the  VSML and other invited researchers with the  aim of examining the online distribution and  use of these images, their political impact and  iconography, and the ethical implications of  their publication and circulation.   166  daTa, research quesTions   and meThods  Data was collected using Pulsar,7 a commer- cial  analytics  platform  that  allows  users  to  collect data from a range of different social  media  platforms   including  Twitter,  Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Tumblr ,  news sources, forums, and blogs. Following  collection, Pulsar offers a range of different  ways to navigate and access the data, and to  carry out different types of analysis, includ- ing network analysis. For Twitter, users can  opt to pay for a full real-time or historic fire- hose  sample.  Pulsar  was  used  to  retrieve,  analyse  and  visualise  historic  data  for  1–14  September  2015.  This  query  included  data  from  Twitter,  Tumblr,  news,  forums,  and  blogs, amounting to 2,843,274 posts in total,  with the majority coming from Twitter. The  report  also  included  findings  from  Google  search  data,  to  get  a  sense  of  global  search  patterns  during  this  period   Rogers,  2015 .  The  Pulsar  dataset  was  collected  using  a  series  of  predominantly  English  language  search terms and hashtags,8 but included the  Turkish  hashtag  kiyiyavuraninsanli,  which  was translated as ‘humanity washed ashore’.  Including the child’s first name  with various  spellings   and  last  name  as  search  terms  meant that the dataset included many differ- ent languages, given the wide circulation of  the  boy’s  name  by Twitter  users.  Below  we  outline  the  research  questions  and  methods  pertaining to the Twitter data.  Research Questions and Methods  In  the  broadest  sense  the  report  tried  to  explore  three  basic  questions:  Why  this  child?  Why  these  images?  Why  this  large- scale response now  given that so many refu- gees  had  already  died ?  Here  we  focus  on  three  approaches,  their  associated  research  questions and methods. The first involved a  large-scale analysis of the images shared on  Twitter to map the spread of the images, key   networks,  the  rate  of  spread  as  well  as  the  response  images  that  were  uploaded.  We  estimated  that  the  images  of  Alan  Kurdi  spread to 20 million  Twitter  screens in the  space of just 12 hours. To better understand  the  dynamics  of  this  diffusion  a  set  of  net- work  visualisations  were  created  to  show  how and when the images were tweeted and  retweeted over the first 12 hours after DHA  put  the  morning  of   2  September. A  subset  of  the  data  was  cre- ated  focusing  on  tweets  containing  at  least  one  of  the  images  of Alan  Kurdi  shared  by  DHA  and  posted  on Twitter  within  the  first   12 hours. Four diffusion phases were identi- fied:  the  first  hour   10.15am–11.15am ;  the  first two hours  10.15am–12.15am ; the first  three hours  10.15am–13.15pm ; and the first  12 hours  10.15am–22.15pm .  them  online  on   For  each  diffusion  phase  a  network  visu- alisation was created using the same method- ology:  Pulsar  was  used  to  create  a  network  graph  from  the  connections  between  tweets  containing  the Alan  Kurdi  images  and  their  retweets.  Pulsar  also  adds  metadata  to  each  tweet and retweet including: a code identify- ing a node as a tweet or a retweet; country;  number  of  followers; Visibility  score;  num- ber of retweets received by each tweet; and  the betweenness centrality9 of each tweet or  retweet.  The  network  graph  was  then  pro- cessed  with  the  network  visualisation  soft- ware Gephi, which uses the metadata added  by Pulsar to each node as attributes to design  the layout and visual appearance of the final  visualisations.  Before  proceeding  with  the  network  design,  additional  metadata  was  added to each node using Gephi’s statistical  tools: Average Degree and Weighted Average  Degree10  of  each  node  in  the  network.  The  metadata  generated  by  Pulsar  and  Gephi   and added to each node was used to design  the  network.  In  the  network  visualisations  names  of  private  users  have  been  blurred.  We  have  only  identified  Twitter  users  by  name and handle where we felt it was clear  that  they  were  public  figures  tweeting  in  a  public capacity.   analysing soCial Media iMages  167  In  the  visualisations,  a  node  represents  a  tweet or a retweet while an edge represents  a  tweet retweet  relationship  so  that  an  edge  only  appears  between  two  nodes  when  one  of  them  is  an  original  tweet  and  the  other  is  a  retweet  of  the  original  tweet.  The  size  of  the  nodes  indicates  the  impact  of  the   tweet retweet  on  the  audience  based  on  Pulsar’s Visibility sco.11 Visibility is a propri- etary  Pulsar  algorithm  designed  to  attribute  an  impact  score  to  each  tweet  and  retweet  based on the number of retweets it receives  and  the  level  of  reach  it  generates  directly  and  indirectly   the  size  of  the  audience  of   the  author  plus  the  size  of  the  audiences  of  anyone who has retweeted the original tweet .  We  also  examined  how  the  original  photo- graphic  images  of Alan  were  used  to  create  response images and how this happened over  time.  Differentiating  original  images  from  adaptations involved a combination of manual  identification and supported machine learning  to more quickly identify identical images.  A second approach, working with images  at  different  scales,  sought  to  better  under- stand  the  diversity  of  the  100  most  shared  Twitter  images  by  lifting  this  smaller  man- ageable  sample  from  the  larger  dataset.  To  carry out this analysis, all 100 images were  printed out so that smaller image collections  could be built and easily organised for further  inspection and analysis. We were particularly  interested in the content, date and location of  the images that were shared most frequently.  Emphasis  was  also  placed  on  the  use  of  images showing Alan before and after death,  adaptations and remediations of the original  photographic  images,  and  the  circulation  of  images within the UK. This second approach  relied  on  quantitative  content  analysis  by  manually coding the top 100 Twitter images.  A limitation to this approach is that it effec- tively amplifies the ‘loudest voices’ by focus- ing on the most shared images and does not  take  into  account  less  frequently  shared  images  in  other  parts  of  the  dataset   in  the  so-called  ‘long  tail’    Eni  et  al.,  2011; Vis,  2013 . To more fully understand the diversity   of  images  shared  additional  sampling  could  have included a sample of images that were  infrequently  shared  as  well  as  images  that  were only shared once  Vis et al., 2014 .  The  final  approach  entailed  an  in-depth  qualitative  analysis  of  a  smaller  subset  of  images  chosen  from  the  top  1,000  Twitter  images  and  selected  for  their  individual  visual qualities, in line with the researcher’s  individual  interests.  Key  questions  driving  this  approach  included  what  people  had  done  with  the  motif  of  Alan’s  body  once  they had removed it from its original photo- graphic contexts, and how relocating Alan’s  body  into  new  pictorial  contexts  through  practices  like  Photoshop  might  be  read.  This approach involves something similar to  classic art historical iconography, but is also  similar  to  the  qualitative  work  on  memes  discussed earlier.  findings  Large-Scale Image Analysis:   The Spread and Diffusion of   the Alan Kurdi Images  The Twitter journey of the Alan Kurdi images  began on the morning of 2 September 2015,  at 8.42am, when Turkish news agency DHA  posted  a  report  on  their  website  concerning  the  death  of  12  Syrian  refugees,  drowned  while  trying  to  travel  from  Turkey  to  the  Greek island of Kos in a dinghy. This Turkish  language  article  featured  a  gallery  of   50  images  taken  that  morning  on  or  near  Bodrum beach, by DHA photographer Nilüfer  Demir,  including  four  that  showed  the  dead  body  of  Alan  Kurdi.  Demir’s  photographs  were examples of professional photojournal- ism intended for dissemination through news  agencies and wires, and for publication in the  press.  When  Turkish  journalist  and  activist  Michelle Demishevich took one of the images  from a news agency website and uploaded it  to  Twitter  at  10.23am12  this  changed.

Over  the  next  hour  it  was  retweeted  33  times.  Users  in  Greece  and  Spain  started  tweeting  the  same  image.  Between  11.00am  and  11.30am  the  Turkish  language press also began to report the story  of  the  death  of  the  refugees  with  more  than   15 publications posting articles on their web- sites. But while the press was spreading the  news  to  a  mostly  Turkish  audience,  the  images of Alan’s body began to embark on a  very different international journey on Twitter  in the following hour.  ‘The first two hours’ network visualisation   Figure 9.1  is based on 1,382 nodes  tweets  and  retweets   and  1,320  edges   connections  between a tweet and a retweet .

The use of Twitter  by  journalists  and  media  organisations  was  significant, with Turkish news agencies using  Twitter to expand the local Turkish audience.  When the images spread through the Middle  East   Lebanon,  Gaza  and  Syria ,  Lebanon  became  particularly  important  when  Martin  Jay, Newsweek Middle East correspondent in  Beirut, suggested the images might be going  viral  Figure 9.1: top left corner, third node    analysing soCial Media iMages  169  figure 9.2  diffusion graph c – three hours from the appearance of the first picture on  Twitter. size of the nodes indicates impact on the audience  visibility score . colour of nodes  and edges indicates country of the user  Source: Pulsar   from the left . Less than an hour later, Peter  Bouckaert   @bouckap ,  the  Geneva-based  Emergency Director at Human Rights Watch,  posted three images of Alan Kurdi, emphasis- ing the need for an urgent plan to deal with  the refugee crisis  Figure 9.1: central node .  His  tweet  received  664  retweets  from  users  located  in  a  variety  of  countries   including  the US, UK, Australia, Malaysia , signalling  the spread of the images beyond the Middle  East. By midday on 2 September the images  had been shared fewer than 500 times  3 per  cent  of  the  total  diffusion  of  the  images  by  the end of the day . These tweets had reached  a potential audience of 500,000 Twitter users   across 100 countries.13 This situation changed  at 12.49pm,14 when Liz Sly, Washington Post  Beirut Bureau Chief, posted a tweet that was  retweeted  7,421  times;  the  most  retweeted  post  in  the  dataset.  Sly’s  tweet  transformed  the  scale  of  the  diffusion,  generating  in  the  first 30 minutes the same amount of retweets  generated  in  the  previous  two  hours   see  Figure 9.2: @LizSly top left node . ‘The first  three  hours’  network  visualisation  is  based  on  7,028  nodes   tweets  and  retweets   and  6,689  edges   connections  between  a  tweet  and a retweet .

Almost  five  hours  after  the  images  were  first  published  online,  and  three  hours  after  they  first  appeared  on  Twitter,  the  Turkish  press was the only national news media offi- cially  covering  the  story.  In  the  absence  of  international  news  coverage,  Twitter  ampli- fied  the  story  to  an  international  audience.  Findings  from  the  network  analysis  suggest  that  Twitter  functioned  as  a  decentralised  catalyst  that  delivered  this  story  to  a  highly  relevant  group  of  people   journalists,  activ- ists,  politicians,  and  aid  workers  interested  in the Middle East . It was this dynamic that  underpinned the high engagement rate in the  dataset   17  retweets  for  every  single  tweet  posted .  This  situation  changed  again  at  1.10pm,  when the UK newspaper the Daily Mail pub- lished an article on the death of Alan Kurdi.  This  story  marked  the  beginning  of  a  new  phase  of  international  diffusion,  character- ised by the heavy involvement of the interna- tional  news  media.  Between  the  publication  of  the  Daily  Mail  article  and  the  end  of   2  September,  more  than  500  articles  were  published online about Alan Kurdi and shared  on Twitter. Compared to the preceding phase  of the diffusion, the audience exposed to the  story,  sharing  the  images,  and  communicat- ing  about  them  was  now  25  times  larger.  However,  the  mainstream  news  ecosystem  ‘owned’ the story and used it to carry its own  commentaries, along with the images of Alan.  This  trend  continued  on  3  September,  when  the volume of news media content continued  to grow, fuelling an overall peak in tweets that  reached  53,000  per  hour  at  8.00pm. At  this  point, both Twitter activity and the volume of  news content decreased over the next 10 days,  eventually reaching 50 per cent of the levels  established on 2 September  see Figure 9.3 .   analysing soCial Media iMages  171  figure 9.4  alan kurdi image tweets vs variations image tweets by the hour  2 september  2015, 08:00–3 september 2015, 23.59   Source: Pulsar   The  findings  from  the  network  analysis  show that during all these developments the  diffusion of the story was consistently image- led.  However,  this  did  not  mean  that  it  was  always the same images that were being dis- tributed.  Whereas  the  original  press  photo- graphs of Alan dominated the first 48 hours  of  the  diffusion  cycle,  from  4  September  onwards they were replaced in terms of high  volume of circulation by adapted versions the  photographs  see Figure 9.4 .  The mediation of Alan Kurdi’s death was  a process deeply entwined with the capacity  of Twitter to act as a catalyst that allowed for  the  communication  of  emerging  stories  to  relevant audiences. Twitter made it possible  for global audiences to develop, connect, and  propel  the Alan  Kurdi  story  into  the  main- stream,  before  the  international  press  began  to  cover  it.  However,  one  should  not  forget  that individual journalists initially broke and  pushed the story on Twitter in the first place,  thus  facilitating  a  very  effective  diffusion  dynamic.  Working with Images at Different  Scales: The 100 Most Shared Alan  Kurdi Images  Of  the  100  most  shared  images,  11  were  shared on the first day and most  68 of 100   were  shared  during  the  first  three  days    2 September–4 September . On 2 September  this included the tweet from Liz Sly, the third  most  shared  image,  also  highlighted  in   Figure  9.2.  Of  these  11  images  shared  on   2  September,  six  are  one  of  the  original  images and five are not, indicating that on the  first day a range of different types of image  were  already  in  circulation.  These  included  images  of  Alan  alive   alongside  his  older  brother  as well as cartoons of Alan depicting  him getting picked up from the beach by an  angel.  The  remaining  32  images   of  100   were  shared  between  5  September  and   14  September.  Overall,  just  over  one  fifth    21 of 100  of the 100 most retweeted images  were  copies  of  one  of  the  photojournalistic  images of Alan’s dead body. Of these top 21,    172  13  were  images  of  Alan  alone,  lying  face  down in the surf. Less frequently shared were  images  showing  his  body  with  one  or   more  Turkish  policeman,  or  in  the  arms  of  one  of  the  policemen   4  of  21 .  Following  calls  from  Alan’s  aunt  to  share  images  of  Alan before his death, journalists in particu- lar started to encourage this type of sharing.  Seventeen  of  the  100  most  shared  Twitter  images depicted Alan alive. There were five  variations on this theme: an image that shows  Alan on his own  shared the most , standing  at  the  top  of  a  blue  slide  in  a  playground  wearing a similar outfit to the one in which  he died. Visually the viewer might be encour- aged  to  imagine  this  scene  as  the  child  just  before death: happy, smiling, full of life. The  second  image  of  Alan  alone  showed  him  about  to  kick  a  football.  His  outfit  is  again  similar to the one he died in. Once more, one  might  assume  this  image  was  chosen  and  retweeted multiple times due to the similarity  between the two outfits. Two images included  Alan’s older brother Ghalib: one where both  boys  are  sitting  on  a  sofa  with  a  white  toy  bear between them, the other showing Ghalib  with  a  protective  arm  around Alan.  In  both  images the boys smile sweetly at the camera,  most  likely  indicating  it  was  taken  by  a  family member. Only one image shows Alan  with his brother and father, Abdullah Kurdi,  and none show their mother. The images that  show Alan before his death suggest a happy  childhood  and  familial  normality,  in  stark  contrast  to  the  images  of  his  dead  body  on  the beach.  Nearly  a  fifth  of  the  most  shared  images   17  of  100   involved  remediations  of  the  original  photograps  of  Alan’s  body  on  the  beach.  These  included  cartoons  and  photo- graphs  of  sand  sculptures  or  performances  intended to be photographically documented,  including one involving children in Morocco  dressed  in  similar  outfits  to Alan  emulating  his pose in death by lying face down on the  beach in Rabat.  Focusing on location, 24 images in the top  100  were  shared  from  the  UK  and  include   a  wide  range  of  different  image-types.  It  is  perhaps surprising that none of these images  were the original press photographs. Instead,  the  original  photographs  were  presented  indirectly  through  the  sharing  of  images  of  newspaper  front  pages,  including  compila- tion  images  that  highlighted  how  individual  newspapers  had  changed  their  stand  on  the  refugee  crisis.  This  was  done,  for  example,  by combining past and present front pages of  The  Sun  newspaper  to  illustrate  the  paper’s  ‘U-turn’ from a staunchly anti-refugee posi- tion  to  a  position  temporarily  sympathetic  towards  people  fleeing  from  Syria. Another  strategy was to present a compilation of front  pages from papers across the political spec- trum  to  emphasise  a  shared  position  on  the  refugee  crisis.  These  images  function  as  a  kind of meta-commentary on the mainstream  media. The compilation image of newspaper  front  pages  from  across  the  political  spec- trum was accompanied by a tweet that urged  UK Prime Minister David Cameron to ‘wake  up’  and  for  the  UK  to  play  a  larger  part  in  responding to the refugee crisis. Other users  also urged the UK to do more, by posting info- graphics emphasising that the UK could and  should take in more refugees, or highlighting  how few refugees had been allowed to come  to the UK so far. An image of Buckingham  Palace was combined with text that indicated  there  was  space  in  this  building  for  at  least  1,000  refugees,  while  another  image  sug- gested that all of the Syrian refugees allowed  to enter the UK so far could fit into a single  London Underground train.  Other UK-specific tweets involved sharing  images of text containing comments mocking  David Cameron’s policy towards the refugee  crisis.  One  in  particular  adopted  a  satirical  approach to the change in UK policy after the  widespread distribution of the photographs of  Alan’s  body. This  text  adopted  the  voice  of  the UK Prime Minister, stating: ‘Britain has  a moral responsibility to help refugees, even  though it didn’t a couple of days ago’. There  were  also  images  depicting  politicians,  fea- turing images of their faces next to quotations    analysing soCial Media iMages  173  of them pledging to play their full part in find- ing  solutions  to  the  crisis   Scotland’s  First  Minister Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted from her  own account , or showing politicians posing  with ‘Refugees Welcome’ signs  Green Party  MP, Caroline Lucas , as well as an image of  Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted  from his account, showing him looking over  a  crowd  gathered  in  Parliament  Square  in  London.  The  text  in  this  tweet  highlighted  that these people had gathered because they  wanted a government that will respond prop- erly to the crisis. Linked to this theme, two  final  images  highlight  moments  in  history  when the UK did far more to help refugees  from  elsewhere  in  Europe.  One  of  these  was  an  appropriated  black  and  white  ana- logue  photograph  of  a  large  steamship  in  Southampton  dock.  The  text  accompanying  this image stated that it shows how the UK  accepted  4,000  Basque  children  in  1937,  asking:  ‘would  we  have  let  them  drown?’   The implication here is that in the past the UK  accepted refugees from Southern Europe, but  was  now  unwilling  to  accept  refugees  from  the Middle East.  As was stated in the previous section, the  original  press  photographs  of  Alan  domi- nated the first 48 hours of the diffusion cycle,  followed by the wide circulation of adapted  versions  of  the  originals.  What  this  brief  analysis of the 100 most shared images has  shown is how content analysis can help gain  further insight into the findings from larger- scale analysis, including during specific time  periods.  By  further  focusing  on  country-  specific  sharing,  more  nuance  about  the  national socio-cultural situated-ness of this  image sharing can be gleaned.  In-Depth Qualitative Analysis of  Images: The Adaptation of the  Original Alan Kurdi Images  This final section of the case study presents  findings  from  a  qualitative  analysis  of  images that involved the creative adaptation   of  the  original  press  photographs  of Alan’s  body. This work involved manually identify- ing  cartoons  and  photoshopped  images  among the top 1,000 most retweeted images  within the dataset, without considering how  much  each  individual  image  had  been  retweeted.  This  selection  was  then  further  reduced  through  the  identification  of  two  smaller  sets  of  images  that  shared  pictorial  characteristics, the first involving the reloca- tion of the motif of Alan’s body lying on the  beach to a different pictorial context and the  second including the relocation of his body  from  the  arms  of  the  Turkish  policeman  to  the  arms  of  another  figure.  We  selected  examples  from  these  two  smaller  sets  of  images for visual analysis. Like most iconic  images,  the  original  photographs  of Alan’s  body  on  the  beach  and  in  the  arms  of  the  policeman are simple in terms of their visual  content. The most significant element of the  photos was Alan’s body itself, with its easily  identifiable  clothing.  Through  practices  of  pictorial  adaptation, Alan’s  body  became  a  movable  motif   much  like  Pepper  Spray  Cop   that  was  also  metaphorically  adapta- ble,  as  demonstrated  by  the  examples  from  both sets of adapted images considered here. The relocation of the motif of Alan’s body  lying on the beach to different contexts gen- erated a range of unexpected associations that  involved what appear to be attempts to estab- lish relationships of moral culpability for the  death of the child. In some examples this cul- pability involved the suggestion of responsi- bility for the conditions that caused the Kurdi  family to become refugees and, by extension,  for Alan’s death. For example, in one image  Alan’s body was photoshopped into a scene  of the family of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad  sitting at a dinner table blowing out candles  on a birthday cake, with the body replacing  the cake. This photoshopped image produces  a  shocking  visual  conjunction  between  a  family  celebration  and  the  death  of  a  child.  In  other  examples,  different  parties  appear  to  have  been  identified  as  culpable  for  not  acting  to  prevent Alan’s  death.  One  cartoon    174  involved the relocation of his body to the cen- tre of a large round table in a room decorated  with  the  European  Union  emblem.  Around  this  table  sit  a  number  of  EU  officials  who  are facing away from the body. The rhetorical  implication of the cartoon is straightforward:  the officials have failed to respond to the ref- ugee crisis that caused Alan’s death and are  now refusing to see his corpse. This format  was  repeated  in  a  photoshopped  image  that  involved  the  relocation  of  the  body  to  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  Chamber.  Although this time the council members face  the  body,  they  appear  to  not  see  its  blatant  presence  on  the  floor.  The  theme  of  these  images  is  not  only  culpability,  but  also  the  apparent contradiction between the high vis- ibility  of  the  image  of Alan’s  body  enabled  by  its  mass  circulation  and  the  indifference  of official bodies. But it was not only the EU  and the UN which were identified as culpa- ble through the visual relocation of the body  to their meetings. Arab leaders and the Gulf  States  were  also  identified  as  failing  in  the  face of the Syrian refugee crisis. Thus, Alan’s  body was relocated to composite images fea- turing  the  luxurious  skylines  of  Qatar  and  Dubai.  The  body  was  also  photoshopped  into the middle of the Arab League meeting  chamber and drawn in front of a set of Arab  leaders, who appear to have dug a grave for  the  boy.  These  images  function  affectively  through a form of guilt by visual association  and  attest  to  the  transposable  metaphorical  power of the motif of Alan’s body.  The images that involved the relocation of  Alan’s body from the arms of the policeman  to the arms of another figure also entail dif- ferent connotations. One cartoon depicted the  body in the arms of a weeping crocodile that  sits next to a wall topped with barbed wire,  suggesting  hypocrisy  on  the  part  of  those  who  show  concern  for  Alan’s  death  while  blocking  the  movement  of  other  refugees.  Another example, that appears to have been  circulated  specifically  in  the  Middle  East,  involved the photoshopping of the body into  the arms of Saddam Hussein, with a text in   Arabic at the bottom that read: ‘If I was still  alive  this  would  not  have  happened’.  The  exact  significance  of  this  combination  of  text and image is unclear, though it appears  to  have  arisen  and  gained  its  meaning  from  the  contemporary  political  struggle  in  the  region  between  Sunni  and  Shia  communi- ties, Saddam being identified here as a great  Sunni  leader.  Given  that  Saddam  was  dead  at the time of the creation of this image, the  conjunction of him and Alan’s body suggests  their  existence  together  in  the  afterlife. The  meaning  of  this  image  was  also  contested  in  that  it  entered  the  dataset  through  its   re-circulation by a Kurdish user who tweeted  in English: ‘Arabs are spreading this picture of  Saddam  Hussein  holding  AlanKurdi,  sure  because Saddam loved Kurdish children …’  In  this  tweet,  the  photoshopped  image  of  Saddam holding Alan was combined with an  image of children killed during the chemical  weapon attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja  enacted by Saddam’s regime in 1988.  This  qualitative  analysis  of  pictorial  re-  contextualisations  of  Alan’s  body  attests  to  how this motif was rapidly reframed in rela- tion  to  very  different  cultural  and  political  imaginaries  and  for  different  rhetorical  pur- poses. As such, the use of the motif of Alan’s  body presented a particularly strong example  of the ‘migration’ of images that has been a  crucial  aspect  of  their  cultural  function  for  millennia   Wittkower,  1977;  Belting,  2011 ,  but  which  has  gained  an  accelerated  inten- sity through social media. This discussion of  adapted  images  also  continues  the  general  movement  of  the  overall  analysis  from  large  to small scale, a movement that starts from the  large-scale  network  analysis,  continues  with  the analysis of the 100 most retweeted images,  and ends with the close discussion of a much  smaller selection of images. This analysis adds  detail to the findings of the network analysis,  namely the circulation of adapted images after  the first 48 hours of the dispersion of the origi- nal  photographs.  Although  this  discussion  does  not  examine  when  or  how  frequently  particular images circulated, it provides some    analysing soCial Media iMages  175  indication  of  what  these  images  were  and  what they might have been intended to mean.  conclusion  This  chapter  has  discussed  three  methodo- logical  approaches  to  the  analysis  of  social  media  images:  large-scale  image  analysis;  working with images at different scales; and  in-depth  qualitative  analysis  of  images. The  survey  of  the  research  literature  provided  examples  of  studies  that  analysed  different  datasets and subjects according to these three  approaches.  Our  case  study  applied  these  three approaches to a single dataset and sub- ject, demonstrating that they can be used to  draw  different  insights  from  the  same  data  and function in a mutually supportive way.  The network analysis segmented the larger  dataset to create four distinct phases of diffu- sion concentrating on the first 12 hours after  the  images  of Alan  Kurdi  were  released  by  Turkish  news  agency  DHA.  This  approach  identified  key  actors  in  specific  locations,  tracing the spread of images from the Turkish  Twittersphere to the eventual adoption of the  story by the international mainstream media.  This approach showed that Twitter was a key  mechanism driving this story into the main- stream. Further analysis showed that these  images  were  widely  adapted  and  shared   48  hours  after  the  originals  had  been  circu- lated. This approach was thus able to give a  top-level  overview  of  how  different  images  had  spread  and  were  shared  on Twitter,  but  did not focus on their content or context.  By  examining  the  content  and  some  of  the national context of the 100 most shared  images,  the  network  analysis  was  extended,  both  confirming  and  adding  to  the  previous  findings.  It  showed  that  while  the  image  of  Alan alone and dead on the beach was the most  shared from 2 September onwards, additional  images  were  also  shared,  including  those  of Alan  still  alive. As  the  100  most  shared  images  included  images  shared  between    2 September and 14 September, the diversity  of these images was discussed. A limitation  of this approach remains that while it looked  in more depth at the most shared images, this  analysis was not able to shed light on images  that were shared less frequently. On the other  hand,  while  the  final  in-depth  qualitative  analysis did not systematically sample from  the top 1,000 most shared images to identify  the  least  shared  images,  the  discussion  still  included  images  with  very  few  shares. This  analysis was also able to show far more con- text  for  individual  images,  highlighting  the  international nature of some images and how  they might be interpreted.  This  chapter  has  thus  advocated  that  the  study of visual social media may benefit from  including a range of methods that, combined,  can  offer  deep  insight  into  a  single  dataset.  While we have given examples of three spe- cific approaches via the literature review and  our  case  study,  we  do  not  wish  to  be  pre- scriptive.  Instead  we  have  sought  to  show  the  possibility  of  productively  combining  approaches,  which  can  help  shape  the  next  phase of this field of research.

Ethnography is the primary research method  and methodology of anthropology, but ethno- graphically-informed  approaches  are  used  across a wide range of disciplines in contem- porary scholarship, including those engaged  with social media research. This chapter will  examine  the  role  that  ethnography  can  play  in understanding social media’s impact upon  social life, demonstrating ethnography’s apt- ness for discovering new types of socialities  and  relationships  that  are  made  possible  by  social  media.  We  will  also  discuss  whether  the migration of ethnographic methodologies  to other disciplines  hastened as researchers  across  a  broad  range  of  fields  grapple  with  understanding social media in the context of  everyday action  poses a threat to the distinc- tiveness of anthropology itself.  Sanjek  2010  notes that ethnography has a  distinctively dual nature, being both the main  practice   undertaking  fieldwork  and  partici- pant  observation   and  product   in  terms  of  ethnographic  writing  such  as  monographs  and  articles   of  anthropological  research.  Therefore,  rather  than  limiting  our  scope  to  ethnography  as  a  tool  for  better  under- standing social media, this chapter will also  examine  how  social  media  is  changing  eth- nography. We demonstrate that the increasing  ubiquity of social media in societies through- out the world not only constitutes a new focus  of comparative ethnographic research, but is  also profoundly reshaping how ethnographic  research is conducted. This chapter does not  provide  readers  with  a  ‘how-to’  guide  for  performing  ethnography  on  social  media,  but argues that ethnography and social media  should be considered as two sets of practices  and  artefacts  that  are  themselves  undergo- ing  constant  change  and  development,  and  are set on a course which will involve them  becoming  increasingly  bound  in  interaction    180  with each other, with important implications  for  how  social  research  is  conducted  more  broadly.  This  chapter  is  divided  into  two  parts.  First, we examine ethnography as a practice,  and second, as a product. In both instances,  we give a concise summary of the literature  that  has  informed  the  development  of  that  aspect  of  ethnography,  before  considering  relevant  recent  scholarship  on  researching  social  media  through  ethnography   largely  from  within  the  emerging  subfield  of  digi- tal  anthropology,  but  also  considering  it’s  adoption  by  a  range  of  cross-disciplinary  scholars ,  placing  this  in  context  to  other  approaches to studying social m distinctive- ness edia. We also draw on our own research  from  the  Why  We  Post  project,1  conducted  through  University  College  London.2  This  study  presented  a  unique  opportunity  to  research  social  media  ethnographically,  involving  nine  anthropologists  spread  over  eight  countries.3  Eight  of  the  researchers  lived for 15 months in towns with relatively  small  populations   18,000–25,000  people   in  Brazil,  Chile,  North  and  South  China,  India,  Italy,  Trinidad  and  Turkey,  and  one  lived close to his field site in England, across  2012–2014. The result was an in-depth, com- parative  study  of  the  uses  of  social  media   Miller  et  al.,  2016   based  on  nine  closely  integrated  ethnographies   Costa,  2016;  Haynes,  2016;  McDonald,  2016;  Miller,  2016;  Nicolescu,  2016;  Sinanan,  2017;  Spyer,  2017;  Venkatraman,  2017;  Wang,  2016 . This chapter calls on some of our own  practical  experiences  participating  in  the  study, in addition to other recent scholarship  that addresses this issue.  The chapter closes with a discussion of how  social media brings the practice and product  of ethnography together in a closer relation- ship. Although  for  the  purposes  of  organis- ing this chapter we have chosen to maintain  this  split  between  ethnography-as-practice  and ethnography-as-product, in reality these  two  aspects  have  always  influenced  each  other: decisions made on which ethnographic   approach to adopt will inevitably dictate the  nature  of  the  final  ethnographic  product.  Further, the presence of social media is pro- gressively  blurring  the  boundaries  between  these two aspects of ethnography. We argue  that the future of anthropology as a discipline  may be better safeguarded by embracing the  opportunities  offered  by  technologies  such  as  social  media  in  reshaping  both  ethno- graphic practice and product to better fit the  contemporary  world,  rather  than  attempting  to  defensively  confine  ethnography  within  anthropology’s disciplinary boundaries.  social media and   eThnographic process  It  is  the  process,  or  method  of  ethnography  where  social  media  is  arguably  having  the  most  noticeable  and  most  discussed  effects  on  how  anthropologists  go  about  their  research.  Postill  and  Pink   2012   helpfully  identify  three  particular  challenges  created  by  the  growth  of  social  media,  which  will  form the focus of this section:  They  [social  media]  create  new  sites  for  ethno- graphic  fieldwork,  foster  new  types  of  ethno- graphic practice, and invite critical perspectives on  the  theoretical  frames  that  dominate  internet  studies, thus providing opportunities for re-think- ing internet research methodologically.  Postill and  Pink, 2012: 214   In  response  to  Postill  and  Pink’s  first  chal- lenge,  we  find  that  social  media  represents  not only a new location for fieldwork, but is  also increasingly becoming the explicit topic  of anthropological research  see, for example,  boyd, 2014; Miller, 2011; Miller et al., 2016;  Postill, 2014 . Such studies have precipitated  a  range  of  ethnographic  insights  on  a  wide  variety of themes. They have made scholarly  impacts by placing the global phenomena of  social  media  within  local  contexts,  and  understanding  how  it  is  appropriated  differ- ently in different locales  Miller et al., 2016 ;    ethnograPhy  181  highlighting  the  reciprocity  that  underlies  social media use  Miller, 2011 ; showing the  divisions between parents and children with  regard to social media use, and how parents  often make the situation worse  boyd, 2014 ;  documenting  how  people  with  disabilities  develop  their  own  social  media  practices   to  enable  self-represesentation   Ginsburg,  2012 ; and detailing how user’s selfhood can  emerge  through  the  configuration  and  reor- dering of online spaces  Horst, 2009 .  With  regard  to  Postill  and  Pink’s   2012   assertion that social media create new types  of  ethnographic  practice,  we  note  that  for  the  majority  of  anthropological  researchers,  social  media  are  not  their  explicit  focus  of  research;  rather,  these  communication  tech- nologies  increasingly  impinge  upon  their  own  research  topics  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that their participants make extensive use of  many of these platforms. As a result, themes  which are central anthropological concerns –   including  religion,  politics,  gender  and   kinship – are enacted on  or through the use  of   these  platforms.  This  carries  important  implications for all researchers carrying out  ethnography,  including  those  not  explicitly  focused on social media use. The ubiquity of  these platforms in participants’ lives necessi- tates that ethnographers should be proficient  in conducting research on, about and around  social  media.  The  following  review  section  will demonstrate that the literature regarding  the  practice  of  internet  ethnography   rather  than  social  media  specifically   is  relatively  well  developed  and  ever-expanding,  albeit  dominated by reflexive discussions of how to  carry out research online.  Hine’s Virtual Ethnography  2000  argues  that attitudes towards the internet have impor- tant  repercussions  for  the  ways  it  is  used  or  how  individuals  relate  to  it,  once  these  beliefs  are  understood  within  broader  cul- tural  contexts   2000:  8 .  She  sees  the  inter- net as a product of culture, and ethnography  as a mode of engaging with practices within  such contexts. This, she posits, is invaluable  for  deriving  comparative  understandings  of   how  the  internet  connotes  different  cultural  meanings  to  different  people   2000:  29 .  However,  Hine  also  asserts  that  internet   ethnography  does  not  necessarily  involve  physical  immersion  into  a  particular  geo- graphic  location.  Rather,  internet  ethnog- raphy  is  more  concerned  with  experiential  immersion into particular social spaces of the  internet,  where,  similar  to  more  traditional  forms  of  ethnography,  researchers  negoti- ate access, observe different interactions and  interact with participants themselves  2000:  45,  46 .  Hine  later  develops  these  ideas  fully by challenging previous distinctions of  immaterial  ‘virtual’  space  in  opposition  to  material ‘physical’ space, claiming the inter- net is increasingly embedded, embodied, and  everyday  Hine, 2015: 55 . This leads Hine  to call for an autoethnographic approach as  the  most  apt  way  to  engage  with  the  mun- dane,  unbounded  and  ubiquitous  nature  of  the internet. In  The   Internet:  An  Ethnographic  Approach,  Miller  and  Slater   2000   agree  that uses of the internet are only meaningful  when situated in particular places and wider  generalisations  about  patterns  of  usage  are  better grounded within comparative ethnog- raphy.  However,  their  ethnography  differs  in approach from Hine in the emphasis they  afford to ‘grounded’ offline fieldwork. Based  on research conducted in Trinidad and build- ing  on  Miller’s  long-term  engagement  with  the island, Miller and Slater conclude that the  internet  is  a  ‘Trinidadian  place’  and  refute  the terms ‘online’, ‘virtual’ and ‘cyber’ when  used to suggest the internet is a place separate  from any physical one  2000: 4 . Long-term  involvement  with  individuals  allowed  the  researchers  to  contextualise  people’s  inter- net usage within other aspects of their social  lives, which Miller and Slater argue is criti- cal to understanding what the internet is and  means in Trinidad  2000: 21 .  Treating  the  internet  as  an  immersive  space  in  which  to  conduct  fieldwork  per- haps  best  culminates  in  Tom  Boellstorff’s   2008  study on Second Life, where he uses    182  a  traditional  ethnographic  approach,  albeit  while treating the online ‘synthetic’ world of  Second Life as his field site. Creating an ava- tar called Tom Bukowski and a home called  Ethnographia,  Boellstorff  observes,  partici- pates and interacts with others, using his own  avatar as a means to research the social world  of  Second  Life  and  the  behaviours  of  those  who  inhabit  it.  One  of  the  most  significant  contributions  of  the  volume  is  Boellstorff’s  attempt  to  collapse  the  distinction  between  the  ‘virtual’  and  the  ‘real’:  he  argues  that  the virtual should rather be thought of as an  extension  of  the  ‘real’   through  the  flow  of  culture across on- and offline domains , and  that our ‘real’ lives have, in fact, been ‘vir- tual’ all along  2008: 5 .  In  a  similar  vein,  working  from  the  assumption that digital spaces take their cue  from  their  non-digital  counterparts,  Horst’s  study  of  teenagers  and  the  social  network  site MySpace concludes that personal pages  are  far  less  about  asserting  individualism,  but  how  ‘individuals  exist  in  alignment  with  highly  socialised  media  of  expression’   Horst, 2009: 99 . Drawing on a material cul- ture approach, Horst uses digital platforms to  explore the relationship between places, per- sons  and  objects.  By  visiting  teenage  users  in their homes and seeing their most private  spaces  –  their  bedrooms  –  Horst  concludes  that  Facebook  and  MySpace  are  digital  spaces that affirm physical and material rela- tionships, tastes and values  2009: 108 .  Responding to the proliferation of ethno- graphic  studies  in  the  mid-2000s,  Coleman   2010   gives  an  excellent  review  on  ethno- graphic  approaches  to  digital  media   non- analogue  technologies,  mobile  phones,  internet  and  software  apps,  but  not  social  media  in  particular ,  in  which  she  identi- fies  interlinked  and  overlapping  categories  of  scholarship.  Studies  of  the  cultural  poli- tics  of  digital  media  examine  ‘how  cultural  identities, representation and imaginaries, for  example, youth, diaspora, nation or indigene- ity are remade, subverted, communicated and  circulated  through  individual  and  collective   engagement with technologies’  2010: 488 .  Coleman highlights how vernacular cultures  of  digital  media  typically  focus  on  more  incongruent  phenomena,  such  as  particular  genres or groups, hackers, blogging, memes,  migrant  programmers  and  logics  around  properties of such media. She describes the  ‘prosaics’  or more mundane aspects  of dig- ital media as how media are integrated into,  reflect or shape other kinds of practices, such  as  economic  exchange,  finance  or  religious  worship.  Coleman  historicises  the  stud- ies  she  reviews  within  shifting  theoretical  trends,  such  as  the  anthropological  concern  with the impact of globalisation on localities  and the emerging network society, and con- cludes that ethnography contributes to better  understanding  digital  media  in  relation  to  history, context and lived experience  2010:  488–489 .  trends   The  relationships  between  politics  and  social media  or previously, social network- ing sites  have also been given considerable  attention  to  contextualise  how  digital  activ- ism  and  organisation  has  translated  into   physical  activism  and  protest.  Adopting  a  similar approach to Coleman, Postill  2014   highlights  how  contemporary  in  anthropology often conceptualise the ‘global’  in  a  way  that  is  seen  to  encroach  on  the   stationary,  bounded  spaces  of  the  ‘local’   2014: 414 . He argues that social life under- stood  ethnographically  cannot  simply  be  reduced  to  a  community-versus-network  binary,  instead  advocating  for  the  use  of   ethnographic research to add depth and com- plexity to the theoretical debates surrounding  concepts  of  community  and  network  socie- ties. Ethnographic studies of communities are  not always best served by prolonged engage- ment in a single, clearly bounded field site:  Tufekci  and  Wilson’s   2012   ethnographic  study of protest ecologies illustrates how fol- lowing a protest movement within a physical  context is far more challenging than analys- ing online political participation. They chal- lenge  the  assumption  that  social  media  can  contribute  to  resisting  authoritarian  regimes    ethnograPhy  183  by  emphasising  that  there  are  few  accounts  of  how  social  media   or  the  internet  more  broadly   are  used  by  protestors  as  events  unfold in real time  2012: 363 . Their study  uses  ethnographic  methods  in  the  aftermath  of the 2011 Tahrir Square protests in Egypt to  observe the protest’s ecology and gain insider  knowledge  from  participants;  however,  they  note  that  encounters  with  participants,  which  occurred  in  semi-controlled  public  spaces such as cafés and parks around Tahrir  Square,  were  characterised  by  anxiety,  fear  and panic. The main contribution of Tufekci  and  Wilson’s  study  is  to  demonstrate  how  media ecologies during the protest movement  reconfigured  certain  social  relations  from  face-to-face  conversations  to  social  media  chats, which rapidly accelerated the speed of  the movement’s social actions.  A  number  of  scholars  have  speculated  on  different  factors  that  may  contribute  to  a  social  movement’s  success  online.  In  his  study  of  the  Spanish  ‘indignados’  political  organisation,  Postill   2014   coins  the  term  ‘media epidemiography’ to explain how the  movement  suddenly  gained  momentum.  He  observed the protest directly in Barcelona, as  well as following the techno-political context  over Twitter,  and  concludes  that  throughout  the  movement  activists  showed  ‘selective  uses of viral and non-viral contents both on  and offline’  2013: 14 . In a complimentary  study,  Lim   2013:  646   examines  the  rela- tionship between users and social media for  activism.  Based  on  interviews  and  analyses  of  blog  posts,  Lim  draws  on  her  prior  in- depth  knowledge  of  the  Indonesian  social  and  historical  context  to  identify  the  condi- tions where social media might lead to suc- cessful  forms  of  activism.  She  argues  that  social media activism is more likely to mobi- lise individuals if the narratives of the cause  are  easy  to  understand,  appeal  to  senses  of  nationalism  and  religiosity,  and  invite  low  risk action  2013: 638 .  In  reviewing  this  body  of  literature,  one  can be forgiven for thinking that the reflexive  discussion of how to carry out research online   overtakes the desire to discover the actual use  and  transformation  of  digital  platforms  by  research subjects, and the implications these  have  for  how  people  understand  their  place  in the world. Methodological reflections are  clearly vital in strengthening critical engage- ment with regards to the validity and repre- sentativeness of research data. However, we  are  also  keen  to  pair  these  discussions  with  our  own  experiences  of  conducting  ethnog- raphy.  In  the  Why  We  Post  project,  we  did  not  seek  out  overt  political  engagement  or  activism  as  a  focus  of  research,  for  exam- ple.  Instead,  our  approach  to  politics  was  to  uncover  how  and  in  what  forms  political  engagement  occurs  through  observations  of  social  media  use  and  daily  interactions  in  our  field  sites   Miller  et  al.,  2016:  142 .  In  this sense, our topics of study were primar- ily driven by participants’ actions, rather than  presumed objects of inquiry.  The above examples demonstrate the emer- gence  of  a  number  of  key  anthropologists  who  have  been  influential  in  using  ethno- graphic methods to understand social media,  and  in  so  doing  establish  the  subfield  of  digital anthropology. A further key develop- ment has been the migration of ethnographic  methods from the confines of the anthropo- logical discipline and towards a broad range  of scholars in fields such as human–computer  interaction,  media,  communication  and  cul- tural  studies.  The  result  of  this  dispersion  of  ethnographic  method  into  many  subdis- ciplines has been a wide body of exemplary  ethnographic  publications  that  have  greatly  enriched our understanding of the impact of  social  media   and  other  ICT  use   across  a  wide range of platforms and cultural settings.  Examples  include  Baym’s   1994   study  of  Usenet groups, Burrell’s  2012  ethnography  of Ghanaian internet cafés, Coleman’s  2012   account  of  Debian  hackers,  and  Kelty’s   2008   study  of  open-source  software,  to  name  but  a  few. We,  as  authors  of  the  cur- rent  chapter,  find  this  dispersion  of  the  eth- nographic  approach  particularly  of  interest  given that our own personal trajectories have    184  been very grounded within this central group  of digital anthropologists  Sinanan originally  completed her PhD in Development Studies,  but  conducted  her  Postdoctoral  research  in  the  Anthopology  Department  at  University  College  London  before  joining  RMIT  University  in  Melbourne,  while  McDonald  continuously  trained  as  an  anthropologist  from  undergraduate  level .  Our  interest  in  the increasing adoption of ethnography in a  wide range of disciplines lies not only in how  data obtained through ethnographic methods  are  being  used  to  address  a  range  of  ques- tions  beyond  the  traditional  remit  of  con- vential  anthropological  topics,  but  also  how  this  poses  something  of  an  existential  chal- lenge to anthopology’s claim to disciplinary  distinctiveness.  Postill  and  Pink   2012   also  advocate  a  shift  in  the  methodological  emphasis  of  research  away  from  specific  ‘objects’  of  study  e.g., communities and social network  models , instead calling for increased atten- tion to various forms of action  such as rou- tines, mobilities and socialities . They posit  that  focusing  on  everyday,  lived  action  can  inform  theoretical  understandings  of  digi- tal  media,  while  keeping  such  explanations  firmly  ‘grounded’  in  the  realities  of  every- day  life.  Polymedia   Madianou  and  Miller,  2012, 2013  is an example of a theory having  emerged  from  ethnographic  inquiry,  and  in  this section we will examine how polymedia  applied to our own ethnographic findings.  Madianou  2015  argues that ethnography  might  be  the  only  way  to  gain  an  in-depth  understanding  of  how  uses  of  social  media  are  shaped  by  relational  dynamics  and  con- text,  and  is  thus  essential  for  understanding  the ‘social’ dimension of social media. Along  with Miller, Madianou coined the term ‘poly- media’   Madianou  and  Miller,  2012,  2013 ,  which  recognises  that  people  use  different  forms of communication  e.g., phone calls as  opposed  to  text  messages   or  different  plat- forms  according  to  the  relationship  to  the  person they are communicating with.4 While  Miller and Madianou concede that cost may   still  be  a  factor  in  accessing  digital  media,  they nevertheless argue that social media use  has undergone rapid expansion in developing  countries such as Trinidad and the Philippines   Madianou, 2015; Madianou & Miller 2013   that  have  also  seen  a  growth  of  low-cost  communication  technologies.  Polymedia  is  particularly  ethnographic  in  nature  as  the  concept  recognises  how  different  com- munications  media  are  situated  within  their  wider  media  ecologies.  The  concept  recog- nises how each medium finds its place with  respect to other media  Horst et al., 2010; Ito,  2010, Madianou and Miller, 2013; Slater and  Tacchi, 2004 , idioms of practice and media  ideologies  Gershon, 2010 .  One of the key differences between ethno- graphic approaches to studying social media  and  other  methods,  such  as  surveys,  ques- tionnaires and content analysis, is that the lat- ter may become decontexualised from other  forms  of  communication  and  lived  relation- ships  Acquisti and Gross, 2006; Carpenter,  2012;  Dwyer  et  al.,  2007;  Junco,  2012 .  In  the  Why  We  Post  project,  our  ethnographic  approach  involved  not  only  living  in  our  respective field sites for an extended period  of  time,  but  becoming  involved  in  the  lives  of the people we studied. In some cases, this  meant volunteering in a local kindergarten or  school, assisting with cooking for an event or  helping with everyday work, in order to make  genuine  friendships.  The  underlying  idea  is  a commitment to ‘holistic contextualisation’,  where one aspect of a person, such as social  media  use,  is  examined  in  respect  to  other  parts of a person’s life that they might experi- ence simultaneously  Miller et al., 2016: 28 .  We  conducted  formal  interviews  and  ques- tionnaires throughout the fieldwork, but most  of  the  original  insights  came  from  spend- ing  extended  periods  of  time  with  different  people. Ideally, each researcher attempted to  familiarise themselves with people from dif- ferent social groups or geographical areas in  their field site, so as to gain a more compre- hensive  knowledge  of  the  place.  Crucially,  after  identifying  the  most  commonly  used    ethnograPhy  185  platforms in the site, each researcher aimed  to befriend around 150 of their research par- ticipants  on  social  media  and  follow  their  online activities, ideally for the entire course  of  the  fieldwork.  This  chapter  now  turns  to  discuss a detailed example of how this pro- cess  of  forming  relationships  in  the  field  became  understood  through  an  ethnography  of – and on – social media.  relaTionships of TrusT To  inform grounded Theory  Sinanan discovered early in her fieldwork in  Trinidad that asking to befriend someone on  Facebook  after  having  just  met  is  more  common than asking for a phone number. As  each  researcher  had  created  a  dedicated  social  media  account  for  research,  Sinanan  found that participants were initially scepti- cal of her and were uncomfortable with being  added as a friend to a research profile. Once  she  had  populated  the  profile  with  some  images from her ‘normal’ life in Melbourne,  posted  updates,  chatted  with  new  contacts  and liked and commented on posts by others,  she found that becoming friends on Facebook  worked alongside getting to know people in  her  field  site.  By  the  end  of  her  fieldwork,  she had accumulated 267 Facebook friends,  all  of  whom  she  had  met  face  to  face,  and  chatted with 38 people on WhatsApp. Having  several  research  participants  as  contacts  on  different  social  media  platforms,  as  well  as  spending time with them on a regular basis,  enabled Sinanan to illustrate how a theory of  polymedia unfolds in context.  In Sinanan’s research, polymedia was use- ful not only to account for how Trinidadians  relate to each other, but as a way for Sinanan  to understand how she should relate to par- ticipants.  As  a  social  theory  of  media  that  has  been  developed  from  ethnography  and  anthropological  theory,  polymedia  occupies  a  niche  that  addresses  the  uses  of  media  in  the  context  of  relationships.  One  of  the   implications of the combination of media is  that communications allow for the control of  emotions and power asymmetries in relation- ships   Madianou  and  Miller,  2012;  Miller  and  Sinanan,  2014 .  Polymedia  suggests  that media help to constitute social relation- ships. The example of the Trinidadian idiom  ‘liming’  below  demonstrates how forms of  sociality  that  existed  prior  to  social  media  translate  to  WhatsApp.  In  the  case  of  lim- ing, a spirit of egalitarianism and inclusion is  important,  so WhatsApp’s  group  chat  func- tion affords each member of the group to be a  potentially equal participant in the conversa- tion. The  second  significant  contribution  of  polymedia  as  a  theory  is  that  it  emphasises  content and how people also choose media to  communicate particular messages, for exam- ple,  why  breaking  up  with  a  partner  would  be more appropriately done face to face than  by text message. As a social theory of media  grounded within ethnographic inquiry, Miller  and Madianou’s concept of polymedia com- pliments  theories  of  relationships  between  media  platforms  proposed  previously  by  a  number  of  other  scholars  from  a  range  of  disciplines  outside  anthropology.  Media  multiplexity  theory   Haythornthwaite  and  Wellman, 1998  and media ecologies  Fuller,  2005  are two notable examples. Polymedia  may  be  distinctive  in  the  way  that  it  fore- grounds the qualities of social relationships,  which lends it to being used as a framework  for making sense of ethnographic data.  There  were  clear  implications  and  con- sequences  for  choosing  which  platform  to  communicate  certain  content  to  particular  people. In Trinidad, the more dyadic nature  of  communication  on  WhatsApp  made  it  more  acceptable  to  conduct  serious  conver- sations  over  text  on  occasions  where  the  other  person  was  unable  to  speak  owing  to  being  in  the  company  of  others.  Although  a  voice  call,  a  video  call,  or  face-to-face  conversation  was  often  described  as  being  preferable  to  text,  WhatsApp  was  viewed  as  a  more  acceptable  text-based  service  for  private  and  intimate  conversations  than    186  Facebook  Messenger.  WhatsApp  was  also  understood  in  relation  to  its  predecessor,  BBM   BlackBerry  Messenger .  BlackBerry  was  arguably  the  first  multimedia  form  of  communication  over  a  hand-held  device  for  many Trinidadians,  and  when  it  declined  in  popularity Trinidadians were quick to adopt  WhatsApp,  which  offered  similar  functions  but could be used on many different brands  of phones.  The configuration of media was also influ- enced  by  how  participants  viewed  ‘public’  and ‘private’. Over the duration of Sinanan’s  fieldwork, she observed an increase in closed,  small-group  chats  between  friends  or  fam- ily members on WhatsApp, which resonates  with modes of socialising that were already  widespread  in  Trinidadian  society.  The  Trinidadian term ‘liming’ has a similar mean- ing to ‘hanging out’, but liming is considered  integral to social life. Previously, liming was  a predominantly male public activity, where  men  would  lime  in  rum  shops  or  on  street  corners, talking about politics and comment- ing  on   or  to   women  passing  by   Eriksen,  1990; Lieber, 1976 . Today, men and women  lime in both gendered and mixed groups, in  homes,  bars  or  more  up-market  clubs.  On  weekends, extended family or groups might  lime  at  the  beach  or  river.  Several  young  men  emphasised  drinking  as  central  to  lim- ing,  but  many  enjoy  liming  for  the  sake  of  sharing  company  and  relaxing  without  any  impositions. Liming is also characterised by  shows  of  bravado  and  performative  banter  for  the  entertainment  of  peers  and  was  his- torically associated with street culture, which  emphasises style and appearance to enhance  a  person’s  reputation   Burton,  1997;  Miller,  1994a .  The  importance  placed  on  appear- ance  as  defining  a  person  takes  on  specific  cultural importance in Trinidad, where indi- viduals  often  emphasise  character  as  resid- ing  on  the  surface  of  an  individual  rather  than  ‘deep  within’   Miller,  1994b .  In  this  context,  it  is  perhaps  unsurprising  that  we  found that people in the Trinidadian field site  tend to post more images to Facebook, with   an average of 732 per person, than those in  the English field site, for example, where the  average is 450 per person.  Liming materialises through images of eat- ing and drinking together or of empty alco- hol bottles on Facebook, and it also appears  through  banter  over WhatsApp.  The  impor- tance of humour in Trinidad, and the ability  to  make  others  laugh,  demonstrates  a  form  of  social  inclusion  achieved  through  shar- ing common references and experiences and  reinforcing  group  norms  as  a  form  of  eve- ryday  play   Eriksen,  1990;  Lieber,  1976 .  Closed groups of extended family or friends  on  WhatsApp  form  a  space  where  dynam- ics  of  liming  are  replicated  through  sharing  banter,  jokes,  humorous  memes  and  images  from  pop  culture,  and  links  to  videos  as  a  form  of  time  spent  together  and  bonding.  One  of  the  reasons  for  the  greater  popular- ity of group chats on WhatsApp compared to  Facebook Messenger is because participants  felt  WhatsApp  afforded  them  greater  con- trol  over  who  saw  specific  content.  In  this  example,  we  can  thus  see  how  ethnography  of social media therefore does not set out to  study how a particular platform is used, but,  rather,  starts  with  the  field  site  and  studies  the platforms that are used within the context  of  social  relationships  in  that  place.  Social  relationships  also  influence  the  relationship  to  social  media  platforms  and  ethnographic  research can then show how a platform can  be localised rather than ‘exported’. Such an  approach  takes  a  greater  interest  in  content  than the platform itself and emphasises that  the norms and values they reveal are neither  uniform nor universal.  Polymedia is a salient example of a theory  of media that has been informed through the  use  of  particular  methods,  illustrating  how  unique  insight  emerges  from  shifting  the  focus away from group or community forma- tion, and instead towards specific practices or  socialities. By considering the significance of  liming  and  its  inflections  prior  to  the  intro- duction of social media, Sinanan’s case also  confirms  Coleman’s   2010   assertion  of  the    ethnograPhy  187  value of the process of ethnography for gain- ing  detailed  insights  into  the  broader  sig- nificance  of  digital  media.  Coleman  argues  that the ethnographic enterprise significantly  contributes  to  digital  media  studies,  as  eth- nography  involves  different  frames  of  anal- yses,  drawing  attention  to  history  and  local  contexts and the lived experiences that result  from  such  contexts   2010:  488–489 .  The  more abstract points of polymedia therefore  become  particularly  concrete  in  Sinanan’s  comparison  of  how  particular  relationships  correlated  to  particular  forms  of  platform  use  within  the  Trinidadian  social  context,  something  that  could  only  have  been  eluci- dated through ethnography. Relationships of  trust and, ideally, long periods of immersion  within people’s everyday lives are beneficial  for understanding uses of social media such  as  WhatsApp,  which  affords  more  dyadic  communication  between  individuals  and  closed groups.  social media and The  eThnographic producT  Throughout anthropology as a discipline, the  relative weightings of three elements of eth- nographic writing – ethnography, context and  comparison – have shifted. Some of the earli- est developments in ethnography came from  Morgan  1851 [1962] , who aimed to depict  the  structure  of  society  from  his  research  participants’  viewpoints  in  his  writing.  This  was  later  bolstered  by  deeper  ethnographic  engagement  which  followed  as  researchers  started  learning  their  informants’  languages   for  example,  Cushing  1883  [1988],  1920 .  Boas’s  1888 [1964]  development of cultural  anthropology in the US, guided by desires to  ‘salvage’ cultures viewed under threat of dis- appearance,  emphasised  comparison  over  ethnographic description. Drastic reformula- tion accompanied Malinowski’s  1922  work,  which  stressed  active  ethnographic  engage- ment in participants’ lives while also paying   increased attention to the contextual element  through  charting  linkages  between  suppos- edly  separate  domains,  such  as  economics  and magic. Evans-Pritchard’s  1940  ethnog- raphy of the Nuer extended this by utilising  vivid  ethnographic  accounts,  to  the  extent  that  his  work  remains  widely  influential  in  anthropology today.  Traditionally,  ethnography  within  anthro- pology is most commonly described as par- ticipant  observation,  although  where  this  takes  place  has  increasingly  come  under  question.  For  Geertz   1973 ,  ethnography  defined anthropology in practice. He said that  ‘Anthropologists don’t study villages  tribes,  towns, neighbourhoods… ; they study in vil- lages’   1973:  22 .  Comaroff  and  Comaroff   2003: 151  bring into question the produc- tion of place, and the definition and bounda- ries of the field, as they argue that the local  and global are now inseparable. The question  of what constitutes place is an issue brought  into sharp focus as a result of social media’s  presence,  as  people  use  these  platforms  to  maintain  both  localised  and  transnational  family relationships and friendships, as well  as potentially expanding their own networks.  Indeed,  with  the  ubiquity  of  social  media,  where media stories, news and images from  popular  culture  are  circulated  by  users  at  a  frequency comparable to that of direct mes- sages  between  individuals,  what  constitutes  ‘global’ and ‘local’ is increasingly problema- tised.  In  the  1990s,  anthropological  debates  were  concerned  with  the  influence  of  eco- nomic globalisation and transnational media  flows on the apparent reduction of the ‘local’   Marcus, 1995 . Ethnographic studies carried  out towards the end of the twentieth century  sought  to  understand  whether  global  influ- ences  were  making  societies  more  homog- enous  Foster, 1991, 1999; Wilk, 1995 .  The ubiquity of social media has increased  concerns  with  cultural  homogenisation,  but  ethnographic  research  provides  substantial  comparative evidence that different societies  appropriate social media into localised social  norms,  uses  and  meanings   Miller,  2011;     188  Miller  et  al.,  2016 .  Viewing  social  media  through  ethnography  complements  research  which  associates  social  media  with  indi- vidualism,  self-expression  and  ego-centred  networking   Rainie  and  Wellman,  2012 .  Ethnography  highlights  issues  of  culture  while  remaining  sceptical  of  both  cultural  and technological determinism.  The small selection of pivotal ethnographic  texts discussed above are foundational read- ing in anthropology, and have thus spawned  a multitude of further ethnographic research  and writings, all of which have had to nego- tiate and merge these issues of ethnography,  comparison and contextualisation.  Downloadable Digital  Ethnography  Despite  the  various  reconfigurations  of  the  internal  balance  of  ethnographic  writings  over the decades, the forms of research prod- ucts  have  largely  remained  constant:  pub- lished  ethnographic  monographs  and  academic journal articles. While digital pub- lishing,  e-books  and  online  journals  have  changed how many people access this litera- ture,  the  intended  audience  often  remains  much  the  same.  Although  steps  have  been  taken to remove financial and technical bar- riers to accessing these publications, such as  the welcome growth of open access publica- tions  within  anthropology   Weiss,  2014 ,  anthropologists  have  primarily  emphasised  maintaining   or  even  extending   the  rigour  and  high  academic  standards  of  peer- reviewed  ethnographic  publications   Miller,  2012: 398 , rather than enabling complimen- tary or alternative forms of scholarship.  The  Why  We  Post  project  is  attempting  to  challenge  the  ‘traditional’  ethnographic  monograph  as  the  main  product  of  anthro- pological  research.  First,  we  committed  to  publish all of our monographs  Costa, 2016;  Haynes,  2016;  McDonald,  2016;  Miller,  2016; Nicolescu, 2016; Sinanan, 2017; Spyer,  2017;  Venkatraman,  2017;  Wang,  2016   in   an  open-access  format  through  a  leading  academic  publisher.  This  meant  that  they  would be free to download by anyone in the  world with an internet connection. Our own  experience  of  conducting  research  in  small  towns in countries such as Brazil, India and  China underlined the difficulties many have  in  accessing  books  and  other  educational  resources.  However, our experiences showed us that  simply providing access to the final ethno- graphic text was not enough. Merely being  able to download a book free of charge does  not  necessarily  equate  to  people  wanting  to  download  it  or  subsequently  read  it.  To  address this, we realised that we also had to  change  the  form  of  the  ethnographic  prod- uct.  For  example,  although  the  finished  volumes  are  scholarly  academic  texts,  we  adopted  an  accessible  and  open  style  of  writing, so that they could be understood by  the genral public. We adopted a format that  has more in common with historical writing  than  traditional  anthropology,  and  decided  to confine discussion of wider theory, aca- demic issues and citations to endnotes. This  means that reading the main body text pro- vides  the  reader  with  a  clear  narrative  of  our  findings,  largely  concentrating  on  the  field site itself. For those who desire a more  conventional  academic  book,  the  endnotes  relate  the  evidence  from  each  field  site  to  the broader academic context and theoreti- cal debates.  The  methodological  discussions  around  digital  ethnography  provide  added  insight  into  how  digital  ethnography,  as  a  product,  may  be  refined  to  reflect  the  actualities  of  people’s  everyday  engagement  with  media  forms.  This  methodological  focus  on  what  is  taken  for  granted  or  perceived  as  normal  in digital practices  Pink et al., 2016  neces- sitates an acknowledgement of the way that  individuals  perceive  lived  experience  as  entanglements,  where  aspects  of  life  do  not  exist  in  separate  categories   Ingold,  2008 .  Just  as  the  subjects  of  ethnographies  can  no  longer  be  caricatured  as  isolated  social    ethnograPhy  189  groups,  those  producing  ethnography  must  also acknowledge that their readers  or audi- ence  possess similarly complex and multiva- lent social lives. We argue, therefore, that any  discussion of ethnography and social media  must also rightfully consider the possibilities  and challenges posed by new and alternative  forms  of  ethnography,  such  as  open-access  publishing,  filmmaking,  and  disseminat- ing  research  findings  and  insights  on  social  media platforms themselves.  Can A ‘Tweet’ be Ethnographic?  Above, we outlined a new format for ethno- graphic  monographs  that  retains  academic  and theoretical rigour while focusing on spe- cific results from a given field site. This is a  small  step  towards  making  ethnographic  research  accessible  to  a  larger  audience.  However, although this form emerged out of  our  ethnographic  study  of  social  media,  it  does not make use of social media itself.  Arguably, this a key area in which social  media  and  ethnography  are  converging.  Social media are an increasingly acceptable  outlet for ethnographic writing, and in turn, a  new ethnographic product. Researchers have  shown  willingness  to  use  social  media5  to  promote their own work and engage in theo- retical  and  disciplinary  discussion   Price,  2010 .  Anthropological  organisations  such  as the American Anthropological Association  and  Hau:  The  Journal  of  Anthropological  Theory  are  exemplary  cases,  with  followers  numbering in the tens of thousands. However,  perhaps  more  interesting  is  how  individual  researchers are using social media, and how  these  platforms  are  used  to  share  ongoing  ethnographic reflections and embryonic the- oretical ideas over the course of fieldwork.  This  use  of  social  media  as  an  ethno- graphic product has transformed the process  of  reviewing  field  notes  from  a  primarily  internal  and  reflective  stance  to  one  that  is  potentially  far  more  outwardly-directed  and  collaborative  in  nature.  Social  media   challenges  the  notion  that  there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  ‘final’  ethnographic  product.  Instead,  readers  of  a  finished  monograph  may have followed the author’s research pro- ject  from  afar  for  several  years. Writing  on  the  increasingly  collaborative  nature  of  the  internet at the height of the ‘Web 2.0’ para- digm almost ten years ago, Bruns argued that  ‘the role of the “consumer” and even that of  the “end user” have long disappeared, and the  distinctions between producers and users of  content  have  faded  into  comparative  insig- nificance’   Bruns,  2008:  2 .  While  Bruns’  argument  can  be  critiqued  by  arguing  that   such collaborative, open-ended production by   users  is  in  fact  symptomatic  of  exploitative  relationships  between  users  and  platform  owners, we find the concept remains useful in   understanding how the role of the ‘producer- ethnographer’  and  ‘consumer-reader’  may  become  increasingly  muddied  once  the  researcher  starts  sharing  their  research  pro- ject on social media.  Ethnographic  social  media  postings  are  often less polished and theoretical than peer- reviewed books and articles, but it is often the  untreated nature of these online ethnographic  field  notes-cum-realisations  that  makes  them  especially  compelling. As  such,  these  forms of ethnographic product challenge the  implicit  contradiction  between  the  suppos- edly  ‘thick’  nature  of  ethnographic  descrip- tion   Geertz,  1973   and  a  persistent  public  discourse which maintains that online forms  of communication are, by nature, lacking in  profundity and meaning.  A decade ago, Jenkins  2006: 18  argued  that ‘convergence requires media companies  to rethink assumptions about what it means  to  consume  media,  assumptions  that  shape  both programming and marketing decisions’.  The  same  is  true  for  ethnographers.  The  authors  have  directly  experienced  the  ben- efits of using social media as an ethnographic  product  through  a  website,  blog  and  social  media profiles which were set up and main- tained throughout their project. Social media  postings  related  to  the  ongoing  fieldwork    190  added a reflexive, open aspect to the research  process, and resulted in interest and feedback  from  fellow  researchers  and  the  wider  pub- lic. Our blog resulted in invitations to present  at conferences and workshops, to contribute  articles  regarding  research  to  other  outlets,  among other benefits.  The ethnographic slant of our own research  was  complemented  by  a  strong  emphasis  on  social  media’s  materiality  –  the  physical  nature  of  these  platforms  and  their  content,  understood within the context of their social  use. For instance, we paid careful attention to  the increasingly visual nature of social media  in  each  of  our  field  sites.  Our  project  dedi- cated an entire month solely to the study of  our  participants’  social  media  profiles,  sys- tematically  counting,  analysing  and  catego- rising their postings  including status updates,  shared  images  and  video   across  a  range  of  platforms   including  Facebook,  Twitter,   QQ  and  WeChat,  depending  on  what  was  used  by  participants  in  each  site . Although  this approach may appear to represent some- thing of a departure from the ‘active engage- ment’  in  our  participants’  everyday  lives,  which  ethnographic  practice  is  supposed  to  typify,  the  majority  of  our  researchers  bal- anced this by remaining in the field site for  the  entire  month  in  which  they  carried  out  this  screen-based  analysis.  This  meant  that  even during this period it was inevitable that  we, as researchers, would encounter in social  settings the very participants whose profiles  we  had  been  closely  analysing  with  respect  to the social media updates, affording a valu- able opportunity to obtain narrative accounts  of  the  context  in  which  such  postings  had  been made.  The  result  of  this  approach  became  clear  in  the  case  of  baby  photographs  observed  on social media in McDonald’s field site. As  McDonald  systematically  analysed  the  QQ    a  popular  social  media  platform  in  China   postings – a total of 1,214 postings from 55  participants  –  he  gradually  became  aware  of  the  prevalence  of  photos  of  participants’  young children, especially babies, shared on   their QQ profiles. Before his systematic anal- ysis was even complete, he began taking time  in the evening to talk to the parents of these  children about their rationale and motive for  posting  so  many  baby  photos.  McDonald  was  able  to  identify  two  distinct  periods  in  the production of these baby photos: the first,  self-produced photos that are taken by moth- ers and posted on social media to alleviate the  boredom of the traditional ‘sitting the month’  period,  where  mothers  are  confined  to  the  home with their newborn child; the second,  a  series  of  professionally  produced  baby  photos that are taken when the child reaches  a  hundred  days  of  age,  and  are  then  subse- quently made into both a printed photo album  and shared on social media.  Far  from  just  considering  these  photos,  their  circulation  online,  and  the  subsequent  implications  of  their  sharing,  being  situated  in the field site allowed him to examine how  social media was changing the production of  these  images.  McDonald  spoke  to  the  man- agers of several of the town’s photo studios  which  specialised  in  offering  this  service,  and  started  to  understand  that  parents  were  so keen to upload the resultant hundred-day  baby photos that photo studios were offering  the uploading service within the studio itself,  immediately  after  the  initial  photographs  were taken. Furthermore, conversations with  photo studio managers enabled him to under- stand how sharing these images on QQ repre- sented the latest stage in the development of  this photographic tradition, which had trans- formed  over  several  decades  following  the  introduction of photography in the town, and  was also built upon a longer established tra- dition of banquets and gifting red envelopes  filled with money to celebrate a child reach- ing his or her hundredth day.  In  addition  to  charting  the  practice’s  his- torical roots, this focus on the social context  of these images as material artefacts allowed  for  an  understanding  of  how  the  practice  related  to  conceptions  of  the  future.  Many  ‘successful’  photo  albums  included  photo- graphs with a wide variety of different poses,    ethnograPhy  191  facial expressions, outfits and props. Parents  and  photo  studio  managers  explained  that  this variety was seen to reflect abundance and  wealth and a desire to avoid monotony. This  stood in contrast to baby photographs in the  town taken in the 1970s, where most families  were able to afford only a single black-and- white photograph. The increasing variety and  complexity of photographic images reflected  not  only  a  desire  to  express  their  current  wealth, but also an aspiration to bestow a cer- tain material abundance upon their children.  The images were also intended to serve as a  record  of  parents’  generosity  towards  their  offspring at an early age, to be reviewed by  these children when they reached adulthood,  and  contributing  to  informing  traditional  Chinese  notions  of  parent–child  reciprocity   see Stafford, 2000 .  Despite being a single example, the case of  baby photos shared on social media in China  does demonstrate how a specific focus on the  material content of postings, and systematic  analysis  thereof  in  light  of  their  associated  social context, can highlight seemingly mun- dane aspects of social media  that neverthe- less  tend  to  dominate  participants’  online  activities ,  which,  when  subsequently  com- bined  with  focused  ethnographic  research,  illuminate  the  far-reaching  effects  of  these  practices:  how  they  relate  and  contribute  to  the  historical,  economic,  consumptive  and  material  changes  of  people’s  lives.  In  this  case, social media ethnography has to make  sense  of  particular  actions  around  social  media  within  a  much  broader  context  of  ongoing  social  transformation  and  how  this  interacts  with  people’s  own  memories,  con- cerns, morality, desires and aspirations.  However, this case gives us more than sim- ply ethnographic insight. The postings studied  in the course of the visual analysis are more  than just objects to think with. They have also  formed  an  integral  part  of  the  ethnographic  findings  of  this  project.  The  images  that  parents  have  shared  online  are  reproduced   with  their  consent   in  McDonald’s   2016   monograph.  With  the  help  of  a  filmmaker,   McDonald  produced  a  short  documentary  film about the photographic practice of tak- ing photos to celebrate a baby reaching a hun- dred days, which included an interview with  a  photo  studio  owner  and  a  parent,  as  well  as examples of these postings shared online.  The  resultant  film6  is  shared  on  the  pro- ject’s  YouTube  channel,7  along  with  others  from his field site. The implications of these  baby photos were also discussed in the pro- ject’s blog.8 Although the traditions of using  imagery to complement text in monographs,  and the wider subdiscipline of visual anthro- pology are now well established, these kinds  of social media postings and imagery provide  a new feeling of presence in the field. They  not  only  have  an  ‘authenticating’  quality,  confirming to the audience that what is being  spoken  about  actually  exists,  but  they  also  invite  viewers  take  part  in  a  deeper,  critical  engagement with these reproduced artefacts,  critically  assessing  the  author’s  explanation  of the item against their original account.  The case of baby photos on Chinese social  media  is  perhaps  most  surprising  because  it  demonstrates  the  new  circularity  that  social  media has brought to the ethnographic form.  Photographs  that  were  originally  produced  with  the  intention  of  being  shared  on  social  media are subsequently analysed in an attempt  to  understand  how  people  use  social  media,  and in addition to appearing in an ethnographic  monograph,  they  subsequently  become  the  subject of a documentary film which is shared  and commented on upon social media. As the  written  ethnographic  monograph  becomes  increasingly  embedded  in  an  environment  of ‘media convergence’  Jenkins, 2006 , it is  inevitable that the ethnographic ‘product’ will  take on new and challenging forms.  conclusion: WhaT does social  media mean for eThnography?  Throughout  this  chapter  we  have  seen  how  the  ethnographic  process  and  product  are    192  affected by the presence of social media. As  social media become increasingly entangled  in  the  daily  lives  of  research  participants,  they  become  a  mode  through  which  many  foundational themes in anthropology can be  examined.  This  shift  speaks  to  a  broader  change of methodological focus in relation to  studies of social media, moving from studies  of  community  formation  to  more  ‘action’- based analysis detailing how sociality, prac- tice  and  mobility  are  being  reshaped  by  social  media.  Polymedia,  for  example,  emerged from modes of analysis which con- centrated  on  the  sociality  associated  with  different platforms, and different practices of  social media use.  In  the  second  part  of  this  chapter,  we  examined the changing nature of the ethno- graphic product, showing how social media  has  contributed  to  the  latest  phase  in  over  a  century’s  worth  of  shifting  in  the  actual  form  of  ethnographic  product.  We  argued  for  acknowledgement  of  social  media  itself  as  a  venue  for  a  new  type  of  ethnographic  output,  detailing  how  social  media  became  an  important  venue  for  sharing  our  eth- nographic  experience  and  knowledge.  To  illustrate  this,  we  turned  to  the  example  of  Chinese baby photos, which highlighted the  circularity of social media postings that were  at  once  the  focus  of  ethnographic  inquiry,  but which subsequently appeared as part of  our ethnographic product in monographs and  articles,  but  also  on  social  media  itself  in  the form of blog posts, YouTube videos and  social media posts.  Ingold  2014  has recently highlighted the  increasingly widespread use of the term ‘eth- nography’, both within anthropology and its  allied disciplines, claiming that the term has  become so common that it has lost much of  its meaning. He argues that our understand- ing  of  what  constitutes  ethnography  ought  to  be  confined  to   largely  written   attempts  to ‘chronicle the life and times of a people’   2014:  384 .  Ingold  asserts  that  encounters  with  people,  fieldwork,  methods,  and  the  knowledge  emerging  from  these  activities,   should  not  be  regarded  as  ethnographic.  Instead, he argues that many of these activi- ties should simply be routinely referred to as  participant observation. He stresses that par- ticipant observation involves the exploration  of the human condition, rather than describ- ing people’s points of view or life world, and  the possibilities of being human.  Ingold’s  positioning  of  anthropology  –  rather than ethnography – as a ‘practice’ or  a  type  of  exposure,  and  an  exploration  of  humanness, is certainly an appealing one. We  also sympathise with his concerns regarding  the  widespread  appropriation  of  the  use  of  the  term  ‘ethnography’  both  within  anthro- pology and elsewhere, ourselves noting that  such  use  is  extending  to  many  settings  out- side  academia,  including  by  corporations  in  commercial settings  for example, Elliott and  Jankel-Elliott, 2003; Thrift, 2006: 295 .  We  argue  that  anthropology’s  preserva- tion is more likely to come from embracing,  rather than resisting, the expansive nature of  ethnography. This has been made especially  clear  through  this  chapter’s  examination  of  the  relationship  between  ethnography  and  social media. The ubiquitous nature of social  media  means  that  they  will  be  an  essential  tool  for  fieldworkers  in  nearly  every  envi- ronment  regardless  of  their  research  site  or  theme.  Social  media  and  ethnography  are  already deeply embedded in one another, and  will only become more so in the future. This  process is not expected to be an easy one, as  many  of  the  changes  that  would  be  bought  upon  both  the  ethnographic  process  and  product  pose  fundamental  challenges  to  the  way in which knowledge is constructed, the  authority of the anthropologist, and the state  of  relations  between  the  ethnographer,  par- ticipants and readers. However, it is precisely  for this reason, that rising to the challenge of  a new social media-oriented ethnography has  the  potential  to  reinvigorate  social  science  research  more  broadly,  bringing  it  closer  to  the  people  they  study  both  in  the  course  of  fieldwork and in the production and dissemi- nation of knowledge.   ethnograPhy  193  Notes   1   www.ucl.ac.uk why-we-post  2   This  project  was  funded  by  the  European  Research Council  Grant number SOCNET Project  2011-AdG-295486 .   3   China  had  two  field  sites,  to  account  for  the  specificity of the country’s distinctive social media  platforms.   4   Madianou and Miller  2013  argue that polyme- dia can be said to apply in any given situation so  long as access to different kinds of digital media  are not majorly constrained by cost and usability.  5   Blogs  have  been  included  in  this  definition  because of their ‘social’ commenting feature, but  also because they frequently draw on online work.   6   http:  youtu.be _BQE1m1DQk8  7   www.youtube.com whywepost  8   http:  blogs.ucl.ac.uk global-social-media 2013   11 19 qq-and-nationalism-is-qq-uniting-the-  many-different-chinas   references  Acquisti,  A.  and  Gross,  R.   2006 .

On  the  one  hand,  online  social  media  predate  the  Web.  Online  social  activity  took  place  in  Newsgroups  and  Bulletin  Board  Systems  as  early as the 1980s, and not only did these pre- Web  social  media  fuel  an  understanding  in  the  general  public  of  what  it  meant  to  ‘be  social’ online with people on the other side of  the globe, these early forms of online social  media also continued to develop on the World  Wide Web once it was established, and in this  new  medium  they  found  their  role  in  the  emerging Web ecosystem, alongside all other  use forms of the Web, including commercial,  political, and civic use. On the other hand, the  advent  of Web  2.0  technologies  in  the  early  2000s, and their extensive use in the develop- ment  of  social  media  platforms  and  compa- nies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube,   have had a great impact on the development  of the Web in general, for instance regarding  the rapid spread of technologies used for con- tent  syndication  such  as  RSS  and  practices  like microblogging, which can be found not  only  on  dedicated  microblogging  services,  but  have  become  widespread  on  the Web  in  general.  Thus,  if  one  wants  to  fully  under- stand how Web and social media have become  what they are, it is necessary to include their  intertwined genealogies.  As  any  other  digital  media  type  the Web  comes with two layers: on the one hand, the  software  code  and  the  digital  text  treated  by the software, and, on the other hand, the  semantic  elements  we  see  on  a  computer  screen,  such  as  writing,  images  and  video.  The first layer is not understandable as such  for the end user who reads a text or watches  a  video,  but  nevertheless  it  constitutes  the  condition for the manifest text since what is  shown in a browser is created from the HTML  code. Thus, when studying the Web focus can  either  be  on  HTML  code,  hyperlinks,  and    web history and soCial Media  197  the  entire  digital  ecosystem  of  the  web,  or  on  whatever  is  presented  to  the  user  on  the  screen – or on the relation between the two.  It is also worth noting that although the Web  code is not proprietary in itself, it allows for  the creation of proprietary social media plat- forms that enables the creation of walled gar- dens on the Web.  However, studying the history of the Web  more generally, before we even get to Web- based  social  media,  can  be  a  challenging  task, in particular because Web content disap- pears rapidly, and therefore the archived Web  becomes  an  important  source.  This  chapter  will  discuss  some  of  the  particular  meth- odological  challenges  related  to  the  use  of  archived  Web  sources  when  studying  social  media on the Web of the past. First, the gen- eral  characteristics  of  the  archived Web  and  the  consequences  of  these  for  its  scholarly  use are identified. Then attention is drawn to  the specific challenges of the archived social  media on the Web, followed by examples of  how historical studies of social Web media are  challenged when using archived Web sources.  And, finally, future challenges are outlined.1  Web hisTory – WhaT is   The difference?  The history of the internet has been studied  for  more  than  two  decades   e.g.,  Abbate,  2000; Goggin, 2004; Goggin & McLelland,  2017;  Hauben  &  Hauben,  1997;  Naughton,  1999, 2012; Poole, 2005 . However, much of  the existing literature is about the internet in  general, and not about the Web. If one wants  to limit the scope to the Web, as is the case in  this  chapter,  there  exist  only  a  few  books  about  Web  historiography   e.g.,  Brügger,  2010;  Brügger  &  Burns,  2012;  Gillies  &  Cailliau, 2000 , but Web history constitutes a  fast-growing field of study to which a number  of forthcoming volumes attest  e.g., Brügger,  2017; Brügger & Milligan, 2018; Brügger &  Schroeder, 2017 .  This chapter is based on two meanings of  the term ‘Web history’. On the one hand, it  can refer to the use of the Web of the past as  a source in any kind of historical study and,  on the other hand, it can refer to the study of  the history of the Web itself  where the Web  can also be a source . In other words, one can  distinguish between writing history with the  Web and writing histories of the Web.  In  most  respects  Web  historiography  is  no different from any other kind of histori- cal  study.  The  fundamental  issues  of  his- toriography  also  apply  for  Web  history   in  both  of  the  two  senses  outlined  above ,  be  they questions related to interpretation of the  source material, to disciplines that can help  the  historical  study,  to  theories  of  history,  to  periodization,  to  which  forces  drive  his- tory, as well as to general questions related  to  the  source  material:  How,  where  and  in  what condition do we find it? Are the sources  valid? Are they representative? Are they pri- mary or secondary?  As with all types of historical studies, the  nature  and  extent  of  available  source  mate- rial  has  a  strong  impact  on  which  histories  can be written. Histories of social media on  the Web can be based on a variety of source  types, from diaries, photos, and news stories  to retrospective interviews, user statistics, log  files, as well as studies of the Web and social  media  conducted  in  the  past.  However,  the  Web itself constitutes one of the most impor- tant sources, since it is the prime source for  documenting  what  happened  on  the  Web,  what social media websites looked like, and  which forms of interaction they allowed for.  The problem with the Web is its ephemeral- ity:  content  is  frequently  either  updated  or  removed permanently, and layout, design and  forms  of  interaction  are  changing  rapidly.  After just a short period, the Web of the past  is  likely  to  have  disappeared,  and  it  is  only  available if it has been archived. An illustra- tive  example  of  a  permanent  disappearance  of an important part of the Web is the deci- sion  by  Yahoo  in  2009  to  close  GeoCities  and delete all user content; GeoCities partly    198  survived in archived form only because of the  effort made by the Archive Team, an archiv- ing  collective,  and  by  the  Internet  Archive   Milligan, 2017 .  However, as will be shown in the follow- ing  section,  the  archived  Web  is  a  specific  kind  of  historical  source,  and  therefore  it  comes  with  a  set  of  specific  challenges.2  Insofar  as  social  media  are  part  of  the  Web,  they  inherit  the  characteristics  of  the  archived  Web,  including  the  array  of  chal- lenges.  But  archived  social  media  on  the  Web  come  with  additional  challenges  of  their own. First, the content on social media  platforms is very often updated at an unprec- edented pace, second, social media content  is  also  often  difficult  to  access  because  it  is  fenced-off,  and,  third,  social  media  plat- forms often constitute very integrated digital  media environments.  archived Web as a source  For  a  scholar  who  wants  to  understand  the  history of social media in the future, the all- important challenge is that in most cases the  Web of the past has disappeared.3 Although  other  source  types,  such  as  the  ones  men- tioned  above   e.g.,  diaries,  photos,  or  user  statistics , may be useful, they cannot docu- ment the Web in the same manner as can the  Web  of  the  past  itself.  Therefore,  scholars  must hope that they are able to find versions  of the Web that have been preserved, either  by  cultural  heritage  institutions,  such  as  national  or  trans-national  Web  archives,  by  researchers, or on the online Web itself. But  finding preserved Web material is only half a  victory, because the form in which the Web  was collected and preserved determines how  it  may  be  used  as  an  object  of  study.  Therefore, it is relevant to know more about  some of the ways in which the Web can be  preserved,  and  how  each  of  these  ways  affects  the  possible  studies  to  be  conducted  based on the material.4  From Online Web to   Archived Web  Web  archiving  can  be  understood  as  ‘any  form of deliberate and purposive preserving  of web material’  Brügger, 2011b, p. 25 . On  a  general  level,  two  approaches  to  Web  archiving  can  be  identified   Brügger,  2005,   p. 10 . On the one hand, there is macro Web  archiving:  Web  archiving  carried  out  by   trans- national institutions with the remit of  preserving the cultural heritage; and, on the  other  hand,  micro  archiving: Web  archiving  performed by a scholar or a group of schol- ars, for instance, with the aim of preserving  the Web for scholarly purposes; or by anyone  wanting  to  preserve  the  Web  for  whatever  reason. In the main, macro Web archiving is  carried out by professionals on a large scale,  whereas micro Web archiving is carried out  on a small scale by people with more limited  technical  knowledge.  This  distinction  is  important  since  knowledge  about  who  pre- served the Web, for what purpose, and how,  may have an impact on how useful it is as a  source as well as where to look for it.  The most important thing to have in mind  when  using  the  archived  Web  for  historical  studies  is  that  for  a  number  of  reasons  the  archived Web  is  not  necessarily  identical  to  what  was  online  at  a  certain  point  in  time.  On the contrary, it is better understood as an  actively  created  and  subjective  reconstruc- tion – that is, a version and not a copy. The  reason for this is that it is not straightforward  just to make a copy of the online Web, simply  because this can be done in a number of very  different ways, depending on which strategy  for the archiving is adopted  e.g., where and  when the archiving should start stop , which  choices  are  made  on  a  more  detailed  level  about how the archiving should be performed   e.g.,  in- exclusion  of  specific  file  types,  number  of  hyperlinks  to  follow,  accessing  other  Web  servers ,  and  how  the  archiving  of the Web actually unfolds  often involving  technical  problems,  and  challenged  by  the  dynamics of updating .5   web history and soCial Media  199  The Web  of  the  past  may  have  been  pre- served  in  one  of  the  following  three  ways:   a  screen shots and individual webpages in  a  static  form;   b   screen  movies  and  down- loaded  video audio;  or   c   crawled  web    cf. Brügger, 2005, p. 34 . In the main, macro  Web  archiving  is  based  on  Web  crawling,  whereas  micro  archiving  is  often  based  on  either one of the three types or on combinations.  Screen shots and individual  webpages in a static form Since the easiest way of capturing the Web is  either to make a screen shot or to preserve an  individual webpage in static form  Brügger,  2005, p. 47 , the Web of the past may have  been  preserved  in  this  form.  A  screen  shot  has  preserved  whatever  was  visible  on  the  computer  screen,  whereas  the  webpage  in  static  form  was  preserved  by  using  specific  software   a  program  or  a  browser  add-on   where a Web address  a URL  was inserted,  and  the  software  has  then  retrieved  the  HTML content to be found at the URL and  converted  it  to  a  static  version  of  the  web- page in question  typically a pdf file .  Although  the  result  is  the  same  in  both  cases,  namely  the  output  of  a  static  image  with no possibility of any kind of movement,  the  two  are  also  different.  In  the  first  case,  the parts of a webpage which were not vis- ible  on  the  screen  were  not  preserved,  and  no scrolling on the webpage is possible, but  as  many  open  windows  as  it  is  possible  to  have on the screen can have been preserved,  whereas  in  the  latter  case  the  webpage  is  preserved  in  its  integrity  and  allows  for  scrolling.  In  addition,  the  screen  shot  is  an  adequate  representation  of  what  the  screen  actually  looked  like,  whereas  the  pdf  file  may not be a perfect rendering of the web- page, especially if it is created with a print  to pdf command. Finally, the two approaches  also differ in that a screen shot does not have  clickable hyperlinks and it is not searchable,  whereas this is a possibility with a webpage  preserved as a pdf file.  Screen movie and downloaded  video audio The Web of the past can also be preserved in  the form of a screen movie or a downloaded  video audio.  A  screen  movie  is  a  filmed  record  of  what  took  place  on  the  screen    in  total  or  in  part    cf.  Brügger,  2005,   pp. 49–53 , whereas a downloaded video audio  is  moving  images  or  sound  in  the  form  of  video or audio files which have been part of  a  webpage   for  instance,  as  an  embedded  video . Screen movies have been used with a  view to preserving the interaction on a web- page  or  website,  to  preserving  several  parts  of  a  website  as  they  actually  looked  at  the  time  they  were  visited,  or  to  preserve  streamed  video,  whereas  the  downloaded  video audio  only  preserves  individual  ele- ments of a webpage, such as a video, and not  the  webpage  as  such.  Neither  of  the  two  modes  of  preservation  come  with  clickable  hyperlinks.  Crawled web Finally, the Web of the past can be found in  the form of crawled Web. Crawled Web was  archived by the use of Web crawling software  which contacted a Web server with a request  for  specific  URLs  from  which  the  content  was then downloaded as HTML or other file  types.  The  software  may  have  been  config- ured to identify and follow hyperlinks from  the  URL  in  question  and  archive  the  link  target,  and  this  process  can  be  repeated.   The result of the Web crawling process is a  compilation  of  HTML  and  other  files  from  the Web server, and they can be displayed in  a Web browser with clickable links and other  forms  of  interaction,  much  like  the  online  Web, either in a Web archive  if macro  or on  the user’s computer  if micro . Although Web  crawlers should retrieve everything from the  Web  server,  this  is  not  always  the  case.  Elements on a webpage are often not archived  for  technical  reasons,  including  interaction  based  on  java,  rapidly  updating  content   such  as  chat,  video audio   individual  files,    200  streamed , and flash, just to mention a few. In  addition, the crawling process does not nec- essarily go as planned. In contrast to the two  above mentioned forms of archiving, crawled  Web is searchable and clickable.  Consequences  As outlined above the same Web entity of the  past can have been preserved in a number of  different  ways,  each  of  which  has  created  their version of the same online Web entity,  and each of which in their way impacts how  the  sources  can  be  used  in  historical  schol- arly  studies.  In  short,  each  of  the  ways  the  Web  was  preserved  opens  up  their  range  of  possible  use  scenarios  where  some  types  of  study  are  made  possible  whereas  others  are  precluded.6  Screen shots and individual webpages in a  static form are very useful sources in research  projects  where  it  is  important  to  have  an  exact image of what a webpage looked like,  and  how  the  different  elements  of  expres- sion actually appeared and were placed. For  instance,  this  could  be  studies  of  the  visual  appearance  of  webpages,  such  as  graphic  design studies, or simply just studies where  it  is  important  to  document  or  illustrate  the  exact content on a webpage at a given point  in time. However, screen shots and webpages  in a static form are not very useful in studies  where  access  to  the  HTML  code   including  hyperlinks  is important, neither are they of  any help if video, audio or any types of inter- action on webpages are to be studied.  Screen-captured movies are useful sources  in research projects where it is important to  include the ‘look and feel’ of the Web as well  as  how  the  interaction  could  take  place,  or  research projects where it is important that a  rapidly changing content flow is documented,  for instance, a chat. Downloaded audiovisual  elements  are  very  important  for  any  study  with  a  focus  on  these  forms  of  expression.  For  instance,  this  could  be  studies  of  inter- action,  image,  sound,  or  live  streaming  in   contexts such as anthropological studies, usa- bility studies, or media studies. However, as   was the case with screen shots and individ- ual webpages, screen movies are not very useful  when access to the HTML code is demanded,  they are not searchable, and a screen movie  can  be  difficult  to  navigate,  because  it  fol- lows  the  movements  of  the  person  who  did  the  filming,  which  is  not  necessarily  the  way  the  person  viewing  the  movie  would  like to move around in the website. In addi- tion, downloaded audiovisual objects usually  retain no trace of the webpage on which they  were embedded or linked to or from, which  is why it can be a challenge to establish the  relationship between a given webpage and a  given audiovisual element.  Crawled  Web  is  an  excellent  source  in  research  projects  where  a  browsable  ver- sion  of  the Web  is  needed,  or  where  access  to the HTML code is important. For instance,   this  could  be  studies  where  the  exact  look  of  the  webpages  plays  a  minor  role,  where  missing  elements  are  less  important,  and  studies of the HTML code, including studies  of hyperlinks. But crawled Web also comes  with  a  number  of  shortcomings.  As  men- tioned  above,  elements  of  expression  and  functionalities  may  be  missing  in  crawled  Web  which  can  make  a  study  of  these  fea- tures impossible.7  Where to Find the Web   of the Past  The Web of the past can be found in several  places, each of which influences the possible  use of the material as a historical source.  Since the mid-1990s a number of profes- sional Web archives have been established, in  most cases with a view of preserving a cul- tural heritage, either on a national or a trans- national  scale.8  In  general,  these  archives  are  based  on  Web  crawling,  the  material  is  of  very  high  quality,  and  depending  on  the  archiving  strategies  the  material  can  be  quite  comprehensive.  However,  access    web history and soCial Media  201  restrictions  may  apply,  ranging  from  online  and  open  for  all   as  the  Internet Archive  or  the Portuguese Web Archive  to only acces- sible for researchers, either at a physical loca- tion  as the UK Web Archive  or online  as  the Danish Netarkivet . Other types of macro  Web  archiving  initiatives  are  professional  vendors  who  offer  Web  archiving  services  such  as  the  Internet  Archive’s  subscription  service  Archive-It,  or  the  Internet  Memory  Research’s Archivethe.Net. These companies  are usually crawl based, and they are used by  national Web archives as well as by research- ers,  universities,  museums,  institutions  and  companies,  in  the  main  by  anyone  with  an  interest in documenting the Web.  In  addition  to  these  professional  Web  archives,  which  are  all  based  on  a  macro  archiving  approach,  there  exists  an  array  of  micro archiving-based collections of yester- day’s  Web.  These  Web  collections  include,  on  the  one  hand,  collections  archived  by  researchers  in  relation  to  research  projects.  This material may have been archived by the  use  of  all  the  types  of Web  archiving  men- tioned in this chapter, and it is usually of high  quality  and  well  documented,  but  in  many  cases not publicly available, and since it was  archived  with  a  specific  research  project  in  mind it may be customized to such a degree  that it is not usable in other studies. And, on  the  other  hand,  micro  archived  collections  include  a  number  of  publicly  available  col- lections,  archived  by  ‘amateurs’,  with  no  explicit  cultural  heritage  obligations,  rang- ing  from  coherent  collections  such  as  The  Archive  Team  Geocities  Snapshot   www. archiveteam.org , or Common Crawl’s open  repository of Web crawl data  commoncrawl. org ,  both  using Web  crawling,  to  whatever  can  be  found  on  the  online Web,  either  old  Web that someone has put there for whatever  reason,  such  as  screen  shots  of  Facebook  pages or screen movies, or old material that  is simply still available on the Web  e.g., Tim  Berners-Lee’s  first  webpage .  The  coherent  collections  are  usually  of  high  quality  and  well  documented,  whereas  it  can  be  very   challenging  to  determine  the  provenance  of  material  found  on  the Web,  but  in  many  cases  this  material  is  the  only  source  avail- able  cf. the historical analysis of Facebook  as a media text in Brügger  2015 , made on  the basis of screen shots found on the Web .  Purposively Archived Web  To the scholar who wants to write Web his- tory,  including  the  Web  history  of  social  media, by including the Web of the past as a  source,  the  main  challenge  is  to  find  pre- served versions of the Web. It is very likely  that  either  no  material  is  available  or  only  partly relevant material can be found, and in  either case the next step is to weigh to what  extent the material makes it possible to per- form the desired research and to answer the  research  questions,  possibly  by  combining  several source types which in itself is a chal- lenge  cf. Brügger, 2005, pp. 40–41, 53–60 .  In  general,  what  was  archived,  and  how  it  was  archived,  is  a  function  of  the  purpose  identified  by  the  institution,  group  or  indi- vidual  initiating  the  archiving.  The  purpose  can be placed somewhere along a continuum  with  macro  archiving  at  the  one  end  and  micro  archiving  at  the  other  end.  National  and  trans-national Web  archives  archive  the  Web with the purpose of preserving the cul- tural  heritage,  which  implies  that  it  is  not  preserved  with  any  particular  use  in  mind   one size fits all , whereas the preserved Web  that can be found on the online Web is pre- served for no specific reason, which is why it  is unstructured and random. And in between  these two ends of the continuum we have the  micro  archiving  performed  by  researchers  with  a  view  to  being  used  in  a  specific  research project. In all three cases, the mate- rial  may  turn  out  to  be  of  limited  use.  Although  there  is  a  lot  of  material  to  be  found  in  the  first  case,  it  may  not  be  pre- served in exactly the form a scholar may later  have wanted it to be, whereas in the latter two  cases  the  material  may  prove  to  be  too    202  customized,  either  because  it  is  simply  archived and put online by anyone, or it was  archived to fit only the specific research pro- ject to which it was archived.  social media and archived Web  The  general  characteristics  of  the  archived  Web as a source also apply to social media on  the Web, but, as mentioned in the beginning  of  this  chapter,  social  media  raise  at  least  three specific issues: social media content is  very  rapidly  updated,  it  is  often  fenced  off,  and  it  is  often  integrated  in  larger  digital  media environments. These three characteris- tics also apply to the Web in general – web- pages have always been dynamic, password  protection as well as syndication and embed- dedness were invented before modern social  media – but they come in new extreme forms  with today’s social media, in part because of  the scale of social media usage, and thereby  because  of  the  amount  of  content  which  is  updated,  fenced  off,  or  syndicated  and  embedded. These three characteristics place  special demands on how social media on the  Web can be collected and preserved, and thus  how  they  can  be  found  and  used  later  by  a  historian  wanting  to  study  the  history  of  social  media  on  the  Web.  The  challenges  related to these three characteristics are elab- orated below, and in the following main sec- tion  it  is  discussed  how  they  affect  the  historiography  of  social  media  on  the Web,  with  Facebook,  Twitter  and  YouTube  as  illustration.  High-Speed Updating and APIs  If  one  wants  to  write  a  history  of,  for  instance,  a  Facebook  page  where  a  close  reading of status updates is needed, the three  sources types identified in the previous sec- tion  may  not  be  of  great  help,  simply  because they have not been able to preserve   the rapid update of huge amounts of data –  for  instance,  Web  crawling  only  preserves  the  immediately  visible  content  on  a  web- page, whereas what will appear when scroll- ing down is not archived. Therefore, a fourth  main source type will prove to be very valu- able,  namely  the  content  archived  via  an  Application  Programming  Interface   API ,  that  is,  a  programing  interface  through  which  data  can  be  requested  directly  from  the  provider’s  server. What  is  collected  via  an API is not a webpage as such, but rather  some of the elements from which a webpage  can  be  composed,  such  as  posts,  images,  likes, and comments on Facebook, or tweets,  re-tweets,  and  Favorites  from  Twitter,  as  well as information that was not necessarily  visible to the users, for instance, information  about  geolocation  when  mobile  media  are  used. Usually, the collected elements have to  be  organized  in  a  database  before  they  are  ready for scholarly use.9  Material collected via an API also comes  with  a  number  of  challenges   cf.  Laursen  et  al.,  2013 .  The  first  challenge  is  to  find  the  material  from  the  past.  National  Web  archives  usually  do  not  use APIs  when  col- lecting the Web, so although this may change  in the future it is not very likely that one can  find  API-based  collections  in  existing  Web  archives. Archiving with APIs is widespread   as  micro  archiving,  performed  by  research  projects or by individual researchers. However,  it can be very difficult to find and be granted  access  to  this  type  of  material,  and  often  it  will be customized to fit the research project in   question, which obviously is a challenge for   a historical study with another research agenda.  A  final  possibility  for  gathering  material  from the past via APIs is to fetch the material  anew from the social media provider. This is  possible as long as the material is still avail- able, either by doing this oneself or by using  a  retail  data  outlet  with  extended  access  to,  for instance, Twitter data. In either case, the  social media company functions as a ‘living  Web  archive’.  But  this  solution  also  has  its  drawbacks. Using a data outlet can be costly,    web history and soCial Media  203  and no matter if one does the collecting one- self or a data outlet is used, it is not always  clear  to  what  extent  a  fully  comprehensive  dataset has been gathered because one has to  rely on the provider  the social media com- pany  or  the  data  vendor   actually  providing  what  one  thinks  is  provided.  Social  media  companies  often  only  provide  random  sam- ples of the total data, they can have censored  out  or  simply  not  included  specific  types  of  data,  or  they  can  have  made  changes  to  the  API,  which  happens  on  a  regular  basis   Kumar et al., 2015, pp. 40–41; Lomborg &  Bechmann, 2014, p. 260 . In addition, since  the material is not preserved elsewhere, there  is no possibility of checking to what extent it  is comprehensive  Bruns et al., 2013, p. 876;  Lomborg & Bechmann, 2014, pp. 256–257 .  The impact of these two drawbacks grows as  time goes by, because the social media plat- form in question may have made changes in  their technical setup, content types may have  disappeared and thereby no longer be avail- able via the API, or content once online may  have  been  removed   such  as  personal  pro- files   and  may  thus  no  longer  be  available  either. The scholar who has found  or bought   Web material from the past, archived via API,  may  either  find  the  material  presented  in  a  structured  form  in  a  database   for  instance,  done by a company , or it may be raw data.  In the first case, the challenge is that one has  to  make  do  with  the  analytical  possibilities  enabled by the structured format of the mate- rial. In the latter case, it can be a challenge to  manage the large quantities of data, just as a  certain degree of computer skills is needed.  API  archived  Web  material  also  enables  some  types  of  studies  while  disabling  oth- ers.  It  is  very  usable  for  ‘big  data’  studies  of  trends,  structures,  and  the  like,  as  well  as  studies  of  information  otherwise  hidden,  such  as  geolocation,  but  it  is  less  usable  in  cases where the focus is on how the elements  retrieved by the API, such as images, status  updates,  tweets,  etc.,  were  displayed  when  they were originally online, for instance with  a view to associating image and text elements   present  on  a  webpage  at  the  same  time    cf. Brügger, 2015; Weller, 2015 .  Inaccessibility  It is a characteristic of social media that large  portions of the material are not freely acces- sible, and such fenced-off Web material can  be a challenge to historical studies based on  the archived Web. Sources may not be acces- sible for two reasons.  First,  the  material  was  originally  private  and  hence  only  accessible  to  the  users  con- tributing the content or their social networks,  is in the case of Facebook profiles and net- works of friends, or private profiles and direct  messages  on  Twitter.  This  type  of  material  can  usually  not  be  found  in  Web  archives  based on macro archiving, but it is more com- mon to find such material as part of research  projects, with the consequence that it is dif- ficult  to  grant  access  to  other  people  than  the  researchers  who  originally  collected  the  material  for  their  specific  research  purpose.  However, some of the material from personal  profiles may have ended up in national Web  archives, because authors were not aware of  the  reach  of  their  expressions,  as  seen  with  the  syndication  of  content  on  personal  pro- files on Facebook which is automatically dis- seminated to other Facebook pages – or even  beyond  Facebook  –  through  an  opaque  net- work of ‘friends’ and newsfeeds.  Second,  the  material  was  initially  acces- sible, but later may not be freely accessible,  either  because  the  social  media  company  denies  access,  or  because  the  material  is  difficult  to  make  accessible.  This  denial  of  access  can  come  in  different  forms.  For  instance,  between  approximately  2009  and  2015 Facebook pages could not be found in  the  Internet  Archive.  The  Internet  Archive  does  respect  website  holders’  wishes  not  to  be included in the archive  a preference usu- ally expressed in the robots.txt file , and this  also  applies  retrospectively,  which  is  why  Facebook pages could no longer be found in    204  the Internet Archive in the period mentioned  above   cf.  Brügger,  2015,  p.  2 .  However,  archived versions of public Facebook pages  can often be found in national Web archives  if  the  archive  does  not  respect  robots.txt   as is the case with the Danish Web archive  Netarkivet .  Another  means  of  denying  access  is  to  block  or  prohibit  the  use  of  a  social  media  company’s  API  for  archiv- ing  purposes.  Social  media  companies  may  decide  to  close  a  researcher’s  access  to  the  API  for  whatever  reason.  In  addition,  for  instance,  Twitter  does  not  give  access  via  their API to complete historical data, which  is why this has to be purchased from a data  outlet   cf.  Kumar  et  al.,  2015,  p.  41 .  The  Twitter collection at the Library of Congress  is  illustrative  of  the  challenges  of  archiving  social  media  data  and  making  it  accessi- ble. Five years after Twitter and the Library   of  Congress  announced  that  every  public  tweet  would  be  made  available  to  research- ers, practical as well as policy challenges still  prevent  researcher  access  to  this  valuable  archive   cf.  Zimmer,  2015;  see  also  Bruns  and Weller, 2016 .  Integrated Digital Media  Environments  As mentioned above, social media often con- stitute very integrated digital media environ- ments,  where  content  is  disseminated  in  a  constant  flow  across  websites  via  syndica- tion,  feeds,  sharing,  embeddedness  and  rec- ommendations – Facebook feeds and tweets  are syndicated or shared, and YouTube videos  and images are embedded and recommended  across  the  Web.  This  close  networked  inte- gration adds an additional layer of complex- ity for anyone studying social media  Ellison  & boyd, 2013, p. 165 , but this is particularly  challenging  for  the  scholar  who  wants  to  study the history of social media, insofar as a  study  of  one  type  of  social  media  demands  access  to  the  social  media  to  which  it  is  related.  But  longer  be   these  may  no   accessible,  either  they  are  not  preserved  at  all,  or  they  may  even  be  preserved,  but  are  difficult  to  find  and  relate  to  the  specific  social media being examined. In short, with  social  media  one  has  to  study  an  integrated  media  environment  of  which  the  reach  is  opaque, and which it is probably impossible  to find preserved anywhere in its integrity.  looking back – examples of  social media Web hisTories  Let  us  now  turn  to  how  all  the  above  affect  the  historiography  of  the  Web  history  of  social media. As of today, the number of his- torical studies of social media on the Web is  very limited, and with good reason since the  phenomenon  is  quite  new.  However,  a  few  social media studies with a historical approach  have been made, but some of these were not  using  the  Web  of  the  past  as  a  source,  and  only very few were based on archived Web.  As  for  the  studies  not  using  the  Web  as  a  source,  some  were  building  on  surveys  and  in-depth interviews  Archambault & Grudin,  2012;  Steinfield  et  al.,  2008 ,  others  were  probably studying the material as it was still  online,  although  this  is  not  clearly  stated   boyd & Ellison, 2008 , and in a few cases it  is not clear exactly what the empirical basis is   e.g.,  the  historical  overview  in  van  Dijck   2013,  pp.  3–23 ,  or  the  study  of  Twitter’s  interface’s mode of addressing and its changes  in van Dijck  2011, pp. 336–338  . Regarding  the  studies  actually  based  on  archived Web,  two are based on data collected by the schol- ars themselves, while the event they studied  unfolded  Williams & Gulati, 2012 , and this  dataset  was  later  used  together  with  newly  collected  data   Gulati  &  Williams,  2013 ,  hence,  these  studies  were  not  using  found  archived Web. This is the case in only three  studies, either based on previously collected  datasets  of  Facebook   Page  et  al.,  2013;  Stutzman  et  al.,  2012   or  based  on  screen  shots found on the Web  Brügger, 2015 .   web history and soCial Media  205  Thus,  the  existing  literature  only  pro- vides  few  answers  to  how  the  use  of  the  archived  Web  affects  the  historiography  of  the Web  history  of  social  media. Therefore,  another  approach  has  to  be  adopted  in  the  following, namely to put oneself in a future  Web  historian’s  place.  How  can  scholars  in   20  years’  time  write  the  history  of  social  media on the Web if they have not preserved  old Web material themselves? With a view not  to  imagining  future  studies  out  of  nowhere,  the point of departure will be already existing  studies,  and  the  question  is  how  they  could  be re-made as historical studies in 20 years.   The  focus  is  on  three  main  types  of  social  media  –  Facebook,  Twitter,  and YouTube  –   which  have  been  with  us  on  the  Web  for  quite some time, and which each place spe- cial demands on the use of archived Web as  a  source. A  vast  number  of  academic  work  about social media has been published over  the last decade, and the following choice of  illustrative examples does not claim any form  of representativity vis-à-vis this body of liter- ature.10 In the following, the focus is primar- ily on the challenges related to the acquiring  of the source material to be studied. Thus, rel- evant and important issues, such as research  ethics and privacy, are not discussed.11  Facebook  A very large portion of the academic studies  of Facebook focus on social interaction, use,  social  networking,  behaviour,  motives,  and  the like, and they are based on the inclusion  of people being studied  respondents, people  answering surveys, etc. , which is why they  usually  use  methodological  approaches  that  do  not  involve  the  Web,  such  as  surveys,  questionnaires,  panels,  interviews,  focus  groups, or experiments labs. There also exist  a  considerable  body  of  academic  literature  where  the  Web  is  actually  analysed  as  a  source in its own right, in the main in studies  focusing  on  the  semiotic  content  of  web- pages,  using  methods  such  as  content   analysis, rhetorical analysis, discourse analy- sis, or hyperlink studies.  Scholars  who  intend  to  write  histories  of Facebook on the Web in the future, with  a  focus  on  the  semiotic,  must  take  the  fol- lowing three points into consideration when  looking for sources.  The  first  thing  to  consider  is  whether  the  object  of  study  was  a  public  or  private  Facebook page. If the study is about a pub- licly  available  Facebook  page,  such  as  the  page  ‘Persian  Gulf’   KhosraviNik  &  Zia,  2014 , it may be possible to find sources to  support  a  historical  study  in  Web  archives   or  even  on  the  Web,  such  as  screen  dumps  or pdfs. But if the study includes material on  closed Facebook pages, such as profile pho- tographs  Hum et al., 2011 , or even a closed  page  belonging  to  a  deceased  person,  a  so- called memorialized page  Church, 2013 , it  can be almost impossible to make a historical  study of exactly the same webpages because  it  is  very  unlikely  that  they  have  been  pre- served  in  any  form.  National  Web  archives  usually do not preserve material which is not  public, and finding screen shots or the like of  closed profiles on the online Web is not very  likely to happen.  Second, the number of webpages to include  plays a role. If only one Facebook page is at  the heart of the study  as in KhosraviNik &  Zia, 2014 , it is probably easier to find older  versions  of  this  webpage  than  if  a  much  larger  number  is  needed   as  in  Hum  et  al.,  2011  150 Facebook profiles  .  Third, the chance of finding relevant his- torical  sources  from  Facebook  is  dependent  on which parts of Facebook on the Web the  historical study focuses on. For some studies  it is important to have the entire layout  Hunt,  2015  or the entire page  Gulati & Williams,  2013  or the profile  Grasmuck et al., 2009 ,  whereas  others  only  need  the  wall  posts   Church, 2013; Hunt, 2015  or a status update  and  the  derived  comments   Frobenius  &  Harper, 2015 , and yet others study other ele- ments on the Facebook pages, such as profile  photographs  Hum et al., 2011  or hyperlinks    206   Poell, 2014 . In all these cases, the challenge  is that the more specific the focus, the more  difficult it is to find preserved material. Web  archives based on Web crawling may not have  preserved all elements, which is obviously a  problem for someone wanting to study these  elements, be that profile photographs or the  continuous content flow on Facebook walls.  An  API-based  dataset  would  be  preferable  for this kind of study, at the expense of los- ing  the  context  in  which  the  elements  were  displayed.  Twitter  Twitter  has  a  very  different  communicative  mode  compared  to  Facebook.  The  form  of  expression has been limited to 140 characters  for most of its history, tweets are in the main  broadcast  publicly,  they  can  be  re-tweeted   reposting  another  profile’s  tweet ,  and  the  relation between profile owners is based on  followers, that is, social relations with asym- metric ties.  The  biggest  challenge  for  a  scholar  who  intends to make a historical study of Twitter  where  the  actual  content  is  the  main  source  is to find the material or, to be more precise,  to  find  the  correct  material.  For  instance,  if  a  scholar  in  20  years’  time  wants  to  study  the patterns of Twitter usage during political  events   as  in  Bruns  et  al.,  2013,  or  Johnson  et al., 2013  the major problem is to find the  right material to study. As mentioned above,  Twitter’s  API  makes  it  possible  to  retrieve  data back in time, but at the expense that the  researcher never knows exactly to what extent  the collection is comprehensive  e.g., regard- ing the hashtags in question , and this prob- lem  increases  the  further  back  in  time  one  goes  cf. Bruns et al., 2013, p. 876 .  Another  solution  would  be  to  go  to  a  national  Web  archive.  However,  the  chal- lenge in this respect is that Twitter material  has  rarely  been  archived  via  API  by  these  archives;  rather,  it  is  preserved  through   Web crawling. This implies that one cannot  expect to find a comprehensive dataset of, for  instance, all tweets, since Web archives usu- ally only archive a selection of profiles  poli- ticians,  celebrities,  or  the  like   or  hashtags  related to specific events, and not the entire  communicative  ecology  with  followers  and  re-tweets,  which  would  enable  ‘big  data’  analyses of large amounts of data. However,  having  the  profile  pages  may  constitute  an  advantage if the study is about the historical  development  of  profile  pages   and  not  only  the flow of tweets .  The  last  solution  regarding  finding  old  Twitter material would be to look for screen  shots on the Web, but putting tweets on the  Web is not as widespread as is the case with  screen  shots  of  Facebook,  and  screen  shots  will not allow for studies of larger trends and  patterns.  If  the  scholar  has  succeeded  in  finding  material,  the  three  points  mentioned  above  regarding  Facebook  also  apply:  finding  old  Twitter  material  from  private  profiles  or  direct  messages  is  probably  not  easy;  the  more material is needed, the more difficult it  is  to  provide  this  and  the  bigger  the  uncer- tainty  as  to  the  comprehensiveness;  and  the  more  specific  the  study   specific  hashtags,  only re-tweets, or the like , the more difficult  it probably is to find relevant material.  YouTube  A scholar who intends to conduct a Web his- torical  study  of  social  media  involving  YouTube  will  in  particular  have  to  address  three challenges.  First,  if  the  historical  study  is  about  spe- cific videos, for instance a study of the nar- ratives used by extremist religious groups in  YouTube videos  Vergani & Zuev, 2015 , or  in direct-to-consumer genetic testing  Harris  et  al.,  2014 ,  the  major  problem  is  to  find  archived versions of the videos, in the main  because videos are usually not preserved by    web history and soCial Media  207  national Web archives, which base their col- lection on Web crawling. YouTube videos can  be preserved, but it has to be done manually,  which is why almost no Web archives do this,  at least not in a systematic way. Videos may  still be found on the online Web – either on  YouTube or elsewhere – but as time goes by  this will be more the exception than the rule. Second,  the  historical  study  may  want  to  include  the  context  that  originally  sur- rounded the video when it was initially pub- lished on YouTube. This could, for instance,  be a study of activist communication  Poell,  2014 ,  which  includes  a  hyperlink  analy- sis  of  the  outgoing  links  from  YouTube’s  video webpages; or it could be a study with  a  focus  on  the  commentaries  on  a  webpage  where a YouTube video was published, such  as  audience  reactions  to  TED  Talks,  based  on  a  content  analysis  of  comments   Tsou  et  al.,  2014 ,  or  the  study  of  the  comments  to a singer’s music video posted on YouTube   Davison, 2013 . National Web archives may  have archived these webpages, but in particu- lar  the  commentaries  are  difficult  to  collect  for a Web crawler  for technical reasons often  only  one  page  of  comments  is  preserved .  Thus,  this  type  of  study  is  only  possible  if  someone has preserved the commentaries as  screen shots or as a screen movie and made  this accessible.  Third, if the historical study is not focused  on  the  videos  in  their  original  context  on  YouTube,  but  rather  on  the  videos  as  they  were embedded in other types of Web envi- ronments  personal websites, news and media  websites, other social media , for instance in  a study of the use of YouTube in activist com- munication   as  is  the  case  in  Poell,  2014 ,  it  can  be  very  difficult  to  establish  the  link  between  the  embedded  hyperlink  and  the  actual  video,  because  the  original YouTube  video  may  no  longer  be  at  the  same  URL.  And even if the original URL is known, it is  difficult to find the video based on this infor- mation,  be  that  in  a  Web  archive  or  on  the  online Web.  More Social Media, More   Complex Sources  Each  of  the  examples  above  focus  on  one  social  media  platform.  However,  future  his- torians  may  very  well  want  to  study  more  social media at the same time, either in their  closely  integrated  form,  or  just  more  social  media in relation to a given topic.  The  first  is  the  case  when  closely  inte- grated social media are studied, for instance  a  study  of  Facebook  where  focus  is  on  the  use  of  video,  and  these  videos  are  embed- ded from YouTube. In such a project, one has  to  find  not  only  the  relevant  Facebook  and  YouTube  material,  but  the  software-based  connections  between  the  two  datasets  also  have  to  be  established,  which  raises  ques- tions  of  space  as  well  as  of  time:  have  we  found  the  videos  that  were  actually  there  on YouTube  in  the  past? And  is  there  tem- poral  consistency  between  the  video  on  YouTube and the embedded command on the  Facebook page?  And the latter could be a study of an event  where  more  social  media  are  part  of  the  analysis without having a focus on their tech- nical  integration,  such  as  the  study  of  how  social  media  were  used  in  activist  protests  at the 2010 Toronto G-20 summit, where the  focus  was  on  Twitter, YouTube,  Flickr  and  Facebook  Poell, 2014 .  In  both  cases,  it  is  necessary  to  provide  sources  from  different  social  media,  and  thereby  probably  different  source  types.  Obviously, this increases the complexity, and  the challenge is how these sources could be  combined.  The Challenges When   Looking Back  The  available  source  material  has  a  strong  impact  on  which  histories  can  be  written,  and,  as  demonstrated  above,  a  number  of  histories of social media on the Web will be    208  very hard to write, simply because no sources  are available or the available sources are not  usable.  A future Web historian who wants to write  a Web history of social media based on the  archived Web is facing the following mecha- nisms when looking for relevant and usable  sources.  The  more  fenced-off  the  material  was originally, the more difficult it is to find  archived versions of it. The more objects are  to be included in the study, the more difficult  it  is  to  find  all  the  necessary  sources. And,  finally,  the  more  specific  the  study   specfic  pages profiles,  videos,  and or  periods  in  time , the more difficult it is to find relevant  and usable sources. And the other way round:  the more general the topic, the easier it is to  find relevant sources. And when these three  mechanisms  are  combined  it  becomes  clear  that,  for  instance,  a  historical  study  of  500  private  Facebook  profiles  at  three  specific  points  in  time  in  the  past  and  their  use  of  status updates may have a hard time finding  something to study at all, whereas a histori- cal study of general trends on 10 politicians’  public  Facebook  pages  may  be  an  easier  task. Therefore, the more difficult it is to find  archived  versions  of  social  media,  the  big- ger the need to base one’s study on second- ary source types, for instance studies of one’s  topic which were made in the past, at the time  one wants to study  for an example, see van  Dijck, 2011, pp. 338–341 .  The fuTure  Although the history of social media on the  Web  is  relatively  short,  a  lot  of  decisive  developments have already taken place, some  of which point towards new challenges loom- ing  in  the  horizon  of  social  media  historio- graphy.  Concerning  social  media  and  the  Web,  three  general  waves  of  development  can be identified.  The  first  wave  of  social  media  started  on  and  developed  with  the  Web,  be  that   Facebook,  LinkedIn,  Twitter, YouTube,  and  others.  In  the  second  wave,  the  existing  Web- based  social  media  began  to  expand  to  include  mobile  media,  which  takes  place  in  three steps: first, with the mobile phone with  a physical keyboard and no camera; second,  with the camera-equipped mobile phone; and  third, with the smart phone with touch screen,  geolocation, still and video camera, and apps.  In  this  second  wave,  social  media  not  only  supplement their already existing Web pres- ence with a presence on mobile media in the  form  of  apps,  but  this  expansion  also  feeds  back to the Web versions, because the mobile  media enables new forms of expression and  interaction  that  were  not  possible  with  lap- tops or desktop computers. For instance, the  spread of amateur videos on YouTube is made  possible  by  the  smart  phone   mobile  video  camera, high-speed internet access, apps  and  the easy embedding in other social media.  The  third  wave  is  characterized  by  the  emergence  of  a  new  generation  of  social  media which has almost no attachment to the  Web, but is exclusively based on the smart- phone, and has a strong emphasis on images  and video, in particular Instagram, Snapchat,  and  Tinder,  whereas  the  Web  still  plays  a  role  in  Pinterest.  Just  as  the  ‘old’  social  media were born with and on the Web, this  third wave of social media is born with and  on  the  mobile  platforms.  However,  they  are  also  entangled  with  the Web  in  the  form  of  embedded content and functionality, be that  on other social media or on any other web- site that has included a content feed such as a  feed of status updates from Facebook.  It is important to stress that the three waves  have  not  existed  as  separated  waves.  They  overlap,  and  when  the  next  wave  hits  land,  the  already  existing  social  media  types  do  not disappear; on the contrary, they co-exist  with the new wave, but in a re-configured and  reshaped  form,  prompted  by  the  new  wave.  Although  social  media  on  mobile  platforms  have expanded, social media on the Web have  not  disappeared;  rather,  they  have  changed    web history and soCial Media  209  and have become embedded in a new social  media ecology. However, the role of the Web  will  probably  continue  to  change,  with  the  usage patterns of the coming generations. For  instance, in 2015, 91% of teens in the USA  went online from a mobile device  Lenhart,  2015,  p.  14 ,  and  the  adoption  of  smart- phones  and  tablet  computers  has  grown  in  the period 2011–2015, whereas desktop and  laptop computers has stayed flat  Anderson,  2015, p. 3 .  Nevertheless,  despite  the  rapid  pace  of  change  in  social  media   Ellison  &  boyd,  2013,  pp.  165–166 ,  the  history  of  social  media on the Web will probably be a relevant  topic  of  study  for  many  years. As  a  conse- quence,  the  need  for  archived  Web  materi- als will still be predominant. And so will all  the  challenges  outlined  above.  But  the  last  two waves of social media underline that it  is imperative that the academic communities  and the archiving institutions start to debate  how these new mediated forms of social inter- action  should  be  collected  and  preserved,  thus enabling future historians to study our  age. Preserving the ‘look-and-feel’ of social  media  apps  is  still  an  unresolved  problem,  as is the preservation of social media, with  a proclaimed aim of not being preserved, in  particular Snapchat. Snapchat and apps can  be  collected  by  making  either  screen  shots  or screen videos, eventually combined with  content retrieved via API, which may be use- ful for a research project, but which does not  scale-up if the aim is to collect and preserve  a national or trans-national cultural heritage.  Thus, a study of today’s Instagram  Seltzer  et al., 2015  or Snapchat  Bayer et al., 2016   will  be  very  difficult  to  transform  into  his- torical studies, if the problems of preserving  these social media are not resolved.  In  terms  of  finding  historical  sources  of  social  media,  future  historians  are  fac- ing  a  double  challenge.  Social  media  have  developed and so has the preservation of the  social  media.  But  these  two  developments  are  almost  always  out  of  sync:  the  social  media  have  a  dynamic  of  their  own,  and  so   has  the  archiving  practices,  be  that  macro  as  well  as  micro  archiving. This  means  that  the challenges above are very likely to have  been  supplemented  by  other  challenges  in   20  years’  time.  Not  replaced,  but  supple- mented, because the challenges of today do not  disappear  –  today’s  archived  material  is  still  there – and the Web historian of the future will  therefore  experience  an  accumulation  of  old  and  new  challenges  which  persist  over  time,  and which constantly have to be negotiated.  As with any other type of historical study,  the writing of social media histories is faced  with  the  challenge  of  making  do  with  what  has been handed down from the past, either  offline  sources  or  archived Web  material  in  cultural  heritage  institutions,  in  researcher- generated  collections,  within  social  media  companies, or material that has survived on  the online Web. There will, of course, be lacu- nae in the source material and some research  questions may not be answered – or maybe  not  even  asked  –  because  of  these  gaps.  Although this state of affairs has been a fun- damental  condition  of  historians’  everyday  lives  for  centuries,  it  will  probably  conflict  with the expectations of future social media  historians, who may find it difficult to under- stand  that  mediated  social  activities,  which  were  somewhat  archived  while  they  took  place, are no longer there. Thus, future histo- rians have to come to terms with the fact that  although Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to  a  large  extent  come  with  their  own  archive  while used today, this may by no means be  the case 20 years later, and even finding rel- evant archived material may be difficult. But  if expectations to the source material are kept  at a realistic level, writing histories of social  media on the Web is definitely a possibility –   and  a  necessity  for  the  understanding  of  social life from the 1990s onwards.  Notes   1   This  chapter  discusses  methodological  issues  related to doing social media Web history based  on  preserved  Web,  but  most  of  the  points  also    210  apply  to  studies  of  contemporary  social  media,  since such studies must to some extent be based  on  preserved  material  which  can  be  analysed  and used to document the study. This is particu- larly important since contemporary social media  change  at  a  very  rapid  pace,  as  pointed  out  in  Ellison and boyd  2013, pp. 165–167 , although  they do not identify the need to preserve previous  versions, before changes were made.     2   For  a  detailed  comparison  of  archived  Web  to   digitized collections, see Brügger  2011a, 2017 .     3   A couple of figures to illustrate this: the average  life span of a web page is often said to be two  months   Brügger,  2012,  p.  318 ;  almost  50%  of  .uk  websites  have  disappeared  again  within  a year  Jackson, 2015 ; out of 10 million mainly  Japanese  websites  collected  in  2001,  90%  had  disappeared in 2013  Agata et al., 2014 .     4   For a brief history of web archiving and an over- view  of  web  archiving  strategies,  see  Brügger   2011b, pp. 29–32 .     5   Each of these points is explained in greater detail   in Brügger  2011b, pp. 32–38 .     6   This section refers some of the insights in Laursen   et al.  2013 .     7   The  crawled  Web  in  Web  archives  has  a  num- ber  of  other  characteristics  which  are  relevant  to  consider  when  using  archived  Web  material,  in  particular  big  Web  archives  based  on  macro  archiving. These are elaborated in detail in Brüg- ger  2011a, 2011b, 2016 .     8   For  an  overview  of  existing  web  archives,  see  Member Archives  n.d. , and List of Web archiving  initiatives   n.d. .  Cf.  also  Webster   2017   for  a  first attempt to write the history of web archiving   initiatives.     9   Discussions  about  the  use  of  APIs  for  aca- demic  purposes  can  be  found  in  Lomborg  and  Bechmann   2014 ,  and  for  Twitter  in  particular,  see Kumar et al.  2015 .   10   The examples have been chosen based on the cri- teria that they should represent a typical study of  social media on the Web where the Web as such  is to some extent included.   11   Some  of  the  ethical  issues  related  to  using  archived web for research purposes are discussed  in  Lomborg   2012   where  a  useful  list  of  refer- ences can also be found.  references  Abbate,  J.   2000 .

So  ‘Free  Basics,’  as  Facebook had re-dubbed its ostensibly phil- anthropic  effort  ‘Internet.org,’  died  quickly  in  a  power  struggle  among  a  powerful  American  social  media  company,  resentful  Indian technology developers, overwhelmed  regulators, sensitive nationalistic politicians,  highly organized public interest activists, and  rival  mobile  service  providers.  It  was  a  remarkable tale of ideological hubris on the  part  of  Facebook  founder  and  CEO  Mark  Zuckerberg and the ambitions of Indian citi- zens and companies, who grew to resent the  efforts  and  claims  that  Facebook  made  on  behalf of poorer Indians  Bhatia, 2016 . This  story demonstrates the vast complexity of the   political  economy  of  social  media.  Issues  such as neocolonialism, cultural imperialism,  competition policy, political corruption, digi- tal activism, class struggle, and the ideologi- cal  foundations  of  Silicon  Valley  work  to  affect how social media function in our lives  across the globe.  We  think  we  understand  social  media.  After all, we seem to increasingly live in and  through  them.  The  record  of  social  media  and their effects on global society and poli- tics  seems  well  documented.  Since  the  rise  of Facebook midway through the first decade  of the 21st century, tyrants and tycoons alike  have  waxed  anxiously  about  its  influence  over its more than 1.5 billion users. Twitter,  although used by far fewer, has been credited  with  outsized  influence  on  politics  and  cul- ture. The fall of Myspace, with its youthful  exuberance  and  inflated  market  capitaliza- tion,  serves  as  a  cautionary  tale  about  poor  investments  and  fleeting  communities,  and  stands  as  the  greatest  financial  blunder  in  Rupert Murdoch’s long career.   214  But what are we to make of these techno- logical tools and their influence on our lives?  How  shall  we  assess  the  role  of  regulation  and  the  need  for  more?  How  empowered  are these 1.6 billion users? How powerful is  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg relative  to Rupert Murdoch, among others? And have  scholars fully grasped the trajectory of ideo- logically  driven  technological  change  that  almost instantly captured the attention of bil- lions across the globe?  The  study  of  the  political  economy  of  social  media  in  the  first  two  decades  of  the  21st  century  has  been  far  less  dynamic  than its subject of study. Scholarship is still  framed  along  the  lines  outlined  by  three  major schools of media analysis of the 20th  century:  Frankfurt-School-inspired  criti- cal theory  Adorno, 2001; Habermas, 1984;  McCarthy,  1978 ;  Marxian-inspired  Critical  Political  Economy   Golding  and  Murdock,  1997;  Mosco,  2010 ;  and  Cultural  Studies,  the strongest critical response to the two clas- sic  political  economy  schools   Grossberg,  2010; Hall, 1997 . The most prolific scholar  of  the  political  economy  of  social  media,  Christian Fuchs  2009, 2012a, 2014a, 2015 ,  has  staked  out  the  claim  that  the  Marxian- inspired theories of the Frankfurt School and  Critical  Political  Economy  suffice  for  full  understanding. And he has done great service  in  outlining  how  we  can  revive  and  revise  concepts such as exploitation, surplus value,  and  commodity  fetishism  while  examining  how  people  and  groups  deploy  and  endure  social media platforms. But by merely revis- ing and extending the arguments of the late  20th century, the study of the political econ- omy of social media has failed to capture the  full range of consequences and rapid changes  in  the  field.  More  importantly,  scholarship  has failed to influence how regulators and the  public view and influence social media plat- forms and the firms that promote it.  The  study  of  political  economy  of  social  media  has  largely  been  framed  within  and  among  various  interpretations  of  Marx- influenced thought, whether echoing Gramsci    Gramsci,  Hoare  and  Nowell-Smith,  1971 ,  Adorno  2001 , Habermas  1984 , or Smythe   1977 .  But  has  this  been  adequate  and  appropriate?  Have  we  used  the  best  lenses  to  examine  a  phenomenon  as  influential  and fast-growing as social media in the 21st  century?  Social  media  platforms  such  as  Facebook,  Twitter,  Instagram,  and  even  the  failed Myspace, demonstrate a more complex  and  perhaps  sui  generis  relationship  among  firm,  ‘user’   as  opposed  to  audience ,  labor   which can include the ‘user’ , and states than  film and radio did in the time of the Frankfurt  School or television and early computers did  during the rise of Critical Political Economy.  The  categories  and  assumptions  of  classic  political economy are largely based on static  categories. The major debates within the field  have too often turned inward on theory, mak- ing them more about the terms of debate than  the consequences of the subject and its exer- cise of power in the world.  I  will  offer  one  significant  recent  debate  that  has  occupied  political  economy  schol- ars  in  recent  years.  In  1977  Smythe  shook  up  the  study  of  both  political  economy  and  media  by  publishing  an  article  that  chal- lenged Marxist theorists to take communica- tion  seriously,  as  more  than  just  the  source  of  ideology  formation.  Smythe  posited  that  the  relationship  of  audience  to  advertising- driven  media  industries  could  be  captured  through a hybrid identity he called ‘audience  commodity.’ Smyth explained that the audi- ence commodity is what television networks   and  radio  stations  and  newspapers   sell  to  advertising firms. But that’s not all. The role  that audience members play in this transac- tion goes beyond that of a passive commodity  like cattle or wheat. The audience performs a  form of labor, Smythe argued, that enhances  the value of the media firms.  Smythe started an intense debate about this  concept  among  media  scholars  in  the  1980s  and influenced the rise and tone of the Cultural  Studies  response  to  political  economy.  As  Rigi  and  Prey   2015   explain,  the  debate  cooled  until  Fuchs   2010   revived  it  with  a    the inCoMPlete PolitiCal eConoMy oF soCial Media   215  strong  case  that  social  media  users  provide  value  and  surplus  value  to  firms  because  –   beyond  the  ill-defined  labor  that  Smythe  asserted audiences performed – social media  users  clearly  produce  actual  works  of  crea- tive expression that social media firms frame  and distribute. So in addition to serving as the  sources  of  attention  that  social  media  firms  sell to advertisers  so-called ‘eyeballs’ , users  are  also  the  chief  labor  force  in  the  compo- sition of the content that makes social media  worthwhile,  influential,  and  profitable.  This  is  valuable  insight  that  not  only  extends  Smythe’s  argument  but  helps  us  grasp  how  the social media user is in fact different than  the television or film audience member.  The immediate critical response to Fuchs  was  based  not  so  much  on  whether  Fuchs  failed  to  describe  the  role  of  the  user,  but  about  whether  Fuchs  deployed  Marx’s   1992   labor  theory  of  value  appropriately.  Arvidsson  and  Colleoni   2012   replied  that  the value of social media user activity is more  centered in the social connections and affec- tive expressions users produce than on labor  per se. Fuchs  2012b  responded to their crit- icisms. Then Rigi and Prey  2015  recounted  the debate and produced data that served to  complicate and undermine Fuchs’ argument.  This entire debate was interesting, but more  for  the  ways  these  scholars  read  Marx  than  for  what  they  wrote  about  social  media.  In  each of these accounts, social media services  are  static,  stable,  powerful,  and  valuable.  They never rise, fall, fail, or corrupt. There is  no action, only interpretation.  Perhaps  by  adding  a  perspective  to  these  analytical  lenses  we  can  bring  more  clearly  into view the role social media companies play  in our lives and the ways that they affect – and  are affected by – matrices of power and regu- lation across the globe. But to do this, we must  examine the particulars of how social media  companies  and  platforms  have  worked  and  failed in the world. And we should be open to  going beyond defending or extrapolating one  particular theory or another. As I have argued  elsewhere   Vaidhyanathan,  2006 ,  Political   Economy approaches can benefit greatly from  adopting  an  appreciation  of  the  meaning- making dynamics of users and audiences that  Cultural Studies scholars have brought forth.  And Cultural Studies scholars no longer have  the  luxury  of  suspending  consideration  of  architecture, economic power, and regulation  when  considering  how  users  and  audiences  perform  their  roles  and  organize  themselves  into discursive communities. Maintaining the  boundaries between these schools of thought  inhibits the fullest understanding of media and  power.  Schools  and  theories  should  supple- ment, not displace, each other. If media theo- rists don’t look up to see what’s coming next,  we  risk  irrelevance  and  could  fail  to  guide  publics, markets, and states as we should.  WhaT do social media do?  Social media may, as McLuhan  1964  pre- dicted, contain streams of all previous media  forms. They also foster new capabilities and  concerns.  They  scramble  the  contexts  in  which we have grown comfortable, so mixing  the  personal,  the  political,  the  commercial,  and the cultural that we have spent more than  a decade trying to get our bearings and forge  new norms and standards to deal with them   Nissenbaum, 2010 .  those   Beyond   important  observations,  social media are not what we assumed they  were  just  10  years  ago.  Most  scholarship,  understandably  and  including  this  chapter,  take  Facebook  and  Twitter  as  the  core  sub- jects of study. The problem with this practice  is that while both Facebook and Twitter are  popular  and  important  in  2016   when  this  chapter  was  written   they  might  not  be  by  2020.  Twitter,  for  instance,  could  be  broke  and gone by 2018. And they are very differ- ent services with different rules, norms, prac- tices, and demands on users. Unsurprisingly,  they  function  differently  in  users’  lives.  In  addition, both Facebook and Twitter entered  our  lives  first  as  Web-based  platforms,    216  experienced  chiefly  through  desktop  and  laptop  computers  linked  via  relatively  open  networks.  Use  quickly  and  overwhelmingly  shifted  to  proprietary  mobile  applications,  which allow both companies to control much  more of the user experience and successfully  harvest more and more valuable user behav- ior  records.  The  rise  of  ‘mobile-first’  plat- forms such as Instagram and Snapchat further  complicates  the  story  and  study  of  social  media. People use these differently than they  do  Facebook.  Beyond  the  major  services  of  North America  and Western  Europe, Weibo  and  WeChat,  for  instance,  deserves  signifi- cant and different study, simply because they  are important social network services in the  largest  countries  in  the  world. And  examin- ing social media as media also misses some  important  phenomena.  For  instance,  as  fit- ness  applications  connect  with  devices  that  sit on human bodies yet also connect users to  each other, they qualify as ‘social,’ but main- tain a distinct relationship between users and  the firms that manage these exchanges.  So social media platforms are both singu- lar and diverse in their nature, their architec- ture, their goals, the variety of uses to which  they  are  put,  and  their  ability  to  generate  anxiety  among  parents,  pundits,  and  politi- cians   boyd,  2014 . Among  other  important  phenomena, social media platforms also offer  users   an  unsatisfying  term  I  deploy  with  full  awareness  of  its  inadequacy   new  ways  of  defining  and  promoting  themselves,  thus  imposing an ideology of ‘self-branding’ and  capitulation to the demands of an ‘attention  economy’  Marwick, 2013 .  For  these  reasons  I  must  call  for  a  fresh  approach  to  studying  the  political  econ- omy  of  social  media.  Marx  only  takes  us  part  of  the  way  to  clarity. As  Fuchs   2014:  53   explains,  such  theory  is  grounded  in  the  assumption  that  ‘capitalism  a   reduces  humans  to  the  status  of  being  instruments  for capital accumulation in the form of their  role as wage workers and consumers and b   tries to make them believe in the feasibility  of the overall system by using ideology as an    attempted  silencing instrument.’ This argu- ment presumes that all institutions of capital- ism  operate  the  same  ways  everywhere  and  always, and that those of us who live, work,  and  dance  under  capitalism  are  blinded  and  silenced by the enforced parameters of debate  that capital will allow.  But  experience  –  whether  in  the  form  of  Facebook, Google, and Twitter asserting that  they  espouse  values  distinct  from  the  bas- est drives of capital accumulation, or global  youth  protesters  harnessing  social  media  platforms to rouse direct action against capi- talism in 2011 and 2012 – tells us that there  is much more going on. Some firms, if only  temporarily and under ideal conditions, don’t  always follow the rules of capitalism.  We  must  have  more  to  learn  about  this  subject  than  Marxian  theory  allows  us  to  consider.  So  in  this  chapter  I  invite  readers  to  deploy  different  theoretical  lenses,  and  offer as one example a theory largely ignored  for  much  the  past  century:  Institutional  Economics, inspired by the work of an anti- Marxian yet culturally astute economist and  social theorist, Thorstein Veblen. I don’t offer  Veblen  as  a  replacement  for  Marx  and  the  Marxian  tradition.  I  merely  hope  to  inspire  political economists of media to look beyond  the  standard  arguments  and  frameworks.  And  to  inspire  scholars  to  look  beyond  the  Whiggish story of all-powerful and pervasive  social  media  firms  successfully  exploiting  users and corrupting states, I urge readers to  examine the 2015 regulatory conflict between  Facebook and the government of India. But  first we must dissect our subject.  The faceTs and funcTions of  social media: archiTecTure and  infrasTrucTure  At  the  core  of  every  major  social  media  system,  whether  Weibo  or  YouTube,  are  architecture  and  infrastructure.  All  major  social media platforms operate by connecting    the inCoMPlete PolitiCal eConoMy oF soCial Media   217  devices to databases hosted in redundant pro- prietary  server  farms  distributed  across  the  globe. This centralization of search and host- ing  functions,  as  well  as  the  indexing  of  content  according  to  algorithmically- inscribed  company  values,  results  in  a  remarkable  level  of  ideological  control  over  user actions. While people experience only a  light, inviting, shallow interface, the millions  of  lines  of  code,  the  miles  of  fiber-optic  cable,  the  acres  of  air-conditioned  server  farms,  the  tons  of  aluminum,  concrete,  and  glass all remain out of sight and thus out of  mind. Users need not be burdened by knowl- edge of the environmental effects of the infra- structure.  They  should  never  communicate  with a human being who has influence over  the  system.  They  should  see  no  traces  of  human  decision-making  or  labor.  They  also  should  never  concern  themselves  with  the  location  of  the  servers,  despite  the  fact  that  states can heavily surveil and regulate social  media services based on where servers sit. A  server  in  Shanghai  will  generate  different  effects  in  the  world  than  one  sitting  in  Vancouver,  largely  because  of  the  relative  willingness  of  those  governments  to  control  and monitor activities over those servers.  We  have  been  invited  to  describe  this  architectural  choice  –  tapping  into  massive  servers that sit perhaps half a continent away  with instantaneous results on computers that  fit into our palms – as accessing ‘the cloud.’  This  metaphor  has  further  alienated  users  from  the  architecture,  infrastructure,  and  labor that enable social media activity. It has  mystified the system. And it has undermined  efforts to address negative externalities such  as  privacy  violations  and  excessive  control  over  content  distribution   Pariser,  2011;  Vaidhyanathan, 2011, 2015 .  user-generaTed conTenT  The second important facet of social media is  ‘user-generated  content.’  In  2005  Web  and   of   into   individuals   technology  guru  Tim  O’Reilly  declared  the  death of ‘Web 1.0,’ in which static and dis- creet  pages  were  posted  on  small  private  servers distributed around the world, and the  rise  of  ‘Web  2.0.’ This  new  vision  for Web  use  and  production  harvested  the  labor  of  users  who  produced  text,  images,  and  links  that  sat  on  centralized  corporate  servers.  Companies  such  as  Google,  O’Reilly  pre- dicted, would leverage the work of these bil- lions  valuable  ‘user-generated content’ that could be repre- sented,  indexed,  and  used  as  a  template  against which advertisements could be sold.  The key concept to building value, O’Reilly  argued,  was  that  companies  could  exploit  ‘collective intelligence,’ the belief that thou- sands, millions, or billions of discrete actions  and  interactions  could  generate  patterns  of  preference  and  behavior,  allowing  firms  to  mine  that  data  for  optimal  service  to  users   O’Reilly,  2005 .  On  face,  this  manifesto  granted some respect to users and their con- tributions to the fortunes of those who would  build platforms on the World Wide Web  or,  to use O’Reilly’s term, use ‘the Web as plat- form’ . But ultimately, as Scholz  2013  and  others  argue  persuasively,  companies  like  Google,  Facebook,  and  Twitter  depend  almost entirely on the creative labor of their  unpaid  volunteers.  And  as  Fuchs   2014   asserts, this relationship constitutes exploita- tion  in  an  almost  classically  Marxist  fashion.  But through social media, the roles of ‘pro- ducer’ and ‘consumer’ are scrambled. Users  are not so much consumers, or even labor, as  they are commodities or raw material itself.  What Google and Facebook sell is the moni- tored  attention  and  habitual  preferences  of  their users. Their users are thus the product  as well as the producers. That complex rela- tionship distinguishes the political economy  of social media from that of broadcast media,  for instance. A viewer is also the product that  NBC or StarTV sells to advertisers. But that  viewer  does  not  also  provide  valuable  con- tent to a television network or service. Still,    218  paying  close  attention  to  the  rise  of  audi- ence  labor  and  other  forms  of  informal  and  undercompensated labor such as the Amazon  ‘Mechanical Turk’ system  Suri et al., 2016   allows  us  to  move  beyond  the  exclusion  of  ‘audience’  from  traditional,  20th-century  forms  of  political  economy  research  while  also  curbing  the  idealization  of  the  ‘audi- ence’  that  emerged  from  late  20th-century  cultural studies work.  ‘User-generated  content’  models  also  allow firms to evade the risks and strictures  of  classic  publishers.  Traditional  publishers  such as The New York Times or Bertelsmann  make editorial decisions, and thus face poten- tial civil liability if their content violates pri- vacy,  copyright,  or  indecency  laws.  But  in  much  of  the  world,  Web  and  social  media  firms have convinced states to limit liability  because they do not direct users to post par- ticular  content   17  USC  Sec.  512,  47  USC  Sec.  230 .  In  fact,  the  transaction  costs  of  policing   thousands-to-millions  of  posts  are  so high that conforming to such laws would  be  impossible.  The  market  would  not  pro- vide services such as social media or search  engines if these companies were held to the  same  legal  standards  as  traditional  publish- ers. However, in recent years, companies like  Google have seen their officials held to stand- ards  closer  to  that  of  publishers  for  content  their users have posted on social media sites.  And both Google and Facebook have recently  declared that their engineers will take a more  active role in selecting content that users will  see, with the goal of enhancing the news value  of their services  Vaidhyanathan, 2011 .  The  dominant  message  proclaimed  by  Web enthusiasts, from the early days of Web  2.0 through the social and political uprisings  around the Mediterranean Sea in spring 2011,  was that ‘user-generated’ content performed  democratizing, and even liberating, functions   Bruns, 2008; Jenkins, 2006; Shirky, 2008 .  No longer did promulgators of ideas need to  convince  traditional  ‘gate-keeping’  media  firms to publish their work  and assume the  risk to reputation or fortune . Now the risks   to  the  host  company   Facebook,  Twitter,  or  Google   were  lower,  making  it  possible  for  more  transgressive  expression  to  flow.  Communities  could  grow  almost  organi- cally  from  collections  of  links,  comments,  retweets, follows, and ‘likes.’ But such user  interaction also allows companies and states  to monitor and track users, their preferences,  and  their  associations  on  a  much  grander  scale  Gerlitz and Helmond, 2013 .  daTa harvesTing  The  ability  of  social  media  companies  to  harvest and analyze not only specific content  created and posted by users, but the relation- ships  between  these  pieces  of  expression,  allows  for  the  third  essential  facet  of  social  media that political economy must consider:  data harvesting. As early as 2002, leaders of  Google realized that their impressive collec- tion  of  user  data  allowed  them  to  sharpen  their  search  results  and  recommendations,  keeping  users  satisfied  that  Google  under- stood their desires and – perhaps – even read  their  minds   Vaidhyanathan,  2011 .  Once  Google  introduced  its  advertising  programs  soon  after,  the  presence  of  such  large  and  sophisticated  records  on  each  user  and  on  groups  of  users  proved  lucrative.  By  2008  Facebook was struggling to leverage its own  special  and  massive  collection  of  personal  data and expressions of preferences to enable  its  own  advertisement  placement  program.  By  2012  Facebook  had  achieved  the  ability  to use user data both for selecting and prior- itizing  content  on  users’  news  feeds  and  optimizing user-targeted advertising, making  it possible for the company to generate sig- nificant revenue and turn a profit for the third  year in a row  Greenfield, 2012; Thompson,  2009 .  The  practice  of  data  harvesting  and  data  retention  did  not  come  without  costs.  Facebook and Google faced regulatory chal- lenges and investigations in Europe for their    the inCoMPlete PolitiCal eConoMy oF soCial Media   219  data  retention  practices   Levine,  2015 .  And after former US intelligence contractor  Edward Snowden released select documents  about  US  government  data  surveillance  and  mining  programs  in  2013,  it  became  clear  to  citizens,  states,  companies,  and  terrorists  around the world that the practices of social  media  companies  to  harvest,  retain,  and  analyze  data  from  their  users  tempted  curi- ous  state  actors  to  tap  into  those  troves. As  long as Facebook and Google retained valu- able  records  of  users’  behavior  and  expres- sions,  security  services  in  both  democratic  and  authoritarian  governments  would  press  both  companies  to  reveal  records,  resort- ing  to  breaching  the  companies’  security  if  they  failed  to  gain  cooperation   MacAskill  et al., 2013 . These revelations put the repu- tations  of  social  media  companies  at  great  risk, as their utility as sites for collaboration  and communication among dissident groups  came into question.  The  practice  of  data  harvesting  is  largely  hidden  from  users.  There  are  no  obvious  clues  from  applications  and  platforms  like  Instagram or SnapChat that user data is being  recorded, where and for how long it will be  stored, and to what purposes it may be put.  These  and  other  services  do  offer  vague,  technical,  and  unhelpful  ‘privacy  policies’  that  could  answer  some  of  these  questions  for users. But the policies are uninviting and  not  obvious.  One  must  already  be  aware  of  the practice and its risks in order to engage  with  a  privacy  policy  or  adjust  privacy  set- tings. So for most users, the defaults work in  the  company’s  favor. Those  most  immersed  in the cultures and practices of social media,  teenagers  and  young  adults,  are  often  the  most sophisticated and aware of data harvest- ing practices  boyd and Marwick, 2011 .  In  the  current  commercial,  political,  and  regulatory  environment,  institutions  have  powerful incentives to collect, save, and ana- lyze  every  trace  of  human  activity.  These  incentives  are  not  entirely  new,  of  course.  People  have  long  been  aware  of  the  poten- tial  payoffs  of  tracing  and  tracking  subjects    consumers,  citizens,  criminals,  ‘users’ .  To  explain  the  relatively  recent  turn  to  data  harvesting  as  a  tool  of  choice,  scholars  and  analysts have tended to emphasize the avail- ability  of  appropriate  technologies.  Among  these  are  huge  server  farms,  algorithms  designed  to  reveal  patterns  quickly  within  otherwise  meaningless  pools  of  data,  and  faster  bandwidth  and  processing  capacities.  But  this  techno-centric  analysis  misses  or  downplays the role of significant changes in  the  global  political  economy  and  dominant  ideologies since 1980. When securities mar- kets and consultants praise ‘efficiency’ above  all other values, when states place ‘security’  above all other public needs, and when mass- market  advertising  reaps,  at  best,  murky  returns for each dollar spent, the incentives to  target, trace, and sift grow stronger.  When  we  examine  the  intentional  opac- ity of such private surveillance systems and  their  vulnerability  to  capture  by  state  secu- rity  systems,  we  can  forge  a  new  sense  of  the privacy challenge in a socially mediated  environment.  No  longer  can  we  rely  on  the  model  of  the  ‘panopticon,’  the  all-seeing  central eye that forces us to acknowledge it,  thus  curbing  our  desires  to  act  outside  the  norm   Foucault,  1995 .  Those  who  write  about  privacy  and  surveillance  often  invoke  the  Panopticon  to  argue  that  the  great  harm  of mass surveillance is social control. Yet the  Panopticon  does  not  suffice  to  describe  our  current predicament. First, mass surveillance  does  not  necessarily  inhibit  behavior:  peo- ple often will act as they wish regardless of  the number of cameras pointed at them. The  thousands of surveillance cameras in London  and New York City do not deter the eccentric  and avant-garde, nor is there significant evi- dence  that  they  deter  crime   Greenberg  and  Roush,  2009;  Welsh  and  Farrington,  2009 .  There is no empirical reason to believe that  awareness of surveillance limits the imagina- tion or stifles creativity in a market economy  in an open, non-totalitarian state.  Instead  we  must  confront  a  hidden  and  that   distributed  system  of  surveillance    220  encourages  us  to  find  niche  interests  and  express  ourselves  loudly  and  sincerely.  The  ideologies  of  Facebook,  Google,  and  even  Amazon guide us toward such niche expres- sion. And 21st-century security services hope  that we align ourselves with the fringe groups  while assuming that no one is paying atten- tion.  Our  current  condition  is  therefore  not  at  all  like  living  under  the  gaze  of  a  pano- pticon.  Instead,  we  live  within  an  invisible  network  or  surveillance  agents,  both  public  and private. It’s cryptic. So it’s a cryptopticon   Vaidhyanathan, 2015 .  adverTisemenTs  Google  and  Facebook  play  very  different  roles  in  users’  social  media  ecosystems.  People use Facebook to keep up with family,  friends, and colleagues. Facebook provides a  news  feed  that  displays  items  of  demon- strated interest to users and allows people to  discuss and debate the subjects that appear in  those  feeds.  Google,  on  the  other  hand,  serves as a source of knowledge. People seek  answers,  directions,  recipes,  and  advice  through  Google.  People  seek  products  as  well. Over time, Google has been much more  successful  than  Facebook  at  leveraging  its  data  riches  to  target  advertisements  effec- tively.  But  Facebook  has  recently  improved  its ability to target and tailor advertisements.  Seeking advertisement revenue from compa- nies  is  the  chief  way  in  which  these  two  companies  compete. While  Facebook  is  the  model of a successful social media company,  Google  provides  services  that  could  be  described  as  successfully  ‘social’  only  through its YouTube platform, through which  people subscribe to the feeds of their favorite  video producers. Google, while largely fail- ing as a social media enterprise, has set the  standard  and  served  as  a  model  for  selling  advertisements through auction. Firms of all  sizes  can  find  consumers  through  Google.  And  since  Facebook  has  adopted  similar   practices it has also served that market well.  These companies have significantly changed  the advertising world and thus all the media  economies  that  depend  on  advertisement   Auletta, 2009; Bell, 2016; Levy, 2011 .  Targeted  advertisements  that  reflect  the  various preferences expressed by users have  the  potential  to  shape  not  only  consumer  behavior  but  culture  as  well.  If  consum- ers  are  guided  toward  dependable  products  and brands that reflect the desires they have  already  expressed,  they  are  unlikely  to  explore. If abused, the power to guide users  toward  particular  products  could  generate  anti-trust  or  competition  issues.  Even  if  not  abused,  users  are  subject  to  being  profiled  and  funneled.  And  mass  markets  could  be  hard  to  define  and  exploit. A  user’s  diet  of  news  and  information  is  filtered  through  an  opaque  system  in  which  biases  are  undis- closed  and  unacknowledged.  Even  prices  could differ between consumers for the same  product  based  on  different  data  points  and  histories  Turow, 2006, 2011 .  The  phenomenon  of  targeted  advertise- ments  has  pulled  other  media  companies  closer to Facebook and its corporate sibling,  Instagram. Newspaper and magazine compa- nies see advantages to entering into partner- ships that would allow Facebook to host the  content in exchange for a portion of advertis- ing revenue generated  Fitts, 2015 .  conTenT discriminaTion  Advertisement-based  partnerships  between  news  organizations  and  social  media  plat- forms  run  the  risk  of  determining  which  news sources reach certain people based on  the desires of the companies involved rather  than  the  desires  or  needs  of  the  user.  This  undermines  efforts  to  use  digital  media  to  construct  a  rich  and  dynamic  public  sphere  through  which  civic  engagement  could  thrive. By working through Facebook, media  companies  have  relinquished  any  influence    the inCoMPlete PolitiCal eConoMy oF soCial Media   221  or control over who gets to see their content.  This  is  a  significant  shift  in  power   Bell,  2016 .  There are two methods of content discrim- ination within major social media platforms.  We  will  limit  our  discussion  to  Facebook  because it plays an outsized role in the news  and  information  diet  of  users.  Twitter,  for  example,  does  not  deploy  the  methods  that  follow,  as  of  the  summer  of  2016. The  first  method is filtering. Facebook positions items  that  its  users  have  shared   from  sites  out- side  the  Facebook  ecosystem   or  produced  themselves   photos,  text,  video   within  the  news feeds of others. Those others could be  ‘friends’ or merely ‘followers’ of the person  who  posted  the  content.  Facebook  algorith- mically  assesses  the  relevance  or  level  of  interest that the second person would have in  the first person’s posted content. Facebook’s  algorithms  could  consider  factors  such  as  shared  interest   both  parties  have  posted  similar  or  the  same  item  frequently  in  the  past , shared friends  both parties are active  on some mutual ‘friend’s’ site and posts , or  shared  proximity   to  a  community  of  inter- est  or  a  geographic  location .  Facebook  is  notoriously  secretive  about  the  values  it  embeds  in  its  algorithm.  But  we  know  that  over  time,  users  form  homophilous  clusters  and increasingly interact with each other. As  each  member  of  this  cluster  expresses  her- self or himself in richer and more elaborate  ways, Facebook is able to make more granu- lar judgments about what sort of material the  person would like to see. If a person ‘Likes’  something, Facebook gives that person more  of it. As Facebook structures usage, users see  a  narrower  and  narrower  selection  of  mate- rials.  This  creates  the  notorious  ‘filter  bub- ble,’ through which users increasingly retreat  into  ideological  or  other  interest  clusters  and  refrain  from  interacting  with  those  sig- nificantly different than themselves. This, of  course, has serious political, social, and cul- tural implications  Pariser, 2011 .  The second method of content discrimina- tion is a function of direct editing, which often   demands  human  intervention.  Female  users  of both Facebook and Instagram have found  content  removed  and  accounts  closed  after  posting images or references to breast cancer,  breastfeeding,  or  menstruation.  In  general,  both  Facebook  and  Instagram  work  to  limit  the  exposure  of  women’s  bodies  unless  the  users are celebrities or models. Women with  more  common  body  shapes  often  find  their  images  suppressed.  In  addition,  there  have  been accounts of images of refugees, warfare,  and political groups being removed for vio- lating  vague  guidelines   Chen,  2014; York,  2016 .  Because  Facebook  has  an  interest  in  limiting  public  criticism  or  inviting  state  censorship, it also has an interest in policing  its  own  content  in  often  clumsy  ways. This  practice generates problems because so many  people now depend on Facebook to mediate  their social and political lives.  social engineering in india  In  January  2012  Facebook  released  its  first  shares  through  an  initial  public  offering  of  stock.  Founder  and  chief  operating  office  Mark Zuckerberg took that moment to issue  a manifesto for his company. ‘Facebook was  not  originally  created  to  be  a  company,’  Zuckerberg  wrote.  ‘It  was  built  to  accom- plish  a  social  mission  –  to  make  the  world  more  open  and  connected’   Zuckerberg,  2012 .  Zuckerberg’s  commitment  to  corpo- rate social responsibility, to making the world  a better place through connectivity, has found  expression  in  his  company’s  endeavors  to  expand its market into areas of the world in  which significant numbers of people lack the  access, skills, and money to sustain a digital  presence.  Corporate social responsibility has risen in  importance  to  global  business  culture  since  the 1970s. It has served as an organizational  principal among corporate leaders who were  not  only  concerned  about  their  companies’  influence  on  the  Apartheid  government  of    222  South  Africa,  environmental  disasters  such  as  the  deadly  chemical  accident  at  Bhopal,  India, and struggles against ethnic and gender  discrimination,  but  also  about  the  image  of  their companies in the minds of a consuming  public  increasingly  concerned  about  injus- tices around the world. Debates around cor- porate social responsibility have centered on  the question of sincerity, of course. Are com- panies that engage in such promotions really  concerned  about  human  rights  and  a  clean  environment  or  are  their  efforts  merely  a  marketing ploy? Within business culture and  the scholarship on corporate social responsi- bility, the central question has been about the  efficacy of such campaigns: Can a company  leverage its efforts to be responsible to meas- urably improve its image and thus its stand- ing in a market? Can companies have it all?   Vogel, 2006   Facebook’s  corporate  social  responsibil- ity  stances  reflect  the  common  assumption  among  American  technology  companies,  including  Google  and  Microsoft,  that  there  is  no  zero-sum  choice  between  serving  the  interests of humanity and serving their share- holders. What is good for humanity is good  for  Facebook,  and  vice  versa.  Such  firm  belief in one’s righteousness is both liberat- ing and powerful. It can create a public mes- sage  that  generates  admiration  from  users,  consumers,  regulators,  workers,  and  com- petitors  Vaidhyanathan, 2011 .  In India, Facebook found the limits of its  self-regard.  In  2014  Facebook  launched  a  service it called ‘Internet.org.’ The choice of  that  brand  name  indicated  that  it  should  be  considered  distinct  from  Facebook  itself.  It  would  be  about  ‘the  Internet’  itself,  rather  than  one  social  media  company.  And  it  should be considered a not-for-profit venture   .org   rather  than  a  commercial  one   .com .  The  service  was  essentially  an  application  interface  –  sort  of  a  mobile  operating  sys- tem – that would work on any mobile device  that  allowed  data  connectivity.  The  operat- ing system would allow access to a handful  of Facebook-selected applications, including   the Bing search engine  Microsoft’s competi- tor  to  Google  and  many  other  home-grown  search  engines ,  women’s  rights  services,  employment  services,  Wikipedia  for  refer- ence, and weather information.  Importantly,   these  services  would  be  offered  at  ‘zero  rating,’  meaning  that  using  data  through  them  would  not  count  against  the  paid  data  one  would  purchase  for  a  mobile  account.  Using  a  competing  service  such  as  Google  or  an  employment  service  not  selected  by  Facebook  would  cost  data  and thus money for the user. If the user could  not afford a data plan – and this service was  ostensibly targeted at just those users – they  would have to use the services that Facebook  selected for Internet.org. Because zero-rating  services necessarily favor some data streams  over others they violate the principle of net- work  neutrality  that  has  been  invoked  as  central  to  the  development  and  success  of  Internet  practices  and  industries  around  the  world.  Regulators  have  thus  been  busy  try- ing  to  determine  to  what  extent  zero  rating  violates  their  laws  and  policies   Electronic  Frontier Foundation, 2016; Nowak, 2016 .  In  each  country   in  which  Facebook  launched  Internet.org   42  countries  by  July  2016 , Facebook enters into a partnership with  one mobile service provider. Facebook prom- ises that offering this service at no charge to  consumers who do not currently have mobile  data  plans  will  inspire  future  paid  use  as  users’ financial status improves. This pledge  rests upon the unquestioned assumption that  access to information improves the prospects  of users and the communities in which they  live and work  Bhatia, 2016 .  This  challenge  to  network  neutrality  thus  accompanies a more traditional threat to com- petition. India, unlike some of the other coun- tries  in  which  Facebook  launched  Internet. org,  has  deep  traditions  of  democratic  par- ticipation  and  a  highly  competitive  private  technology  and  telecommunications  sector.  Indian  entrepreneurs  would  like  to  compete  in  areas  such  as  mobile  health  information,  search engines, and social media. And India    the inCoMPlete PolitiCal eConoMy oF soCial Media   223  has  a  vibrant  collection  of  public  interest  activists who have been pushing to limit intel- lectual property protection for American and  European firms while fighting for free speech  and  privacy  protections  through  digital  net- works. So when Facebook brought Internet. org  to  India  in  2014,  complete  with  meet- ings between Zuckerberg and newly elected  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a massive  public  relations  campaign,  it  did  not  expect  that it would fail. Facebook officials not only  underestimated  the  opposition  within  India,  they failed to pay attention to the particulars  of the Indian political economy.  Public interest activists were adept at using  social  media  services  –  including  Facebook  but especially YouTube and Twitter – to rally  support for network neutrality and opposition  to  what  they  saw  as  an  arrogant  move  by  a  powerful American company in cahoots with  Modi.  Facebook  officials,  in  contrast,  were  not nearly as effective as their opponents at  deploying  social  media  in  their  campaign  to  convince  users  and  voters  that  their  ser- vice would benefit India more than it would  Facebook  Bhatia, 2016 .  Everything Facebook officials did in their  effort  to  thwart  a  strong  network  neutral- ity  ruling  by  telecommunications  regula- tors  backfired.  Billboards  asking  citizens  to  ‘support  a  connected  India’  glowered  at  motorists  stuck  in  traffic  in  cities  across  India. Facebook users in India were greeted  by  messages  on  the  service  asking  them  to  send emails to regulators in support of Free  Basics, what Facebook had renamed Internet. org  in  2015.  But  regardless  of  whether  a  Facebook  user  actually  agreed  to  send  an  email  to  regulators,  Facebook  would  adver- tise  to  that  user’s  ‘friends’  that  he  or  she  had  done  so.  This  angered  many  Facebook  users. Ultimately, 16 million emails reached  regulators,  but  their  staff  complained  that  these  automatically  generated  emails  failed  to  address  the  specific  questions  they  had  posed  through  the  public  comment  pro- cess. News coverage focused on the clumsi- ness  and  high- handedness  of  the  Facebook   campaign. Technology leaders noted the tone  that Facebook was using with India and com- pared it to the promises that British East India  Company  leaders  had  deployed  in  the  early  days of the colonial project  Bhatia, 2016 .  Complicating  such  matters,  Facebook  officials  made  tone-deaf  statements.  Chief  Operating Office Sheryl Sandberg published  an op-ed in the Indian Express newspaper in  which  she  proclaimed  that  access  to  digital  services can empower poor women to change  their status  Sandberg, 2015 . Unfortunately,  the changing status of women is a controver- sial  subject  in  India,  so  the  op-ed  served  to  alienate many traditional Hindus who voted  for Modi to maintain traditional social rela- tions  intact.  And  economic  competition  is  fierce  for  opportunities  and  resources  as  India’s  middle  class  has  swelled  over  the  past  30  years.  So  the  prospect  of  invit- ing  more  poor  people  into  the  middle  class  did  not  appeal  to  many  families  that  just  recently purchased a scooter or an education.  Sandberg and Facebook certainly meant well.  But they were dealing with a society they did  not understand, and one in which many of its  citizens  do  not  mean  each  other  well.  And  the  ruling  BJP  party  represents  just  those  citizens.  Immediately after Facebook lost its effort  to  stem  strong  network  neutrality  in  India,  Facebook  board  member  Marc  Andreesen,  the founder of Netscape and a current venture  capitalist,  sent  a  Tweet  complaining  about  the  decision:  ‘Denying  world’s  poorest  free  partial Internet connectivity when today they  have  none,  for  ideological  reasons,  strikes  me as morally wrong.’ In response to several  Tweeted replies to this complaint, Andreesen  proclaimed, ‘Anti-colonialism has been eco- nomically catastrophic for the Indian people  for  decades.  Why  stop  now?’  This,  under- standably,  set  off  a  storm  of  resentment  against Andreesen. Facebook officials quickly  distanced  the  company  from  Andreesen’s  expression.  And  later  that  day  Andreesen  apologized  for  the  Tweet  and  promised  to  refrain  from  discussing  the  history  and    224  politics of India on Twitter  Narayan, 2016 .  The Andreesen affair offered a glimpse into  the ideology that too often guides decisions  and  campaigns  dictated  from  Silicon Valley  yet meant to benefit people far from its levels  of wealth and power.  Examining  the  story  of  Facebook’s  fail- ures  to  introduce  Free  Basics  to  India  demonstrates  the  need  for  a  sophisticated,  multi-faceted, and open approach to the study  of political economy. Facebook is not just a  social  media  platform  that  operates  on  the  Internet  and  mobile  devices.  It  has  designs  to  represent  or  stand  in  for  the  Internet  and  mask its intentions behind proclamations of  public service. If it can’t get Facebook.com  in  front  of  millions  of  underprivileged  peo- ple, it will try to convince them that Internet. org is a good enough Internet for now.  This  story  is  one  of  a  wealthy  and  pow- erful company morphing and metastasizing.  Traditional political economy theory fails to  account  for  failure  –  specifically  failure  in  part caused by activists using Facebook and  competing social media platforms better than  the master can use his own tools. Facebook’s  relationships  with  states,  users,  and  other  commercial  services  are  dynamic  and  tem- poral.  Traditional  political  economy  theory  fails to fully describe or challenge a company  like Facebook as it enters its second decade  of dominance.  beyond social media: The  operaTing sysTem of our lives  Social media are no longer just social media.  And all media firms and services are attempt- ing to become ‘social.’ The permeable mem- branes among media services make accounts  of social media done at a theoretical distance  challenging.  Observations  and  accounts  of  the  political  economy  of  Facebook  in  2010  might not be relevant in 2020. What if ‘social  media’ – and in fact ‘media’ – become some- thing much more pervasive and powerful in   our lives over the next 20 years? Will politi- cal economy theory be able to keep up?  Consider  the  four  most  powerful  digital  companies in the United States  I am exclud- ing Weibo, Ali Baba, Yandex, VK, and other  powerful  and  important  social  media  and  Web  search  companies  in  places  like  China  and Russia where Google and Facebook have  struggled  to  establish  markets :  Facebook,  Alphabet  the holding company for Google ,  Microsoft,  and  Apple.  As  of  2016  these  four  companies  compete  for  highly  trained  and  experienced  labor.  And  they  compete   and  collaborate   for  political  influence  in  Washington, DC and Brussels. But they are  not direct competitors. Facebook and Google  do compete for Web and mobile advertising.  But they harvest and sell our attention in dif- ferent  ways  because  we  use  these  services  in different ways. Apple still sells hardware  for  its  core  business.  Microsoft  still  sells  software  to  make  most  of  its  money. Areas  of crossover competition, such as Bing with  Google or Google + with Facebook, have not  amounted to much beyond token efforts.  But each of these companies ha mounted  efforts to achieve dominance in the next fron- tier  of  digital  commerce:  the  data  streams  that would monitor, monetize, and govern our  automobiles, homes, appliances, and bodies. Often  erroneously  referred  to  as  ‘the  Internet  of  Things’  despite  not  resembling  the  Internet  or  being  chiefly  about  things,  these four companies are striving to become  the operating system of our lives. Data, they  predict, will soon flow from our clothing, our  vehicles, and thus our bodies. The operating  system of our lives is actually about people.  As they steadily introduce personal assistants,  new interfaces, thermostats, self- driving cars,  glasses, watches, and virtual reality goggles,  these  companies  hope  to  earn  the  trust  of  consumers and regulators such that they can  set the standards for the transactions that can  make this operating system work seamlessly  and efficiently. If they realize this vision, there  would be no clear distinction between media  and non-media. There would be no distinction    the inCoMPlete PolitiCal eConoMy oF soCial Media   225  between content and objects. All objects and  all bodies would be mediated content.  Such a prospect should alarm scholars of  the  political  economy  of  media.  How  shall  we  confront  such  an  effort?  How  shall  we  muster  a  vocabulary,  a  set  of  theories,  and  a set of rhetorical tools sufficient for such a  challenge? Such a prospect makes the debate  over  whether  Facebook’s  users  add  surplus  value under Marxist theory rather quaint.  Why veblen maTTers  Theory performs two major functions in intel- lectual  life.  As  in  the  natural  sciences  and  economics,  theories  attempt  to  so  fully  account for a phenomenon as to dependably  predict  the  nature  of  change.  If  the  theory  fails  to  predict  results,  scientists  revise  or  reject the theory. Over time a theory morphs  into something more useful than the theory it  replaced  Kuhn, 1970; Popper, 1959 . In the  realm  of  the  study  of  societies  and  cultures,  theories  are  useful  as  heuristics,  shorthand  methods  of  explanation. They  help  us  focus  our explorations and debates, providing ques- tions and assumptions that save us time and  energy. The  risk  of  social  and  cultural  theo- ries lies in our dependence on them. Affection  for  a  particular  theoretical  framework  can  limit the questions we ask and the subjects we  explore  a  bit  too  well.  We  risk  bracketing  particular aspects of a subject of study to the  exclusion  of  others,  and  thus  we  can  fail  to  appreciate  and  account  for  the  relationship  between an aspect that ‘counts’ to a theoreti- cal  school  and  one  that  does  not.  So,  for  example, we might be obsessed with defining  the  extent  to  which  social  media  users  per- form  unpaid  labor  on  behalf  of  exploitative  firms  all true and important  yet ignore ques- tions of whether that relationship flows from  cultural  or  affective  desires  that  are  being  widely  or  deeply  satisfied  through  the  plat- form. Investment in traditional political econ- omy  theory  does  not  fully  account  for   complex and contradictory motivations, shifts  in user norms and behavior over time, relative  success  and  failure  or  particular  firms  and  platforms,  and  differences  in  how  certain  groups   ethnicities,  genders,  sexualities,  age  cohorts,  etc.   perform  their  roles  in  social  media differently. What might serve us better  is  a  fusion  of  Marxian  political  economy  theory  with  what  Mills   1959   called  ‘the  sociological  imagination,’  a  historical  vision  that  appreciates  the  long  curve  of  human  expression,  and  an  anthropological  bend.  Fortunately, we have a model for such a style.  It lies in the diverse work of Thorstein Veblen. Veblen lived from 1857 to 1929. An econo- mist  and  sociologist,  he  witnessed  a  time  of  rapid  technological  change,  globalization,  imperialism,  and  concentrations  of  wealth.  His chief contribution to economic theory was  a  critique  of  the  Newtonian  assumptions  of  neoclassical economics. Neoclassical analysis  sees economic factors such as wages and prices  seeking  equilibrium,  as  if  guided  by  laws  of  thermodynamics  within  closed  systems.  Instead,  Veblen  argued,  economists  should  take  inspiration  from  Darwin’s  accounts  of  change, stasis, successes, and failures among  species  Veblen, 1904; Veblen and Horowitz,  2002 . This attention to flow, change, and con- tingency should be embedded within an appre- ciation of the role of norms and values. People  can  make  economic  choices  based  on  irra- tional or useless values – but they are relevant  values  nonetheless.  From  these  arguments  Veblen  derived  the  familiar  concept  of  ‘con- spicuous consumption’ to describe economic  decisions made to establish or proclaim status  for  the  sake  of  status   Veblen,  1905; Veblen  and Mills, 1953 .  Veblen’s  work  inspired  a  school  of  eco- nomic  thought  that  strongly  challenged  both  neoclassical  theory  and  Marxist  historical  materialism.  Institutional  economics  put  its  emphasis on transactions – commercial, politi- cal, and personal – and externalities – social,  environmental, and cultural. It took seriously  the persistence of communal values, and thus  merged anthropology with political economy.    226  It  also  considered  technological  change,  and  thus merged historical analysis with political  economy. For Veblen and those inspired by his  approach  and  style,  including  John  Kenneth  Galbraith   1958 ,  C.  Wright  Mills   1956 ,  Deirdre McCloskey  2008  and Robert Frank   1985 ,  political  economy  is  never  about  abstracting  data  and  research  questions  from  the  greater  ecosystems  of  collective  human  behavior.  Veblen  did  not  prescribe  a  method  of  analysis. Instead, his style serves as a model  for  interrogation  and  interpretation  that  goes  beyond  a  facile  call  for  ‘interdisciplinarity.’  It  lives  in  a  diverse,  polyphonic  world.  So  it  struggles  to  make  sense  of  a  diverse,  poly- phonic  world.  It’s  pragmatic,  in  the  sense  that  it  eschews  metaphysics  and  focuses  on  contingency.  And  it  told  stories,  because  it  maintained  a  concern  with  both  statics  and  dynamics. It was both empirical and theoreti- cal, but never naively positivist or historicist.  Consider what an analysis of the Free Basics  campaign in India would look like with Veblen  guiding  it.  A  standard  Marxian  approach  would  limit  the  investigation  to  questions  of  ownership of the means of distribution and the  modes  of  control  that  Facebook  would  have  exercised over millions of Free Basics users.  It would have generated a flat explanation of  why Facebook failed: Indian telecommunica- tion companies lined up on opposite sides of  the regulatory question of whether Free Basics  violated  network  neutrality  and  the  more  politically  powerful  companies  prevailed.  It  also might invoke the anti-imperialist  or pro- protectionist  or  nationalist   backlash  against  Facebook’s heavy-handed approach.  A  fuller  scholarly  project,  inspired  by  Veblen, would look for latent cultural values  that might have influenced the protests against  Facebook and for network neutrality. It would  examine the content of the comments received  by  telecommunication  regulators.  It  would  include  interviews  with  activists  about  their  motivations  and  tactics.  It  would  consider  the long historical story of Indian technology  firms  and  their  efforts  to  establish  markets  under the shadow of larger American firms.  As we confront a global phenomenon like  ‘social media,’ which always shifts and sifts  through our analytical fingers, we should keep  in mind that our theories must shift as well.  We  should  embrace  multiple  approaches  to  the study of political economy. We should be  open to abandoning the familiar and engag- ing with the unfamiliar. And we should move  beyond doctrinal debates that freeze the sub- ject we hope to confront.  references  ‘17  U.S.  Code  §  512  –  Limitations  on  Liability  Relating to Material Online.’ LII   Legal Infor- mation Institute.

The  favorite  button,  symbolized  by  a  star  and  once  a  main  feature  and  part  of  Twitter’s brand identity, was changed into a  much  more  generic  like  button,  indicated  with a heart symbol. Described by the press  as ‘one of the biggest changes to its platform  yet’   Clifton,  2015 ,  the  Twitter  change  caused  a  storm  of  reactions  from  its  end-users:  ‘I  hate  the  twitter  heart  so  hard’  –   @twocitylife,  Nov 3, 2015 ’1  ‘Twitter’s  acting  like  they  invented  the  heart’  –    @kumailn, Nov 3, 2015 ’2  ‘Wait! What? When did they replace the favorite  star with a heart? I’m now too scared to favorite in  case  somebody  gets  idea’  –    @ForresterRobert, Nov 3, 2015 3  the  wrong   ‘I’m actually sad to see the “heart” feature on the  mobile app. I’d hate to see Twitter start to lose its  essence. I hope this is temporary’ –  @deray, Nov  3, 2015 ’4  ‘Twitter  changing  the  “favorite”  star  to  a  “like”  heart is everything that is wrong with capitalism, in  icon form’ –  @room34, Nov 3, 2015 .5  Even Twitter engineers themselves seemed  to  be  in  disarray:  ‘I  work  at  @twitter  but  even I can’t believe how we replaced a com- pletely  value-neutral  term  like  “favorite”  with  something  so  loaded’   @peterseibel,  Nov 3, 2015 .6 A feature is clearly not just  a feature. The symbols and the connotations  they carry matter. Pressing a button means  something;  it  mediates  and  communicates,  or, as we will focus in this chapter, relates  to  different  affordances.  While  this  plat- form  change  may  seem  trivial  –  a  contro- versy  in  the  heat  of  the  moment  –  it  also  shows  how  features  are  objects  of  intense  feelings.  Features  are  ‘communicational  actors’  in  the  sense  that  they  ‘produce    234  figure 13.1  a Twitter user reacts to the change from stars to hearts.  meanings  and  meaningfulness’   Langlois,  2014:  52 .  That  is,  as  software-produced  visual  elements  on  an  interface,  features  such  as  the  favorite  and  like  button  say   and suggest things. What exactly these fea- tures  suggest  –  or  afford  –  is  not  set  once  and  for  all.  Clearly  these  features  suggest   the  action  of  clicking  the  button,  but  they  also  assign  a  variety  of  other  possibilities  and  interpretations.  As  the  user  reactions  exemplify,  Twitter  buttons  are  endowed  with  different  meanings,  feelings,  imagin- ings and expectations. There is the official,  corporate,  attempt  at  stabilizing  the  mean- ings, ‘the heart is more expressive, enabling  you  to  convey  a  range  of  emotions  and  easily connect with people’  Kumar, 2015 .  According  to  this  logic,  the  favorite  does  not allow for the same kind of expressive- ness. However, many users seemed to disa- gree.  As  one  user  suggests,  ‘A  fav  means  more than a like’.7 For him the change only   ‘shows  the  homoginization  [sic]  of  the  Internet.  Everything  has  to  be  LIKES’   Ibid. .  Another  user  sees  it  in  this  way:  ‘Fav  never  meant  favourite  anyway.  It  means  “I  agree.”’,  “That’s  funny,  but  not  enough to RT.”, or “Let’s end the conversa- tion  here.”’8  Contrary  to  Twitter’s  official  statements, many users saw the favorite as a  more  versatile  feature  than  the  somewhat  generic  concept  of  like.  For  others,  it  was  precisely  the  fact  that  the  favorite  button  wasn’t a like that made the difference: ‘Fav  doesnt mean love like. Fav means I want to  look  at  the  tweets  after  some  time’.9  So  if  users  debunked  the  idea  of  a  heart  button  allowing a greater range of expressiveness,  why change the feature in the first place?  Ultimately  the  change  was  presented  by  the company to provide a clearer understand- ing of the function to new users: ‘We want  to make Twitter easier and more rewarding  to  use,  and  we  know  that  at  times  the  star    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   235  could  be  confusing,  especially  to  newcom- ers’  Kumar, 2015 . By changing the name  and icon of a feature linked to a core plat- form activity  ‘favoriting’ , Twitter not only  standardized a mode of engagement across  its  services   ‘liking’ ,  but  also  affected  the  perceived  range  of  possible  actions  linked to these features of the platform, or   its affordances.  In this chapter we want to reflect on the  concept  of  affordance  as  a  key  term  for  understanding  and  analysing  social  media  interfaces and the relations between technol- ogy and its users. The concept of affordance  is  multivalent.  Originally  developed  in  the  field  of  ecological  psychology   Gibson,  2015   and  later  adopted  in  design  studies   Norman, 1988 , the concept of affordance  is  generally  used  to  describe  what  mate- rial  artifacts  such  as  media  technologies  allow people to do. In outlining its specific  intellectual  trajectory  from  psychology,  to  technology  and  design  studies,  sociology,  and communication and media studies, our  intention is to focus on some of the many –  and sometimes conflicting – ways in which  affordance  has  been  conceptualized  and  operationalized  across  various  disciplinary  boundaries. Even within the field of media  and communication studies there is no single  way that scholars have come to understand  the  concept  of  affordance.  Following  the  renewed debates over affordances in recent  scholarship on social media  see Ilten, 2015;  McVeigh-Schultz  and  Baym,  2015;  Nagy  and  Neff,  2015 ,  this  chapter  addresses  some of the new directions in which media  and communication scholars have proposed  to  define  and  analytically  deploy  the  con- cept.  We  first  describe  five  different  –  but  related – ways in which affordance has been  conceptualized  and  subsequently  address  how it has been employed to analyse social  media in particular. We then outline a plat- form-sensitive approach to affordance as an  analytical  tool  for  examining  social  media  based on recent examples of changes to the  Twitter platform.  concepTualizing affordances  Affordances as a Relational  Property  The  concept  of  affordance  was  originally  conceived in ecological psychology by James  Gibson to designate all kinds of action possi- bilities  latent  in  the  physical  environment.  Gibson  first  used  affordance  to  refer  to  a  specific  kind  of  relationship  between  an  animal and the environment. For Gibson, ‘the  affordances  of  the  environment  are  what  it  offers  the  animal,  what  it  provides  or  fur- nishes,  either  for  good  or  will’   2015:  119,  emphasis  in  original .  Although  this  defini- tion seems to privilege what specific environ- mental  properties  have  to  offer  an  animal,  Gibson also emphasizes that affordances are  to  be  understood  as  a  relational  property:   ‘I mean by it something that refers to both the  environment and the animal in a way that no  existing term does’  2015: 119 . Gibson’s aim  was to propose a theory of visual perception  based on the ways in which different species  inhabit  their  surroundings.  In  his  seminal  book  The  Ecological  Approach  to  Visual  Perception,  first  published  in  1979,  Gibson  takes up the question of ‘how we see’, Gibson  was interested in exploring how ‘we see the  environment around us’, particularly in terms  of how ‘we see its surfaces, their layout, and  their colors and textures’  2015: xiii .  His key insight was that we do not perceive  the environment as such, but rather perceive  it  through  its  affordances,  the  possibilities  for action it may provide. Fire, for example,  affords  warmth,  illumination,  and  cooking,  but at the same time it may also afford injury  to  the  skin.  What  delineates  warmth  from  injury is not always clear and depends on the  species’ ability to detect the limit. What fire  affords, then, is not merely a question of its  physical properties, but its relation to a specific  organism.  As  Gibson  suggests,  affordances  ‘have to be measured relative to the animal’   2015:  120 .  This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  affordances  are  indefinite.  For  Gibson,    236  affordances are invariant, meaning that they  do  ‘not  change  as  the  need  of  the  observer  changes. The observer may or may not per- ceive or attend to the affordance, according to  his needs, but the affordance, being invariant,  is always there to be perceived’  2015: 130,  emphasis  in  original .  In  its  original  mean- ing, an affordance is conceived as a relational  property,  one  that  ‘points  both  ways,  to  the  environment  and  to  the  observer’   Gibson,  2015: 121 . The concept of affordance does  not imply we can do anything with anything  as  ‘different  layouts  afford  different  behav- iors for different animals […] Knee-high for  a  child  is  not  the  same  as  knee-high  for  an  adult, so the affordance is relative to the size  of the individual’  2015: 120 . As Gibson put  it,  ‘affordances  do  not  cause  behavior  but  constrain and control it’  1982: 411 .  Perceived Affordances  While  Gibson’s  ideas  have  been  hugely  influential in a variety of fields, the concept  of  affordance  was  most  notably  adapted  in  design  studies  and  the  field  of  Human– Computer  Interaction   HCI   through  the  writings of Donald Norman. First introduced  in  his  book  The  Psychology  of  Everyday  Things  1988  – which was later published as  The  Design  of  Everyday  Things   1990   –  Norman  defined  affordances  as  ‘the  per- ceived  and  actual  properties  of  the  thing,  primarily  those  fundamental  properties  that  determine just how the thing could possibly  be  used’   1988:  9 .  Writing  in  the  specific  context  of  cognitive  science  and  design,  Norman’s aim was to explore the relationship  between human cognition and the design of  devices and everyday things. As a cognitive  scientist, Norman was interested in how the  human  mind  works,  especially  in  terms  of  human  errors,  wanting  to  teach  people  how  to avoid making mistakes.  Norman proposes the concept of ‘perceived   affordance’  1990: 9, 1999: 38  to suggest that  designers  can  and  should  ‘indicate  how  the   user is to interact with the device’  1990: 8 .  As  Norman  contends,  ‘affordances  provide  strong  clues  to  the  operation  of  things  […]  Knobs  are  for  t urning  […]  Balls  are  for  throwing  or  bouncing.  When  affordances  are taken advantage of, the user knows what  to  do  just  by  looking’   1990:  9 .  Poorly  designed objects, so the message goes, would  cause  unnecessary  problems  for  their  users.  With Norman, the concept of affordance was  modified  from  Gibson’s  relational  approach  to accommodate design interests, suggesting  that artifacts could be designed to suggest or  determine  certain  forms  of  use  through  the  notion of ‘perceived affordances’  1990: 9 .  The  question  was  no  longer  how  organisms  see,  as  was  the  case  in  Gibson’s  work,  but  rather how certain objects could be designed  to encourage or constrain specific actions.  As others have noted  Maier et al., 2009;  McGrenere  and  Ho,  2000;  You  and  Chen,  2007 ,  Norman’s  conceptualization  of  affordance became widely adopted within the  design  community,  setting  the  standard  for  what  would  be  considered  good  design  and  usability.  For  many  designers  and  creative  professionals, it was thus Norman’s prescrip- tive  formulation,  not  Gibson’s  work,  which  introduced them to the concept of affordance   You and Chen, 2007: 26 . Unlike Gibson’s  relational  understanding  of  affordance,  Norman  describes  affordances  as  proper- ties  of  things.  Thus,  power  is  placed  in  the  hands  of  designers  who  have  the  power  to  enable and constrain certain action possibili- ties  through  their  design  choices.  Whereas  affordances  may  or  may  not  be  perceived  in Gibson’s view, according to Norman, the  key  is  whether  users  actually  perceive  the  intended  possibilities  for  action  inscribed  into  the  design  of  an  artifact. As  Norman’s  concept of perceived affordances highlights,  ‘affordances  are  of  little  use  if  they  are  not  visible to the users’  1999: 41 . This notion  of  perceived  affordances  has  been  hugely  influential  in  professional  user  experience  design and interface design, within the digital  media  and  tech  industries  where  Norman’s    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   237  framework still serves as the working defini- tion  of  affordance.  In  their  book  Universal  Principles  of  Design,  authors  Lidwell  et  al.  provide  design  guidelines  and  considera- tions through a number of concepts, includ- ing  affordance,  and  closely  follow  Norman  in  suggesting  that  ‘good’  affordances  can  enhance the usability of a design and influ- ence the way it is perceived  2010: 8–22 .  Technology Affordances  the  first   Affordances are not just limited to the visible  senses  but  can  also  be  felt  or  heard.  As  William  Gaver  suggests,  ‘affordances  are  primarily facts about action and interaction,  not  perception’   1996:  114 .  For  example,  ‘when door handles are turned the sound of  the latch may reveal the affordance of moving  the  door’   Gaver,  1991:  82–83 .  For  Gaver,  affordances  are  not  just  waiting  to  be  per- ceived;  rather  they  are  there  to  be  actively  explored.  Building  on  Gibson’s  relational  model of affordances, Gaver contributed one  of  thorough  explorations  of  affordances within the field of HCI with his  paper  on  ‘Technology Affordances’   Gaver,  1991; McGrenere and Ho, 2000 . According  to  Gaver,  affordances  ‘are  properties  of  the  world defined with respect to people’s inter- action  with  it’   1991:  80 .  It  implies  the  ‘complimentary  of  the  acting  organism  and  the acted-upon environment’  1991: 80 . As  Gaver  exemplifies:  ‘whether  a  handle  with  particular  dimensions  will  afford  grasping  depends  on  the  grasper’s  height,  hand  size,  etc. Similarly, a cat-door affords passage to a  cat but not to me’  1991: 80 .  Like Norman, Gaver thinks that technology  and an artifact suggest different actions, but  differs in his view that users know ‘what to  do just by looking’  Norman, 1988: 9 . Gaver  makes a separation between affordances and  the  perceptual  information  available  about  them,  suggesting  that  affordances  can  be  both  perceptible  and  hidden   1991:  80 .  In  the latter case, affordances must be inferred   from  other  evidence,  possibly  through  experimentation and other actions that make  affordances visible. In the case of a graphi- cal computer interface, for example, a hidden  affordance could be revealed by the action of  a mouse-over.  For  Gaver,  ‘affordances  exist  not  just  for  individual  action,  but  for  social  interaction  as  well’   1996:  114 .  While  the  ecological  approach to affordance stresses the relation- ship  between  the  natural  environment  and  the individual, ‘how individual activities are  shaped by the environment, and how individ- uals can orient to the relevant environmental  attributes’, Gaver is also concerned with ‘the  possibilities offered by the physical environ- ment for social interaction’  1996: 114 . He  points out, ‘these are not social affordances  […]  but  affordances  for  sociality’   1996:  114 .  In  writing  about  the  material  features  of  technology,  Gaver  speculates  about  the  differences  between  paper  and  electronic  media,  arguing  that  different  affordances  may have many effects on the social conven- tions that surround them. Contemplating the  role  of  email,  Gaver  describes  how  moving  from a high-bandwidth environment to a dial- up service dramatically changed the use and  culture  of  email.  ‘The  properties  of  email  systems may not determine the communities  that  eventually  form  around  them’,  Gaver  suggests, ‘but they do strongly constrain the  cultures  that  might  develop’   1996:  120 .  Although Gaver makes sure to distance him- self from accusations of technological deter- minism,  the  term  ‘technology  affordances’  establishes material qualities of technology as   partly  constitutive of sociality and commu- nicative actions in this view. Again, we need  to recognize the particular context and aim of  Gaver’s  conception  of  affordance.  Whereas  Gibson’s  aim  was  to  propose  a  theory  of  visual  perception  and  Norman’s  primary  concern was to enhance good design, Gaver  sought to ‘challenge researchers to avoid the  temptation  of  ascribing  social  behavior  to  arbitrary customs and practices, and to focus  instead on discovering the possibly complex    238  environmental factors shaping social interac- tion’  1996: 125 . In doing so, Gaver consid- ered the concept of affordances as a ‘useful  tool  for  user-centered  analyses  of  technolo- gies’  1991: 97 .  Social Affordances  Gaver’s  aim  of  pointing  researchers  to  the  ways  in  which  ‘social  activities  are  embed- ded  in  and  shaped  by  the  material  environ- ment’   1996:  125   might  have  paid  off  as  many sociologists and communication schol- ars  have  subsequently  used  the  notion  of  social  affordances  to  refer  to  ‘the  possibili- ties  that  technological  changes  afford  for  social  relations  and  social  structure’   Wellman, 2001: 228  to talk about the ways  in which ‘technology affords social practice’   Hsieh, 2012 . The term ‘social affordance’,  however, might also seem confusing as it is  primarily  used  to  talk  about  the  impact  of  technology,  how  technological  properties  enable  and  constrain  sociality  in  certain  ways.  Social  affordances  are  ‘the  social  structures that take shape in association with  a  given  technical  structure’   Postigo,  2016:  5 . Wellman et al.  2003  use the term to talk  about  the  ways  in  which  the  internet  may  influence everyday life. Similar to how Gaver  uses the notion of technology affordances to  describe the changes in email culture effectu- ated  by  moving  from  high-bandwidth  envi- ronment to a slower dial-up service, Wellman  et  al.   2003   use  the  notion  of  social  affordance to describe how changes in broad- band create new possibilities for communica- tion. Using opposite prefixes, they both seem  to be referring to the way in which technol- ogy affords sociality.  However,  the  notion  of  social  affordance  can also be understood in a much more gen- eral  or  relational  sense  without  necessarily  invoking  technology  explicitly.  According  to  Gibson,  ‘the  richest  and  most  elaborate  affordances of the environment are provided  by  other  animals  and,  for  us,  other  people’    2015:  126 . This  is  to  say  that  how  people  behave, move, or simply exist in an environ- ment afford important cues as to how others  should  behave,  move  or  co-exist.  Take  the  pedestrian sidewalk; people constantly adjust  their own movements to other people in their  pathway.  While  the  environment  may  give  structure to an organisms’ existence, Gibson  suggests  that  ‘behavior  affords  behavior’   2015: 127 . Importantly, ‘what the other ani- mal affords the observer is not only behavior  but also social interaction’  2015: 36 .  Communicative Affordance  Characteristic of many of the above concep- tualizations of affordances is the question of  how  technology  and  society  relate.  For  the  sociologist Ian Hutchby  2001a, 2001b , the  term  ‘affordance’  provides  a  way  to  move  beyond naïve technological determinism and  strict  social  constructivism.  Hutchby  sug- gests that affordance provides a middle term  that  both  takes  into  account  the  ways  in  which technologies are socially constructed  and situated on the one hand, and materially  constraining and enabling on the other hand.  Specifically,  Hutchby  develops  the  concept  of ‘communicative affordances’ referring to  the ‘possibilities for action that emerge from  […] given technological forms’  2001a: 30 .  This definition emphasizes how affordances  are  both  functional  and  relational;  ‘func- tional in the sense that they are enabling, as  well as constraining’ and relational in terms  of  drawing  ‘attention  to  the  way  that  the  affordances of an object may be different for  one species than for another’  Hutchby and  Barnett,  2005:  151,  emphasis  in  the  origi- nal . Moreover, ‘affordances can also shape  the conditions of possibility associated with  an  action:  it  may  be  possible  to  do  it  one  way, but not another’  Hutchby and Barnett,  2005: 151 .  For  Hutchby,  the  notion  of  communica- tive  affordances  is  best  understood  as  part  of  ordinary  actions.  While  Gibson  once    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   239  observed  that  ‘the  walk-on-ability  of  a  sur- face exists whether or not the animal walks  on it’, Hutchby and Barnett think ‘it is never- theless the case that the surface’s affordance  of  walk-on-ability  becomes  manifest  when  the animal walks on it’  2005: 152 . In other  words,  affordances  can  best  be  observed  in  the course of agential actions. In the context  of  media  and  communications  research,  the  actions that seem particularly apt to study are  the ones that imply communication of some  sort. Hence the relative usefulness of the term  ‘communicative  affordances’  as  opposed  to  the  very  similar  term  ‘social  affordances’.  While  both  of  these  terms  describe  the  ways  in  which  technology  enable  or  con- strain  social  action,  the  term  ‘communica- tive affordances’ focuses specifically on the  ‘impact  of  technology  for  communication’   Schrock, 2015: 1233 .  The term ‘communicative affordances’ has  most notably been used in research on mobile  media  Boase, 2008; Helles, 2013; Hutchby  and Barnett, 2005  as a way of describing how  mobile  devices  ‘alter  communicative  prac- tices or habits’  Schrock, 2015: 1232 . While  the  mobile  phone  has  often  been  described  as a device for ‘perpetual contact’  Katz and  Aakhus, 2002 , the affordance of availability  on this account first and foremost alters the  degrees and ways of being available. In terms  of mobility or portability, Helles usefully sug- gests  that  ‘the  central  affordance  of  mobile  phones is not the mobility of the device per  se, but rather the fact that the user becomes  a mobile terminus for mediated communica- tive interaction across the various contexts of  daily life’  2013: 14 . As Humphreys  2005   showed in her work on mobile use in public,  the range of social contexts in which mobile  communication takes place afford new forms  of  social  identity,  as  well  as  the  modifica- tion of tacit codes of social interactions. The  communicative  affordance  perspective  thus  moves away from Norman’s applied perspec- tive  of  seeing  affordances  as  features  and  instead  focuses  on  more  high-level  abstrac- tions of what mobile devices afford.  social media research   and affordances  As  a  concept  that  captures  the  relationship  between the materiality of media and human  agency,  affordance  continues  to  play  an  important  role  in  media  studies  and  social  media research specifically  see Ellison and  Vitak, 2015 . Work in this area often uses an  affordance approach to focus attention not on  any  particular  technology,  but  on  the  new  dynamics  or  types  of  communicative  prac- tices and social interactions that various fea- tures  afford.  Whereas  some  scholars  have  used  affordance  almost  synonymously  with  the  features  of  technology   Graves,  2007 ,  others have focused on the social structures  that are formed in and through a given tech- nology   Baym,  2010;  boyd,  2011;  Postigo,  2016 .  Within  the  literature,  social  network  sites and social media have often been ana- lysed  in  terms  of  having  ‘affordances  and  constraints’   e.g.,  Baym,  2010;  boyd,  2011;  Ellison and Vitak, 2015 .  High-Level and Low-Level  Affordances  Affordances  tend  to  be  conceptualized  on  either  one  of  two  distinct  dimensions:  an  abstract  high-level  or  a  more  concrete   feature-oriented  low-level.  High-level  affordances  are  the  kinds  of  dynamics  and  conditions enabled by technical devices, plat- forms  and  media. As  danah  boyd  argues  in  her work on social network sites as a form of  networked publics  2011: 39 , these sites are  essentially shaped by four central affordances:  persistence,  replicability,  scalability,  and  searchability   2011:  46 .  For  boyd,  these  high-level affordances of SNSs structure the  engagement  of  users  in  these  environments   2011:  39–40 .  Comparably,  Treem  and  Leonardi  2012  allocate four affordances of  social media use shaping organizational com- munication  processes:  visibility,  editability,    240  persistence and association. Looking at what  kinds  of  behaviours  social  media  afford  offers ‘one way researchers can transcend the  particularities  of  any  technology  or  its  fea- tures, and focus on communicative outcomes’   Treem  and  Leonardi,  2012:  147 .  Schrock  also  sees  affordances  as  something  much  broader than ‘buttons, screens and operating  systems’  2015: 1233 . For him, affordances  exist  on  a  higher-level,  as  exemplified  through the kinds of dynamics or conditions  enabled  by  the  mobile  phone.  For  Schrock,  these affordances include: portability, availa- bility,  locatability  and  mulimediality   2015:  1229 .  In  other  words,  what  mobile  media  afford  has  nothing  to  do  with  a  specific  button, but rather with the kinds of communi- cative  practices  and  habits  they  enable  or  constrain.  In  contrast,  low-level  affordances  are typically located in the materiality of the  medium, in specific features, buttons, screens  and  platforms.  Interestingly,  we  find  that  many  researchers  use  this  low-level  or  design-oriented notion of affordance more in  passing than in an analytical sense. As such,  affordance  becomes  a  way  of  talking  about  the  technical  features  of  a  platform,  for  example,  invoking  the  term  to  describe  Twitter’s 140-character limit or the ability to  share  a  link  using  a  tweet  button.  In  a  Gibsonian sense, technical features – under- stood as the furniture of the digital landscape –   afford  certain  actions,  such  as  clicking,  sharing or liking.  More  often  than  not,  however,  authors  seem to combine a high-level understanding  of  affordance  with  a  consideration  of  spe- cific  features  or  platforms.  As  boyd  argues  in  her  work,  higher-level  affordances  are  conditioned by the properties of bits, which  essentially  introduce  new  opportunities  for  interaction  and  communication   2011:  39 .  Comparably,  Ellison  and  Vitak   2015   advocate  for  considering  the  high-level  affordances  of  social  media  by  conjoining  this perspective with looking at specific fea- tures, such as the profile, to understand social  capital  processes.  Conversely,  Postigo  uses   a  low-level  or  feature-oriented  conceptual- ization of affordance as a means of studying  how YouTube’s platform features create ‘a set  of probable uses meanings practices for users  while  serving YouTube’s  business  interests’   2016: 332 . Postigo thus starts his analysis  by  describing  a  set  of  architectural  features  and  properties  of  the  YouTube  platform  in  order  to  describe  its  ‘social  affordances’   2016: 336 .  While all conceptualizations of affordance  take Gibson’s original framing of the term as  a starting point, they differ in terms of where  and when they see affordances materializing   i.e., features, artifacts, social structures  and  what affordances are supposed to activate or  limit   i.e.,  particular  communicative  prac- tices, sociality, publics, perception . By high- lighting  the  difference  between  high-level  affordances  and  low-level  affordances,  we  want to emphasize what we see as one of the  main ontological and epistemological differ- ences in how the concept of affordance gets  used.  The  Gibsonian  understanding  locates  affordances  in  the  relation  between  a  body  and  its  environment,  whereas  the  low-level  conception of affordance takes after Norman  by locating affordances in the technical fea- tures  of  the  user  interface   Sun  and  Hart- Davidson, 2014: 3537 .  Imagined Affordances  Despite the popularity and widespread usage  of  the  term  in  social  media  research,  recent  contributions  to  the  literature  on  affordance  have  called  for  more  precise  and  nuanced  definitions  of  the  term,  variously  proposing  additional concepts to better account for the  complex  relationships  between  technology  and  sociality   see  Ilten,  2015;  McVeigh- Schultz  and  Baym,  2015;  Nagy  and  Neff,  2015 .  Nagy  and  Neff,  for  instance,  have  introduced  ‘imagined  affordance’ as ‘a theory that better incorpo- rates  the  material,  the  mediated,  and  the  emotional  aspects  of  human–technology   the  notion  of    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   241  interaction’  2015: 2 . Imagined affordances,  Nagy  and  Neff  contend,  ‘emerge  between  users’  perceptions,  attitudes,  and  expecta- tions; between the materiality and function- ality  of  technologies;  and  between  the  intentions  and  perceptions  of  designers’   2015: 5 . For Nagy and Neff, ‘older’ notions  of affordance fail to address the complexity  of cognitive as well as emotional processes.  Simply locating the action possibilities of a  social media platform in a set of features will  not  do,  they  claim,  because  users’  percep- tions,  beliefs  and  expectations  of  what  the  technology  does  or  what  the  platform  sug- gests it is for ‘shape how they approach them  and  what  actions  they  think  are  suggested’   2015: 5 . Imagined affordances may not just  affect how users approach social media plat- forms, they may performatively help to shape  the platforms themselves. As Bucher  2016   argues in her research on users’ understand- ing  and  perceptions  of  algorithms  in  social  media  platforms,  the  ways  in  which  users  imagine  and  expect  certain  algorithmic  affordances, affect how they approach these  platforms. The feedback-loop characteristics  of  machine  learning  systems  like  Facebook  make user beliefs an important component   in  shaping  the  overall  system  behaviour,   as  end-user  activity  is  generative  of  the  sys tem itself.  Vernacular Affordances  In a similar vein, McVeigh-Schultz and Baym   2015   suggest  linking  the  materiality  of  social  media  platforms  to  the  sense-making  processes  of  users  when  conceptualizing  affordances.  Developing  the  notion  of  ‘ver- nacular  affordance’,  McVeigh-Schultz  and  Baym  emphasize  ‘how  people  themselves  understand  affordances  in  their  encounters  with  technology’   2015:  1 .  Instead  of  researchers or designers assigning affordances  to  social  media,  they  derive  the  affordances  from users discussing how they engage with  the  technology.  Such  a  perspective,  they   transparency’,   state,  infers  affordances  from  a  more  ‘ver- nacular’  account  of  the  users  themselves,  who may emphasize different aspects of the  action possibilities of a platform. Interviewing  key actors of NGOs involved in a campaign  entitled  ‘Free  Lunch  for  Children  in  China’   FL4C   on  the  Chinese  microblogging  plat- form Sina Weibo, researchers Zheng and Yu   2016   found  that  Weibo  affords  NGOs  to  scale  their  network,  frame  collective  action,  and  establish  the  legitimacy  of  their  cam- paign.  Schools  participating  in  the  FL4C  campaign had to post photographic evidence  of  the  lunches  provided  to  Weibo,  thereby  ‘enforcing  ‘enhancing  accountability’ and ‘enacting public scrutiny’   Zheng  and  Yu,  2016:  305 ,  affordances  which  only  revealed  themselves  through  interviews and observing the practices of the  actors involved in the campaign. In line with  audience  research  more  generally,  the  point  with  emphasizing  the  notion  of  vernacular  affordances is to show how action possibili- ties  cannot  be  determined  once  and  for  all,  but  need  to  be  grounded  in  people’s  own  perceptions  and  experiences.  As  McVeigh- Schultz and Baym argue in their study of how  people use and make sense of the dating app  Couple,  ‘affordances  are  not  experienced  in  isolation, but rather in relation to a complex  ecology of other tools with other affordances’   2015:  2 . Thus,  affordances  simultaneously  exist for people at multiple levels and across  platform boundaries.  re-assembling affordances  Our purpose with outlining the different con- ceptions  of  affordance  was  to  point  out  its  different  intellectual  history,  ontological  status and analytical value. It arguably makes  a difference which conception of affordance  is  used  –  as  it  puts  certain  epistemological  limits  on  what  can  be  known  about  affordances  and  where  to  find  them  in  the  first  place.  When  designers  and  designed    242  artifacts  are  given  priority,  affordances  are  seen  as  part  of  the  technological  design.  Following an understanding of affordance as  communicative, however, locates affordances  as  part  of  communicative  actions  and  can  best  be  studied  in  and  through  the  kinds  of  practices that technology allows for or con- strains.  Or,  in  the  case  of  vernacular  affordances, ways of knowing and analysing  affordances  requires  an  emphasis  on  users’  own  accounts  of  technology,  where  affordances  become  as  much  part  of  users’  experiences and perceptions of technologies  as of the technologies themselves.  A Relational and Multi-layered  Approach to Affordances  The different concepts outlined above seem to  focus on what technology does  to users, and  not, for instance, the other way around. Given  the  relational  ontology  of  Gibson’s  original  concept, it seems somewhat surprising that the  relationality  in  question  often  seems  to  be  applied rather unidirectional. The question is  seldom what end-users afford or do to technol- ogy  not to be confused with the question of  what users do with technology , or what plat- forms  afford  to  other  kinds  of  users  besides  end-users.  In  order  to  do  the  concept  of  affordance  justice,  we  need  to  think  much  more relationally and in a multi-layered way  about the concept, while retaining a sense of  platform-sensitivity  by  taking  the  medium- specificity  of  platforms  into  account.10  If  Actor-Network  Theory   ANT   and  similar  relational  approaches  to  the  relationship  between technology and the social have taught  us anything, isn’t it to think in a more fully- fledged manner about agency and connectiv- ity?  ANT,  while  not  a  coherent  approach,  holds that agency is distributed and relational,  and  that  nonhumans  are  actors  with  agency  too. As Latour suggests, the agency of nonhu- mans refers to the ways in which ‘things might  authorize,  allow,  afford,  encourage,  permit,  suggest,  influence,  block,  render  possible,   forbid, and so on’  2005: 72, emphasis added .  As Latour acknowledged in a footnote to this  much-cited reference on the idea of nonhuman  agency,  it  is  highly  indebted  to  Gibson’s  notion of affordances and the question of what  technology  does  to  users.  This  may  also  be  where  some  of  the  overemphasis  on  affordances  as  something  seemingly  tied  to  the  agency  of  technological  objects  comes  from. While the notion of nonhuman agency is  important in studying social media platforms,  we  should  also  not  lose  sight  of  the  multi- directionality  of  agency  and  connectivity  at  work in approaching questions of affordances.  If one way of thinking more relationally about  affordances  on  a  par  with  Gibson’s  original  conception  means  considering  agency  as  pointing ‘both ways, to the environment and to  the  observer’   2015:  121 ,  then  we  want  to  suggest that thinking in a more multi-layered  way  about  affordances  means  reconsidering  the  notion  of  the  interface  as  well. Although  providing  a  genealogy  of  the  notion  of  the  interface falls outside the scope of this chapter,  let  it  suffice  at  this  point  to  briefly  explain  what  we  mean  by  interface  and  why  it  is  important to our current discussions.  While  Gibson  saw  affordance  as  mani- fest in the surfaces and layout of the terres- trial environment, design studies and HCI in  many ways have treated this as being analo- gous to graphical user interfaces, button and  features  in  the  context  of  digital  environ- ments. Following Branden Hookway  2014 ,  however, we want to argue that surfaces and  interfaces  are  not  necessarily  the  same.  A  surface,  Hookway  suggests,  ‘exists  primar- ily as an aspect of that which it surfaces’; it  means ‘a facing above’  2014: 12 . The inter- face,  by  contrast,  ‘does  not  primarily  refer  back  to  a  thing  or  condition  but  rather  to  a  relation  between  things  or  conditions,  or  to  a  condition  as  it  is  produced  by  a  relation’   Hookway,  2014:  13–14 . While  we  do  not  want to go as far as Hookway in replacing all  references to a web interface and the vernac- ular  understanding  of  interface  as  the  place  of interaction between two systems with the    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   243  term  ‘surface’,  we  also  want  to  stress  that  interfaces are not confined to this notion of  a  surface  or  a  physical  boundary  of  sorts.  Following Hookway, interfaces should above  all be understood as ‘forms of relations’. If  interfaces  are  not  simply  surfaces  or  com- puter screens, what does it mean to consider  interfaces as sites of analysis for a study of  affordances? Previously, Mel Stanfill  2015:  3  has proposed a method for analysing web- sites  entitled  ‘discursive  interface  analysis’,  which takes a site’s affordances as a starting  point  in  order  to  analyse  how  they  produce  and  make  visible  particular  norms  of  use.  However,  following  Hookway   2014 ,  we  wish  to  emphasize  how  interfaces  produce  and  make  visible  particular  relations.  By  moving beyond the surface and to platforms’  distinct interfaces that mediate between dif- ferent  parties,  we  wish  to  draw  attention  not  only  to  how  affordances  present  and  structure  action  possibilities  for  end-users  in  the  graphical  user  interface,  but  also  to  how  ‘the  interface  privileges  the  question  of how a relation may come into being and  how  it  may  produce  behaviors  or  actions’   Hookway,  2014:  14 .  By  approaching  the  question of affordance from a relational and  multi-layered perspective, the question is not  just whose action possibilities we are talking  about,  but  also  how  those  action  possibili- ties come into existence by drawing together   sometimes  incompatible   entities  into  new  forms  of  meaningfulness.  That  is,  there  is  nothing that necessarily warrants the analo- gous  treatment  of  the  Gibsonian  animal  or  observer with the end-user. Correspondingly,  we might wonder where in the course of the  historical  trajectory  the  properties  of  the  natural  environment  that  Gibson  describes  became synonymous with devices, technolo- gies and the graphical user-interface?  Platforms as Environments  If the end-user is not necessarily equivalent  to  the  Gibsonian  animal,  then  who  or  what   constitutes  the  animals  of  social  media  and  how  are  we  to  think  of  the  environment  in  this case? For Gibson, the terrestrial environ- ment  with  its  terrestrial  features  of  paths,  cliffs,  barriers,  water  margins,  etc.  afford  various  ways  of  existing  relative  to  the  animal  in  question.  In  Gibson’s  terms,  the  ‘earth  has  “furniture”  […]  it  is  cluttered’   2015: 123 : ‘Like the furnishings of a room’,  the environment is cluttered with objects and  features, ‘it is what makes it liveable’  2015:  71 . For us, social media platforms constitute  a  form  of  environment  too,  composed  of  pathways and features in their own right. It is  important to point out, however, that no two  platforms  are  alike,  although  many  tend  to  use similar features and functionalities such  as likes, shares, comments or hashtags. While  we focus specifically on Twitter as a platform  in this chapter, and take its platform-specific- ity into account, the broader arguments about  considering  platforms  as  environments  with  its specific possibilities and constraints holds  true for any social media platform of study. Platforms,  in  their  computational  under- standing, are seen as infrastructures that can  be  programmed  and  built  on   Bogost  and  Montfort,  2009 .  In  the  context  of  Twitter,  this  programmability  is  facilitated  by  appli- cation programming interfaces  APIs , which  enable  interoperability  and  facilitate  third- parties to employ platform data and function- ality  Bodle, 2011; Bucher, 2013; Helmond,  2015 . At  the  same  time, APIs  enable  plat- forms  to  extend  into  the  web  by  setting  up  data  channels  that  make  external  web  data  flowing  back  to  their  databases  ‘platform  ready’ in order to fit the underlying economic  business  models  of  social  media  platforms   Helmond,  2015 .  Platforms  are  technolo- gies  or  services  that  mediate  interactions  and  relations  between  two  or  more  parties   Rochet and Tirole, 2003 , and social media  platforms  can  be  characterized  as  digital  intermediaries  that  draw  together  and  nego- tiate between different stakeholders, such as  end-users, developers and advertisers, which  each come with their own aims and agendas    244   Gillespie,  2010 .  Social  media  platforms  are  characterized  by  the  combination  of  their  infrastructural  model  as  programma- ble and extendable infrastructures, and their  economic  model  of  connecting  end-users  to  advertisers   Helmond,  2015 ,  where  the  ‘politics of platforms’ lies in the mediation of  these stakeholder relations  Gillespie, 2010 .  For example, Facebook’s Like button enables  Facebook  to  extend  into  websites  and  apps,  where  the  data  produced  on  and  collected  through  these  external  sources  is  sent  back  to the platform  Gerlitz and Helmond, 2013   and  made  available  to  advertisers  through  various  advertising  interfaces,  such  as  the  Facebook Marketing API.11  a plaTform-sensiTive approach  If platforms are specific kinds of digital envi- ronments,  and  affordances  reflect  the  com- plex co-evolution of users and environment,  how are we to make sense of such contextual  relationality in the concrete case of a social  media platform? In the following we take the  example of Twitter as a case in point to dis- cuss  what  we  term  a  platform-sensitive  approach to the affordances of social media.  The Case of Twitter Platform  Changes  Exactly  ten  years  ago  today,  on  21  March  2006, Twitter’s cofounder Jack Dorsey pub- lished  the  first  tweet  ever.12  Since  then,  Twitter  has  grown  into  the  most  popular  microblogging  platform  to  date,  with  320  million  monthly  users   Styles,  2016 .  Still,  the alleged ‘decay’ of Twitter has been regu- larly  pronounced,  particularly  in  light  of  its  loss of ‘sociability’  Burgess, 2015 , stalled  user  growth,  and  the  many  recent  platform  changes   see  Topolsky,  2016;  Tsukayama,  2016 . Commentators have noted how declin- ing user growth has prompted the platform to   change  some  of  its  most  prevalent  features  and  functionalities,  including  the  favorite  feature, as briefly discussed in the introduc- tion  of  this  chapter.  When,  in  November  2015, the favorite was changed into a like, it  was indeed presented as a way of making the  service  more  comprehensible  to  new  users   Kumar,  2015 . The  turn  to  hearts,  or  likes,  was also motivated by a desire to standardize  expressions  across  all  Twitter  products,  as  exemplified by Twitter’s spokesperson, who  put it in this way: ‘You’ve embraced hearts in  a big way on Periscope, and we’re delighted  to  bring  them  to  Twitter  and  Vine,  making  them  the  common  language  for  our  global  community’   Kumar,  2015 .  A  few  months  later, in February 2016, Twitter made another  major  change  by  enabling  a  new  timeline  ordering  in  which  end-users  would  now  receive  ‘the  best  Tweets  first’  by  default  in  order  to  ‘catch  up  on  the  best  Tweets  from  people you follow’  About your Twitter time- line,  n.d. .  This  change  essentially  trans- formed  the  curation  and  presentation  of  the  feed,  from  that  of  a  linear  progression  of  tweets  in  a  reverse-chronological  order  to  a  feed no longer exclusively organized around  a  linear  flow  of  time.  With  the  new  feed  introduced early in 2016, tweets would now  be  organized  around  various  popularity  and  affinity  metrics,  including  user  interaction  and  their  engagement  with  tweets  through  platform activities such as liking, retweeting  and  replying   About  your  Twitter  timeline,  n.d. . These two controversial changes were  heavily  discussed  on  technology  blogs  as  well as on Twitter itself, where the rumoured  introduction of what came to be widely dis- cussed  as  ‘the  algorithmic  timeline’  of  Twitter,  prompted  much  outrage  under  the  hashtag RIPTwitter.13 The question is what,  if  anything,  these  incidents  have  to  do  with  affordances? As we will argue, much, indeed. At first sight it might be tempting to inter- pret  Twitter’s  claim  that  the  favorite  button  is  confusing  to  use,  by  evoking  Norman’s  idea of good interface design. From a design- centred perspective the favorite button failed    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   245  to communicate how the feature should to be  used.  The  turn  to  hearts  and  likes  could  be  read as an attempt to enhance the perceived  affordances of the feature by indicating more  clearly  ‘how  the  user  is  to  interact  with  the  device’   Norman,  1990:  8 .  However,  if  we  tackle  the  question  from  the  perspective  of  communicative  or  vernacular  affordances  it  quickly  becomes  apparent  that  affordances  cannot simply be understood in terms of good  or bad design. What the many reactions to the  change and previous studies attest to is that  the favorite feature has been attributed various  affordances beyond their original purpose of  saving tweets you like  Stone, 2006 . In their  study of Twitter favoriting behaviour, Meier  et al.  2014  identified 25 distinct motivations  for using favorites, including showing agree- ment  and  relationship  building.  From  the  perspective of end-users, the favorite feature  does not simply afford bookmarking a tweet,  it also affords different types of sociality and  communicative  actions,  e.g.,  favoriting  as  a  form  of  communication  to  maintain  rela- tions, to show agreement, or to indicate the  end of a conversation  cf. Meier et al., 2014 .  The change to hearts and likes, while techni- cally not affording any new actions, certainly  seems  to  suggest  different  communicative  and social affordances. For some end-users,  the change from a favorite into a like feature  eradicated the wide range of ‘communicative  affordances’  previously  associated  with  the  favorite  Newton, 2015 . Others still, claimed  the  opposite,  suggesting  the  importance  of  taking users’ perspectives into account when  analysing  the  affordances  of  social  media.  Simply  approaching  the  favorite  and  like  features  on  Twitter  as  examples  of  techni- cal  affordances  will  not  do.  While  features  clearly  afford  actions,  only  looking  at  what  features allow users to do would quickly miss  out  on  the  multifarious  meanings  and  com- municative  affordances  these  buttons  entail.  Although  identical  actions,  taking  into  account  what  users  say,  believe and expect these features to be able to  accomplish varies greatly.  technically  affording   followed,  particularly  around   Similar  points  could  be  made  when  con- sidering  the  recent  introduction  of Twitter’s  ‘algorithmic  timeline’  and  the  reactions  that  the  RIPTwitter  trending  topic.  Here,  assessing  affordances  in  terms  of  whether  the Twitter  feed is being used in the ways envisioned by  designers in the vein of Norman would fail to  acknowledge ‘the role of the Twitter hashtag  as a means of coordinating a distributed dis- cussion among large numbers of users’ and to  explain the emergence of such ‘hashtag pub- lics’  Bruns and Burgess, 2015: 14 . What a  concept  like  imagined  affordances  usefully  points  to  is  that  we  also  need  to  consider  the  ways  in  which  the  technology  is  imag- ined  by  its  users   Nagy  and  Neff,  2015:  4 .  As Bucher  2016  has shown in her research  on  how  Facebook’s  algorithms  are  imag- ined,  people’s  expectations  and  perceptions  of technology may affect behaviour as much  as its material properties may do. Similarly,  the RIPTwitter reveals how multiple imag- inings exist around what an algorithm is for,  and what the prospects of an algorithmically  curated timeline would do to the possibilities  and constraints of Twitter.  Rather  than  introduce  yet  another  con- cept  of  affordance,  our  aim  in  the  remain- ing  part  of  this  chapter  is  to  contribute  one  way of approaching the empirical analysis of  affordances  in  social  media  by  being  sensi- tive to platform specificities. This specificity  entails  not  merely  looking  at  features  that  manifest  on  a  graphical  user  interface,  but  considers  how  the  affordances  of  platforms  are relational and multi-layered.  Expanding the Notion of the User  Taking  the  specificity  of  platforms  into  account requires extending our notion of the  ‘user’  as  platforms  cater  to  different  users,  actors or stakeholders. We argue for moving  beyond  the  end-user-centred   e.g.,  Gaver,  1991:  97;  Gibson,  2015   and  designer-  centred  e.g., Norman, 1990  approaches that    246  have  figured  prominently  within  affordance  theory.  In  the  literature,  the  term  ‘user’  is  often  used  synonymously  with  the  human  end-user, the person for whom the website or  app  was  originally  designed.  However,  advertisers,  developers  and  researchers  are  platform  users  in  their  own  right  too.  Arguably, Twitter affords different things to  an end-user than to a developer, advertiser or  researcher.  These  different  user  types  are  predefined  by  Twitter,  by  addressing  them  via  distinct  interfaces,  such  as  the  end-user  interfaces, including the website and Twitter  apps,  the  Twitter  APIs  for  developers  and  researchers,  and  the  Advertising  API  for  advertisers.  In  predefining  these  users,  they  could be considered the intended or designed- for  user  types.  While  end-users  typically  stress  social  affordances  associated  with  certain  features  available  on  the  graphical  user  interface  of  Twitter,  most  developers  would  probably  stress  the  importance  of  another  interface  altogether.  communicative  or   the   For  developers,  the  action  possibilities  of  Twitter  are  primarily  related  to  its APIs,  which affords them to build applications on  top  of  the  platform   Bucher,  2013 .  APIs  afford  developers,  but  also  researchers,14  advertisers and other users, access to and the  possibility to re-use the data and functional- ity  of  platforms.  Using  the  Twitter  APIs,15  a  number  of  third-party  services  have  been  built  on  top  of  Twitter,  including  services  like  Favrd  and  Favstar,  which  have  utilized  Twitter’s  favorite  feature.  These  services  have  made  the  act  of  favoriting  public  by  aggregating  favorite  tweets,  and  by  show- ing  users  who  had  favorited  their  tweets   MacManus, 2009 . In doing so, Favrd turned  the  favorite  from  a  personal  bookmarking  mechanism into a public popularity measure   MacManus, 2009 . Favstar further enhanced  the  public  nature  of  favorites  by  offering  a  social  network  around  favorites  through  leader  boards  and  other  features   Paßmann  et  al.,  2014 .  In  this  way,  developers  –  in  conjunction  with  end-users  and  their  use   practices – have played an important role in  shaping the action possibilities of the favorite  button  by  envisioning  new  use  case  scenar- ios. The creation of third-party services built  on top of the favorite feature, such as Favstar,  shows how developers may conceive of new  action possibilities which in their turn enable  novel communicational dynamics outside the  Twitter  platform.  It  emphasizes  the  speci- ficity  of  Twitter,  as  a  platform  which  has  a  history of being fairly ‘open’ for third-party  development, as an environment in which the  generative potentials of end-users and devel- opers  should  be  taken  into  account  when  examining the platform’s affordances.  In light of stalled user growth at Twitter, the  change from favorites to likes should not just  be seen as an attempt at catering to end-users’  needs  and  practices   i.e.,  ‘you’ve  embraced  hearts’, as Twitter’s spokesperson has said ,  but  also  as  an  integrated  approach  to  the  standardization of expressions that enables or  operates according to a dual logic of decen- tralization  and  recentralization  that  extends  the  ‘environment’  beyond  the  confines  of  the  platform   Helmond,  2015 .  The  Twitter  APIs and their underlying logic of connectiv- ity have enabled an ecosystem of third-party  apps  and  services,  weaving Twitter  into  the  larger  social  media  ecosystem   Van  Dijck,  2013 .16  This  includes  creating  connections  between  Twitter  and  other  Twitter-owned  services such as Periscope and Vine, as well  as other social media platforms, e.g., through  the  practice  of  automatically  cross-posting  content  to  Facebook  or  LinkedIn,  thereby  extending  Twitter’s  functionalities  into  the  larger social media ecosystem. Furthermore,  the change from favorite into like can be seen  as a form of standardizing modes of engage- ment across various social media platforms,  or  as  technology  reporter  Newton   2015   notes: ‘likes and hearts have become a kind  of universal currency of the social web, from  Facebook to Tumblr to Instagram’.  The like, as a ‘universal currency’ in social  media,  is  particularly  important  to  advertis- ers,  for  whom  the  Twitter  platform  affords    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   247  the  promotion  of  content  by  targeting  end- users  and  the  measurement  of  engagement.  While  the  like  feature  has  certain  com- municative  affordances,  such  as  signalling  support  or  sharing  information  with  friends   Brandtzaeg  and  Haugstveit,  2014;  Guy  et  al.,  2016 ,  for  advertisers  the  feature  and  the actions it enables facilitates possibilities  to tailor and personalize ads, and to measure  engagement.  Twitter’s  Ads  API17  connects  Twitter, Twitter Official Partners18 and adver- tisers to target end-users based on who they  follow,  information  about  the  device  they  are  using,  such  as  IP  address  and  installed  apps,  and  interactions  with  tweets,  includ- ing  retweeting,  replying  and  liking  among  other signals.19 These activities are also used  to  predict  the  engagement  rate  for  an  ad  in  order  to  determine  its  relevancy  for  a  user,  and subsequently the ad’s price.20 Moreover,  Twitter  collects  data  from  people  engaging  within the wider ‘Twitter ecosystem’  Twitter  Help Center, n.d. , by tracking end-users and  non-Twitter  users  across  the  web  via  plat- form  functionality  such  as  Twitter  buttons  on  external  websites  and  apps   cf.  Gerlitz  and  Helmond,  2013 . This  is  what  Heyman   2016: 143  calls the ‘hidden affordances’  as  defined by Gaver  of social media platforms  since users do not perceive the action possi- bility of placing cookies to track users across  the web.  Platform Users and their  Interfaces  If the users of platforms are diverse and mul- tiple, so are their points of contact. Users can  form  relations  with  the  platform  through  multiple interfaces  or surfaces in Hookway’s  notion ,  such  as  the  various APIs  that  have  been discussed above. However, these are not  isolated or separate points of contact between  the  Twitter  platform  and  its  different  users.  Rather, together they constitute the platform  environment as a whole and enable relations  between all users inside the platform, as well   as relations with users outside the platform’s  boundaries.  Similar  to  the  ways  in  which  Gibson foregrounds the relationality between  an animal and the environment in his concep- tualization of affordance, Hookway’s notion  of interface privileges the formation of a rela- tion,  and  how  that  relation  in  turn  may  become productive of certain actions. Social  media platforms and their underlying logic of  ‘connectivity’  Van Dijck, 2013  also require  a view on affordances that moves beyond the  boundaries  of  the  platform  and  takes  the  larger  environment  in  which  the  platform  operates into account. The notion of connec- tivity,  José  Van  Dijck  and  Thomas  Poell  contend,  refers  to  ‘the  socio-technical  affordance  of  networked  platforms  to  con- nect  content  to  user  activities  and  advertis- ers’   2013:  8 .  In  the  case  of  the  Twitter  platform and its users, the different APIs may  provide some clues as to how different rela- tionships  come  into  being  and  the  kinds  of  actions  that  are  enabled.  Importantly,  these  APIs also transform the domain and practices  of advertising, research and marketing them- selves  insofar  as  they  are  now  being  chan- nelled through Twitter. As our brief discussion  of  interfaces  has  shown,  platforms  address  users  differently  and  the  possibilities  for  action  are  therefore  relative  to  users   see  Gibson,  2015;  Hutchby,  2001a .  The  move  from favorite to likes, we want to suggest, is  symptomatic  of  this  drive  towards  connect- ing  various  users  together  by  standardizing  the metric of endorsement across all Twitter  products and places connected to those prod- ucts  such as external websites or apps .  The Adaptability of Platform  Surfaces  In  addition  to  expanding  the  notion  of  the  user  and  looking  at  different  interfaces,  a  third important aspect of a platform-sensitive  approach is to consider the specificity of the  digital  environment  more  explicitly.  What  distinguishes  social  media  platforms  from    248  Gibson’s natural environment is the increas- ingly dynamic and malleable nature of these  platforms. Following Gibson, platforms pre- sent themselves relative to their inhabitants,  but contra Gibson, for whom the surfaces of  the natural environment do not change as the  needs of the observer changes, social media  platforms adapt their surfaces to their users.  These  surfaces  are  optimized  for  web  or  mobile use and they can be adapted through  platform  settings  and  personalization  fea- tures, which create personalized surfaces for  end-users. In addition, the common practice  of A B testing, a technique to test the effec- tiveness  of  new  features,  functionalities  or  algorithmic recommendations with different  groups  of  end-users  of  the  platform,  gener- ates  multiple  platform  surfaces.  Platform  surfaces  are  relative  because  they,  in  many  cases, are personalized for each end-user and  because  platforms  create  and  present  multi- ple  interfaces   as  discussed  in  the  previous  section   that  enable  and  constrain  users’  action possibilities.  A key question that we think social media  researchers  should  be  asking  in  terms  of  affordance  theory  is  how  the  environment  they  are  studying  differs  from  the  kind  of  environment  studied  by  Gibson  and  other  affordance  theorists.  When  Gibson  wrote  about  what  the  environment  affords  the  animal,  he  was  primarily  thinking  of  its  terrestrial  features  such  as  water  margins,  rocks and cliffs  2015: 31–36 . A cliff offers  certain  things  because  of  what  it  is,  not  because of the wishes bestowed upon it by  an  interlocutor   Gibson,  2015:  130 .  With  the  computational  systems  driving  social  media  platforms,  the  environment  takes  on  a different character that we think needs to  be  attended  to.  More  specifically,  it  seems  that  an  algorithmically  organized  environ- ment  challenges  the  invariant  nature  of  affordances in important ways. As noted by  Nagy  and  Neff,  technologies  are  increas- ingly  ‘adaptive,  learning,  responsive,  and  changing  along  with  the  users  they  share  an  environment  with’   2015:  5 .  While   Facebook  has  often  been  the  exemplary  case  in  terms  of  the  adaptable  and  malle- able nature of platforms, the move towards  non-linear  news  feeds  on  platforms  such  as Twitter and Instagram21 suggests a more  general tendency towards a personalized fur- nishing  to use Gibson’s words  of the social  media  environment.  While  the  term  ‘algo- rithmic timeline’ may be somewhat of a mis- nomer for a feed that technically speaking is  already algorithmic in the sense that tweets  are  arranged  in  a  reverse-chronological  manner by an algorithm, the extent to which  algorithms  are  used  to  organize  feeds  rela- tive to users and their activities is new. This  means that the digital environment does not  merely  offer  something  to  its  users,  users’  needs and individual likings and behaviours  increasingly  play  a  generative  role  in  pro- ducing those very offerings in the first place.   Non human Agency Affording  Things to Technology  The  feedback-loops  and  generative  role  of  users  in  shaping  the  algorithmically  entan- gled  social  media  environment  brings  us  to  our final point we want to make in terms of  what  we  mean  by  a  platform-sensitive  approach  to  affordances.  While  affordance  theory has mainly put emphasis on the ques- tion  of  what  technology  affords  users,  the  socio-technical  nature  of  social  media  plat- forms also begs the reverse question of what  users  afford  to  platforms?  In  the  age  of  so- called  big  data  fuelled  by  expansive  data  points and machine learning algorithms that  respond  to  user  input  in  an  adaptive  way,  users serve quite literally as the ‘action pos- sibilities’  of  platforms.  For  example,  Facebook uses machine learning for ranking  search results, serving the most relevant ads,  identifying  faces,  and  predicting  which  memories people would like to view  Applied  Machine  Learning,  n.d. .  The  platform  fea- ture ‘On This Day’ employs a machine learn- ing  model  which  learns  in  real  time  and    the aFFordanCes oF soCial Media PlatForMs   249  continuously from people about which mem- ories  they  would  like  to  see  in  their  News  Feeds  Aziz and Paluri, 2016 . In these cases,  the  question  of  who  affords  what  and  to  whom seems increasingly more complex.  In  order  to  do  the  relational  view  on  affordances  full  justice,  we  need  to  con- sider the multi-directionality of agency and  connectivity at play. More specifically, this  means  looking  at  what  users  afford  to  the  environment, where users are understood in  the expanded and typified ways explicated  above. We have not been able to account for  all  the  different  forms  of  users  above   nor  do we believe such an exhaustive account is  even possible , but want to stress that users are  not  confined  to  humans  such  as  end-users  and developers, but to nonhumans alike. As  actors in their own right, algorithms can be  considered ‘hidden affordances’ in Gaver’s  sense as their action possibilities shape our  social relations and the content we see with- out being directly perceivable as such  Nagy  and Neff, 2015: 3 . Moreover, it’s not only  a question of what these algorithms afford  to  end-users,  but  also  what  they  afford  to  the platform. In sorting and ranking content  by displaying ‘the best Tweets first’ based  on ‘accounts you interact with most, Tweets  you engage with, and much more’ in order  to ‘catch up on the best Tweets from people  you  follow’   About  your  Twitter  timeline,  n.d. ,  algorithms  are  geared  towards  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  participation  and engagement. In light of Twitter’s stalled  user growth, the move towards an algorith- mically  sorted  timeline  can  be  interpreted  as  a  corporate  attempt  at  becoming  more  relevant,  and  therefore  more  engaging  for  its users.  As  we  see  it,  then,  a  platform-sensitive  approach requires a socio-technical sensibil- ity towards the distributed agency of humans  and  nonhumans  at  play.  As  Gibson  him- self pointed out, affordance ‘cuts across the  dichotomy  of  subjective–objective’   2015:  121 . Rather than thinking of the affordances  of  social  media  platform  as  one-way   relationships  whereby  either  the  technology  affords  something  to  users  or,  as  we  might  have  suggested  in  this  section,  users  afford  things  to  technology,  the  presence  of  algo- rithms  in  particular  suggests  that  such  uni- directionality does not hold. By clicking and  liking  end-users  fuel  the  algorithms,  which  in  their  turn  generate  the  information  flows  fed  back  to  end-users.  Moreover,  the  clicks  and likes fuel the interest and engagement of  developers, researchers and advertisers, who  help to keep the platforms in business.  Furthermore,  the  specific  affordances  of  Twitter  as  an  extendable  platform,  which  includes  Twitter’s  extension  into  the  web  and the app space through the Twitter button  and Sign in with Twitter login feature, feeds  data such as likes generated in external web- sites and third-party apps back into the plat- form. When Twitter  end-users  are  browsing  websites  outside Twitter  with Twitter  Login  or a Twitter button, they are still part of the  ‘Twitter ecosystem’.22 Data about these web- site  and  app  visits  in  the Twitter  ecosystem  flows  back  into  the  Twitter  platform  and  is  used  to  profile  users  based  on  the  websites  they  have  visited  to  suggest  new  people  to  follow who visit similar webpages. In other  words, we might see how the activities of a  diverse  set  of  users,  both  inside  as  well  as  outside  the  platform’s  boundaries,  afford  back  to  the  platform.  Thus,  a  platform-sen- sitive  approach  to  affordances  should  con- sider how a platform’s infrastructure extends  its  affordances  beyond  its  own  environment  and  how  they  may  be  integrated  in  other  platforms and services as well as how these  activities afford back to the platform and its  multiple users.  conclusion  The notion of a platform-sensitive framework  is meant to emphasize the specificity of plat- forms  as  socio-technological  environments  that draw different users together and which    250  orchestrate  the  relations  between  different  platform users. Such a perspective enables us  to  see  how  platforms  may  afford  different  things  to  various  types  of  users,  including  end-users,  developers  and  advertisers;  and  considers  how  they  are  connected  through  various  possibilities  for  action.  As  demon- strated in our case study on two recent plat- form changes, the like provides distinct action  possibilities for end-users  e.g., liking a tweet   and  to  advertisers   e.g.,  measuring  engage- ment , enabling us to comprehend affordances  vis-à-vis the economic underpinnings of plat- forms. In addition, we have emphasized how  affordances  extend  across  the  boundaries  of  platforms  and  how  both  human  and  nonhu- man users importantly afford something back  to the platform. In the case of Twitter’s new  algorithmic  timeline,  it  does  not  only  afford  end-users to receive relevant content first, but  this  relevance  is  in  its  turn  established  by  those  same  end-users  liking,  replying  and  retweeting  content,  thereby  affording  things  back to the algorithm and the platform. Thus,  employing the concept of affordance to study  social  media  requires  explicating  how  the  concept  is  used  and  considering  the  work  it  may  do  analytically.  Furthermore,  for  the  study  of  social  media  platforms,  as  we  have  argued  throughout  this  chapter,  we  should  take the specificity of platforms into account,  which requires us to revisit earlier conceptual- izations of affordance and to analyse critically  how  they  may  be  employed  or  translated  to  platform environments.

Their  founders  were  inspired  by  or  hoping  to  capitalize  on  the freedom it promised, while also hoping to  provide  spaces  for  the  web’s  best  and  most  social  aspects.  But  as  these  platforms  grew,  that chaos and contention found its way back  onto them – for obvious reasons: if I want to  say  something,  whether  inspiring  or  repre- hensible,  I  want  to  say  it  where  someone,  maybe even everyone, might hear me. Today,  we  by  and  large  speak  on  platforms  when  we’re  online.  Social  media  platforms  afford  their  users  new  opportunities  to  speak  and  interact with a wider range of people, organ- izing  them  into  networked  publics   boyd,  2011; Varnelis, 2008 . Though the benefits of  this may seem obvious, even seem utopian at  times, the perils are also painfully apparent,  more  so  every  day:  the  pornographic,  the  obscene, the violent, the abusive, the illegal,  and the hateful.  While  scholars  have  long  discussed  the  legal  and  political  dynamics  of  speech   online, much of that discussion preceded the  dramatic  move  of  so  much  of  that  speech  onto  social  media  platforms   Balkin,  2004;  Godwin, 2003; Lessig, 1999; Litman, 1999 .  By platforms, I mean: sites and services that  host,  organize,  and  circulate  users’  shared  content  or  social  exchanges  for  them;  with- out  having  produced  or  commissioned  [the  majority  of]  that  content;  beneath  that  cir- culation,  an  infrastructure  for  processing  that  data   content,  traces,  patterns  of  social  relations  for customer service and for profit.  This  includes  Facebook,  YouTube,  Twitter,  Tumblr,  Pinterest,  Google+,  Instagram,  and  Snapchat… but also Google Search and Bing,  Apple App Store and Google Play, Medium  and  Blogger,  Foursquare  and  Nextdoor,  Tinder  and  Grindr,  Etsy  and  Kickstarter,  Whisper and Yik Yak. With this growing and  increasingly  powerful  set  of  digital  inter- mediaries,  we  have  to  revisit  difficult  ques- tions  about  how  they  structure  the  speech  and social activity they host, and what rights  and  responsibilities  should  accompany  that     regulation oF and by PlatForMs  255   DeNardis  &  Hackl,  2015;  Gillespie,  2015;  Grimmelman,  2015;  MacKinnon  et  al.,   2014;  Obar  &  Wildman,  2015;  van  Dijck,  2013; Wagner, 2013 .  Traditional private information providers –  publishers,  broadcasters,  resellers,  telecom- munications – already have established legal  obligations for the speech they facilitate, in the  USA  and  elsewhere   Baker,  2001;  Benkler,  1998;  Braman,  2004;  Entman  &  Wildman,  1992;  Freedman,  2008;  Hendershot,  1999;  Horwitz, 1991a, 1991b; Streeter, 1996 . But  traditional  communication  policies  have  proven difficult to apply, honor, and enforce  online  Bar & Sandvig, 2008; Braman, 2014;  Castronova,  2015;  Johnson  &  Post,  1996;  Lessig, 1999; Tushnet, 2008 . Even Internet- centric  solutions  formulated  in  an  earlier  moment, such as limited liability, safe harbor,  and  takedown  measures  for  search  engine  and  Internet  Service  Providers   ISPs ,  are  arguably an ill fit for social media platforms   MacKinnon  et  al.,  2014 . Today,  platforms  face  more  vocal  calls,  from  policymakers,  from users, from foreign governments, from  activists, and from the press, to both permit  contentious speech and to curate it.  This essay begins with the governance of  platforms:  the  laws  and  policies  that  have  emerged  in  the  past  decade  specifying  their  liabilities  or lack thereof  for the user con- tent and activity they host. In the USA, these  regulations  are  limited  by  a  fundamental  reluctance  to  constraint  speech,  whereas  internationally,  these  same  platforms  face  a  wider array of restrictions. It will then con- sider  the  governance  by  platforms.  This  is  related to the first, but is not the same. Social  media  platforms  have  increasingly  taken  on  the responsibility of curating the content and  policing the activity of their users: not simply  to meet legal requirements, or to avoid hav- ing  additional  policies  imposed,  but  also  to  avoid  losing  offended  or  harassed  users,  to  placate  advertisers  eager  to  associate  their  brands with a healthy online community, to  protect  their  corporate  image,  and  to  honor  their  own  personal  and  institutional  ethics.   Some of these interventions are welcomed by  users,  while  others  have  been  more  conten- tious. The regulatory framework we impose  on  platforms,  and  the  ways  in  which  the  major platforms enact those obligations and  impose their own on their users, are settling  in as the way public speech online is and will  be privately governed.  regulaTion of plaTforms  Platforms vary, in ways that matter both for  the influence they can assert over users and  for how they should be governed. It is decep- tively easy in public debates, and in scholar- ship, to simply point accusingly at Facebook  or  Twitter  and  move  on,  without  acknowl- edging  the  variety  of  purpose,  scope,  mem- bership,  economics,  and  design  across  the  array  of  sites  and  services  that  call  them- selves platforms. In fact, ‘platform’ is a slip- pery term, in part because there may be little  that unites different sites as a category, and in  part because it gets deployed strategically, by  stakeholders  and  critics  alike   Gillespie,  2010 . As  shorthand,  it  too  easily  equates  a  site with the company that offers it, implies  that  social  media  companies  act  with  one  mind,  and  downplay  the  people  involved.  Platforms  are  socio-technical  assemblages  and complex institutions; they’re not even all  commercial,  and  the  commercial  ones  are  commercial  in  different  ways.  At  the  same  time, ‘platform’ is a widely used term by the  companies themselves. And many discourses  of responsibility and liability  legal and oth- erwise   conceive  of  institutions  as  singular  entities, and for good reason.  In the Middle  In  the  language  of  US  information  policy,  ‘platform’  as  a  term  has  not  enjoyed  much  traction.  Most  of  the  policies  that  currently  apply to social media platforms were crafted    256  before their emergence, to address a broader  category  of  online  services  and  access  pro- viders.  The  preferred  term  of  art,  ‘online  intermediaries,’  which  replaced  an  earlier  and now archaic term, ‘interactive computing  services,’  is  broader.  The  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development   OECD   definition  helps  highlight  what’s  common to all these terms: ‘Internet interme- diaries  bring  together  or  facilitate  transac- tions  between  third  parties  on  the  Internet.  They give access to, host, transmit and index  content, products and services originated by  third  parties  on  the  Internet  or  provide  Internet-based  services  to  third  parties’   OECD, 2010 . The definition highlights two  important  aspects:   1   online  intermediaries  come  between  and  facilitate  the  connection  of others, and  2  the content they transmit is  produced by others.  Contemporary  social  media  platforms  fit  this  category,  but  they  also  complicate  it.  They are not ‘content producers’  though in  practice they do produce lots of ancillary con- tent along the way ; rather, they host, store,  organize,  and  circulate  the  content  of  oth- ers. While the hosting provided by platforms  is  more  involved  than  that  of  ISPs,  and  the  organizing of content provided by platforms  is more involved than that of search engines,  these differences are of degree more than of  kind, given that all network services store and  circulate  content  as  part  of  their  service,  at  least temporarily or incidentally.  By  calling  them  intermediaries,  let’s  rec- ognize that social media platforms are funda- mentally in the middle – that is, they mediate  between users who produce content and users  who might want it. This makes them similar  to not only search engines and ISPs, but also  traditional media. They too face a regulatory  framework  designed  to  oversee  how  they  mediate  between  producers  and  audiences,  between speakers and listeners.  Social media platforms are not only in the  middle between user and user, and user and  public, but between citizens and law enforce- ment,  policymakers,  and  regulators  charged   with governing their behavior. Online, illicit  activity can be difficult to pinpoint and dif- ficult to police: users can enjoy the anonym- ity provided by some sites, and the obscurity  provided by encryption and transient Internet  connections;  illicit  content  moves  easily  across regional jurisdictions and has oblique  or cumulative effects. Since platforms gather  people  and  collect  traces  of  their  activity,  they  present  a  compelling  opportunity  to  policymakers to govern users through them.  The  regulation  of  platforms  is  marked  by  and struggles with this middle-ness, and the  thorny questions of convenience and respon- sibility that come with it.1  Public  and  policy  concerns  around  illicit  content,  at  first  largely  focused  on  sexu- ally explicit and graphically violent images,  have  expanded  in  recent  years  to  include  additional  categories  like  hate  speech,  self- harm,  and  extremism;  and  to  deal  with  the  enormous problem of user behavior targeting  other  users,  including  misogynistic,  racist,  and  homophobic  attacks,  trolling,  harass- ment,  and  threats  of  violence.  Questions  about the responsibility of platforms are also  expanding as the range of platforms expand:  to  social  platforms  that  circulate  goods   auction sites like eBay, exchange sites like  Craigslist,  and  e-commerce  platforms  like  Etsy ,  that  circulate  money  or  investment   Kiva, Venmo , that circulate labor  Amazon  Mechanical Turk, Uber, Taskrabbit , or that  trade  access  to  physical  services   AirBnB .  Each  of  these  intersects  with  other  regula- tory frameworks, but each also includes fun- damental  questions  about  whether  and  how  platforms  should  be  responsible  for  their   independent,  amateur,  non-salaried   users’  speech and actions.  The Myth of the Impartial  Platform  Social  media  platforms  have  long  framed  themselves as open, impartial, and noninter- ventionist  –  in  part  because  their  founders    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  257  fundamentally believe it to be so, and in part  to avoid liability and regulation. This funda- mental mystification of the role of platforms  began  when  platforms  did:  from  the  start  they have often characterized themselves as  open to all comers; in their promotional dis- course  they  often  suggest  that  they  merely  facilitate  public  expression,  that  they  are  impartial and hands-off hosts, with an ‘infor- mation will be free’ ethos, and that being so  is  central  to  their  mission   Gillespie,  2010;  Vaidhyanathan, 2011 . Though users seem to  be  recognizing  that  platforms  intervene  in  myriad  ways  and  are  growing  increasingly  concerned  about  it,  platforms  continue  to  perform their impartiality.  This is odd, considering that, from a dif- ferent  view,  everything  on  a  platform  is  designed  and  orchestrated.  While  social  activity  would  exist  without  Facebook  or  Twitter,  the  kind  of  social  activities  that  occur there depends powerfully on the space  and  structure  they  provide   Baym  &  boyd,  2012; Bruns and Burgess, 2015; Couldry &  van Dijck, 2015; Gerlitz & Helmond, 2013;  Langlois, 2013; Sandvig, 2015; Shepherd &  Landry,  2013;  van  Dijck,  2013; Weltevrede  et  al.,  2014 .  Platforms  don’t  just  mediate  public  discourse,  they  constitute  it.  They  are  designed  to  invite  and  shape  participa- tion,  toward  particular  ends.  This  includes  what  kind  of  participation  they  invite  and  encourage; what gets displayed first or most  prominently;  how  navigation  tools  direct  the  movement  of  users  and  content;  how  revenue  models  impose  price  mechanisms;  and  how  they  organize  information  through  algorithmic sorting, privileging some content  over others, in opaque ways. And it includes  what is not permitted, and how and why that  prohibition  is  enforced   Gillespie,  2015;  Grimmelmann, 2015 .  The Rise of Safe Harbor  In the mid-1990s, policymakers in the USA  and  of   elsewhere   became   aware   growing  concerns  about  the  proliferation  of  illicit content on the web, especially pornog- raphy  and  piracy.2  In  such  cases,  it  proved  difficult to directly pursue online ‘publishers’  for their illegal or illicit behavior, particularly  when those publishers were individuals, usu- ally  amateurs,  sometimes  anonymous,  and  hard to locate and identify. Because of this,  some lawsuits brought in the USA for defa- mation,  publication  of  private  documents,  and  the  distribution  of  hate  speech,  began  targeting  not  the  individual  user  but  the  Internet  service  provider  disseminating  the  content  Ardia, 2010; Kreimer, 2006; Mann  & Belzley, 2005 .  In the United States, Congress crafted its  first  legislative  response  to  some  of  these  issues,  the  Communication  Decency  Act   CDA , as part of a massive telecommunica- tions bill. Passed in 1996, the CDA made it a  criminal act to display or distribute ‘obscene  or  indecent’  material  to  minors.   It  also  imposed  similar  penalties  for  harassing  or  threatening  someone  online.   The  law  was  ruled unconstitutional3 by the Supreme Court  only a year later. However, parts of the law  survived, including the defenses it provided  for ‘interactive computer service providers’ –  safe harbors against any liability for harmful  material  their  users  might  provide.  Because  these  safe  harbors  were  not  at  issue  in  the  Supreme Court decision, they have remained  a part of US telecommunication law, known  as Section 230.  The Section 230 safe harbor has two parts   Mueller, 2015 . The first assures that inter- mediaries cannot be held liable for the speech  of  their  users,  since  they  merely  provide  access  to  the  Internet  or  other  network  ser- vices;  they  will  not  be  considered  ‘publish- ers’ of their users’ content, in the legal sense.  The implication was that, like the telephone  company, intermediaries do not need to police  what their users say and do. The second, less  familiar part adds a twist: if an intermediary  does decide to police what their users say or  do,  it  does  not  lose  its  safe  harbor  protec- tion by doing so. In other words, choosing to    258  delete some content does not suddenly make  them  ‘publishers,’  nor  does  it  require  them  to meet some standard of effective policing.  This second half was crafted so that the safe  harbor  would  not  create  legal  jeopardy  for  intermediaries that chose to moderate in good  faith,  by  making  them  no  more  liable  for  it  than if they had simply turned a blind eye.  Section  230  extends  a  legislative  distinc- tion common to US telecommunication law,  between publishers who produce information   and therefore can be held liable for it  and  distributors that merely circulate the informa- tion of others  and should not  – commonly  known  as  the  ‘content conduit’  distinction.  Since  ISPs  offered  ‘access’  to  the  Internet,  and did not produce the content they help cir- culate, the law prioritizes the free movement  of information, and limited their liability for  the  content  users  circulated  through  them.4  As  with  telephone  systems,  holding  a  pro- vider  liable  for  what  users  say  or  do  might  encourage  that  provider  to  monitor  users  proactively  and  shut  down  anything  that  looked risky. This would be not only practi- cally impossible and financially unbearable,5  but  also  politically  undesirable.  Legislators  and technologists feared that this might also  discourage online innovation, as new ISPs or  interactive computer services might not dare  enter the market if the immediate legal risks  were  too  costly   Center  for  Democracy  and  Technology  CDT , 2010 .  Outside  the  USA,  few  nations  offer  the  robust  safe  harbor  provided  in  Section  230.  MacKinnon et al.  2014: 42  dub the American  approach ‘broad immunity,’ the most lenient of  three types of intermediary liability regimes they  identify. Most of the European Union nations,  as  well  as  Russia  and  most  South American  nations, offer intermediaries ‘conditional liabil- ity,’ which is more akin to the American rules  for copyright. Platforms are not liable for what  their  users  post  or  distribute,  as  long  as  they  have no ‘actual knowledge’ of, and did not pro- duce or initiate the illegal or illicit material, and  they must respond to requests from the state or  the courts to remove illicit third-party content.   China and many of the nations in the Middle  East impose ‘strict liability’  MacKinnon et al.,  2014:  40 ,  requiring  Internet  intermediaries  to  prevent  the  circulation  of  illicit  or  unlaw- ful  content. This  generally  means  proactively  removing or censoring, often in direct coopera- tion with the government. Without a regulatory  bulwark against state intervention, these private  actors are much more beholden to government  demands,  and  in  some  cases  even  rules  that  prohibit political speech. Finally, some nations,  for  example  in  sub-Saharan Africa,  have  not  instituted laws articulating the responsibilities  of Internet intermediaries in any form, leaving  intermediaries there uncertain about what they  might or might not be liable for  MacKinnon   et al., 2014: 52 .  But  while  it  is  the  most  generous,  even  American  safe  harbor  for  intermediaries  embodies conflicting views of online service  providers   OSPs .  As  Mueller   2015:  805   writes, Section 230  was  intended  both  to  immunize  OSPs  who  did  nothing to restrict or censor their users’ communi- cations,  and  to  immunize  OSPs  who  took  some  effort to discourage or restrict online pornography  and  other  forms  of  undesirable  content.  Intermediaries  who  did  nothing  were  immunized  in  order  to  promote  freedom  of  expression  and  diversity  online;  intermediaries  who  were  more  active  in  managing  user-generated  content  were  immunized  in  order  to  enhance  their  ability  to  delete or otherwise monitor ‘bad’ content.  These  competing  impulses,  between  allow- ing intermediaries to stay out of the way and  encouraging them to police their users, con- tinue  to  shape  the  way  we  think  about  the  role and responsibility of Internet intermedi- aries,  and  has  extended  to  how  we  regulate  social media platforms.  The Pressures on Safe Harbor  From a legal standpoint, broad and conditional  safe harbors are profoundly advantageous for  Internet  intermediaries.  Notice-and-takedown  requirements  generate  real  challenges  for    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  259  platforms, and are prone to abuse, but are far  preferable for platforms than being held liable  for what their users post  Urban et al., 2016 .  As Tushnet  2008: 1002  notes, ‘Current law  often  allows  Internet  intermediaries  to  have  their  free  speech  and  everyone  else’s  too.’  However,  while  safe  harbor  provisions  have  held  up  for  two  decades,  three  distinct  chal- lenges are revealing the limitations of the safe  harbor provision, and in some cases are fueling  calls for its reconsideration.  First  and  perhaps  most  obviously,  most  of these laws were not designed with social  media  platforms  in  mind.  When  Section  230  was  being  crafted,  few  such  platforms  existed.  US  lawmakers  were  addressing  a  web largely populated by ISPs and amateur  web  ‘publishers’  –  amateurs  posting  home  pages,  companies  designing  websites,  and  online  communities  having  discussions.  Besides  ISPs  who  simply  provided  access  to  the  network,  the  only  intermediaries  at  the  time  were  ISPs  that  doubled  as  content  ‘portals,’ like AOL and Prodigy; the earliest  search engines like Altavista and Yahoo; and  operators  of  bulletin  board  systems   BBS ,  chatrooms, and newsgroups. The law predates  not just Facebook, but MySpace, Friendster,  and Livejournal; not just YouTube, but Veoh  and Metacafe; not just Soundcloud, but Last. fm and Lala, and Napster and its peer-to-peer  brethren;  even  Google.  Blogging  was  in  its  infancy,  well  before  the  invention  of  large- scale blog hosting services like Blogspot and  Wordpress; eBay, Craigslist, and Match.com  were less than a year old; and the ability to  comment  on  a  web  page  had  not  yet  been  modularized into a plugin.  Although they were not anticipated by the  law,  social  media  platforms  have  generally  claimed  that  they  enjoy  its  safe  harbor.  But  many of the assumptions that animated inter- mediary  liability   particularly  the  questions  of  whether  the  intermediary  has  knowledge  of illicit content, could conceivably intervene  in  its  circulation,  and  benefits  financially  from  it   are  tested  by  contemporary  social  media  platforms.  US  regulatory  traditions,   such as protecting ‘conduits’ from liability so  they are not encouraged to monitor or censor  the content traveling through them, are an ill  fit for YouTube’s ContentID  which can auto- matically identify copyrighted music in user- submitted  videos   or  Facebook’s  NewsFeed  algorithm   which  constructs  a  curated  feed  from user posts designed to keep users inter- ested  and  attentive  to  advertising   or  the  anonymous attacks possible with Yik Yak.  intermediary   Second,  while   liability  regimes  are  typically  bound  by  nation  or  region,  platforms  largely  are  not.  ISPs  are  almost  exclusively  located  in  the  nation  in  which  regulation  is  imposed  and  enforced,  both in terms of the  physical and legal  loca- tion of the company, its material infrastruc- ture,  and  its  users.  This  is  not  the  case  for  the likes of Twitter, Instagram, or Wikipedia.  Most  of  the  major  social  media  platforms  are,  as  corporate  and  legal  entities,  based  in  the  United  States,  where  they  enjoy  the  broadest safe harbor, but they serve millions  of users living in nations that impose much  stricter liability or have specific requirements  for  responding  to  state  or  court  requests  to  remove content.  Major social media platforms have had to  develop their own policies on how to respond  to  requests  from  foreign  governments  to  remove content. Google famously pulled out  of  China  rather  than  filter  its  search  results  according to Chinese dictates  although there  were  certainly  a  variety  of  motivations  for  the move .6 LinkedIn remained, by honoring  the Chinese government’s policies and seek- ing financial investment from Chinese firms.7  Twitter  removes  tweets  in  response  to  gov- ernment requests, but does so only for users  in that nation rather than removing them from  the entire service, and will indicate what has  been  removed  and  at  whose  behest.8  Many  of  the  major  platforms  publish  data  on  the  number of removal requests they receive, by  country  and  by  category  of  request.  Some  have even included ‘warrant canaries’ in their  policy statements, a sentence stating that no  government  subpoenas  had  been  served  –     260  which  they  would  remove  when  it  was  no  longer true, alerting those in the know that a  subpoena had been served without violating  a gag order.  Because  Western  platforms  have  been  cautious about how they respond to removal  requests  from  foreign  governments,  some  nations  have  threatened  to  block  content  they  deem  illegal  or  offensive.  China  and  the  Islamic  nations  of  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  have  been  most  aggressive  in  this tactic. This typically involves providing  local ISPs with a ‘blacklist’ of pages deemed  criminal  or  otherwise  unacceptable.  This  is  more  complicated,  of  course,  on  massive  platforms  such  as  social  networking  sites  and discussion platforms, where the offend- ing  post  or  video  is  just  one  element  of  a  massive,  complex,  and  constantly  changing  database.  As  Palfrey   2010   observes,  this  can  result  in  ‘overfiltering,’  where  a  nation  will  threaten  to  block  not  a  single YouTube  video  or  Facebook  user,  but  YouTube  or  Facebook in its entirety. What often follows  is a high-stakes game of chicken: platforms  do not relish being entirely blocked from an  entire nation of users; at the same time, doing  so is risky for the government as well, as it  may have costs in terms of public sentiment.  For  countries  with  a  stronger  commitment  to  freedom  of  expression  or  independent  telecommunications,  this  tendency  to  block  legitimate content along with the offensive is  an unpalatable one, but others may justify it  as a bulwark against an unwelcome intrusion  of Western culture and values.  Third, a slow reconsideration of platform  responsibility has been spurred by categories  of content particularly abhorrent to users and  governments.  These  hesitations  are  happen- ing in all corners of the world: even US pol- icy, with the broadest safe harbor, has shifted  in the face of specific concerns.  Most  pressing  has  been,  unsurprisingly,  the  issue  of  terrorism.  Certainly,  terrorist  organizations have grown increasingly savvy  in the use of social media platforms  Archetti,  2015 .9  At  time,  combatting   the  same   terrorism is a compelling justification for the  imposition  of  policies  that  may  have  other  political  aims   MacKinnon,  2012 .  Even  in  the United States, where the ethos of the First  Amendment  typically  provides  information  providers  a  powerful  shield  against  govern- ment  intrusion,  terrorism  can  be  an  effec- tive rhetorical counterargument. As ISIS and  other extremist groups have taken to distrib- uting gruesome beheading videos and glossy  recruitment  propaganda  on  YouTube  and  Twitter,  and  more  quietly  coordinated  with  supporters and looked to radicalize the disaf- fected,  pressure  from  Western  governments  on social media to “crack down” on terrorist  organizations has grown.  In  Europe,  this  has  meant  an  increasing  expectation  that  platforms,  once  informed  of terrorist content, must remove it quickly.  Under  the  UK Terrorism Act  of  2006,  plat- forms  have  only  two  days  to  comply  with  a  takedown  request,  otherwise  they  are  deemed to have ‘endorsed’ the terrorist con- tent.10 Others have called for imposing fines  on  platforms  for  failing  to  remove  terror- ist  materials,  compelling  them  to  cooperate  more readily with police investigating terror- ist incidents, and requiring them to share data  with  counterterrorist  investigators.  Several  governments  in  the  Middle  East  have  insti- tuted  new  anti-terrorism  laws   or  attempted  to  that affect platforms. In Egypt, for exam- ple,  a  law  drafted  in  2014  gave  authorities  much wider latitude to intervene in and sur- veil online communication for suspected ter- rorist activity. Similar laws have been passed  in Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.11And in  the United States, several lawsuits have been  brought,  though  none  have  succeeded  thus  far, against Twitter or Facebook for providing  “material support” to terrorist organizations,  by the families of victims of terrorist attacks. Hate speech and racial discrimination have  also  fueled  debates  about  the  obligations  of  social  media  platforms,  particularly  in  Europe. Germany and France both have laws  prohibiting  the  promotion  of  Nazism,  anti- Semitism, and white supremacy. The French    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  261  law  produced  one  of  the  earliest  online  content  cases,  in  which  Yahoo  was  com- pelled to prevent French users from access- ing  online  auctions  of  Nazi  memorabilia.12  More recently, when anti-Semitic comments  began appearing on Twitter under the hashtag  unbonjuif,  or  ‘a  good  Jew,’  French  courts  pressed  Twitter  to  turn  over  the  user  data  behind  the  offending  tweets   Mackinnon  et al., 2014 . Similar concerns have emerged  in other parts of the world. In Argentina, in  addition to their anti-discrimination law was  considered that would require intermediaries  to monitor and remove comments that were  racist  or  discriminatory,  and  would  even  encourage them to remove the comment fea- tures of their sites entirely.13  Nations  that  do  not  share  the  American  version of freedom of expression have been  more willing to criminalize speech that criti- cizes the government or upsets public order.  Some nations are limiting press freedoms for  bloggers and amateur speech on social media  platforms. Laws that curtail the press online  have  appeared  in  Egypt,  Iran,  Pakistan,  Tunisia,  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates.14  In  other  nations,  including  Kuwait  and  Lebanon,  laws  that  prohibit  the  disruption  of public order have been applied to political  activists.15  Some  countries  prohibit  speech  directly criticizing their leaders, and in some  cases  these  rules  have  been  extended  to  social  media  platforms.  In  2012,  authorities  in Brazil arrested the head of Google Brazil  for refusing to remove YouTube videos that  targeted Brazilian political candidates,16 and  Facebook  now  complies  with  Turkish  law  criminalizing  defamation  of  the  country’s  founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, or the burn- ing of the Turkish flag, by removing any such  content flagged by users.17 Facebook works  with  Pakistan  to  remove  online  blasphemy,  with  Vietnam  to  remove  anti-government  content,  and  with  Thailand  to  remove  criti- cism of the royal family.  Other  countries  have  used  laws  that  exist  purportedly  to  combat  cybercrime,  protect  children,  or  prohibit  terrorist  content,  to   pressure platforms to remove politically con- tentious materials. Russia has been the inno- vator in this regard. In 2009, Russian law held  that website owners are responsible for what  users post in the comments on their site. In  2012, they developed a ‘blacklist’ of sites that  include ‘forbidden information’  illicit drugs,  porn,  suicide ,  requiring  Russian  ISPs  to  block these sites. ISPs were forced to respond  to  requests  not  only  from  the  court  or  state  regulatory  authorities  but  also  from  regular  citizens, including the ‘Media Guard’ youth  group,  which  targeted  gay  teen  forums  and  Ukrainian political organizations.18 In 2014,  the Russian government took a bolder step: a  new dictate would require transnational plat- forms that have Russian users to store those  users’  data  on  servers  located  physically  in  Russia – otherwise, the whole platform would  be  blocked  nationwide.19 The  revelations  of  National  Security  Agency   NSA   surveil- lance by Edward Snowden were the nominal  justification,  but  many  suspected  that  hous- ing  the  data  inside  Russia’s  borders  would  make it easier for the government to access  that  data  and  squelch  political  speech.  As  of  this  writing,  the   mostly  US-based   plat- forms have refused, and Russia has extended  the  deadline  for  compliance.  In  addition,  in  2015 Russia decreed that bloggers with more  than 3,000 page views per day must register  as  media  and  follow  Russian  media  laws.  Though unclear, this seems to include users  with over 3,000 daily visitors on Twitter and  Facebook.20  The United States has by and large stayed  true  to  the  safe  harbor  protections  first  offered  to  online  intermediaries.  But  grow- ing  concerns  about  terrorism  and  extremist  content, harassment and cyber bullying, and  the  circulation  of  non-consensual  pornogra- phy   commonly  known  as  ‘revenge  porn’   have  tested  this  commitment.  A  number  of  platforms  have  developed  specific  policies  prohibiting  revenge  porn,21  modeled  on  the  notice-and-takedown  arrangements  in  copy- right law: platforms are not obligated to pro- actively look for violations, but will respond    262  to requests to remove them. This involves the  kind of adjudicating platforms prefer to avoid:  determining  whether  a  complainant   who  may not even be a user of that platform  is in  fact the subject of the video or photo, whether  the material was posted with or without the  subject’s consent, who owns the imagery and  thus the right to circulate it, and so forth. In  early 2016, the Obama administration urged  US tech companies to develop new strategies  for  identifying  extremist  content,  either  to  remove it or to report it to national security  authorities.22 Around harassment, pressure is  coming from users, particularly women and  racial  minorities,  who  argue  that  the  abuses  have  become  so  unbearable  that  platforms  have an obligation to intervene  Kayyali and  O’Brien, 2015; Matias et al., 2015 .  Together,  these  calls  to  hold  platforms  liable  for  specific  kinds  of  abhorrent  con- tent  or  behavior,  and  the  increasing  chal- lenges  posed  by  governments  seeking  to  use platforms as a way to constrain political  speech  and  activism,  are  undercutting  the  once  sturdy  principle  of  safe  harbor  articu- lated in Section 230 and elsewhere. As these  platforms  multiply  in  form  and  purpose,  become  more  and  more  central  to  how  and  where users encounter each other online, and  involve themselves in the circulation of not  just  words  and  images  but  goods,  money,  services,  and  labor,  intermediary  liability  seems more and more insufficient. Platforms  face both more vocal calls to permit conten- tious speech and more compelling reasons to  curate it – not just under pressure from laws,  but of their own accord.  regulaTion by plaTforms  Social media platforms are eager to keep the  safe harbor protections enshrined in Section  230. But at this point, all of them are taking  advantage  of  the  second  half  of  its  protec- tion:  nearly  all  platforms  impose  their  own  rules,  and  police  their  sites  for  offending   content and behavior. In fact, their ceaseless  and systematic interventions cut much deeper  than the law requires. Both in terms of their  impact on public discourse, and for the lived  experience  of  its  users,  the  rules  these  plat- forms  impose  themselves  probably  matter  more than the legal restrictions under which  they function. So, while part of the question  must  be  how  platforms  are  governed,  an  equally important question is how platforms  govern   Citron,  2014;  DeNardis  &  Hackl,  2015; Gillespie, 2015; Grimmelmann, 2015;  Humphreys, 2013; Jeong, 2015; MacKinnon  et  al.,  2014;  Matias  et  al.,  2015;  Obar  &  Wildman,  2015;  Reagle,  2015;  Roth,  2015;  Stein, 2013; van Dijck, 2013; Wagner, 2013 . There are clear reasons why social media  platforms,  though  not  legally  required  to  do  so,  police  the  content  of  their  sites  and  the  behavior  of  their  users  –  mostly  eco- nomic  reasons,  though  not  exclusively  so.  Troubling  content  like  pornography  and  graphic  violence  may  scare  off  wary  adver- tisers, who are not keen to see their products  paired with an X-rated video or a xenopho- bic  rant.  Platforms  worry  about  users  leav- ing if they’re overwhelmed by porn or trolls.  No  matter  how  successful  or  established  or  near-monopolistic,  platforms  all  fear  users  flocking en masse to a competitor. While the  major platforms have developed clever ways  to  keep  users  within  their  ecosystem,  they  remain  haunted  by  the  fact  that  alternatives  are “just one click away.” A graveyard of past  social media services like MySpace and Digg  linger in their discussions as cautionary tales,  of  how  a  successful  platform  can  collapse  when users decide that it is not serving their  interests  or  that  a  better  alternative  exists.  And,  the  content  and  behavior  users  may  find perfectly acceptable does not always fit  neatly with the platforms’ effort to protect its  public brand. Revisions of site policies often  occur when a new company purchases a plat- form and struggles to incorporate its permis- sive ethos amid its other services.23  But  even  here,  platforms  face  a  double- edged  sword:  too  little  curation,  and  users    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  263  may  leave  to  avoid  the  toxic  environment  that  has  taken  hold;  too  much  moderation,  and  users  may  still  go,  either  because  what  was  promised  to  be  an  open  platform  feels  too  intrusive  or  too antiseptic. This  is  espe- cially true as platforms seek to expand their  user  base:  platforms  typically  begin  with  users  who  are  more  homogenous,  share  the  goal of protecting and nurturing the platform,  and who may be able to solve some tensions  through  informal  means;  as  their  user  base  broadens  it  also  diversifies,  and  platforms  find  themselves  hosting  users  and  whole  communities  with  very  different  value  sys- tems, and who look to the platform to police  content and resolve disputes. And to be fair,  these  economic  considerations  are  always  intertwined with other kinds: the deeply felt  commitment  of  the  platform  operators  for  nurturing  a  healthy  community  or  encour- aging the best creative output of their users;  a sense of public obligation, especially as a  platform  grows  and  exerts  greater  influence  on  the  public  landscape;  and  in  the  face  of  criticism leveled by angry users, journalists,  or activists.  These  platforms  must  constantly  police  the  pornographic,  the  harassing,  and  the  obscene. There is no avoiding it entirely. But  doing so can be a politically fraught exercise,  particularly when the politics of visibility is  involved  Bakardjieva, 2009; Couldry, 2015;  Dahlberg,  2007;  Gray,  2009;  Gross,  2002;  Thompson, 2005 . I mean ‘visibility’ in the  sense  that  groups  seeking  legitimacy  some- times struggle politically simply to be seen,  against the wishes of those who would mar- ginalize  and  silence  them,  such  as  around  the issue of gay rights or public breastfeed- ing; visibility in the sense that some kinds of  antagonism between groups go unnoticed or  uncommented on, such as the culture of vio- lence against women; visibility in the sense  that one group’s speech is silenced as poten- tially dangerous to others, as in fundamental- ist  Islamic  propaganda;  and  visibility  in  the  sense that some kinds of images are seen as  potentially dangerous to those who choose to   consume  them,  such  as  ‘self-harm’  images  that  may  support  anorexic,  cutting,  or  sui- cidal behavior. I do not mean to equate these  efforts. But they all, in some form or another  and  for  very  different  ends,  seek  to  be  ren- dered  visible,  in  places  where  visibility  can  be  a  step  towards  legibility  and  legitimacy.  Sometimes  visibility  is  not  just  a  political  accomplishment, but one that must also over- come  the  mechanics  and  governance  of  the  medium through which they hope to appear   Bucher,  2012;  Milan,  2015;  Thompson,  2005 .  With   these  unavoidable  and  perhaps  unsolvable  contentious  politics  increasingly  inhabiting their sites, social media platforms  have not only had to develop and refine their  rules and develop more sophisticated means  of policing their sites. They have also had to  develop  their  own  logics  underpinning  how  and  why  they  intervene. This  is  not  to  sug- gest that their policies are always conceptu- ally coherent, in principle or in application;  most  have  developed  over  time,  often  in  an  ad  hoc  fashion,  often  after  having  to  face  a  contentious  issue  they  were  unprepared  for.  But  out  of  each  site  composing  this  or  that  rule out of this or that thought process, there  are certain kinds of approaches that seem to  have coalesced.  Where the Lines are Drawn  When  it  comes  to  the  specifics,  the  guide- lines at the prominent, general-purpose plat- forms  are  strikingly  similar.  This  makes  sense: these platforms encounter many of the  same  kinds  of  problematic  content  and  behavior,  they  look  to  each  other  for  guid- ance  on  how  to  address  them,  and  they  are  situated together in a longer history of speech  regulation that offers well-worn signposts on  how and why to intervene. Most have some  rule prohibiting or limiting the following:   	 sexual content and pornography  	  representations of violence and obscenity   264   	 harassment of other users  	 hate speech  	  	  representations of or promotion of self-harm representations of or promotion of illegal activity,  particularly drug use.  Additionally,  some  platforms  have  rules  about  using  a  ‘real’  identity,  or  about  what  can  and  cannot  be  done  under  the  cloak  of  anonymity. Some include advice or pointers  for ensuring the smooth working of the site  and  the  quality  of  its  offerings.  And  some  prohibit certain forms of commercial activity  and self-promotion. Platforms differ on how  they  draw  each  of  these  lines,  what  kind  of  caveats they are willing to consider, and what  kinds  of  consequences  are  leveled  against  offenders.  One  might  dismiss  these  guidelines  as  mere  window  dressing  –  performances  of  principles,  ringing  so  clear  and  reasonable,  that do not in fact have much to do with the  actual  enforcement  of  policy  on  the  site,  which  can  often  be  more  slapdash,  strate- gic,  or  hypocritical.  I  find  it  more  convinc- ing  to  say  that  these  are  statements  of  both  policy and principle – struggled over by the  platform  operators  at  some  moments  and  ignored  at  others,  deployed  when  they  are  helpful  and  sidestepped  when  they  are  con- straining. They do important discursive work,  performing but also revealing how platforms  see themselves as ambivalent arbiters of pub- lic  propriety.  These  guidelines  matter,  not  only  when  they  are  enforced,  and  not  only  to lend strength to the particular norms they  represent. Platforms adjust their guidelines in  relation to each other, and smaller sites look  to  the  larger  ones  for  guidance,  sometimes  borrowing language and policies wholesale.  They perform, and therefore reveal in oblique  ways, how platforms see themselves as pub- lic arbiters of cultural value. They are also by  no means the end of the story, as no guide- lines  in  the  abstract  could  possibly  line  up  neatly with how they are enforced in practice. Looking at these guidelines together, it is  clear  that  these  platforms  develop  rules  not   just  in  anticipation  of  inappropriate  con- tent and activity, but in response to it. They  undergo a routinized internal process: content  policy teams must from time to time decide  how to translate a new legal obligation into  an  actionable  rule,  react  to  the  emergence  of  a  category  of  content  they  would  like  to  curtail, and respond to surges of complaints  from  users.  Unanticipated  kinds  of  content  or behavior may be spotted first through the  complaints  of  users,  then  formalized  into  new rules or written into existing ones. And  changes can also come in response to outcries  and public controversies. In these guidelines,  we can see the scars of past challenges.  Enforcement and the   Problem of Scale  While  the  law  invited  early  platforms  to  enjoy  a  hands-off  safe  harbor  like  ISPs  and  other  conduits,  the  operators  of  early  plat- forms  were  also  steeped  in  the  tradition  of  online community management. In the early  days of the web, while ISPs were fending off  liability  for  pornography  and  copyright  infringement,  online  communities  quickly  discovered that communities need care: they  had to address the challenges of interpersonal  conflict  and  obscene  speech,  and  develop  forms  of  governance  that  protected  their  community and embodied democratic proce- dures  that  matched  their  values  and  the  values  of  their  users.  Community  manage- ment was often the work of volunteers, either  the  webmaster  or  site  manager,  or  partici- pants  in  the  communities  who  took  on  the  role  of  moderation  themselves   Postigo,  2009 .  Sometimes  moderation  emerged  in  response to a shock to the community: when,  for example, a troll first dramatically disrupts  a  community  that  had,  perhaps  naively,  assumed  that  everyone  wanted  the  same  things, and thus required no governance at all   Dibbell,  1993 .  Community  management  has  taken  many  forms,  perhaps  as  many  forms  as  there  were  online  communities:    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  265  from the benevolent tyranny of a webmaster,  to  public  arbitration  among  an  entire  com- munity,  to  ad  hoc  councils  appointed  to  determine policies and dole out punishments.  As  communities  grew  and  changed  over  time, new members and new conflicts chal- lenged these forms of governance  Bergstrom,  2011; Kerr & Kelleher, 2015; Lampe et al.,  2014; Shaw and Hill, 2014 ; sometimes they  adjusted, sometimes the groups faltered and  people moved on.  Such  moderation  persists  in  the  contem- porary  equivalents  of  online  communities.  Many of the operators of early platforms were  also  steeped  in  the  tradition  of  online  com- munity management, the set of practices and  knowledges that emerged out of maintaining  these  online  communities  over  time  and  in  the  face  of  growth,  change,  and  challenge.  But the key reason these approaches are ill- suited to social media platforms is scale. The  moderation of online communities depended  on community members who knew the web- master,  regulars  who  knew  each  other,  and  a  history  of  interactions  that  provided  the  familiarity and trust necessary for a modera- tor  to  arbitrate  when  members  disagreed.24  Tough  cases  could  be  debated  as  a  collec- tive, policies could be weighed and changed  together.  This  was  the  scale  of  the  forum,  rather than the demos  Forsyth, 2016 . Some  social  media  platforms  that  began  at  this  scale continue to pursue forms of community  moderation by retaining some structural form  of groups within the platform. For instance,  Reddit  depends  on  volunteers  to  moderate  particular  subreddits,  and  Facebook  expects  the managers of a Facebook Group to moder- ate it  although the site will also respond to  complaints about Groups just as it does any  other kind of content . But as these platforms  have grown in scale and ambition, the scale  necessary  for  community  moderation  has  become increasingly untenable.  In addition, on large-scale platforms there  is simply too much content and activity being  posted  to  support  a  proactive  review  pro- cess, where a moderator would examine each   contribution  before  it  appeared  on  the  site.  Apple is a notable exception, in that it reviews  every iPhone app before making it available  in their app store; but Apple fields hundreds  of submissions a day, not hundreds of thou- sands. And  it  has  certainly  come  under  fire  for  failures  in  judgment,  both  for  apps  they  rejected  and  ones  they  approved   Hestres,  2013 . Nearly all platforms must embrace a  ‘publish-then-filter’  Shirky, 2008  approach:  user  posts  are  immediately  public,  without  review, and platforms can remove question- able content only after the fact.25 This means  that even heinous content may get published,  at  least  briefly,  and  criminal  behavior  may  occur  and have its intended impact  before  anything is done in response. Plenty of con- tent  that  violates  site  guidelines  remains  online for days, or years, because of the sheer  challenge of policing platforms as immense  as these.  The  approaches  social  media  platforms  take, not just to content moderation but to all  the  ways  they  manage  information,  are  tied  to  this  immense  scale.  Content  is  policed  at  scale,  and  most  complaints  are  fielded  at  scale. More importantly, their understanding  of the problems has been formed and shaped  by working at this scale. What to do with a  questionable  photo  or  bad  actor  changes  when  you’re  facing  not  one  violation  but  hundreds exactly like it and thousands much  like  it,  but  slightly  different  in  a  thousand  ways. This is not just a difference of size; it is  fundamentally a different problem. For large- scale platforms, moderation is industrial, not  artisanal.  This  raises  a  legal  question,  in  that  it  is  arguably impossible for a platform to assure  that no illegal content or behavior will appear  there.  Section  230  answers  this  very  well;  any  regime  that  replaced  it  would  have  to  grapple with this challenge. And it raises an  ethical challenge, in that users cannot avoid  obscenity  or  be  protected  from  harassers  with complete certainty. I say it is arguably  impossible because the resources that could  be put toward this effort are limited only by    266  convention.  We  can’t  imagine  a  platform  employing  enough  people  to  review  every  piece  of  content  before  it  is  posted,  but  in  principle they could; and given current expec- tations, users would probably be unwilling to  accept the delay this would impose on their  status updates and shared photos. These con- straints  are,  in  fact,  movable.  The  Chinese  government, for instance, employs hundreds  of thousands of people to scour social media  for political criticism and blocks many web- sites and keyword searches automatically.26 I  am not suggesting that China’s approach is in  any way ideal, nor that social media contribu- tions should queue up to wait for publication.  I am only noting that what counts as impos- sible  only  appears  so  to  U.S.  users.  In  the  West, we accept that platforms cannot review  content  before  it  is  posted,  reject  the  delay  that would impose, and yet also demand that  platforms  respond  quickly  and  consistently  to  our  complaints.  In  lieu  of  shifting  these  expectations  themselves,  social  media  plat- forms must accomplish the work of modera- tion within these limits.  The Human Labor of   Content Moderation  Large-scale  social  media  platforms  have  developed intricate and complex systems for  conducting content moderation at scale. This  requires immense human resources, if not at  quite the Chinese scale.27 These people gen- erally  labor  in  obscurity,  some  set  at  a  dis- tance  from  the  platforms  and  its  internal  aims,  and  often  with  little  oversight.  And  each  layer  of  moderation  introduces  an  ele- ment  of  ambiguity  and  potential  bias  into  what  remains  a  largely  opaque  process   Roberts, 2016 .  At the top, most platforms have an internal  policy team charged with overseeing modera- tion. They set the rules, oversee their enforce- ment, adjudicate the particularly hard cases,  and  craft  new  policies  in  response.  These  are,  by  and  large,  small  teams,  often  just  a   handful  of  full-time  employees.  At  a  few  platforms  they  are  an  independent  division,  while at others they sit under the umbrella of  ‘trust and safety,’ ‘community outreach,’ cus- tomer service, or technical support. At others,  setting  policy  and  addressing  hard  cases  is  handled in a more ad hoc way, by the leader- ship with advice from legal counsel; an engi- neer may find themselves asked to weigh in  on what counts as harassment or stalking, in  their spare time.28 These groups are obscure  to users, by design and policy. They are dif- ficult  for  users  to  reach,  and  the  statements  and  policy  changes  they  generate  are  often  released in the voice of the company itself. All  together  they  are  a  surprisingly  small  com- munity  of  people,  based  overwhelmingly  in  the San Francisco area, and individuals tend  to  move  from  platform  to  platform  in  their  career.29 At the scale at which most platforms  operate, these internal teams would be insuf- ficient by themselves. Still, they have an out- sized influence on where the lines are drawn,  what kinds of punishments are enforced, and  the philosophical approach the team and the  platforms take to governance itself.  At  many  companies,  there  is  a  substan- tially  larger  group  of  people  who  provide  a  frontline  review  of  specific  content  and  incidents  beneath  the  internal  moderation  team. They might be employed by the plat- form, at the home office or in satellite offices  around  the  world  in  places  like  Dublin  and  Hyderabad.  But  more  and  more  commonly  they  are  employed  on  a  contract  basis:  as  independent  contractors  through  third-party  ‘temp’  companies,  or  as  on-demand  labor  employed through crowdwork services such  as Amazon’s  Mechanical  Turk,  Upwork,  or  TaskUs  –  or  both,  in  a  two-tiered  system.30  These clickworkers are obscured, both inten- tionally  and  by  circumstance.  Many  are  in  parts  of  the  world  where  labor  is  cheap,  especially  the  Philippines  and  India,  far  from  both  the  platform  and  the  users  they  are moderating; they are also distanced from  the company through contract labor arrange- ments  and  the  intervening  interfaces  of  the    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  267  crowdwork platforms that employ them and  organize their labor.31  These  clickworkers  are  used  as  a  first  response  team,  fielding  complaints  from  users and making quick decisions as to how  to respond. Quick can mean seconds per com- plaint, which means each user is getting very  little  attention,  and  clickworker  moderators  are facing a torrent of atrocities.32 Most com- plaints are now fielded as a matter of course;  only the most difficult to judge are directed up  to the internal content team for further delib- eration. Moderators are generally unaware of  the identity of the user, and provided little of  the surrounding context – the back and forth  of a conversation, that user’s previous posts,  etc.  Users  may  expect  these  judgments  to  weigh competing values, show cultural sensi- tivity, and appear to the user as fair and con- sistent. Instead, they are being distilled from  their meaningful context and rushed under the  pressure to be responsive to an enormous and  endless queue of complaints. Some are begin- ning  to  worry  about  the  psychological  toll  of this work: a lawsuit was recently brought  against  Microsoft  by  two  content  modera- tors suffering from post-traumatic stress since  their  work  reviewing  gruesome  images  and  violent posts.33  Some  sites  continue  to  depend  on  com- munity moderators in some form. Reddit, for  instance, has smaller, persistent ‘subreddits’  that  exist  within  the  larger  platform,  each  overseen  by  moderators,  and Wikipedia  has  an ‘administrator’ class of superusers who do  other kinds of back-end work on the platform.  Facebook  Groups  give  the  founder  of  the  group limited powers to include and exclude  users,  delete  comments,  etc. These  commu- nity  moderators  are  usually  volunteers  and  thus independent of the platform itself, with  their own commitment to the group for which  they are responsible. They may be enforcing  rules  that  were  generated  by  and  consented  to by the community, with their help, making  enforcement easier. On the other hand, they  are  typically  volunteers,  usually  uncompen- sated  and  often  underappreciated.  In  most   cases, these moderators are given tools by the  platform that make possible the enforcement  of group policies, such as the ability to delete  content  or  suspend  users. Typically  they  do  not  have  the  authority  to  extend  any  puni- tive consequences beyond the group they’re  responsible  for  –  they  can  ban  a  user  from  their specific group, but not from the entire  platform  –  which  significantly  limits  their  scope,  and  allows  troublemakers  to  move  across groups and platforms with near impu- nity.In  a  tenuous  position  in  relationship  to  the platform, such moderators are often over- worked but undersupported, provided a weak  mandate for the role they’re expected to play,  sometimes invited backstage and sometimes  held at arms-length.34  Enormous  platforms  face  an  enormous  moderation  project,  but  they  also  have  an  enormous resource close at hand: users them- selves.  Most  platforms  now  invite  users  to  “flag”  problematic  content  and  behavior,  generating a queue of complaints that can be  fed to the platform moderators – typically, to  its  army  of  crowdworkers  first  –  to  adjudi- cate. And  some  give  users  tools  to  rate  and  block content, and designs mechanisms into  the  system  to  filter  content  towards  those  who want to see it, and away from those who  don’t. The implications of these two models  are  important,  and  I  will  address  them  in  a  moment. But in terms of a labor force, both  depend on the crowd to police itself, though  the  populations  on  which  they  depend  and  the  dilemmas  each  must  grapple  with  are  different.  Flagging is now widespread across social  media platforms, and has settled in as a norm  in  the  logic  of  the  social  media  interface,  alongside  favoriting  and  reposting. A  small  icon or link beneath a post, image, or video  offers the user a pull-down menu facilitating  their complaint, often with submenus to clas- sify the nature of the offense. In the earliest  days of contemporary platforms, such mech- anisms were nonexistent or buried in the help  pages.  Platforms  have  since  made  it  easier  and easier to find these flags, though in some    268  cases criticism has dogged specific platforms  for these mechanisms being inadequate.  On  the  one  hand,  flagging  puts  the  work  of complaining right at the point of offense,  in front of those most motivated to complain.  On the other hand, it is optional. This means  that  the  population  of  users  who  deputize  themselves  to  flag  content  are  those  most  motivated  to  do  so.  Platforms  also  describe  flagging as an expression of the community.  But are the users who flag ‘representative’ of  the larger user base, and what does it mean  for  the  legitimacy  of  the  system  if  they’re  not?  Who  flags,  and  why,  is  very  hard  to  know.  Platforms  are  tight-lipped  about  how  many  users  flag,  what  percentage  of  those  who do flag provide the most flags, how often  the platform decided to remove or retain con- tent  that’s  been  flagged,  etc.   Crawford  and  Gillespie, 2016 .  Recently,  some  platforms  have  experi- mented  with  granting  some  users  the  status  of  ‘superflagger,’  prioritizing  their  flags  over  others. These users might be law enforcement  organizations, activist organizations concerned  with a specific kind of violation or protecting a  specific population of users, or long-time users  who  are  recognized  as  reliable.  Generally,  who they are remains opaque to users. While  platforms can gain insight over time into the  reliability and evenhandedness of a particular  group of flaggers, this can be extremely taxing  on the people and groups who sign on to play  this role  Matias et al., 2015 .  The  alternative  is  for  platforms  to  ask  users to rate their own content when it is first  posted, and then provide filtering mechanisms  so that users can avoid content they want to  avoid. Unlike flagging, this enlists all users,  which  distributes  the  work  more  equitably  and diminishes the concern that those doing  the flagging do not represent the whole com- munity. The challenge with this approach is  achieving full participation and consistency.  Platforms don’t want to introduce too many  steps at the moment a user posts, worried that  an  unwieldy  and  multi-click  interface  will  discourage  participation.  So  any  user-rating   process must either be lean and depend heav- ily on defaults, or it must happen less often.  On Tumblr, for example, users are asked to  rate  their  entire  blog,  rather  than  each  post,  and  the  default  rating  is  ‘safe.’  While  this  makes  the  interface  quite  simple,  the  rat- ing  can  only  serve  as  a  blunt  instrument:  a  Tumblr user who rarely posts risqué content  and a user who regularly posts pornography  are rated the same, as ‘NSFW’  Not Safe For  Work .  Users  will  inevitably  have  different  interpretations of what is ‘adult’ or ‘violent’  or  ‘not  for  children,’  especially  regarding  their  own  posts,  leaving  the  platform  with  limited  means  for  ensuring  consistency  across users. Many platforms penalize users  for failing to rate adult material, or for doing  so  in  ways  that  wildly  differ  from  the  plat- form moderator’s opinion of it, or from users  who come across it.  All  of  this  labor,  from  the  internal  team  setting  the  rules  and  adjudicating  the  hard- est  cases,  to  crowdworkers  reviewing  each  bit of flagged content, to volunteer modera- tors overseeing groups within a platform, to  flaggers lodging their complaints, to all users  enlisted  to  rate  content,  represent  a  set  of  tiered solutions to the problem of scale. Many  platforms use a combination of some or all,  and  the  workflow  that  moves  questionable  content from one tier to the next may differ.  Of course, there is the question of who does  the  judgment  at  each  level  and  according  to  what  criteria.  But  many  of  the  problems  with  these  systems  of  platform  governance  live  in  the  uncertainties  between  this  multi- tiered system: how are judgments at one level  translated into consequences at another; how  are criteria articulated at one level conveyed  to  another. And  these  uncertainties  breed  in  the shadow of an apparatus that remains dis- tinctly opaque to public scrutiny.  To Remove or to Filter  Platforms also have two choices for what to  do  with  offending  content:  remove  it,  or    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  269  mark  it  as  such  and  help  users  avoid  it.  In  practice,  most  platforms  do  some  combina- tion  of  both.  Even  permissive  platforms  remove the most heinous and illegal material,  and  even  the  most  sensitive  platforms  often  have a category of content that earns an age  rating or warning. The difference tends to be  where the balance is drawn between the two  approaches, and how that balance is justified.  But the two approaches have different impli- cations as forms of governance.  It   is  commonplace  for  platforms   to  remove  content  deemed  offensive  and  users  deemed harassing. Content that offends one  user  is  likely  to  offend  others,  so  removing  it  addresses  multiple  points  of  offense;  if  it’s  gone,  it  cannot  offend  again.  It  demon- strates  a  decisive  commitment  to  protecting  the public, allows the platform to signal that  it does not tolerate such content or behavior,  and  avoids  associating  the  company  brand  with something offensive. And removal saves  human  resources  later,  having  to  adjudicate  on the same content or user again and again. On  the  other  hand,  removal  comes  with  challenges.  It  is  the  harshest  approach,  in  terms of its consequences. It renders the con- tent or the user invisible on the platform. It is  a blunt instrument, an all-or-nothing determi- nation,  removing  that  content  for  everyone,  not  just  for  those  who  were  offended. And  it runs counter to the principles of so many  platforms: open participation, unencumbered  interaction,  and  the  protection  of  speech.  Content  policy  managers  are  aware  of  this  irony;  several  commented  on  how  odd  it  is  that, on a platform committed to open partici- pation, their job is to kick some people off.  Disgruntled  users  who  have  had  con- tent  removed  or  been  banned  from  a  social  media platform sometimes cry “censorship.”  It  is  a  powerful  claim,  but  it  is  not  entirely  accurate. Users suspended by a platform, or  even  banned  permanently,  are  not  entirely  shut out, as they can continue to participate  on other platforms and on the broader web.  This  makes  it  hard  to  call  this  censorship  in  the  strict  sense.  Moreover,  “censorship”   presumes  a  right  to  speak,  and  usually  the  kind  of  legal  speech  rights  enshrined  in  the  US First Amendment and similar protections  around the world. But the First Amendment  and its corollaries elsewhere are protections  against  intrusions  of  the  state,  not  private  companies. There are currently no legal obli- gations  requiring  social  media  platforms  to  allow their users to speak, or preventing them  from  restricting  their  users’  speech,  even  if  those restrictions are capricious or unfair.  Still,  removal  from  a  social  media  plat- form  matters.  For  a  user,  being  suspended  or banned from a social media platform can  have  real  consequences  –  detaching  them  from their social circle and loved ones, inter- ruptions  in  the  professional  life,  and  inter- rupting their access to other platforms. There  may  be  other  platforms  available,  but  they  cannot  take  with  them  their  entire  network  of people, their accumulated history of inter- actions, or their personal archive of content.  And being excluded from the highest-profile  platforms, where the most valuable audiences  can be built, matters especially. It’s why the  common  admonition,  “if  you  don’t  like  it  here, just leave” is insufficient when it comes  to  culturally  and  politically  contentious  speech. The longer we stay on platforms and  the larger they grow, the more we are com- pelled to stick with them and the higher the  cost to leave.  With  this,  the  threat  of  removal,  real  or  perceived,  has  real  effects.  And  in  that  sense,  removing  content  from  a  platform  altogether  represents  a  deeper  cut  in  terms  of  the  protection  of  speech.  The  US  tradi- tion  of  First  Amendment  jurisprudence  has  long  established  that  preempting  speech  entirely  is  a  more  problematic  intervention  than  imposing  penalties  for  it  after  the  fact  – because it silences that speech in the pro- cess  Armijo, 2013; Balkin, 2014; Meyerson,  2001 . Removing users does more than limit  speech, it interrupts their ability to participate  on  that  platform,  and  removes  all  of  their  future speech as well. At the same time, on  most  platforms  suspended  users  can  simply    270  create a new profile and post again, turning  platform governance into an endless game of  whack-a-mole,  where  content  reappears  in  slight  variation,  under  new  names,  or  from  dummy accounts that can only be identified  in hindsight.  Removals can also feel like – or be criti- cized as – a judgment of the user themselves.  While  the  platform  may  have  merely  deter- mined  that  the  content  in  question  was  sta- tistically  similar  to  other  deleted  content,  the  person  who  posted  it  may  feel  that  its  deletion is a judgment of them. This is espe- cially  problematic  when  what  was  deleted  was,  from  the  user’s  perspective,  a  positive  expression of themselves: for example, when  users,  especially  women,  post  pictures  that,  while  they  do  expose  their  bodies,  repre- sent a moment of physical triumph – giving  birth,  breastfeeding  their  newborn,  surviv- ing a mastectomy or other surgery – only to  have those photos deleted as inappropriate or  pornographic.35  Finally,  because  removal  is  so  blunt  an  instrument, it opens platforms up to charges  of  subjectivity,  hypocrisy,  political  con- servatism,  and  self-interest.  For  the  largest  platforms, content moderation will never be  complete or consistent, which means that any  user who feels their deleted post or image was  fine  can  easily  find  content  still  on  the  site  that they think is worse. Explanations for why  that  more  egregious  content  remains  rarely  give the platform the benefit of the doubt: in  that  inconsistency,  aggrieved  users  see  sub- jectivity,  hypocrisy,  and  bias. And  removals  that seem to benefit the platform in some way  can  look  self-interested  –  or,  to  put  it  less  generously,  platforms  may  remove  content  they want to do away with under the guise of  content moderation, on behalf of their com- munity.  Editorial  review  can  creep  beyond  its  stated  intentions.  What  may  be  justified  as  ensuring  quality  content   and  may  really  be about establishing a way to extract fees   can  drift  into  moral  judgments.  Having  put  themselves in a position of apparent or actual  oversight, platforms can also find themselves   saddled with some sense of responsibility, to  users and to the public at large.  The  second  option  is  to  allow  obscene  content or problematic users to stay, but rate  them so that users who care not to encoun- ter them will be automatically filtered away.  This is arguably a less invasive approach. It  allows  platforms  to  proclaim  their  commit- ment to protecting the speech of their users,  though it also opens them to criticism, rang- ing from being too permissive, even harbor- ing pornographers and terrorists. If the right  balance is struck, the platform can enjoy the  traffic  and  revenue  both  generated  by  users  seeking  illicit  content,  and  by  users  who  want  a  ‘clean’  experience  of  the  platform.  For permissive platforms that have developed  a  sturdy  community  around  adult  interests,  or  pride  themselves  on  allowing  unfettered  debate,  or  position  themselves  as  hands-off  when  it  comes  to  what  users  do,  it  offers  a  mode of governance aligned with these aims. This  is  not  unlike  how  adult  content  has  sometimes  been  handled  before:  the  adult  movies in the back room of the video store, the  magazines on the top shelf at the newsstand,  the  pornographic  cable  channels  encrypted.  But instead of a cashier looking at a driver’s  license  at  the  point  of  sale,  social  media  platforms  must  patrol  users  algorithmically.  Some form of ‘safesearch’ mechanism must  recognize which users are in a safe mode, and  refuse to deliver to them the unsafe material.  Instead  of  blocking  content  at  the  point  of  sale,  they’re  blocked  at  the  point  of  search,  which  means  the  very  same  mechanism  we  expect  to  help  us  find  content  is  also  being  used by the platform to prevent us from find- ing it. This can have real cultural and political  consequences, like when Tumblr blocked the  term ‘gay’ because it is commonly associ- ated with pornographic images, and thereby  blocked  all  other  non-pornographic  content  similarly tagged.36  This  kind  of  technical  choreography  can  be harder for users to see, and is not always  where one might expect it. For instance, all  of  the  major  search  engines  offer  users  a    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  271  “safesearch”  mode  –  if  I  don’t  want  to  see  pornographic  results,  I  tick  a  box  and  the  search engine filters them out. But the major  search engines go one step further: even for  users  who  have  safesearch  off,  the  search  engines nevertheless filter out adult results –  if they think your search query is an innocu- ous one, one that is not seeking adult content.  In other words, even if I have safesearch off,  if I search for ‘movies’ I will not see links to  adult movie sites – it will deliver only non- explicit  results,  using  the  same  algorithmic  moderation as if I had safesearch turned on.  If I search for ‘porn movies,’ then I get the  adult  content.  Search  engines  assume  all  users do not want accidental porn: better to  make the user actually looking for porn refine  their query than to deliver porn to a user did  not  expect  to  receive.  Reasonable,  perhaps:  but  the  intervention  is  a  hidden  one,  and  in  fact  runs  counter  to  my  stated  preferences.  Search  engines  not  only  guess  the  meaning  and  intent  of  my  search,  based  on  the  little  they know about me, they must in fact defy  the one bit of agency I have asserted here, in  turning safesearch off.  Finally,  these  filtering  approaches  can  offer  the  platform  compelling  solutions  to  the legal demands of specific nations, but in  ways  that  may  differ  from  the  intent  of  the  law. For instance, when Germany, Singapore,  and  South  Korea  all  complained  to  Flickr  that, by allowing explicit content so long as  the user rates it as such, it was violating their  laws  restricting  access  to  pornography  for  minors, Flickr could have instituted a check- point  requiring  users  to  confirm  their  age.  Instead, they simply designed the system so  that users who are visiting Flickr from, say, a  German IP address, simply cannot turn safe- search  off.  They  will  only  ever  see  content  rated  “moderate”  or  “safe”  photos,  no  mat- ter their age. In other words, laws protecting  minors  become  technical  measures  restrict- ing adults. When the High Court of Pakistan  ordered the entire Facebook site blocked for  Pakistani  users  because  of  one  particular  Facebook group encouraging people to draw   the image of Mohammed, Facebook removed  the  group  –  only  from  the  search  results  of  users located in Pakistan. For those users, the  offending page was simply not there; even its  removal  was  invisible.  Technical  measures  that  keep  some  users  away  from  some  con- tent, while continuing to display it to others,  are a convenient solution, but raise troubling  questions  about  the  power  of  social  media  platforms  to  offer  different  media  to  differ- ent publics, in ways that are hard to discern  or criticize.  conclusion: The quesTion of  responsibiliTy  Questions  about  platforms  and  the  harms  they host are typically not framed in terms of  responsibility – it is too often about liability  and  its  avoidance.  We  tend  to  defend  plat- forms as free conduits of speech until we are  too troubled by something that freely moves  through their system. When the government,  or the aggrieved user, or the public at large,  demands  that  the  platform  ‘do  something’  about  the  problem,  that  request  generally  lies somewhere between a genuine belief in  the  platform’s  responsibility  and  a  more  practical  hope  that  they  are  best  positioned  to  intervene.  It  may  be  a  convenience  or  a  strategy:  platforms  do  have  the  means  to  intervene in the circulation of abhorrent con- tent and at the moment of abhorrent behav- ior.  Pursuing  individual  bad  actors  is  difficult, consumes time and resources, and  has  too  little  impact:  getting  a  platform  to  intervene systematically promises to have a  much  broader  impact.  But  platforms  also  make  human  behavior  highly  visible,  lead- ing  to  what  Mueller  calls  a  ‘fallacy  of  dis- placed  control’:  since  the  problem  is  most  obvious  there,  we  tend  to  assign  too  much  blame  to  the  platform  itself.  When  this  comes  in  the  form  of  a  legal  imposition,  it  can  look  like  a  displacement  of  individual  accountability:  ‘Instead  of  punishing  bad    272  behavior,  we  strive  to  control  the  tool  that  was  used  by  the  bad  actor s .  Instead  of  eliminating illegal materials or activities, we  propose to eliminate internet access to ille- gal  materials  or  activities’   Mueller,  2015:  807 . Platforms get the burden and the blame  for what users say and do.  But,  in  principle,  there  might  be  good   reason to think of platforms as bearing some  responsibility.  Copyright  law  points  to  at  least two ways in which intermediaries could  be  held  responsible  for  the  activity  of  their  users. First, if they gain financially from the  illicit  transaction,  and  second,  if  they  have  some material effect on the transaction, mak- ing it easier or expanding its scope.37 In the  case of offensive content and behavior, simi- lar questions could be asked: does a platform  pair  advertising  with  offensive  content?  Do  they materially enhance the ability of a bad  actor to harass or threaten another user?  Then  we  might  consider  other  versions  of  platform  responsibility  as  well. Are  they  responsible because, by their very existence,  they connect people who would not be con- nected otherwise? Do they have a responsibil- ity  though this runs counter to Section 230   once they promise to moderate? Do they have  a  greater  responsibility  as  they  grow  larger,  as they displace other central venues of pub- lic  life,  or  if  they  gain  monopolistic  power  in  a  particular  genre  of  services?  Some  of  these questions depend on the role we think  platforms  play  in  shaping  the  activity  and  discourse  they  host,  materially  and  institu- tionally. Some depend on what kinds of pub- lic  obligations  we  are  willing  to  impose  on  private institutions of any kind.  While Section 230 may have tried to pro- vide both sides of a safe harbor from liability  for  user  content  and  behavior  –  safe  harbor  from  being  held  accountable  for  it,  and  the  legal  freedom  to  intervene  on  users’  behalf  without being then held accountable for how  extensively they do so – platforms are in some  ways hamstrung between these two positions.  They are indeed intermediaries, stuck in the  middle in both the legal and practical sense:   halfway between users with different values,  halfway between policymakers and the peo- ple they seek to regulate, halfway between a  conduit and a curator, and halfway between  the  pressure  of  internal  aims  and  external  demands. But they also get to play both sides,  where  they  enjoy  all  the  right  to  intervene,  but with little responsibility about how they  do so and under what forms of oversight.  The  language  of  the  impartial  conduit  is  still powerful, though it seems to be dimin- ishing in the glare of the most alarming con- tent and egregious behavior being circulated  through  and  perpetrated  on  these  platforms,  and in light of the different legal approaches  around  the  world.  Even  in  the West,  with  a  robust safe harbor principle, we oblige plat- forms  to  remove  illegal  content  like  child  pornography, and are considering other kinds  of  obligations,  such  as  revenge  porn  and  extremist  content  –  governments  and  pub- lics are not only willing to make exceptions,  they are beginning to reconsider their starting  assumptions about whether platforms should  be  responsible  for  what  happens  on  them.  And users, faced with direct harms coming at  them on their chosen platform, quickly adjust  their understanding of that platform, from an  unfettered space in which to play to a respon- sible guardian failing to protect them. These  are not just questions about the proper legal  rules  for  intermediaries,  they  are  broader  societal questions about how bad something  has to be to justify adjusting a general princi- ple. This question falls heavily on platforms,  sometimes asked not to intervene, sometimes  required to, and shapes how we think about  how to govern them, and how they govern.  In addition, the policies of the major social  media  platforms  have  themselves  become  a  terrain  for  longstanding  debates  about  the  content  and  character  of  public  discourse.  It is not surprising that our dilemmas about  terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, about  gay sexuality, about misogyny and violence  against  women,  so  front  and  center  as  pub- lic concerns, should erupt here too. The con- troversies  these  sites  face  can  be  read  as  a    regulation oF and by PlatForMs  273  barometer of our society’s pressing concerns  about public discourse more broadly: which  representations  of  sexuality  are  empower- ing and which are explicit, and according to  whose  judgment;  what  is  newsworthy  and  what is gruesome, and who draws the line; do  words do harm and exclude people from dis- cussion, or must participants in public debate  endure even caustic contributions; how do we  balance freedom of speech with the values of  the  community,  with  the  safety  of  individu- als, with the aspirations of art, and with the  wants of commerce.  For both reasons, it is high time to recon- sider  the  responsibilities  of  platforms.  This  should include crafting a new principle of lia- bility tailored for social media platforms, not  borrowed  whole  cloth  from  a  law  designed  for ISPs and search engines. It should include  articulating normative expectations for what  platforms  are  –  legally,  culturally,  and  ethi- cally  –  not  just  passes  for  what  they  don’t  have  to  be. The  aim  would  be  to  urge  plat- forms  to  shift  their  fundamental  approach:  from  being  nominally  impartial  conduits  that  quietly  intervene,  to  being  the  deliber- ate  architects  of  public  spaces  of  discourse,  premised on specific rules of play, that they  then obviously have the right to enforce. And  it should include a new standard of transpar- ency and accountability for how they do so:  more  information  about  the  inner  workings  of  the  moderation  process,  more  data  pro- vided  about  who  flags  and  how  those  com- plaints  are  adjudicated,  more  transparency  about  the  labor  forces  involved,  and  more  public accountability about how and why the  rules are made.  Notes   1    It  is  visible  not  only  in  the  regulation  of  illicit  content,  but  in  legal  efforts  to  protect  user  pri- vacy,  and  in  digital  copyright  law.  Much  of  the  way we think of intermediaries as protected legal  entities was forged in the ‘copyright wars’ of the  2000s  Yu, 2003 . This chapter will focus on the  regulation  of  illicit  content,  though  many  of    the   tensions  involved  are  relevant  for  ongoing  concerns about copyright and privacy.   2   This  was  fueled  by  a  vocal  and  urgent  panic,  in  American  culture,  about  the  availability  of  por- nography  online,  a  concern  not  unwarranted  but wildly overstated  Maddison, 2010; Marwick,  2008 . Copyright infringement lawsuits began to  appear  Ginsburg, 1995 , but they were more con- cerned with images and private documents than  music and movies, which would emerge as a prob- lem later with the rise of peer-to-peer file sharing  services like Napster  Litman, 2001; Yu, 2003 .   3   Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S.    4    844  1997 . It  is  worth  noting  that  Section  230  was  for  ‘offensive material’ and explicitly excluded ‘cases  involving  federal  criminal  law,  intellectual  prop- erty law, and electronic-communications privacy  law.’  So  the  safe  harbor  it  establishes  for  ISPs  and platforms does not apply to these other con- cerns. This explains why the platform obligations  for child pornography are very different than for  other categories of harmful speech, because child  pornography is a federal, criminal offense. It also  explains why the arrangements are different for  copyright  infringement.  The  Digital  Millennium  Copyright Act, also passed in 1996, offered ISPs  and  search  engines  protection  against  a  charge  of contributing to copyright infringement as well,  but this safe harbor comes with some obligations,  the most notable being that intermediaries must  comply  with  ‘notice  and  takedown’  requests  from copyright owners who have identified their  work  as  being  circulated  through  their  service   Fifer and Carter, 2004 . In court cases that fol- lowed,  peer-to-peer  networks  and  other  online  services found they did not enjoy the DMCA safe  harbor  when  they  had  ‘materially’  contributed  to the circulation of pirated content, when they  enjoyed  some  financial  benefit  from  it,  or  even  when  they  had  ‘induced’  it  by  promoting  their  service as designed for piracy.   5   This is before innovations such as digital finger- printing  and  other  forms  of  automated  content  identification, techniques that now make it pos- sible  for  platforms  and  ISPs  to  ‘know’  of  illicit  content on their service, even in real time.   6   Branigan, T.  2010 .

The  conceptual  frame  that  gives  direction  to  this  examination  is  that  of  the  political  economy  of  communication  –  an  established and well-tested approach  Wasko,  2004;  Mosco,  1996   that  has  been  applied  not  only  to  the  analysis  of  regulated  broad- cast media industries but also to the study of  search  Van Couvering, 2011; Mosco, 2014 ,  mobile   Goldsmith,  2014 ,  locative   Wilken  and Bayliss, 2015 , and social media indus- tries   Albarran,  2013 ,  as  well  as  to  new  forms of media consumption and distribution   Lobato and Thomas, 2015 . This framework  is  productive  for  understanding  higher-level  transformations,  financing  arrangements,  business  models  and  other  vested  interests,  and  the  political  and  social  impacts  of  the  media  industries.  When  applied  to  social  media  app  markets,  a  political  economy  approach directs our attention to the different   stakeholders  involved  with  controlling  and  commercialising  applications  for  mobile  devices  and,  increasingly,  the  data  that  are  generated in and through them. Who controls  and  benefits  from  commercial  app  develop- ment? How have Apple and Google managed  to effectively create an app market? What are  the financial arrangements, business models,  and  cross-platform  and  other  data-sharing  deals that make social media apps so lucra- tive and their end-user data so sought after?  Beginning with an overview of the mobile  smartphone app economy and its two indus- try  leaders,  Apple  and  Google,  the  chapter  shifts focus to social media applications and  the  revenue  generation  efforts  of  two  large,  US-domiciled  firms:  Facebook  and  Twitter.  The  second  part  of  the  chapter  then  argues  for  the  importance  of  looking  beyond  the  established  US  market  to  develop  a  fuller  account  of  global  social  media  app  econo- mies;  specific  attention  is  given  to  two  of  the larger BRICS nations, China and Russia.  The chapter closes with consideration given    280  to  the  importance  of  examining  the  interre- lationships  between  firms   and  their  financ- ing  if we are to develop a detailed account  of the intricate structures of, and interconnec- tions between, social media app markets and  economies.  The app economy  Ben Goldsmith  2014: 171  explains that ‘the  first common use of “app” as shorthand for  “software  application”  was  in  1985,  when  Apple  released  the  MacApp  programming  tool’. It was not until the launch of Apple’s  App Store in mid-2008, which Cheng  2012:  49   views  as  a  revolutionary  step  in  the  ‘development of a new type of market econ- omy’, that ‘“app” became commonly under- stood to refer principally to software designed  to  run  on  mobile  platforms  and  devices’   Goldsmith,  2014:  171 .  As  for  the  phrase  ‘app  economy’,  Goldsmith   2014:  171   points out that its usage emerged as a way to  describe  ‘the  impressive  revenues  being  earned, principally in the games sector, from  sales  of  apps,  in-app  purchases,  and  in-app  advertising either on Facebook, or via an app  store’. A good example of such extraordinary  app-based  revenue  generation  in  the  games  sector  is  Angry  Birds,  with  the  company  behind  it,  Rovio,  investing  US$140,000  in  initial development of the game for a profit  of US$70 million  Cheng, 2012: 52 . A cru- cial factor in understanding the app economy  is recognising, as Michael Mandel points out,  that it is in reality ‘a collection of interlock- ing  innovative  ecosystems’,  and  that  at  the  heart of each ecosystem are three things: ‘a  core company, which creates and maintains a  platform, and an app marketplace, plus small  and large companies that produce apps and  or mobile devices for that platform’  Mandel,  quoted in Goldsmith, 2014: 171 .  At present, there are two ‘core’ companies  that  control  the  platforms  and  app  market- places at the heart of the larger mobile social   media  app  ecosystem:  Apple,  with  its  iOS  platform and App Store; and Google, with its  Android platform and Google Play app store.  Traffic  to  each  is  driven,  of  course,  by  the  astonishing growth of iOS and Android pow- ered smartphones since the early 2000s. While  accurate  app  store  metrics  are  notoriously  difficult  to  obtain,  mobile  industry  analyst  Benedict Evans argues that a close examina- tion  of  the  reporting  offered  by  Apple  and  Google  at  their  respective  annual  developer  conferences  does  provide  an  overall  picture  of what is going on, although clear compari- sons between the two app stores remain dif- ficult  to  draw.1  Looking  at  2014  developer  event  data  for  both  companies,  Evans  notes  that, ‘both Apple and Google gave numbers  for the money they had paid to developers in  their respective app stores: $5bn in the pre- vious 12 months for Google Play and $10bn  for the iOS App Store’. In interpreting these  figures, Evans  2015  concludes that, ‘given  Android has double the user base of iOS, this  meant  that  the  average  iOS  user  was  worth  around  4x  the  average Android  user  in  app  store revenue’. For Evans  2015 , these pay- ments also imply that, ‘since Google Android  has close to double the number of users’, the  ‘average  user  is  spending  perhaps  half  as  much  as  the  average  iOS  user’.  While  this  constitutes a change from the previous finan- cial  quarter,  it  is  nonetheless  still  regarded  as  ‘a  big  gap’.  Subsequent  interim  figures  released during 2015 by Google suggesting a  slight increase in payments to developers, and  Apple  announcing  an  unchanged  payment  total in 2015 from the previous year, point to  Google  Play  growing  faster  than  and  likely  to overtake iOS  Evans, 2015 . This statistic,  alongside  moves  by Apple  and  competitors  such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat ‘to  incorporate  professional  content  […]  more  deeply into their apps and services’, may pro- vide a clue as to why Apple was reported in  mid-2015 to be contemplating ‘new commer- cial terms with media companies’ that would  potentially  ‘alter  the  70 30  “Apple  tax”’  –  whereby  a  developer  who  sells  an  app  or  a    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  281  digital good inside the app for $1 gets $0.70  of  that  sale  and  Apple  takes  $0.30  –  that  was pioneered by the late founder of Apple,  Steve Jobs, to accompany the launch of the  iTunes  music  store  in  2003   Bradshaw  and  Bond, 2015 . Evans also records that Google  Play had 50 billion downloads and the Apple  App  Store  had  25  billion  in  the  2014–2015  financial  year.  When  Play’s  greater  number  of users is accounted for, these figures imply  ‘roughly the same number of downloads per  user on Android and iOS’  Evans, 2015 . In  overall  terms,  ‘these  numbers  show  annual- ized  consumer  spending  on  apps  of  around  $25bn,  and  75bn  apps  downloaded’  in  the  2014–2015 financial year  Evans, 2015 .  There  is  also  every  indication  that  these  figures  will  only  continue  to  rise,  especially  beyond  the  US  market.  According  to  the  International  Telecommunication  Union’s  2015  report,  ‘there  are  more  than  7  billion  mobile  cellular  subscriptions,  corresponding  to a penetration rate of 97%, up from 738 mil- lion  in  2000’   ITU,  2015 .  More  tellingly  in  the  context  of  the  prospects  of  future  social  media  app  market  growth  is  the  fact  that,  despite  significant  pricing  discrepancies  that  favour  developed  over  developing  countries,  mobile  broadband  continues  to  be  ‘the  most  dynamic  market  segment’,  with  ‘mobile- broadband  penetration’  reaching  47%  glob- ally in 2015, ‘a value that increased 12 times  since  2007’   ITU,  2015 . And,  according  to  forecasts provided by app data analytics firm  App  Annie,  ‘the  user  base  of  smartphones  and tablets will more than double to 6.2 bil- lion by 2020’, driven by cheaper smartphones  and  more  accessible  data  plans,  with  much  of  the  growth  likely  to  come  from  India,  Indonesia, China, Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey   Viita, 2016 . This, in turn, is viewed as being  likely to drive application store revenue up to  US$101 billion within five years  Viita, 2016 . Setting aside the predicted growth of new  smartphone  app  users,  the  immediate  and  longer  term  future  of  the  global  app  econ- omy  also  depends  on  the  maintenance  of  good business relationships between the core   platform  and  app  market  companies   Apple  and Google  and mobile app developers and  other interested parties. In short, there must  be  some  tangible  benefit  in  these  arrange- ments to all parties who are involved – that  is the fundamental premise of an ecosystem,  after  all. As  Goldsmith  argues,  ‘the  restruc- turing of the mobile value chain’ that Apple  introduced with its App Store ‘hinges on the  ecosystem’s attractiveness to developers’. In  addition, there is the risk that, ‘if third-party  software applications and services cease to be  developed and maintained for the [platform  app  market  owner’s]  products,  customers  may choose not to buy the Company’s prod- ucts’  Apple 2012 Annual Report, quoted in  Goldsmith,  2014:  174 . Thus,  as  Goldsmith  points out, ‘the value of app stores for plat- form  owners  is  not  principally  the  income  they generate, but rather the opportunity they  provide  to  cultivate  and  manage  an  ecosys- tem’  2014: 175 , even if the specific reasons  for  doing  so  differ  from  platform  owner  to  platform  owner   Pon,  Seppälä,  and  Kenney,  2014 . And yet,  while it may be true that app stores ‘are ecosystem  control  points,  rather  than  revenue  sources’  for  platform  owners,  as  the  number  of  paid-app  downloads  and  in-app  purchases  increase,  and  despite  the  fact  that  most  apps  are  downloaded  for free, app stores are generating significant rev- enue  for  operators  and  for   some   developers.   Goldsmith, 2014: 175   The ‘some’ that Goldsmith places in paren- theses  appears  to  be  the  operative  word,  as  the app economy is by no means a level play- ing  field.  A  2014  VisionMobile  study  of  developer  economics  collated  responses  from over 10,000 developers from 137 coun- tries.  Dividing  app  developers  into  the  ‘haves’,  the  ‘poverty- stricken’, and the ‘have-nothings’, the study  found that 50% of iOS developers and 64%  of  Android  developers  are  operating  below  what  they  term  the  ‘app  poverty  line’  of  US$500  per  app  per  month   Perez,  2014b .  In  contrast,  within  the  category  of  ‘haves’,  12%  of  developers  make  more  than   the  ‘strugglers’,    282  US$10,000  per  app  per  month,  which  is  weighted  in  favour  of  iOS  developers,  2%  make between US$100,000 and US$500,000  per app per month, and 1.6% make more than  US$500,000 per app per month.  A  related  study  by  Caribou  Digital  of  the  global  distribution  and  concentration  of  the  app economy discovered that ‘95% of the esti- mated industry value is being captured by just  the top 10 producing countries’, with the USA,  Japan,  and  China  dominant,  and  that  ‘the  19  lower-income  countries  […]  earned  an  esti- mated  1%  of  global  app  economy  revenues’   Caribou  Digital,  2016 .  Indeed,  such  is  the  level of concentration of app revenue genera- tion that ‘a small handful of firms earn so much  that they outperform most of the countries’ in  the study, with the authors noting that Finnish  game development company Supercell earned  more than 28 of the countries in their sample,  combined  Caribou Digital, 2016 .  This uneven distribution of app revenue is  associated with certain ‘geographies of exclu- sion’, to borrow David Sibley’s  1995  term,  that are not just a result of where a developer  might live, but also of regional and national  ‘market-based  factors’   e.g.,  that  ‘consum- ers in every market showed a preference for  apps  developed  by  local  producers’   and  of  ‘platform-based  factors’   Caribou  Digital,  2016 . Of the latter category, two such factors  are worth noting here. The first concerns plat- form access restrictions. The report’s authors  point out that ‘Google only allows developers  in  certain  countries  to  monetize  their  prod- ucts through the Google Play app store’:  Developers  who  want  to  earn  revenue  from  Android  apps  on  the  Google  Play  app  store  are  required  to  set  up  a  merchant  account,  which  is  what  links  their  bank  account  to  Google  so  that  they  can  receive  funds  from  the  app  store.  However, Google merchant accounts are not avail- able  in  74  countries,  with  half  of  sub-Saharan  Africa  and  much  of  Latin  America  excluded.   Caribou Digital, 2016   The  second  platform-based  factor  ‘is  the  structuring  of  the  app  stores  into  discrete  national  stores’   Caribou  Digital,  2016 .   While this holds many compliance and other  regulatory benefits for Apple and Google – it  ‘allows the platform to adhere to different tax  laws,  content  regulations,  and  copyright  licensing for music and other media’  Caribou  Digital,  2016   –  it  carries  other  significant  implications as well: it can lead to the exclu- sion  of  certain  applications   as  a  result  of  local laws and cultural and political sensitivi- ties ; it can reinforce ‘home field advantage’;  contribute  to  a  decrease  in  developer  diver- sity and representation within app stores; and  lead to a further concentration of revenues in  the hands of only a few developers.  In  the  midst  of  this  discussion  of  app  developer  revenues,  one  should  not  lose  sight  of  who  the  major  financial  beneficiar- ies of the app economy actually are: the app  marketplace  owners  themselves.  In  Apple’s  case,  it  recorded  first  quarter  2016  revenue  of  US$75.9  billion   up  from  $51.5  billion  the previous quarter . In the same reporting  period, Apple’s install base  i.e., devices that  have been used to interact with Apple’s ser- vices  within  a  90-day  period ,  which  totals  1 billion, generated services revenue  which  includes  the  App  Store  and  iCloud,  among  others  of US$8.9 billion  Apple, 2016 .2 In  Google’s  case,  at  the  2015  fiscal  year  end   first quarter 2016 figures were not released  at time of writing  it earned US$74.5 billion  in  revenue  for  parent  company  Alphabet,  with  US$34.8  billion  of  this  coming  from  the  USA,  US$7.1  billion  from  the  UK,  and  US$33.1  billion  from  the  rest  of  the  world   USS&EC,  2015 . Alphabet  has  since  over- taken  Apple  as  the  world’s  most  valuable  company.  social media revenue models  Having  provided  this  overview  of  the  app  economy,  I  want  to  sharpen  the  focus  on  social  media  apps  by  exploring  briefly  the  revenue models and earnings of two globally  dominant, publicly listed social media firms:    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  283  Facebook and Twitter. In an oft-quoted adage  generally  attributed  to  Silicon Valley  entre- preneur  Steve  Blank   2010 ,  a  start-up  is  defined as ‘an organization formed to search  for a repeatable and scalable business model’.  This  is  an  apt  characterisation  of  the  social  media-focused  technology  firms  that  were  launched – post the ‘dot.com’ crash – in the  2000s, such as Facebook and Twitter. These  firms  were  born  into  what  writer  Michael  Lewis   2001   would  term  a  post-Netscape  era  of  fluid  business  models,  where  tech  start-ups  are  backed  by  venture  capital  and  other forms of investment, while developers  and investors go about figuring out how best  to  monetise  their  assets   see  also  Lacy,  2009 .  As these firms mature, however, the menu  of available revenue generation options tends  to be increasingly restricted. For social media  firms, as José van Dijck notes, these options  generally involve the fostering of data gener- ation by users  ‘data generation has become  the primary object rather than a by-product of  online sociality’ , and the subsequent utilisa- tion of this data to ‘influence traffic and mon- etize engineered streams of information’  van  Dijck, 2013: 12 . While the subtle differences  in  how  each  platform  sets  about  extracting  and  monetising  data  are  important  consid- erations  Barreneche and Wilken, 2015 , for  Jiyoung Cha  2013  there are limited means  by which revenue can be generated from end- user  data,  with  each  option  tied  to  the  core  competencies of each firm. In the two cases  explored here, these companies have matured  to the extent that they are now both publicly  listed,  and,  in  terms  of  revenue  generation,  the  strategies  of  both  Facebook  and Twitter  have  become  somewhat  more  settled,  but  are far from stable, especially in the case of  Twitter.  Facebook  In  Facebook’s  case,  Cha   2013:  71   argues,  its  include   three  sources  of   revenue   advertising,  commerce,  and  syndication.  Given  that  Facebook’s  ‘core  competency  […] comes from its network size’  2013: 69 ,  it is not surprising that advertising is the pri- mary revenue source – the greater the market  reach,  the  more  desirable  the  platform  becomes  to  advertisers,  and  the  higher  the  advertising rates that can be imposed by the  platform  owners.  Commerce  in  this  context  principally refers to within-platform transac- tions using Facebook Credits, while syndica- tion concerns the linking of Facebook users’  publicly  available  status  updates  with  other  search results  Cha, 2013: 72 . Built around  the  company’s  ‘three  pillars’   newsfeed,  timeline, and graph search  – and to which, I  have  argued  elsewhere,  we  should  add  a  fourth:  geocoded  data   Wilken,  2014   –  Facebook  has  grown  to  become  a  highly  lucrative  social  media  business.  Based  on  2015  year-end  figures,  Facebook  has  1.04  billion  daily  active  users  –  934  million  of  who are mobile daily active users  which is  an increase of 13.2% from the previous quar- ter, and is attributed to take-up in emerging  global  markets   2016 .  Facebook’s  reported  revenue  for  2015  was  US$17.93  billion,  which  represents  ‘an  increase of 44% year-over-year’, for a profit  of US$3.69 billion  Facebook, 2016 . Mobile  advertising  accounts  for  80%,  or  US$5.63  billion,  of  Facebook’s  overall  advertising  revenue. Also noteworthy here is that a size- able  portion  of  Facebook’s  ad  revenue  is  derived  the  Facebook  Audience  Network, which ‘uses its data to target ads in  other  apps’   Constine,  2016a .  Combined,  this  confirms  Facebook  as  a  major  mobile  advertising  player  and  a  significant  chal- lenger to the incumbent and long-established  leader  in  online  and  mobile  advertising,  Google.   Facebook,   from   And,  finally,  to  understand  the  scale  of  Facebook’s  corporate  operations,  and  rev- enue potential this represents, it is also worth  noting  here  the  usage  figures  relating  to  its  various  services,  including  its  subsidiar- ies.  While  Facebook  reported  1.59  billion    284  monthly  active  users,  its  other  services  are  not  far  behind:  WhatsApp  has  900  million,  Messenger  800  million,  and  Instagram  400  million.  Of  these,  WhatsApp  is  interesting  insofar as ‘it doesn’t make any money’  Statt,  2016 .  Facebook  has  dropped  subscription  fees,  and  made  a  commitment  to  keeping  it  ad free  the most obvious path towards mon- etisation .  Instead,  the  longer-term  plan  is  to  turn  it  into  ‘a  tool  businesses  can  use  to  communicate  with  customers’   Zuckerberg,  quoted in Statt, 2016 .  Twitter  In  Twitter’s  case,  Cha   2013:  73   suggests  there are two key sources of revenue: adver- tising and syndication. Twitter’s ad revenue,  Cha   2013:  73   writes,  is  based  on  three  forms of ad delivery: promoted tweets, pro- moted  accounts,  and  promoted  trends.  The  cost of the first two is calculated on a cost- per-engagement  basis,  while  the  last  is  charged as a flat daily rate  Cha, 2013: 73 .  In the fourth quarter of 2015, Twitter earned  US$641 million in revenue from these three  forms  of  advertising  combined   Twitter,  2015 .  The  second  source  of  revenue  Cha  mentions  is  syndication,  whereby  Twitter  makes  deals  with  search  engine  services   Google,  Bing, Yahoo   to  allow  the  integra- tion of tweets with other search results. The  deals  struck  with  Google  and  Microsoft  in  2009,  for  example,  were  said  to  be  worth  US$25  million  for  Twitter   Ante,  2009 .  Furthermore, in its 2011 renegotiations of its  licensing  arrangements  with  Microsoft,  Twitter  was  reportedly  seeking  ‘about  [US]$30  million  per  year  for  its  exhaustive  real-time stream, a doubling of the previous  fee,’ as well as ‘more user interface control,  a larger cut of ads sold next to its tweets [on  Bing]  and  more  linking  back  to  Twitter’   Gannes,  2011 .  While  these  figures  are  unconfirmed,  and  already  somewhat  dated,  they  are  nevertheless  indicative  of  the  high  commercial value that is placed on real-time   social media data for search and other more  traditional media companies  Cha, 2013: 74 . Cha’s  account,  however,  neglects  a  third  key source of Twitter revenue: monies earned  through data licensing and analytics, includ- ing  through  social  media  API  aggregation  company  Gnip,  which  Twitter  acquired  for  US$134.1  million  in April  2014. According  to Twitter’s  fourth  quarter  2015  figures,  the  company  earned  a  healthy  US$70  million  from  within  its  ‘Data  Licensing  &  Other’  category   Twitter,  2015 .  As  analysts  have  pointed out, it is important not to view these  revenue  streams  and  the  technologies  that  facilitate  each  as  unrelated;  in  the  words  of  one commentator, ‘analytics are essential to  good advertising, and the data-licensing busi- ness is what’s happening behind the scenes to  create  a  strong  advertising  platform’   Neal,  2013 .  In  overall  revenue  generation  terms,  however, the prospects for Twitter are look- ing somewhat less than rosy. While ‘revenue  was  up  48%  year-over-year’  in  early  2016   Lynley  and  Constine,  2016 ,  the  company  has  not  met  industry  earnings  expectations,  its stock has dropped nearly 70% in the past  12  months   fourth  quarter   Q4   2014  to  Q4  2015 , and, despite revenue of US$710 mil- lion, it has also recorded a net loss of US$90  million for fourth quarter 2015 earnings.  According   to  Goldman  Sachs’  Chief  Operating Officer and President Gary Cohn,  historically, in Silicon Valley, ‘the mantra has  been “grow at any cost – get bigger, get big- ger, get bigger”’  quoted in Crowe, 2016 . A  key expectation for social media start-ups has  been  to  grow  user  numbers  year-on-year  in  the short-to-medium term, if not revenue and  profit. The difficulty facing Twitter is that its  new  user  growth  has  not  only  been  ‘flatlin- ing’, it has, in fact, also been shrinking  due  to the loss of existing users, or ‘churn’ . This  is  especially  evident  if  you  exclude  SMS- related user statistics – a point that requires  some  explanation.  In  Twitter’s  first  quarter  2015  earnings  documents,  it  was  noted  that  the  company  had  begun  to  include  what  they  termed  ‘SMS  Fast  Followers’  among    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  285  their  monthly  average  users   MAUs   statis- tics   Twitter  does  not  provide  daily  average  user  statistics,  as  Facebook  does .  ‘SMS  Fast  Followers’  are  users  who  ‘access  and  use  Twitter  exclusively  through  text  mes- sages’, an access technique that is primarily  employed in emerging markets like India and  Brazil.  Twitter’s  embrace  of  this  approach  to  user  engagement  was  in  part  a  result  of  their  purchase  in  January  2015  of  ZipDial,  an Indian start-up whose focus was on mar- keting via text message  Purnell, 2015 . Also  known  as  ‘missed  call  marketing’,  it  works  as follows:  ZipDial  allows  consumers  to  dial  a  number  for  a  company  and  hang  up  before  connecting.  The  company then sends the caller a free text message  containing advertisements and other information,  without the users getting a charge.  Koh, 2015   The idea for Twitter users in emerging mar- kets  such  as  India  is  that  they  can  ‘place  a  missed  call  to  a  Twitter  account  [and  then]  receive tweets on their mobile device’. This  is  viewed  as  having  significant  potential  around  large  events,  such  as  international  cricket tournaments  Koh, 2015 .  For analysts, the inclusion of these figures  in Twitter’s earnings reports has been viewed  as an attempt by Twitter to ‘goose its num- bers’   Truong,  2015 .  By  including  these  ‘SMS Fast Followers’ numbers in its MAUs  within its first quarter 2015 earnings report,  Twitter  would  ‘suddenly  have  6.4  million  users’  Truong, 2015 , a significant increase  on  what  the  figure  would  otherwise  be.  To  return  to  fourth  quarter  earnings  for  2015,  ‘Twitter’s total user count is stuck at 320 mil- lion  with  zero  growth  this  quarter’,  and,  as  TechCrunch’s  Josh  Constine   2016b   points   out,  if  you  exclude  ‘SMS  Fast  Followers’,  Twitter’s  ‘monthly  user  count  went  down  from 307 million to 305 million in Q4’  see  also, Smith and Popper, 2016 . The difficulty  for Twitter is that the path towards drawing  revenue from these SMS users is long, slow,  and difficult, even more so when set against  Facebook’s  clear  revenue  growth  in  these  same  emerging  markets.  The  silver  lining  for Twitter, it would seem, in what analysts  otherwise view as a pretty gloomy Q4 2015  earnings report, is that Twitter’s average rev- enue  per  monthly  average  user   ARPMAU   is considered to be quite strong, even when  viewed  against  Facebook’s  ARPMAU   see  Table 15.1 .  Despite  this  financial  silver  lining,  and  despite its substantial existing user base, the  harsh  financial  realities  of  the  social  media  app economy mean that Twitter is faced with  the  prospect  of  having  to  either  figure  out  how to foster significant new user growth, or  convince investors that ongoing year-on-year  growth is not a prerequisite for success and  that it does not have to be the next Facebook  in  order  to  carve  out  a  viable  market  niche   albeit perhaps at a reduced market valuation .  Under present circumstances, there is signifi- cant  pressure  on  Silicon Valley  start-ups  to  achieve year-on-year new user growth if they  are to attain, maintain, and further grow high  market  valuations.  When  new  user  growth  shows  signs  of  slowing,  there  is  a  strong  temptation to tinker with platform design and  core  functionalities  in  an   often  misguided   attempt  to  recapture  user  enthusiasm  and  attract  new  users,  or,  if  this  is  not  possible,  to open up new revenue streams. This is pre- cisely  the  path  that Twitter  has  gone  down,  several times over. A viable, if somewhat less   Table 15.1  comparison of facebook and Twitter average revenue per monthly average user   arpmau   amounts in us$   MAU  Revenue  ARPMAU  Market Cap  $B  as of  February 10, 2016  Facebook Twitter  1,590,000,000 320,000,000  $5,841,000,000 $710,000,000  $3.67 $2.22  $286.90 $9.90   286  attractive,  alternative  business  strategy  is  to  perhaps  accept  a  reduced  market  valuation  and  concentrate  efforts  around  retaining  the  core of the platform’s present design success  and a financially sustainable business model  that seeks to keep running costs low, and user  number and revenue streams steady.  brics and beyond  In  focusing  on  the  aforementioned  large- scale, US-domiciled social network services,  despite their undisputed global reach, there is  a  still  a  risk  that  we  become  blinkered  to  other  key  global  concentrations  of  social  media  activity3  and  other  significant  social  media  corporate  players.  Indeed,  given  the  global  reach  of  and  fascination  with  social  media,  Gerard  Goggin’s  and  Mark  McLelland’s  2009  call that internet, social  media,  and  mobile  research  move  beyond  ‘Anglophone  paradigms’  remains  as  urgent  as ever.  A  useful  starting  point  in  broadening  understanding of the global social media app  economy is by accounting for the  composi- tion  of  the  app  economy  within  the  BRICS   Brazil,  Russia,  India,  China,  and  South  Africa   group  of  nations.  For  a  number  of  BRICS  nations  –  specifically  Brazil,  India,  and  South Africa  –  the  tale,  on  the  surface  at  least,  is  an  increasingly  familiar  one  of  Facebook  entering  and  rapidly  gaining  suf- ficient  traction  to  become  the  dominant  social  media  service.  This  gloss,  however,  obscures  a  number  of  other  potentially  pro- ductive narrative trajectories that, if pursued,  would  likely  draw  out  particularly  striking  features  of,  and  issues  pertaining  to,  each  of  these  specific  markets.  In  Brazil  there  is  a potentially very interesting story to be told  around the gradual demise of Google’s Orkut  and its supersession by Facebook, and failure  in a Latourian sense, whereby a technology  can be understood as failing not necessarily  because  any  particular  actor  brought  about   its demise, but because actors failed to sus- tain the technology through negotiation and  adaptation  to  changing  social   and,  I  would  add, political economic  conditions  Latour,  1996 .  In  India,  there  is  the  rich  and  fasci- nating  tale  concerning  net  neutrality  and  local  entrepreneurial  as  well  as  regulatory  resistance to Facebook’s controversial ‘Free  Basics’ programme  Ghoshal, 2016; see also  Vaidhyanathan, Chapter 12 this volume , as  well  as  the  ensuing  Twitter  firestorm  that  erupted when prominent Silicon Valley ven- ture capitalist and investor in Facebook, Marc  Andreessen, expressed his displeasure at the  failure of this programme, and the suggestion  that Facebook represents a neo-colonial force  in  India,  by  tweeting  that  ‘anti-colonialism  has been economically catastrophic for India  for decades’  Wadhwa, 2016 . And, in South  Africa,  as  elsewhere  in  the  region,  there  is  a quite different but equally fascinating tale  to  be  told  around  infrastructural  challenges,  cultures  of  making  do,  and  the  complicated  means by which platforms like Facebook and  the locally-significant affordable instant mes- saging  service  MXit  overlap  and  intersect   Walton, 2014 . In the space available, how- ever, I wish to touch on the cases of the two  remaining BRICS nations: China and Russia.  China  The  main  Silicon  Valley  social  media  and  search  companies  –  Facebook,  Twitter,  Google – have by-and-large failed to gain a  significant  foothold  in  China.  This  should  perhaps  have  come  as  no  real  surprise  to  those familiar with the mixed fortunes faced  by other US-based companies attempting to  enter  the  Chinese  market.  The  trials  and  tribulations of advertising agencies in main- land  China,  for  instance,  have  been  well  documented   see,  for  example,  Sinclair,  2008 .  Rather,  what  has  emerged  in  China  since  2009  is  a  very  concentrated  social  media market, dominated by three very big  corporate players, Tencent Holdings, Weibo    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  287  Corporation,  and  Alibaba  Group.  In  this  analysis, I draw on a range of financial data:  half-year 2015 figures in the case of Tencent,  and second quarter  Q2  2015 figures in the  case of Weibo; at the time of writing, neither  company  had  released  full-year  2015  fig- ures,  which  makes  comparisons  between  them, and with Facebook and Twitter, diffi- cult to draw.  Of  the  three  big  Chinese  companies,  Tencent  is  the  largest.  It  has  a  2015  mar- ket  value  exceeding  US$200  billion  and  it  is now the largest internet company in Asia   after  Alibaba  suffered  a  significant  slump  in its share value . Tencent Holdings, which  is  publicly  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  stock  exchange, controls the instant messenger ser- vices QQ and WeChat  known as Weixin in  China , and the social media service QZone,  plus  a  range  of  other  QQ-badged  services.  According to its interim 2015 figures, Tencent  generated RMB48.8 billion  US$7.4 billion   in revenue, with a gross profit of RMB27.8  billion   US$4.2  billion .  As  at  30  June   2015,  QQ’s  monthly  average  users  were   843.4  million   627  million  of  whom   were  accessing  the  service  from  a  smart  device ,  WeChat’s  were  600  million,  and  Qzone’s  were  659.2  million   573.5  million  of whom accessed the service from a smart  device .  Unlike  other  social  media  compa- nies, Tencent also reports the number of peak  concurrent users of QQ  the highest number  of  people  using  the  service  within  a  prede- fined  period  of  time ,  which  for  Q2  2015  was 233 million. And, in addition to chat and  social services, a key component of Tencent’s  revenue generation operations is online gaming,  the result of which is that Tencent also lists its  fee-based value-added services  VAS  regis- tered subscriptions, which were 84.3 million  as at 30 June 2015  Tencent, 2015 .  In  terms  of  revenue  generation,  to  per- sist  with  Cha’s   2013   categories,  Tencent  earns  the  lion’s  share  of  its  revenue  not  from e-commerce, but from fee-based VAS- registered   gaming  and  social  networks  related   subscriptions,  and,  increasingly   rapidly,  from  advertising.  With  respect  to  the  former,  online  games  revenues  grew  by  17%  and  social  networks  revenues  grew  by  18%, while ad revenue grew from an initially  low  base,  with  online  advertising  revenues  increasing  by  97%,  brand  advertising  reve- nues by 47%  ‘reflecting higher contributions  from  video  advertising’ ,  and  performance- based  advertising  by  196%   ‘primarily  due  to  performance-based  social  advertising  on  mobile devices’   Tencent, 2015 . All of this,  however,  is  not  to  underestimate  the  very  real  significance  of  commerce  to  Tencent:  WeChat, for instance, is said to have recorded  more  mobile  e-commerce  transactions  over  the 2016 Chinese New Year than PayPal did  during the whole of 2015  McEleny, 2016 .  Finally,  a  striking  feature  of  Tencent’s  earnings  is  the  concentration  within  China   ‘Revenues  derived  from  external  custom- ers in Mainland China for the three and six  months  ended  30  June  2015  were  RMB21,  590  million  …  and  revenues  derived  from  external  customers  in  other  regions  were  RMB1,839 million’  Tencent, 2015  . Given  the take-up within China, this makes for very  high active user and revenue figures, but also  reveals that Tencent at present lacks the reach  of other services, like Facebook. While there  are  clear  growth  opportunities  for  Tencent  within a sizeable Chinese diaspora, it remains  to be seen how successful the company will be  at attracting a wider, international user base.  The second of the three firms is the long- running  Chinese  social  media  service,  Sina  Weibo,  which  is  owned  by  parent  com- pany  Weibo  Corporation.  Listed  on  the  US  NASDAQ  stock  exchange,  Weibo  recorded  strengthened  usage  numbers  and  financial  results by the halfway mark of 2015. Weibo’s  monthly active users  MAUs  were 212 million  for June 2015, an increase of 36% year-over- year; 85% of these 212 million were mobile  monthly  active  users   Weibo,  2015 . Weibo  also recorded daily average users of 93 million   for  June  2015,  an  averaged  figure  that,  needless  to  say,  is  substantially  less  than   its  MAUs  figure   Weibo,  2015 .  For  the    288  second quarter  Q2  of 2015, Weibo recorded  net revenues of $US107.8 million, a reported  increase  of  39%  year-over-year   Weibo,  2015 .  Like  Tencent,  Weibo  earns  the  bulk  of  its  revenue  from  advertising   US$87.9  million,  which  represents  an  increase  of  37% year-over-year , and from Weibo Value  Added  Services   VAS    US$20  million,  a  more  modest  increase  of  13%  year-over- year   Weibo, 2015 . These revenue increases  are described in Weibo’s financial reporting  as the result of increased efforts to build their  presence in ‘lower tiered cities’ in Mainland  China,  expanded  partnerships  ‘with  the  tel- evision and movie industries’  Weibo, 2015 ,  and elsewhere as the result of more aggres- sive longer-term efforts to push ‘in-stream or  news feed advertising’, which was enabled, in  part, through a strategic deal with Alibaba’s  Taobao e-commerce platform  Cutler, 2013 .  However, as The Wall Street Journal reports,  these results are also the product of a ‘critical  transformative period to revamp [its] legacy  business and diversify [its] business models’  as a result of decline in ‘portal revenue’, and  due to the threat posed by its rivals Tencent  and Alibaba   Beckerman,  2015 . While,  for  its investors, the financial results for the quar- ter ended June 2015 are encouraging, it is too  early  to  tell  what  longer-term  implications  this  ‘revamp’  will  have  for  Weibo’s  social  media  business  operations  and  corporate  prospects.  Finally,  in  the  case  of  Alibaba  Group,  despite dominating Chinese market share in  the e-commerce sector, social media has been  a particularly difficult nut for it to crack. Back  in  2009,  for  instance,  Alibaba  attempted  –  albeit largely unsuccessfully – to graft social  network  functionality  onto  its  e-commerce  platform Taobao by creating a SNS subsidi- ary known as Taojianghu  Fletcher, 2009 . In  2015, it tried to do so once again by launch- ing DingTalk, a ‘collaboration and messaging  app  for  small-to-medium  businesses’   Shu,  2015 .  However,  its  most  significant  moves  towards  building  a  social  media  presence  are  clearly  its  substantial  US$586  million   investment in Sina Weibo  Custer, 2013 , its  US$215  million  investment  the  following  year  in  social  messaging  app Tango   Perez,  2014a , and its $US200 million investment in  2015 in Snapchat  Russell, 2015 .  Russia  Turning  from  China  to  Russia,  while  Facebook  dominates  the  social  media  land- scape in many parts of the world, in Russia   and  neighbouring  countries ,  as  in  China,  this  does  not  hold  true   Blinova,  2013 .  In  Russia – as well as the Ukraine, Belarus, and  Kazakhstan  –  Vkontakte   or  VK.com   remains  the  most  popular  social  media  ser- vice  ahead  of  Odnoklassniki,  My  World@ Mail.ru, and Facebook; it is also the second  most  visited  website  behind  Yandex,  the  Russian  search  engine   Baran  and  Stock,  2015 . Vkontakte  Russian for ‘in touch’, or  ‘keeping  contact’   was  founded  in  2006  by  Pavel Durov, who was controversially ousted  from the company in 2015  Johnston, 2015 .  Vkontakte has a reported 67 million monthly  active users.  Mail.ru  Group,  which  is  listed  on  the  London  stock  exchange,  dominates  the  Russian  social  media  landscape.  The  hold- ing company bought a 40% stake in VK.com  in  2007,  and  then  acquired  the  remaining  shares in 2014 to become the sole owner of  the leading Russian social media firm. Mail. ru  also  controls  VK.com’s  two  key  rivals:  Odnoklassniki  and  My  World.  For  the  six  months  ended  June  2015,  Mail.ru  reported  total  revenues  of  RUB18  billion   US$248  million .  In  its  reporting,  Mail.ru  divides  revenues  into  five  broad  categories,  with  the RUB18 billion broken down as follows:  ‘Email, Portal, and IM [Instant Messaging]’   RUB1.9 billion ; ‘Social Networks  ex VK ’   RUB6.8 billion ; ‘Online Games’  RUB4.1  billion ;   RUB2.6  billion ;  and  ‘Ecommerce, Search & other’  RUB2.5 bil- lion   Mail.ru, 2015 . What is striking about  these figures is that, while VK.com remains   ‘VK’    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  289  the  most  popular  social  media  service  in  Russia, it is by no means the most lucrative.  One explanation for this is that VK.com earns  revenues  from  app  developer  commissions  and advertising, while Mail.ru’s other social  network  businesses   Odnoklassniki  and  My  World  from the quite lucrative e-commerce  stream   in  the  form  of  user  payments  for  virtual gifts , as well as from app developer  commissions and advertising  Mail.ru, 2015 .  Having  provided  the  above  accounts  of  the  social  media  app  economies  of  two  key  BRICS  nations,  China  and  Russia,  I  am  reluctant  to  draw  detailed  comparisons  between them. While examinations of media  systems are sorely needed that compare ‘the  “East” with the “East”’  versus ‘the “West”  with the “Rest”’ , to use Meng and Rantanen’s   2015  terminology, any such analysis would  be difficult to achieve in the space available  here. As  Meng  and  Rantanen   2015   argue,  any  nuanced  comparative  analysis  of  these  two very complicated media markets requires  ‘historizing  comparative  media  studies   from  non-Western  perspectives’   p.  2 ,   ‘re-conceptualizing the relationship between  the  state  and  media  markets’   p.  2 ,4  and  critically  ‘rethinking  the  dynamics  between  the global, the national, and the local’  p. 8 .  Rather, in the space remaining I intend to add  further  detail  to  the  emerging  picture  of  global social media app markets and econo- mies  developed  above  by  discussing  the  vitally important role that is played by cross- platform  data-sharing  and  other  arrange- ments  in  driving  the  commercialisation  of  social media applications. What these reflec- tions  aim  to  provide  is  some  preliminary  evidence  of  an  emergent  set  of  dynamics  –  shared  by  Facebook, Tencent  and  Mail.ru  –  that  suggest  a  re-emergence  of   and  reinvigoration of the concept of  the entrepôt.  This, I suggest, is facilitated by complicated   and  difficult  to  track   cross-platform  data- sharing  agreements,  increased  global  con- centration  of  financial   cross- investment,  and  the  embrace  of  holding  company-like   corporate  structures   arrangements  that  are  fuelled  by  corporate  acquisitions  driving  greater horizontal integration of services and  data-gathering capabilities .  ‘neTWorked media’: The  faciliTaTion of inTeroperabiliTy  and daTa-sharing  In  her  book  Status  Update, Alice  Marwick   2013:  6   remarks  that,  ‘“interoperability”,  the  ability  to  port  data  from  one  site  to  another [… seems] quaint in the context of  closed  networks  like  Facebook,  proprietary  formats like the Apple App Store, and highly  regulated  environments  like  mobile  carri- ers’. My suggestion here is that, contrary to  this view, the facilitation of interoperability  remains a vital concern for, and a key aspect  of  the  economic  ambitions  of,  the  firms  which  control  social  media  applications,  regardless of whether these are ‘closed net- works’, like Facebook, or other social media  firms.  With  respect  to  ‘closed  networks’,  Mark  Andrejevic   2007:  299   points  out  that  ‘the  model  of  enclosure  highlights  the  ongoing  importance  of  structures  of  ownership  and  control over productive resources’. Elsewhere  I  have  attempted  to  draw  out  the  strategic  importance  of  this  for  Facebook,  suggest- ing  that  a  productive  way  of  thinking  about  Facebook’s  location-driven  acquisitions  of  Instagram and WhatsApp is via reference to  an  idea  taken  from  international  trade:  that  of the entrepôt  Wilken, 2014 . This is a term  that refers traditionally to ‘a place or district  which acts as an intermediary centre for trade  between foreign countries’  Moore, c. 1963:  63 . In a general – and, for my purposes, more  apposite – sense, it also involves ‘the receipt  of goods from one part of the world and their  distribution to another part; or a place where  goods  are  temporarily  stored’   c.  1963:  63 .  In  the  case  of  Facebook,  we  might  think  of  its  present  relationship  with  Instagram  and    290  WhatsApp, where these two  at least for now   enjoy  relative  independence  from  their  par- ent company, as a form of application-based  corporate  –  as  opposed  to  transnational  –  entrepôt trade. A key difference from earlier  conceptions  of  entrepôt  trade,  however,  is  that, in Facebook’s case, the ‘goods’ are gen- erated by end-users  in the forms of geotagged  status  updates,  likes,  and  so  forth ,  received  and  ‘stored’  by  entrepôt  intermediary  cen- tres   Instagram,  WhatsApp ,  before  flowing  to  the  parent  trader   Facebook   and  into  its  places database and social graph. Of course,  as with the historical development of entrepôt  trade   Smith,  1910;  Boon,  2013 ,  control  of  the  technological  infrastructure  facilitating  this flow of ‘goods’ is crucial: for the British  Empire  this  included  railway,  shipping,  and  other  distribution  technologies  and  chan- nels; whereas, in Facebook’s case, it involves  propriety  software  and  ranking  and  other  algorithmic processes  Pasquale, 2015: 66  –  especially  those  which  facilitate  the  flow  of  data  from  Instagram  and WhatsApp   among  other sources  into Facebook’s databases. The  outcome for Facebook from this data flow, to  adapt Mark Andrejevic’s  2007: 296  words,  is  a  portrait  of  ‘user  activity  made  possible  by ubiquitous interactivity’, especially social  media-based  interactivity,  that  is  ‘increas- ingly detailed and fine-grained, thanks to an  unprecedented  ability  to  capture  and  store  patterns  of  interaction,  movement,  transac- tion,  and  communication’.  Facebook  and  its  subsidiaries,  and  Mail.ru  and  its  subsidiar- ies, continue the tradition of entrepôt centres  acting  as  key  ‘intermediaries’  in  the  value  chain.  Traditionally,  this  would  have  linked  manufacturers with consumers  see Feenstra  and Hanson, 2004: 6–8 ; here, however, these  arrangements are disrupted  Flew, 2008: 200– 201 , such that both ends of the value chain  come to serve dual roles as both the suppliers  and the consumers of rich, monetisable digital  content. For Facebook, Tencent and Mail.ru,  like for more traditional centres of trade, ‘the  income flow from these entrepôt activities is  large’  Feenstra and Hanson, 2004: 4 .  A key reason for the implementation and  absorption  by  one  platform  of  another’s  ‘strategic  interface  modifications’,  José  van  Dijck  explains   2013:  156 ,  is  that  it  is  ‘mutually  beneficial’  in  ‘driving  traffic  for  all  parties  involved’.  Clearly  the  main  beneficiaries  of  these  arrangements  are  the  larger  firms   Facebook,  Tencent,  Mail.ru .  However,  beyond  large  ‘closed  networks’  like  Facebook,  the  promotion  and  mainte- nance  of  interoperability  –  especially  given  a seemingly endless stream of app modifica- tions and updates – remains a vital concern  for  social  media  firms,  especially  smaller  firms  like Foursquare  and start-ups if they  are  to  survive  and  thrive.  Moreover,  given  the  stakes  involved,  it  is  of  little  surprise  that those who rely on interoperability ‘have  a  vested  interest  in  erasing  the  boundaries  [between one service and another] and ren- dering  its  operational  logic  invisible’   van  Dijck,  2013:  171 .  Van  Dijck   2013:  163– 164   describes  these  inter-  and  infra-firm  arrangements  as  ‘chains  of  microsystems’.  This is a productive way of framing the vari- ous  corporate  arrangements  that  shape  the  flow and monetisation of data.  There  are,  I  would  suggest,  two  crucial  further  dimensions   at  least   that  might  be  added  to  future  accounts  of  these  social  media ‘chains of microsystems’. First, what  is  not  included  by  van  Dijck   2013   in  her  account, but is becoming increasingly impor- tant  to  understanding  the  internal  logics  of  interoperability and data transfer, is focused  consideration of the  often quite low profile   companies that form the links in these chains,  the  ‘interstices  between  platforms’   2013:  156  – that is, those firms  like Button and IF   that provide infrastructural and service sup- port so as to facilitate social media platform  interoperability  and  data  flow,  and  which  form vital nodes in the larger networked app  ecosystem  and  economy.5  Second,  I  would  like to further suggest that van Dijck’s notion  of  ‘networked  media’  might  be  extended  productively by thinking through and explor- ing  the  place  of  venture  capital  investment    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  291  within,  and  other  forms  of  financial  control  of, these corporate ‘chains of microsystems’. One  of  the  things  that  emerged  most  strongly  from  the  research  undertaken  for  this  chapter  was  the  clear  and  increasing  sense  of  global  concentration  of  investment  in and ownership of social media businesses.  For example, a key if little discussed firm is  Naspers,  a  multinational  internet  and  media  group  based  in  South Africa,  with  a  market  capitalisation of over US$66 billion. Naspers  has a 34% stake in Tencent  as at 2014 , and  a  29%  stake  in  Mail.ru   as  at  2013 ,  and  a  controlling  stake  in  Russian  classifieds  site  Avito   Khrennikov  and  Spillane,  2015 .  In  addition, it is worth noting that Tencent and  Alibaba, as well as DST Global  see below ,  all  have  significant  stakes  in  Didi  Kauidi,  China’s local rival to Uber.  My final example brings us back to Mail. ru Group. Back in June 2008, Estonian firm  Forticom,  owner  of  the  Lithuanian  social  media  service  one.lt  and  quarter  owner  of  Odnoklassniki, aquired a controlling stake in  Polish social media service Nasza-Klasa for  PLN200 million  US$92 million . Two years  later, Russian firm Digital Sky Technologies,  headed  by  the  mercurial  Russian  entrepre- neur  Yuri  Milner,  took  financial  control  of  Forticom.  Digital  Sky  Techologies  was  the  operator  of  Mail.ru,  and  when  the  lat- ter service was floated on the London stock  exchange,  Mail.ru  Group  became  the  new  business  name  for  both.  As  we  have  seen  above,  Mail.ru  Group  now  owns  VK.com,  Odnoklassniki and My World, and thus con- trolling  interests  in  Europe’s  largest   non- Facebook   social  media  services.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  Digital  Sky  Technologies  made early investments in a number of now  key tech firms, including Facebook  US$200  million  in  2009 ,  Groupon,  and  Zynga.  Subsequent to the Mail.ru stock market float,  Milner  created  a  new  firm,  DST  Global,  to  handle  international  investments,  including  US$800  million  in Twitter,  US$125  million  in WhatsApp, stakes in Alibaba, Spotify, and  AirBnB,  further  investments  in  Facebook   and  Groupon,  as  well  as  financing  many  other  ventures.  These  significant  invest- ments, and the sheer financial reach of firms  such  as  Naspers  and  DST  Global,  are  little  understood and warrant careful future critical  examination.  In  addition  to  its  investment  reach,  the  Mail.ru Group is noteworthy for its holding  company structure. It is one of a number of  social media and search companies that have  undergone  corporate  consolidation  of  this  sort, most notably Alphabet Inc.; Facebook,  too, while not formally operating as a hold- ing company, increasingly has, I would sug- gest,  holding  company-like  characteristics  in the way that it manages its key subsidiary  services.  A  formal  holding  company  structure  car- ries a number of practical operational advan- tages  for  the  firms  involved   e.g.,  taxation  benefits,  a  relaxation  of  certain  forms  of  financial scrutiny, reduced risk, ‘freedom of  capital  allotment’,  and  so  forth . Additional  advantages to a holding company-like struc- ture for social media and search firms can be  grasped  by  briefly  considering  the  situation  facing the global advertising industry during  the 1990s.  Prior  to  the  arrival  of  the  big  hold- ing  groups   WPP,  Omnicom,  Interpublic,  Publicis, Dentsu, Aegis, and Havas , the two  basic functions of an ad agency – making and  placing advertisements – were generally han- dled  within  one  ‘full-service’  agency  firm.  The holding company structure, John Sinclair   2012: 39  has argued, led to an ‘unbundling’  of  these  core  services,  such  that  ‘the  busi- ness of strategically purchasing media space  and time [were] hived off from the “creative”  business of devising and executing advertis- ing  campaigns,  in  quite  separate  agencies’.  These,  alongside  PR  firms  and  specialised  digital-strategy  firms,  became  ‘integrated  under  the  one  holding  group’.  One  of  the  key  drivers  for  these  ad  industry  corporate  reconfigurations  was  so  that  one  holding  group  such as Martin Sorell’s WPP , could  hold  or compete for  multiple accounts with    292  different clients that are in direct competition  with  each  other   such  as  Colgate-Palmolive  and Proctor & Gamble  without there being  any  perceived  or  actual  conflict  of  interest.  What this enabled, in other words, was a kind  of ‘walled garden’ that encouraged clients –  multiple  clients  –  to  keep  all  their  business   ad  creation,  media  buying,  PR  work,  etc.   within the one holding company family, and  which, for that holding company, meant cap- turing  a  greater  proportion  of  clients’  over- all ad- and media-spend budgets, as well as  associated and invaluable client-related data. This is not dissimilar to what Facebook has  been doing through entrepôt trade that enables  it to maintain ownership and control over [its]  productive resources  Andrejevic, 2007: 299 .  Similarly,  in  the  case  of  Mail.ru  Group,  the  establishment of a holding company structure  has enabled it to consolidate its dominance in  a  number  of  former  Soviet  countries  –  and,  prior  to  this,  in  other  ‘semi-peripheral’  mar- kets   Toczyski,  Krejtz,  Ciemniewski,  2015   – where Facebook has struggled to gain a foot- hold, while maintaining service choice for end- users   VK.com,  Odnoklassniki,  MyWorld ,  and diversity of revenue generation.  conclusion  This  chapter  has  explored  social  media  app  markets  and  economies.  Beginning  with  an  overview of the app economy, in the first half  of the chapter I examined the revenue options  of  two  key  US-domiciled  firms,  Facebook  and Twitter. In the second part of the chapter,  I  argued  for  the  importance  of  moving  beyond these established business contexts to  take  into  account  other  key  markets.  In  making  this  argument,  I  focused  on  two  of  the BRICS nations: China and Russia. And,  in  the  final  part  of  the  chapter  I  have  sug- gested  that,  in  developing  an  account  of  social media app economies, it is also impor- tant  to  account  for  the  interrelationships  between firms  and their financing .  While analysing the economics of mobile  social apps, I have been conscious not to for- get, as van Dijck  2013: 164  reminds us, that  platforms are always fluid. Platforms change,  as  do  their  operations,  end  uses,  business  and  revenue  models,  and  their  overall  for- tunes.  Even  so,  a  crucial  stabilising  factor  is that there ‘exists a ubiquitous technology  [the  mobile  smartphone]  that  connects  […]  to a central ecosystem’  Farbman, 2016 , of  which apps are a central part. Ecosystem ‘sta- bility’ of this sort plays a crucial role in driv- ing the current take-up of social media apps,  as  well  as  the  present  high  levels  of  invest- ment in social media services. One result of  this, I have argued, is the emergence of forms  of application-based corporate – as opposed  to transnational – entrepôt trade.  Writing  just  after  the  turn  of  the  twenti- eth  century,  J.  Russell  Smith   1910   makes  the  point  that,  while  the  days  of  a  ‘world  entrepôt’  have  long  since  passed,  new  entrepôts  are  ‘springing  up  all  the  time’   Smith,  1910:  712 .  What  I  have  sought  to  argue in this chapter is that large social media  firms, such as Facebook, Tencent, and Mail. ru, all effectively operate as entrepôt centres  of  trade.  The  emergence  of  new  entrepôts,  Smith suggests, is driven by economic imper- atives, rather than by ‘legislative statutes’ or  ‘national whim’  1910: 712 . While this may  well still hold, in the case of the firms under  examination here, it is becoming increasingly  apparent that the growth of social media data  entrepôt  trade,  and  the  consolidation  of  oli- gopolistic  control  of  this  trade,  is,  within  many  national  contexts,  of  growing  interest   and concern  across a range of areas  regu- latory  policy,  economy,  national  security,  etc. . Future work that systematically traces  these  corporate  arrangements,  the  concomi- tant concentration in ownership and  cross-  financing of social media businesses, and the  economic, policy, national security and other  discourses  that  emerge  in  response  to,  and  which  circulate  around,  these  developments  is imperative, and will add additional, impor- tant  layers  to  future  critical  understanding    soCial Media aPP eConoMies  293  of  ‘networked  media’  and  the  complicated  ‘chains of microsystems’ that structure their  operations and interoperations.

Many  would  wonder,  aren’t  social  media  purely  about  entertainment  and  leisure  activities?  Aren’t we told that social media are all about  fun  and  consumption  and  therefore  act  as  a  drain  on  productivity  for  employees,  whose  clicks and updates lead to endless procrasti- nation? How on earth do they have anything  to do with labor?  This lack of awareness should come as no  surprise  because  modern  media  representa- tions  and  discourse,  as  part  and  parcel  of  global  capitalism,  have  for  decades  system- atically  suppressed,  concealed,  and  twisted  issues  of  labor   Mosco,  2011 .  As  a  result,  members  of  the  working  class  often  orient  themselves  to  individualism  and  consumer- ism,  ignoring  their  collective  interests  and  struggle.  The  sidelining  of  labor  coverage   and  labor  perspectives  is  common  in  media  and communication research, where ‘the rela- tionship of labor and working people to mass  media and information technologies is at best  a  peripheral  item’   Mosco  &  Wasko,  1983,   p. xx . This pattern characterizes not only west- ern academia, but also the majority of media  studies  scholarship  around  the  world,  where  conventional  wisdom  sees  social  media  and  smart  devices   e.g.,  mobile  phones  and  apps  for teenagers  as socially constructed around  discourses of leisure, fun, and consumption.  Yet,  labor,  employment,  and  questions  of  inclusion and equality in the digital economy  have  been  classic  topics  in  Internet  studies  from the beginning of the field  e.g., DiMaggio,  Hargittai, Neuman & Robinson, 2001; Servon,  2002 ,  following  a  much  longer  intellectual  tradition that can be traced back to the seminal  work by Daniel Bell in the 1970s and Manuel  Castells since the 1980s  Qiu, 2013 . As social  media  spread  rapidly  in  the  aftermath  of  the  2008–2009  global  financial  crisis,  there  has  also  been  a  revival  of  scholarly  interests  in    298  ‘digital  labor’,  for  instance,  conceived  in  the  new  social  and  technological  contexts  of  ‘the  Internet  as  factory  and  playground’   Scholz,  2013 . Among others, Christian Fuchs  2014a,  2014b  has proposed that we need to re-imag- ine social media platforms as much more than  places of entertainment and tools of consump- tion; that they are, instead, also instruments of  capital accumulation as well as sites of strug- gles for ‘the commons of society’  2014a, Loc  7772 . Such arguments by Scholz, Fuchs, and  colleagues  shed  light  on  new  prospects  for  a  socialist future and the emancipation of labor,  broadly defined to include employees in social  media  industries  and  ordinary  social  media  users  as  well.  These  ongoing  debates  about  social media and labor, which this chapter will  summarize,  elaborate,  and  reflect  upon,  have  ushered in a new phase of progressive academic  intervention.  Against  a  neoliberal  backdrop,  questions  of  collective  and  productive  labor  power  have  emerged  paradoxically  as  issues  of labor re-enter the world-historical limelight:  social media workers of the world, unite!  The reality is, of course, much more com- plicated.  This  chapter  shall  guide  readers  through  the  key  conceptual  and  empirical  developments  in   digital   labor  studies  and  the  research  on  social  media,  while  making  proposals for a new critical research agenda  for  social  media  and  labor.  The  context  of  this discussion includes not only post-indus- trial  societies  but  also  the  Global  South  at  this very interesting time when ‘the Internet  is much less West-centric [than before], and  rapidly  diversifying  as  the  world’s  popu- lations  engage  with  it  in  their  own  ways’    Wu & Taneja, 2016 .  shifTing grounds, shifTing  perspecTives  Speaking  of  social  media,  José  van  Dijck  writes:  The  very  word  ‘social’  associated  with  media  implies  that  platforms  are  user-centered  and  that   they facilitate communal activities, just as the term  ‘participatory’  emphasizes  human  collaboration.  Indeed, social media can be seen as online facilita- tors  or  enhancers  of  human  networks  –  webs  of  people  that  promote  connectedness  as  a  social  value.  2013, p. 11   However, in the short span of a few years, the  culture  of  human  connectedness  on  social  media  platforms  was  transformed  into  what  van Dijck calls ‘the culture of connectivity’   2013   that  is  much  more  commercialized  and privatized to the extent that critics such  as  Toby  Miller  now  calls  them  ‘anti-social’  media  2015 .  The  shift  of  platform  operations  from  mediated  sociality  and  participatory  culture  to commerce and stock market performance  is, of course, not the only dynamic that mat- ters. There are also instances when the forces  of  marketization  were  stalled   e.g.,  Flickr   or  remain  ineffective   e.g.,  Wikipedia .  But  the  sweeping  influence  of  commercializa- tion in social media industries has added to  the imperative to highlight labor as an essen- tial  dimension  of,  and  a  persistently  neces- sary approach to, social media. More than a  binary opposition, the configuration of labor- capital  relationship  varies  depending  on  the  concrete  market  and or  power  dynamics.  This can be seen in systems of social media  where van Dijck portrays ‘the cat-and-mouse  game between platform users and owners’ as  ‘a struggle to define the conditions for online  sociality’   2013,  p.  109 .  More  specifically,  here she is analyzing Flickr, a prominent case  when the force of commercialization toward  ‘connectivity’ was unsuccessful due to resist- ance from ‘platform users’, i.e., the source of  labor power.  Conceived as such, the particular meanings  of social media vary greatly across time and  space; so do their functions at the individual,  communal   including  in  virtual  communi- ties , and societal levels. Extending an earlier  argument   Qiu,  2013 ,  I  submit  that  that  an  oft-forgotten but always necessary demarca- tion line between different labor formations  in social media is class. This idea builds on    labor and soCial Media  299  my  earlier  concept  of  ‘working-class  ICTs’   Qiu,  2009 ,  by  which  I  understand  a  large  spectrum  of  low-end  ICT  tools  such  as  cybercafés  and  inexpensive  mobile  devices,  which serve disadvantaged populations from  migrants and retiree to ethnic minorities and  people with disabilities. Extending this idea,  we can construe ‘working-class social media’  as a new category covering both the techno- logical  tools  serving  working-class  users  and  the  social  relations  between  such  plat- forms  and  the  working-class  groups.  These  include, for example, platforms such as QQ  in  China,  which  shall  be  discussed  in  more  detail below. In other words, the concept of  ‘working-class social media’ is not just about  Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and Instagram,  although  they  have  attracted  working-class  users  as  well.  More  importantly,  it  encom- passes  cybercafés  and  their  customers  in  Trinidad, Filipino domestic helpers Skyping  home  from  Dubai,  and Africans  using  Mxit  to coordinate the transfer of remittances via  M-Pesa.  Calling  social  media  ‘working-class’  is  not intended merely to highlight that the new  digital  platforms  are  used  by  people  with  lower  socio-economic  status;  that  they  are  cheap  and  sometimes  unreliable.  Moreover,  it signifies that the media are in the hands of  those  who  have  ‘less  information  overload  or less commitment to the status quo’  Qiu,  2009,  p.  13 ;  that  social  media  now  serve  more closely the existential needs of working  people around the world, from job-seeking to  access to reliable health services, rather than  entertainment  alone;  and  that  the  prospects  remain for a working-class media landscape  characterized by fairness, inclusiveness, non- rivalry, and mutual help.  four modes of producTion  What then is labor? And where in relation to  social media is labor to be located? Following  Maxwell   2015 ,  this  chapter  uses  a  broad   definition  of  labor  as  productive  human  resources and social processes that generate  wealth, wellbeing, and or social relations in  ways that may or may not benefit the laborers  themselves.  Labor,  in  this  sense,  is  much  more than ‘work’ as the latter usually oper- ates within the constraints of workplaces and  work  posts,  whereas  the  former  is  much  more  generic  and  universal.  More  specifi- cally,  social  media  and  labor  intersect  each  other in at least four ‘modes of production’,  to use the classic Marxian term, which I term  respectively   a   ‘natural  labor  of  sociality’,   b   ‘wage  labor’,   c   ‘free  labor’,  and   d   ‘labor of struggle’. We will see that the con- crete meanings of labor are different, some- times  even  contradictory,  in  these  four  categories. In actuality, the four modes also  overlap,  clash,  and  combine  into  endless  variations. This section describes the produc- tive forces in each mode and the relations of  production therein.  Natural Labor of Sociality  In the theme song of their second CD album  ‘Ode to Labor’ published in Beijing in 2007   http:  ow.ly Z0MUo ,  the  New  Labor  Art  Troupe sings:  it is wrong to say that we have nothing we have our wisdom and our hands we build streets, bridges and high-rises with our  wisdom and hands … From now until forever  glories to workers!  The lyrics reflect a concept of ‘natural labor’:  labor  before  alienation  and  estrangement,  when workers possess their labor power and  means of production, be they intellectual or  physical,  and  they  control  the  benefits  of  production  processes.  Take  this  band  as  an  example: it consists of migrant workers who  happen to love music. They formed a coop- erative, adopted Creative Commons licenses,  and  published  their  CDs  to  support  the  ele- mentary school in their migrant-worker com- munity.  By  2005  they  had  sold  more  than    300  100,000  copies  of  their  first  CD  album.  By  2016  they  had  published  eight  albums,  all  available  on  their  own  website  ‘Singing  Aloud   dashengchang,  www.dashengchang. org.cn Music.htm ’.  Their  creative  work  would have been far less successful without  social  media,  in  this  case, Weibo   the  most  popular  Twitter-like  service  in  China   and  QQ  Qiu, 2009, pp. 121–123 .  By  using  the  descriptor  ‘natural’,  I  frame  sociality and acts of communication as innate  to human nature. Homo sapiens are social ani- mals; and communication is a concrete prac- tice as well as systems of labor that generate  use-value both for individuals and for collec- tive social forces. To listen, to speak, to pro- cess information for oneself or one’s family, to  mobilize others to join a social cause – these  all require labor as it is defined at the begin- ning of this section.  In terms of the history of the English lan- guage,  Raymond  Williams  noted  that  ‘[t]he  sense of labor as pain was applied to childbirth’  from the sixteenth century  1983, p. 176 . In a  similarly  natural  mode  of  production,  social  media  users  communicate  with  each  other  without depending on capitalist platforms for  the exchange of messages and the distribution  of benefits. A case in point is Wikipedia and  the Wikimedia networks in and across differ- ent societies, which to this day remain a non- commercial and collaborative commons. The  Wikipedians may be toiling with their entries,  but they are not doing it to enrich some private  owners of the platform or to serve the interests  of advertisers. Instead, they are creating value  and meaning for themselves while providing  a public good – like giving birth to children  enriches society at large.  From  ancient  China  to  medieval  Europe,  the  repetitive  movements  of  manual  labor  have long been praised for their generation of  use-value and as a source of genuine pleasure,  of concerted efforts in workmanship, of musi- cal rhythm and artistic value, for instance, in  the mode of the ‘mechanical arts’  Whitney,  1990 .  I  hold  that  such  a  mode  of  labor,  in  its natural and pleasant forms, can still exist   in  social  media  usage  so  long  as  the  user  sticks  to  her  or  his  innate  needs  for  social- ity and exercise what Jean-Jacques Rousseau  would  call  a  ‘natural  sensibility’   Voirol,  2016 . The nature that surrounded Rousseau   or the peasants for that matter  might differ  considerably  from  the  nature  before  human  intervention, but still he was able to exercise  his natural capacity, for example in appreciat- ing the beauty of plants and thus improving  his  own  wellbeing,  despite  the  agricultural  developments  of  his  time.  Similarly,  in  the  man-made gardens of social media, it is still  possible  to  perform  natural  labor  despite  structural  constraints  of  corporate  strategies  and state regulation although mediated soci- ality  and  its  unmediated  forms  are  not  the  same. One may speculate that it is precisely  the allure of such unalienated labor of social- ity that attracts people to social media, who  may or may not be aware of the other hidden  dimensions  of  social  media  operations  dis- cussed below.  Wage Labor  In  contrast  to  the  idealized  perception  of  labor  as  an  innate,  uplifting  element  of  human  nature,  a  much  more  familiar  and  widespread  idea  is  to  consider  labor  as  unnatural,  tedious,  and  agonizing.  Being  unpleasant,  laboring  thus  requires  monetary  compensation  or  motivation;  and  hence,  wage labor emerges.  Like any modern industry, the functioning  of  social  media  depends  on  the  labor  input  of  employees,  who  perform  tasks  that  are  essential  to  the  business,  such  as  program- ming,  designing  graphics,  and  office  opera- tions  in  the  corporate  headquarters  of  the  social  media  companies. A  notable  trend  in  recent years is automation and its associated  discourse, which promises to reduce the size  of  the  human  labor  force  through  deploying  advanced  algorithms  and  cloud  computing   Steiner, 2012; Lokot & Diakopoulos, 2015 .  Such processes of automation have resulted in    labor and soCial Media  301  lay-offs, rising precarity, and increasing casu- alization of the workforce, which work both in  actuality and as a rhetoric to marginalize and  disempower those who are employed by the  social media companies. But as shown in the  infamous case of Facebook using journalism- school graduates to conduct manual curation  of ‘trending news’  Nunez, 2016 , what looks  like automation on the surface may in fact be  low-paid precarious human employees work- ing under degrading conditions.  This is of course not the first time we have  seen the persistence of wage labor in suppos- edly high-tech industries – wage labor in new  and old forms, at new and old locations, from  Indian  programmers  working  in  Australia   Xiang, 2008  to Chinese engineers maintain- ing cloud-computing facilities  Mosco, 2014 ,  from  commercial  content  moderators  in  the  Philippines  Roberts, 2014  to ‘Google labor  aristocracy’   Fuchs,  2014a,  Loc  5222   and  Facebook  employees  working  on  corporate  branding  Marwick, 2013  in Silicon Valley.  Despite the discourse of automation, none  of the social media platforms has succeeded in   getting rid of its employees entirely. Indeed,  none of them has really attempted to because  their  founders  and  CEOs,  like  Facebook’s  Mark Zuckerberg, know they cannot write all  the code themselves; nor can they exclusively  hire  robots  for  sales,  customer  service,  and  bookkeeping.  For  all  these  tasks,  they  have  to  rely  on  wage  labor  that  belongs  to  what  Maurizio  Lazarrato  refers  to  as  the  ‘classic  forms’  of  ‘immaterial  labor’  as  in  ‘audio- visual  production,  advertising,  fashion,  the  production of software, photography, cultural  activities’  1996, p. 133 , which again in the  case  of  Facebook  includes  the  journalism- school  graduates  they  hired  to  manually  curate ‘trending news’  Nunez, 2016 .  In  addition  to  the  full-time  and  part-time  employees  directly  on  the  payroll  of  social  media  companies,  there  is  a  much  broader  wage  labor  force  that  produces  the  tangi- ble  commodities  and  intangible  services  that  enable  the  social  media  industry.  Fuchs   2015   considers  all  of  them  as  parts  of  the  International Division of Digital labor  IDDL   and visualizes the framework in Figure 16.1.  figure 16.1  cycles constituting the international division of digital labor Source: Fuchs  2015, p. 88    302  In  this  conceptualization,  ‘S’  stands  for  subjects  or  workers  providing  labor  power;  ‘O’ stands for objects or means of production,  including raw materials; ‘T’ stands for tech- nology or the tools used by subjects to process  objects and produce the desired commodities,  which sit at the tip of the four triangular rela- tionships represented in Figure 16.1.  immaterial   In  order  for   labor   e.g.,  Facebook  workers   to  produce  content  at  the  informational  level  of  IDDL,  there  has  to be an industrial system directly underpin- ning it and an agricultural extractive system  further  below.  Digital  media  technologies,  such  as  laptops,  smartphones,  accessories,  and servers, must be made, for example, by  workers at Foxconn, the world’s largest elec- tronics contract manufacturer  Chan & Pun,  2010; Sandoval, 2013 . But Foxconn doesn’t  produce  all  the  ICT  components,  which  instead have to be made elsewhere in main- land  China,  Taiwan,  Korea,  Japan,  the  UK,  Germany,  and  the  USA.  The  raw  materials  for  ICT  components  come  from  the  bottom  of the IDDL, where key minerals for indus- trial  ICT  production  are  extracted:  coltan  from  Congo,  tin  from  Indonesia,  gold  from  Peru. The most notorious case at the bottom  level of IDDL is the usage of slave labor in  the extraction of Congolese conflict-minerals   Steinweg & de Haan, 2007 .  Industrial  and  agricultural  workers  in  the  middle and lower strata of the IDDL do not  directly  participate  in  the  information  labor  system  of  social  media.  But  their  indirect  involvement as wage labor provides the mate- rial basis for informational immaterial work.  Fuchs’s  diagram  does  not  exhaust  all  forms  of wage labor in the IDDL broadly defined,  for instance, the infrastructure of fiber optics,  electricity, and transportation systems deliv- ering minerals to components makers, com- ponents to assembly factories, and computers  to  social  media  firms.  All  these  infrastruc- tures need to be built and maintained based  on  wage  labor,  whose  scope  can  be  greatly  broadened beyond the shop floor of Foxconn  or Facebook.  Within  the  informational  labor  system  there  is  of  course  more  than  Facebook  and  similar  social  media  firms  that  operate  as  for-profit  companies  or  social  enterprises,  such  as  Fairphone,  which  strives  to  provide  ethical  alternatives  to  smartphone  consum- ers   see  www.fairphone.com  .  Meanwhile,  there are those employed in the public sector  and  state  security  bodies  around  the  world,  including those providing the essential labor  power for surveillance operations. The most  well-known among them is probably Edward  Snowden,  the  former  US  National  Security  Agency   NSA   subcontractor  who  leaked  information  about  NSA’s  spy  program,  Prism,  and  caused  major  scandal  to  the  US  intelligence services in 2013.  But  state-based  social  media  wage  labor  goes beyond surveillance. In China, authori- ties have hired people to put up pro-govern- ment  posts  to  online  forums  or  sending  out  anti-activism  messages  via  popular  social  media  platforms  such  as  Weibo,  WeChat,  and  Twitter.  Initially  they  were  nicknamed  ‘wumaodang’  or  ‘50-cents-party’  for  the  piecework  they  performed  at  the  wage  of  50  cents  per  message.  In  a  way  not  funda- mentally  different  from  Facebook’s  using  manual workers to generate ‘trending news’   Nunez, 2016 , Chinese censors were found  to  be  using  intensive  ‘professional’  human  labor instead of automated programs in their  efforts  to  suppress  or  skew  Internet  discus- sions  King, Pan, & Roberts, 2013 . Over the  years,  the  proactive  online  propaganda  sys- tem  has  also  expanded  and  upgraded  into  a  full industry to monitor, analyze, and shape  public  opinion  using  new  organizational  as  well  as  technological  measures   Creemers,  2015 ,  meaning  that  the  authorities  often  need to hire more hands at higher wages.  Free Labor  Since Tiziana Terranova’s foundational essay   2000 ,  the  oxymoronic  concept  of  ‘free  labor’  has  been  central  to  conceptions  of    labor and soCial Media  303  Internet  and  knowledge  economy  where  ‘productive  activities  that  are  pleasurably  embraced and at the same time often shame- lessly exploited’  p. 37 . These oddly ‘free’  practices  are  arguably  more  pronounced  in  social media platforms than in  other realms  of Internet communication due to the perva- siveness  and  seemingly  mundane  nature  of  social media modalities.  We  don’t  pay  anything  to  use  Twitter  or  QQ, or so we are told. Users, therefore, often  see these services and the content they pro- vide  as  completely  free  of  charge.  This  is,  however, incorrect as the platforms ‘charge’  users  by  accumulating  valuable  informa- tion  about  the  users,  their  usage  and  other  patterns,  and  profiting  from  it.  Hence,  in  exchange  for  the  seemingly  ‘free’  stuff  that  we enjoy online, social media companies get  our time, our attention, our UGC  user gen- erated content , our social networks, and all  kinds of meta data about us and our daily life,  free of charge as well.  In addition to targeted advertising, much of  the data gathered about us is used to improve  our user experiences so that the social media  platforms  become  more  ‘sticky’,  i.e.,  we  would  spend  more  time  on  these  platforms,  thereby  generating  even  more  data  for  the  companies.  On  the  one  hand,  we  get  more  convenience  and  better  online  experiences;  on the other hand, the social media platforms  can  have  more  effective  corporate  surveil- lance over us, thus making us more suscepti- ble to targeted advertising. This is, however,  an  unequal  barter  because  the  companies  almost always dictate the terms of exchange.  As such, free labor in social media systems is  ultimately about absorbing unpaid work con- tributed by Internet users and fans, which can  be  used  to  substitute  traditional  paid  work  in  a  wide  variety  of  activities,  such  as  pro- gramming  and  marketing   Terranova,  2000;  Kücklich,  2005;  Andrejevic,  2008;  Fuchs,  2014a  in order to generate wealth for plat- form  owners  and  stockholders.  If  a  product  goes viral through Facebook, even if it is part  of a socially engineered campaign, the bulk   of  the  promotional  work  is  performed  by  unpaid social media users and their ‘friends’  through their clicking, forwarding, and com- menting.  This  is  an  extreme  mode  for  the  casualization,  valorization,  and  exploitation  of media labor that ‘allows companies to out- source paid labor time to consumers or fans  who work for free’  Fuchs, 2014a, Loc 2957 . From  a  political  economy  perspective,  Dallas Smythe offered a critique decades ago  that  the  commercial  model  for  advertising- funded  mass  media  was  to  turn  audiences  into ‘audience commodity’  1977, 1981 . He  wrote,  ‘As  collectives  these  audiences  are  commodities. As commodities they are dealt  with in markets by producers [media organi- zations]  and  buyers  [advertisers]’   1981,  p. 234 . Unpaid audiences can in this sense  be seen as ‘workers’: ‘In “their” time which  is  sold  to  advertisers,  workers   a   perform  essential marketing functions for the produc- ers of consumers’ goods, and  b  work at the  production and reproduction of labor power’   1977, p. 3 .  With  the  spread  of  advertising-funded  Internet  and  social  media,  Smythe’s  ‘audi- ence commodity’ critique has received more  scholarly  attention  in  recent  years.  There  are,  on  the  one  hand,  strong  objections,  for  instance  from  David  Hesmondhalgh,  who  takes  Smythe’s  view  as  ‘crude,  reductionist  and  functionalist’  in  seeing  audience  work   including  via  social  media   as  merely  pro- ducing  audience  commodities  for  advertis- ers following a capitalist mode of production  while  ‘totally  underestimating  contradiction  and struggle in capitalism’  2010, p. 280 .  On the other hand, Christian Fuchs  2015   extends Smythe’s analysis to platforms rely- ing on advertising, although not to other types  of social media that do not rely on advertis- ing. In so doing, Fuchs separates ‘production  workers’  from  ‘circulation  workers’  in  PR  and advertising departments, who have a hid- den division of labor in generating use-value,  value, and symbolic value based directly on  their  unpaid  work,  and  indirectly  on  paid  employees and wage labor at Facebook and    304  related  companies   2015,  pp.  89–90 .  The  process  generates  a  new  social  media  audi- ence  commodity  that  adds  to  the  effects  of  viral marketing campaigns and the consump- tion  meanings  of  the  products  and  services  being promoted. In other words, from the per- spective of the advertising industry, through  social  media  they  have  gained  new  armies  of  volunteers  who  share  their  content   e.g.,  memes  and new expansive sets of social net- works to further the goals of advertisers with- out considering themselves as being eligible  for the payroll.  How large is the ‘free labor’ force working  for  Facebook?  According  to  DMR   2016 ,  Facebook  has  1.59  billion  monthly  active  users around the world, of whom 1.04 billion   are active on daily basis. Meanwhile, Global  Web  Index  found  that,  in  January  2015,  on  average  Internet  users  spend  1.72  hours  on  social  network  everyday   Mander,  2015 .  Considering  active  daily  user  population  only,  this  means  in  2015,  Facebook  has  acquired 652.91 billion hours of labor power  from  its  users  globally.  In  comparison,  this  amount  of  labor  power  is  more  than  100  times larger than all the waged labor power  accumulated by Foxconn, the world’s largest  electronics manufacturer with more than 1.3  million factory workers in China. Not only is  Facebook 100 times ‘bigger’ than Foxconn in  term of its total labor power acquisition, it is  also ‘free’ because Facebook does not need  to compensate Facebook users. ‘One hundred  per  cent  of  their  labor  time  is  surplus  labor  time,  which  allows  capitalists  to  generate  extra surplus value and extra profits’  Fuchs,  2014a, p. 263 . No wonder Facebook’s busi- ness is more lucrative than Foxconn.  One  way  to  connect  ‘free’  social  media  usage and classic issues of labor is through the  intellectual tradition of autonomist Marxism,  for  instance,  Michael  Hardt  and  Antonio  Negri’s  influential  idea  of  the  ‘multitude’   Hardt & Negri, 2005  about how immaterial  labor working in an enlarged planetary ‘social  factory’ can serve as the basis of world revo- lution. The root of this idea can be traced back   to Negri’s Red Notes, published four decades  ago, when he wrote presciently that, facing the  crises of the 1970s, capitalism would need ‘a  project that is qualitatively different’, one that  separates production from circulation, aiming  at creating a ‘productive subject’ incapable of  collective action and solidarity  1979, p. 34 .  As revealed by Alice Marwick’s ethnography  in Silicon Valley, social media platforms such  as  Facebook  serve  exactly  this  function  of  the  social  factory  in  producing  an  individu- alist  and  consumerist  subjectivity  and  ‘ideal  neoliberal selves’  2013, Loc 105 . However,  Negri  and  Hardt  have  gone  further  with  a  bold  hypothesis  that  dialectically  this  social  factory also sows the seeds of its own destruc- tion by producing the multitude, subjects who  serve as the social basis for a new worldwide  communist revolution, who are now also con- nected via the Internet.  Meanwhile,  an  arguably  more  impor- tant, yet often forgotten, conception of ‘free  labor’ is the feminist tradition à la Leopodina  Fortunati   2007 .  Although  conventional  studies  of  labor  often  focus  exclusively  on  wage labor, feminist scholarship has argued  since the 1970s that women’s unpaid work in  domestic settings, such as cleaning, cooking  and  parenting,  enabled  the  male  breadwin- ners  to  be  productive  outside  the  home. As  such, women’s housework and carework are  not  a  ‘natural’  attribute  of  womanhood,  but  they  indeed  produce  economic  value  essen- tial  to  modern  society,  not  to  mention  their  cultural  values.  Yet  women’s  contribution  is  often  rendered  invisible  because  they  are  unpaid. Fortunati connects this critique more  specifically  to  new  technologies  when  she  analyzes  the  ‘mechanizing’  of  housework  and  immaterial  labor  more  generally  that  includes  various  carework,  communication  work, affection, and labor of sociality. ‘The  mass  possession  of  these  intellective  tech- nologies represents an important ground for  political experimentation and for a new the- ory  and  practice  of  communication,  as  well  as  a  strategic  moment  of  self-valorization’   Fortunati, 2007, p. 153 .   labor and soCial Media  305  Here,  Fortunati  is  not  only  critiquing  the  bias  against  women’s  unwaged  work.  She  also makes a key point that is often ignored  in  the  analysis  of  social  media  globally:  free  labor  is  not  limited  to  the  core  regions  of  western  societies.  Instead,  ‘ g lobaliza- tion  separates  the  material  elements  from  the immaterial ones of the  same production  process. The latter very often remains in the   post industrialized  countries  while  the  for- mer is located in developing countries, which  brings  the  international  division  of  labor  to  another  level’   ibid.,  p.  154 .  Against  this  backdrop, free labor in the Global North and  the Global South may seem to be identical in  their outlook, but they are not. For the labor- ing subjects, female or male, the actual func- tions  and  meanings  of  their  spending  hours  each  day  doing  unwaged  work  online  can  be  drastically  different.  The  consequence  of  exchange-value  overwhelming  use-value  may  simply  be  more  wealth  for  platform  owners  in  Silicon  Valley  and  less  face-to- face interactions in western societies. But for  those residing in the Global South, the same  behavior  may  mean  more  serious  malnutri- tion  and  livelihood  problems  in  rural  fami- lies, more work injuries and more deaths on  the shop floor caused by sleep deprivation in  the factory zones. The real-life cost of ‘free  labor’ can be much, much higher for people  in the developing world.  In her analysis of ‘the Digital Housewife’   2016 ,  Kylie  Jarrett  extends  the  feminist  Marxist tradition into a full-fledged critique  of digital labor and the economics of affect  under  conditions  of  Web  2.0  and  social  media.  In  so  doing,  she  builds  on,  while  transcending,  the  Automist  Marxist  argu- ment  about  the  ‘social  factory’   à  la  Hardt  & Negri, 2005  as well as other classic con- ceptions of media and exploitation including  Smythe’s  ‘audience  commodity’. According  to Jarrett, ‘Exploited in and vital to capital- ist  circuits,  domestic  work  is  often  simulta- neously socially meaningful and resistant to  capture, particularly in its immaterial forms’   2016,  p.  11 .  Like  unpaid  domestic  work,   social  media  labor  is  a  complex  system  of  valorization that generates economic and cul- tural values that are vital to society. A typical  social media user serves ‘double duty’ as s he  ‘is unpaid and freely contributes content that  provides these  social media  sites with their  appeal  to  other  users,  while  also  generat- ing readily repackaged data about consumer  trends, tastes and desires. Moreover, s he also  produces shared meanings and builds social  solidarity  in  those  same  interactions’   ibid.,  p. 10 . More than merely reproducing labor  itself along with the mode of production and  consumption  relations  embedded  in  capital- ism,  this  system  of  valorization  examined  through  the  lens  of  the  Digital  Housewife  also  serves  as  a  basis  for  conceptual  depar- ture from patriarchic power relations and for  activism  against  capitalism,  whereby  ‘free  labor’ may be ultimately set free.  It is mportant to note that the trend toward  ‘free labor’ is more than a feminist critique  in  the  era  of Web  2.0;  and  that  it  had  been  widespread in the media and cultural indus- tries  long  before  the  emergence  of  social  media. Mark Andrejevic’s account of ‘social  network  exploitation’   2008 ,  for  example,  is  not  really  about  the  latest  technological  innovations. Instead, it is about a consistent  pattern stretching at least from reality TV to  social  media  whereby  amateur  labor  being  paid either nothing or little more than token  appreciation is asked to carry out tasks that  used to be performed by professionals. Most  importantly,  ‘social  network  exploitation’  works when the amateurs ‘willingly’ accept  the  deal  and  perform  ‘happily’  within  the  system.  Where does free labor lead us to? Is it Jacob  Silverman’s exclamation: ‘I share, therefore I  am – more interesting, more sociable, more  desirable, more myself’  2015, p. ix ? Or is it  Hardt and Negri’s ‘multitude’  2005 , paving  the  way  for  world  revolution?  It  is  perhaps  too  early  to  make  any  conclusive  remarks,  although with Melissa Gregg, Kate Crawford  and I have contended that the challenges are  as great as the opportunities  Qiu, Gregg, &    306  Crawford,  2014 ;  and  that  it  is  incorrect  to  see  the  two  opposite  directions  of  develop- ment as separate spheres.  Gregg,  Crawford,  and  I  developed  a  dia- gram  called  ‘the  circuits  of  labor’   ibid.   to  visualize  our  argument  while  connecting  many  different  conceptions  of  digital  labor  beyond the usual binaries of labor: material  vs.  immaterial,  waged  vs.  free,  progress  vs.  conservative   see  Figure  16.2 .  On  the  left- hand side, economic capital dominates body  and  extracts  surplus  value  generated  in  the  lower hierarchies of the system, especially by  blue- and grey-collar workers.  ‘Grey collar’  is a term used in China for low-end informa- tional workers . This is essentially the system   of wage labor and free labor under corporate  control through physical discipline, monetary  rewards, and or socio-psychological domina- tion  that  often  leads  to  precarity  and  anxie- ties  among  workers.  The  top-down  power  inequality  is  expressed  and  guaranteed  by  formal agreements of labor contracts, market  transaction records, and or intellectual prop- erty right regimes.  On  the  right,  the  mode  of  production  is  more egalitarian from the perspectives of the  laboring  body,  whereas  capital  is  not  only  economic  but  also  social  and  cultural,  as  conceived of by Bourdieu  1986 . Workers –  free social media labor included – engage in  the  ‘natural  labor  of  sociality’  for  their  own   figure 16.2  The circuits of labor  col : formal and informal exchanges   labor and soCial Media  307  pleasure,  survival,  and  collective  formation.  They may or may not require external com- pensation  and  the  rewards  can  take  many  forms:  social,  cultural,  political,  rather  than  merely monetary. Due to the lack of top-down  control,  the  labor  involved  can  take  many  forms, such volunteer, hacker, care work, and  love. Although affective labor and free labor  appear in this circuit as well, the power rela- tions  differ  considerably  from  the  left-hand  side because they are usually tacit knowledge  and informal customs. Think, for example, an  autonomous fan community or the network of  a hackivist group.  The two circuits of labor  CoLs  – formal  exploitation  through  vertical  domination  on  the left, informal sociality through horizontal  networking on the right – are short-circuited  by ‘playbor’  those who play online without  being  able  to  control  the  valorization  pro- cesses  and  intellectual  property  rights,  such  as gamers; see Küklich, 2005  and ‘survival  labor’  those who are disposed of in capital- ist modes of production, such as injured fac- tory workers . Conceptualized as such, either  the  vertical  system  of  formal  CoL  or  the  horizontal system of informal CoL can draw  resources  from  the  other. The  flow  of  crea- tivity and politico-economic energy is multi- directional and dialectical.  Due  to  space  limitations,  I  cannot  further  explicate this model here, although interested  readers can refer to Qiu, Gregg, and Crawford   2014 . But the takeaway lesson is: the future  of digital labor, including social media labor  and free labor, is up to agentic human actors on  both sides of the circuits – to resist top-down  control that reduces us into subhumans and to  expand our liberty and humanity through net- working and innovative interventions.  Labor of Struggle  The term ‘labor’ has a fourth connotation in  addition to the other three  something natural  for  human  activities,  something  done  in  exchange for wages, and something ‘free’ to   be exploited . That is, labor is an organized  collective  political  force  for  workers  to  defend  their  rights  and  push  for  a  better  society.  In his article ‘Social or anti-social media?’,   Toby Miller  2015  writes:  When I interviewed people involved in Hong Kong’s  2014 Umbrella Revolution, I found a very different  story  from  the  dominant  Anglo  narrative,  which  celebrated  the  social  media’s  role  in  the  uprising.  Young and middle-aged activists alike told me that  longstanding class-based organizations and demo- cratic  interpersonal   connections – experienced face to face – were more  crucial organizational tools.  tendencies,  and  new   His observation reveals a pattern that is rather  consistent  with  evidence  from  other  parts  of  the  world  where  long-lasting,  on-the-ground  labor  struggle  often  not  only  predates  social  media  uprisings  but  also  serves  as  a  crucial  factor explaining if and how the social media  uprising  can  be  successful  or  not.  Consider,  for  instance,  Egypt  and  Tunisia,  both  with  strong  unionism  tradition  and  face-to-face  solidarity  among  workers  on  the  one  hand   Alexander  &  Bassiouny,  2014   vis-à-vis  Libya  and  Syria,  where  such  legacies  were  much weaker on the other hand, the fallout of  the  events  can  be  much  explained  when  we  consider  the  strength  of  the  existing  labor  movement above and beyond the oversimpli- fied framework of social media diffusion  e.g.,  as  reflected  in  the  problematic  phrase  of  ‘Twitter revolution’; see Esfandiari, 2010 .  How then do workers use social media to  strengthen  solidarity  and  extend  it  beyond  the  conventional  scope  of  labor  parties  and  unionism,  especially  during  labor  move- ments, old and new? To explore this question,  I draw most of the following examples from  China, where I conduct the bulk of my empir- ical work. By my understanding, China also  has the world’s longest-living working-class  social  media   i.e.,  QQ .  In  the  third  quarter  of 2015, QQ has 850 million monthly active  users  Wang, 2015 . Most of these are mem- bers  of  the  information  have-less  from  the  lower classes, including ordinary workers.   308  QQ  started  in  1999  as  a  copycat  service  of the then-popular instant messenger, ICQ.  I first heard about it from a focus group that  I conducted in Zhuhai, South China, among  female migrant workers in 2002, when young  office  clerks  were  already  using  QQ  for  social networking and for instrumental goals  such as learning how to use a new software.  Chinese workers quickly discovered that QQ  is well suited for organizing information and  mobilizing peers at times of collective strug- gle. According to a work-injury victim who  won the legal battle against his former boss  and  were  helping  fellow  workers  with  their  lawsuits:  I like QQ because I can store phone numbers, legal  documents, and all kinds of useful information in  it. Here  in a factory zone of South China  it’s so  hot and humid, and it’s cumbersome to have pen  and paper with me all the time. But once I log onto  QQ  through mobile phone , I see all the informa- tion I need.  QQ  became  a  stronger  tool  for  collective  struggle  when  it  started  to  offer  the  ‘QQ  Group   QQ  qun ’  service,  which  includes  a  full  range  of  online  community-building  tools  such  as  group  chat,  photo  album,  and  file sharing.  In  2004,  three  major  instances  of  labor  uprising took place that marked the beginning  of social media on the picket line  Qiu, 2016 .  Before then, nearly all strikes in China were  kept under local information block-down by  the authorities. But strikers in a textile factory  of  Xianyang,  Shaanxi  Province   Northwest  China , and a military equipment factory in  Chongqing  Southwest China  first used QQ  and local forms to break the silence of cen- sorship and call for national and international  attention. Then workers at a Japanese-owned  electronics  factory  in  Shenzhen   South  China   used  QQ  and  Weblogs  to  publicize  daily  records  of  their  struggle  vis-à-vis  the  management.  Their  story  made  headlines,  including  in  The  New  York  Times   French,  2004 . This was three years prior to China’s  middle  class  starting  to  use  Internet  tools   to  organize  collective  action  in  landmark  cases such as the 2007 Xiamen PX incident.  Workers were leading the tidal wave of his- tory probably not because they were techno- logically sophisticated but because they had  the economic needs and political will.  During this early stage, workers were using  basic  texts  and  images  to  communicate.  But  soon they began to use poetry and videos. One  good example is the Ole Wolff struggle dur- ing 2006–2009 in Yantai, Shandong Province,  East  China   China  Labor  News  Translation,  2009 . Ole Wolff is a Danish-owned factory.  Their  workers  succeeded  in  organizing  the  first grassroots, independent workplace union  in China, partly due to the national and inter- national support mustered through their online  videos.  Their  account  at  Sina  Video,  titled  ‘China Red Union  zhongguo chise gonghui ’,  had 29 videos. One of them that went viral is  a 90-second video shot on a worker’s mobile  phone  when  a  worker  representative  con- fronted a Danish manager and said, ‘I despise  this kind of behavior [by the employer]’. The  video was unedited and not professional at all,  but  it  was  circulated  widely  via  QQ  Groups  and blogs, and the management finally recog- nized the workers’ union.  Another turning point was 2009–2010 with  the  diffusion  of  micro-blogging  tools  such  as Sina Weibo, whose functioning is similar  to Twitter. Initially Weibo was only popular  among the more affluent users, but following  a crackdown on labor movements, especially  in  South  China  during  2012–2013,  more  workers migrated to Weibo because there was  less censorship on Weibo compared to online  forums in South China, which were vulner- able to influence from local authorities.  Sina  Weibo’s  headquarters  is  located  in  Beijing,  North  China .  This  was  not  to  suggest  that  Weibo  offers  genuine  freedom  for  workers  to express themselves and to mobilize. Since  2013, the crackdown on Weibo-based activ- ism has been greatly intensified nationwide.  However, Weibo remains one of the most pre- ferred tools for Chinese workers in struggle  because it is openly accessible.   labor and soCial Media  309  More  recently,  WeChat   WeiXin   has  become  the  most  widely  used  social  media  platform in China. It is also a product from  Tencent,  the  company  that  operates  QQ.  WeChat is, however, mostly for interpersonal  and small-group interactions among a small  number of people, rather than publicly acces- sible communication like what Weibo allows.  WeChat has a ‘discussion group’ mode that  is  similar  to  QQ  Group  chat,  which  work- ers often use to share logistical information,  images, and call for action among their peers.  Meanwhile,  WeChat  public  account  allows  individual  activists  or  labor  NGOs  to  con- duct  one-to-many  communication  to  their  followers,  almost  like  corporations  using  their company’s Facebook accounts to talk to  their followers. An influential WeChat public  account is Pepper Tribe  jianjiao buluowww. jianjiaobuluo.com    operated  by  and  for  female  migrant  workers,  using  innovative  cartoons,  videos,  and  games  along  with  text-based  stories  and  analytical  articles  to  deliver a unique voice of labor, gender, and  empowerment.  From  QQ  Instant  Messenger  and  QQ  Group to Weibo and WeChat, Chinese work- ers  have  actively  adopted  social  media  in  their existing struggles for more than a dec- ade. Although different platforms had differ- ent features and different periods had distinct   working-class  social  media  dynamics,  over- all the toolkit for picket line and other labor  struggles  has  been  enriched  technologically  because  what  we  have  seen  is  a  cumulative  process. Even to this day, QQ Group remains  arguably the most important online mobiliza- tion and internal communication tool among  workers,  whereas  Internet  video,  local  and  regional forums, Weibo and WeChat all add  to social networking opportunities with more  diverse  audiences  at  critical  moments  when  workers  in  struggle  need  to  call  for  more  public support and or build a broader social  basis.  Of  course,  worker  struggles  are  highly  diverse. The  scope  of  social  media  applica- tions is also remarkably broad under drasti- cally  different  structural  conditions,  e.g.,  clampdown  from  the  factory  regime,  local  state  censorship,  pro-labor  policy  environ- ment. As a result, the role of social media in  labor struggles may look ambiguous and cha- otic. I therefore developed a 2 × 4 typology   Figure  16.3   to  provide  a  systematic  over- view of what I call worker-generated content   WGC .  The  typology  is  constructed  from  using three dichotomous variables:  a  ‘col- lectivity’, i.e., if the producer of the content  is an individual worker or a group of work- ers;  b  ‘activism orientation’, i.e., if the con- tent was created with the intention for social   figure 16.3  seven types of worker-generated content  Wgc    310  change; and  c  ‘empowerment’, i.e., if at the  end labor conditions of the workers involved  were really improved.  Elsewhere   Qiu,  2015   I  offer  a  more  in- depth  discussion  on  each  type  of  WGC,  as  illustrated by workers’ online video activities   each dot in the typology represents a specific  instance of struggle . There are, however, two  general  arguments  applicable  to  working- class social media in general. For one thing,  if the content is generated by atomized indi- vidual  workers  without  an  activist  orienta- tion and does not improve labor conditions,  then it still belongs to UGC  user-generated  content   within  the  conventional  system  of  platform  capitalism  operating  according  to  the logic of ‘the culture of connectivity’  van  Dijck, 2013 . Meanwhile, although the bulk  of  worker’s  social  media  practices  still  fall  into the domain of individualistic, consumer- ist  UGC,  logically  speaking  there  are  seven  possibilities  outside  UGC,  of  which  five  already  have  concrete  instances  of  struggle  materialized in the Chinese context. In other  words, we need to look away from UGC to  appreciate  the  diversity  and  liveliness  of  WGC, of social media being put to practical  ends of labor in struggle.  conclusion  labor,  and   labor,  free   This  chapter  contends  that  labor  –  broadly  defined to include natural labor of sociality,  wage  labor  of   struggle – is arguably the most vital source of  value and valorization in social media opera- tions.  Yet,  it  is  often  rendered  invisible  or  marginalized  through  flashy  and  evanescent  discourses  of  post-industrialism,  consumer  culture, and the stock market. It is therefore  imperative  to  re-examine  the  relationship  between  social  media  and  labor,  which  is,  however,  not  a  novel  exercise.  Classic  con- ceptions of information society often include  considerations  of  labor,  e.g.,  Daniel  Bell’s  ‘meritocracy’  1976 , and Manuel Castells’s   ‘self-programmable labor’  2000 . Since the  turn to the twenty-first century, a new body  of literature has materialized on ‘free labor’,  immaterial  labor,  the  IDDL,  the  Digital  Housewife, and the WGC, all of which shed  light on multiple connections between labor  and  social  media.  This  literature  was  sum- marized and re-organized in order for readers  to have a comprehensive view of the issues at  state.  From a critical political economy perspec- tive,  the  chapter  highlights  the  need  to  tran- scend our constricted experiences with social  media  and  through  social  media  under  cir- cumstances  of  the  Global  North,  and  of  the  West. QQ, Orkut, Mxit, VK, Taringa, Weibo,  WeChat  –  these  platforms,  albeit  less  known  as Facebook or Twitter, have played prominent  roles,  and  are  likely  to  continue  to  do  so,  in  shaping social media landscapes in the Global  South  and  in  societies  beyond  models  of  Eurocentrism. Each of these platforms has its  unique features and lineage. There are major  differences  between  them  and  their  better- known  Western  counterparts,  which  deserve  more systematic exploration in the future when  it comes to issues of labor, from wage labor on  the assembly line, free labor in the data mine,  and  in-between  forms  of  labor  power  in  the  informal sectors and with increasing precarity. For  the  populace  of  the  expansive  Global  South,  are  social  media  a  new  chance  of  upward mobility or another curse of exploita- tion? The defeat of Facebook’s ‘Free Basics’  initiative by civil society groups and start-ups  in India is a case in point, demonstrating the  complexity  and  importance  of  the  issues  at  stake   Bose,  2016 .  While  the  challenge  of  the  digital  divide  persists,  technological  dif- fusion has profoundly transformed the social  class  status  of  digital  media  the  world  over,  changing it from elite platforms of highbrow  discussion  to  grassroots  spaces  of  mundane  interaction  and  everyday  networking  as  well  as  toolkits  for  workers  and  activists  on  the  ground.  Coming  to  terms  with  this  vast,  diverse,  and  rapidly  changing  realm  of  the  world’s  social  media  platforms  means  we    labor and soCial Media  311  have  to  go  beyond  dichotomous  thinking.  Conventional binaries – material and immate- rial labor, suppression and liberation, aliena- tion  and  class-consciousness  –  still  matter.  But  they  have  become  insufficient.  A  ‘cir- cuits’ model  Qiu et al., 2014  is, in this sense,  a  good  example  for  what  we  need:  holistic  approaches  to  re-think  issues  of  labor  with  highly diverse connections to social media.  references  Alexander, A., & Bassiouny, M.  2014 .

Princeton,  NJ:  Princeton  University Press.   17 Silicon Valley and the   Social Media Industry  A l i c e   M a r w i c k  inTroducTion  The  global  center  for  venture-backed  tech- nology startups, both in terms of sheer num- bers of companies, employees, and money, as  well  as  mythological  importance,  is  Silicon  Valley in Northern California. When writing  critically about the industry of social media,  two  things  are  difficult  to  avoid.  First,  it  is  tempting  to  adopt  a  dismissive  or  mocking  stance.  The  peculiar  combination  of  naive  idealism and free market worship that char- acterizes  tech  startups  is  ripe  for  ridicule,  especially  when  examined  outside  its  Northern  Californian  context. The  scramble  to  build  the  best  laundry  startup   Pressler,  2014 , the recent $120 million venture capi- tal  VC  investment in a $700 wi-fi enabled  juicer   Ferdman  and  Ingraham,  2016 ,  or  venture capitalist Tim Draper’s campaign to  divide  California  into  six  states,  of  which  Silicon  Valley  would  be  one   Wohlsen,  2014 ,  seem  goofball  at  best,  clueless  or  juvenile at worst, making it easy to write off   modern tech culture as a clueless echo cham- ber.  This  misses  the  point.  Despite  its  excesses, Silicon Valley functions as a global  imaginary:  it  models  what  is  considered  a  superior  type  of  wealth-generating  innova- tion  for  other  places  eager  to  replicate  its  success.  Thus,  we  must  take  it  seriously  as  attempts are made world-wide to replicate its  practices.  Second, the conflation of ‘Silicon Valley’  with  ‘social  media’  is  complicated.  Most  social  media  companies  are  venture-backed  startups; some are public  Twitter, Facebook ,  some private  Pinterest, Snapchat , and some  have  been  acquired  by  larger  companies   Reddit, YouTube,  Instagram,  Tumblr .  But  most venture-backed technology startups do  not produce social media. At the same time,  many  of  today’s  most  successful  startups  do  build  on  the  original  concepts  of  ‘social  media’  –  user-generated  content,  peer  pro- duction  marketplaces,  collaboratively  gen- erated  information,  datafication  –  to  extend  the logics and aesthetics of social media into    siliCon valley and the soCial Media industry   315  new  realms.  As  Tarleton  Gillespie  writes  elsewhere in this volume, the model of ‘plat- forms’  that  originated  with  social  media  now  extends  to  labor   Uber,  TaskRabbit,  Postmates, Shyp , housing  AirBnB , finance   Venmo,  Kiva ,  and  direct-to-consumer  goods  Casper, Everlane . The co-founder of  mattress company Casper, for instance, told  Inc. magazine that, ‘In the beginning, it was  “Let’s disrupt the mattress industry. It’s bro- ken.” That quickly morphed into “Let’s invent  an industry around sleep.”’ He says ‘We con- sider ourselves a tech company first’  Welch,  2016 .  Affirming  Silicon  Valley’s  values  of  disruption  and  innovation,  Casper  positions  themselves  in  conversation  with  other  suc- cessful  startups,  rather  than  other  mattress  companies,  who  are  implicitly  written  off  as  stodgy  and  out-of-touch  with  modern,  technologically-savvy business practices. To  understand the industry of social media, we  must  look  at  Silicon Valley’s  venture-based  startups,  their  culture,  and  how  this  culture  has been and is being exported – for better or  for worse – around the world.  While  the  idea  of  digital  networks  spurs  fantasies of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘the cloud,’  the  production  of  software  is  very  much  grounded in place. Global sites of technolog- ical production such as Silicon Valley, as well  as  Tel Aviv,  New York,  Sydney,  Bangalore,  London,  and  Berlin,  bring  together  bodies,  technical  infrastructure,  and  capital,  creat- ing  particular  sets  of  socio-economic  cir- cumstances under which software is created.  The  conditions  of  social  media  production  are dominated by startups funded by venture  capital, the most successful of which become  mature,  established  companies,  generat- ing  immense  wealth  for  their  founders  and  early  employees.1  Note  that  I  use  the  term  ‘startup’  in  this  chapter  to  mean  ‘venture- capital backed technology startup.’ The term  is  sometimes  used  to  denote  a  small  busi- ness  that  is  less  than  a  year  old   US  Small  Business Administration Office of Advocacy,  2016a , but startups and small businesses are  distinct.  The  vast  majority  of  entrepreneurs   in  the  United  States,  and  around  the  world,  start small businesses like barber shops, eBay  storefronts,  plumbers,  and  grocery  stores.  Most  of  these  small  business  owners  have  no  employees,  and  they  are  primarily  self- financed  US Small Business Administration  Office  of Advocacy,  2016b . A  startup,  par- ticularly  a  venture-capital-backed  technol- ogy  startup,  is  predicated  on  the  ability  to  scale and the potential for very high growth   Henrekson and Sanandaji, 2014 .  specifically   This  chapter  will  provide  context  for  the  modern era of technology startups by exam- ining  the  history  of  Northern  Californian  software  development,  its   libertarian-countercultural bent known as the  ‘Californian  Ideology,’  which  combines  a  distrust of institutional structures with a deep  belief in the potential of technology for social  change  Barbrook and Cameron, 1996 . This  ideology  has  remained  more-or-less  con- stant  through  60  years  of  boom-and-bust  cycles, from transistors and micro-computers  through to the dot-com boom and Web 2.0.  However,  the  cultures  and  values  of  con- temporary  technological  practice,  specifi- cally  how  myths  of  meritocracy,  openness,  and entrepreneurialism function in the politi- cal economy of the tech industry, are crucial  to  understanding  the  discursive  underpin- nings  of  social  media  technologies,  as  are  the  way  that  space  and  place  influence  the  conceptualization  and  building  of  startups.  Silicon  Valley,  with  a  preponderance  of  young, wealthy men, creates many apps and  services devoted to outsourcing homemaking  and personal chores, while urban- exploration  apps  like  Foursquare  are  designed  for  densely-populated, nightlife-heavy cities like  New York.  A  global  mythology  of  startups  and  entrepreneurship,  spread  through  web- sites  like  Quora,  Hacker  News,  Mashable,  and  TechCrunch,  affects  workers  world- wide. Young men hold up Mark Zuckerberg  and the late Steve Jobs as role models, mimic  ‘best  practices’  outlined  on  blogs  and  dis- cussed  on  Twitter,  and  attend  networking  events modeled after those popular in major    316  global  cities.  Several  institutions  in  which  such  myths  and  cultural  practices  are  repli- cated,  namely  hackathons,  accelerators,  and  Startup Weekends, are re-enacted around the  globe  in  an  attempt  to  bring  Silicon Valley  values to local startup communities. In what  follows,  I  outline  the  major  mythologies  of  this discourse – entrepreneurialism, meritoc- racy, and openness – and how they contrib- ute  to  specific  conditions  of  technological  production, such as funding rates and hiring  practices. For example, ‘pattern recognition’   venture capitalists assessing potential start- ups based on whether their founders resem- ble  successful  entrepreneurs  in  terms  of  gender, race, nationality, and education  and  ‘cultural  fit’   one’s  ability  to  blend  in  with  work  cultures  dominated  by  young  white  and  Asian  men   contribute  to  gender  and  race  inequality  in American  startups,  which  in turn affects which technologies are devel- oped and how target markets and user bases  are conceptualized.  The californian ideology and  The hisTory of silicon valley  Social media is more popular than ever. Two- thirds  of Americans  use  social  media  sites,  up  from  only  7%  ten  years  ago   Perrin,  2015 . According  to  the  Global Web  Index,  there  are  approximately  2.3  billion  user  accounts on social media services, represent- ing 31% of the world’s population  Chaffey,  2016 . And much of this social media, with  the  significant  exception  of  that  popular  in  China,2  in  Northern  California.  According  to  Forbes,  65  out  of  174 of the ‘unicorns’ of the tech industry –  privately-owned startups worth more than $1  billion  US  –  are  based  in  California.  They  include social media sites Snapchat, Pinterest,  Nextdoor,  and  Slack,  and  social  media-  adjacent  companies  like AirBnB,  Uber,  and  Buzzfeed  Nusca, 2016 .  Of the rest, 42 are  in China, 41 elsewhere in the United States,   is  headquartered   19 in Europe, and eight in India; the rest are  spread  around  the  world   CrunchBase,  2016  .  San  Francisco  and  Silicon  Valley  represent more than 70% of US venture capi- tal  investment,  most  of  it  in  software   Massaro, 2016 . While San Francisco faces  skyrocketing rents and a very visible home- less  population,  engineers  at  startups  like  Twitter, Facebook, Uber, and Slack are paid  six-figure  salaries,  fed  free  healthy  meals  three  times  a  day,  and  shuttled  to  and  from  work  in  private  buses  via  Bay  Area  high- ways. As a result, the greater Silicon Valley  area has lower unemployment, lower poverty  rates,  and  higher  wages  than  the  rest  of  the  United States  Massaro, 2016 .  Santa Clara County, also known as Silicon  Valley, encompasses the cities of Palo Alto,  Mountain  View,  Cupertino,  Sunnyvale,  and  San Jose. It is one of the United States’ eco- nomic centers, with a long history of gener- ating  wealth  from  technological  innovation,  from  transistors  and  micro-computers  to  video  games,  multimedia,  and  dot-com  companies  Saxenian, 1996; English-Lueck,  2002 . Silicon Valley proper boasts a diverse  population  with  skilled  immigrants,  expen- sive  real  estate,  well-funded  public  schools,  and technological saturation  English-Lueck,  2002:  11 .  Its  political  sensibility  is  of  a  decidedly libertarian bent, emphasizing self- directed improvement, a belief in meritocracy  and social mobility, and a lack of ‘work-life  balance’  Rogers and Larsen, 1984; Bronson,  2000; Borsook, 2001; English-Lueck, 2002 .  The  mix  of  ethnic  diversity  and  higher- than-average  technology  use  has  created  an  image of Silicon Valley as ultra-modern and  representative  of  the  future.  English-Lueck  writes, ‘The things that make Silicon Valley  distinctive – its technological saturation and  complex range of identities – are not merely  interesting  cultural  artifacts  in  themselves.  They are significant because both the perva- siveness of technology and identity diversity  are  coming  to  define  the  emerging  global  culture’   2002:  8 .  Today,  Silicon  Valley  is  not  only  synonymous  with  the  technology    siliCon valley and the soCial Media industry   317  companies  located  there,  such  as  Apple,  Facebook, Google, and Yahoo, but has grown  to include nearby San Francisco, which has  historically been hipper, younger, and wilder  than its more conservative southern suburbs   Marwick, 2013 .  In  From  Counterculture  to  Cyberculture,  cultural  historian  Fred  Turner  traced  dense  ties between 1960s counterculture movements  like the New Communalists and the computer  pioneers  of  Northern  California   Turner,  2005,  2006;  see  also  Markoff,  2005 .  This  parallel history of both venture-backed capi- talism and radical anti-establishmentarianism  precipitated a discourse popularly known as  ‘The  Californian  Ideology’   Barbrook  and  Cameron,  1996 .  The  Californian  Ideology  holds that an increase in computer technolo- gies brings positive social consequences, that  entrepreneurial  technology  culture  rewards  the smartest and the hardest workers, and that  universal prosperity is best pursued through  an unfettered free market. In previous work,  I argued that the ethos of social media simi- larly combines countercultural ideology and  neoliberal  capitalism,  positioning  partici- patory  technology  as  the  solution  to  failing  institutions  Marwick, 2013 . Drawing from  such  disparate  sources  as  the  hacker  ethic,  Do-It-Yourself  punk  rock,  zines,  and  2000s  anti-capitalist  activism,  the  discourse  of  ‘Web 2.0’ identified Big Media as failing and  faulty, and positioned social technologies as  a  more  egalitarian  alternative.  When  com- bined with Silicon Valley’s strong foundation  in libertarianism, free market capitalism, and  venture-backed  startups,  social  media  begat  a somewhat unholy alliance that emphasized  the  entrepreneur,  the  celebrity,  or  the  brand  as  a  model  of  subjectivity  to  combat  eco- nomic woes – in other words, the incursion  of  economic  principles  into  the  most  per- sonal  regions  of  selfhood  and  interpersonal  relationships.  In its function as a global imaginary, Silicon  Valley exports the Californian Ideology as a  universal solution to localized problems. This  project  is  articulated  in  various  ways,  some   more  overt  than  others.  For  instance,  else- where  in  this  volume,  Siva  Vaidhyanathan  discusses Facebook’s ‘Free Basics’ program,  which  provided  mobile  users  in  India  with  access  to  a  limited  number  of  Facebook- selected websites. Facebook ignored the local  context and the Indian software and telecom- munications industry in favor of a simplistic  model of social change which presumed that  access  to  information  would  intrinsically  empower poor Indian people. Unsurprisingly,  such an effort was criticized by Indian activ- ists and media as tone-deaf and reminiscent  of  colonialism.  However,  in  many  places,  social media technologies built in the United  States  have  become  deeply  tied  into  local  histories and cultures. As Miller et al. argue  in their comparative analysis of social media  use in eleven different countries, south Indian  families,  Chinese  migrant  workers,  south- eastern Turkish teenagers, and adults in rural  Chile use social media quite differently based  on  local  norms,  geographies,  and  histories   Miller et al., 2016 . Social media is articu- lated and experienced locally, but, as we shall  see, the fantasy of technological solutionism  is often taken up by countries and regions as  a way to fiat economic success   Bresnahan,  Gambardella,  and  Saxenian,  2001;  Engel,  2014 .  Beyond overt emulation of Silicon Valley  by industries and governments, the media vis- ibility and idealization of successful Northern  California tech companies like Snapchat and  Instagram have birthed a world-wide fan base  that  follows  the  business  developments  and  social  machinations  of  the  scene  through  Hacker  News,  blogs,  and  Twitter  feeds.  San  Francisco  functions  as  a  mythic  center  for  entrepreneurs,  academics,  and  venture  capitalists  across  the  world,  who  imagine  themselves to be connected through technol- ogy, and thus beyond place, but still ground  themselves in the Californian Ideology of the  Bay  Area.  Social  media  workers  from  San  Francisco,  New York,  Tokyo,  Paris, Austin,  and  London  stay  in  close  touch  via  instant  messenger, Slack, and social media, touching    318  base at conferences and industry events, often  forging strong personal and professional rela- tionships between people who only meet in  person  once  a  year.  SV  therefore  functions  as  a  shared  set  of  assumptions,  beliefs,  and  norms  interests  across  geographical  boundaries   Marwick,  2013 .  that  maintains  common   myThs of silicon valley  The tech industry is governed by a series of  myths  that  function  to  justify  the  political  economy  of  the  technology  industry:  open- ness,  meritocracy,  and  entrepreneurialism.  As I outline below, they are rooted in a par- ticularly  American,  and  even  more  specifi- cally  Northern  Californian,  set  of  presumptions;  they  do  not  always  function  seamlessly when ported to another context.  Openness  ‘Openness’  is  an  umbrella  term  for  projects  that  emphasize  collaboration,  participation,  and transparent governance, as in open-access  journals  or  open-source  software.  Lilly  Nguyen  describes  openness  as  ‘a  habituated  moral view with particular aesthetics and sen- sibilities … technologies are seen as open in  their ability to generate the creation and pro- duction  of  new  technical  products,  to  enable  the  continuous  circulation  of  these  products,  and to foster use and consumption independ- ent  of  technical  expertise’   2016:  640 .  In  other words, openness is framed as desirable  because it allows anyone to participate, foster- ing democratic involvement and boosting the  tech industry’s belief in itself as meritocratic.  As Nathaniel Tkacz  2014  argues in his study  of Wikipedia,  while  openness  purports  to  be  apolitical, this in itself is a political move, in  that  it  sidesteps  questions  of  inequality  or  power  asymmetry.  Indeed,  most  ‘open’  pro- jects  are,  in  reality,  not  particularly  open,  as   participation  inevitably  leads  to  hierarchy.  Wikipedia, for instance, has a heavily striated  structure  of  involvement,  and  those  who  are  the most successful at navigating it are those  able  to  convincingly  manipulate  its  intricate  body  of  rules   Tkacz,  2014 .  It  is  also  over- whelmingly male-dominated.  The  value  of  openness  is  also  linked  to  a  pleasurable,  creative  technical  practice,  which  is  acutely  contextual  to  American  internet culture. In her ethnographic work on  technical practice in Vietnam, Lilly Nguyen  discusses jailbreaking iPhones, which, in the  Global North, is typically characterized as ‘a  moral commitment to generativity, openness,  and  transgressive  self-expression’   2016:  640 . However, during the time of Nguyen’s  fieldwork  there  was  no  service  provider  in  Vietnam  who  could  legally  provide  iPhone  service.  Thus,  purchasing  an  iPhone  from  abroad  and  jailbreaking  it  for  personal  use  represented a connection to a global techno- culture, as well as a status symbol of moder- nity  and  luxury.  While  Northern  hackers  might see jailbreaking as a way to protest the  ‘tethered’ system of Apple products  Zittrain,  2008 , Vietnamese people saw it as a way to  connect to the same system.  What this all presupposes, however, is that  openness is still valued, which may be true in  Western hacker or activist communities, but  no longer seems true in the technology indus- try per se. ‘Openness’ is an ideal not neces- sarily of the tech industry as it exists today,  but  one  left  over  from  its  previous  iteration  as  ‘Web  2.0’   Marwick,  2015 .  Most  social  media  sites  and  apps   Facebook,  Twitter,  Instagram,  Snapchat   are  ‘walled  gardens’  which  deliberately  make  it  difficult  to  port  data  from  one  platform  to  another  –  try  exporting your Instagram photos to Snapchat,  for instance – and use a number of techniques  to keep users from clicking away from their  site  or  switching  to  another  application.3  Proprietary technologies, from Apple laptops  to wearables, are designed to facilitate ‘lock  in’ to a particular system and make it diffi- cult for people to move from one to another,    siliCon valley and the soCial Media industry   319  so  as  not  to  lose  audience  and  therefore  ad  sales.  Platform  content  is  often  curated  and  organized  by  algorithms  and,  sometimes,  human editors; determining the logic behind  this  creation  is  similarly  black-boxed  and  difficult  Eslami et al., 2016 . Openness is a  vestigial remnant of Web 2.0, but is increas- ingly  irrelevant  in  the  eyeball-driven  world  of  modern  social  media  ‘content.’  Thus,  it  demonstrates  how  the  political  economy  of  the   advertisement-driven  web  is  extinguish- ing any ideals of libertarian tech culture that  are  incompatible.  Despite  this,  several  of  the  practices,  like  hackathons  and  Startup  Weekends discussed later in this chapter, are  open:  since  their  basic  structure  is  widely  available  online,  anyone  with  the  available  resources can host one, and in theory anyone  can attend. Within these contexts, freely shar- ing ideas and resources is not only normative,  but  explicitly  taught  to  participants.  Thus,  openness  is  pedagogically  reproduced,  even  if its value largely remains ideological.  Meritocracy  The term ‘meritocracy’ was coined by sociol- ogist Michael Young in a 1958 satirical essay.  Young described a dystopian Britain in which  social  class  –  status  ascribed  by  birth  –  had  withered away, to be replaced by social status  achieved through education. Young was con- cerned that educational reforms would make  it impossible for the working class to achieve  high-up political positions, and instead strat- ify elitism so that the wealthy and powerful  were  also  seen  as  the  most  ‘deserving.’  He  was  dismayed  to  see  the  word  taken  up  enthusiastically  –  and  non-ironically  –  by  Tony  Blair  and  his  neoliberal  New  Labour  party,  bringing  about  the  very  dystopia  he  was  attempting  to  guard  against   Young,  2001 .  Meritocracy  in  its  modern  usage  refers to the idea that people will be judged  not on their gender, race, or background, but  solely  on  their  intelligence  and  talents.  In  other words, you get out of the system what   you put into it. Meritocracy is the underlying  ideology  of  the  American  dream,  which  holds  that  each  person  can  advance  profes- sionally and economically according to his or  her merit. The ideal that the United States is  a  meritocracy  is  linked  to  its  origin  as  a  nation of immigrants, and stands in opposi- tion to European birthright based on heredi- tary  aristocracies   McNamee  and  Miller,  2009 .  Despite  considerable  research  showing  that economic assets in the USA are not dis- tributed according to merit, the term persists,  particularly  in  Silicon  Valley  and  the  tech  industry  in  general   Shih,  2006;  English- Lueck,  2011;  Bacon,  2013 .  Meritocracy  functions to justify the immense inequity of  wealth distribution in the technology indus- try, as its logical conclusion is that those who  are  worth  millions,  or  even  billions,  of  dol- lars  are  the  smartest  or  the  hardest-working   Marwick,  2013 .  It  also  provides  a  reason  for the lack of African-American and Latino  men,  and  women  of  all  races   particularly  women  of  color   in  the  industry:  this  dis- course  holds  that  they  are  simply  not  inter- ested, or not skilled enough, to compete with  white and Asian men.  In  reality,  Silicon  Valley  does  not  at  all  function as a meritocracy. Women are treated  differently  from  men:  they  are  subject  to  more  harassment  at  work;  they  are  left  out  of  male-dominated  mentoring  networks;  they are promoted less; their roles as moth- ers  or  care  providers  are  seen  as  incompat- ible with the fast-paced world of technology;  and  their  failures  are  seen  as  representative  of their gender rather than individual   Cech  and Blair-Loy, 2010; Hui, 2014 . Moreover,  practices  like  hiring  based  on  ‘culture  fit’  exclude people who don’t enjoy or who have  aged-out of the college dorm atmosphere of  startups.  Venture  capitalists  employ  what  they  call  ‘pattern  recognition’  to  determine  who to fund, prioritizing entrepreneurs who  look  like  people  they’ve  previously  funded,  excluding  founders  and  products  that  don’t  fit  into  a  particular   raced  and  gendered     320  archetype. In Johanna Shih’s qualitative study  of Silicon Valley workers, white women and  Asian  men  and  women  experienced  wide- spread  gender  and  ethnic  discrimination.  They  used  job-hopping  to  circumvent  bias:  white  women  moved  to  companies  recog- nized as good for women or to bigger com- panies  with  better  work-life  balance; Asian  men  and  women  joined  minority-owned  firms  or  started  their  own  companies   Shih,  2006 . In my own research in San Francisco,  I found that women’s accomplishments were  systemically  undervalued,  whereas  their  appearance and relationships with men were  emphasized   Marwick,  2013 .  Indeed,  bias  in the tech industry, whether based on race,  gender, or geography, is significant, endemic,  and structural.  As  an  explanation  for  social  inequality,  meritocracy justifies and reproduces inequal- ity, and makes invisible its structural nature,  precluding policy-making or other challenges  to  systemic  inequity   Cech  and  Blair-Loy,  2010: 372 . In other words, Silicon Valley’s  insistence that it is a home for the ‘best and  the brightest’ and that those who don’t suc- ceed there simply aren’t good enough masks  very real barriers to entry and success.  Entrepreneurialism  The valorization of entrepreneurship may be  the most cherished of Silicon Valley myths.  The  entrepreneur  is  a  breed  apart  from  normal men and women; he is fueled by pas- sion and independence, with a deep desire to  ‘change  the  world.’  Like  Steve  Jobs  and  Mark Zuckerberg, he is also usually a white  guy in jeans and sneakers. The entrepreneur  is  also  a  key  figure  in  the  neoliberal  para- digm.  Sarah  Banet-Weiser  and  Marita  Sturken, in their study of street artist Shepard  Fairey,  write  ‘the  entrepreneur  …  is  under- stood as an ambitious individual, dependent  on  no  one  but  him herself,  a  person  who  “owns”  his  or  her  own  labor  and  is  thus  accountable  for  not  only  profit  but  risks   accumulated by this labor’  2010: 273 . The  entrepreneur  is  presented  as  a  subject  posi- tion which anyone can and should step into. Daniel Cockayne argues that this romanti- cized  concept  of  entrepreneurship  is  simply  an  emotional  attachment  that  justifies  eco- nomic  uncertainty.  In  other  words,  in  order  to rationalize the long hours, hard work, and  negligible rewards of starting a company, one  must have an emotional attachment to entre- preneurialism.  Talking  about  being  ‘driven’  or having a ‘passion’ for one’s work excuses  the obvious downsides  Cockayne, 2015 . He  writes:  Affect functions through entrepreneurial forms of  digital  media  work  to  produce  and  reproduce  attachments  to  normative   and  often  precarious   working  conditions.  These  affective  attachments  reinforce  a  privileged  idea  about  what  work  ‘should be’, and how work ought to be practiced  despite potentially deleterious effects on individu- als’  earning  capacity,  physical  and  mental  health,  and  ‘life’  as  a  category  broadly  conceived.   Cockayne, 2015: 3   In  my  earlier  work,  I  found  that  even  if  employees at early stage startups were work- ing  under  difficult,  stressful,  or  uncertain  working  conditions,  with  only  a  vague  pos- sibility  of  success,  they  espoused  platitudes  of  loving  their  job  and  changing  the  world.  Being  an  entrepreneur  was  much  higher-  status than existing as a rank-and-file worker  at Twitter or Facebook, even if the latter was  much  better  paid.  For  the  self-styled  entre- preneur,  working  for  others  was  anxiety- producing and unsatisfying.  This sense of entrepreneurial value extends  beyond founding a company. Having personal  projects  demonstrates  initiative  and  creativ- ity. Participating in the larger community of  technology enthusiasts, whether founding an  event  or  developing  an  open-source  tool,  is  highly  respected  in  Silicon  Valley,  demon- strating ‘community citizenship, generalized  reciprocity, moral obligation, and pro-social  behavior’   Tedjamulia  et  al.,  2005 ,  traits  that  are  valued  in  many  technology  com- munities  that  prize  information-sharing  and    siliCon valley and the soCial Media industry   321  collaboration.  Similarly,  contributing  to  free  or  open-source  software  projects  dem- onstrates  that  the  creator  is  technologically  savvy, creative, and not motivated by money.  But obviously not everyone can be an entre- preneur; all industries are comprised of levels  of laborers, and those who do not run a com- pany, or even know how to code, often live  precariously without economic or social sta- bility – such as the Uber driver. The emphasis  on the entrepreneur obscures inequalities and  exploitation  within  the  neoliberal  system  of  labor.  silicon valley as global  imaginary  Silicon Valley  is  a  ‘technopole,’  or  a  model  for technologically-aspiring regions  Castells  and Hall, 1994 . However, it is not enough to  simply  emulate  software  development  or  technology  manufacturing;  what  must  be  emulated is the process of entrepreneurship.  Jerome Engel writes that while SV functions  as  an  exemplar  for  innovation-based  eco- nomic  development  worldwide,  often  sup- ported by local governments and businesses,  this is not always successful:  It  is  widely  touted  that  the  right  combination  of  factors  and  policies  can  unleash  the  inherent  entrepreneurial  capacity  of  society,  energize  indi- vidual  initiative,  and  create  individual  and  collec- tive  benefit.  However,  the  success  of  efforts  to  create innovation clusters has been uneven at best,  and  the  regional  economic  scene  is  littered  with  Silicon Valley imitators.  Engel, 2014: 36   These imitators, or siliconia, include Silicon  Alley  in  New  York,  Silicon  Gulf  in  the  Philippines,  Silicon  Wadi  in  Israel,  Silicon  Saxony,  Cwm  Silicon  in  Wales,  Silicon  Beach,  Silicon  Corridor,  and  Silicon  Prairie   Dawson,  2001;  Wikipedia  Contributors,  2009 .  Engel  writes  that  to  be  successful,  a  ‘Cluster of Innovation’ must include univer- sities,  government  support,  VCs,  entrepre- neurs,  investors,  and  a  host  of  specialized   service providers and professional resources,  not to mention an emphasis on mobility and  networking   Engel,  2014:  38 .  Indeed,  Silicon  Valley  has  a  rich  infrastructure  of  people, capital, and material developed over  a 70-year history, and is thus extremely dif- ficult to replicate  Lécuyer, 2006 .  In  their  literature  review  of  digital  entre- preneurship  in  Latin  America,  Quinones,  Nicholson, and Heeks  2015 explain that while  policymakers and private investors throughout  Latin  America  have  supported  a  number  of  initiatives designed to increase the number of  technology  startups,  such  as  Mexico  Digital,  Startup Chile, and Brazil Startup, these have  mostly  been  unsuccessful.  While  they  argue  that the lack of research on the Latin American  context makes it difficult to tell exactly what  has prevented this success, it seems clear that  much of it is contextual. The entrepreneurial  infrastructure  of  Silicon  Valley  is  charac- terized  by  ‘incubators,  spin-offs,  informal  networks,  formal  networks,  physical  infra- structure, and culture’  Quinones et al., 2015:  192 .  However,  as  Daniel  Isenberg  observes  in a popular Harvard Business Review article   2010 ,  outside  the  United  States,  successful  entrepreneurial ecosystems have a different set  of characteristics. Indeed, attempting to emu- late  Silicon Valley  is  impossible;  not  only  is  it a magnet for entrepreneurs who move there  from all over the world, it has an ‘overabun- dance of technology and technical expertise’  that requires ‘generations’ to create. He writes:  Even Silicon Valley could not become itself today if  it tried. Its ecosystem evolved under a unique set  of circumstances: a strong local aerospace industry,  the  open  California  culture,  Stanford  University’s  supportive  relationships  with  industry,  a  mother  lode of invention from Fairchild Semiconductor, a  liberal  immigration  policy  toward  doctoral  stu- dents,  and  pure  luck,  among  other  things.  All  those factors set off a chaotic evolution that defies  definitive  determination  of  cause  and  effect.   Isenberg, 2010: 3   Instead of imitating Silicon Valley, Isenberg  argues  that  entrepreneurial  ecosystems  should be shaped around local conditions. He    322  says  that  Israel’s  successful  startup  culture,  for  instance,  ‘evolved  haphazardly  out  of  a  combination  of  factors,  including  spillover  from large military R&D efforts, strong dias- pora  connections  to  capital  and  customers,  and a culture that prized frugality, education,  and  unconventional  wisdom’   Isenberg,  2010: 4 .4  Despite this, the desire to emulate Silicon  Valley,  its  wealth,  and  its  young,  rock  star  entrepreneurs, remains strong. There is a folk  belief in what Lilly Irani calls entrepreneurial  citizenship: a model of selfhood ‘celebrated  in  transnational  cultures  that  orient  toward  Silicon Valley  for  models  of  social  change’   2015:  3 .  She  writes  that  ‘work  practices  associated  with  software  production  have  come  to  signify  collaboration,  voluntarism,  optimism,  and  wealth,  tested  in  software  practice and ready to enter new domains of  public life’  2015: 2 . In other words, certain  symbolic  rituals  and  ideologies  of  modern  software development are linked not only to  financial success, but to an optimistic model  of progressive production. In the next section,  I look at how certain practices of the technol- ogy  scene  –  Startup Weekends,  hackathons,  accelerators  and  incubators  –  are  replicated  world-wide in an attempt to spread the ‘soft  skills’ that make up Silicon Valley.  Emulating Silicon Valley  In his study of Brazilian software developers,  Yuri  Takhteyev  argues  that  to  understand  how globalization functions, we must exam- ine ‘worlds of practice’ – ‘systems of activi- ties comprised of people, ideas, and material  objects,  linked  simultaneously  by  shared  meanings  and  joint  projects’   2012:  2 .  Software development as a whole is certainly  one of these worlds of practice, consisting of  a shared set of values, technical knowledge,  code,  documentation,  and  the  daily  practice  of creating software. Obviously, robust soft- ware  industries  exist  world-wide.  In  coun- tries  like  China,  Taiwan  and  Israel,  with   mature software industries, the ‘brain circu- lation’   Saxenian,  2006   of  engineers  who  move to Silicon Valley to work, gain exper- tise in work practice, and then return to their  home  companies  complete  with  contempo- rary development practices, has been deeply  influential.  Beyond  just  software  develop- ment, however, much of the ‘soft infrastruc- ture’  Haines, 2014a: 282  of Silicon Valley  exists as a separate world of practice. More  recent  practices  identified  with  venture- backed  startups  that  blur  the  lines  between  work,  play,  and  self,  are  deployed  world- wide in a strategic attempt by institutions to  attempt  to  create  ‘a  culture  of  collaboration  and innovation’  Cervantes and Nardi, 2012:  5 .  These  practices  are  quite  different  from  those of software development proper.  For  instance,  the  SV  nonprofit  ‘Startup  Weekend,’  owned  and  operated  by  the  accelerator  TechStars,  conducts  workshops  around  the  globe  teaching  local  would-be  entrepreneurs  about  the  culture  of  Silicon  Valley  startups.  Startup  Weekend  brings  engineers,  entrepreneurs,  venture  capital- ists,  and  educational  institutions  together  in  an  attempt  to  create  what  SV  refers  to  as  an  ‘ecosystem’  –  a  ‘network  of  people,  institutions,  and  resources  needed  to  build  startups’   Cervantes  and  Nardi,  2012:  7 .  In  their  ethnography  of  a  Mexican  Startup  Weekend,  Cervantes  and  Nardi  argue  that  Mexico’s  software  industry  is  characterized  by  service  and  manufacturing,  and  Startup  Weekend is an attempt to create the type of  ‘startup companies that build innovative soft- ware products with global impact’  2012: 1 .  At Startup Weekend, Mexican entrepreneurs  decry what they see as a risk-averse, distrust- ful, and non-collaborative local culture, and  attempt to embrace the resourceful and col- laborative  spirit  of  Silicon Valley.  It  seems,  however, that the spirit of SV leaks through  in more ways than one; one team gets angry  when  their  idea  for  a  ‘social  network  for  cats’ is pitched by another team. The Startup  Weekend mentors calm them down, explain- ing  that  there  are  many  social  networks  for    siliCon valley and the soCial Media industry   323  pets,  and  that  execution  matters  more  than  just  ideas.  One  might  question  whether  a  social network for pets is the type of innova- tive product with global impact that will help  transform  Mexican  industry;  SV  values  and  practices do not, in themselves, produce pro- gressive solutions.  Another type of ‘soft infrastructure’ is the  accelerator,  a  ‘bootcamp  for  startups’  where  cohorts of small startups are mentored by suc- cessful  entrepreneurs.5  Small  startups  apply  to join an accelerator, which accepts classes  or  cohorts  of  startups  which  go  through  a  program for a fixed amount of time, and are  provided with seed funding from the accelera- tor in exchange for equity, as part of a global  network of venture capital funding. The goal  of accelerators is for their alumni to get VC  funding and eventually ‘exit,’ either through  acquisition by a larger, wealthier company or  with an Initial Public Offering  IPO . Because  the  accelerator  takes  a  percentage  of  such  exits, their success is judged by the monetary  value of their alumni companies’ exits. Some  highly successful startups, including AirBnB,  Reddit,  Uber,  and  Taskrabbit,  are  accelera- tor  alumni.  Outside  the  USA,  there  are  an  estimated  200  accelerators  in  33  countries  worldwide;  Haines  observed  accelerators  in  Singapore and Buenos Aires. She argues that  these  accelerators  function  as  institutions  that  reproduce  the  social  order  of  startups,  providing  young  companies  with  funding,  networking opportunities, and, perhaps most  importantly,  an  acculturation  into  startup  norms  and  communities  of  practice  which,  of  course,  are  based  on  those  of  Silicon  Valley   Haines,  2014b .  In  the  accelerators  she observed, she found that there were often  cultural  differences  between  the  startup  best  practices  taught  by  the  accelerator  and  the  norms of the local community. For instance,  a  Vietnamese  startup  quit  their  accelerator  because they were uncomfortable with cold- calling potential investors  2014b: 292 .  In  her  research  on  hackathons  –  intense,  focused  coding  sessions  held  over  multiple  days, in which small teams of programmers   create software prototypes – Lilly Irani argues  that  such  events  are  significant  not  because  they produce software  although they some- times do , but because they produce subjects:  They manufacture urgency and an optimism that  bursts of doing and making can change the world.  Participants  in  hackathons  imagine  themselves  as  agents  of  social  progress  through  software,  and  these middle-class efforts to remake culture draw  legitimacy from the global prestige of technology  industry work practices.  Irani, 2015: 2   To the middle-class Indian coders that Irani  studied,  hackathons  primarily  promoted  entrepreneurialism.  Just  as  the  Mexican  Startup Weekend reified Silicon Valley as an  ideal  model  for  economic  development  in  Mexico,  the  ‘open  governance’  hackathon  extolled  a  model  of  social  change  based  in  Northern  California  as  a  way  for  India  to  develop nationally and progress globally. For  participants, the hackathon, and its emphasis  on  ‘design  and  social  entrepreneurship’   Irani,  2015:  8 ,  was  a  way  to  differentiate  public sector development, which they char- acterized  as  slow  and  deliberative,  from   forward-thinking,  market-driven  solutions.  The  hackathon  ‘prescribed  entrepreneurial- ism as a cure for ailments of global capital- ism’   2015:  9 .  Given  that  at  the  time,  however,  only  about  10  percent  of  Indians  had internet access, a web-based solution to  problems  of  governance  would  require  the  participation of NGOs and pre-existing activ- ist  networks.  Despite  their  ideals,  Irani’s  participants were unable to finish a demo in  time, and the project went nowhere.  In other places, entrepreneurs were able to  translate  SV  work  practices  into  their  local  contexts with more success. Ali Mohajerani,  Baptista,  and  Nandhakumar   2015   stud- ied  both  innovative  and  traditional  IT  com- panies  in  Iran  to  examine  the  influence  of  Western social media on entrepreneurs. They  found that the innovative firms, which ‘used  social  media  extensively  to  connect  with  others  and  learn  new  ways  of  doing  busi- ness,’  Mohajerani et al., 2015: 23  used the    324  internet  to  learn  about  the  products,  work  practices,  and  values  of  companies  like  Google, Twitter, and Facebook. Rather, how- ever, than adopting these practices intact, IT  entrepreneurs  ‘localized  practices  and  mod- els,  adding  some  features  specific  to  their  own contexts’  2015: 24 . These innovations  included  American  products  like  Dropbox  and  Google  Apps,  but  also  work  practices  like  ‘working  from  home’  and  prioritizing  ‘openness’  as  a  company  value.  This  was  in sharp contrast to more traditional Iranian  companies, which adhered to traditional val- ues  of  family  and  religion,  avoided  the  use  of social media  much of which is prohibited  by  the  Iranian  government ,  and  required  employees to work in the office  2015: 24 .  The  freely  available  resources  online,  from  message  boards  to  MOOCs,  and  the  use  of  low-overhead,  free  or  cheap  collaboration  technologies,  helped  the  innovative  compa- nies  grow  faster  and  be  more  economically  successful  than  their  more  traditional  coun- terparts.  In  turn,  this  success  spawned  local  Iranian  communities,  websites,  and  partner- ships, especially in centers like Tehran. Thus,  Iranian  technology  startups,  in  many  ways,  modeled themselves after successful Silicon  Valley companies, ‘portraying themselves as  modern  and  innovative  enterprises,  emulat- ing  the  best-practice  management  of  global  corporates’  2015: 25 . However, these prac- tices  were  translated  and  contextualized  to  the  local  context.  It  was  the  creativity  and  drive  of  Iranian  entrepreneurs,  not  just  the  affordances of American social media, which  led to these transformations.  conclusion  While programmers and entrepreneurs world- wide  still  attempt  to  emulate  Silicon Valley,  the bloom is off the rose. Silicon Valley in the  early  twenty-first  century  exists  both  as  something to mimic and something to parody.  In New York, the ‘Stupid Shit No One Needs   and  Terrible  Ideas  Hackathon’  mocked  the  propensity of the tech industry to tackle sys- temic problems like climate change through  weekends  spent  building  wearables  and  coding mobile apps. Categories like ‘artisanal  ad networks,’ ‘3D printed drugs’ and ‘Using  Slack to Raise Your Children’ spawned pro- jects such as ‘Unfriend the Poors,’ a plug-in  that determines the wealth of your Facebook  friends  and  then  allows  you  to  delete  those  who do not meet your socio-economic stand- ards   inspired  by  a  very  real  patent  filed  by  Facebook that would use the social graph to  determine  Facebook  user’s  credit  risk ;  YOUrinate,  a  wearable  that  tells  its  user  when  they  have  to  pee;  and,  infamously,  Soylent Dick, a phallus made out of the meal  replacement  powder  that  shoots  out  Soylent  when  a  phrase  from  the  Soylent  creator  is  typed  in   Lavigne  and  Winger-Bearskin,  2016 .  Co-founder  Sam  Levigne  told  Vice  magazine, ‘Is a need being filled [by Silicon  Valley] or is the need manufactured and then  constantly reinforced?’  D’Anastasio, 2016 .  In  entertainment  media,  the  HBO  show  Silicon Valley takes broad shots at the nerdy,  male-dominated culture where founders brag  about being part of the ‘three comma club’ –  worth  a  billion  dollars  –  and  hold  meetings  on  bikes.  Movies  like  The  Social  Network  and  Steve  Jobs  depict  tech  entrepreneurs  as  ruthless  and  socially  challenged.  The  novel  The Circle, by Dave Eggers  2013 , depicts a  dystopian world controlled by an unholy alli- ance  of  Facebook,  Google,  and  Twitter.  Despite the tech industry’s massive financial  success and uptake among regular Americans,  its excesses and eccentricities are more visi- ble than before.  Indeed,  San  Francisco  has  become  the  center  of  the  country’s  debate  about  eco- nomic inequality, as the salary paid to tech- nology  workers,  a  lack  of  new  affordable  housing,  and  a  constant  increase  in  popula- tion displaced working people, activists, and  artists  from  their  neighborhoods  and  homes   Bort,  2015 .  The  tech  industry  functions  as a lightning rod for discontent over rising    siliCon valley and the soCial Media industry   325  rents and gentrification, with protesters con- fronting  private  shuttle  buses  provided  by  Google,  Facebook  and  Apple   LA  Times  Editorial  Board,  2014 . Wealthy  tech  work- ers fueled the fire by visibly confronting the  city’s  homeless  population.  ‘I  know  people  are frustrated about gentrification happening  in the city, but the reality is, we live in a free  market society,’ wrote Justin Keller, founder  of  a  startup  that  makes  it  easier  to  manage  data  servers.  ‘The  wealthy  working  people  have earned their right to live in the city. … I  shouldn’t have to see the pain, struggle, and  despair of homeless people to and from my  way to work every day’  Keller, 2016 . Greg  Gopman, founder of a company which organ- izes hackathons, posted on Facebook that ‘In  downtown  SF  the  degenerates  gather  like  hyenas,  spit,  urinate,  taunt  you,  sell  drugs,  get rowdy, they act like they own the center  of the city. Like it’s their place of leisure. …  In actuality it’s the business district for one  of  the  wealthiest  cities  in  the  USA.  It  [sic]  a disgrace’  Biddle, 2013 . Publicly shamed  for his post, a year later he proposed solving  homelessness  by  building  geodesic  domes  housing  ‘community  transition  centers’  for  shelter  and  ‘personal  development  classes  from  computer  programming  to  life  coach- ing’  A Better San Francisco, 2015 . To date,  not a single transition center has been built.  Indeed, it’s been a rough few years for the  American tech industry. Not only have tech  startups  been  subject  to  relentless  criticism  as  the  poster  children  for  income  inequal- ity,  misogyny,  and  bro-y  cluelessness,  but  venture  funding  has  dropped  precipitously,  and  with  it,  the  go-go  conspicuousness  of  the Web 2.0 era  Samuel and Sanwal, 2016;  Zaleski, 2016 . ‘It’s no longer cool to throw  a  fifty-thousand-dollar  party  to  celebrate  your  launch,’  a  recent  SF  transplant  told  me,  complaining  that  the  city’s  nightlife  was  sorely  lacking  compared  to  New York.  Social media itself is cluttered with advertis- ing  and  peppered  throughout  with  tracking  software, as apps and websites mine personal  data  and  sell  it  to  brokers   Angwin,  2014 ;   even  the  least  savvy  users  are  beginning  to  notice  that  visiting  a  website  for  slippers  will  cause  said  slippers  to  appear,  as  if  by  magic,  on  every  site  that  you  subsequently  browse.  On  Facebook,  Instagram,  and,  per- haps soon, Twitter, the News Feed displays  only  a  sub-set  of  your  Friends’  posts,  gen- erated  algorithmically  based  on  what  the  company  believes  will  make  you  the  least  likely  to  leave  the  site.  Once  lauded  for  its  facilitation  of  increased  cultural  participa- tion and democracy, social media now looks  like nothing as much as the endless cycle of  consumer want depicted in M. T. Anderson’s  2002 dystopic YA novel Feed:  But the braggest thing about the feed, the thing  that makes it really big, is that it knows everything  you  want  and  hope  for,  sometimes  before  you  even know what those things are. It can tell you  how to get them, and help you make buying deci- sions that are hard. Everything we think and feel is  taken in by the corporations … and they can get  to know what it is we need, so all you have to do  is want something and there’s a chance it will be  yours.  Anderson, 2002: 40   We must, then, consider the impact of Silicon  Valley  on  the  development  of  technology:  where Silicon Valley is understood not just as  a  physical  place  but  as  a  set  of  practices,  ideologies,  and  beliefs.  If  these  ideologies  are uneasily compatible with social equality,  yet are plugged as solutions to economic dif- ficulties, what happens to them in other con- texts? As we have seen, they often fail. But  we  may  consider  whether  we  want  them  to  succeed at all.  Notes  1   While an alternative model exists in the form of  the  networked,  non-profit  collaborative  culture  of  free libre open-source  software,  FLOSS  proj- ects rarely result in popular social media, with the  notable exception of Wikipedia. See Gehl, Chap- ter 18 this volume, for more.   2   China has a very active social media population  and an extremely robust startup sector. Generally  US  tech  companies  have  a  difficult  time  mak- ing inroads. The Chinese social media industry is    326   worthy of more attention than I can devote to it  in this chapter. For more on Chinese social media,  see  Fuchs   2016 ,  McDonald   2016   and  Wang   2016 .   3   This shift has been vigorously resisted in Europe,  culminating  in  the  passage  of  a  ‘right  to  data  portability’ as part of the European Union’s Gen- eral  Data  Protection  Regulation   GDPR   passed  in  April  2016;  it  remains  to  be  seen  how  social  media  platforms  will  respond  to  this  imperative   Burton et al., 2016 .   4   The  Israeli  government  proactively  supported  a   venture-capital backed startup market. For more on  Israel’s tech sector, see Avnimelech and Teubal  2006 .  5   Both  accelerators  and  incubators  attempt  to  create  or  grow  small  startups.  Accelerators  are  highly-selective programs with a fixed time-frame  which require startups to apply; during the accel- erator, the startup works with various mentors to  improve their product and business, and is given  a small amount of seed money in exchange for  equity.  Incubators,  on  the  other  hand,  are  co- working spaces in which people similarly focused  on  particular  ideas  or  verticals  are  brought  together  in  an  attempt  to  nurture  innovation.  They rarely provide companies with money, and  often work with startups much earlier in the pro- cess  in  an  attempt  to  find  a  workable  business  model or product  Forrest, 2016 .  references  A Better San Francisco. 2015. ‘Community Tran-  sition Centers.’ www.transitioncenters.org   Anderson, M.

G e h l  It’s  common  to  start  any  essay  on  social  media  with  numbers,  especially  total  num- bers  of  users,  as  a  means  to  establish  their  significance.  So  I  will  do  the  same  here.  These are the estimated registered members  of several social networks:   	 Ello: over 2,000,000  	 *diaspora: 602,795  	 Twister: 80,493  	 GNU social: 25,8231  For  anyone  with  a  passing  familiarity  with  the  size  of  the  user  bases  of  Facebook,  Twitter, Google+, or Pinterest, these numbers  are not particularly impressive. However, for  students  of  social  media,  these  estimated  numbers tell us that there is life outside the  walls  of  the  dominant  social  media  plat- forms.  Ello,  *diaspora,  Twister,  and  GNU  social are part of a larger collection of sites  meant  to  be  alternatives  to  the  mainstream.  They  are,  as  I  call  them,  alternative  social  media.  What  makes  them  ‘alternative’?  In  this  chapter,  I  suggest  that  these  sites  are  not  alternative  in  the  sense  of  mere  choice   as  in,  you  have  a  choice  between  Coca-Cola  and Pepsi . Rather, they are alternative in the  same  sense  that  ‘alternative  media’   Atton,  2002   are  alternative:  their  internal  opera- tions,  economics,  and  cultural  practices  are  markedly  different  from  what  I  call  ‘corpo- rate  social  media.’  In  addition  to  providing  users with a choice, they provide new ways  of thinking about what ‘social media’ means.  Alternative social media exist as a response  to  the  criticisms  of  corporate  social  media:  namely,  their  surveillance  practices,  their  appropriation  of  user  data,  their  emphasis  on  marketing  messages  over  other  forms  of  connection, and their algorithmic shaping of  sociality, to name a few.  To highlight the differences between alter- native social media  hereafter, ASM  and cor- porate social media  hereafter, CSM , in the  first half of this chapter I will explore several  academic critiques of corporate social media,    alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  331  tracing lines of argument through technical,  economic,  and  cultural  lenses.  The  lines  of  critique described below are not exhaustive,  but they help illuminate differences between  corporate social media and alternative social  media.  In  the  final  half,  I  will  explore  how  various alternative social media can be seen  as responses to the criticisms leveled at CSM.  Much of the second half is derived from my  previous  work  on  ASM,  interviews  with  ASM makers and users, as well as my ongo- ing participant observation of multiple ASM  systems.  criTiques of corporaTe   social media  There  are  three  lines  of  critique  directed  at  corporate social media that have direct rele- vance for any exploration of alternative social  media. These are:  1  critiques of CSM tech- nical  infrastructures,  focusing  on  the  net- work  and  software  structures  of  CSM;   2   critiques  of  the  political  economy  of  CSM,  focusing on how CSM monetize user activi- ties  and  privilege  marketing  messages  over  other  forms  of  communication;  and   3   cri- tiques of the dominant cultural practices and  uses  of  CSM,  focusing  on  social  practices  that are partly conditioned by CSM. As with  anything  to  do  with  digital  media,  the  lines  between  technical,  economic,  and  cultural  activities are blurred.  Technical Infrastructures  The goal of this line of critique is to map how  CSM  are  ‘primarily  concerned  with  estab- lishing  the  technocultural  conditions  within  which users can produce content and within  which content and users can be re-channeled  through  techno-commercial  networks  and  channels’  Langlois et al., 2009 . Thus, criti- cal  exploration  of  the  technical  infrastruc- tures  of  CSM  comports  with  traditional   media theory, which focuses on the medium  over  the  message.  Critics  of  CSM  have  largely focused on two main topics: the  en  closed structure of CSM network topologies,  and their use of algorithms.  network   Much  of  the  criticisms  of  the  techni- cal  structures  of  CSM  are  directed  at  their  centralized  topologies.  Mark  Andrejevic’s   2007   criticism  of  Google’s  free wi-fi program as an example of ‘enclo- sure’  anticipates  this  line  of  critique.  For  Andrejevic,  technology  companies  such  as  Google  and  Microsoft  seek  to  enclose  end  users within a centralized network topology,  drawing  more  and  more  user  activity  into  corporate  surveillance  systems  and  policing  the ‘proper’ uses of their respective technolo- gies.  Moreover,  Andrejevic  also  notes  that  technology  firms  work  to  elide  the  internal  details  of  their  networks  behind  the   then  proverbial, now ubiquitous  discourse of the  ‘cloud’  also see Mosco, 2014 . ‘The cloud’  is in this case a fog that covers up the recen- tralized relationship between once relatively  autonomous  computer  users  and  the  manu- facturers  and  service  providers  those  com- puters now connect to. This relies on closed,  proprietary code and protocols that end users  cannot modify  Cabello et al., 2013: 340 .  This  critique  of  technology  firms’  dou- ble  move  of  centralization  and  wiring  shut   Gillespie,  2007   figures  into  later  criti- cal  work  exploring  CSM.  As  Gerlitz  and  Helmond   2013   have  shown,  Facebook’s  centralized  power  is  extending  through  the  ubiquitous  ‘Like’  button  and  Facebook’s  Connect  login  system. The  Like  button  and  Connect  appear  to  be  distributed  across  the  Web  in  a  decentralized  manner;  many  sites  allow for users to sign in with Facebook and  Like items on their pages. This decentralizes  the  point  of  data  gathering:  one  no  longer  needs  to  visit  Facebook.com  to  have  one’s  data  tracked  by  Facebook. Yet,  Gerlitz  and  Helmond argue that this distribution is always  connected to the centralized data processing  core of Facebook. This simultaneous, distrib- uted  centralization   Gehl,  2012 ,  where  end    332  users’  data  is  gathered  across  the  Internet  and  drawn  into  centralized  CSM,  exempli- fies the  en closed line of critique: critics are  finding that interaction is made more visible  and transparent as users channel their social  activities through social media. At the same  time,  the  inner  workings  of  social  media  –  data analysis, storage, and sales – are increas- ingly closed and opaque. Everything flows to  the  logical  center  –  large  server  farms  and  corporate headquarters – but the inner work- ings of that increasingly important and pow- erful center are obscured.  More recently, critical attention has turned  to the use of algorithms to shape social and  technical interactions within CSM platforms.  The  power  of  algorithms  to  shape  online  social  interaction  was  quite  visible  during  the  2014  controversy  over  the  Facebook  contagion  study,  where  social  scientists  from  Facebook,  UC-San  Francisco,  and  Cornell  manipulated  hundreds  of  thousands  of Facebook users’ social streams in order to  elicit  various  emotional  responses   Kramer  et  al.,  2014 .  However,  that  controversy  is  only a more visible example of longstanding  concerns over algorithmic shaping of culture.  For  example,  Twitter’s  ‘Trending  Topics’  algorithm has been criticized multiple times  for  perceived  censorship  of  topics  such  as  ‘Occupy Wall Street’  Gillespie, 2011 .  These  controversies  reveal  anxieties  over  CSM’s ability to algorithmically shape both  the present and the future. Writing about the  present,  Weltevrede,  Helmond,  and  Gerlitz   2014   have  explored  the  technical  con- struction  of  ‘real  time’  within  Facebook,  Twitter, and Google, among other platforms.  ‘Real-time,’  Internet  critic  Geert  Lovink  quips,  ‘is  the  new  crack’   Lovink,  2012:  11 . Weltevrede, Helmond, and Gerlitz show  us  how  this  ‘crack’  is  algorithmically  con- structed,  as  well  as  how  its  addictive  prop- erties are tied to CSM imperatives. Denying  any  essential,  a  priori  concept  of  time,  they  argue  that  Twitter,  Facebook,  and  Google  algorithmically engineer a sense of presence  and  immediacy  within  their  specific  sites:   ‘The  organization  of  the  pace  of  updates  can be thought of as a pattern through which  the  continuous  production  of  new  content  is  being  organized  in  ways  that  are  aligned  with the specific politics’  Weltevrede et al.,  2014: 19  of systems such as corporate social  media.  CSM  pushes  out  content,  notifying  us that there are five more Tweets, 10 more  Likes,  or  17  new  Google+  messages.  We  turn to them to know what’s going on now.  However, Weltevrede, Helmond, and Gerlitz  also note other temporalities that exist along- side these constant updates:  In  the  case  of  Twitter,  which  simultaneously  dis- plays  fresh,  new  content  and  relevant,  featured  results,  relevance  becomes  a  recommendation  feature  that  alters  the  pace  of  the  freshness  stream, as these so-called Top Tweets are designed  to  produce  future  user  engagement  by  making  them  sticky  and  able  to  stay  on  top  of  a  fast- changing stream.  Weltevrede et al., 2014: 18   These  multiple  temporalities  –  the  constant  appearance  of  fresh,  user-generated  content  on  the  one  hand,  and  curated  trends  on  the  other – are not accidental, but are tied to the  desires of CSM to keep our attention both on  streams  of  new  content  and  the  often  spon- sored  that  appear  alongside.  ‘sticky’  messages   These  ‘sticky’  messages  –  trending  top- ics,  recommended  reads,  and  the  like  –  are  the objects of multiple critics of CSM algo- rithms  who  focus  on  how  CSM  can  shape  the  future.  Ganaele  Langlois   2014   has  explored  the  ‘recommendation  engines’  of  corporate social media, seeing them as ‘colo- nization  of  users’  experiences  of  meaning’   Langlois, 2014: 85 . Langlois finds that rec- ommendation engines algorithmically shape  what  phenomenologists  call  ‘protention’   i.e.,  our  future  expectations;  see  Langlois,  2014; Hansen, 2006: 304; and Turow, 2011 .  Similarly, Ted Striphas critiques ‘algorithmic  culture,’  ‘the  enfolding  of  human  thought,  conduct, organization and expression into the  logic of big data and large-scale computation,  a  move  that  alters  how  the  category  culture    alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  333  has  long  been  practiced,  experienced  and  understood’   Striphas,  2015:  396 .  Striphas  sees CSM  and other large, centralized online  systems such as Netflix and Amazon  as the  new  arbiters  of  culture,  shaping  our  tastes  through  computer  code.  In  other  words,  as  more of our activities are channeled through  CSM,  CSM  has  more  influence  over  our  thoughts  and  actions  as  we  move  through  space and time.  In sum, the criticism of the technical ele- ments of CSM ties in their network topolo- gies, use of closed-access code and databases,  and their algorithmic shaping of both the pre- sent and future. The next line of critique, that  of political economy, draws our attention to  how  these  technical  infrastructures  relate  to  the profit motives of CSM.  Political Economy  When  it  comes  to  critiques  of  the  political  economy of corporate social media, perhaps  the most fundamental concept is that of free  labor.  This  concept,  proposed  by  Tiziana  Terranova   2000 ,  describes  how Web  users  contribute  valuable  labor  to  online  applica- tions. ‘Simultaneously voluntarily given and  unwaged,  enjoyed  and  exploited,  free  labor  on  the  Net  includes  the  activity  of  building  Web  sites,  modifying  software  packages,  reading and participating in mailing lists, and  building virtual spaces on MUDs and MOOs’   Terranova, 2000: 33 . Terranova’s argument  holds that digital capitalism requires a large  range of activities to keep it operating: mod- erating  online  communities,  adding  to  open  source  code,  or  tagging  objects,  to  name  a  few.  These  are  done,  for  the  most  part,  by  unpaid  volunteers,  to  the  benefits  of  for- profit  corporations  who  claim  ownership  over the results of users’ labors.  This  analytical  concept  had   immedi- ate  applicability  to  specific  instances  of  online  social  interactions.  Hector  Postigo   2003,  2009 ,  for  example,  explores  the  America  Online  volunteers  who  did  unpaid   work  to  maintain  AOL  forums.  Mark  Coté  and  Jennifer  Pybus   2007   take  up  the  con- cept  to  explore  how  MySpace  managed  its  users,  training  them  to  profile  themselves  and  contribute  to  the  cultural,  creative,  and  economic dimensions of the site. The prom- ise of MySpace was that users who worked  hard  enough  within  its  structures  would  become  hypervalorized  ‘MySpace  celebri- ties’; Coté and Pybus point to the example of  Tila Tequila, a celebrity who used MySpace  to promote herself and thus became a model  laborer for other MySpace users to emulate.  I myself take up the concept of free labor to  contrast Facebook’s management of its users  as free laborers with MySpace, arguing that  Facebook’s  more  standardized  structure  helped make its free laborer users more pro- ductive  Gehl, 2014b .  All of this begs questions: more productive  for whom? Who benefits economically from  the  free  labor  of  social  media  users?  CSM  relies on a basic exchange: you provide your  personal information and your free labor, and  in  exchange  CSM  gives  you  access.  While  you have access, part of your attention must  go  to  marketing  messages.  Therefore,  mar- keters  and  advertisers  are  the  primary  ben- eficiaries  of  user  free  labor.  Many  critics  suggest that users’ constructions of their own  profiles greatly benefit marketers and adver- tisers who previously had to do the work of  profiling people  see Elmer, 2004 . As Nick  Couldry  and  Joseph  Turow  note,  thanks  to  users doing the work of self-profiling them- selves in Facebook and Twitter, ‘It is … now  possible to buy the right to deliver an ad with  a message tailored to a person with a specific  profile at the precise moment that that person  loads a Web page’  Couldry and Turow, 2014:  1714 . As  Maria  Bakardjieva  puts  it,  ‘Thus  we find our Facebook profile page populated  with  our  friends’  images,  pronouncements,  witty  snippets  and  exclamations,  all  imp- ishly mixed up with rider boots, cruise ships,  designer  clothes,  eye-glass  frames  –  you  name  it.  In  fact  we  have  named  it,  directly  or not – at some point in the recent past, and    334  Facebook  is  happy  to  oblige’   Bakardjieva,  2014:  376 .  Here  we  see  a  corollary  to  the  ‘realtimeness’  that  Weltevrede,  Helmond,  and  Gerlitz   2014   found  in  their  analysis  of CSM technical structures: as users do the  work of responding to real-time prompts  and  therefore contribute to social streams , CSM  sites mine their activities and sell their atten- tion in real-time to marketers and advertisers  who place targeted ads into end-users’ social  media screens.  But  marketers  and  advertisers  aren’t  the  only  ones  benefiting  from  the  free  labor  of  users. The CSM platforms do, as well. Taina  Bucher’s   2012   analysis  of  Facebook’s  EdgeRank algorithm suggests that Facebook  privileges  constant  user  participation  in  the  site,  which  in  turn  prompts  other  users  to  continue to provide content as they all work  against becoming ‘invisible’ or drowned out  by the constant stream of updates. Gerlitz and  Helmond  2013  trace the ‘Like economy’ to  find  the  ways  in  which  such  simple  binary  signals  constitute  a  whole  range  of  online  practices.  Participation  in  Facebook   liking,  friending,  commenting ,  Twitter   tweeting,  retweeting,  favoriting ,  or  Google+   +1ing,  sorting contacts into circles  has a multipli- cative effect: the resulting ‘data and numbers  have  performative  and  productive  capaci- ties,  they  can  generate  user  affects,  enact  more activities and thus multiply themselves’   Gerlitz  and  Helmond,  2013:  13 .  Bringing  these  works  together,  we  see  that  CSM  are  structured to intensify user participation, with  the benefit of more traffic on these respective  sites,  more  user  attention  paid  to  them,  and  more data produced by users  which can then  be sold to marketers .  CSM users who operate within these log- ics  often  internalize  them  and  reflect  them  in  their  practices.  Indeed,  Alice  Marwick  and danah boyd’s  2010  analysis of Twitter  users  find  that  many  of  them  negotiate  cat- egories  such  as  ‘authenticity’  and  ‘profes- sionalism’ in order to present themselves to  their  imagined  audiences.  ‘These  exemplify  highly  self-conscious  identity  presentations   that  assume  a  primarily  professional  con- text. Revealing personal information is seen  as  a  marker  of  authenticity,  but  is  strategi- cally  managed  and  limited’   Marwick  and  boyd,  2010:  127 .  Building  on  these  obser- vations,  both  Marwick   2013   and  I   Gehl,  2011   argue  that  the  logic  of  branding  and  marketing has been folded back onto corpo- rate social media users themselves, who are  encouraged  to  think  of  themselves  as  ‘per- sonal brands.’ Thus, CSM users not only do  the work of building out the content of sites  such as Facebook and Twitter, or the work of  self-profiling so marketers no longer have to,  they  also  construct  themselves  in  idealized  ways,  mimicking  the  economic  practices  of  corporate  branding  and  attempting  to  con- trol how their profiles influence other users’  sentiments.  So far, I have traced the political economy  line  of  critique  with  little  regard  for  polis.  However,  several  critics  have  addressed  this  topic,  specifically  the  concern  that  the  dominant CSM institutions  e.g., Facebook,  Twitter,  Pinterest,  and  Google   are  pecu- liarly  American,  specifically  Californian,  companies.  As  Geert  Lovink  and  Miriam  Rasch   2013   note,  ‘Social  media  culture  is  belied  in American  corporate  capitalism,  dominated by the logic of startups and ven- ture capital, management buyouts, IPOs, etc.  Three  to  four  companies  literally  own  the  Western  social  media  landscape  and  capi- talize  on  the  content  produced  by  millions  of  people  around  the  world’   Lovink  and  Rasch, 2013: 367 .  In an example of the critique of American  dominance  of  CSM,  Jack  Bratich   2011   traces  states  of  exception  as  the  US  State  Department  adjudicates  between  foreign  media  and  home-grown  media.  In  the  case  of Egypt, for example, ‘we see an interesting  divide  here.  In  residual  cold-war  logic,  the  sovereign adversaries are said to have State- run  mass  media. The  USA,  meanwhile,  has  State-friended social media’  Bratich, 2011:  629 . In other words, US political elites sup- port Silicon Valley-native companies as they    alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  335  expand around the world, hailing their growth  as media democratization, while condemning  other  nations’  media  systems  as  necessarily  totalitarian and oppressive.  Thus,  the  technical  structures  explored  by  CSM  critics  link  up  with  these  political  economic  concerns:  CSM  are  centralized,  American, for-profit firms that deploy algo- rithms  to  intensify  content  production  by  users, appropriating and selling the resulting  data to marketers and advertisers, supported  by  hegemonic  governments. This  has  direct  implications for how subjectivities are shaped  in and through CSM. I take up the overdeter- mination between CSM technical structures,  political  economy,  and  cultural  practices  in  the next section.  Cultural Practices  When we consider how culture – that is, day- to-day practices and subjectivities – is over- determined  with  technical  and  economic  spheres,  we  see  many  articulations  between  network  structures,  algorithms,  political  economy, and the cultures of communication  and  sociality  that  are  mediated  in  CSM.  Cultural  practices  that  have  shaped,  been  shaped by, and emerged within the technical  and economic imperatives of CSM have not  gone unnoticed by critics.  The relationship between subjectivity, per- formance, and surveillance practices has per- haps been the single most explored topic for  critical  CSM  scholars.  Scholars  have  docu- mented the various ways that CSM users per- form, exhibit, and curate the self for others,  whether those others be identifiable contacts  or  an  imagined  audience   Albrechtslund,  2008;  Donath  and  boyd,  2004;  Hogan,  2010;  Marwick  and  boyd,  2010 .  In  mak- ing performative declarations about hobbies,  passions,  friends,  and  desires,  CSM  users  construct  themselves  in  ways  that  previous  media systems did not allow. However, users’  knowledge that such performances are medi- ated, structured, and recorded has a particular   impact  upon  how  they  live  their  day-to-day  lives.  Dubrofsky   2011 ,  for  example,  finds  that Facebook normalizes surveillance as part  of daily life:  Facebook animates a seamless  unremarkable  inte- gration  of  surveillance  into  the  lives  of  users.  …  Facebook effectively situates users as the master of  their own surveillance and as the producers of their  self under surveillance. On Facebook, surveillance is  a practice of the self.  Dubrofsky, 2011: 120   This  normalization  of  surveillance  is  espe- cially  troubling  when  we  consider  the  links  between  recorded  and  mediated  perfor- mances of identity and the growing surveil- lance state. As Kirsty Best  2010  has shown,  ‘I have nothing to hide’ is a prevalent attitude  among  everyday  Internet  users,  even  as  a  steady drumbeat about corporate and govern- ment  surveillance  sounds  in  the  news   also  see  Solove,  2007 .  The  normalized  surveil- lance  practices  of  CSM  invite  users  to  pro- duce  their  data  declarations,  and,  as  Best  notes,  end  users  believe that they must be truthful and trans- parent in order to benefit from them.  themselves   through   Dubrofsky suggests that the self as consti- tuted by surveillance produces a data-driven,  profiled subject:  The  Facebook  subject  exists  mostly  through  the  data  tracks  it  makes   there  are  few  activities  a  subject  can  engage  in  that  do  not  create  data  tracks traceable by either the makers of the site or  by other users , which verify its existence as well as  create its subjectivity: Facebook subjects are aggre- gates of traceable data.  Dubrofsky, 2011: 124   Indeed,  as  attention  to  and  funding  for  Big  Data analysis increases, conceptions of who  we  are  and  what  possibilities  lie  before  us  can be increasingly decided in relation to the  data  profiles  we  are  building  within  CSM   Mackenzie,  2013 .  Given  that  centralized  CSM systems have particular economic goals  in mind  i.e., the abstraction and sale of our  information and the direction of our attention  to  marketing  messages ,  the  sort  of  subjec- tivities  that  are  being  shaped  within  and  through  CSM  are  increasingly  tied  to  those    336  economic  imperatives.  Ultimately,  I  would  suggest  that  the  subjectivity  preferred  in  CSM and produced through normalized sur- veillance is not that of the citizen, but of the  consumer  Gehl, 2013 .  Alongside  the  concerns  about  surveil- lance  practices  and  the  construction  of  the  self,  recent  criticism  of  CSM,  especially  Facebook   but  to  a  lesser  extent  Google+  and  LinkedIn ,  has  been  directed  at  their  requirement that users sign up with their real  names.  While  early  CSM  saw  the  practice  of  ‘Fakesters’   i.e.,  fake  or  pseudonymous  profiles   boyd, 2006 , Facebook was able to  create a culture of real-world identities, both  through  relying  on  third-party  verification   college  IDs  at  first,  then  later  work-based  emails   and  through  the  use  of  the  ‘social  graph’  as  a  means  to  vet  individuals   Gehl,  2014b: 85 . Twitter of course does not have  a real-name policy, but its increasing promi- nence as a place where media outlets, celeb- rities, and businesses promote themselves as  ‘brands,’ as well as the badge of honor that is  the ‘verified account’ status, are tied to a cul- ture of authenticity within the site  Marwick  and  boyd,  2010 .  Google+  had  a  real-name  policy,  but  dropped  it  under  pressure  from  protesters   MacKinnon  and  Lim,  2014 . As  José van Dijck  2013: 200  argues, ‘Platform  owners have a vested interest in pushing the  need  for  a  uniform  online  identity  to  attain  maximum  transparency,  not  only  because  they  want  to  know  who  their  users  are,  but  also  because  advertisers  want  users’  “truth- ful” data.’ A user signed up with a real-world  identity  is  thus  more  valuable  to  market- ers, and we might expect more demands for  real  names  in  CSM  in  the  future,  protests  notwithstanding.  Indeed,  this  cultural  practice  has  ossified  into a policy: the ‘real-world identity’ policy  of Facebook. Facebook’s policy manifests in  multiple ways, including the requirement of a  government ID to sign up  if a user is unable  or unwilling to provide a mobile phone num- ber   as  well  as  the  recent  controversy  over  the use of stage names by drag queens within   Facebook  Lux, 2014 . Examining the latter,  Jessa Lingel and Adam Golub  2015  explore  how  drag  performers  use  social  media.  As  they argue,  Drag  performers  are  tasked  not  only  with  fitting  complex  narratives  of  gender  into  rigid  online  interfaces,  but  with  leveraging  social  media  tools  in  service  of  personal,  professional,  and  commu- nity  objectives.  While  drag  itself  presents  a  dra- matic form of complexity, there are more general  layers  of  complexity  around  negotiating  personal  and professional life within a single platform. We  argue  that  Facebook,  like  other  dominant  social  media platforms, tends towards a design ethic of  singularity  and  simplicity,  fundamentally  at  odds  with technological preferences  or needs  for com- plexity and mess.  Lingel and Golub, 2015: 537   This ‘design ethic of singularity and simplic- ity’ runs counter to the identity-play that we  presumably have in online interactions  e.g.,  Turkle, 1995 . Instead, CSM’s ‘conflation of  self-expression,  self-communication  and  self-promotion into one tool, which is subse- quently used for personality assessment and  manipulating  behavior,  should  raise  the  awareness of users in their different roles as  citizens,  friends,  employees,  employers  and  so on’  van Dijck, 2013: 213 .  Similarly,  the  ‘singularity  and  simplicity’  of the term ‘friend,’ as it is used in CSM, has  been  critically  explored.  danah  boyd   boyd,  2006; Donath and boyd, 2004 , for example,  has done pioneering work on the early CSM  sites Friendster and MySpace, contrasting the  vernacular  meaning  of  friendship  with  the  actual practices of users. Users of Friendster,  for example, listed as ‘Friends’ ‘fellow par- tygoers, people they knew  and people they  thought  they  knew ,  old  college  mates  that  they  hadn’t  talked  to  in  years,  people  with  entertaining  Profiles,  and  anyone  that  they  found  interesting.  Not  everyone  took  the  Friendship  process  seriously’   boyd,  2006 .  Despite this observation, rather than bemoan- ing the erosion of friendship and social inter- action, boyd’s valuable work has empirically  examined new forms of sociality enabled by  CSM, especially for teens and young adults.   alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  337  However, even as critics have noted com- plex,  emergent  new  forms  of  sociality  in  CSM,  they  also  have  evaluated  the  quality  of  those  new  social  interactions.  Some  crit- ics  find  them  lacking.  Bernard  Stiegler,  for  example,  draws  on  Aristotelian  philosophy  and decries the ‘social engineering’ of CSM:  By   formally   declaring  our  ‘friends’  and  our  ‘friendship,’ and also operating a selection among  our  friends,  acquaintances,  and  contacts  of  all  sorts, here all lumped together under the appella- tion ‘friends,’ we trigger a profound alteration of  what  used  to  be  understood  as  social  networks:  friends, family and relatives, acquaintances, chums,  pals,  old  social  structures,  the  very  ones  creating  those  networks  and  depending  on  them  at  the  same time.  Stiegler, 2013: 20, original emphasis   Stiegler  goes  on  to  suggest  that  the  formal  declaration  of  connection  in  sites  like  Facebook  is  the  ‘grammatization’   i.e.,  dis- cretization,  abstraction,  and  rationalization   of  social  relations,  which  can  enable  the  modulation  and  control  of  populations  and  ultimately  the  ‘destruction  of  the  social’   Stiegler, 2013: 27 .  Similarly, although she does not use Stiegler’s  term  ‘grammatization,’  Maria  Bakardjieva  points to the discretization process:  Twitter gives us the benefits of purging all words  that do not represent the most direct means to an  end.  Facebook  conveniently  serves  us  with  a  button  to  register  our  ‘likes’,  thus  saving  us  the  need to expend time and imagination on crafting  an approving comment.  Bakardjieva, 2014: 374   Ultimately,  Bakardjieva  concurs  with  Stiegler, criticizing the ‘McDonaldization’ of  friendship:  ‘interpersonal  sharing  is  mass- produced,  standardized  and  automated.  By  claiming ownership over the notion of friend- ship, social media platforms seize the power  to  mold  its  cultural  understanding  in  a  for- mally  rationalized  manner’   Bakardjieva,  2014: 381 .  There  is  certainly  much  more  to  be  said  about  CSM,  both  from  critical  perspectives  and from more celebratory frameworks. The  lines  of  technical,  economic,  and  cultural   critique I offer here are germane to the next  section: the exploration of alternative social  media  systems  that  have  been  built  as  a  response  to  the  growing  body  of  criticism  leveled at CSM.  from criTicism To code  At  its  best,  criticism  –  the  active  interroga- tion  of  cultural  practices  –  opens  up  new  possibilities  of  imagination  and  practice   Feenberg, 1986 . But this opening up is also  a  key  limitation  of  critique;  very  often  the  critic  is  satisfied  with  pointing  out  flaws,  ruptures,  and  contradictions  while  leaving  the construction of solutions to others.  To be fair to academic critics of CSM, most  do not have the training or time to construct  solutions  to  the  problems  in  sites  such  as  Facebook and Twitter. Nor are they likely to  receive any institutional benefits from doing  so.  However,  as  I  argue  elsewhere   Gehl,  2014b ,  tackling  sociotechnical  problems  requires more than critique; all of us need to  learn from the knowledge gained by critical  inquiry  and  apply  it  to  specific,  grounded,  viable sociotechnical solutions, as well. This  is a process I call ‘critical reverse engineer- ing.’ Fortunately, there are a growing number  of coders, software engineers, Web adminis- trators, and users who are developing alterna- tives to CSM: what I call ‘alternative social  media’  Gehl, 2015c . ASM are technologies  built as a critical response to CSM; they are  new social media systems that replicate posi- tive  features  of  CSM  while  removing  nega- tive features.  The origin story of one such ASM site, dias- pora*,  illustrates  this  move  from  critique  to  code quite well. In February of 2010, lawyer,  Internet  scholar,  and  activist  Eben  Moglen  spoke at a meeting of the Internet Society of  New York at New York University  Moglen,  2010a, 2010b . In that talk, Moglen summed  up  many  of  the  critiques  of  CSM  detailed  here:  their  centralization  on  server  farms,    338  their  for-profit  nature,  and  their  ‘[degenera- tion  of]  the  integrity  of  human  personality’   Moglen, 2010a, 2010b . But after those cri- tiques, Moglen made an impassioned plea:  The  problems  are  really  bad.  …  The  solution  is  made of our parts. We’ve got to do it. That’s my  message. It’s Friday night. Some people don’t want  to go right back to coding I’m sure. We could put  it  off  until  Tuesday  but  how  long  do  you  really  want  to  wait?  You  know  every  day  that  goes  by  there’s more data we’ll never get back. Every day  that goes by there’s more data inferences we can’t  undo. Every day that goes by we pile up more stuff  in the hands of the people who got too much. So  it’s not like we should say ‘one of these days I’ll get  around to that.’ It’s not like we should say ‘I think  I’d  rather  sort  of  spend  my  time  browsing  news  about [the] iPad.’  Moglen, 2010a, 2010b   In the audience were four New York University  students, Ilya Zhitomirskiy, Dan Grippi, Max  Salzberg,  and  Raphael  Sofaer,  who  took  up  Moglen’s call and began diaspora*, one of the  ASM projects I will detail below.  I point to this origin story as an example of  the interface between critique and construc- tion.  This  is  an  academic  critic  making  the  case  for  solutions  to  the  problems  of  CSM  and coders seeking a project they could pur- sue. Such meetings of critics and coders need  to happen more often.  Here, I will trace a range of projects that  have  taken  seriously  the  critiques  leveled  at  CSM  and  have  produced  possible  solu- tions in the form of alternative social media.  Mirroring the above sections, I will examine  ASM  in  terms  of  technical  infrastructures,  political economy, and cultural practices.  Technical Infrastructures  A great deal of innovative work has gone into  addressing  the  criticism  of  CSM  centraliza- tion. Because CSM are centralized – that is,  they  comport  to  a  star  network  topology,  where all data flows to a logical center – then  ASM must decentralize.  Many ASM take one of two approaches to  implement  decentralization:  federation  and   distribution. The first approach, federation, is  taken by systems such as diaspora*, rstat.us,  and  GNU  social.2  The  federation  approach  modifies the server-client architecture so that  multiple, independent Web servers can ‘fed- erate’ into a larger network. In their paper on  diaspora*, Bielenberg et al.  2012  explain:  Rather than forcing users to store all their informa- tion on one central server or a collection of servers  owned by one single entity, the Diaspora network  users decide for themselves on which servers their  information will be stored. Some users choose to  maintain  their  own  Diaspora  servers  in  order  to  keep complete control of their data, while others  might choose to join an existing server.  Bielenberg  et al., 2012: 13   Thus, a user might run diaspora*, rstat.us, or  GNU social on her own server, or she might  sign  up  on  a  server  run  by  someone  she  trusts.  Either  way,  users  can  communicate  with one another across servers using proto- cols  that  are  included  with  the  software.  diaspora*  explains  this  process  with  the  metaphor of seeds: diaspora*’s logo is a dan- delion  gone  to  seed.  Metaphorically,  a  new  server is a ‘seed’ planted by the overall pro- ject, blooming as new members join.  Distribution,  on  the  other  hand,  is  even  more  decentralized.  Whereas  federation  employs the client-server architecture, distri- bution relies on peer-to-peer connections. In  this architecture, there are no central servers;  every device attached to the network  phone,  tablet,  laptop,  or  desktop  computer   is  both  a server and a client. Given the prominence  of  peer-to-peer  systems  such  as  Napster  in  the early-to-mid-2000s, many computer sci- entists  explored  ways  to  build  peer-to-peer  social  networks   e.g.,  Ackermann  et  al.,  2008; Koll et al., 2014; Mahdian et al., 2011 .  However, there have been series of very dif- ficult technical problems to solve, including  authenticating users and the storage of data.  Two  viable  solutions  to  these  problems  are  bittorrent  protocols  and  blockchain  storage  systems   such  as  the  one  used  by  Bitcoin .  The project that has synthesized these tech- nologies into a peer-to-peer ASM microblog    alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  339  is  Twister   Freitas,  2015 .  Twister  allows  now-conventional  microblogging  practices   following, short messaging, repeating mes- sages, and replying , but it does so as a fully  independent node operating on the end users’  devices.  I should note that not all ASMs use decen- tralized  architectures,  whether  federated  or  distributed.  Many  operate  as  centralized  client-server  systems.  Ello,  for  example,  uses  the  standard  centralized  model.  The  dark  web  social  network  Galaxy2  operates  as a Tor hidden service, which means that it  runs  on  a  centralized  server,  albeit  one  that  has its geographic location hidden. As a 2012  critical survey of the economics and techni- cal  structures  of  decentralized  architectures  found, decentralization is a very difficult task   Narayanan et al., 2012 . But even in the few  years since that survey was released, decen- tralized  networks  are  becoming  the  norm  among ASMs.  A corollary to decentralization is the open- ing up of internal details. Whereas Facebook,  Google, Twitter, and Pinterest store data and  run code on server farms that are inaccessi- ble  to  end  users,  making  them,  as  Gillespie   2007  might put it, ‘wired shut,’ many ASM  use  Free,  Open  Source  Software   hereaf- ter  FLOSS ,  or  even  Public  Domain  licens- ing  schemes,  enabling  end  users  the  ability  to  inspect,  modify,  and  replicate  their  code.  As a project sponsored by the Free Software  Foundation, GNU social, for example, is free  software. As  GNU  social  founder  Matt  Lee  explains:  Free software is software that can be controlled by  the users of the software, rather than the develop- ers.  Users  of  a  free  program  can  run,  copy  and  modify  the  program  to  suit  their  own  uses,  and  share  copies  with  friends  and  colleagues.  GNU  social is a little different in that it is primarily used  in a web browser, so we used a special free soft- ware license that extends these freedoms to users  in a browser.  Quoted in Gehl, 2015c: 6   Whereas  Facebook,  Google,  Twitter,  and  Pinterest’s  software  is  obscured  in  a  cloud,  the  lines  of  code  comprising  Free  Software   are open for inspection by all, including end  users.  Finally, as for the algorithmic shaping of the  present and future, the predominant response  of ASM is simple: they don’t use algorithms  to  shape  social  streams.  For  example,  Ello  proclaims,  ‘Ello  doesn’t  use  manipulative  algorithms  that  control  what  you  see’   Ello  Dictionary, 2015 . This might change as these  systems grow, but in keeping with their status  as  alternatives,  it  is  possible  that  ASM  will  approach  the  use  of  algorithms  quite  differ- ently  from  CSM.  In  a  personal  interview,  Twister  creator  Miguel  Freitas  noted  that,  in  the future, users might demand algorithms to  shape what they see in Twister. However,  Because content is always delivered to your node  unfiltered, that means that any content filter will  have to be applied locally. Pretty much like those  SPAM  filters  which  for  a  while  were  built  into  POP3 IMAP  clients.  This  hypothetical  filter  would  be open for examination and configuration by the  user. … The user would always have the final word  on what is filtered and how the algorithm works.  Thus, in contrast to the algorithms developed  by  data  scientists  and  software  engineers  working  for  Facebook,  Google,  Pinterest,  and  Twitter,  ASM  algorithms  would  likely  arise  from  end  users   admittedly,  end  users  with  coding  abilities .  Moreover,  because  ASM tend to rely on FLOSS licensing, these  algorithms would be open to end-user inspec- tion and auditing.  The  lack  of  ASM  algorithms  begs  the  question:  why  do  CSM  use  them?  The  answer  offered  by  executives  at  Facebook  and Twitter is: we want users to see the most  relevant items. Otherwise, users would drown  in content. The fact that ASM can offer simi- lar features to CSM without shaping streams  with algorithms undermines the CSM execu- tives’ arguments. In my experience on a host  of ASM  sites,  I  have  not  encountered  users  complaining  about  the  pace  or  volume  of  content, nor have I seen any users asking for  algorithms to shape what they see. For now,  ASM  users  enjoy  ‘raw’  streams  of  updates  and content from their fellow users.   340  Political Economy  In mid-2014, the social networking site Ello  got  a  lot  of  attention,  especially  due  to  its  manifesto, which read in its entirety:  Your social network is owned by advertisers.  Every post you share, every friend you make, and  every  link  you  follow  is  tracked,  recorded,  and  converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so  they can show you more ads. You are the product  that’s bought and sold.  We  believe  there  is  a  better  way.  We  believe  in  audacity.  We  believe  in  beauty,  simplicity,  and  transparency.  We  believe  that  the  people  who  make things and the people who use them should  be in partnership.  We  believe  a  social  network  can  be  a  tool  for  empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce, and  manipulate – but a place to connect, create, and  celebrate life.  You are not a product.  Ello Manifesto, 2014   Ello’s manifesto was cited in a range of news  outlets which proclaimed it to be a novelty:  an  ‘ad-free  social  network’   e.g.,  Butcher,  2014 .  However,  a  marker  of  many  ASMs,  including those created prior to Ello, is their  refusal  to  engage  in  the  dominant  political  economy  of  the  Internet:  the  sale  of  user  attention to marketers. In other words, ASM  refuse advertising.  As  I  suggest  elsewhere   Gehl,  2015c ,  the  refusal  of  advertising  in ASM  does  two  things: first, it denies moneyed speech – that  is,  statements  that  become  more  prominent  because they are made by those who pay for  the  privilege.  Even  as  CSM  are  lauded  for  allowing  all  of  us  to  speak,  they  have  built  into their interfaces spaces for ‘louder’ voices –  advertisers – whose messages get privileged  positions on our screens. Second, and perhaps  more importantly, refusing Internet advertis- ing  denies  the  entire  socio-technical  sys- tem that it stands in for: cross-site tracking,  standardized  exchanges,  and  organizational  dynamics   such  as  having  departments  and  engineers dedicated to improving advertising   response  rates    Turow,  2011 .  The  anti- commercial ethos of ASM is in large part a  reaction to the ways in which advertising has  warped  previous  media  systems,  including  CSM, radio, and print.  In addition, the lack of advertising on ASM  alters ASM’s  relationship  to  free  labor.  Like  CSM,  ASM  rely  on  the  free  labor  of  their  users:  users  construct  profiles,  write  posts,  comment on each other’s posts, declare con- nections,  and  signal  affection   i.e.,  ‘liking’  or  ‘loving’,  depending  on  the  system . Their  affective work constitutes ASM, just as it does  CSM. However, the ends to which this work is  put are often different. For example, on a dark  web social network I explored  Gehl, 2014a ,  a user and an administrator collaborated on a  privacy  policy,  with  other  users  commenting  on drafts. Users who contributed did so out of  a sense of duty to what they called their ‘com- munity.’ Contrast this with the privacy policies  of sites such as Facebook, which are not writ- ten in consultation with users and appear to be  more about laying greater and greater claim to  user data  Opsahl, 2010 . Moreover, because  ASM  software  is  often  licensed  as  FLOSS,  users  can  contribute  their  free  labor  to  the  modification of the codebase.  Finally,  in  line  with  the  decentraliza- tion  of  network  topologies,  there’s  a  politi- cal  decentralization  happening  in  ASM,  as  well. While many ASM have been conceived  of and developed in the United States  e.g.,  diaspora*,  GNU  social,  rstat.us ,  they  have  been  contributed  to  and  greatly  modified  by  people  outside  the  USA.  GNU  social,  for  example,  has  been  extensively  modified  by  En  Kompis  Kompis,  a  Swedish  team  of  software  coders  who  have  built  Quitter.se,  an ASM meant to challenge the power of the  American  firm Twitter.  Likewise,  according  to https:  podupti.me , there are 93 diaspora*  servers running worldwide as of this writing,  and only 18%  17  of them are hosted in the  United  States.  Many  of  them  are  located  in  Germany, Holland, and France.  But  ASM  are  also  being  developed  out- side the United States. One key example was    alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  341  Lorea, a federated ASM platform, developed  to support the Occupy movement as it mani- fested  in  Spain  and  across  Europe.  Lorea,  notably, was built specifically as a social net- working  system  dedicated  for  such  protest  movements. This makes it unique; rather than  being a pre-existing system appropriated for  protest  as has happened with CSM such as  Twitter ,  Lorea  was  built  with  the  needs  of  protestors in mind  carolina, 2012 .  Development  of ASM  outside  the  United  States is important both as a challenge to the  technological  dominance  of  the  USA  and  because  of  the  recent  revelations  about  US  National  Security  Agency  spying  on  non- Americans. Brazil, for example, has for years  sought  to  protect  its  indigenous  technology  industries from the power of US firms such  as Microsoft  Paiva, 2009 . Moreover, it has  reacted  to  leaked  documents  that  reveal  US  surveillance  of  Brazilian  leaders  by  intensi- fying the development of its own technology  industry  Mari, 2013; Solon, 2013 . Brazilian  support  for  FLOSS  is  now  presented  as  a  national  response  to  the  centralized  techno- logical power of the United States.  This  is  more  than  simply  keeping  U.S.  corporations  at  bay  or  blocking  US  spying.  Many of the reforms made by the Brazilian  government  are  radical  changes  the  dominant regimes of copyright and intellec- tual  property.  According  to  Simon  Phipps,  Brazil’s new  to   License  for  Trademarks  …  adds  additional  rights  on  top  of  those  delivered  by  open  source.  It  ensures that any trademarks used in the software  can be freely used by the community and means  that  control  of  trademarks  can’t  be  used  to  chill  the  ability  to  exercise  the  four  freedoms  [of  Free  Software].  Phipps, 2011   This  license  is  required  of  all  government- sponsored  software  projects.  Although  Twister is not government-sponsored, it’s not  surprising  that  it  has  emerged  from  Brazil,  complete  with  an  Open  Source  software  license  and  a  distributed  architecture  meant  to  prevent American  companies  from  being   able  to  shut  down  communication  in  Brazil   or  anywhere  else,  for  that  matter    Gehl,  2015a:  8–9 .  Indeed,  Twister  appears  to  be  growing in use among Chinese activists, pos- sibly for these very reasons.  Cultural Practices  As I argue elsewhere  Gehl, 2015c , given the  revelations  about  both  corporate  and  govern- ment surveillance over the past few years, as  well  as  the  normalized  surveillance  practices  of  CSM  themselves,  we  might  conclude  that  ASM  must  be  anti-surveillance.  This,  we  might  conclude,  would  lead  to  different  day- to-day practices occurring in ASM, ones tied  less  to  public  performances  of  identity  and  more to other factors. However, this is not the  case. Social media – corporate or alternative –  is defined by its public, performative aspects.  Both CSM and ASM share the three features  proposed by Ellison and boyd  2013 :  A social network site is a networked communica- tion platform in which participants 1  have uniquely  identifiable  profiles  that  consist  of  user-supplied  content,  content  provided  by  other  users,  and or  system-level  data;  2   can  publicly  articulate  con- nections  that  can  be  viewed  and  traversed  by  others; and 3  can consume, produce, or interact  with  streams  of  user-generated  content  provided  by their connections on this site.  Ellison and boyd,  2013, original emphasis   What  distinguishes  ASM  from  CSM  is  a  more  democratic  form  of  surveillance:  ‘a  wider  negotiation  of  flows  of  vision  and  obfuscation than is allowed in CSM’  Gehl,  2015c:  7;  also  see  Fuchs,  2012 .  This  is  clearest  to  see  when  we  consider  federated  and  distributed ASM   e.g.,  diaspora*,  GNU  social,  Twister .  Because  these  systems  can  be installed by end users, either on servers or  local devices, the administrative control over  them  shifts  from  their  creators  to  the  end  users. For example, I run Twister on several  of my devices. This gives me, and me alone,  administrative  control;  not  even  Twister  founder  Miguel  Freitas  could  access  my    342  systems. Moreover, alongside this reduction  in administrative surveillance capacity, users  of ASM  actively  monitor  the  technical  and  policy decisions of administrators, critiquing  their  choices  and  demanding  reforms  if  necessary.  The stated goal of many ASM is to allow  censorship-free speech. Given that Facebook  and  Twitter  users  know  that  their  state- ments  are  monitored  both  by  other  users,  these respective CSMs, and state agents, and  given  that  Facebook  and  Twitter  have  cen- sored user posts many times  Gerstein, 2010;  Pagliery, 2015 , we might expect CSM users  to  carefully  monitor  what  they  say  in  order  to  avoid  crossing  a  legal  or  normative  line.  In  other  words,  we  can  expect  a  degree  of  self- censorship  within  CSM.  This  may  not  be a day-to-day concern of most CSM users   although  Marwick  and  boyd   2010   have  found evidence for this , but activists are quite  aware  of  the  pitfalls  of  CSM   Poell,  2014;  Terranova  and  Donovan,  2013 .  Activists  might be our proverbial ‘canaries in the coal  mine,’ indicators of how deeply the internali- zation  of  the  gaze  of  surveillance  has  pene- trated into everyday users. In turn, following  Foucault  1979 , we can expect the internali- zation of the gaze to impact how we consti- tute  ourselves  as  data  subjects  within  CSM.  In  contrast,  by  building  systems  specifically  to avoid censorship, ASM alter the parameters  within which users can construct themselves  through declarations and performances.  Where  these  altered  parameters  play  out  most prominently are in terms of real names  and  pseudonyms.  In  2014,  Facebook’s  real- name  policy  prompted  public  attention  to  Ello,  revealing  a  major  difference  between  ASM and CSM: there has never been a real- name  policy  in  any  ASM.  Instead,  ASM  hearken back to an Internet before the real- name culture, a time of pseudonyms and the  identity exploration that comes with them.  Finally, I turn to the critique of the quality  of social interaction on CSM, which centers  on  the  use  of  the  term  ‘friend.’  ASM  have  responded  to  criticisms  of  the  reduction  of   all  relationships  to  ‘friendship’  by  work- ing  on  new  methods  of  connection.  dias- pora*,  for  example,  pioneered  the  concept  of ‘aspects’, where users can sort their con- tacts into various categories, such as friends,  family,  colleagues   All  about  aspects,  n.d. .  The  activist-centric  ASM  Crabgrass  used  a  completely  different  connective  metaphor:  the group  Sparrow, 2012 . As ASM mature,  we may see more such experimentation with  both  the  granularity  of  social  connection  as  well  as  new  metaphors  and  approaches  to  connection.  However,  such  experimentation  can  only  go  so  far;  in  other  essays   Gehl,  2015b,  2015c , I suggest that ASM can experiment  with existing social media conventions only  up  to  the  point  when  they  begin  to  offer  something  distinctly  different  from  social  networking. Returning to Ellison and boyd’s   2013   definition  cited  above,  articulating  connections is a sine qua non of social net- working sites. Such practices are a source of  the pleasures of social networking and online  connection. Metaphors such as ‘friends’ and  ‘likes’  are  recognizable  markers  of  these  practices; thus ASM deploy them to signal to  end users their purposes and goals.  conclusion  As builders and activists Cabello et al. argue,  Contributing  to  the  design  and  development  of  technopolitical tools enhances ‘technological sov- ereignty.’ There are examples of such a rich contri- bution by citizens, for example the development of  communal  radio  and  television  broadcasting,  the  launch of the first non-military satellite into orbit,  the  invention  of  free  software  and  licenses,  and  even the first news portal on the Internet with an  open  and  anonymous  publication  system,  set  up  by the Indymedia network in 1999.  Cabello et al.,  2013: 340   Here,  Cabello  et  al.  articulate  alternative  social  media   such  as  their  project,  Lorea   into a larger history of alternative media and    alternative soCial Media: FroM Critique to Code  343  technologies. Following them, I suggest that  the  best  framework  for  understanding ASM  is in terms of ‘alternative media’: media that  challenge centralized media power  Couldry  and Curran, 2003: 7 . ASM do so by multiple  means:   	 Offering  decentralized  network  topologies  that  do not enclose users or their devices into central- ized star topologies;   	 Opening up their code, including their algorithms,   to inspection and modification;   	 Allowing  users,  rather  than  central  administra- tors, the ability to restructuring flows of transpar- ency and opacity;   	 Refusing to alter their technical or organizational   structures to accommodate advertisers;   	 Allowing for more play with online identity, espe-  cially in comparison with Facebook;   	 Experimenting  with  new  metaphors  and  means   of connections.  However, ASM  are  not  without  their  flaws.  Most of the work put into them appears to be  aimed at solving technical problems  i.e., the  problem of both network and American cen- tralization .  The  complexity  of  network  decentralization  often  makes  ASM  systems  technically  challenging  to  use.  Whereas  CSM such as Facebook and Twitter are now  so popular that there is a great deal of social  knowledge  on  how  use  them,  installing  or  running ASM can often be quite challenging  to  lay  users.  This  can  result  in  what  I  call  cultures  of  ‘techno-elitism’   Gehl,  2014a ,  where new users who ask for help are some- times  mocked  by  other,  more  experienced  users. Moreover, if ASM become popular  as  in the case of Ello in its early days , they can  run  into  scaling  problems  as  large  numbers  of  new  users  sign  up  and  overwhelm ASM  servers or communications protocols.  In addition, the political economy problem  of advertising is solved by many ASM merely  through simple refusal: ASM often don’t run  advertisements, but do little else to consider  financial viability. Less work has been done  in ASM to make these systems financially sta- ble, and in fact many ASM sites come and go   as  funding  depletes  and  coders  lose  interest   as has happened to many ASM sites, includ- ing Lorea, TalkOpen, Galaxy, and Crabgrass .  Perhaps  Ello’s  incorporation  as  a  ‘Public  Benefits  Corporation’  is  a  viable  economic  model, or it could be that ASM can follow in  Wikipedia’s footsteps and become non-profit  organizations funded through donations. Or,  there  may  be  a  new  model  emerging  in  an  as-yet largely unknown, experimental ASM.  Twister,  for  example,  allows  users  to  vol- unteer  spare  computing  cycles  to  verify  its  database, much in the same way that Bitcoin  verification works. At the very least, this rad- ically reduces the need for Twister to pay for  storage and computational power by sharing  these costs among users.  Perhaps most importantly, there are many  problematic  cultural  practices  that  ASM  have  not  directly  addressed.  For  example,  I  have  observed  that  the  intense  misogyny  and  racism  found  in Twitter   e.g.,  Mantilla,  2013   has  in  fact  migrated  to  some  ASM  platforms. Under the banner of ‘free speech,’  some users have taken to ASM to rail against  so-called  ‘Social  Justice  Warriors’  who  are  seen  as  ‘silencing’  voices   predominantly  of  white  men . Assuming  they  do  not  want  such practices, ASM administrators and users  must turn their attention away from technical  problems and begin to focus more and more  on  the  cultivation  of  particular  cultures  of  interaction. Often, however, the overarching  ideals  of  ‘free  speech’  and  ‘open  dialog’  –   many  times  coupled  with  technical  barriers  to  controlling  user  activities  –  make  ASM  administrators hesitant to challenge sexist or  racist speech.  Finally, the fact remains that ASM remain  less popular than CSM. The numbers of reg- istered  members  of  various ASM  I  cited  at  the  outset  of  this  chapter  are  far,  far  lower  than  the  reported  monthly  active  users  of  Facebook  and  Twitter.  The  problems  I’m  pointing  to  here  –  techno-elitism,  uncertain  funding,  and  hateful  speech  of  some  ASM  users  –  are  not  enough  to  explain  this  gap.  The simplest explanation here is that of the    344  network effect: the tendency for people to use  communication technologies because people  they know use them. In other words, people  are  on  CSM  because  colleagues,  friends,  brands,  and  celebrities  are,  and  people  are  not  on  ASM  because  colleagues,  friends,  brands, and celebrities aren’t. But even net- work effects are no guarantee that CSM will  always  remain  dominant.  It  is  possible  that  present  or  future  ASM  system  can  become  massively popular by combining new features  with emerging media practices  such as aug- mented reality, virtual reality, or the Internet  of  Things ,  thus  capturing  a  large  userbase  that continually attracts more and more users.  Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other CSM  were once small projects, after all, and their  dominance  was  never  certain.  One  thing  is  certain, however: if critical reverse engineers  don’t make ASM, we will never see a decen- tralized, open, more democratic alternative to  contemporary  CSM.  CSM  are  not  going  to  become open and democratic on their own.  It  is  here  that  we  academic  critics  can  help.  Comparative  research  between  CSM  and ASM, sustained ethnographic and social  scientific  study  of ASM,  the  documentation  and  elaboration  of  new  economic  models,  open participation by academics in ASM, and  above all meetings of mind between critical  coders and CSM critics can help to legitimate  and mature these systems. This, I would sug- gest, is the best path forward for those of us  who support contemporary alternative media  and media justice.

For more information about these and other  alternative  social  media,  see  the  S-MAP:   The  Social  Media  Alternatives  Project,  at  www.socialmediaalternatives.org  Diaspora*  URL: https:  diasporafoundation.org   Founded in 2010 by four students at New  York  University,  diaspora*  is  a  federated  social  networking  system.  Its  code  is  open  source and can be installed on any Web server.  Early in its history, it was hailed in the news  media as a ‘Facebook Killer.’ This was unfor- tunate, because it was too much to expect of  a brand-new system. However, despite dias- pora* not living up to that expectation, it has  steadily grown. Moreover, it has incorporated  as a non-profit in the United States.

GNU Social  URL: http:  www.gnu.org s social   by   Sponsored   the  Free  Software  Foundation,  GNU  social  is  a  Free  Software  package  that  can  be  installed  on  any  Web  server.  GNU  social  began  life  in  the  late- 2000s  as  Laconica,  before  being  renamed   StatusNet  and  finally  GNU  social.  GNU  social  is  a  microblogging  service.  A  nota- ble  example  of  GNU  social  in  action  is  the  Swedish  site  Quitter.se,  which  is  styled  to  mimic Twitter  and  thus  be  the  ‘methadone’  to Twitter’s ‘heroin’  Gehl, 2015a: 7 .

Twister  URL: http:  twister.net.co   Twister  was  created  by  Miguel  Freitas  in  reaction  to  US  National  Security  Agency  spying, as well as the need for activists and  protesters  to  have  decentralized  means  of  communication.  Working  as  a  peer-to-peer  system,  Twister  runs  on  both  the  Bittorrent  and Bitcoin protocols.  Academic paper on Twister: Freitas  2015 .  Ello  URL: ello.co   Ello  was  founded  in  2014.  It  received  a  great deal of attention in news coverage due to  its manifesto  quoted above  against advertis- ing in social media. Unlike other ASMs, Ello  is not open source, it is centralized, and in fact  it  is  incorporated,  albeit  as  a  ‘Public  Benefit  Corporation.’ Ello’s design is akin to Pinterest,  with an emphasis on graphics over text.  Galaxy2  URL: http:  w363zoq3ylux5rf5.onion   Founded  early  in  2015,  Galaxy2  is  social  network  running  as  a  Tor  hidden  service.  It  can only be accessed via Tor-based software  such as the Tor Browser Bundle. Despite being  hidden,  Galaxy2  has  grown  to  nearly  5,000  members. The site is built on Elgg, a popular  open-source social networking package.

Sone works much like Twitter: it uses   a   follower–followed  relationship  and  relies  on  short  posts.  Much  like  Galaxy2,  it  can- not be accessed with a standard browser; the  Freenet router is required.

Emerging  media forms offer alternate avenues for con- nection  and  expression.  In  addition,  they  sustain digital traces and relational memory  maps of evolving connections between indi- viduals in everyday life. These practices and  processes  are  not  only  important  to  under- standing  modalities  of  sociality,  but  are   integral  to  understanding  self-actualization  through sociability.  This  chapter  explores  personal  connec- tion  and  relational  maintenance  as  they  are  accomplished  through  social  media  today.  We examine these connections from a devel- opmental  perspective  of  interpersonal  com- munication,  which  envisions  interaction  as  becoming  more  personalized  and  complex  over  time   Parks,  2011b .  This  approach  arises from the study of the behaviors of rela- tional  dyads  and  focuses  on  social  aspects,  the life course, and the self. In this chapter,   we focus on informal interpersonal relation- ships, or friendship, as our model, as this is  perhaps the most common form of relational  engagement. Friendship is distinct from other  types of relationships due to its voluntary and  non-exclusive  nature;  it  contrasts  with  fam- ily relationships, which entail specific norms  and  obligations,  and  romantic  relationships,  which are exclusive and either have a finite  duration or convert to a familial relationship.  In this chapter, we address three major phases  of  relationship  development  as  they  occur  through the lens of social media: relationship  establishment or connection; relational man- agement  and  boundary  work;  and  relation- ship  dissolution  or  disconnection.  For  each  topic, we focus on how social media enable,  challenge  and  figure  in  the  negotiation  of  relationship and connection, and how perfor- mance  of  these  processes  connects  with  the  concept of the networked self.  We use the concept of the networked self  to describe modalities of sociality and iden- tity  performance  that  develop  across  online    354  and offline platforms, interconnected and not    Papacharissi,  2011 .  Contemporary  plat- forms  of  engagement,  regardless  of  their  materiality, support a sense of self that is net- worked: performed to networks and through  networks. Such platforms of engagement fre- quently invite acts of expression and connec- tion for the mere sake of doing so, no matter  how mundane or ordinary those acts may be.  As  these  acts  of  expression  and  connection  are performed to audiences, actual and imag- ined, identity becomes increasingly perform- ative. It must be understood that presentation as  a performance is a typically subconscious act,   rendered  as  we  piece  together  learned  behaviors  to  create  a  particular  impression   Schechner,  2013 .  It  is  this  increased  the- atricality  afforded  by  social  network  sites  –  the drama of performance – that individuals   frequently   Parks,  2011a .  Still,  performances  of  the  self  ena- ble  sociability,  and  for  the  performer,  these  socially  oriented  performances  must  carry  meaning for multiple publics and audiences  without  sacrificing  one’s  true  sense  of  self.  These polysemic performances not only con- tain many layers of meaning, but are remixed  and  remixable,  sampling  digital  traces  of  identity  to  piece  together  performative  por- traits  of  the  self  that  are  further  remixed  and  reinterpreted  by  multiple  audiences   and publics.  find  most  appealing   The  focus  on  friendship,  combined  with  the  emphasis  on  the  networked  self,  allows  us  to  blend  distinct  traditions  in  both  the  humanities  and  the  social  sciences  toward  understanding personal connections, relation- ships, and the self in contemporary societies.   Our  emphasis  on  connections,  relationships  and  the  self  is  essential  in  explicating  how  social  relations  are  formed,  grow,  and  are  re-imagined  through  social  media.  Yet  this  emphasis permits us to explore how connec- tions and relations with others play a part in  self-expression,  performance,  and  actual- ization. As  mediated  spaces  –  places  across  which these connections take form – evolve,  expression, presentations, and representations   of the relational self attain a distinct texture,   modality, and affect. It is these subtle adjust- ments  to  the  fundamentals  of  social  rela- tionships  that  we  are  keen  on  exploring  in  this chapter.  friends, folloWers, and   circles: The characTerisTics   of connecTion  Our line of thinking is informed by Wellman’s   2001   work  on  networked  individualism,  which describes relational forms of engage- ment  formed  around  looser  networks  and  giving  people  a  wider  variety  of  ways  to  address social needs. As Rainie and Wellman   2012   explain,  people  are  not  ‘hooked  on  gadgets but on each other,’ in modalities of  relational engagement that emanate from the  individual  as  the  autonomous  center,  and  involve  both  multiple  users  and  multi- threaded multi-tasking. People use technolo- gies  to  sustain  a  form  of  being  that  is  primarily  relational,  even  though,  on  occa- sion,  their  lives  may  be  oversaturated  with  technology   Gergen,  2009 .  The  networked  self  is  a  relational  self   Hogan  & Wellman,  2014 , the center of a network of independ- ent  and  overlapping  social  connections  and  expressive modalities.  Thus, in its simplest form, a relationship is  the connectivity of a dyad, or two individu- als linked through some context. In a tradi- tional sense, how we characterize connection  between individuals depends on the relation- ship’s  qualities.  Such  qualities  include  the  level of intimacy between the two individu- als,  which  typically  falls  on  a  continuum  from  passing  acquaintance  to  close  friend,  or the degree to which a relationship is pub- lic and known to others. Relational contexts  are important to understanding relationships  as well, as they often reflect and suggest the  forms  of  interaction  that  take  place;  some  familiar  forms  are  work  colleagues,  school  mates, kin, and romantic partners.   our networked selves  355  For  the  networked  individual,  especially  through the use of social media, relationships  take on a tangible quality, as they are inscribed  through  publicly-articulated  lists  of  connec- tion that can be viewed and traversed by oth- ers  Ellison & boyd, 2013 . Typically, these  are  designated  as  ‘Friends,’  ‘Connections,’  or  ‘Followers Following,’  depending  on   the  platforms  through  which  one  engages.  These graphical representations of individu- als’  social  networks  have  spurred  consid- erable  research  on  sociability  and  social  connection   e.g.,  Backstrom  &  Kleinberg,  2014 . However, they distort representations  of the totality of an individual’s social con- nections in two important ways. First, these  lists  only  reflect  connections  between  indi- viduals who participate in a particular social  medium; hence, relationships that are impor- tant or significant to the individual may not  be represented if one partner is not a platform  user. For example, though a relationship with  a  grandparent  may  be  important  to  a  uni- versity student, this relationship may not be  reflected  in  the  student’s  Facebook  Friends,  as the grandparent may not participate in the  medium.  Second,  some  important  relational  qualities, including its context and strength,  are not captured in the ‘friends list’ or list of  followers. The invisibility of these qualities,  coupled  with  the  ability  for  relationships  to  be  unidirectional,  distinguish  social  media  connection from other forms of interpersonal  relationships, and reinforce that ‘friends’ on  social media are not the same as ‘friends’ in  the everyday sense  boyd, 2006 .  Relational Context  Relational  contexts  provide  information  on  how a given relationship is situated within an  individual’s network. These give relevance to  connection and typically reflect an individu- al’s social spheres  Simmel, 1955 ; typically,  these  contexts  reflect  how  an  individual  ‘knows’ another, such as a through common  worship  or  school  community,  or  they  may   reflect a particular relational focus such as a  place or activity  Feld & Carter, 1998 . In the  physical  world,  individuals  use  time  and  space to separate those contexts of their lives  which may be incompatible with one another   Donath & boyd, 2004; Nippert-Eng, 1995 ,  keeping  separate,  for  example,  professional  colleagues  from  school  friends.  In  social  media,  relational  contexts  are  not  visible  to  others, and, perhaps more importantly for the  users  of  these  media,  relational  contexts  become  jumbled  and  re-mixed  in  these   digital spaces.  This melding of contexts has relevance as  information about the self and one’s relation- ships  is  created,  commented  on,  and  shared  between  individuals.  Deemed  as  ‘context  collapse’  for  the  individual   Marwick  &  boyd,  2014 ,  this  merging  of  audiences  and  relational contexts into a single digital space  requires  adjustments  such  as  segregating  relationships  to  specific  platforms   Quinn,  2013; Wesch, 2009 , curtailing the release of  information about the self  Marwick & boyd,  2011 ,  or  even  creating  multiple  profiles  within a single social media platform to man- age  identity  within  groups  of  connections   Stutzman & Hartzog, 2012 . To aid users in  re-introducing context to their relationships,  several  social  media  platforms  have  intro- duced ‘groups,’ ‘lists,’ and ‘circles’ into their  functionality. Grouping functionality benefits  users  by  allowing  for  higher  granularity  in  their consumption and dissemination of plat- form content. For example, the user can select  specific  groups  of  connection  with  which  to share a photo or comment. But grouping  functions provide little direction for outsiders  for determining another’s relational contexts,  as these are often not visible to others.  One  additional  dimension  of  relational  context  can  potentially  be  found  in  the  use  of  a  specific  platform  for  connection.  The  meaning of a connection often varies between  platforms,  and  is  guided  by  the  platform’s  focus,  the  social  norms  which  predominate,  and  the  platform’s  functionality.  For  exam- ple, a connection on LinkedIn may connote    356  a  professional  context  as  the  information  highlighted  on  this  platform  is  relevant  to  employment  and  commerce.  Alternatively,  following  a  Friend  on  Pinterest  suggests  a  different  relational  context,  as  these  often  revolve  around  a  common  personal  interest  in a hobby or topic.  Relational Strength  The strength of a relationship is also a defin- ing  quality  of  the  personal  connections  we  sustain, and social media platforms typically  lack  information  on  this  dimension.  Both  strong and weak relationships are important  to an individual; strong ties  i.e., close friends  and  family   share  resources  and  support,  while  weak  ties   acquaintances  and  weaker  contacts   expose  an  individual  to  different  experiences  and  information   Granovetter,  1973 .  Strong  relationships  use  multiple  media  forms  to  reinforce  their  relationships   Haythornthwaite,  2005 ,  and  social  media  technologies fit into this prototype by provid- ing an additional means to communicate and  maintain  social  connection.  Social  media  also  allow  individuals  to  maintain  weaker  connections more easily, permitting a larger  number  of  connections  to  be  maintained   Donath,  2007 .  This  ability  to  create  and  maintain weaker ties is considered a potential  advantage of social media use; social media  allow  users  to  passively  monitor  weak  con- nections  without  significant  effort,  and  thus  leaves  open  the  possibility  that  weak  rela- tionships  will  become  stronger,  and  thus  more  valuable,  over  time   Levin,  Walter  &  Murnighan, 2010; Pearson, 2009 .  Directionality  One additional characteristic of social media  connection is directionality, that is, whether a  relationship is acknowledged by only one or  by  both  individuals.  Among  social  media  platforms,  relationships  can  be  mutual    bi-directional, with both individuals consent- ing to the creation of the connection, or uni- directional,  initiated  by  one  individual  and  not  reciprocated  by  the  other.  Mutual  con- nections are typically referred to as ‘friends,’  ‘connections,’ or ‘contacts,’ and are acknowl- edged by both individuals in the relationship;  they are commonly found in social network  sites.  Unidirectional  connections  character- ize  the  initiating  individuals  as  ‘fans,’  ‘fol- lowers,’ or ‘subscribers,’ and are initiated by  one individual but do not need to be recipro- cated  by  the  other;  these  are  often  found  in  platforms that emphasize the sharing of user- generated  content,  such  as  microblogs  or  photo video sharing applications.  It is assumed that mutual relationships are  more  durable   Li,  Zhang  &  Bao,  2012 ,  as  they evidence an affirmation of the relation- ship  from  both  partners.  While  some  argue  that unidirectional ties may be viewed as an  initial step in establishing a mutual relation- ship   e.g.,  Westcott  &  Owen,  2013 ,  they  are  probably  closer  in  nature  to  latent  ties   Haythornthwaite,  2002 ,  or  relationships  that hold the potential for interaction in that  they  exist  technically,  but  require  a  further  reciprocating  step  of  some  form,  such  as  a  ‘follow back’ before they can be considered  to have true substance.  making friends: The dynamics  of connecTion  Traditional theories of interpersonal commu- nication tend to examine relational trajecto- ries as having a beginning, middle and end;  they focus on relational development once a  connection between two individuals has been  made. Physical proximity, that is, the ability  to ‘bump into’ one another, or social homo- phily,  having  similar  tastes  and  interests,  or  both, are considered to be the key underlying  factors  for  a  connection  opportunity.  This  approach  to  understanding  relationships  tends  to  diminish  the  role  of  third  parties    our networked selves  357   such as a mutual friend  and social proxim- ity  being a friend of a friend  for initial con- nection,  although  these  factors  are  often  critical for relationship establishment  Parks,  2007,  2011b .  Social  media  have  made  the  role of third parties and friends-of-friends in  relational  establishment  more  visible,  if  not  more  pronounced,  and  have  highlighted  the  role  that  network  structure  plays  in  the  for- mation of interpersonal relationships.  For the networked individual, social prox- imity  and  third  parties  are  easily  discerned  as one navigates networks of visible connec- tions  in  social  media  platforms.  Individuals  use a variety of strategies to find connections  on social media, but three important mecha- nisms stand out: searching names of contacts  using the platform’s embedded search engine,  relying on recommendations provided by the  platform’s algorithm, or examining the con- nection lists of existing contacts.  The  use  of  embedded  search  engines  to  find connections in social media sites is often  more successful than relying on independent  search  engines.  Because  social  media  pro- files often contain personal details about an  individual  –  employer,  educational  institu- tions, relationships with others – these tools  enable a contextual form of search, associat- ing more than just a name with an individual.  This enables searches to be more precise and  accurate, and provides more certainty for the  searcher that the ‘found’ individual is defini- tively  the  correct  and  targeted  person.  For  example, a user may search for people from  their  hometown  or  who  graduated  from  the  same  high  school  to  find  friends  from  their  teenage years.  Social  matching  algorithms,  such  as  Facebook’s People You May Know, provide  an automated form of this contextual search  by incorporating ‘friends of friend’ informa- tion into the recommendation  Zhang et al.,  2015 . The automated analysis of the larger  network of an individual’s connections, and  the  resulting  systemic  recommendations,  facilitate  and  encourage  relationship  forma- tion. Experiments suggest that the presence of   high-quality algorithms result in larger con- nection networks for social media users, but  also that this connection activity is enhanced  when keywords from an individual’s profile,  such  as  musical  interests,  or  their  posting  activity,  such  as  the  location  of  where  pho- tos are taken, are matched between potential  connections  Chen et al., 2009 . These friend- finding algorithms perform particularly well  for locating known contacts who are not yet  connected on a given social media platform,  but  are  not  as  adept  at  sourcing  novel  or   new  connections  for  an  individual   Chen  et al., 2009 .  Early  research  focused  on  the  ways  in  which  internet-based  technologies  helped  overcome  spatial  and  temporal  limitations  and thus facilitate connections between indi- viduals that would otherwise not be possible  or  practical   Baym,  2015 .  These  possibili- ties have come to fruition, as approximately  39%  of  social  media  users  today  are  con- nected  with  at  least  one  individual  whom  they have not met in person  Duggan et al.,  2014 . Nevertheless, social media, and social  network  sites  in  particular,  largely  replicate  existing  offline  social  connection  patterns   Gershon,  2011;  Mayer  &  Puller,  2008;  Steinfield,  Ellison,  Lampe  &  Vitak,  2012 ,  and  offline  friendships  continue  to  be  per- ceived  as  higher  in  quality  than  relation- ships  initiated  online  or  even  those  that  are  initiated online and move offline  Antheunis,  Valkenburg & Peter, 2012 . When compared  to other possible uses of social media, such  as seeking social information or maintaining  existing relationships, its use to initiate new  relationships  is  low   Ellison,  Steinfield  &   Lampe,  2011 ,  and  correspondingly,  the  size of offline networks do not appear to be  impacted  through  social  media  use   Pollett,  Roberts & Dunbar, 2011 .  Finally, the digital traces that remain from  social  media  use,  such  as  user  activity  logs  or  ‘snapshots’  of  an  individual’s  network  taken  at  various  points  in  time,  have  pro- vided  enhanced  opportunity  for  examining  connection  refusals,  or  those  requests  for    358  connection  in  a  social  media  platform  that  are either denied or ignored by the recipient.  Though sometimes grouped with practices of  disconnection  e.g., Light, 2014 , the avoid- ance  i.e., ‘ignoring’ a friend request  or an  outright refusal of connection with others is  frequently  boundary  work,  or  a  mechanism  to  maintain  and  keep  one’s  various  social  spheres separate  Malinen, 2015; Tokunaga,  2011; Wisniewski, Lipford & Wilson, 2012 .  Connection refusal on social media typically  results  in  stress  to  the  face-to-face  relation- ship  McLaughlin & Vitak, 2011; Tokunaga,  2011   as  there  is  a  tangible  quality  to  an  incomplete  connection;  moreover,  these  relational  consequences  highlight  how  dif- ferences  between  traditional  face-to-face  and new online social norms associated with  social media use are shaping relationships.  birThday reminders and  neWsfeeds: relaTional  managemenT and   boundary Work  The convergence of technology and the soci- ality  produced  through  social  media  use  result  in  the  ability  to  access  and  distribute  social  resources  among  local  and  remote  spheres  of  family,  friends,  and  acquaint- ances,  no  matter  how  loosely  connected   Papacharissi, 2011 . Relationships grow and  are maintained through communication, and  individuals  spend  more  time  maintaining  relationships than in either their initiation or  termination  Duck, 1988 . Social media have  provided  an  additional  tool  for  individuals’  communication  media  repertoires   Watson- Manheim & Bélanger, 2007 . They empower  the individual with more ways to communi- cate and thus maintain relationships, but also  provide  an  ambient  awareness  of  social  information with which to nourish relational  communication.  In  the  same  vein,  Stafford  and  Canary   1991   identified  a  typology  of  relational   maintenance  strategies  between  romantic  partners, and later extended this to friend and  kin relationships  Canary, Stafford, Hause &  Wallace,  1993 . They  found  that  individuals  use  ten  primary  strategies  to  maintain  rela- tionships,  such  as  being  positive,  open,  and  assuring;  they  share  tasks  and  social  net- works, participate in joint activities, and make  contact via cards letters calls. Sometimes they  use avoidance and other anti-social behaviors,  and  they  use  humor.  All  of  these  strategies  are  performed  through  social  media  plat- forms: posting content and sending messages  to connections  positivity ; sharing news and  disclosing  important  information  about  one- self  openness ; sending congratulations and  listing  others  as  ‘top  friends’   assurances ;  coordinating  events  via  chat  and  messaging   sharing  tasks ;  adding  friends  of  friends,  especially those of a romantic partner  social  networks ; commenting on others’ posts and  tagging  photos   joint  activities ;  using  chat  and messaging functions to communicate as  an  additional  medium   cards letters calls ;  blocking  content  or  not  responding  to  mes- sages  posted  by  others   avoidance ;  deliber- ately posting photos or comments intended to  provoke  anti-social ; and posting funny con- tent  or  ‘poking’  others,  a  playful  feature  of  Facebook intended to say hello or gain atten- tion,   humor    Bryant  &  Marmo,  2009 .  In  addition, users of social media identify ‘social  surveillance,’ or the use of social media plat- forms to monitor the events and activities of  their  connections,  as  an  additional  strategy  to support relational interaction, by using the  information found therein as a social lubricant  to  launch  conversation  or  strengthen  rela- tionships   Bryant  &  Marmo,  2009;  Lampe,  Ellison & Steinfield, 2006 . The significance  of the plurality of relational strategies availa- ble to people is considerable, given the options  available  for  creating  and  sustaining  rela- tionships. These  options  support  an  ambient   form  of  sociability,  which  not  only  sustains  ‘always  on’  social  environments,  but  also  reconciles our need for individual autonomy  with our inherent desire for social connection.   our networked selves  359  Architectural Qualities  Modalities of ambient, always-on sociability  are further enhanced by the architectural fea- tures of the social environments sustained by  these  platforms.  When  used  for  social  pur- poses, use of the net-based platforms results  in  larger  numbers  of  social  ties   Hampton,  Sessions & Her, 2011; Zhao, 2006 , and this  is  true  of  social  media  as  well   Hampton,  Sessions-Goulet,  Rainie  &  Purcell,  2011 .  Dunbar’s   2012   social  brain  hypothesis  states  that  cognitive  capacity  and  neocortex  size  limits  complex  social  interaction,  and  therefore the size of social networks. He con- cludes that the ‘natural’ social group size for  humans  is  approximately  150  individuals   Dunbar,  2012 .  But  individuals  maintain  larger, and sometimes much larger, networks  via social media platforms. For example, the  average  number  of  connections  that  a  Facebook  user  maintains  is  338   Smith,  2014 .  This  suggests  that  the  mediation  afforded  by  social  network  sites  may  aid  in  maintaining  a  greater  number  of  relation- ships, although many of these do not involve  regular  interaction   Marlow,  2009 .  Social  media  possess  key  features  that  facilitate  maintaining  larger  networks  and  extending  an individual’s ability to partake in complex  sociability. These important qualities include  capacity  for  conversation,  asynchronicity,  persistence, and social reminding.  First,  social  media  enable  individuals  to  broadcast  information  via  news  streams,  tweets, and group shares. Importantly, how- ever, this ability to broadcast is coupled with  a  capacity  for  reaction  from  others.  Social  media  platforms  literally  invite  interaction  by providing the ability to comment on, like,  favorite, and rebroadcast posted content. This  coupling of these two qualities is extraordi- narily  powerful:  it  enables  conversation  to  take  place  at  once  between  individuals  and  groups  Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy &  Silvestre, 2011 . Unlike unmediated conver- sation, which involves a maximum of about  four individuals  Dunbar, Duncan & Nettle,   1995 , social media conversation entails the  flow of content across social media platforms  and  the  mixing  and  remixing  of  local  and  remote  social  spheres   Papacharissi,  2011 ;  this  effectively  expands  the  conversation  into  many-to-many  interaction.  The  ability  to  monitor  multiple  conversation  streams,  which  often  incorporate  the  activities  and  life  events  of  weaker  relationships,  without  significant  effort  or  cost  keeps  weaker  ties  in  existence  and  fosters  their  maintenance   Vitak, 2014 .  However,  this  ability  to  broadcast  infor- mation, especially about the self, may come  with  some  cost  to  some  relationships  too.  Though  self-disclosure  has  long  been  asso- ciated  with  increasing  relational  intimacy   Altman & Taylor, 1973 , self-disclosure via  social media can negatively impact relational  quality.  In  a  study  of  dyadic  relationships,  self-disclosure  activity  on  Facebook  was  negatively associated with both relational sat- isfaction and liking  McEwan, 2013 . Social  media disclosures have the potential to make  one’s  connections  ‘reluctant  confidants’   Petronio, 2002 , or involuntary recipients of  personal and or private information, and the  broadcasting of these messages may be per- ceived  as  different  from  interpersonal  inter- action.  This  is  an  important  area  for  future  study,  as  it  may  highlight  ways  in  which  information  flows  through  these  platforms  impact  relational  quality  in  both  advanta- geous and deleterious ways.  A second important characteristic of social  media as it relates to relational maintenance  is  asynchronicity,  which  is  tied  to  the  uni- directional  nature  of  information  transmis- sion. Because information is sent in only one  direction at a time, users recognize a time lag  between  the  sending  and  receiving  of  mes- sages and information. This lag allows indi- viduals to carefully craft the information being  sent  for  a  desired  effect   Tong,  Kashian  &   Walther, 2011 , permitting the ability to edit,  revise  or  even  delete  before  being  seen  by  the  recipient  and  thus  preserves  the  ability  to maintain a consistent presentation of self.    360  Unlike  with  synchronous  media,  such  as  a  telephone,  immediate  responses  and  inter- action  are  not  expected  when  using  social  media platforms, giving users greater control  over  their  disclosures  and  maximizing  their  ability to generate a desired image.  In  addition,  because  social  media  permit  users to compartmentalize conversations via  threading and the use of hashtags, the asyn- chronous  exchanges  permit  multicommuni- cating   Reinsch,  Turner  &  Tinsley,  2008 ,  or the simultaneous participation in multiple  exchanges  at  once.  Asynchronicity  places  the tempo of conversation under the control  of participants; it enables the ability to catch  up with conversations that transpired in one’s  absence, or while being engaged with others,  and affords users some degree of time opti- mization in the maintenance of interpersonal  relationships. It should be noted that the abil- ity to handle multiple conversations at once  is  not  unique  to  social  media,  as  individu- als can use technologies such as email, chat  and phone at the same time. However, social  media  permit  these  multiple  conversation  possibilities to exist in a single social space,  by offering multiple communication modali- ties such as messaging, wall posting and chat  all within a single platform.  are   expressions   Persistence  refers  to  the  ways  in  which  ‘online  automatically  recorded  and  archived’   boyd,  2010:  46 ,  in  other  words,  the  ways  activity  on  social  media  is  captured,  preserved,  and  made  available  through  time.  Social  media  con- versations  are  persistent,  rendering  them  accessible  at  other  places  and  at  different  times than when they transpired; this quality  also  makes  such  conversations  searchable,  browse-able, replayable, and visual  Erikson,  1999 .  Persistent  conversation  is  difficult  to  remove  once  posted,  but  this  accessibility  also allows people to add or expand to conver- sations over time  Treem & Leonardi, 2012 ,  enabling  relational  memories  to  be  re-lived  and  remembered  and  sustaining  relational  closeness  Human & Lane, 2008 . Moreover,  persistence  extends  to  the  availability  of   social  media  profiles,  which  maintain  a  single  ‘social  address’  through  which  con- nection  might  be  maintained;  profiles  and  connection persist in social media despite job  changes,  name  changes  prompted  by  mar- riage and divorce, and geographic relocation,  factors  which  contribute  to  relational  decay    Rose, 1984 .  for  maintaining   Finally, social media often perform social  reminding  functions,  as  algorithms  and  system-generated  prompts  nudge  users  to  partake  in  the  everyday  relational  practices  necessary  relationships.  Birthday and event reminders, updates from  connections that appear in the newsfeed, and  the  highlighting  of  timeline  anniversaries  are  digital  artifacts  that  serve  to  encapsu- late memory of the relationship and keep the  ‘promise’ of the connection alive  Shklovski,  Kraut & Cummings, 2008 . Facebook goes as  far as to systematically aggregate dyadic rela- tional activity, such as photos in which two  friends are tagged, their comment exchanges,  and information about the beginning of their  connection; while this feature provides a pro- grammatic vision of the relationship and its  importance   Bucher,  2013 ,  it  does  serve  as  a tangible reminder of the relational connec- tion.  These  mechanisms  extend  an  individ- ual’s  knowledge  management  and  memory  capabilities  and  enable  the  maintenance  of  shared  interests  and  knowledge   Dunbar,  2012 , elements critical to relational quality,  and can assist in maintaining a minimal level  of  contact  to  sustain  connection  when  one- to-one  conversation  is  infrequent   Bryant,  Marmo & Ramirez, 2011 .  Boundary Work and the Rules   of Social Media Connection  Social boundaries include the spatial, tempo- ral  and  relational  limits  that  define  us   as  separate  from  one  another   Ashforth,  Kreiner  &  Fugate,  2000;  Zerubavel,  1991 .  Boundaries  are  especially  important  to  rela- tional development  Altman & Taylor, 1983     our networked selves  361  the   integrity  of   and  to  the  regulation  of  privacy   Petronio,  2002 ,  and  thus  the  ways  in  which  they  are  created and sustained are critical to relation- ship management for two reasons: they main- tain  individuals  and  relationships, and they also frame how infor- mation  flows  between  individuals   Parks,  2011b .  Boundary  work  refers  to  the  strate- gies,  principles,  and  practices  by  which  we  create  and  maintain  these  boundaries,   and  research  in  this  area  tends  to  center   on  cultural  categories  and  role  identity   Nippert-Eng, 1996 .  The boundary work executed within social  media  entails  not  only  the  performance  of  one’s  identity,  but  also  the  ability  to  edit  and  redact  it  across  multiple  and  converged  audiences   Papacharissi,  2011 .  As  connec- tions consist of family, friends and acquaint- ances,  strong  and  weak  ties,  in  a  singular  social space, the networked individual must  navigate  these  multiple  audiences  without  sacrificing  coherence  or  continuity  in  self  presentation.  But  because  the  networked  individual may be performing multiple roles  in  multiple  relational  contexts,  recognition  of  the  appropriate  set  of  boundary  expecta- tions  may  be  somewhat  challenging   Parks,  2011b . Individuals often lack control of how  information flows through social media plat- forms,  and  this  can  sometimes  result  in  the  communication of decontextualized content,  in  disclosures  that  travel  beyond  the  imag- ined audience  Litt, 2012 , or in context col- lapse  Marwick & boyd, 2014 . In addition,  the  broadcast  quality  of  social  media  plat- forms intersects with spatial boundary man- agement processes, because it alters the level  of control an individual has over the intended  audience  for  disclosure   Tufekci,  2008 .  In  turn,  because  information  controls  reflect  such unpredictability, the ways in which indi- viduals  manage  identity,  interact  with  one  another, and negotiate privacy are shaped in  two important ways: boundary management  extends beyond individual control to become  a collective process; and the ‘rules of friend- ship,’  or  the  social  norms  and  expectancies   regarding social relationships, become highly  relevant to how weaker relational forms are  negotiated and maintained.  Karr-Wisniewski,  Wilson  and  Richter- Lipford   2011   identified  five  areas  that  challenge  an  individual’s  boundary  regula- tion processes in social media environments:  networks,  territories,  disclosures,  relation- ships, and interactions. Networks refer to our  social  spheres,  which  often  are  distinct  and  sometimes require us to play roles that con- flict with one another. Preventing these from  overlapping,  such  as  keeping  work  connec- tions  isolated  from  family  connections,  is  an  important  boundary  control  mechanism.  Territories refer to the ways in which individ- uals  claim  their  own  ‘space,’  by  controlling  the information that flows across and through  social media spaces; individuals control these  flows by limiting what is visible in one’s own  newsfeed or restricting the commenting that  is permitted on one’s profile. Unintended dis- closure,  or  the  revelation  of  information  to  unanticipated  audiences,  is  a  third  area  that  challenges  an  individual’s  boundaries;  indi- viduals  attempt  to  prevent  or  contain  unin- tended disclosure through the use of privacy  settings or by restricting the information that  is  shared  to  specific  groups  or  individuals.  Relationships,  or  the  connection  with  oth- ers,  are  a  source  of  boundary  permeability  and  sometimes  are  seen  as  a  reflection  of  the individual; a decision to connect discon- nect with an individual and the use of group- ing  functionality  are  both  mechanisms  for  bounding interaction. Finally, limiting inter- actions with others provides the most direct  mechanism for boundary control, and can be  accomplished by disabling the ability of oth- ers to tag photos or blocking contact with spe- cific  individuals  altogether.  Taken  together,  these boundary control processes are used to  preserve  and  maintain  identity  and  regulate  privacy. However, these mechanisms operate  at the level of the individual and, while a sig- nificant way to control identity and privacy,  are often underpowered in the convergent and  fluid spaces of social media. To accomplish    362  greater  control  over  identity  and  privacy  in  social media spaces, a collaborative approach  is frequently required.  Petronio’s  theory  of  communication  pri- vacy  management  identifies  that  privacy  management, and therefore the regulation of  social boundaries, is a social process that is  based on rules and norms that operate at the  individual, dyadic and group level  Petronio,  2002 , and these requirements are amplified  in  social  media  spaces.  Individuals  often  learn  the  norms  of  social  media  platforms  by  watching  the  behavior  of  others   Burke,  Marlow  &  Lento,  2009 ,  and  thus  learn  and  rely  on  explicit  and  implicit  collabora- tive  behaviors  to  enact  boundaries  in  a  net- worked  environment   Lampinen,  Lehtinen,  Lehmuskallio  & Tamminen,  2011 .  Explicit  behaviors  might  include  asking  another’s  permission  before  posting  certain  informa- tion,  such  as  a  photo  online,  while  implicit  behaviors  may  include  self-censoring  infor- mation that might compromise another, such  as not sharing photos of a weeknight party.  The  concept  of   ‘networked  privacy’   Marwick & boyd, 2014  contextualizes this  idea  within  the  social  media  environment.  Marwick and boyd effectively argue that the  multiple contexts of audiences and the tech- nical  architecture  of  social  media  platforms  alter  mechanisms  for  disclosure.  Because  social  media  are  networked,  older  models  that envision privacy as a process of control- ling  access  to  information  are  incomplete;  instead, new emphasis is placed on the impor- tance  of  social  coordination  to  accomplish  privacy. According to Marwick and boyd, pri- vacy is best maintained through shared social  norms, yet social media platforms are poorly  equipped to support such collaboration with  others;  instead  this  coordination  activity,  both  as  preventative  and  corrective  meas- ures,  often  takes  place  outside  social  media  spaces, out of sight and to more private media   Wisniewski et al., 2012 .  Despite  this,  the  norms  related  to  social  boundary regulation in social media do appear  to  be  coalescing  into  recognizable  patterns    Lampinen  et  al.,  2011;  McLaughlin  &   Vitak, 2011; Peluchette, Karl & Fertig, 2013 .  Argyle  and  Henderson   1984   explored  the  ‘rules’ that are significant to relational devel- opment, and found agreement on four general  rules  that  apply  to  all  forms  of  friend  rela- tionships.  Unsurprisingly,  these  rules  center  on  social  boundary  control:  don’t  criticize  in  public;  keep  confidences;  don’t  criticize  other relationships; and respect privacy. They  found  that  these  general  rules  were  essen- tial  in  order  for  non-friend  relationships  to  develop into friendships, and that additional  rules  relating  to  reciprocal  communication  and support became important to sustaining  friendship once it was established  Argyle &  Henderson, 1984 .  Bryant  and  Marmo   2012   explored  how  these  rules  applied  in  social  media  contexts  and  found,  similarly,  that  ‘rules  of  friend- ship’ facilitate relationship stability and miti- gate  inter-relational  conflict. Application  of  these rules varies with the level of the rela- tionship,  for  example,  close  friends  may  be  held  to  stricter  adherence  of  the  rules  than  casual friends or acquaintances. They found  the influence of social media has led to both  a  focus  on  the  appropriateness  of  various  communication channels and the importance  of  impression  management  for  the  self  and  friend  connections.  The  most  significant  rules  center  on  requirements  for  recipro- cal  communication,  respecting  the  social  boundaries of the other person when posting  content,  and  communicating  outside  social  media  platforms   Bryant  &  Marmo,  2012 ;  they  emphasize  relationship  maintenance  through  activities  performed  through  social  media, but at the same time acknowledge the  importance  of  interaction  outside  the  social  media environment.  Interestingly, social media users are more  apt to sever contact or delete a weaker con- nection  that  compromises  one’s  self-image   Bryant  &  Marmo,  2012;  McLaughlin  &  Vitak,  2011 .  This  differs  from  strategies  used  with  close  friends,  where  confronta- tion  or  further  conversation  appears  to  be    our networked selves  363  the  accepted  process  for  dealing  with  con- flict and relational decline  Rose & Serafica,  1986 . As  individuals  are  more  sensitive  to  the negative consequences of social exchange  at earlier stages in the relational development  process   Hays,  1989 ,  Bryant  and  Marmo’s   2012   findings  suggest  that  the  social  media  environment  influences  processes  of  relational  development:  the  emphasis  on  communication  outside  the  social  media  environment  suggests  that  while  relation- ships of lesser strength might be maintained  via social media platforms in ways not pos- sible  without  such  mediation,  realization  of  their  potential  for  stronger  connection  may  be  constrained  without  supplemental  forms  of interactivity or, in other words, interaction  outside the social media environment. This is  further evidence of boyd’s  2006  notion that  ‘friends’ on social media are not the same as  ‘friends’ in the everyday sense.  unfriending: The arT of  relaTionship dissoluTion  Our  relationships  vary  in  temporality,  both  by  their  duration,  or  how  long  they  last,  as  well  as  in  the  rhythms  by  which  they  strengthen  and  weaken  over  time.  In  the  strictest  sense,  relationships  end  when  the  partners no longer have contact or influence  each  other  in  any  way   Parks,  2007 .  In  unmediated contexts, these endings occur for  a  variety  of  reasons:  physical  separation,  as  when partners relocate geographically away  from one another; replacement by new rela- tional partners; dislike, as when one partner’s  behaviors,  criticisms  or  betrayals  break  the  relational trust; and life events, such as gain- ing  a  romantic  partner  or  having  children   Rose,  1984;  Rose  &  Serafica,  1986 .  The  visibility  of  connection  enabled  by  social  media platforms makes processes of discon- nection  similarly  visible,  which  in  turn  sculpts the practices surrounding relationship  terminations and dissolutions.  Looking  at  social  media  activity  from  a  rhetorical  perspective  emphasizes  that  com- munication  is  a  goal-directed  and  strategic  activity,  and  this  is  particularly  true  with  regard to the end of a friendship. From this  vantage point, three stages of this process are  relevant:  the  personal  decision-making  that  leads up to the decision to end a relationship;  implementation of this decision  typically, we  view this as a breakup ; and the public pres- entation, to our broader social networks, that  the relationship has ended  Baxter, 1987 .  The  personal  decision-making  stage  of  relationship  dissolution  involves  an  indi- vidual taking assessment of the relationship  and why it is dissatisfactory  Baxter, 1987 .  Interviews  with  users  find  that  disconnec- tion  on  social  media  platforms  is  based  on  both  online  and  offline  reasons.  The  online  reasons center on the posting of content and  include  reasons  such  as  too  many  or  fre- quent  unimportant  posts,  polarizing  posts,  inappropriate  posts,  and  everyday  life  posts  about eating habits or children  Kwak, Chun  &  Moon,  2011;  Malinen,  2015;  Sibona  &  Walczak, 2011 . Offline reasons for discon- nection were typically due to specific disap- proved  behaviors  or  significant  changes  in  the relationship; interestingly, disconnection  for  these  behavioral  reasons  increases  with  greater  offline  contact  and  length  of  social  media use  Sibona & Walczak, 2011 .  The decision to disconnect on social media  also  considers  the  circumstances  of  a  rela- tionship’s beginning too. There is some evi- dence  that  relationship  initiators   i.e.,  those  making  the  initial  friend  request   are  more  frequently disconnected than those receiving  the  connection  request,  and  those  receiving  a  connection  request  more  frequently  make  the  decision  to  disconnect  the  relationship   Sibona & Walczak, 2011 . This tracks with  research on patterns of connection behaviors:  some users report that it is easier to accept a  connection request from someone they have  met, and then disconnect, rather than appear  rude  or  unsociable   McLaughlin  &  Vitak,  2011 . Alternatively, studies of social media    364  use among older adults suggest that the deci- sion to disconnect is viewed unfavorably as  individuals age  Quinn, 2013, 2014 , leading  to  reduced  levels  of  disconnection  activity   Madden,  2012 .  More  work  is  required  to  understand  the  factors  which  influence  dis- connection decision-making in these media. The second stage of relationship termina- tion is decision implementation, or the stage  in which the disconnection is actively negoti- ated  Baxter, 1987 . Unlike unmediated con- texts,  whereby  disconnection  is  negotiated  between the partners, users confer relational  disconnection  directly  with  social  media  platforms, and not the other individual; direct  negotiation with the other person may or may  not  take  place,  depending  on  the  context  of  the  unmediated  relationship.  Disconnection  of  social  media  relationships  is  not  uncom- mon, particularly for weak connections, and  typically  results  from  connection  being  lost  over time, relationships that are not perceived  as  close,  or  an  interpersonal  rift  such  as  a  break up or quarrel  Malinen, 2015 . Women  and younger persons are more likely to dis- connect  than  other  groups  of  social  media  users  Madden, 2012 .  Prior  to  the  advent  of  social  media,  researchers  relied  on  self-disclosure  to  lend  visibility to the processes of friendship termi- nation; however, network logs and traces of  digital  connectivity  have  sparked  new  ways  to view these activities, providing new insight  into how relationships termination is accom- plished.  Factors  such  as  embeddedness,  or  whether  partners  share  common  friends   Martin  &  Yeung,  2006 ,  and  homophily,  or  similarity  among  partners   McPherson,  Smith-Lovin  &  Cook,  2001 ,  factor  impor- tantly  in  whether  a  relationship  ends.  Logs  of  social  network  site  activity  reinforce  the  importance of these factors, and further high- light  that  some  common  personality  traits,  such  as  extraversion  and  neuroticism,  also  contribute  reduced  levels  of  disconnection   Quercia, Bodaghi & Crowcroft, 2012 ; this  holds true for both social media platforms that  feature mutual connections  i.e., Friends , as   well as directed platforms, or those that permit  unidirectional  connection   i.e.,  Followers .  Tie  reciprocity,  or  cases  where  unidirec- tional  relationships  are  ‘followed  back,’  is  important to predicting tie persistence as well   Kivran-Swaine, Govindan & Naaman, 2011;  Xu,  Huang,  Kwak  &  Contractor,  2013 .  While  it  is  relevant  that  research  on  social  media  has  confirmed  the  findings  of  prior  work  on  friendship  termination  in  unmedi- ated contexts, it will be important for future  work to uncover additional factors that might  contribute to the end of relationships.  Whereas   the  decision   implementation  unbounds  a  relationship  from  the  inside,  the public presentation unbounds a relation- ship  from  the  outside   Baxter,  1987 . These  involve actions or reactions that verify the dis- solution of relationships, and on social media  platforms these can take several forms, some  visible to others and some not. Unsubscribing  from  updates,  using  lists  to  exclude  the   ex-friend, and using privacy settings are com- mon mechanisms to employ.  Lopez  and  Ovaska   2013   divide  these  various strategies into ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ pro- cesses,  according  to  their  visibility  to  oth- ers;  soft  processes  are  relatively  invisible  to other parties, while hard processes target  others directly. Soft processes include unsub- scribing,  using  lists,  and  adjusting  privacy  settings,  while  hard  processes  include  total  disconnection and reporting an individual to  the  platform  provider  and or  blocking  them  from  all  communication.  Networked  indi- viduals  are  more  likely  to  take  soft  actions  as a disengagement process than hard actions   Peña & Brody, 2014 , as these soft processes  remain silent to other users  Malinen, 2015 .  This silence holds distinct, relational preserv- ing advantages, as users can claim plausible  deniability of their action  Lopez & Ovaska,  2013 . For example, because users interface  with  the  social  media  technology,  and  not  each other, ‘the technology’ can absorb some  responsibility  for  any  interactional  failures,  such as not seeing posted content. Likewise,  use of the platform as an intermediary affords    our networked selves  365  users ambiguity, which enables the saving of  face,  and  reduces  the  social  cost  of  discon- necting actions  Aoki & Woodruff, 2005 .  Conversely,  though  formal  notification  does not take place, hard processes may still  be  detected  by  the  disconnected  partner,  by  examining one’s connection lists or attempt- ing  to  communicate  directly.  These  hard  processes embody a more visible and public  character, as they can be witnessed by others   i.e., the lack of connection between individ- uals is visible, just as a connection is visible ,  so  they  result  in  greater  social  consequence  than  softer  actions   Peña  &  Brody,  2014 .  Disconnections  are  viewed  by  the  discon- nected partner as an important, though often  not  unexpected,  negative  outcome  of  rela- tionship de-escalation  Bevan, Ang & Fearns,  2014 . Those who unfollow or unfriend oth- ers  do  not  perceive  a  need  to  communicate  such  information  to  those  who  have  been  disconnected   Malinen,  2015 ,  perhaps  reflecting the mundane nature of disconnec- tion activity. When disconnection is unantici- pated, those who are on the receiving end of  disconnection sometimes contact the initiator  and report moderate to high satisfaction with  the follow-up interaction  Bevan et al., 2014 ;  this  perhaps  indicates  appropriate  relational  closure. Perhaps most importantly, both hard  and soft strategies leave open the possibility  for relational reconnection at a future point.  conclusion: connecTing   The neTWorked self  Social  media  enable,  challenge,  and  recon- figure  relationship  and  connection  in  ways  that  mirror,  and  sometimes  transform,  more  traditional  understandings  of  friendship  and  the  self.  These  technologies  provide  addi- tional  ways  to  relate  to  one  another,  while  simultaneously offering tangibility and digi- tal  traces  of  our  relational  connections.   To  tease  apart  how  these  technologies  have  shaped  interaction,  we  explored  how  three   major stages of relational development – the  establishment of connection; relational man- agement  and  boundary  work;  and  relation- ship  disconnection  –  transpire  and  occur  through their use.  The sense of self sustained through these  modes of connection and expression is reflex- ively adjusted across platforms, publics, and  taste  cultures  to  facilitate  a  narrative  about  the  self.  This  narrative  is  sustained  through  social  environment  that  sustain  always-on,  ambient modalities of sociability. The appeal  of these environments lies in their ability to  reassure our desire for individual autonomy  with  our  need  for  relational  support,  but  comes at a cost. As our ability to sustain con- nections is amplified, our social environment  is  further  saturated  with  the  potential  for  ever-growing social connection. For the self,  this requires balancing a variety of relational  narratives  simultaneously  without  losing  one’s  own  sense  of  self.  It  requires  devel- oping  a  storytelling  of  the  self  that  is  both  coherent and polysemic in nature; meaning- ful  to  the  self  and  relevant  to  distinct  and  overlapping  audiences.  The  management  of  this reflexivity, across spaces publicly private  and  privately  public,  generates  both  tension  and opportunity for the individual. The abil- ity to manage this reflexivity optimally, in a  manner  that  balances  tension  with  opportu- nity, rests upon redactional acumen. In craft- ing the relational self-portrait that establishes  the  basis  of  connection,  people  edit,  adjust,  revise, and reorganize behaviors and ensuing  performances.  As  digital  traces  of  identity  assemble to form impressions of a relational  self-portrait, redaction becomes an essential  form of literacy.  Future research could focus on the follow-  ing potential areas:   	 Storytelling  of  the  self,  and  the  oralities  that  emerge as new modalities of storytelling develop.  	 Literacies  necessary  in  managing  the  relational  contexts  that  online  technologies  frequently   collapse.   	 Emphasis on avenues for maintaining contextual  integrity  Nissenbaum, 2010  as people develop    366   	  and  manage  personal  connections,  social  rela- tions,  and  self-actualization  across  spaces  that  do  not  draw  a  distinction  between  digital  and  non-digital, public and private, online and offline. Imagined  audiences,  aspirational  selves,  and  the networks rendered as people perform aspi- rational  selves  to  imagined  communities  of  audiences.   	 Augmented  reality  and  relational  maintenance   across these contexts.  As  research  in  this  area  moves  forward,  its  emphasis centers on self-presentation, repre- sentation,  and  performance.  The  process   of  self-presentation,  performance  or  self- portraiture   Donath,  2015   involves  both  production  of  performances  and  simultane- ous  or  subsequent  editing  of  these  perfor- mances.  Redaction  enables  the  bringing  together  and  editing  of  identity  traces,  to  form and frame a coherent performance. It is  essential in balancing and maintaining rela- tionships  within  a  social  environment  satu- rated  with  the  potential  for  connection.  Redactional  acumen  enables  individuals  to  present  a  coherent  and  polysemic  perfor- mance of the self that makes sense to multi- ple  publics,  without  compromising  one’s  authentic  sense  of  self.  This  presents  the  modus  operandi  for  the  networked  self  and  ambient, always-on sociability.  Early studies of communication across and  within  networks  emphasized  the  interper- sonal and relational context. While it remains  meaningful to consider the relational dynam- ics of self-expression, it is worth considering  digitally  enabled  performances  of  the  self  as  ways  of  piecing  together  and  maintain- ing  a  digital  self-portrait,  assembled  out  of  relational  references  and  interactions.  We  may understand this form of relational self- portraiture as part of the ongoing story or the  reflexive project of the self  Giddens, 1991 .  The ongoing storytelling project of the self is  not just a performative exercise; it is an exis- tentially  driven  and  ever  evolving  narrative,  a  live  self-portrait  of  who  we  are  and  what  our experiences and relations to others mean,  online and offline.  references  Altman, I., & Taylor, D.

An  early  THX  trailer  included  the  slogan  ‘The  audience  is  listening.’ Today, thanks in part to Zuckerberg  and  other  so-called  Web  2.0  entrepreneurs,  ‘the people formally known as the audience’   Rosen, 2006  are sharing, liking, following,  tweeting,  blogging,  reblogging,  and  other- wise  engaging  with  popular  media  content  produced  by  industry  and  fans  alike.  Of  course,  viewers  and  fans  have  always  done  more  than  passively  consume  media,  but  a  convergence  of  digital  technologies  is  play- ing a key role in bringing about ‘a system of  multiple  producers distributors consumers,  an entirely new configuration of communica- tion  relations  in  which  the  boundaries  between those terms collapse’  Poster, 1995:  3 .  At  its  broadest,  this  chapter  critically  examines  the  ways  in  which  media  content   sharing  sites  such  as YouTube,  peer-to-peer  file  sharing  networks,  and  social  media   platforms  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter   are changing viewing and participatory fan  practices.  In  addition  to  drawing  on  the  small  but  growing body of literature that addresses how  social media is used in relation to viewing and  fandom, I present relevant findings from my  Television 2.0 project  henceforth referred to  as TV 2.0 . While the bulk of television stud- ies scholarship has focused on digital conver- gence and its implications for the television  industry in the post network era  Lotz, 2009 ,  this study was designed to explore the ways  in  which  patterns  of  reception  and  partici- pation  in  fan  culture  are  shifting  as  a  result  of  engagement  with  timeshifting,  streaming  and  downloading  technologies  as  well  as  with social media. Through the collection of  survey  n671  and interview data  n72 ,   TV 2.0 fills a gap between the larger-scale quan- titative  studies,  produced  by  audience  meas- urement  and  marketing  research  companies    television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    373  such  as  Nielsen,  government  agencies  such  as  OfCom   UK   and  independent  organiza- tions such as the Pew Research Center  US ,  and the smaller-scale qualitative studies pro- duced by fan studies scholars.  I  begin  the  chapter  by  interrogating  the  very  notion  of  the  audience,  and  the  dis- tinctions  made  between  audiences  and  fans  as  well  as  between  participatory  and  non- participatory  fans.  I  then  deconstruct  these  binaries, instead placing viewing and online  participatory  practices  on  a  continuum.  Finally, I provide a detailed discussion of the  ways  in  which  platforms  such  as YouTube,  Facebook and Twitter complicate and ‘dirty’  established  fan  practices  associated  with  older internet technologies. Given the focus  of my research, the reception and participa- tion practices discussed below are in relation  to television, although much of the analysis  can be applied to engagement with other gen- res of popular media, such as film and music.  meThod  The TV 2.0 project is a mixed methods study  that  is  best  classified  as  quant-QUAL   Morgan,  referenced  in  Hesse-Biber  and  Leavy,  2011 ;  it  is  primarily  a  qualitative  study  with  a  quantitative  component.  Data  were collected over a two-year period begin- ning  in  September  2010.  Individuals  and  online  communities  with  scholarly,  profes- sional and or personal interests in television  were  invited  via  email,  listservs,  and  social  media   Facebook  and  Twitter   to  take  the  online survey questionnaire and were encour- aged to share information about and the link  to  the  survey.  Purposive  and  snowball  sam- pling were chosen not only to identify a rea- sonably  diverse  population  of  television  viewers and fans, but also to seek out poten- tial  interview  participants.  SPSS  software  was  used  for  statistical  analysis.  Of  the   281  respondents  who  expressed  interest  in  being  interviewed  by  telephone  or  Skype,   110  confirmed  their  interest.  The  first   50 participants were selected in the order in  which  they  responded;  purposive  sampling  was  then  used  after  a  review  of  the  demo- graphic  variables  to  select  the  final  set  of  participants to ensure a diverse sample. The  interviews  were  semi-structured  and  ranged  from 30 minutes to two and a half hours. All  were  transcribed  and  coded  using  QSR  NVivo  software.  Participants  were  asked  to  choose a pseudonym; a few chose to use their  own  first  names,  initials,  or  social  media  ‘handles.’  The  demographic  snapshot  of  the  survey  respondents is as follows: 66.3% were female,  22.3%  were  male  and  1.3%  self-identified  as  non-binary.  The  age  of  the  respondents  ranged  from  18   the  minimum  age  to  take  part in the survey  to 75, with a mean of 34.6:  71% were under the age of 40. Respondents  resided in a total of 33 countries, dominated  by  the  USA   40% ,  Canada   18% ,  and  the  UK  13% . As for the interview participants,  almost  three-quarters  were  female   n53   and two-thirds were under the age of 40. Just  under half resided in the USA, 12 in Canada,  11 in the UK, six in Europe, five in Australia  New Zealand, two in South America  Brazil  and Argentina  and one in India, Israel, and  Malawi respectively.  Theorizing audiences, fans,   and parTicipaTory pracTice  What  I  call  the  reception  turn  of  the  early  1980s  in  mass  communications   US   and  cultural  studies   UK   marked  a  major  para- digm shift, from passive to active audience,  from  mindless  consumer  to  engaged  viewer  and  producer  of  meaning.  With  the  emer- gence of fan studies and new media studies,  the  audience  began  to  be  displaced  as  an  object  of  study  in  favour  of  participatory  culture  and  the  user produser  respectively   Bird,  2011 .  In  his  seminal  work  Textual  Poachers,  Henry  Jenkins   1992   makes  the    374  distinction  between  the  ‘bystander’   a  term  first used by Ellis  1989  to describe the tel- evision  viewer  in  relation  to  the  cinema  viewer   and  the  fan.  He  describes  a  set  of  collective practices, including the production  of art, music, fiction and video, which form  the  basis  of  a  participatory  culture.  At  the  heart of this culture is a desire for connection  and community  Jenkins, 1992 . Drawing on  Toffler’s notion of the prosumer, Axel Bruns  coined  the  term  produsage  to  describe  ‘the  collaborative  and  continuous  building  and  extending  of  existing  content  in  pursuit  of  further  improvement,’  citing  examples  of  open source software development, Wikipedia,   and  multi-user  games   Bruns,  2006:  276.  Later  work  by  Jenkins   2006   on  conver- gence  culture  and  that  of  Bruns   2008   on  video  sharing  and  remix mashup  culture  demonstrate that participatory fans are indeed  some of the most active produsers. ‘Fandom  is  the  future,’  states  Jenkins   2007:  361 .  ‘Certainly  there  are  still  people  who  only  watch the show, but more and more of them  are sneaking a peak at what they are saying  about  the  show  on  Television  without  Pity,  and once you are there, why not post a few  comments. It’s a slippery slope from there.’  fanification   This  so-called    Nikunen,  2007   of  the  audience  has  been  met  with  criticism  for  overestimating  the  numbers  of  fans involved in produsage  see Bird, 2011;  Burgess, 2011 . Yet counter-claims that fans  make  up  a  minority  of  television  audiences  are also unsubstantiated. Van Dijck, for exam- pled, makes reference to the ‘emerging rule  of thumb’ that only one in a hundred view- ers  will  actually  produce  online  fan-based  content   quoted in Bird, 2011: 504 . Jenkins,  Ford  and  Green   2013:  155   have  tried  to  address these concerns, striving not to ‘over- state the prevalence of many active audience  behaviors’. At the same time, they maintain  that  even  those  who  are  ‘just’  viewing  ‘do  so  differently  in  a  world  where  they  recog- nize  their  potential  to  contribute  to  broader   conversations  about  that  content’   2013:   154–155 .  They  cite  findings  from  several   surveys  conducted  by  the  Pew  Research  Center  that  show  that  media  production  among teens is steadily increasing.  What seems to be taken for granted in this  debate is that there is indeed an audience to be  ‘fanified.’ While  numerous  reception  schol- ars have followed the lead of Ien Ang  1991,  1996   to  complicate  or  redefine  the  con- cept  see Abercombie and Longhurst, 1998;  Fiske,  1992;  Gorton,  2009;  Livingstone,  2004 ,  active  audiences  are  as  much  a  con- struct of the imaginings of others as are the  passive  audiences  of  the  Nielsen  Company  or the Frankfurt School. They are what John  Hartley calls invisible fictions:  In no case is the audience ‘real’, or external to its  discursive  construction.  There  is  no  ‘actual’  audi- ence that lies beyond its production as a category,  which is merely to say that audiences are only ever  encountered per se as representations. Furthermore,  they  are  so  rarely  self-represented  that  they  are  almost always absent.  Hartley, 1992: 105, italics in  the original   It is this last point on self-representation that  is  key.  Nation  states  are  described  by  Anderson   1983   as  imagined  communities,  their citizens invested in ‘steady, anonymous,  simultaneous  activity’   Anderson,  cited  in  Hartley,  1992:  104 .  Television  audience  members, on the other hand, are not invested  in their collective existence. John Fiske takes  a similar position to Hartley in declaring that  the  ‘“television  audience”  is  not  a  social   category. … Categories focus our thinking on  similarities:  people  watching  television  are  best modeled according to a multitude of dif- ferences’  Fiske, 1989: 56 . Livingstone and  Das   2013   echo  Ang’s  position  that  the  ‘thingness’  associated  with  the  concept  of  audience  is  misleading. They  argue  that  the  audience is ‘a noun that merely stands in as  shorthand for the verbs that account for the  textually technologically  mediated  commu- nicative  processes  that  connect  people’   Livingstone and Das, 2013: 111 . I am argu- ing,  however,  that  the  audience  cannot  be  decoupled from its history of thingness and  that  its  use  is  overdetermined.  Hence,  the    television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    375  audience is always a mass audience, a fiction  that is always in the process of being made  ‘real’ through its measurement, monetization  and  commodification.  While  this  process  must  be  studied  and  critiqued  in  the  era  of  Big Data  see Andrejevic, 2007 , concept is  best dispensed with altogether and attention  paid  to  what  Fiske   1987:  57   describes  as  ‘the  processes  of  viewing,  that  variety  of  cultural  activities  that  take  place  in  front  of  the  screen,’  and,  today,  in  front  of  multiple  screens  as  well  as  on  the  screen  itself.   The issue of ‘fanification’ raised at the begin- ning  of  this  section  therefore  needs  to  be  examined  in  terms  of  the  relationship  between viewing, participation and fandom.  Following  Jenkins   1992 ,  fan  studies  scholars, including myself  Bury, 2005 , have  focused on participation in relation to com- munity  making.  This  focus,  in  conjunction  with  the  greater  visibility  of  participatory  culture afforded by the internet, has had the  effect  even if not the intention  of not only  rendering  ‘non-participatory’  fans  invisible,  but  measuring  them  against  participatory  fans and finding them lacking. In the TV 2.0  project, I set out to break down this binary by  examining  a  selection  of  established  online  fan practices in the context of a continuum.  On  the  one  end  are  practices  that  involve  lesser amounts of active involvement in fan- dom. These  include  information-seeking,  or  reading posts made on discussion forums but  not posting. In the middle are practices such  as  engaging  in  some  discussion  on  forums  and  possibly  reading  fan  fiction  or  viewing  fan  ‘vids’  without  being  active  members  of  fan  communities.  On  the  other  end  are  interactive interpretive  practices  as  well  as  fan  production  and  creativity  in  the  context  of  community.  To  this  end  I  asked  the  sur- vey respondents to define themselves as fans  based on their engagement with at least one  of  the  following  practices  in  the  12  months  prior to taking the survey:   	 Having  watched  the  majority  of  episodes  of  at   least one season of a particular series.   	 Staying abreast of news about the series through   traditional and new media.   	 Accessing  and or  using  additional  web  content,   such as webisodes, quizzes, or games.   	 Discussing the series with other fans on discus-  sion forums or social networking sites.   	 Producing creative work  e.g., fiction, art, music,  and or  videos   based  on  at  least  one  favourite  series.  Although  I  do  not  consider  viewing  on  its  own to be a participatory fan practice  which  is not to say that viewing cannot be a social  activity , I included it as part of the exclusion  question  to  capture  a  minimal  level  of  fan- nish commitment; those who answered in the  negative were taken to the end of the survey,  skipping the section on fan practices. Perhaps  not  surprisingly,  89%  of  the  respondents  identified as fans, 92% of women and 84% of  men. The response to the first question in the  section  demonstrated  that  those  who  identi- fied  as  fans  were  well  above  the  minimal  one-series threshold, having watched a mean  of seven television series over the 12-month  period.  The  next  question  in  the  section  established  how  often  they  visited  any  type  of online site, including social network sites,  discussion  forums,  and  social  media   platforms, in relation to the series of which  they  were  fans:  12%  answered  never,  22%  occasionally, 26% sometimes, and 41% fre- quently.  When  asked  specifically  about  online  discussion  forums,  37%  reported  having  visited  at  least  one  in  the  past  year,  but less than half  15%  had participated in a  discussion. As for fan creative practices, 25%  had read fan fiction and 13% had written it  and  shared  with  others  online.  The  gap  between  ‘consumption’  and  ‘production’  of  fan vids is even more striking: whereas 31%  had viewed at least one fan vid, only 3% had  produced at least one and shared with others  online  6% were unfamiliar with fan fiction  and vids, respectively .  Taken together, these findings suggest that  both the proponents and the critics of fanifi- cation are correct: the vast majority of view- ers of popular television can be categorized    376  as fans and as such their numbers have been  underestimated.  On  the  other  hand,  most  fans are clustered on the ‘less participatory’  end of the continuum, doing more than just  viewing a favourite program or series, but not  directly engaging in the hallmark practices of  participatory  culture.  The  numbers  of  those  clustered  on  the  ‘most  participatory’  end  have therefore been overestimated. The next  section will explore the ways in which con- tent sharing platforms and social media fur- ther complicate the participatory continuum.  social media and The poWer   of parTicipaTory dirT  Hartley ascribes television’s power as being  ‘located in dirt,’ that is, a form of power that  ‘resides  in  the  interfaces  between  individu- als,  in  ambiguous  boundaries’   Leach,  cited  in Hartley, 1992: 23 . Television is dirty not  only  because  it  has  traditionally  challenged  bourgeois  aesthetics  of  taste   i.e.,  television  as ‘boob tube’  but, in recent years, with the  explosion  of  ‘quality’  television,  it  also  refuses to stay on its side of the low culture  boundary.  I  contend  that  its  power  of  dirt  these days also lies in the refusal of its con- tent to remain on the television screen itself.  Digital  television  is  a  boundary  technology  both  ‘window-on-the-world  and  portal,   flow  and  database’   Bennett,  2008:  163 .  Streaming  and  downloading  technologies  enable  multi-screen  viewing,  that  is,  the  viewing  of  content  on  a  computer,  mobile  device,  or  via  a  set-top  box   e.g.,  Wii  or  Apple  TV ,  connected  to  a  television  set.  They also permit the widespread circulation  of television and other media content by fans  through  a  number  of  platforms,  such  as  Vimeo,  YouTube,  iTunes  and  peer-to-peer  file-sharing networks using BitTorrent clients   e.g.,  Pirate  Bay .  Social  media  platforms  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter  are  similarly  ‘dirty’  because  of  the  ways  in  which  they  alter  established  practices  and  enable  new   ones.  Furthermore,  the  boundary  between  the  television  viewer  and  new  media  user  becomes blurred as it does between the ‘real’  spaces of viewing and cyberspaces. Below, I  discuss  four  such  dirty  practices:  spreada- bility,  second  screen,  liking  and  following,   and creativity.  Spreadability  When undertaken by fans, the sharing of tel- evision content can be understood as a prac- tice  of  spreadability   Jenkins,  Ford,  and  Green  2013 ,  and  its  dirtiness  is  reinforced  by  an  association  with  piracy.  Despite  YouTube’s  early  identification  with  produs- age,  Burgess  and  Green   2009   found  that   the  most  ‘favorited’  and  ‘viewed’  videos  came  from  traditional  media  sources,  most   of which were almost certainly shared with- out  copyright  permission.   Interestingly,  user-created content received the most com- ments.   According  to  the  web  publication  TorrentFreak,  Game  of  Thrones   HBO was  the  most  pirated  TV  show  of  2016  for  the  fifth straight year in a row, followed by The  Walking Dead  AMC  and Westworld  HBO .   Van Der Sar, 2016 . According to Newman,  ‘the  existence  of  files  of  shows  available   for  sharing  is  itself  a  token  of  the  value  of  certain  kinds  of  television’   2012:  466 .  PricewaterhouseCoopers  surveyed  just  over  200  participants  who  admitted  to  pirating  copyrighted  media  content.  Over  80%  said  that they had streamed TV shows for free in  the  past  six  months  and  61%  said  that  they  had downloaded shows for free  Bothun and  Lieberman, 2011 . My findings were similar.  The  TV  2.0  survey  respondents  streamed  television  programming  more  frequently  than they downloaded it: 86% had streamed  television programming from a network site   e.g., HBO.com  and 82% had used a ‘third- party’  site  such  as  Netflix  and  YouTube,  compared to 63% who had downloaded con- tent  Bury and Li, 2015 . The percentages of  frequent  streaming  from  both  network  and    television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    377  third-party sites and downloading were much  closer: just over and just under 30% respec- tively.  To  comply  with  recommendations  made  by  the  Research  Ethics  Board  at  my  university,  however,  I  did  not  distinguish  between  unauthorized  streaming  or  down- loading activity in the questionnaire, and was  careful  not  to  ask  direct  questions  in  the  interviews about the legality of such activity.  Nonetheless,  a  quarter  of  the  interview  par- ticipants  still  made  direct  references  to  streaming  entire  TV  programs  via YouTube   as opposed to trailers or clips  or download- ing them illegally with BitTorrent clients.  Bothun  and  Lieberman   2011   concluded  that price was a driving factor for piracy, as  was the popularity of the practice – the ‘eve- rybody  does  it’  justification.  Jenkins,  Ford  and  Green,  however,  offer  another  perspec- tive: ‘piracy is as much a consequence of the  market failures of media companies to make  content  available  in  a  timely  and  desirable  manner  as  it  is  a  consequence  of  the  moral  failure  of  audience  members’   2013:  16 .  This position is more in line with the TV 2.0  findings. Those participants who admitted or  alluded to doing so gave examples of series  that were not accessible in a timely fashion  on  broadcast  television  in  their  region  of  residence. William, for example, had already  seen the numerous American series he was a  fan of by the time they were broadcast in New  Zealand. The following samples capture the  frustration  for  those  outside  North America  who are fans of American series:  We’ve moved out of our traditional watching live  to actually torrenting it so we are up-to-date with  the US in Top Chef Masters. We couldn’t stand it  anymore.  The  wait  for  it  was  too  long.  ….  [The  same is true of] The Killing and Game of Thrones,  neither  of  them  are  on  New  Zealand  television.  They are not even being pre-advertised as going to  be on New Zealand television!  Khal   Mad Men here in Argentina got lots of news in  the national newspaper and there is no way to see  it other than the internet because no one bought  it and there is not AMC here but there is a pretty  big crowd of fandom. Mad Men is like an extreme  case for me because it was like, I KNEW it aired on   Sundays or on Mondays. Then on Mondays I was  like desperate and I woke up very early and said,  ‘PLEASE, download Mad Men!!’  Lauchita   American  viewers  gave  similar  reasons  for  downloading British shows like Doctor Who,  Torchwood  and  Sherlock  before  they  were  broadcast  on  BBC  America   although  now  these  almost  series  simultaneously :  broadcast   are   I guess the one that I did seek out that they didn’t  show  on  BBC  America  was  Sherlock.  They  didn’t  show  it  for  a  while.  I  did  go  get  that  one  pretty  quickly.  Being  a  fan  of  Steven  Moffat’s  writing  I  figured it would be pretty brilliant and of course, it  was pretty brilliant.  Rene   These responses offer an explanation for the  TorrentFreak  numbers.  Game  of  Thrones  most  likely  had  the  most  downloads  both  because it airs on a speciality network, HBO,  that requires a premium and therefore more  costly cable satellite package in Canada and  the  USA.  Fans  living  in  other  countries  do  not  even  have  the  opportunity  to  view  epi- sodes at the time of original broadcast. Cost  and  timeliness  are  therefore  interconnected  factors that cannot be reduced to a desire to  get something for nothing.  Heresluck  is  an  interesting  case  of  a  ‘cord cutter’ who downloads everything she  watches:  As  soon  as  I  have  the  DVD’s  the  downloads  are  obsolete. They are lower quality; I can’t use them  for  vidding  purposes  very  well.  I  mean,  I  can  but  they are a pain for various reasons. So yeah, they  are obsolete as soon as I get the DVD’s. I do typi- cally  keep  them  until  the  DVD’s  come  out  just  in  case  I  want  to  re-watch  before  I  have  the  DVD’s  available.  Heresluck   While cost is the primary reason for her not  having  a  cable  subscription,  by  purchasing  the series of which she is a fan, she is, in her  own words, an ‘ethical pirate.’  Robert and Peter Parker were both anime  fans  and  mentioned  the  extra  step  of  ‘sub- bing’,  a  practice  which  involves  the  crea- tion  of  English  subtitles  before  an  episode  is  uploaded  to  be  shared  with  other  fans.     378  M discussed the process by which Brazilian  fans  made  Lost  spreadable  for  other  Portuguese-speaking fans:  When  Lost  was  still  on,  this  is  how  it  happened.  You have that link to watch it on streaming, right?  Then the episode would air around this time here  now is 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. Then this group  of fans, they would download the episode after it  was  aired  and  then  they  spent  the  whole  night  subtitling  it.  Translating  and  subtitling  it.  For  me,  for instance. I will wake up the next morning like  7:00 or 8:00 a.m. and the subtitle would already  be  done.  It  was  ready  to  download.  You  could  download it and watch it at home.  M   Taken together, the quotations above demon- strate that while piracy may not be the future  of TV, as De Kosnik  2010  claims, there can  be  no  question  that  it  is  a  global  practice  primarily driven by affective desire.  Second Screen  A laptop, tablet or smart phone that is used to  access social media platforms while simulta- neously  watching  television  programming  has  come  to  be  known  as  a  second  screen.  According  to  the  Nielsen  Company   2012 ,  45% of American viewers watched television  content  while  using  a  tablet  at  least  once  a  day. Almost  70%  reported  doing  so  several  times  a  week.  These  statistics,  however,  do  not  distinguish  between  attentive  or  fannish  viewing   e.g.,  following  a  Twitter  hashtag  related  to  the  program  being  viewed   and  distracted or indifferent viewing  e.g., check- ing  and  posting  status  updates  on  Facebook  with  the  program  serving  as  background .   A survey by the Pew Research Center found  that 52% of Americans had used their smart  phone as a second screen, with 20% reporting  that  they  checked  to  see  what  others  were  saying about the program they were watching  and 19% posting their own comments about  the  program   Smith,  2012 .  These  findings  are supported by Wilson  2016 . The major- ity of her participants used social media ‘as  an  adjunct  to  television  viewing  when  not   fully immersed in a TV show’  Wilson, 2016:  184 .  For  example,  several  families  were  watching  the  same  program  together  but  using social media unrelated to the program  on  their  second  screens.  Others  were  con- necting  with  absent  family  members  who  were  watching  different  programs  or  not  watching TV at all. Thus the large majority of  second-screen  users  are  connected  but  dis- tracted viewers.  In  2010,  faced  with  a  marked  decline  in  live  viewing,  American  networks  began  to  move  beyond  simply  using  Facebook  and  Twitter  accounts  to  promote  their  popular  series  and  entertainment  events,  to  offering  their audiences second-screen or two-screen  experiences  through  three  types  of  ‘attrac- tors’:  third-party  apps,  companion  content  on their websites, and the use of established  social  media  platforms   Castillo,  2013 .  The  first  group  includes  apps  such  as  Get  Glue and Zeebox that let users ‘check in’ to  shows,  get  stickers,  and  interact  with  other  fans.  These  apps  proved  unsuccessful:  Get  Glue was sold, renamed as tvtag and finally  shut  down  in  January  2015;  Zeebox  was  ‘rebranded’  to  focus  on  celebrity  news  in  April 2014  Dreier, 2014 . Companion con- tent is a form of ancillary content provided by  the networks that are designed to sync with  viewing on the primary screen. AMC’s Story  Sync is one example, offering a series of quiz  questions in relation to the scenes on the pri- mary screen in combination with flashbacks  to related scenes from previous episodes and  promotional ties to other series. It debuted in  2012 with the second season of The Walking  Dead and, according to the network’s Senior  VP  Digital  Media,  use  has  grown  steadily   Bishop, 2014 , making it not only successful  enough to use in the current sixth season of the  series, but also to be developed for other pop- ular series, such as Breaking Bad and Better  Call  Saul.  These  interactive  apps  and  ancil- lary content, argue Lee and Andrejevic, ‘play an   important  role  in  reaggregating  audiences  when  programs  air  in  real  time  and  in  gen- erating  “big  data”  alongside  live  and  social    television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    379  entertainment’   2014:  43,  emphasis  mine .  Wilson conducted the only qualitative study  to date on fan engagement with these types  of apps or companion content. She found that  they  have  the  potential  to  enhance  viewing  pleasure, particularly ‘when they are already  part  of  an  existing  social  [viewing]  situa- tion’   Wilson,  2016:  187 .  Likely  because  the TV 2.0 data collection took place in the  early  days  of  companion  content  develop- ment, only Khal mentioned using the ‘check  in’ app Miso, which shut down in September  2014.  Kim  mentioned  entering  an  online  contest during Season 2 of The Walking Dead  to win a walk-on zombie role by entering a  code shown on the screen during the original  broadcast.  Similar  to  Wilson’s  participants,  both  Khal  and  Kim  were  watching  with  their  spouses  and  described  the  use  of  the  app and entering the contest as a fun, social  experience.  The  juggernaut  of  the  second  screen  is  Twitter. As Highfield, Harrington and Bruns   2013  point out, Twitter is made up of two  distinct  but  overlapping  networks:  those  based  on  follower–followee  networks  and  those  based  on  hashtags.  The  practice  of  ‘live tweeting’ a broadcast of a program or  event  using  hashtags  can  be  traced  at  least  as far back as the Obama–Clinton debate in  February 2008  Pure Visibility, 2008 , which  was within months of the first reported use of  the hashtag in July 2007  Kirkpatrick, 2011 .  A study of trending topics in November 2009  indicated that the largest percentage  27%   was related to entertainment  Hargittal and  Litt,  2011 .  Deller   2011   observed  that  more than 50% of the trending topics in the  UK  in  the  evening  were  related  to  televi- sion programs being aired. Page  2012  also  found that the hashtags that appeared most  frequently in her corpus of tweets from June  2010  were  related  to  sports,  politics  and   television  shows.  According  to  Nielsen,   36  million  unique  US  users  tweeted  about  television in 2013  Nielsen Company, 2014 ,  enough to catch the Company’s attention and  form a partnership with Twitter. In October   2013, Nielsen Twitter TV Ratings launched,  which  measures  ‘not  only  “authors”  –  the  number  of  people  tweeting  about  TV  pro- grams – but also the much larger “audience”  of people who actually view those Tweets’   Nielsen Company, 2013 . It now claims to  measure gender and age demographics  how  its algorithm could accurately capture such  information is another story  and publishes  ‘Daily Top Five’ and ‘Weekly Top Ten’ lists  of the most-tweeted telecasts on its Nielsen  Social blog, and well as a report at the end  of each television season. For their part, the  broadcasting  networks  regularly  promote  the  use  of  the  ‘official’  hashtag  for  a  par- ticular  series  or  event.  It  would  seem  that   the reaggregation of the audience has come  full circle.  Highfield,  Harrington  and  Bruns   2013   describe the practice of live tweeting televi- sion series and events with hashtags, official  or  fan-created,  as  engendering  ‘distributed  public conversations’ that ‘come to act as a  kind  of  virtual  loungeroom  …  where  audi- ence members can come together to discuss  and  debate  in  real-time,  their  responses  to  what  they  are  watching’   2013:  317 .  Yet  their findings, from a large data set of tweets  collected  during  the  airing  of  the  2012  edi- tion  of  the  Eurovision  Song  Contest,  do  not  support  this  claim. Although  their  close  analyses of some of the national clusters sug- gests ironic and political content, they did not  attempt  to  distinguish  between  commentary  and conversation.  Drawing  on  Bourdieu’s  notion  of  a  lin- guistic  marketplace,  Page   2012   offers  a  more  nuanced  understanding  of  live  tweet- ing as a participatory practice: ‘Hashtags are  a  crucial  currency  which  enables  visibility  and projects potential interaction with other  members’   2012:  184 .  She  suggests  that  what  appears  to  be  conversational  may  in  fact  be  ‘para-social  simulations  of  conver- sationality  found  in  broadcast  talk’   2012:  184 , in other words, people talking at each  other rather than to each other. Her analysis  of the Twitter data she collected showed that    380  the ‘one-to-many’ update type of tweet was  more  popular  than  the  ‘addressed’  tweet  in  which  the  @  symbol  is  used.  For  example,  the subset of tweets that used leadersdebate   2010 UK election  had 10 times more ‘one  to  many’  tweets  than  @  replies.  That  said,  this does not preclude viewers who live tweet  or  read  the  tweets  using  the  hashtag  from  feeling  that  they  are  part  of  a  larger  inter- pretive  community  or  participatory  culture.  Zappavigna  cited in Page, 2012: 184  refers  to this as ambient affiliation. Similarly, Wohn  and  Na   2011   analyzed  over  1,000  tweets  made  during  an  October  2009  broadcast  of  So You Think You Can Dance. They mapped  tweet patterns onto the content of the show,  noting spikes in emotion, attention and opin- ion messages during commercial breaks, and  when one of the dancers was injured. The rest  of  the  program  was  dominated  by  informa- tional  tweets.  Similar  to  Page   2012 ,  they  found very little interactivity, noting that less  than 4% of the tweets directed at a specific  user using the @ symbol were reciprocated.  By using hashtags and retweeting, however,  they suggest, as Page does, that these viewers  are signaling their interest in being ‘part of a  larger group’  2012: 10 .  Just  over  one-third  of  the TV  2.0  survey  respondents,  and  nearly  two-thirds  of  the  participants interviewed, used Twitter to fol- low fan-related feeds or tweet as a fan. About  one-third  n=14  of the latter engaged in the  practice of live tweeting and or followed tel- evision-related hashtags during a broadcast:  I  know  there  was  quite  a  few  weeks  ago  when  Supernatural  did  their  Super  Uber  Meta  episode,  as they billed it. So there was a ton of live tweeting  of that one because everyone was just so excited  and  wanted  to,  I  don’t  know  –  disseminate  as  much  as  possible  and  as  quickly  as  possible  and  that seemed to be the way to do it. I don’t remem- ber  the  hashtag  they  used  but  it  was  trending  pretty quickly and pretty high.  Rene   If you follow a hashtag on Twitter, like there is, I  mean, I have been part of global ‘oh, come on’s’!!  Where  literally  there  are  people  and  I  have  no   idea  who  they  are.  They  live  in  Montana,  that’s   awesome.  And  we  are  collectively  going,  ‘Tony  DiNozzo  [NCIS]  would  never  do  that!!!’  …  I  am  not sure that I would have a satisfying TV experi- ence if I couldn’t immediately keyboard smash at  people  and  go,  ‘Oh,  God!  How  is  this  going  to  work?!’ Or, ‘That was brilliant!!’ or ‘That was ter- rible!’  Knitmeapony   The above data samples capture the enthusi- asm  and  excitement  of  ambient  affiliation.  Suzie  made  explicit  the  pleasures  of  this  affiliation  in  relation  to  shows  that  she  watched at home alone:  I think there is this urge that we have in all of us to  experience  something  together  and  so  whether  you call somebody on the phone or you go online  with other people. Like my husband and son, they  watch Amazing Race and Survivor but they don’t  watch the Real Housewives and when I watch The  Bachelor  they  say,  ‘what  is  that?’  …  I  think  it’s  really  nice  that  you  can  find  a  community  of  people who care about the show and talk about  the  show  and  they  are  just  at  your  fingertips.   Suzie   Not  everyone,  however,  desires  a  shared  viewing experience. Aimee told me that live  tweeting  held  no  appeal  to  her:  ‘I  would  rather focus on the storyline that’s happening  in  front  of  me.’  Farah  was  not  interested  in  live tweeting because she was not interested  in the opinions or reactions of others: ‘I tend  to just watch it and think what I want to think  about  it.’  Heresluck  was  interested  in  the  responses of others but not their live tweets:  I  mean  I  know  that  there  are  people  who  really  enjoy  things  like  say  live  tweeting  a  show  while  they are watching it and seeing all the tweets that  other  people  are  posting  about  Supernatural  or  whatever.  I  kind  of  don’t  care  about  that  at  all.   I  am  much  more  interested  in  seeing  someone’s  post about it a day or two later when they’ve had  a chance to organize their thoughts and produce  something sort of interesting and in-depth. That’s  my priority.  Heresluck   Live  tweeting  is  also  problematic  for  those  unwilling  or  unable  to  watch  programming  live:  I  frequently  have  to  turn  my  Twitter  off  for   12 hours or 24 hours at a time during Idol season    television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    381  or  Survivor  season  because  there  is  going  to  be  discussion all over Twitter. I am going to be spoiled  if  I  leave  it  on.  And  the  same  obviously,  goes   by  extension  to  various  other  shows  even  non- competitive reality shows, you know. I had to be  very careful while Lost was airing because inevita- bly people want to discuss it and it’s going to be at  least a couple of days before I am able to get the  content and view it.  William   This last set of quotes gestures to the uneven- ness  of  this  practice  and  the  varying  condi- tions  under  which  fans  make  meanings  and  pleasures from televisual texts as well as the  differing  levels  of  investment  in  a  shared  viewing  experience.  There  can  be  no  ques- tion that the second screen functions to blur  the boundary between viewing and participa- tion, whether through the use of a third-party  app,  ancillary  web  content,  or  social  media  platforms.  Liking and Following  Almost half the TV 2.0 respondents reported  having liked a series on Facebook, making it  the  most  popular  practice  included  in  the  survey.  Among  those  interview  participants  who  used  Facebook  and or  Twitter  as  fans,  there were variations in engaging in the prac- tice. Some, like Sophie, liked or followed all  the  shows  that  they  watched,  while  others  were more selective. ‘It depends on the hot- ness of the actor!’ Bunny exclaimed. ‘Usually  just the ones that I really really super like. I  have  to  really  be  into  them  to  try  to  follow  their feeds or anything like that.’  Liking or following also provides informa- tion about a favourite series and its showrun- ners, actors, and so on. Such information has  always  been  important  to  fans.  Fiske   1989   argues  that  secondary  texts,  including  pro- motional  material,  professional  and  amateur  criticism, insider information and ‘biographi- cal gossip’ serve to extend the meanings and  pleasures  of  the  primary  television  texts.  Facebook  and  Twitter’s  customized  news- feeds, however, are ‘push oriented,’ serving to   change  ‘pull-oriented,’  browser-based  infor- mation-seeking  practices  into  information  receiving and aggregation:  I get a lot of my fan news now from Facebook. So  I follow all the shows that I like and a number of fan  sites. So a fair chunk of my Facebook feed is either  first order or second order fannish stuff.  Revan   Twitter and Facebook are nice for immediate infor- mation about the stars themselves and I appreciate  the TV stars.  Mary   [Twitter] is more instantaneous. … I have got news  sites on there but I have also got fandom people  on there and you see a lot of useful links and news  come by.  Vera   There are a couple of news ones that I follow that  have  EVERY  single  thing  that  Adam  Lambert  or  Kris  Allen  [American  Idol]  does.  They  will  have   a link to it or tweet about it. So I follow, like I get  a lot of fandom information that way.  Anne, 164   The appeal of Facebook and Twitter thus lies  in  the  immediacy  and  extensiveness  of  the  information  afforded  by  the  customized  newsfeed.  The  practice  of  liking  and  following  is  more  than  a  way  to  receive  and  aggregate  information;  it  provides  the  possibility  of  receiving news and information directly from  showrunners, actors, and reality stars: ‘Public  figures can now seemingly speak directly to  their  fanbase  without  news  or  management  filters’  Bennett, 2014b: 8 . The research to  date on this more direct relationship has been  conducted primarily from the perspective of  the artist celebrity: Marwick and boyd  2011   did  a  close  analysis  of  20  Twitter-verified  accounts,  including  those  of  well-known  actors and musicians such as Mariah Carey.  Baym   2012,  2015   interviewed  more  than  30  independent  musicians  to  examine  the  complexities  of  their  communications  with  their  fans  through  Twitter.  Bennett   2014a   examined Lady Gaga’s tweets sent to her ‘lit- tle monsters,’ a term of endearment she uses  for her fans.  Several  TV  2.0  participants  spoke  enthu- siastically about following the feeds of one’s  ‘objects’ of affection:   382  If Nathan Fillion is tweeting from the site of Castle  then I am like, ‘ahhh what’s he’s doing and this is  so  cool!’  The  guy  who  played  Rodney  McKay  on  Stargate is also a big Twitterer and he is hilarious.  And Stephen Fry of course. I mean, I am a Jeeves  and Wooster fan all the way up to him being on  Bones. Just HUGE fan of that man. He is massive  on Twitter.  Knitmeapony   I  follow  Brent  Spiner  on  Twitter  and  he  tends  to  post  a  ton  of  things  where  fans  ask  questions  about  what  he  is  doing,  where  he  is,  his  experi- ences  of  playing  Data  [Star  Trek:  The  Next  Generation].  He  is  very  sarcastic  and  very  witty  which is interesting.  Jayne   I follow – oh what’s his name? Sutter, Kurt Sutter.  He’s  the  guy  that  created  and  writes  Sons  of  Anarchy. So he tweets a lot about the show and  what’s happening and where they are up to and so  on with making the show. He also blogs about it.  He follows some of the main players so I find that  really interesting to get these kind of insights into  what’s going on as they produce the show.  Khal   These quotes offer a glimpse into the ways in  which  Twitter  in  particular  serves  to  alter  established mediated producer–fan and actor  celebrity–fan  relations  and  provides  a  new  set of fannish pleasures.  Interactivity: It’s Just a   Tweet Away  With  its  reciprocal  friending  network  and  generous  character  limit,  Facebook  appears  to be more suitable for discussion than Twitter  with  its  non-reciprocal  follower–followee  network  and  its   in famous  140-character  limit.  Yet  few  of  the  TV  2.0  participants,  whether  active  in  fandom  or  not,  reported  using  either  platform  to  engage  in  fannish  discussion  beyond  a  round  or  two  of  turn- taking. Just over 10% of the survey respond- ents  had  posted  a  comment  on  a  Facebook  page dedicated to a series of which they were  fans. Few of the interview participants men- tioned Facebook at all in this context.  Every once in a while on Facebook I will post an  announcement  saying  I’m  really  looking  forward  to tonight’s episode of Dexter and then somebody  will  write  a  comment  to  that.  You  know,  say,    ‘Me too. It’s one of my favourite shows.’ So that’s  one  minor  way  that  I  have  the  social  connection  but  I  have  never  had  a  really  full-on  elaborate  conversation.  LWR   Another reason for the lack of fannish inter- activity  on  Facebook  is  related  to  spoilers   Bennett,  2014b .  Buffy  said  that  when  she  wanted to find out what her friends thought  of  an  episode,  she  would  post  a  comment,  ‘trying to make it as oblique as possible with- out revealing details … and then hoping your  friends will respond in turn.’ One exception,  she recalled was the finale of Lost:  Everyone [was] taking to Facebook with their out- rage  at  how  bad  that  last  episode  was  or  how  disappointed they were in where it went or happy.  … I remember my feed turning into this string of  responses to Lost.  Buffy   On  the  other  hand,  Nem  and  Tarsus  were  members  of  Facebook  groups   X-Files  and  Star  Trek  respectively   set  up  by  fans   as  opposed  to  official  Facebook  sites  for  series  or actors .  Everybody  kind  of  just  gets  to  know  everybody  else.  You  are  kind  of,  there  will  be  times  when  people  will  just  have  little  jokes  with  each  other.  You get to kind of know everybody’s preferences  and you will kind of go, ‘Wow! Denise, look at this  photo.’  It’s  usually  Zachary  Quinto  just  being  FABULOUS! ‘Look at this. Isn’t he wonderful?’ And  she  will  go,  ‘Yes,  isn’t  he  wonderful.’  And  then  everybody will kind of join in. It’s just really know- ing what everybody kind of enjoys and everybody  is going to find funny.  Tarsus   Interactivity,  as  described  above,  clearly  involves  the  kind  of  more  extensive  discus- sion  that  typically  has  taken  place  on  list- servs, Yahoo groups and discussion forums,  and is the basis of community making  Bury,  2005 .  Indeed,  Tarsus  found  out  about  this  Facebook group from her Yahoo group.  Given  Twitter’s  more  restrictive  design  limitations, it is not surprising that a number  of participants referenced its lack of suitabil- ity for interaction:  I  am  not  anti-Twitter  but  I  just  don’t  see  how  it   is,  I  don’t  see  what  it  has  to  offer  in  terms  of     television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    383  communicating  between  people.  I  find  it  a  very  useful information service. But I don’t understand  how people can use it to communicate with each   other.  Diva   The following participants reported interact- ing with others while live tweeting:  We  make  comments  and  so  on  when  we  are  watching  the  show.  It  turns  out  there  are  other  people around [New Zealand] that watch television  the  same  way  we  do.  So  for  instance,  when  Top  Chef comes available or something like that we all  tend to get it around the same time and you can  have a conversation about it as you watch it.  Khal   The  BBC  political  debate  program,  Question  Time…airs  Thursday  nights  at  half  past  ten  and  they have a hashtag … I find lots of my colleagues  in those tweets. So it’s a social thing as well.  Will   Recalling  the  findings  of  Wohn  and  Na   2011  and Page  2012 , which I cited in rela- tion  to  the  second-screen  practices,  it  is  unlikely that these exchanges were extensive.  The few participants who did use Twitter to  interact  with  other  fans  they  knew  and  fol- lowed described the workarounds they used  to have group conversations:  I  actually  do  a  lot  of  my  fangirling  and  stuff  on  Twitter these days. … I have a lot of friends that I  am  into.  Actually  I  talk  a  lot  of  podfic  [fanfic  recorded  as  a  podcast  by  the  author]  on  Twitter.  I  have  mostly  podfic  people  on  my  Twitter.  We  will  get  into  like  just  discussions.  How  you  have  giant  meta discussions all night in 140 characters. It drives  me  nuts  but  I’ve  done  it  more  than  once.  It  gets  really confusing because there are a lot of us.  Anne   We @ at each other and links things to each other:  did you see this? That kind of thing. Part of it is of  being able to have live conversation about things  that  come  out.  New  information  comes  out  and  you are able to talk about it. I GET my information  from  Twitter  and  then  I  am  able  to  retweet  and  point other people to it and talk about it in that  space  rather  than  sort  of  like  going  to  email  or  something like that.  Karen   Honeycutt and Herring  2009  studied the use  of  the  @  sign  as  a  marker  of  addressivity.  Their  sample  indicates  that  most  of  the  exchanges that used the strategy of addressiv- ity  took  place  between  two  people  and    averaged 3–5 messages. The longest exchange  in  their  sample  was  32  messages  between   10  participants,  but  it  was  the  exception. As  such, it serves to illustrate both the ‘level of  interactional complexity’ that Twitter affords  but also its ‘limitations as a tool for conver- sation  and  collaboration’   Honeycutt  and  Herring, 2009: 8 .  The possibility of communicating directly  with showrunners, actors and celebrities was  an exciting prospect for participants such as  Anne, who saw it as ‘the fourth wall … break- ing down.’ Yet, there is little evidence of such  interactivity. Marwick and boyd  2011  note  that Hollywood ‘A-list’ celebrities are either  not on Twitter or, if they are, do not or rarely  engage  with  fans  directly.  Mariah  Carey  never replies to fans publicly but some claim  that  she  has  sent  them  private  direct  mes- sages   Marwick  and  boyd,  2011 .  Bennett’s   2014a  analysis of Lady Gaga’s tweets and  the  survey  responses  from  her  fans  give  no  indication that the star interacts directly with  them. Only one TV 2.0 participant reported  interacting with a well-known celebrity:  Never in my life did I think that I would banter with  George  Michael  on  Twitter  about  politics  which  was what I was doing before you called! Because  he is very involved in this scandal at the moment  and he is just talking his head off and everybody is  talking with him.  Vera   Thus,  it  is  fair  to  say  that  part  of  Twitter’s  appeal is the possibility of realizing the fan- tasy of interacting with the famous. The situ- ation is somewhat different with less famous  artists,  entertainment  workers  and  content  producers.  Bennett   2014b   mentions  that  American  actor  Orlando  Jones  regularly  engages  with  fans.  Baym  interviewed  Zoë  Keating,  an  American  new  classical  musi- cian,  who  said  that  her  fans  expect  her  to  reply  to  their  tweets:  ‘It’s  not  like  “Oh  my  God,  she  actually  wrote  back.”  It’s  like  “of  course you wrote back”’  Baym, 2012: 293 .  Of  the  few  TV  2.0  participants  who  men- tioned tweeting an actor or showrunner, there  was no sense that a reply was expected:   384  Joe  Mantegna  [Criminal  Minds]  said  something  about one of his movies being out and he simply  tweeted, it will be out on such and such a day and  I tweeted back, ‘I have already pre-ordered mine.’  Yeah  that  kind  of  thing.  There  was  something  about supporting veterans and I said, ‘Thank you.  My father’s a veteran.’  Mary   Mary  had  the  following  to  say  to  fans  who  expected replies: ‘Get it over it people … I  don’t  expect  somebody  who  is  starring  in  a  television show to send me a personal reply  to  anything.  That’s  unrealistic.  I  appreciate  what they do.’ Libby did receive replies from  showrunners  Hart  Hanson   Bones   and  Shawn Ryan  Chicago Code  when she asked  whether viewing on TV or online affected the  amount that producers and actors were paid:  ‘I  admit,  it  was  pretty  exciting  when  they  actually wrote back to me. … I got all geeked  about  it  and  I  was  a  little  embarrassed.’  Marwick and boyd  2011  suggest that fans  tweet artists or actors that they follow not to  receive  a  reply  as  much  as  to  display  an  affective relationship.  To conclude, the dirty power of Facebook  and Twitter is located in their potential to col- lapse  the  boundaries  between  information  and  interactivity:  rather  than  visiting  web- sites  for  information  and or  forums  to  read  or discuss, or even going to different sections  on the same site, fans can move seamlessly  from reading their newsfeed, liking or favor- iting fan-related information to commenting   or tweeting. They can also not only get infor- mation  straight  from  the  horse’s  mouth,  so  to  speak,  but  engage  the  horse  directly.   Yet  there  are  architectural  limitations  that  constrain more extended interactions between  and among fans as well as unequal relations  of  power  that  continue  to  constrain  direct  engagement  between  fans  and  the  ‘objects’  of their affection.  Creativity  fanfiction.net,  Organization   the  internet  via  a  combination  of  archives   e.g.,  for  Transformative Works’ Archive of Our Own ,  listservs,  Yahoo  groups  and  Livejournal   Coppa, 2006 . Such production reworks nar- ratives,  characterizations  and  relationships  that  are  protected  by  intellectual  property  laws. As such, the unauthorized use of such  content to create fan fiction and fan vids was  already a dirty practice, as acknowledged by  Jenkins  1992  through his deployment of De  Certeau’s  concept  of  poaching.  In  the  Web  2.0  era,  Jenkins,  Ford  and  Green   2013   argue  that  the  spread  of  content  is  in  itself  integral to its remaking I contend, however,  that fan fiction and vids are a part of a sec- ond-order of spreadability that alters the gift  economy  upon  which  fan  production  and  sharing has been based. According to Booth   2010: 134 , readers of fan fiction and view- ers of fan vids are not expected to reciprocate  in  kind:  ‘what  the  gift  in  the  digital  age  requires for “membership” into the fan com- munity,  is  merely  the  obligation  to  reply.’  This reply could take the form of a positive  comment  or  piece  of  constructive  criticism   Jenkins, Ford, and Green, 2013 .  The operation of what Booth   2010  refers  to  as  digi-gratis,  however,  is  dependent  on  scale and restricted access to members of the  creative  communities.  Second-order  spread- ability is enabled by sites like YouTube. As a  result, ‘fan producers are no more able to con- trol the dissemination of their texts than corpo- rate producers’  Russo, 2009: 127 . According  to  Freda,  an  acafan  who  does  research  on  vidding, there is ‘a tension in the community  [as  to]  whether  vidding  can  exist  outside  of  LiveJournal.’ She admitted to being ‘a bit of a  snob’: ‘A lot of times if I see a vid and I don’t  know  the  vidder  or,  and  this  sounds  really  embarrassing,  or  if  the  vid  is  on YouTube  I  won’t  watch  it.’  In  contrast, Anne  was  com- fortable posting her vids to YouTube, although  she also noted ‘snobbery’ around doing so:-  Fans have been collaborating on and sharing  creative works online since the early days of   There are YouTube communities from what I have  seen  but  there’s  also  sometimes  some  snobbery    television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    385  involved where it’s like if you post a YouTube you  are not as good. Kind of like with fic and archives.  A  lot  of  people,  especially  on  LiveJournal  will  be  like,  ‘Well,  I  don’t  like  going  to  archives.  I  would  never post my fic to archives because archives have  so much bad fic.’  Anne   These  comments  highlight  a  longstanding  concern  about  quality  among  those  I  have  described  elsewhere  as  ‘elite’  fans   Bury,  2005,  2008 .  From  the  expansion  of  the  internet  to  include  the  AOL   America  OnLine   bulletin  boards  in  the  early  1990s,  elite fans have expressed concerned about a  decline  in  standards  of  interpretation  and  creativity  due  to  the  participation  of  ‘the  masses,’ who are seen as lacking the levels of  cultural and linguistic capital needed to pro- duce  or  engage  with  ‘quality’  works.  Platforms like YouTube short-circuit the gift  economy,  the  implicit  value  of  which  is  founded on what Bourdieu  1993  calls bour- geois  aesthetics.  Outside  the  boundaries  of  fan communities, there is no guarantee of a  ‘quality’ reply or feedback.  One positive effect of spreadability on this  scale  is  that  it  affords  the  opportunity  for  ‘view-only’ fans as well as those fans on the  ‘less  participatory’  end  of  the  continuumto  become familiar with fan creativity.  Every  now  and  then  a  friend  of  mine  will  post  something on Facebook, for example, a fan vid but  they  don’t  know  it’s  a  fan  vid.  They  don’t  know  what it is; they don’t know about fandom. It’s like,  ‘I  found  this  cool  video.  It’s  got  House  in  it’  or  whatever  is  going  on  that  day.  At  which  point   I  usually  have  to  educate  them  as  to  what  it  is  they’ve found. Oh, look, you found a fan vid. This  is what a fan vid does.  Rene   Rene also engaged in second-order spreada- bility  by  posting  the  occasional  fan  vid  to  Facebook  ‘if  I  think  it’s  a  really  good  one.’  Gene knew little about participatory fandom  beyond  a  class  he  took  in  cultural  studies.  When he was asked to review a manuscript  submitted  to  a  scholarly  journal  analyzing  fan-made  reedits  using  scenes  of  a  gay  couple  from  Verbotene  Liebe   Forbidden   Love , a German soap with English subtitles,  he went to view them on the YouTube chan- nel where they were posted. When he found  himself on extended bedrest, he went back to  YouTube  and  watched  all  the  original  epi- sodes  of  the  soap  and  actively  searched  for  other fan works not only featuring the couple,  but other queer storylines from international  and American series.  It  was  all  foreign  to  what  I  do  [as  a  communica- tions scholar]. … So it’s been really exciting for me  because it’s the experience of being a fan, which  I’ve  never  been  or  really  understood.  I  mean,  my  earlier  partner  was  a  soap  opera  watcher  and  I  would  leave  the  room.  I  just  couldn’t  stand  the  sound of it.  Gene   Although  Gene  never  became  actively  involved in fandom, and by extension the gift  economy,  the  spread  of  creative  fan  works  beyond  the  boundaries  of  fan  communities  made it possible for him and many other fans  to value and take pleasure in these texts.  Beyond spreadability, there are a few cre- ative practices worth noting that are specific  to  Twitter.  The  first  is  ‘twitfic’,  mentioned  by several TV 2.0 participants. As one might  imagine, it is a very abbreviated work of fic- tion spread over a number of tweets. Anne’s  response pointed to the limitations of Twitter  for such a practice: ‘there is this one fic that   I  am  constantly  directed  to  that  I  like  just  can’t  work  up  the  energy  to  read  because  it’s  in  like  200  Twitter  posts.’  The  other  is  the  form  of  Twitter  role-play  that  involves  the  creation  of  accounts  for  TV  characters  by fans  Bennett, 2014b . Jenkins, Ford and  Green   2013   recount  the  reaction  of AMC  when  Don  Draper  ‘appeared’  on  Twitter,  followed  by  the  other  main  and  supporting  Mad  Men  characters,  including  the  Xerox  machine. After  suspending  the  accounts  as  a  violation  of  copyright,  the  network  even- tually heeded the advice of their marketing  agency  and  relented.  Wood  and  Baughman   2012   studied  the  tweets  from  10  ‘charac- ter’ accounts and their interactions with each  other. They found that much of the tweeting    386  was  live  and  both  supplemented  the  epi- sode narratives as well as provided alterna- tive narratives. Other fans who followed the  character  accounts  would  also  get  involved  in the role-play at times, for example, taking  on  the  role  of  a  minor  character  but  using  their own account. While no TV 2.0 partici- pants engaged in this creative practice, sev- eral mentioned following character accounts   Aimee , and reading character exchanges in  relation to a series  Robert .  conclusion  While communication relations between pro- ducers and consumers have yet to be entirely  reconfigured as envisioned over 20 years ago  by Poster  1995 , Web 2.0 technologies have  dirtied and disturbed the hierarchical binary  relationship. As I have demonstrated, stream- ing and downloading protocols in combina- tion  with  content  sharing  and  social  media  platforms  have  blurred  the  boundaries  between  the  television  screen  and  mobile  screens, viewing and participation, informa- tion and interactivity, and creativity and com- munity.  Much  like  the  printing  press  in  the  fifteenth century, which increased the flow of  communication and raised the likelihood that  more people would have access to copies of  printed materials  Graff, 1991 , content shar- ing and social media platforms spread indus- try-produced content and fan creative works,  increasing  the  opportunities  for  fans  along  the full range of the participatory continuum  to  find,  view  and  engage  with  such  content  through  legal  and  illegal  means  across  national borders. While internet technologies  made participatory culture more visible with  the creation of fan-dedicated listservs, web- sites  and  discussion  forums,  Web  2.0  tech- nologies make ‘less participatory’ fans more  visible by enabling them to like, follow, post,  and  tweet  without  necessarily  becoming  active  in  fandom  or,  pace  Jenkins   2007 ,  even desiring to do so. When I asked the TV   2.0  participants  on  the  ‘less  participatory’  end of the continuum if they could see them- selves becoming involved in online fan com- munities, writing a piece of fanfic, or creating  a  vid,  few  expressed  interest  in  doing  so.   Only those who were media scholars tried to  rationalize  why  they  were  not  actively  involved in fandom.   In  placing  the  practices  discussed  above  in  the  broader  context  of  media  reception  and  technology  use,  it  is  important  to  keep  in mind that most people still predominately  watch broadcast television. According to TV  2.0  survey  results,  only  those  respondents  between the ages of 18 and 29 and those resid- ing  in  continental  Europe  viewed  as  much  programming online as they did on a televi- sion  set   Bury  and  Li,  2015 . As  for  social  media  use,  according  to  the  Pew  Research  Center, while 71% of US adult internet users  are on Facebook, not even one quarter  23%   are on Twitter, less than on Pinterest  28 %   and Instagram  26%   Duggan et al., 2015 .  The use of a second screen in relation to fan- nish engagment is therefore a marginal prac- tice  at  best,  the  majority  of  the  millions  of  tweets during live broadcast sent by a minor- ity of the total viewing audience. Third-party  apps  and  ancillary  content  were  designed  by  the  industry  to  encourage  ‘stickiness’   Jenkins,  Ford  and  Green,  2013   and  shore  up  the  most  traditional  viewing  practice  of   all – live viewing.  Moreover, as the TV 2.0 findings indicate,  fans  continue  to  use  older  platforms  to  find  information, to interact with one another, and  to  share  creative  works.  While  social  media  platforms afford unique pleasures in terms of  information  aggregation  and  the  possibility  of direct communication with writers, show- runners, actors, and reality stars, the same is  not true of interactivity. As I argue elsewhere,  the  in-depth,  regular,  sustained  interaction  enabled  by  older  technologies  ranging  from  listservs to LiveJournal, upon which commu- nity making in fandom was founded, casts the  limitations of Facebook and Twitter into sharp  relief  Bury, 2016 .   television viewing and Fan PraCtiCe in an era oF MultiPle sCreens    387  Finally,  this  chapter  does  not  capture  the  full range of participatory practices involving  the use of social media. The reblogging plat- form Tumblr, for example, is popular among  some fans. Bennett  2014b  notes its use for  visual creativity, a claim supported by the TV  2.0 data. Participant opinions as to its useful- ness for interaction were mixed as they were  for Twitter. There are also several other estab- lished fan practices outside the scope of TV  2.0 project that now have a social media com- ponent:  cosplay   dressing  in  character  cos- tume  at  conventions    see  Lamerichs,  2015   and fan activism  see Bennett, 2014a, 2014b .  I  also  want  to  flag  the  emerging  practice  of  crowdfunding  or  fan-ancing  to  quote  Scott   2015 .  Fan-ancing  relies  on  platforms  such  as Kickstarter to help finance not only inde- pendent creative projects, but those of creators  of commercial film and television but which  lack  full  industry  backing   e.g.,  Veronica  Mars   see Bennett, Chin and Jones, 2015 .  Taken together, content sharing and social  media platforms have not replaced or displaced  older  platforms,  or  transformed  participatory  practices and participatory culture, as much as  they have supplemented and extended them.  references  Abercombie, N. and Longhurst, B.  1998  Audi- ences: A sociological theory of performance  and imagination.

I was  fourteen  years  old,  and  I  had  finally  con- vinced my parents to buy me a rather expen- sive  Pentium  III  desktop  computer  so  that   I could play StarCraft: Brood War with some  friends. The real-time strategy videogame had  just come out, and sparring online with clan- mates from all around Italy was my favorite  activity,  monopolizing  a  large  chunk  of  my  time  out  of  school.  Along  with  StarCraft  came MSN Messenger, gaming forums, IRC  channels,  and  a  variety  of  other  platforms  mediating my online interactions.  Many  of  these  interactions  were  quite  quarrelsome: a regular multiplayer game with  friends or strangers would customarily begin  with  a  ritual  exchange  of  greetings,  then   escalate rapidly into racial offenses or sexual  slurs, often dragged on through private mes- sages until one of the participants blocked the  other  –  losing  a  tournament  game  mattered  quite a lot to us. Similarly, conversations with  classmates,  punctuated  by  rapid-fire  MSN  notification bleeps ringing across my house,  often oscillated between the private plotting  of pranks and more public gossip; the hazing  and  shaming  of  unfortunate  victims  moved  seamlessly from schoolyards to group chats.  Forums  were  even  more  confrontational.   As my interests shifted from online gaming  to death metal, I found myself comfortably at  home in one small bulletin board mostly pop- ulated by people I had never met. Discussions  about the latest album releases would quickly  heat up into violent quarrels about personal  taste,  peppered  by  elaborate  offenses  sin- gling out each other’s mental health, political  beliefs,  sexual  orientation,  physical  appear- ance, and so on.  Over several years of participation, discus- sions in this particular forum became less and    trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  391  less about music, and more a series of con- voluted in-jokes drawing from a shared rep- ertoire  of  ridiculous  stories  that  occurred  on  public  threads,  private  messages,  and  occasional meetups at metal festivals. When  we discovered that it was possible to obtain  embarrassing  personal  details  about  each  other  by  impersonating  this  or  that  person  on the community’s IRC channel, some of us  went beyond the line of what would be today  dealt with in a civil court case. Yet, we found  all  of  this  to  be  worth  the  fun,  and  in  self- reflexive  discussions  about  our  online  com- munity  we  sometimes  marveled  at  how  the  absurdist abuse that we perfected as a form  of sociality had in fact woven a tight texture  of affects and memories between a group of  people living across the country who would  have  never  interacted,  much  less  bonded,  under  different  circumstances.  ‘Il  forum  è  vita’, we often joked ironically when some- one took an abusive session of online hazing  too seriously: ‘The forum is life’.  This  bit  of  autoethnographic  recollec- tion  from  more  than  a  decade  ago,  a  time  when  I  had  no  idea  of  what  trolling  –  let  alone  autoethnography  –  meant,  is  neither  a  disclaimer  nor  an  apology.  Rather,  it’s  an  introduction  to  the  central  argument  of  this  chapter. After  familiarizing  myself  with  the  vast  literature  covering  a  variety  of  ‘prob- lematic’,  ‘disruptive’,  ‘abusive’  and  ‘anti- social’ practices on social media, as well as  with  the  extraordinary  visibility  of  trolling  in contemporary popular media narratives, I  felt  the  need  to  begin  my  discussion  of  the  topic  with  some  first-person  memories.  By  taking  stock  of  the  socially  mediated  eve- ryday  that  Georges  Perec  would  call  ‘infra- ordinary’  1997, p. 177 , I want to highlight  how complicated arrangements of practices,   often reduced to shorthand terms, functional  causes, and direct consequences, are always  grounded  in  individual  and  self-reflexive  experiences  across  time  and  space.  For  the  same reason, I’ve decided to intersperse the  text of this chapter with screenshots of posts  by  users  participating  in  discussions  about  trolling  that  I  purposely  organized  on  two  online  image  boards.  By  including  a  selec- tion of posts collected from two structurally  similar  online  platforms  –  4chan  and  AC  anonymous  board,  respectively  enlivened  by  predominantly  American  and  Chinese   usebases1 – I hope to undermine and desta- bilize my own academic writing, while wel- coming social media users voicing personal  interpretations of their own practices into the  text  Figure 21.1 .  quesTions of  bad  form  Trolling,  along  with  a  shifting  constellation  of  related  or  overlapping  terms   flaming,  spamming,  cyber-bullying,  online  harass- ment,  social  media  abuse,  and  so  forth ,  belongs to the wider domain of social media  practices  that  resulted  from  the  populariza- tion of Internet access and participatory digi- tal media platforms. As Lee Rainie and Barry  Wellman   2012   point  out,  the  intense  socially networked activities of digital media  users, which include countless ways of creat- ing, sharing, ranking and discussing content,  inevitably imply a certain degree of personal  disclosure,  and  easily  lead  to  occasions  for  surveillance and sousveillance:  many internet users are leaving considerable digi- tal  footprints,  advertently  and  inadvertently,  for  others to follow. And follow they do. […] Not only   figure 21.1  anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on 4chan   392  are  other  users  ‘creeping’  and  ‘stalking’  each  other,  but  also  governments  and  large  organiza- tions  have  the  capacity  to  surveil  individuals.   Rainie & Wellman, 2012, p. 80   Hurling  insults  across  private  messages  in  multiplayer games, embarrassing classmates  in  group  chats,  or  impersonating  users  on  IRC channels exemplify the tightening imbri- cation of social media and personal life. The  rapid  pace  with  which  digital  media  plat- forms  introduce  new  affordances  for  inter- personal  this  sociotechnical context, and along with evolv- ing interactional norms and situational rules  of etiquette emerge new ways of disturbing,  harassing or abusing each other online.  interaction  complicates   In  English-language  media,  trolling  has  become a placeholder for a stunning variety  of practices  Hardaker, 2010, p. 224 , ranging  from mocking or taunting each other for fun   O’Neil, 2015  to disrupting large online com- munities   Pao,  2015 ,  and  from  engaging  in  large-scale  harassment  campaigns   Allaway,  2014   to  impersonating  multiple  identities  engaging  in  extremist  activities   Zavadski,  2015 . Andrew Whelan  2013, p. 41  argues  that  the  term  ‘troll’,  both  as  a  noun  and  a  verb,  is  widely  appropriated  by  news  media  and recurrently used to sustain various moral  panics  about  the  abuse  of  networked  com- munications.  The  incorporation  of  this  term  in the inventory of popular media narratives  has resulted in overly simplified explanations  of wildly different problematic social media  practices. On the other side of the explanatory  spectrum are the painstaking attempts of aca- demic researchers to find a solid definition for  these practices, often to counter the populist  sensationalism of media panics  Jane, 2014,  p. 532 . Some examples testify to the variety  of possible approaches to the topic:  Trolling is a game about identity deception, albeit  one that is played without the consent of most of  the players. The troll attempts to pass as a legiti- mate  participant,  sharing  the  group’s  common  interests and concerns; the newsgroup members,  if  they  are  cognizant  of  trolls  and  other  identity  deceptions, attempt to both distinguish real from  trolling postings and, upon judging a poster to be   a troll, make the offending poster leave the group.   Donath, 1999, p. 43   To troll is to have negative intents, to wish harm or  at  least  discomfort  upon  one’s  audience.  To  be  trolled is to be made a victim, to be caught along  in the undertow and be the butt of someone else’s  joke.  Bergstrom, 2011   Internet  trolls  –  a  class  of  geeks  whose  raison  d’être  is  to  engage  in  acts  of  merciless  mockery  flaming or morally dicey pranking. These acts are  often delivered in the most spectacular and often  in  the  most  ethically  offensive  terms  possible.   Coleman, 2012, p. 101, emphasis added   Trolls  are  people  who  act  like  trolls,  and  talk  like  trolls, and troll like trolls because they’ve chosen to  adopt that identity.  Phillips, 2013, p. 505   Online trolling is a specific example of deviant and  antisocial online behavior in which the deviant user  acts provocatively and outside of normative expec- tations  within  a  particular  community;  trolls  seek  to  elicit  responses  from  the  community  and  act  repeatedly and intentionally to cause disruption or  trigger  conflict  among  community  members.   Fichman & Sanfilippo, 2015, p. 163   This chapter is an attempt to pull together the  three contexts sketched above: the multitude of  practices  experienced  in  one’s  infra-ordinary  use  of  social  media;  the  sensationalist  narra- tives  mustered  under  buzzwords  throughout  news media narratives; and the scholarly repre- sentation  of  a  variety  of  practices  often  described as deceiving, confrontational, offen- sive,  negative,  disruptive,  abusive,  unethical,  non-normative, deviant or antisocial. A reader  might  be  expected  to  ask:  What  is  trolling?  Why do some social media users troll others?  Is  trolling  good  or  bad?  How  can  trolling  be  stopped? Unfortunately, my contribution is not  meant to answer any of these questions. As I  summarize in the first half of this chapter, more  than twenty years of research into problematic  social  media  practices  have  already  tackled  many of these interrogatives, providing a wide  variety of comprehensive answers, and produc- ing a rich and detailed cartography of the pos- sibilities of academic approaches to trolling.  The  broader  theoretical  question  that  this  chapter  addresses  is,  rather:  Where  next?  How can we write about trolling, and about    trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  393  other  problematic  social  media  practices,  while  avoiding  both  the  oversimplification  of popular media narratives and the overde- termination that results from academic treat- ments?  I  attempt  to  answer  these  questions  in the second half of the chapter, in which I  present the results of a research project about  trolling on Chinese social media platforms. I  use this example to argue for the advantages  that ethnographic accounts of infra-ordinary  social  media  use,  underpinned  by  a  radical  notion of underdetermination, might have for  future discussions of problematic practices.  going meTa: revieWing  liTeraTure revieWs  Much of the attention that social uses of the com- puter  has  been  given  focused  on  outstanding  incidents of sexual harassment, gender-switching,  electronic  cads  who  break  women’s  hearts,  flam- ing  and  other  abuses,  rather  than  the  countless  rewarding  and  routine  non-problematic  interac- tions  Baym, 1994, p. 29 .  One  of  the  quirkiest  claims  found  in  jour- nal  articles  and  book  chapters  dealing  with  trolling  is  that  there  hasn’t  been  enough  research on the topic  Leaver, 2013, p. 217 .  This lamented underrepresentation is usually  explained with the scattering of existing lit- erature across disciplinary domains  Buckels,   Trapnell,  &  Paulhus,  2014,  p.  97 ,  the  con- flation  of  radically  different  problematic  practices under the same buzzword  Whelan,  2013,  p.  48 ,  the  excessive  technicality  of  research  McCosker, 2014, p. 204 , or insuf- ficient  attention  given  to  trolling  in  a  par- ticular  discipline   Hardaker,  2015,  p.  201 .  Dispersed  across  discursive  communities  or  overlooked  in  specialist  circles,  trolling  is  described  as  an  irremediably  mysterious  activity,  an  esoteric  ritual  practiced  by  folk  devils  in  perpetual  need  of  reconsideration  and of innovative research approaches.  It isn’t a coincidence that most treatments  of trolling begin with a substantial literature  review  of  the  topic.  Literature  reviews  of  trolling research are fairly homogeneous, and  largely agree in tracing the evolution of the  problematic social media practices over two  decades of sociotechnical change:  In  scholarly  work,  trolling  has  morphed  from  a  description  of  newsgroup  and  discussion  board  commentators  who  appeared  genuine  but  were  actually  just  provocateurs,  through  to  contempo- rary  analyses  which  focus  on  the  anonymity,  memes and abusive comments most clearly repre- sented by users of the iconic online image board  4chan,  and,  at  times,  the  related  Anonymous  political movement.  Leaver, 2013, p. 216   Even when slanted towards specific theoreti- cal  resources  or  disciplinary  approaches,  many  reviews  of  existing  scholarship  pro- pose  a  similar  history  of  trolling  research,   figure 21.2  anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on 4chan   394  dividing  it  into  two  major  blocks:  early  explorations  of  conflict  and  impoliteness  in  computer-mediated  communication  and  online communities, and more recent studies  of  problematic  practices  on  contemporary  social media platforms.  In this chapter I provide a more genealogi- cal outlook on this body of research, arguing  that  trolling  and  similar  social  media  prac- tices  have,  in  fact,  been  extensively  studied  across  disciplines  over  a  substantial  period  of  time.  The  purpose  of  my  genealogical  approach,  inspired  by  Foucault’s  lifelong  work on the idea of genealogy, is to ‘account  for  the  constitution  of  knowledges,  dis- courses, domains of objects, etc.’  Foucault,  1980,  p.  117   rather  than  flattening  them  onto a transcendental history. A genealogy of  trolling research seeks to identify the emer- gence  of  the  definitions  of  certain  practices   Rabinow, 2003, p. 55  and has the advantage  of foregrounding how their problematization  is structured and stabilized  Koopman, 2011,  p. 539 . In light of this, rather than pursuing  strictly  temporal  or  disciplinary  categoriza- tions,  I  map  the  existing  research  literature  along three axes of controversies: the tension  between  descriptions  of  trolling  as  part  and  parcel of early Internet culture and its diagno- ses as deviant online behavior  Culture    Deviance ;  the  attempts  at  defining  trolling  versus the pursuit of contextual descriptions   Definition     Contextualization ;  and  the  debates  between  sympathetic  appraisals  of  trolling versus critical condemnations of the  practice  Endorsement   Critique . These   axes  define  a  three-dimensional  domain  of  inquiry along functional, epistemological and  ethical continuums, outline a comprehensive  cartography of two decades of research into  problematic  practices  on  social  media,  and  should provide a clear picture of the zones of  opportunity for future inquiry.  Culture   Deviance  Actually, tell you what scares the shit out of me on  the  net.  AFU   alt.folklore.urban .  Now  there’s  a  newsgroup  to  dread.  Posting  as  a  newbie  there  should be one of those  often fatal  moves grouped  under  the  same  heading  as  accidentally  shooting  yourself  through  the  private  parts.   Anonymous  Usenet user quoted in Tepper, 1997, p. 43   The  first  axis  of  controversy  outlines  a   functional tension between two possible rep- ertoires  of  answers  to  the  question  ‘what  is  trolling?’  –  one  relying  on  insider  accounts  of the practice and defining it as an essential  part of a culture of the Internet, and another  observing  its  disruptive  consequences  and  diagnosing  it  as  a  clear  case  of  deviant  behavior  encouraged  by  computer-mediated  interaction.  A certain impenetrable mystique has been  an integral part of early descriptions of troll- ing, which chronicle a time when disruptive  and uncivil practices in MOOs, newsgroups  and  chatrooms  were  often  called  flaming   Baym, 1995  or spamming  Marvin, 1995 .  Perhaps the earliest account of a case of troll- ing, Julian Dibbell’s ‘A Rape in Cyberspace’   figure 21.3  anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on 4chan   trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  395   1993   presciently  outlines  all  the  major  concerns that have echoed through two dec- ades of academic research and public debate  around  problematic  social  media  practices.  ‘They say he raped them that night’, Dibbell  begins,  providing  a  poignant  first-person  account  of  harassment  in  cyberspace.  The  story is made even more uncanny and estrang- ing  by  the  distance  separating  the  contem- porary experience of ubiquitous and mobile  social media from the textual environment of  LambdaMOO, which the author describes as  ‘a  very  large  and  very  busy  rustic  mansion  built  entirely  of  words’   1993,  p.  1 .  The  ‘Bungle Affair’, during which a MOO player  called  Mr.  Bungle  forced  the  in-game  ava- tar of another player to engage in degrading  sexual acts, is pitched by Dibbell as a case of  online  abuse  that  challenges  techno-utopian  visions  of  cyberspace.  He  begs  readers  to  ‘look without illusion upon the present pos- sibilities  for  building,  in  the  on-line  spaces  of this world, societies more decent and free  than those mapped onto dirt and concrete and  capital’  Dibbell, 1993, p. 1 . ethnographic   to  the  political  debates  across  LambdaMOO  in  the  wake  of  the  Bungle  Affair, which resulted in the deliberation of  new  community  rules  and  in  the  emplace- ment of protective functions, is a clear exam- ple  of  how  early  descriptions  of  interaction  in  online  communities  contributed  to  the  wider  construction  of  an  ‘Internet  culture’.  In the classic definition by David Porter, the  culture embodied by the Internet is theorized  as a product of intense online interactions, ‘a  collective adaptation to the high frequency of  anonymous, experimental, and even fleeting  encounters familiar to anyone who has ven- tured into a newsgroup debate’  Porter, 1997,  p. xi , which happens:  Dibbell’s   attention   rippling   not  in  the  interface  between  the  user  and  the  computer, but rather in that between the user and  the collective imagination of the vast virtual audi- ence to whom one submits an endless succession  of  enticing,  exasperating,  evocative  figments  of  one’s being.  Porter, 1997, p. xiii   A  number  of  researchers  identify  flaming,  spamming  and  trolling  as  integral  parts  of  Internet  culture,  conflictual  and  imaginative  interactions  between  users  and  their  imag- ined networked publics  boyd, 2011  requir- ing  constant  adaptation  and  negotiation   Myers,  1987,  p.  264 .  As  Marvin   1995   notes, ‘[t]hese articulated aesthetics serve as  rules for proper behavior, markers of experi- ence  and  belonging,  metaphors  for  poetic  expression  and  resources  for  play  and  chal- lenge  within  the  community’  but  can  at  the  same  time  be  deployed  for  aggressive  and  even  abusive  purposes   Stivale,  1997,   p.  134 ,  resulting  in  a  form  of  ‘personal  verbal violence’ that is ‘widely practiced and  equally  widely  abominated’   Millard,  1997,  p. 145 . Progressively codified as a ludic in- group  activity,  trolling  ‘serves  the  double  purpose  of  enforcing  community  standards  and  of  increasing  community  cohesion  by  providing a game that all those who know the  rules  can  play  against  those  who  do  not’   Tepper, 1997, p. 40 .  It’s  quite  evident  how  early  descriptions  of  flaming,  spamming  and  trolling  as  inte- gral  components  of  an  emerging  Internet  culture  are  predominantly  based  on  certain  locales   mostly  the  United  States ,  plat- forms   mostly  Usenet  newsgroups  and  aca- demic  LISTSERVs   and  userbases   mostly  educated,  middle-class  males .  This  is  not  a  coincidence,  for  ‘[i]n  its  early  years,  the  only people using the internet were the ones  developing  it’   Baym,  2010,  p.  17 .  Just  as  Dibbell’s  Mr.  Bungle  is  revealed  to  be  a  communal account operated by residents of  a NYU student hall floor  1993 , confronta- tional interactions in online spaces appear to  have been pioneered by the very same ‘highly  educated scholars and researchers’  H. Wang  & Hong, 1996  who were writing extensively  about the topic. In the earliest evaluations of  the  practice,  flaming  is  in  fact  identified  as  an  essential  element  of  academic  mailing  lists: ‘it educates the ignorant, polices cyber- space, brings order to the group, and scares  away  unwanted  commercial  advertising’     396   H.  Wang  &  Hong,  1996 .  University  stu- dents and researchers were the first Internet  trolls,  and  explained  their  practice  by  link- ing  it  to  the  ‘high  concentration  of  reflex- ive,  reflective,  anxious,  and or  contentious  personalities  in  academic  communities’   Millard, 1997, p. 147 .  On the opposite side of these self-reflexive   observations  about  Internet  culture  made   by early adopters of the medium are studies  that  correlate  trolling  and  similar  practices  with  psychological  deviance  or  antisocial  behavior   Fichman  &  Sanfilippo,  2015 ,   a  quite  common  response  to  emerging   phenomena involving new technologies and  youth   Yar,  2005,  p.  387 .  Often  grounded  on  technologically  determinist  arguments  about  the  reduced  social  cues  character- izing  interactions  mediated  by  the  mostly  textual interfaces of the early Web  Kiesler,   Siegel, & McGuire, 1984 , these treatments  of  trolling  correlate  disruptive,  deceptive   and  abusive  practices  to  psychological   features  such  as  sadism   Buckels  et  al.,  2014 ,  identify  the  behavior  of  victims  of  online  harassment  as  coping  strategies    Lee,  2005 ,  and  propose  the  introduc- tion of protective systems and participatory   incentives  problematic   behavior on social media platforms  Bishop,  2012 .  discourage   to   Parallel inquiries in communication stud- ies  and  sociology  take  a  less  prescriptive  position,  and  approach  trolling  as  a  case   study in interpersonal relationships, evaluat- ing the emotional impact of ‘messages that  hurt’  Vangelisti & Crumley, 1998, p. 173 .  The resources most often underpinning this  strand  of  scholarship  are  the  online  disin- hibition  effect  and  deindividuation  theory.  According  to  John  Suler,  a  consequence  of  the anonymity, invisibility and asynchronic- ity characterizing online interactions is that  ‘some  people  self-disclose  or  act  out  more  frequently  or  intensely  than  they  would  in  person’  2004, p. 321 , a form of online dis- inhibition which can in turn lead to dispro- portionately toxic behavior such as trolling.  Following  a  similar  technologically  deter- minist  argument,  deindividuation  theory  correlates  the  anonymity  and  invisibility  characterizing online interactions with anti- normative  behavior,  positing  that  ‘[b]eing  unidentified and thereby unaccountable has  the  psychological  consequence  of  reduc- ing inner restraints and increasing behavior  that is usually inhibited’  Postmes & Spears,  1998,  p.  239 .  Anonymity,  in  the  various  degrees  allowed  by  different  social  media  platforms   Anonymous,  1998,  p.  382 ,  emerges as a key variable in discussions of  problematic online practices  Tomita, 2005,  p. 186 , most recently and notably rehashed  by the popularity of Anonymous, the collec- tive  movement  supposedly  emerging  from  the contentious and anti-normative environ- ment  of  the  4chan  image  board   Bernstein  et al., 2011, p. 53 .  figure 21.4  anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on 4chan   trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  397  Definition   Contextualization  troll v.,n.  To  utter  a  posting  on  Usenet  designed  to  attract  predictable  responses  or  flames.  Derives  from  the  phrase  “trolling  for  newbies”  which  in  turn comes from mainstream “trolling”;, a style of  fishing in which one trails bait through a likely spot  hoping  for  a  bite.  The  well-constructed  troll  is  a  post  that  induces  lots  of  newbies  and  flamers  to  make  themselves  look  even  more  clueless  than  they  already  do,  while  subtly  conveying  to  the  more  savvy  and  experienced  that  it  is  in  fact  a  deliberate troll. If you don’t fall for the joke, you  get to be in on it.  Andrew , 1996   The research literature mapped along the first  axis  of  controversy  in  the  previous  section  was  chiefly  concerned  with  the  functional  implications of trolling. Defining the practice  itself  –  either  as  an  essential  component  of  early Internet culture or as a consequence of  the  technological  constraints  imposed  by  computer-mediated communication – appears  to be a rather straightforward task. The defini- tions of terms like trolling, flaming, or spam- ming are directly lifted from the communities  in which they are used  such as the explana- tion  from  The  Troller’s  FAQ  quoted  above ,  interpreted by scholars who are at times part  of  these  very  same  communities,  and  theo- rized either as activities contributing to online  sociality, or as symptoms signaling the medi- ated  occurrence  of  antisocial  deviance.  The  second axis of controversy, introduced in this  section, complicates the first, functional one  by asking an epistemological question: should  researchers  strive  to  abstract  trolling  into  a  minimal,  generalized  definition,  or  should  they  rather  pursue  situated  and  contextual  descriptions  of  problematic  social  media  practices?  With the popularization of Internet access,  the  multiplication  of  online  platforms,  the  advent  of  social  media  and  the  broadening  spectrum  of  possible  forms  of  networked  participation,  trolling  becomes  a  problematic  question  in  itself.  As  noted  by  Claire  Hardaker,  ‘particularly  within media and social networking circles,   the  definition  of   it is possible to find widely divergent deno- tations  and  usages  that  make  the  creation  of  any  clear  definition  [of  trolling]  almost  impossible’   2015,  p.  202 .  The  dispersion  of  trolling  across  online  communities,  plat- form  userbases  and  networked  publics  has  resulted  in  two  diametrically  opposed  epis- temological approaches to this sort of social  media practice: on the one hand, the effort to  find a minimal definition of trolling that can  be  applied  across  disciplines  and  contexts;  on the other hand, the choice to embrace dif- ferences  and  to  focus  instead  on  pragmatic  explorations  of  what  happens  in  particular  socially mediated contexts.  The definitional effort is best represented by  the work by O’Sullivan and Flanagin  2003   on  what  they  call  ‘problematic  messages’.  In their paper, the authors lament the lack of  ‘precise  conceptual  and  operational  defini- tions of “flaming”’  O’Sullivan & Flanagin,  2003, p. 69 , which leaves the discussion of  problematic practices to popular opinion and  news media, resulting in anxieties and moral  panics  about  the  Internet.  O’Sullivan  and  Flanagin  clearly  write  in  reaction  to  exist- ing academic literature, which they deem too  technologically  deterministic  in  its  general- izing  about  different  social  media  practices  and  defining  them  as  antisocial,  offensive,  hostile  or  aggressive   2003,  p.  72 .  Their  solution comes from social semiotics: while  recognizing that apparently hostile messages  can be motivated by both antisocial attitudes  and pro-social functions, the authors propose  to ground their definition of a practice onto  the context in which it occurs, supported by  ethnographic  attention  to  how  users  articu- late  local  norms.  O’Sullivan  and  Flanagin’s  definition of flaming – ‘intentional  whether  successful  or  unsuccessful   negative  viola- tions  of   negotiated,  evolving,  and  situated   interactional  norms’   2003,  p.  84   –  is  by  necessity  minimal  and  open-ended,  leaving  room for changes of the practice in time and  place, and for its adaptation to the analysis of  other problematic social media practices such    398  as online harassment, hate speech, and so on   2003, p. 88 .  Claire Hardaker’s extended research work  on impoliteness in computer-mediated com- munication  develops  along  similar  vectors.  By  moving  beyond  deindividuation  theory,  she  seeks  to  complicate  the  definition  of  impoliteness  in  online  interactions  through  a  careful  mapping  of  its  different  nuances  grounded on sociolinguistic evidence: ‘a defi- nition of trolling should be informed first and  foremost  by  users  discussions’   Hardaker,  2010,  p.  215 .  Drawing  on  painstaking  lin- guistic  analyses  of  longitudinal  activity  in  two  Usenet  newsgroups   rec.equestrian  and  uk.sport.football ,  Hardaker  proposes  her  own  definition  of  trolling:  ‘Trolling  is  the  deliberate   perceived   use  of  impoliteness  aggression, deception and or manipulation in  CMC  to  create  a  context  conducive  to  trig- gering or antagonising conflict, typically for  amusement’s sake’  2013, p. 79 . After hon- ing in on this definition, Hardaker acknowl- edges that for many newsgroup members the  identification  of  the  practice  is  a  similarly  processual  task:  accusations  of  trolling  are  ‘often  co-constructed,  sometimes  through  heated  arguments  spanning  many  days,  involving dozens of users, and situated within  a set of fluctuating, community-based norms’   2015, p. 205 .  Approaches from the opposite end of the  epistemological  spectrum  avoid  the  defini- tional  problem  altogether  and  begin  from  the situated contexts of different online com- munities  and  social  media  platforms.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  trolling  has  diversi- fied  beyond  the  well-documented  acts  of  provocation  and  deception  on  mailing  lists  and  newsgroups,  and  a  wide  variety  of  recent  research  has  explored  how  problem- atic  practices  emerge  and  are  dealt  with  on  different  online  platforms   Fuller,  McCrea,  & Wilson,  2013,  p.  4 .  In  its  most  extreme  formulation, this contextual approach argues  that  in  the  fluid  ecologies  of  contemporary  media, searching for a general definition of  trolling might be a nearly futile exercise. In   his  study  of  provocative  humor  shared  on  Facebook  groups  by  Australian  spectators  of the 2012 London Olympic Games, Tama  Leaver  demands  such  a  kind  of  epistemo- logical  contextualization  as  a  prerequisite  for any discussion of the topic: ‘if trolling is  situated  as  a  practice  to  be  addressed,  then  the term at least needs to be better explicated  in each instance in order to ensure arguments  and discussions of trolling are actually talk- ing about the same thing’  2013, p. 221 .  Grounding  comparative  descriptions  of  problematic  social  media  practices  onto  the  situated  circumstances  of  use  and  their  representation  in  popular  media  and  aca- demic discourses is necessary to understand  what  trolling  is,  and  isn’t,  across  different   contexts.  Moreover,  trolling  and  similar  terms are undeniably sites of prescription in  themselves – similarly to the recurring anxi- eties around hacking or cybercrime, they can  be ‘actively constructed by governments, law  enforcement, the computer security industry,  businesses,  and  media’   Yar,  2005,  p.  390 .   A classic example of the contextual approach  to  problematic  social  media  practices  is  the  work of Susan Herring and colleagues  2002   on a specific instance of trolling that caused  trouble among the members of a feminist dis- cussion board. Drawing on a detailed descrip- tion  of  abusive  interactions,  the  authors  suggest  a  number  of  possible  contextual  interventions,  such  as  the  implementation  of  filtering  functions  and  the  improvement  of community policies  Herring et al., 2002,   p. 381, emphasis in original .  Similar studies demonstrate the variety of  situational  contexts  and  the  importance  of  understanding  local  articulations  of  social  media practices. For example, while Phillips   2011  demonstrates that trolling activity on  Facebook  memorial  pages  is  underpinned  by  a  critical  attitude  towards  the  platform’s  implementation of post-mortem profile pages  and  towards  global  media’s  obsession  with  tragedy,  Shachaf  and  Hara   2010   find  the  trolling of entries on the Hebrew Wikipedia  to  be  largely  motivated  by  the  boredom,    trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  399  figure 21.5  anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on 4chan  attention  seeking  and  vengeful  resentment  of  a  handful  of  users  directly  impacting  on  the  community’s  well-being.  Problematic  practices  not  only  differ  across  contexts,  but might play out differently in structurally  similar  online  environments:  Binns   2012   describes the counter-strategies employed by  online magazine editors to stymie trolling in  comment sections and avoid disruption of the  community atmosphere  2012, p. 554 , but a  study by Sindorf  2013  illustrates how simi- lar moderation measures implemented by an  online community newspaper to crack down  on  rude  and  insulting  comments  are  widely  perceived by the userbase as an overreaction  and an attack on the democratic function of  the comment section itself  2013, p. 195 .  Endorsement   Critique  […] an entry in the prestigious Journal of Usenet  Stupidasses  written  by  an  academic  from  the  Department of Fine Malt Beverages at Bungmunch  University.  Vrooman, 2002, p. 61   The two axes of controversies outlined in the  previous sections define a horizontal surface  of inquiry concerned with the functional role  of problematic practices and with the possi- ble  ways  of  knowing  about  these  practices.  Just  like  the  epistemological  axis  compli- cates  the  functional  one  by  questioning  the  researchers’  definitions  of  trolling  as  an  essential  part  of  Internet  culture  or  as  an  abject  manifestation  of  antisocial  behavior,  the third axis proposed in this section com- plicates  the  previous  two  by  introducing  an  ethical  dimension:  if  problematic  social   media practices are found to be socially pro- ductive  for  a  certain  community  of  users,  should  the  sympathetic  researcher  take  a  stance  and  contribute  to  their  defense  from  social  stigma  and  mediated  anxieties?  If  playful  in-group  activities  become  abusive  and cause harm to individuals or communi- ties,  should  the  concerned  scholar  renounce  impartiality and raise her voice to denounce  these  actions?  In  light  of  these  ethical  choices, how can researchers deal with com- munities  that  start  talking  back,  reacting  to  their  representation  in  academic  discourse  and media narratives?  An  earnest  sympathy  for  the  emerg- ing  components  of  quickly  changing  social  media  cultures,  combined  with  contextual  attention to the local norms and functions of  problematic practices, often results in schol- ars  engaging  in  mildly  defensive  endorse- ments  and  ethical  reappraisals  of  trolling.  These  sometimes  hark  back  to  histories  of  confrontational  communication  and  disrup- tive performance in society, such as the long  pedigree of rants and invective in American  culture,  which  served  ‘an  important  social  function in communicating social and politi- cal  perspectives’   Vrooman,  2002,  p.  56 .  Subcultural  repertoires  are  another  impor- tant  point  of  reference  for  reassessments  of  problematic  practices,  and  allow  Coleman   2012  to position trolls within an extended  history of technological mavericks, including  phone phreakers and hackers. For Coleman,  these figures of disruption can be interpreted  as  contemporary  iterations  on  the  mythi- cal  notion  of  the  trickster,  historical  and  fictional  characters  that  recur  across  world    400  cultures  and  are  known  for  their  ‘acts  of  cunning, deceitfulness, lying, cheating, kill- ing and destruction, hell raising, and as their  name  suggests,  trickery’   Coleman,  2012,   p. 115 . This is a provocative genealogy, but  as  Boellstorff   2015   cautions,  attempts  at  generalizing trolling by inscribing it in myth- ical  archetypes  can  become  functionalist  tricks of perspective if they are not informed  by  anthropological  evidence  regarding  the  specific social implications and cultural con- texts of tricksterism in world history and lit- erature  2015, p. 394 .  Also  sympathetic  towards  trolling,  but  more  mindful  of  the  problematic  politics  of  naming,  are  interventions  that  draw  on  first-hand involvement with different social  media platforms and critical participation in  networked  publics.  For  Bergstrom   2011 ,  the  exaltation  of  disruptive  figures  should  not obfuscate the fact that among many net- worked publics, the accusation of trolling is  still  deployed  as  an  exclusionary  category  in itself, used ‘as a justification for punish- ing  those  who  transgress   or  are  accused  of  transgressing   an  online  community’s  norms’.  Similarly,  Sindorf   2013   warns  that the very act of establishing the bounda- ries of trolling and incivility in increasingly  commercialized online spaces requires pru- dent ethical positioning: ‘who gets to decide  what  is  and  is  not  productive  to  debate?  Are these distinctions that we feel comfort- able  making?  Are  these  distinctions  that  we  want  someone  else  to  make,  especially  when  they  may  have  financial  motives  at  heart?’  Sindorf, 2013, p. 211 . Ultimately,  as McCosker  2014  argues through a study  of  media  events  and  YouTube  publics  in  New Zealand, defining problematic interac- tions on social media platforms as aberrant  or  antisocial  can  elide  their  participatory  potential:  ‘provocation  should  be  under- stood  in  context  and  examined  in  terms  of  the  way  it  can  not  only  problematise,  but  also  productively  intensify,  vitalise  and  sustain  publics  within  social  media  sites’   McCosker, 2014, p. 202 .  Ethical  choices  not  only  determine  researchers’  positioning  in  relation  to  prob- lematic practices, but the guiding metaphors  they employ to describe social media. While  authors  leaning  towards  the  reappraisal  and  endorsement  of  trolling  tend  to  character- ize  online  platforms  as  arenas  for  agonistic  debate and democratic deliberation, scholars  more  concerned  with  the  consequences  of  abusive interactions seek to ensure the exist- ence  of  safe  spaces   Herring  et  al.,  2002   amidst the pervasively expanding hate space  of  the  Internet   Shepherd,  Harvey,  Jordan,  Srauy, & Miltner, 2015 . The gendered nature  of many online spaces and the predominance  of  sexist  and  misogynistic  dimensions  of  abuse has been consistently traced from the  early  days  of  the  medium,  through  hacking   Yar, 2005, p. 394  and gaming communities   Taylor,  2003,  p.  37 ,  to  contemporary  dis- cussion  boards  and  social  media  platforms   Phillips,  2013 .  In  the  case  of  4chan’s   b   board, which Phillips identifies as a hotbed of  trolling locked in a feedback loop of ampli- fication  with  its  own  news  media  coverage,  the difficulty in assessing user demographics  behind  the  screen  of  anonymity  should  not  hinder  a  recognition  of  ‘the  ways  in  which  trolls’  raced,  classed  and  gendered  bodies  undergird  and  provide  context  for  trolling  behaviors’  Phillips, 2013, p. 495 .  The  work  of  Emma  A.  Jane  presents  a  more radical critique of both trolling and of  its appraisal in academic research. According  to  Jane,  the  numerous  problematic  prac- tices  described  by  scholarship  about  hos- tile  communications  on  the  Internet  should  be  understood  under  the  general  header  of  ‘e-bile’, which she identifies as ‘a type of vit- riolic discourse notable for its hostile affect,  explicit language, and stark misogyny’  Jane,  2015, p. 65 . Besides agreeing with the claim  that  ‘iterations  of  hate  speech  have  become  endemic to much online discourse’  Shepherd  et al., 2015, p. 1 , Jane argues that celebratory  and dismissive scholarly accounts of abusive  practices  are  complicit  in  overshadowing  more ethically pressing questions about ‘the    trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  401  real  harms  done  to  real  victims  in  numer- ous  real  ways’   Jane,  2015,  p.  70 .  Jane’s  evocative  claim  describing  how  ‘toxic  and  often  markedly  misogynist  e-bile  no  longer  oozes  only  in  the  darkest  digestive  folds  of  the cybersphere but circulates freely through  the entire body of the Internet’  2014, p. 532   stands  in  stark  contrast  to  the  functionalist  folkloristics of flaming on academic mailing  lists from two decades before.  Both   the  most  apologetic  chronicles  of  trolling  and  its  most  radical  critiques  are  clearly  speaking  to  a  certain  context  –  that  of  contemporary  Anglophone  cultural   politics – and might seem puzzling to social  media  users  from  the  increasingly  diversi- fied non-English language Internet. Yet, they  suggest an important shift. As the editors of  a recent journal issue about the topic argue,  ‘the way that we talk about trolls and troll- ing  as  a  phenomenon  of  post-Internet  cul- ture places us in a broader, longer fight over  the ethos, the history, and the politics of the  digital’  Fuller et al., 2013, p. 2 . Confronted  with increasingly fluid media ecologies and  expanding networked publics, academics are  demanded to take ethical stances regarding  problematic  practices  on  social  media,  and  to  confront  reactions  from  the  communi- ties  that  see  their  practices  scrutinized  and  articulated by knowledge-producing outsid- ers  Figure 21.6 .  There’s no Trolling in china  During my doctoral research I dedicated part  of  my  ethnographic  fieldwork  on  Chinese  social  media  platforms  to  investigate  the   practice  of  trolling  in  a  sociotechnical  con- text  noticeably  distant  from  the  Euro- American,  Anglocentric  media  ecologies  described  by  the  majority  of  the  existing  scholarship on the topic  de Seta, 2013 . The  People’s Republic of China hosts the world’s  largest Internet user population – 649 million  users as of December 2014, 85.8% of which  go online through a mobile device  CNNIC,  2015, pp. 25–28  – and the accelerated devel- opment  of  communication  technologies  in  the country has been kept under close scru- tiny as a key aspect to understand the grow- ing  prominence  of  the  PRC  in  a  global  context   Zhou,  2006 .  The  history  of  the  Internet in China has been extensively chron- icled over two decades of academic research  both  nationally  and  internationally   Qiu  &  Bu, 2013 , with the majority of the literature  focusing on the implications of the technol- ogy for online business, global Internet gov- ernance and local civil society  Herold & de  Seta, 2015 .  In terms of online platforms, the Chinese  landscape  is  markedly  shaped  by  the  tight  grip  that  the  national  authorities  hold  on  Internet  governance  through  incentives  to  the local industry, protectionist policies and  outright censorship. Even though the impact  of filtering systems and restrictive measures  on user behavior is disputed  Taneja & Wu,  2014 , it is undeniable that the situated pre- dilections  of  hundreds  of  millions  of  local  users result in a distinctly national Internet  experience.  Whereas  contemporary  nar- ratives  of  the  global  Internet  imagine  the  average user networking on Facebook, blog- ging on Twitter and Instagram, searching on  Google or Yahoo!, chatting on Whatsapp or  Snapchat, and watching videos on YouTube   figure 21.6  anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on 4chan   402  or Netflix, the majority of Chinese Internet  users  widely  embrace  homegrown  services  and  platforms  such  as  instant  messaging  software  QQ,  mobile  social  contact  app  WeChat, social networking websites QZone  and Douban, microblogging platforms Sina  Weibo  and  Tencent  Weibo,  search  engine  Baidu, video hosting service Youku Tudou,  and so on. E-mail is rarely used, instant mes- saging  plays  an  important  role  in  everyday  life, and online forums  locally called BBS,  the acronym for bulletin board system  have  remained  popular  since  the  early  years  of  the medium  Wallis, 2011, p. 412 , ranging  from  small  communities  to  massive  com- mercial  or  governmental  platforms  such  as  Baidu Tieba and Qiangguo Luntan  Damm,  2007, p. 413 .  Besides the predominance of homegrown  platforms and services, one of the most evi- dent differences that I noticed at the begin- ning of my investigation was the absence of  trolling  in  local  media  narratives.  Whereas  English-language  popular  media  routinely  describe  trolling  in  terms  of  pranking,  confrontation,  harassment  and  abuse,  in  China  mass-mediated  anxieties  related  to  the  Internet  tend  to  focus  around  a  differ- ent set of practices and phenomena. During  the  time  of  my  fieldwork   2013–2014 ,  the  most  recurrent  Internet-related  anxieties  were  renrou  sousuo  [literally  ‘human-pow- ered  search’],  a  form  of  online  vigilantism  through  doxing   F.-Y.  Wang  et  al.,  2010 ;  the  exploits  of  the  wumao  dang  [fifty-cent  party]  of  government-paid  posters   Chen,  Wu, Srinivasan, & Zhang, 2011 ; the activi- ties  of  shuijun  [literally  ‘water  armies’]  of   commercial  astroturfers   Luo,  2010 ;  and  the  propaganda  department’s  push  against  loosely  defined  yuyan  baoli  [verbal  vio- lence] and wangluo yaoyan [Internet rumors]   Zhao,  2013 . While  these  phenomena  par- tially overlap with the problematic practices  described in the first half of this chapter, the  feelings  and  reactions  articulated  by  local  Internet  users  challenge  simplistic  equiva- lences  with  trolling.  For  example,  recent  surveys  reveal  the  Chinese  Internet  users’  widespread  fear  of  becoming  target  of  a  renrou sousuo  Wallis, 2011, p. 421 , while  discussions with Chinese urban youth high- light  anxieties  about  the  potential  dangers  of  emotional  involvement  with  contentious  online spaces, Internet rumors and personal  attacks  Cockain, 2015, p. 59 .  When I asked users of Sina Weibo, Douban,  QQ and Baidu Tieba about trolling, I found  myself in the awkward position of having to  explain the meaning of the English language  term through actual examples of problematic  online  interactions  –  often  producing  more  confusion than clarity – which interviewees  would interpret using a wide range of Chinese  terms:  ‘this  guy  is  just  a  penzi!  [sprayer]’,  ‘he is zhao chou [looking for trouble]’, ‘this  post  is  diaoyu  [fishing]’,  or  ‘this  one  is  a  naocan  [braindamaged]’   de  Seta,  2013,   p. 308 . While I regularly observed recurring  instances of trolling across discussion boards  and  social  media  comment  sections,  these  practices  were  never  lumped  under  a  single  Chinese word that would directly translate to  ‘trolling’, but were rather described through  a range of specialized vernacular terms with  well-documented popular etymologies  2013,   figure 21.7  thread about trolling i opened on the ac anonymous board  ‘aren’t you just trolling us with this thread?’ anonymous reply to a discussion    trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  403  p. 310 . As kindly explained to me by users  of the AC anonymous board in a discussion  organized during the writing of this chapter,  among many possible contextual translations  of trolling such as hei [to smear], zhuonong  [playing with],  wunao  pen [mindless spray- ing], diaoyu [fishing] or yinzhan [to look for  a fight], some originated from specific geo- graphical areas and media environments – for  example,  in  the  case  of  shua  baimu  [‘play- ing  white  eyes’],  online  gaming  in  Taiwan   Figure 21.8 .  One of these many terms – diaoyu, which  literally  means  ‘fishing’  –  provides  a  clear   example of how social media practices can- not  be  assumed  to  map  smoothly  across  contexts.  Suggested  by  many  users  as  one  possible  translation  of  trolling,  fishing  is  commonly  practiced  by  posting  diaoyu  tie  [fishing  posts]  or  diaoyu  duanzi  [fishing  bits],  elaborated  texts  belonging  to  a  ver- nacular  repertoire  of  diaoyu  wen  [fishing  literature].  Diaoyu  wen  includes  fabricated  news  articles,  carefully  researched  pseudo- scientific  reports,  and  sensationalist  social  media  posts  written  in  specific  stereotypi- cal styles  de Seta, 2013, p. 311; Han, 2015,   p. 1014 . Here’s a ‘classic diaoyu bit’ kindly   ‘in Taiwan league of legends is really popular, and the word used in that   figure 21.8  game is shua baimu, it means something like playing carelessly on purpose and letting the  opponent win.’ anonymous replies to a discussion thread about trolling i opened on the ac  anonymous board   404  shared with me by one user of the AC anony- mous board:  There’re  surely  a  lot  of  wumao  here,  is  the  sen- tence  ‘giving  money  to  the  people’  enough  to  make  you  feel  uncomfortable?  Giving  money  to  the people is always be better than giving it to the  leaders, right? My classmate’s father took part in  the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, there  was one time he drank too much and told me that  the thing actually only cost less than five hundred  million  US  dollars.  So  the  question  is,  where  did  the  remaining  twenty  billion  dollars  go?  Just  let  your imagination fly. You shouldn’t always indulge  in comics and cartoons; if you have the chance, go  learn how to cross the firewall, you will be able to  see a different world. Since when we entered the  month of July, it seems like a lot of people support- ing the Party and the government have appeared  around here, summer holidays did really arrive uh.  This  diaoyu  duanzi,  known  as  sanxia  wuyi  [Three Gorges’s Five Hundred Million], was  originally posted in July 2012 as a comment  to  an  article  about  the  success  of  the Three  Gorges  Dam,  and  generated  over  one  thou- sand  responses  for  its  outrageous  claims  based on hearsay  Moegirlpedia contributors,  2015 . After  being  thoroughly  debunked  by  members  of  the  AC  community,  the  com- ment has been incorporated in a repertoire of  fishing  literature,  and  its  occasional  repost- ing  plays  on  multiple  layers  of  humor.  For  uninformed  audiences,  the  conceited  prose  reads  as  a  smug  mockery  of  discussion   board users themselves, described as narrow- minded  wumao  [‘fifty-cent’  paid  posters]  who waste their summer holidays on comics  and cartoons; when posted at the right time,  this  diaoyu  duanzi  might  successfully  elicit  replies  by  outraged  newcomers.  For  com- munity members in the know, the reproduc- tion of the post evokes the collective process  of  debunking  the  ungrounded  allegations  formulated by the original author, and stim- ulates  further  debate  about  the  formal  char- acteristics, discursive strategies and political  leanings  of  fishing  posts,  consolidating  the  community’s repertoire of diaoyu wen.  Compared  with  a  similar  practice  on  Usenet,  where  trolling  posts  are  customar- ily explained as confrontational gatekeeping  practices useful to protect specialized online  communities  from  the  unchecked  influx  of  newcomers, diaoyu is interpreted by discus- sion board users as an occasion to engage in a  collective fact-checking exercise in response  to widespread anxieties about the dissemina- tion  of  rumors  and  personal  accusations  by  paid  posters  and  propaganda  workers,  and  about  the  radicalization  of  political  con- flict  in  online  spaces   Wu,  2012,  p.  2227 .  The  communal  creation  of  a  repertoire  of  debunked  rumors  and  failed  provocations,  maintained  as  a  repository  of  community  knowledge  and  disseminated  for  in-group  amusement,  evidences  how  tightly  social   figure 21.9  i opened on the ac anonymous board  ‘a classic diaoyu bit.’ anonymous reply to a discussion thread about trolling     trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  405  media practices are tied to local sociotechni- cal contexts and situated experiences of use  across multiple scales. In the case of trolling  in  China,  these  include  everything  from  the  larger media ecologies of national platforms  and services to the massive linguistic context  of  the  Chinese-speaking  Internet,  down  to  the  infra-ordinary  experiences  of  discussion  board users and their situated interpretations  of specific media practices and texts.  social, media, pracTices  Even though the Victorian Internet, a term coined  by Tom Standage to refer to the telegraph system  of the late nineteenth century, did not include such  parasitical  entities  as  worms  and  viruses,  the   discursive  position  of  the  anomalous  was  filled  with other kinds of near-mythical instances of the  uncanny.  […]  Often  these  were  part  of  the  folk  culture of the new media rather than official con- cerns […]. Yet the short story “The Volcanograph”  introduces  how  weird  objects  of  network  culture  had  already  spread  in  the  nineteenth  century.   The  short  story  depicts  “hobgoblins”  who  keep  disturbing  proper  communicative  events.  The  unwanted  intruders  that  keep  “breaking  in”  on  the channels are given a lesson with the aid of a  telegraphic  bomb,  a  countermeasure  of  a  kind.   Parikka, 2011, p. 268   The mythologies of communicational distur- bances  uncovered  by  Jussi  Parikka  in  the  passages quoted above testify to the all-too- human propensity to make sense of problem- atic  presences  in  technological  networks  by  constructing  folk  cultures  of  new  media  populated by weird objects and uncanny fig- ures.  The  difference  between  nineteenth- century  hobgoblins  disturbing  telegraphic  conversations and twenty-first-century trolls  wreaking havoc on social media is that today,  these  near-mythical  figures  increasingly  embody official concerns about a wide vari- ety of media practices.  In  this  chapter  I  contended  that  social  media  practices  commonly  identified  as  problematic,  confrontational,  aggressive,  abusive, or antisocial are an important topic   of inquiry not simply due to their supposed  resistive or recalcitrant qualities, but because  they  exemplify  how  much  of  contemporary  media use is continuously constructed at the  intersection  of  infra-ordinary  experiences,  popular media narratives, and academic dis- courses. If it’s true that we  academics, jour- nalists, social media users  talk about trolling  only  through  polemics   Fuller  et  al.,  2013,   p.  1 ,  then  perhaps  this  chapter  provides  some directions to move towards more pro- ductive  problemizations   Foucault,  1984,  p. 384  of what the terms social, media and  practices imply when they are used to articu- late each other.  After recalling some first-hand experiences  of  problematic  online  interactions  from  my  early years of Internet presence, I argued that  social media practices are complex arrange- ments of technologies and usages, the articu- lation  of  which  is  unavoidably  grounded  in  individual  and  self-reflexive  experiences  across  time  and  space.  Trolling,  along  with  related problematic practices such as flaming,  spamming, cyber-bullying and online abuse,  belongs to a wider congeries of social media  practices  resulting  from  the  popularization  of  Internet  access  and  participatory  digital  media platforms. While portrayals of trolling  in  popular  media  have  repeatedly  oversim- plified  the  phenomenon  to  foster  anxieties  and  moral  panics  about  networked  commu- nications,  academic  research  has  painstak- ingly  attempted  to  account  for  the  practice  beyond such generalizations. In the first half  of this chapter, I proposed a genealogy of two  decades  of  research  literature  into  problem- atic social media practices by distributing it  along three axes of controversies: the tension  between descriptions of trolling as functional  component of Internet culture and its diagno- ses as deviant online behavior  Culture    Deviance ; the contrast between attempts to  derive a general definition of the practice and  efforts  at  emphasizing  its  situated  circum- stances   Definition     Contextualization ;  and  the  debates  between  sympathetic  reap- praisals  of  problematic  interactions  versus    406  their  critical  condemnation   Endorsement    Critique .  Mapping a selection of the existing research  literature along these three axes highlights the  various  theoretical  and  methodological  con- tributions provided by scholarly treatments of  the topic, and disproves the recurring claims  that  trolling  is  an  inexorably  understudied  phenomenon.  In  actuality,  a  sustained  cross- disciplinary  engagement  with  problematic  social media practices has resulted in impor- tant  conclusions:  trolling  isn’t  a  necessarily  antisocial  practice,  but  it  can  contribute  to  community  cohesion  as  much  as  damage  it;  confrontational  interactions  don’t  directly  result  from  the  technological  affordances  of  social media platforms, but can be mitigated  with  the  implementation  of  ad-hoc  meas- ures;  generalized  definitions  of  problematic  practices  can  be  useful  heuristics  for  further  research,  but  risk  flattening  or  misinterpret- ing their local articulations; and the positional  and  ethical  choices  made  by  the  researcher  ultimately  determine  which  productive  and  abusive aspects are emphasized or obfuscated  in  academic  accounts  of  problematic  social  media  practices.  The  choice  of  distributing  research literature along three axes describing  functional, epistemological and ethical contin- uums is not presented as a definitive mapping  of the field and can be expanded or reconfig- ured  according  to  different  dimensions,  but  has the advantage of opening up a wide vari- ety of possible approaches to the topic while  also hinting at zones of opportunity for future  inquiry: when, and where, is trolling defined  as  such,  and  by  whom?  How  is  the  prob- lematization  of  a  certain  practice  negotiated  between  communities  of  social  media  users  and  networked  publics?  What  positionality  does  the  researcher  choose  when  confronted  with problematic practices, and how are users  portrayed in the research output?  In  the  second  half  of  this  chapter  I  pre- sented a short overview of a research project  about  problematic  interactions  on  Chinese  social  media  platforms,  highlighting  how  the  loss  in  translation  of  the  term  trolling   has  lead  my  inquiry  towards  a  rich  reper- toire  of  locally  articulated  practices  tightly  connected  to  different  contextual  scales.  By  focusing  on  the  specific  case  of diaoyu  [fishing]  on  a  Chinese  discussion  board,  I  explained  how  the  communal  creation  and  dissemination  of  a  repertoire  of  debunked  rumors  and  failed  provocations  is  linked  to  national  media  ecologies,  informational  anxieties  and  platform-specific  interac- tional  practices.  Contrasting  a  predomi- nantly Anglocentric research literature with  a case study from China is not meant to be  a call to de-westernize social media studies  by  presenting  exotic  social  media  contexts  as  sites  of  difference  and  otherness,  but  is  rather intended as a way to question a prac- tice by drawing on ethnographic attention to  its situated articulations. Alireza Doostdar’s  account of ebtezaar [vulgarity] as a linguis- tic  practice  among  Iranian  bloggers   2004   and Sahana Udupa’s work on the social and  mediated  construction  of  gaali  [abuse]  by  Indian Twitter users  2015  are other exam- ples of this research approach. According to  Udupa’s  findings,  for  instance,  accusations  and dismissals of gaali are central concerns  for Indian Twitter users who want to engage  in  highly  confrontational  debates  around  Hindu–Muslim  politics.  Unraveling  the  situated articulations of the practice reveals  its  grounding  in  India’s  history  of  political  language  play,  its  role  in  ritual  social  rela- tionships  during  Hindu  festivities,  and  its  contemporary deployment as a gendered re- politicization of the domestic sphere  2015,  pp. 7–14 .  To conclude, it might be helpful to openly  situate  my  own  approach  to  problematic  practices  in  terms  of  the  same  axes  I  used  to  distribute  a  substantial  body  of  existing  research,  and  to  suggest  some  promising  directions  for  future  research  endeavors.  For my own inquiry, I adopt a neutral posi- tion on the functional axis  trolling is not a  constitutive  component  of  Internet  culture  nor necessarily deviant behavior , a radically  contextual  position  on  the  epistemological    trolling, and other ProbleMatiC soCial Media PraCtiCes  407  axis  trolling has to be understood in situated  social settings , and an agnostic position on  the ethical axis  my representation of trolling  doesn’t side either with or against the prac- tice .  These  choices  lead  to  my  preference  for  ethnographic  and  dialogic  accounts  of  trolling  and  other  problematic  social  media  practices, a solution close to the one Whelan   2013,  p.  57   derives  from  ethnomethodol- ogy:  ‘Naming  behaviour  as  trolling  is  not  deploying an objective and stable descriptor  to convey a meaning about a social practice  which is somehow itself before we get to it,  it  is  a  means  of  producing  a  social  practice  itself  as  meaningful.’  Considering  practices  as  being  constantly  produced  by  their  own  social and situated articulations is a promis- ing starting point to engage with the mythi- cal  figures  and  folk  cultures  of  new  media  beyond reductive dualisms and assumptions  regarding the homogeneity of sociotechnical  worlds  Crook, 1998 .  Following  these  decisions,  I  take  troll- ing  as  a  starting  point  to  understand  ‘the  place  of  provocation  in  its  multiple,  highly  contextualised  and  always  changing  forms’   McCosker, 2014, p. 202 , and as an exam- ple  of  how  problematic  practices  can  be  disentangled  from  the  polemics  developing  around  them. Another  advantage  of  an  eth- nographic approach to social media practices  is  its  sensitivity  to  the  ‘aspects  of  everyday  internet  use  that  often  remain  unnoticed’   Lovink, 2011, p. 10 . The capacity of tuning  into  the  trivial  everyday  that  Georges  Perec  would call infra-ordinary as its extends into  our sociotechnically mediated lives  Bassett,  2012,  p.  111   allows  ethnographically  grounded  inquiry  to  avoid  both  the  over- simplification  of  popular  media  narratives  and  the  overdetermination  of  disciplinary  discourses.  In  times  when  media  become  increasingly fluid ensembles of technologies,  platforms and forms of access, turning prob- lematic practices into problemizations of the  infra-ordinary experience of mediated social- ity can be a fruitful strategy to gain a better  understanding  of  the  interrelation  of  media   and  practice   Bräuchler  &  Postill,  2010 .   As  Perec  recognizes,  turning  towards  the  infra-ordinary  results  in  research  outcomes  that  appear  fragmentary,  apparently  trivial,  and ‘barely indicative of a method, at most of  a project’  1997, p. 178 . This, I argue, is in  fact what makes this turn essential: by mov- ing towards the domain of the trivial and the  infra-ordinary,  I  hope  that  my  contribution  provides a sense of ‘how thoroughly social,  how  culturally  and  semantically  articulated,  how under-determined and contingent media  production, reception and use are in practice’   Hobart,  2014,  p.  517 .  Grounding  ethno- graphic accounts of infra-ordinary mediated  sociality  on  such  radical  notions  of  under- determination  and  contingency  will  become  increasingly  essential  for  future  discussions  of  trolling  and  other  problematic  social  media practices.

M i l t n e r  inTroducTion  The fact that this chapter exists is somewhat  remarkable.  Not,  of  course,  that  approxi- mately  8,000  words  were  written  and  pub- lished in a massive tome  although that does  take quite a bit of effort , but the fact that a  major  academic  publisher  thinks  that  the  topic of internet memes is canonical enough  to include in a Handbook of Social Media. In  2010, you could count the number of schol- ars  interested  in  internet  memes  on  one,  maybe  two  hands.  Furthermore,  most  of  those scholars had to consistently make their  case  as  to  why  pictures  of  cats  with  mis- spelled  captions  or  videos  of  New  Jersey  teenagers  lip  synching  to  Moldovan  pop  songs were worthy of academic inquiry.  In our current media landscape, such argu- ments are less necessary. In the space of a dec- ade, internet memes have gone from quirky,  subcultural oddities to a ubiquitous, arguably  foundational,  digital  media  practice.  From  Comedy Central’s television program Tosh.0   to the endless listicles of Buzzfeed, an entire  media infrastructure has developed to report  on, disseminate, and dissect the newest piece  of digital culture to emerge, whether that is  weekly, daily, or hourly. As internet scholar  Ryan Milner  2016, p. i  notes in the intro- duction to his new book on memes, ‘it’s hard  to  imagine  a  major  pop  cultural  or  political  moment that doesn’t inspire its own constel- lation of mediated remix, play, and commen- tary’. Similarly, digital culture scholar Limor  Shifman   2013b,  p.  3   has  argued  that  our  media  landscape  is  governed  by  a  ‘hyper- memetic  logic’  where  ‘almost  every  major  public event sprouts a stream of memes’.  However,  while  memes’  omnipresence  may  make  meme  research  more  legible  to  both academic and lay audiences, it is not the  key to their significance. Memes were impor- tant before they were ubiquitous because they  represent  a  practice  of  vernacular  creativity   Burgess, 2006 , a blending of folk practices   such  as  storytelling   with  contemporary  media savvy and skill. In this way, they act    internet MeMes  413  like a funhouse mirror for culture and soci- ety, reflecting and refracting the anxieties and  preoccupations of a variety of social groups  across  a  series  of  national  contexts.  Memes  have  always  been  a  method  of  circulating  ideas and influencing discourse; they just do  so now on a grander, more rapid scale than  they  did  in  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s.  As Limor Shifman argues in her book Memes  in  Digital  Culture,  ‘internet  memes  are  like  Forrest  Gump.  Ostensibly,  they  are  trivial  pieces  of  pop  culture;  yet,  a  deeper  look  reveals that they play an integral part in some  of the defining events of the twenty-first cen- tury’  2013, p. 4 .  This chapter is constructed as a primer on  internet memes and internet meme research.  It  aims  to  provide  a  solid  foundation  in  the  theoretical and empirical work that has been  done  on  internet  memes  up  to  this  moment   2016 , while simultaneously illustrating the  significance  of  internet  memes  for  students  of  communication,  sociology,  anthropol- ogy, cultural studies, or any other discipline  invested  in  what  has  come  to  be  known  as  participatory culture  Jenkins, 2006 . It will  discuss the theoretical origins and definition  of  memes,  and  trace  the  history  of  internet  memes  from  the  late  1990s  to  the  current  moment. It will examine memes as a politi- cal and activist practice in cultures across the  world, and it will explore the process of com- modification that memes have undergone as  they moved from subcultural to mainstream  media realms. Finally, it will discuss the cur- rent state of meme research and avenues for  further scholarly investigation.  WhaT is a meme?  In  1976,  evolutionary  biologist  Richard  Dawkins  published  The  Selfish  Gene.  In  it,  he made the case for a new unit, a ‘cultural  replicator’ that spread ideas and behaviors in  an infectious, gene-like fashion among indi- viduals and populations alike. He called this   unit  the  ‘meme’,  short  for  ‘mimema’,  an  ancient  Greek  word  meaning  ‘that  which  is  imitated’ or ‘imitated thing.’ The concept of  the  meme  is  based  upon  the  principle  of  Universal Darwinism, which argues that any  information  that  is  varied  and  selected  will  produce design, whether that is biological or  cultural. That is to say, Dawkins believed that  information – whether in the form of a gene  or a song – is interested in one thing, which  is to be spread far and wide. Dawkins argued  that these ‘viruses of the mind’ – which can  be anything from the Happy Birthday song to  religious  beliefs  –  have  a  certain  agency  of  their  own,  and  propagate  themselves  to  ensure their survival.  While  Dawkins  has  since  distanced  him- self  from  memetics,  others  took  his  ideas  and  developed  them  into  a  field  of  study.  Scholars such as Richard Brodie  2009  and  Susan Blackmore  2000  argued that humans  are  merely  hosts  and  propagating  machin- ery  for  memes.  They  maintain  that  humans  developed to receive and spread memes, such  as  language  –  versus  the  other  way  around.  From this point of view, information is self- ish  and  strives  to  get  copied,  regardless  of  the  consequences.  While  controversial,  this  position  still  has  certain  proponents;  in  2014,  TechCrunch  journalist  Josh  Constine  explained  the  results  of  a  Facebook  social  influence study with the headline ‘Facebook  Data  Scientists  Prove  Memes  Mutate  and  Adapt Like DNA’, stating that ‘memes adapt  to their surroundings in order to survive, just  like organisms’  Constine, 2014 .  In  the  internet  studies cultural  studies  world,  memes  are  treated  as  media  objects  with particular characteristics and and asso- ciated  practices  instead  of  self-propelling  ideas. Media scholar Limor Shifman  2013a   argues  that  Dawkinsian  memes  and  internet  memes  are  both  social  phenomena  that  are  reproduced  by  various  means  of  imitation  and  are  diffused  through  competition  and  selection. However, Shifman  2013a, p. 367   contends  that  the  issue  of  human  agency  is  central  to  understanding  internet  memes,    414  defining  them  as  ‘units  of  popular  culture  that are circulated, imitated, and transformed  by individual Internet users, creating a shared  cultural experience in the process.’  Similarly,  Henry  Jenkins,  Sam  Ford,  and  Joshua  Green   2013   assert  that  internet  memes,  which  they  describe  as  ‘spreadable  media’,  are  successful  because  they  allow  different audiences to make their own mean- ings  from  the  same  media  artifact;  the  spe- cific  element  within  each  internet  meme  that  strikes  a  chord  will  differ  from  person  to person. Internet memes are texts, and like  any other text, different readers will interpret  them  and  put  them  to  use  in  varying  ways.  Other scholars  Miltner, 2014; Milner, 2016   have  argued  that  internet  memes  succeed  because of their ‘emotional resonance’ with  audiences; people share memes not because  they  are  mechanistically  compelled  to  pass  on a cultural replicator, but because they are  emotionally compelled by some aspect of the  media object with which they are engaging.  The  media  objects  that  come  under  the  aegis  of  the  term  ‘internet  meme’  are  far  from  uniform,  but  they  do  tend  to  fall  into  specific  categories.  As  Shifman   2013b,   p. 99  quips, ‘in theory, all Internet users are  free spirits, individuals who take their unique  path to the hall of digital fame. In practice,  they  tend  to  follow  the  same  beaten  tracks  of meme creation.’ These ‘beaten tracks’ are  genres,  ‘socially  recognized  types  of  com- municative  action’   Yates  and  Orlikowski,  1992,  p.  299   that  are  the  ‘keys  to  under- standing how to participate in the actions of  a community’  Miller, 1984, p. 165 . There  are dozens of genres of internet memes that  have their own rules, structures, stylistic fea- tures, themes, topics, and intended audiences   Shifman, 2013b . Some of the most recog- nizable  meme  genres  include  flash  mobs1,  recut trailers2, rage comics3, lip dubs4, image  macros5, and exploitables6.  However,  no  matter  what  the  subgenre,  Shifman  2013a  argues that internet memes  have three main dimensions that can connect  with audiences, or be used to create meaning:   content,  form,  and  stance.  The  content  of  internet  memes  refers  to  the  ‘ideas  and  the  ideologies’  that  are  expressed  in  the  meme.  The  form  involves  the  ‘physical  incarna- tion’  of  the  meme;  this  includes  the  format   a  video,  a  picture   and  the  ‘genre-related  patterns’ of the format  such as font and text  position, or whether the video is a lip dub or  fake  movie  trailer .  The  stance  of  a  meme  has  three  sub-components:  the  participa- tion  structures,  keying,  and  communicative  functions.  The  participation  structures  of  a  meme  involve  who  is  entitled  to  participate  and  how;  the  keying  of  the  meme  involves  the tone and style of communication; and the  communicative functions involve the type of  communication that is happening.  In order for a piece of content to become  memetic,  users  need  to  modify  at  least  one  of  these  dimensions.  This  is  the  key  differ- ence  between  ‘memetic’  content  and  ‘viral’  content; if a piece of content is passed along  intact  and  unaltered,  it  is  considered  to  be  viral. If a piece is altered or changed as it is  passed along, it is considered to be a meme   Shifman,  2013b .  For  example,  the  2009  performance  of  ‘I  Dreamed  a  Dream’  by  Britain’s Got Talent contestant Susan Boyle  is  a  viral  video,  since  it  was  passed  along  without  any  alterations.  However,  2012  K-Pop video Gangnam Style is considered a  meme, as it inspired a series of spinoffs and  imitations.  early inTerneT memes  The  exact  origins  of  the  very  first  internet  meme  are  somewhat  contested.  As  Lessig   2008  and Jenkins  1992  have argued, par- ticipatory culture did not start with the inter- net.  In  fact,  some  of  the  earliest  and  most  popular  memes  were  very  similar  to  offline  ‘memes’ from the 1970s and 1980s. One key  example of this is the demotivational poster  meme. Demotivational posters  or demotiva- tors   were  parodies  of  the  motivational    internet MeMes  415  posters  found  in  offices  and  classrooms  across the United States. Despair, Inc. was a  company  that  started  selling  demotivational  posters in 1998, and later created their own  online ‘Parody Motivator Generator.’7  Many of the first internet memes took the  form of ‘single-serving sites’  Kottke, 2008 ,  websites  consisting  of  a  single  page  with  a  domain  name  that  matched  the  content  of  the site. One of the earliest and most popu- lar  single-serving  sites  was  The  Hampster  Dance,  a  website  featuring  a  series  of  ani- mated hamsters rotating to a sped-up version  of  ‘Whistle  Stop’  from  Disney’s  animated  version of Robin Hood. The Hampster Dance  originally  appeared  on  web  community  and  hosting site GeoCities in 1998, gaining main- stream  popularity  in  the  early  2000s.  Other  famous  single-serving  sites  included  youre- themannowdog.com,  a  site  that  appeared  in  2001  and  featured  a  repeating  clip  of  Sean  Connery  from  Finding  Forrester  repeating  his notorious line, ‘You’re the man now, dog’   Asuncion,  2010 .  You’re  The  Man  Now  Dog   YTMND   developed  into  a  repository  of other single-serving sites, many of which  turned into memes of their own.  A  single-serving  site  featuring  a  gray  cat  is responsible for one of the internet’s most  longstanding  memes:  the  LOLcat.  In  2007,  blogger  Eric  Nakagawa  took  a  picture  of  Happy Cat, a grey cat originally featured in  a Russian catfood ad, and superimposed the  text  ‘I  Can  Has  Cheezburger?’  on  top  of  it   Tozzi, 2007 . He then posted the picture on  icanhascheezburger.com, and an internet sen- sation was born. I Can Has Cheezburger was  responsible for popularizing LOLcats, as well  as the image macro genre. While image mac- ros had been floating around subcultural web  communities  such  as  4chan  and  Something  Awful  since  the  early  2000s,  the  popularity  of I Can Has Cheezburger brought the image  macro – and for many internet users, memes  themselves – into the mainstream.  Many  of  the  earliest  internet  memes  in  the US context seem to traffic in the random  and  bizarre:  websites  with  repeating  loops,   pictures  of  cats  with  misspelled  captions,  and silly bait-and-switch pranks, where the  promise  of  an  interesting  news  story  turns  out to be a video of Rick Astley’s 1987 hit  Never Gonna Give You Up. However, early  memes were often cultural artifacts – some- times playful, sometimes not – that served to  erect and maintain in-and-outgroup bounda- ries  within  the  communities  from  which  they  emerged.  Many  of  these  early  memes  were  created  by  members  of  Something  Awful8  and  4chan9,  communities  whose  members  were  technologically  skilled  and  valued absurdist and often off-color humor.  Early  memes  that  emerged  from  these  col- lectives often reflected the tacit knowledge  and  technical  skill  required  to  appreciate  their  full  meaning,  making  them  inscru- table  for  outsiders.  They  also  reflected  a  specific  positionality;  many  memes  emerg- ing  from  what  Whitney  Phillips   2012   calls  the  ‘meme troll  space’  of  4chan  and  Reddit  had  decidedly  misogynist  and  rac- ist  overtones   Milner,  2013 . When  memes  like  LOLcats  moved  from  the  subcultural  to the mainstream, it was because their tex- tual flexibility allowed them to be taken up  and imbued with new meaning by different  groups  Miltner, 2014 .  Early  memes  in  other  areas  of  the  world  also  reflected  the  cultural  specificities  of  the  contexts  they  came  from. Animal-based  memes  in  particular  were  genres  that  popu- larized the practice of meme generation and  circulation.  Early  animal  memes  not  only  reflected  regional  humor,  but  cultural  and  political  interpretations  of  certain  animals  that  represented  a  specific  national  context.  In Japan, for example, the popularity of early  meme  favorites  OMGCat  and  Maru  reflect  the  historical  role  that  cats  have  played  in  Japanese  culture  and  folklore.  Some  have  argued  that  Maru  closely  resembles  a  bake  neko, or spirit cat – a frequently humanized  spirit guide with special powers who is also  an emblem of good luck  Romano, 2013 .  In  Kenya,  hyenas   mafisi   are  animals  that  are  seen  as  cowardly  scavengers,  and    416  have  lent  their  name  to  those  who  display  an  unseemly  sexual  desire:  Team  Mafisi   Kaigwa,  2015 .  In  2015,  Kenyan  lawyer  Felix  Kiprono  Matagei  was  put  on  Team  Mafisi  when  he  offered  50  cows,  70  sheep,  and 30 goats to marry sixteen-year-old First  Daughter Malia Obama  Pleasance, 2015 . In  Latin America, the image macro Ola K Ase   an intentional distortion of ‘hola que hace?’  or ‘what’s up?’  features a friendly llama, an  animal  that  is  indigenous  to  South America  and  has  played  a  role  in  the  economic  life  of  the  region  since  the  pre-Columbian  era   Berrin, 1997 . While Ola K Ase is an exam- ple of the linguistic playfulness that accom- panies  many  internet  memes,  it  also  has  been used to comment on political and social  issues,  including  corruption  scandals  and  gender  discrimination   Monroy-Hernandez,  2015   Figure 22.1 .  memes as poliTical pracTice  As several meme scholars have noted  Milner,  2013;  Shifman,  2013a,  2013b;  Miltner,  2014 ,  humor  is  a  key  component  of  many  memes, and a large part of what helps them  gain  traction  among  online  audiences.  However,  the  humorous  nature  of  memes  also makes them an ideal venue for political   critique  and  commentary.  From  the  days  of  the  court  jester  through  to  the  political  car- toon, humor has been a method for skewer- ing both people and institutions in the highest  echelons  of  power.  Furthermore,  as  Pearce  and  Hajizada   2014,  p.  68   have  argued,  humor can also ‘make a difference in mobili- zation and dissent.’ The use of Ola K Ase to  make a political statement reflects a practice  that  has  existed  since  the  earliest  internet  memes,  and  continues  to  be  one  of  the  pri- mary  reasons  that  memes  are  created  and  circulated today.  Memes in Authoritarian Regimes  One  key  example  of  the  political  use  of  memes  is  one  of  China’s  earliest,  most  famous, and popular memes: the grass mud  horse, or Cao Ni Ma. The grass mud horse is  a rare breed of alpaca that lives in the Male  Gobi Desert, which is constantly harangued  by its nemesis, the river crab. It also interacts  with  the  French-Croatian  Squid  and  the  Intelligent Fragrant Chicken. The story of the  grass  mud  horse  started  off  as  a  children’s  song,  but  now  there  are  grass  mud  horse  stuffed  animals,  animated  videos,  artwork,  and even lines of clothing; it is truly beloved  by many in China. While this little mythical  creature may seem innocent on its face, it is   figure 22.1  ola k ase   internet MeMes  417  actually a deeply subversive symbol of resist- ance  against  the  Chinese  censored  internet,  the Great Firewall  Wines, 2009 .  According  to  web  scholar An  Xiao  Mina   2012b , the grass mud horse’s name is pro- nounced ‘cǎonímǎ’ in Mandarin; this sounds  very  similar  to  ‘càonǐ  m¯a’,  which  means  ‘fuck your mother.’ The ‘Male Gobi,’ which  is pronounced ‘Mǎlè G¯ebì’, sounds like ‘m¯ale   ge  b¯ı’,  Mandarin  for  ‘your  mother’s  cunt.’  The  devious  river  crab,  or  ‘héxiè’,  sounds  like ‘harmony’  ‘héxié’  in Mandarin – a ref- erence to the fact that the Communist Party  refers to the censored internet as the ‘harmo- nized internet.’ The French-Croatian Squid is  pronounced ‘Fǎ Kè Yóu’, and the Mandarin  name for Intelligent Fragrant Chicken sounds  remarkably close to the Mandarin for ‘jack- ing off’  Mina, 2012b . As Shifman  2013b   points out, the humor of the grass mud horse  is the incongruity between the way the lyrics  are written  and meant to be read by the cen- sors   and  how  they  sound  when  spoken   or  sung  aloud: the lyric ‘on the vast and beauti- ful Male Gobi desert is a herd of grass mud  horses’ actually sounds like ‘in your mother’s  vast  and  beautiful  cunt  is  a  group  fucking  your mother.’  Shifman, 2013b, p. 148   The  appearance  of  the  grass  mud  horse  appeared in concert with the Chinese govern- ment’s ‘Special Campaign to Rectify Vulgar  Content’   Weiping,  2009 .  Its  genius  –  and  power – lies in the fact that although it is a  rather dirty pun, its literal meaning is entirely  benign; this means that it escapes the censors’   computers, as well as the government’s ban  on  ‘offensive’  behavior   Wines,  2009 .  In  a  2009 blog post, Beijing Film Academy pro- fessor  Cui  Weiping  explained  that  the  tone  of  the  grass  mud  horse  is  one  of  sly  obedi- ence:  ‘I  know  you  do  not  allow  me  to  say  certain things. See, I am completely coopera- tive, right? … I am singing a cute children’s   song – I am a grass-mud horse! Even though  it is heard by the entire world, you can’t say  I’ve broken the law.’  The grass mud horse is just one example  of an ‘alternative political discourse’ that is  taking place in China with the help of inter- net  memes.  The  China  Digital  Times  has  argued  that  internet  memes  have  generated  ‘frames,  metaphors,  and  narratives’  that  are  an  essential  part  of  a  ‘resistance  discourse’  that  undermine  the  authoritarian  regime  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party,  and  as  such,  are  an  important  venue  for  free  expression  and the development of civil society in China   Qiang, n.d., para. 2 . However, China is not  the only authoritarian regime where internet  memes also play this role: dissenting groups  in  Iran,  Egypt,  and  Russia   among  others   have  also  used  memes  to  speak  out  against  those in power. In Azerbaijan, the use of inter- net  memes  takes  on  particular  significance,  as Azerbaijan  was  one  of  the  first  countries  to arrest activists for creating and circulating  digital humor  Pearce and Hajizada, 2014 .  In  September  2013,  Azerbaijani  youth  activist  Ilkin  Rustemzade  of  the  Free Youth  Organization was arrested for ‘hooliganism’   figure 22.2  grass mud horse   418  for  posting  a  video  of  the  Harlem  Shake,  a  video  dance  meme.  Pearce  and  Hajizada   2014  explain that while the video itself was  non-political, the symbolism of Rustemzade’s  involvement with global internet culture  and  its attendant political ideas  was perceived to  be  threatening  to  the  government. This  was  not the first time such an arrest occurred. In  2009, ‘donkey bloggers’ Adnan Hajizada and  Emin  Milli  were  arrested  for  producing  a  YouTube video ridiculing the government for  spending  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  import  donkeys  from  Germany   Pearce  and  Hajizada,  2014 ,  and  in  2011,  a  group  of Azerbaijani students were threatened with  violence and military conscription for creat- ing a fake talk show that critiqued Azerbaijani  society and the government  ibid. .  The  use  of  memes  in  Azerbaijan  is  an  important  case  study,  because  it  illustrates  that while memes are often used as tools for  speaking truth to power, they can also be used  as  tools  of  oppression.  Katy  Pearce   2015   has shown that memes are a powerful source  of state-sponsored harassment in Azerbaijan.  She argues that their effectiveness lies in the  fact  that  memes  are  inexpensive  and  easy  to  make,  and  the  lack  of  attribution  usu- ally associated with memes is an affordance   that the regime uses to put distance between  themselves and the harassment they are con- ducting  Pearce, 2015 p. 1165 . Several key  opposition  figures  and  activists  have  been   the  subject  of  memes  that  ridicule  and  dis- parage them in an attempt to undermine their  credibility  and  authority,  a  weapon  that  is  particularly  effective  in  an  ‘honor  society’  like Azerbaijan.  Similar  tactics  have  been  used  in  Russia  to humiliate and discredit Ukrainian leaders  in  the  wake  of  the  Russia–Ukraine  conflict  of  2015–2016.  Ukrainian  President  Petro  Poroshenko  became  the  subject  of  a  series  of  Russian  memes  after  he  photoshopped  himself  in  the  place  of  Russian  President  Vladimir Putin on a cover of The Economist.  This prompted a flurry of photoshop memes  where Poroshenko’s head was put on a series  of  magazine  covers,  usually  on  the  bodies  of famous women: Kate Upton, Megan Fox,  and  even  the  Mona  Lisa   Sharkov,  2016 .  However,  the  Russian  government  –  and  particularly  President  Vladimir  Putin  –  has  also  been  the  subject  of  many  memes.  In  2011, a photo of Putin riding a horse while  shirtless  turned  into  a  photoshop  meme  of  Putin  riding  a  variety  of  objects,  including  bears and spacecraft  Figure 22.3 . Putin was   figure 22.3  putin riding bear   internet MeMes  419  also the source of memetic ridicule when it  was reported that voter turnout for the 2011  elections  exceeded  140%  in  some  regions   Abramovitch,  2011 .  For  the  Russian  gov- ernment,  the  use  of  humorous  memes  as  a  form of political critique is no laughing mat- ter;  in April  2015,  the  Russian  government  declared  a  ban  on  the  use  of  high-profile   figures in memes  Rothrock, 2015 .  Memes in Democratic Regimes  The  use  of  memes  as  parody  and  political  statement is not relegated to authoritarian or  otherwise  repressive  regimes.  Memes  have  been a major part of the American electoral  scene since artist Shepard Fairey created his  famous Hope poster and Obama was subse- quently  coined  ‘the  first  meme  President’   Beckwith,  2012 .  Memes  were  such  a  part  of  the  political  discourse  during  Obama’s  2012 re-election campaign that it was dubbed  ‘The Meme Election’ by a variety of media  outlets,  including  Salon   Jurgenson,  2012   and  The  Nation   Melber,  2012 .  While  memes had long been a part of online politi- cal  discourse,  this  election  brought  the  rec- ognition  that  memes  had  a  major  role  in  shaping  –  if  not  outright  dictating  –  the  media narrative surrounding each candidate.  From the ‘live-GIFing’10 of televised debates  to  the  Obama  campaign’s  meme-ridden  Tumblr, memes started to be recognized as a  powerful  form  of  political  expression,  par- ticipation, and agenda-setting.  One of the most significant memes from  the  2012  election  cycle  was  Binders  Full  of  Women,  a  meme  created  from  a  com- ment  made  by  Republican  candidate  Mitt  Romney  during  one  of  the  presidential  debates. When  asked  about  the  gender  pay  gap  by  a  female  voter,  Romney  responded  that  he  was  given  ‘binders  full  of  women’  to  choose  from  when  looking  for  qualified  candidates  to  employ  during  his  tenure  as  Governor  of  Massachusetts. The  gaffe  was  instantaneously  taken  up  by  women  across   a variety of internet platforms and formats,  from  animated  GIFs  and  image  macros  on  Twitter and Tumblr to reviews for three-ring  binders  on  Amazon.com.  While  Binders  Full of Women was similar to other memes  from the 2012 election in that it capitalized  on  a  sound  bite  and  was  met  with  a  satiri- cal  and  parodic  response,  it  had  a  longer  shelf  life.  This  was  primarily  because,  as  Carrie  Rentschler  and  Samantha  Thrift   2015, p. 332  have argued, the meme ‘dis- tilled a larger context of feminist critique of  the  Republican  Party’s  war  on  women  and  increasingly vitriolic online misogyny’ and  provided the women who participated with  an easy and humorous outlet to voice their  frustration and displeasure.  While  elections  and  electoral  cycles  are  rich environments for the generation and cir- culation  of  poltical  memes,  they  are  only  a  small part of the political memescape. Like  political  memes  in  authoritarian  regimes,  most political memes in democratic regimes  focus on critiquing, lampooning, and dissect- ing the quotidian goings-on of the people and  institutions in positions of power. In his book  Social Media and Everyday Politics  2016 ,  media  scholar  Tim  Highfield  argues  that  memes  outside  the  electoral  cycle  are  sim- ply how politics are discussed and dissected  by social media-literate, politically engaged  citizens.  Just  as  in  authoritarian  regimes,  memes in democratic nations are used to cre- ate  new  meanings  and  alternative  framings  of  particular  issues,  events,  and  public  fig- ures. Highfield also argues that political con- tent is often excellent fodder for the memetic  logics   Milner,  2015   that  increasingly  per- vade online cultural spaces. He also explains  that because the endless media coverage of  politicians  provides  boundless  material  for   commentary and remix, even small moments  can  be  turned  into  big  memes  if  they  are  offbeat,  unexpected,  or  ripe  for  mockery   Highfield, 2016 .  One key example of this was the davecalls  incident  on  Twitter.  In  March  2014,  British  Prime  Minister  David  Cameron  posted  a    420  photograph  of  himself  on  the  phone,  osten- sibly speaking to American President Barack  Obama about the crisis in Crimea. The photo  was  ruthlessly  mocked  on  Twitter,  with  users posting pictures of themselves in faux-  serious  poses  with  other  objects  held  up  to  their ears in lieu of phones: stuffed animals,  soda cans, beer glasses, and so on. Celebrities  also joined in on the joke; in particular, when  knighted actor  and prolific Twitter user  Sir  Patrick Stewart joined in by holding a cylin- drical container of wet wipes up to his ear, he  gave  the  meme  a  serious  boost.  Eventually,  Cameron  himself  got  in  on  the  joke,  tweet- ing  a  picture  of  himself  in  a  meeting  with  former President Bill Clinton to Stewart and  quipping to Stewart, ‘Talking to another US  President,  this  time  face  to  face,  not  on  the  phone.’  Cameron’s  photo  represented  a  meme- able moment for a variety of reasons. First,  Cameron  is  not  particularly  popular  with  certain  digitally  savvy  segments  of  the  UK   population,  and  there  was  a  distinct  senti- ment  among  this  group  that  Cameron  was  promoting  himself  and  his  leadership  skills  in  a  ridiculous  and  unnecessary  manner  with  the  photo.  Furthermore,  as  Alexander   2010   has  argued,  Western  citizens  are  deeply  skeptical  of  political  news  coverage  because they perceive it to be highly staged  and choreographed. On top of being cartoon- ish, Cameron’s picture played right into these  perceptions.  anoTher kind of poliTics:   memes as acTivisT pracTice  Humor  is  often  an  effective  tool  for  com- menting on the gaffes and hypocrisy of those  in power, and many political memes are used  to  comment  on  politics  in  a  humorous  and  parodic way. However, memes often reflect  and  invoke  the  rage  of  the  subordinated;   figure 22.4a  cameron tweet   internet MeMes  421  figure 22.4b  stewart tweet  Chinese  film  scholar  Cui  Weiping   2009   has referred to memes as one of the ‘weap- ons of the weak’ in our mediatized society.  While  that  may  be  so,  the  impact  of  some  activist memes illustrates just how powerful  they can be.  While  many  early  memes  emerging  from  the 4chan subculture were prankish and puer- ile, they also had their roots in  and occasion- ally  overlapped  with   a  hacker  culture  that  resisted and rejected traditional power struc- tures  and  norms.  As  Molly  Sauter   2014   explained  in  The  Coming  Swarm,  LOLcats  featured  prominently  on  the  Low-Orbit  Ion  Cannon   LOIC ,  a  tool  used  to  engage  in  civil disobedience in the form of Distributed  Denial of Service  DDoS  attacks on power- ful individuals and institutions.  However,  Chinese  netizens  were  one  of  the first groups to clearly illustrate the activ- ist power of memes. In July 2011, two high- speed  rail  trains  collided  in  the  suburbs  of  Wenzhou; 40 people died and over 192 others   were injured. After the Chinese government  claimed that there were no further survivors,  rescue  workers  found  two-year-old  Xiang  Weiyi  alive  in  a  train  car  that  was  being  demolished; this led to a great deal of criti- cism of the government and the overwhelm- ing sentiment that the government was more  interested  in  covering  its  tracks  than  taking  the  rescue  effort  seriously   Ding,  2011 .   In response to the government’s negligence,  a series of memes began circulating about the  train  crash.  Eventually,  the  outcry  reached  such  a  fever  pitch  that  top  Ministry  of  Railways officials resigned, and the govern- ment eventually issued a report on the cause  of  the  crash. Artist  and  researcher An  Xiao  Mina described the involvement of memes in  the  government’s  response  as  ‘a  watershed  moment’, arguing that ‘it forced the govern- ment to have more transparency’  quoted in  Subbaraman, 2012 .  Memes also played a major role in Chinese  citizens’  protest  of  activist  lawyer  Chen    422  Guangcheng being placed under house arrest  in  2011.  While  Chen’s  name  was  officially  censored  from  the  ‘harmonized’  internet,  Chinese  citizens  showed  their  support  for  Chen in other ways. One was by taking a Dark  Glasses portrait, a project created by digital  artist  Crazy  Crab,  which  exhorted  Chinese  internet  users  to  post  themselves  wearing  dark sunglasses or blindfolds to express their  solidarity for the blind lawyer. Like the grass  mud  horse,  this  was  designed  to  escape  the  censors,  as  it  would  be  rather  difficult  to  distinguish  between  a  Dark  Glasses  portrait  and a selfie on a sunny day. While Chinese  censors eventually caught on, certain images  escaped their grasp; there are still images of  Chen  circulating  on  photoshopped  posters  of The Shawshank Redemption. As An Xiao  Mina   2012a   explains,  the  significance  of  the  Chen  Guangcheng  meme  is  that  it  kept  awareness  of  Chen’s  plight  active  and  rel- evant  in  public  discourse,  a  state  of  affairs  that  would  have  otherwise  been  difficult  to  achieve in such a censored environment.  Mina also notes that memes played a simi- lar  and  equally  important  role  in  the  case  of  Trayvon  Martin.  In  February  of  2012,  seventeen-year-old  Martin  was  fatally  shot  in  Sanford,  Florida.  While  Martin’s  murder  is now a well-known event, there was origi- nally very little media coverage surrounding  his  death.  That  changed  after  digital  strate- gist Daniel Maree posted a video on YouTube  encouraging people to wear hoodies in honor  of Martin, who was wearing a hoodie when  he  was  killed.  Maree  called  his  movement  the Million Hoodie March, and it sparked a  vibrant  and  intense  discussion  in American  public  discourse,  a  discourse  that  was  fur- ther  amplified  when  the  Million  Hoodie  March  moved  offline  into  the  streets.  As  Mina  2012a  explains, ‘even in a democratic  country  with  broad  speech  opportunities,  it  can be difficult to gather eyes and ears around  an issue and even harder to sustain it in peo- ple’s  minds’,  and  the  hoodie  meme  helped  amplify and sustain Martin’s story – and the  surrounding  discussion  of  racial  profiling   and violence – in the media, both social and  broadcast.  Mina   2012a   also  makes  the  important  point that part of the success of the Trayvon  Martin  and  Chen  Guangcheng  meme  cam- paigns  lay  in  the  fact  that  they  were  organ- ized: Crazy Crab and Daniel Maree provided  clear instructions on how to participate, and  they  also  provided  a  central  repository  in  the form of dedicated websites to collect the   images  they  were  encouraging  people  to  make.  This  sort  of  organization  was  also  key  for  the  success  of  Black  Lives  Matter   BLM ,11  the  tour-de-force  hashtag-turned- movement  that  changed  the  American  dis- course  on  racial  justice  and  police  brutality  starting  in  2015.  In  their  seminal  study  of  40.8  million  tweets,  100,000+  web  links,  and  40  interviews  of  BLM  activists,  Deen  Freelon, Charlton D. McIlwain and Meredith  D. Clark  2016  argued that one of the main  contributing  factors  to  BLM’s  success  was  that  their  core  demand  of  ‘stop  killing  us’  was clearly articulated and agreed-upon from  the  start   Freelon  et  al.,  2016,  p.  83 .  The  BLM  movement  has  been  incredibly  suc- cessful in circulating narratives about police  brutality  and  racial  profiling  that  counter  the  ‘neutral’  narratives  in  the  mainstream  news media. Additionally, the content posted  in  connection  with  the  blacklivesmatter  hashtag  was  remarkably  successful  in  edu- cating casual observers on Twitter, illustrat- ing that ‘under some political circumstances,  political appeals on social media can do more  than reinforce people’s preexisting opinions’   ibid., p. 79 .  The meme-indusTrial complex  As the many examples of political and activist  memes illustrate, memes can be an efficient,  high-impact  method  of  spreading  a  message  or  idea,  and  they  also  have  the  potential  to  dominate popular culture during their time in  the limelight. Both of these affordances make    internet MeMes  423  memes  particularly  appealing  to  people  and  groups interested in making money, whether  that is advertisers, entrepreneurs, media com- panies, or other business interests.  Most successful memes are not created for  the  purpose  of  making  money.  Most  memes  are created for fun, to connect with a friend,  or to express some kind of personally relevant  statement,  opinion,  or  joke   Miltner,  2014 .  As one meme creator put it, ‘We’re spending  hours  making  these  fun  things  for  no  com- pensation,  and  not  even  any  recognition  …  just because of the inherent fun in it’  ibid.   Furthermore,  the  general  lack  of  attribution  that comes with the generation and dissemina- tion of memes may be good for authoritarian  governments  looking  to  distance  themselves  from their harassment of dissidents, but it also  makes  it  difficult  to  claim  ownership  –  and  consequently profit – from memes. Speaking  to  the  collective  nature  of  meme  creation,  one  LOLcat  enthusiast  explained,  ‘You  can  never  be  like,  “I’m  the  guy  behind  Ceiling  Cat”’  ibid. . As Phillips  2015  relates, early  memes  –  particularly  those  coming  from  subcultural  community  and  ‘meme  factory’  4chan – required deep subcultural knowledge  in order to both parse and participate in them.  However, the fact that certain memes weren’t  designed to be mined for profit failed to deter  those who saw them as an untapped commer- cial  opportunity. As  more  accessible  memes  crossed into the mainstream and became more  visible,  their  marketability  also  increased   Phillips, 2015, p. 139 .  The  first  person  to  create  a  sustainable  business  model  based  on  memes  was  Ben  Huh, an entrepreneur who purchased LOLcat  blog  I  Can  Has  Cheezburger   ICHC   in  2007.  Huh  recognized  early  on  that  ICHC  was unique in the internet media ecosystem,  and was able to pitch the uniqueness of ICHC  to venture capitalists, eventually raising over  US$2 million to purchase the site. In explain- ing his interest in ICHC, Huh said:  It was doing 500,000 page views a day for a cat  picture  site,  that  nobody  understood,  which  I   thought was fantastic. … And second, it was the  incredible  community.  It  had  amazing  buzz.  We  felt  like  that  there  was  a  pretty  good  possibility  that we were buying into a cultural phenomenon,  a shift in the way people perceived entertainment.   Cook, 2008   Huh used the advertising profits from ICHC  to acquire a collection of meme-related web- sites,  including  FAIL,  The  Daily  What,  Memebase,  and  meme  encyclopedia  Know  Your  Meme.  Huh  consolidated  the  websites  under the aegis of Cheezburger, a corporation  that received US$30 million in venture fund- ing,  made  $4  million  in  yearly  revenue,  and  employed 75 people at its peak  Erlich, 2011 .  Cheezburger has published five books – two  of  which  are  New  York  Times  Bestsellers  –   and was the subject of LOLwork, a short-lived  reality TV show on the Bravo network  Chard,  2010; Watercutter, 2012 .  While  some  applaud  Huh’s  savvy,  the  communities  that  were  responsible  for  the  generation of LOLcats and many of the other  memes that populate the sites of Huh’s meme  empire were less enthusiastic. In 2010, Huh  and 4chan founder Christopher ‘moot’ Poole  were on a panel at internet culture conference  ROFLCon, discussing the mainstreaming of  meme culture. Towards the end of the panel,  Poole  accused  Huh  of  being  an  ‘oil  tower’,  unfairly profiting off the unpaid labor of oth- ers,12  and  contributing  to  the  destruction  of  the  meme-creating  subculture  that  he  had  helped establish. ‘You can say “we’re giving  people  tools  to  create  LOLcats”  and  that’s  great and all’, Poole said, ‘but more or less  you’re giving people those tools so you can  post  them  on  your  site  because  you  mon- etize them with display ads. Do you feel like  you  put  something  back?  Because  I  don’t’   Phillips, 2015, p. 140 .  Poole’s  sentiments  were  expressed  in  a  less  politic  way  by  4chan’s   b   board13  in  November 2010 with Operation Black Rage.  Teen-oriented clothing retailer Hot Topic had  started selling t-shirts with Rage Comics on  them, a state of affairs that enraged  b ’s com- munity and spurred them into vengeful action.    424  ‘The corporate slut that is Hot Topic has now  decided that memes are to be the latest “cool”  thing  amoungst  [sic]  13  year  old  emo  con- sumer whores’, the flier for Operation Black  Rage groused. ‘This is only the beginning, if  this is allowed to continue then it’ll only be a  matter of time until  b  starts getting raped of  every meme to be turned into the next I Can  Has Cheezburger? And before long?  b  will  die.’ The plan for Operation Black Rage was  to create a series of racist Rage Comics and  subsequently  encourage  an  outrage-fueled  consumer  boycott  of  Hot  Topic  until  the  shirts were removed from shelves. The plan  originally  worked,  with  Hot  Topic  agreeing  to remove the shirts from their online store.  The  victory  was  short-lived,  however;  Hot  Topic  soon  became  wise  to   b ’s  campaign  and reversed their decision.  In the end,  b ’s fears were warranted: Hot  Topic’s commodification of memes was only  the  tip  of  the  iceberg.  In  the  years  that  fol- lowed, British company Virgin Mobile used  Success Kid14 in a cable television campaign;  American  startup  HipChat  used Y  U  NO15  on billboards around the San Francisco Bay  Area,  and  Wonderful  Pistachios  used  the  Honeybadger16  and  Keyboard  Cat17  in  tel- evision  commercials.  While  some  of  these  memes  were  created  and  popularized  by  a  collective,  such  as Y  U  NO,  many  of  them  contain media that can be traced back to an  original owner or creator; Keyboard Cat, The  Honey Badger and Success Kid all had video  or images that could be – and were – licensed.  Other  memes  that  were  created  by  a  single  author have also successfully capitalized on  their  intellectual  property.  The  creator  of  Nyan  Cat18,  Christopher  Torres,  has  mon- etized his creation through YouTube ads and  Nyan Cat merchandise; the owner of Tardar  Sauce,  more  commonly  know  as  Grumpy  Cat19,  has  parlayed  ‘Tard’s’  popularity  into  toys, books, clothing, animated specials, pet  food sponsorships, and even ‘Grumppucino’  iced coffee beverages. In Hong Kong, famous  cat Brother Cream has also received sponsor- ships and book deals.  The  road  to  meme  monetization  is  not  a  one-way street; some advertising campaigns  turned into memes of their own. Old Spice’s  ‘The Man Your Man Could Smell Like’ was  a memetic success that inspired imitations on  Sesame Street, Nickelodeon television show  iCarly, and the ad campaign for Shrek spinoff  Puss  In  Boots.  The  advertising  spokesman  for Dos Equis, The Most Interesting Man in  the World,  has  long  been  the  subject  of  his  own image macro template. However, brands  have  generally  not  met  with  much  success  when  it  comes  to  creating  truly  successful  memes.  This  is  because  memes  created  by  marketers  and  advertisers  are  seen  as  inau- thentic  and  ‘forced’.  Meme  encyclopedia  Know Your Meme defines a forced meme as a  meme that is ‘artificially created and spread  … made with the intent of becoming a meme  and  aggressively  promoted  by  its  creator’   ‘Forced Meme’, 2010 .  memeTic fuTures  By  2012,  the  commodification  of  memes  combined  with  other  shifts  in  the  digital  media  ecosystem  incited  a  series  of  dire  proclamations  and  death  knells  for  memes.  At the 2012 Digital Life Design  DLD  con- ference,  4chan  founder  Christopher  ‘moot’  Poole  mourned  the  end  of  internet  culture   Olsen, 2012 . After the final ROFLCon later  that  year,  technologist  Andy  Baio   2012   complained in Wired that the shift to mobile  social  i.e., primarily accessing social media  on a mobile phone  was quashing creativity.  On  his  blog,  Know  Your  Meme  co-founder  Chris  Menning   2012   declared  that  2012  was  ‘the  year  the  meme  died’.  In  his  book,  World  Made  Meme,  internet  scholar  Ryan  Milner   2016   tells  a  story  of  how  in  2014,  one  of  his  second-year  undergraduate  stu- dents  told  him,  ‘I  remember  memes.  They  were really big in high school. Junior year.’  It’s  true  that  the  body  of  texts  that  were  readily  identified  as  memes  by  a  specific    internet MeMes  425  cohort  of  internet  culture  enthusiasts  from  the mid-2000s to approximately 2012 are no  longer  in  vogue.  LOLcats, Advice Animals,  Rage Comics, Rickrolling and their ilk have  fallen  so  out  of  favor  that  they  have  been  given the meta-memetic label ‘dank memes.’  As Don Caldwell  2015  of Know Your Meme  explains it, dank meme is ‘an ironic expres- sion used to mock online viral media and in- jokes that have exhausted their comedic value  to the point of being trite or cliché’. As digital  scholar Whitney Phillips pointed out in 2012,  ‘the meme troll space of 2012 is very differ- ent from the meme troll space of 2008. The  question of whether or not that’s a good thing  is irrelevant – we are where we are, deal with  it’  Phillips, 2012 .  Much  of  the  research  on  memes  from  2014 onward has aimed to do just that – deal  with  the  shifting  memetic  landscape  and  understand  where  we  are  now,  although  as  Milner   2015   notes,  ‘it’s  easy  to  log  in  to  Facebook, see yet another goddamn Minion,  throw up our hands, and declare the death of  the subculture.’ For despite four years’ worth  of earnest declarations that memes are dead,  the  sheer  volume  of  memes  that  permeate  our media ecosystem illustrate that they are  very much alive; or rather, as Milner  2016,  p.  5   asserts,  memetic  participation  is  very  much alive:  Memetic  media  didn’t  start  with  4chan,  just  as  they didn’t end with the final ROFLCon. Memetic  practices persist, even if the specific resonant texts  shift  over  time.  If  we’re  tired  of  stock  character  macros in 2015, it doesn’t mean that ‘memes are  dead’; it indicates that those memes don’t hold the  specific cultural capital they did in 2010, or even  that  they  hold  cultural  capital  for  people  other  than us.  As  Milner,  Highfield,  Shifman,  and  others  argued in an October 2015 series on Culture  Digitally, much of our media engagement is  governed by memetic logics, whether that is  the platform vernacular of Twitter  Highfield,  2016 ; new modes of fundraising, like the Ice  Bucket Challenge  Silvestri, 2015 ; and new  forms  of  social  mobilization  in  the  form  of   or   trying   debates   BlackLivesMatter. At the time of writing, as  the  American  Presidential  election  of  2016  reaches fever pitch, so do the memetic texts  generated  about   and  perhaps  by  the  cam- paigns  of   Hillary  Clinton,  Bernie  Sanders,  Donald  Trump,  and  Ted  Cruz.  Whether  we  are  watching  Bad  Lip  Readings  of  the  Republican  to  MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain  at  the  exhorta- tion of media critic and late-night host John  Oliver,  user-driven  imitation,  remixing,  bri- colage, and circulation are at the core of our  media  engagement.  Furthermore,  these  behaviors and logics will continue to evolve  and expand long after the election – or what- ever  media  event  is  next  –  has  ended.  As  Milner  2016, p. 15  reminds us, ‘whether or  not the subculture has lost its edge, memetic  logics are as pervasive as ever.’  Notes   1   Flash mobs are coordinated events where a large  number  of  people  descend  on  a  location  for  a  short-lived purpose.

Children draw stick fig- ures  with  a  stick  in  the  sand.  Stone  Age  Australians  blew  ochre  dust  around  their  hands  to  leave  marks  in  a  cave.  Vikings  carved runes on sticks to tell the world their  names. Our grandparents kept diaries hidden  in drawers. Today we post selfies to Instagram  or Snapchat and write updates on Facebook  or  Tumblr.  With  social  media,  ordinary  people share their self-representations with a  larger audience than ever before.  In this chapter, I will discuss three modes  of self-representation in social media: visual,  written  and  quantitative,  building  upon  my  book Seeing Ourselves through Technology:  How  We  Use  Selfies,  Blogs  and  Wearable  to  See  and  Shape  Ourselves  Devices   Rettberg, 2014b . Visual self-representation  includes  selfies,  of  course,  but  also  other  images  and  icons  that  we  use  to  express  ourselves,  such  as  the  photos  we  choose  to  share on Facebook or the layout we choose  for a Tumblr log. Written self-representations   can  be  blogs  or  online  diaries,  but  also  the  many  written  status  updates  we  share  on  sites like Facebook, Twitter or in comments  on Instagram. The third mode I will discuss  is  quantified  self-representation,  which  is  becoming  increasingly  common  as  phones  become step-counters and apps give us more  and more opportunities to represent our lives  through  numbers  and  graphs.  Quantified  self-representation  can  mean  extensive  and  deliberate  self-tracking,  as  we  see  in  the  quantified self movement, or it can be some- thing as simple as swiping right to add a filter  to a Snapchat image showing the temperature  where  we  are  or  the  speed  at  which  we  are  moving.  Often  the  three  modes  overlap  in  social media, as with a Snapchat image that  includes numerical information. A selfie with  overlaid text uses both the visual and written  modes of self-representation, and emoji can  be understood both as part of an alphabet and  as visual communication.  In  social  media,  the  social  and  communi- cative  aspects  of  self-representations  become    430  very clear. But self-representations have always  been  social.  When  we  see  a  self-portrait  like  Parmigianino’s Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror   1524  hanging in a gallery or shown on a web- site, we see it outside its original social context,  and so it seems natural to understand it primar- ily as an object rather than as part of a conversa- tion. In fact, Parmigianino used his self-portrait  as  an  advertisement  for  his  painting  services,  bringing  it  along  when  he  spoke  to  potential  patrons.  Kings  and  queens  used  the  paintings  they commissioned of themselves to show their  subjects  their  magnificent  riches  and  power.  The child of today who draws her mother a pic- ture of the two of them together is creating a  love letter, a charm to keep her mother close to  her and to express her love. Even a private diary  is written to an imagined reader: ‘dear diary’,  we write, always imagining a recipient to what- ever  we  write,  even  if  that  recipient  is  only  a  future version of our self  Lejeune, 2000 .  Although  self-representations  are  always  about  communication,  they  are  frequently  personal media, to use Marika Lüders’ useful  term  Lüders, 2008 , and are often intended to  be seen by only a few. Some forms of personal  self-representation are intended to be shared  with a limited audience, like the family photo  album, which is a collective self-representation   of  a  family  that  is  kept  in  the  home  and  shown  to  some  but  by  no  means  all  guests.  Historically, personal letters and diaries were  not  necessarily  kept  completely  private,  but  were  often  passed  around  or  read  aloud  to  family and friends  Humphreys et al., 2013 .  Sometimes  personal  self-representations  become  shared  more  widely  than  originally  intended. Anne  Frank  kept  her  diary  private  during her lifetime, but it became very widely  read once published after her death.  represenTaTions or  presenTaTions?  Before discussing visual, written and quanti- tative  kinds  of  self-representation  in  social   media,  we  need  to  think  about  the  term   representation. Why are these forms of self- expression representations and not presenta- tions? The  short  answer  is  that  they  can  be  seen as either, because the two terms provide  two  different  ways  of  looking  at  this  phe- nomenon.  A  representation  is  an  object,  a  sign that is seen as constructed in some way,  and that stands instead of an object to which  it refers. Talking about representations lets us  analyse the selfie, the tweet or the graph of a  run. A presentation is an act, something that  a person does, so talking about presentations  allows us to analyse the way that the person  acts to present themselves.  It’s  a  little  more  complicated  than  this,  unfortunately.  The  terms  representation  and  presentation are used differently in different  disciplines,  making  their  use  quite  thorny  in  an  interdisciplinary  field  such  as  internet  studies.  Twentieth-century  linguistics,  with  influ- ential  scholars  like  Ferdinand  de  Saussure  and Charles Sanders Pierce, led to the semi- otic understanding of representation as a sys- tem of signs, that is, sounds, words, images  or objects that stand instead of a concept or a  thing. For instance, the word ‘tree’ is a sign  that refers to an actual tree. In his textbook  Representation  1997 , Stuart Hall describes  three  theories  of  representation:  reflective,  intentional  and  constructive.  In  the  reflec- tive approach, the sign or the representation  is thought of as a reflection of reality: ‘lan- guage  functions  like  a  mirror,  to  reflect  the  true meaning as it already exists in the world’   Hall, 1997: 24 . In the intentional approach,  one  assumes  that  ‘Words  mean  what  the  author intends they should mean’  ibid.: 25 .  However,  both  these  theories  are  seen  as  flawed by most contemporary scholars. Most  scholars today, including Hall, see represen- tation as constructed. A representation cannot  mirror  reality  because  we  all  have  different  experiences  and  interpretations  of  ‘reality’.  Also, words and images and other represen- tations can be interpreted very differently in  different  contexts  or  cultures.  A  suggestive    selF-rePresentation in soCial Media   431  message  sent  to  a  lover  means  something  very different within that relationship than it  means  if  it  is  displayed  to  work  colleagues  or  tweeted  to  the  world.  When  representa- tions are shared out of context, their meaning  is  often  constructed  differently  by  the  new  audience.  For  instance,  many  media  reports  on  police  shootings  of  African-Americans  use  very  informal  photos  of  the  victims. A  teenager may think it is fun to show a silly  or  embarrassing  party  photo  to  friends,  but  this kind of image is interpreted quite differ- ently when used by a newspaper to represent  the victim in a police shooting. The ifthey- gunnedmedown  campaign  on  Twitter  and  Tumblr  was  a  response  to  this.  Participants  posted two photos of themselves to Twitter,  or to the If They Gunned Me Down Tumblr,  where one photo was from a party or another  informal  setting,  and  the  other  photo  was  taken in a more formal or socially approved  situation:  a  college  graduation,  or  wearing  a  suit  and  smiling.  The  rhetorical  question  accompanying all the posts was which photo   the media would publish if ‘they gunned me  down’, and the implied answer was of course  that the media would use the less respectable- looking photo, making the African-American  victim  look  less  worthy  of  our  respect  than  if a more formal photograph had been used   Korn, 2015; Jackson, 2016 .  Semiotics,  the  study  of  signs,  provides  a  large  vocabulary  for  analysing  images.  The  most liked image on Instagram in 2015 was a  photo of Kendall Jenner lying on the floor in a  white, lacy dress with her hair spread around  her arranged into seven heart-shapes  Jenner,  2015    Figure  23.1 .  The  caption  published  with the image has no words, and consists of  a single emoji, a rotated black heart:    , which  is also treated as the title of the image in the  web browser.  ♥  In semiotic terms my short description of  the  image  and  its  caption  is  the  denotation  of  the  image  and  its  caption.  A  denotation  simply describes what is shown or states the  literal meaning of the sign without interpreta- tion. Jenner’s photo is obviously not a selfie,   figure 23.1  kendall Jenner posted this photograph to instagram on may 26, 2015   432  as her hands are visible in the frame, folded   over  her  stomach  as  though  she  is  laid  out  like  a  corpse.  She  couldn’t  have  arranged  her  hair  herself,  either.  The  image  can  still  be  seen  as  a  self-representation:  deliber- ately  staged,  photographed,  and  posted  to   her Instagram account, where it gained over  3.5 million likes.  The  most  interesting  semiotic  analysis  is  not  in  the  descriptive  analysis  of  the  deno- tation  of  the  signs,  but  an  analysis  of  their  connotations.  Connotations  are  common  associations connected to a sign, not private  associations  that  only  one  individual  might  have, but associations and references that are  shared by larger cultures or groups. Jenner’s  image  has  some  very  obvious  signs  with  well-established  meanings  or  connotations  in Western  culture.  The  hearts  that  her  hair  has  been  shaped  into  connote  love,  and  are  echoed in the rotated black heart emoji in the  caption. The choice of a black heart rotated  sideways  rather  than  the  far  more  common  upright red heart may suggest that though the  image is about love, it is a darker, more com- plicated love than that signified by a red heart.  The white lacy dress signifies a bride, which  again signifies love, and, in a traditional sense,  new,  virginal  but  soon-to-be-consummated   love  in  particular.  The  traditional  wedding  dress is white because white stands for inno- cence  in Western  culture.  Jenner  is  laid  out  like  a  corpse,  with  her  hands  folded,  as  is  traditional in Western funerals, and her eyes  are  closed.  The  floor  is  white  with  a  black  graphic  pattern  that  could  be  interpreted  as  suggesting  a  river,  although  this  is  not  an  interpretation  I  would  have  arrived  at  had  not the dead maiden with her outswept hair  made me think of Ophelia, the girl who loved  Hamlet and drowned herself. Paintings of the  drowned Ophelia always show her hair float- ing out in the water she lies in, and her dress  is often shown as white. Jenner’s photo is an  example of the way that death is frequently  aestheticised  in  Western  visual  culture,  and  we  could  certainly  take  the  analysis  of  the  image much further by thinking about why a   photo showing Jenner as a dead virgin is the  most liked photograph on Instagram. Gender  and  power  relationships  might  be  a  place  to  start. A  semiotic  analysis  always  begins,  though,  by  studying  the  image  or  the  text  itself and considering what signs it consists  of and what those signs signify.  Seeing  selfies  and  blog  posts  as  repre- sentations  is  something  that  makes  sense  if  you  are  considering  them  as  texts  to  be  interpreted  or  from  the  point  of  view  of  media  studies.  Another  important  theoreti- cal tradition has its roots with the sociologist  Erving Goffman, whose influential book The  Presentation of Self in Everyday Life  1959   is  heavily  referenced  in  scholarship  about  social  media.  Writing  well  before  social  media,  Goffman  describes  how  we  perform  and  present  ourselves  differently  in  face- to-face  interactions  with  different  groups  of people. On Facebook, a typical user will  be  friends  with  quite  different  groups  of  people,  such  as  close  family,  high  school  classmates, co-workers and distant relatives.  Social media theorists have used Goffman to  talk about how we try to manage these dif- ferent  audiences.  It  is  often  impossible  to  keep those contexts separate from each other,  a  phenomenon  called  ‘context  collision’  by  danah boyd  2011 .  If  we  were  to  analyse  Jenner’s  image  as  a  presentation,  rather  than  as  a  representa- tion,  we  would  focus  less  on  its  status  as  a  set  of  signs,  and  more  on  the  role  Jenner  was  performing  by  posting  this  image,  per- haps considering questions such as who the  image  was  intended  for,  where  and  when  it  was posted, what responses it was met with  and  Jenner’s  motivations  for  creating  and  sharing  the  image.  One  approach  would  be  to  interview  Jenner  herself  and  perhaps  also  people  who  had  seen,  commented  on  or  reposted  the  image,  but  it  would  also  be  possible to learn a lot from the image itself,  from studying Jenner’s other posts and from  examining  the  comments  and  the  contexts  in  which  the  image  was  republished  or  dis- cussed. We might compare the image to other    selF-rePresentation in soCial Media   433  images posted by non-celebrities, or perhaps  we  might  find  a  surge  of  homage  images  copying  or  playing  upon  the  Jenner  image.  Often ethnographers and sociologists want to  learn  about  practice  across  a  group  of  peo- ple, and so a study of self-presentation rather  than  self-representation  on  Instagram  might  explore how users typically create and share  images  rather  than  focusing  on  individual  examples like Jenner’s image. Other scholars  simply don’t use the terms representation and  presentation,  like  Katie  Warfield,  who  pre- fers  a  phenomenological  approach,  arguing  that focusing on the visual artefact of a selfie  often means ‘neglecting the fleshy producer  of  the  image,  who  in  the  case  of  selfies,  is  also the heart of the image’  Warfield, 2015 . Presentation  and  representation  are  also  used in different ways than those I have just  described. Aristotle  wrote  about  representa- tion as mimesis, that is, an attempt to realisti- cally mimic the world. This is similar to what  Stuart Hall calls the ‘reflective approach’ to  representation,  as  discussed  earlier  in  this  chapter. In theatre, some critics use the term  representational acting to describe the ‘natu- ralistic’ form of theatre where actors do not  acknowledge  the  presence  of  the  audience.  In  this  style  of  acting,  there  is  an  imagined  ‘fourth  wall’  between  the  actors  on  stage  and the audience, and audience members are  like  flies  on  the  wall  observing  the  action.  In  presentational  acting,  on  the  other  hand,  actors  acknowledge  the  audience  and  speak  directly  to  them   Bakshy,  1923:  12 .  Often  these  modes  of  acting  overlap,  as  in  litera- ture, where the narrator may invoke the ‘dear  reader’  at  times  while  at  other  times  telling  the  story  with  no  overt  acknowledgement  of  any  reader.  Another  use  of  the  terms  is  found in the field of interpersonal communi- cation,  where  John  Fiske  explains  that  rep- resentational  codes  produce  a  text  that  can  stand alone, whereas presentational codes are  ‘indexical:  they  cannot  stand  for  something  apart from themselves and their encoder,’ that  is,  the  person  who  spoke  or  communicated   Fiske, 2010: 63 .  Ultimately,  there  isn’t  necessarily  any  strict  difference  between  the  terms  repre- sentation  and  presentation  as  they  are  used  in  scholarship  on  social  media.  In  practice,  most  analyses  will  really  view  the  material  from both perspectives. In this chapter, I will  primarily consider expressions of the self in  social media as representations, but I use the  term fairly broadly.  In the next sections of this chapter, I will  discuss each of the three main modes of self- representation  in  social  media,  beginning  with  written  self-representations,  as  seen  in  blogs,  followed  by  visual  and  quantitative  self-representations.  blogs and WriTing abouT   The self  The  first  online  diaries  appeared  around  1994,  and  were  hand-coded  by  people  who  had  taught  themselves  to  create  websites.  One of the earliest online diaries was Justin  Hall’s Justin’s Links, which is still active at  links.net,  though  the  style  and  content  have  changed considerably over the years. At first,  the  website  took  the  form  of  a  meandering  hypertextual  story  about  Hall’s  life,  but  in  1996 Hall began posting dated diary entries  that  still  linked  and  intermingled  with  his  hypertextual  autobiography.  Hall  didn’t  call  his  site  a  weblog  until  much  later,  because  ‘web log’ at that time was used to refer to the  statistics available to website administrators  showing the number of visitors to a website.  In 1997, Jorn Barger proposed that the term  weblog be used to refer to websites that post  links  to  interesting  material  with  commen- tary   Rettberg,  2014a:  8 ,  and  a  number  of  hand-coded  weblogs  became  popular.  The  style  of  these  early  weblogs  was  brief  and  although  the  comments  usually  had  a  clear  individual  voice  and  offered  personal  opin- ions,  the  content  was  not  usually  autobio- graphical. Weblogs were often seen as being  different  from  online  diaries,  which  were    434  more  confessional.  In  1998,  Open  Diary  became one of the first sites to provide easy  web  publication  without  users  needing  to  know how to code or edit HTML  Rettberg,  2014a:  9 .  Instead,  users  picked  a  layout  from  a  set  of  templates,  and  wrote  their  entries into text boxes. 1999 saw the launch  of  sites  for  easily  publishing  weblogs,  or  blogs as they became known, including Pitas  and  Blogger.  Within  a  few  years,  the  once  quite  separate  genres  of  online  diaries  and  blogs merged. Blog posts became longer and  more essayistic, often using a more personal  voice,  and  online  diaries  came  to  include  more essayistic material and commentary in  addition to the autobiographical content.  By 2004 blogs were so popular that ‘blog’  was named word of the year by the Merriam- Webster, much as ‘selfie’ was named word of  the year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2013, and  both declarations were much discussed in the  mainstream  media.  Around  this  time,  com- mercial  blogging  took  off,  and  we  saw  cor- porate  blogging  as  well  as  individuals  who  created  their  own  profitable  businesses  by  blogging about their lives or about products.  Today  microcelebrities   Marwick,  2013;  Senft, 2013  and influencers  Abidin, 2015   tend to use multiple platforms rather than a  single blog, as early bloggers did. A popular  contemporary fashion blogger may have hun- dreds of thousands of readers a day, but often  spread  across  platforms  such  as  Instagram,  Facebook, Snapchat and a blog.  Although much interesting work has been  done researching people who have built their  own careers online and become Instagram or  blog  celebrities  or,  to  use  Crystal  Abidin’s  more  general  term,  influencers,  this  chapter  is primarily about the ways in which ordinary  people represent themselves in social media.  And  yet  the  line  can  be  difficult  to  draw.  Abidin   2015   emphasises  that  influencers  are ordinary people:  Influencers  are  everyday,  ordinary  Internet  users  who  accumulate  a  relatively  large  following   on  blogs  and  social  media  through  the  textual   and  visual  narration  of  their  personal  lives  and   lifestyles, engage with their following in digital and  physical  spaces,  and  monetise  their  following  by  integrating  ‘advertorials’  into  their  blog  or  social  media posts.  The main thing that differentiates influencers  from  the  majority  of  social  media  users  is  that influencers monetise their activity. They  use advertising, sponsorship and advertorials  to  make  money  in  social  media,  heavily  using  their  online  identities  to  make  their  message  personal  and  intimate,  and  using  emotions and designing empathetic commu- nication  Lövheim, 2013  with their readers  in order to establish strong, lasting relation- ships.  Other  celebrities  may  not  directly  monetise  their  self-representations  in  social  media, but use them as platforms to increase  their  influence  and  money-making  potential  in other channels, for instance driving inter- est  for  their  books,  TV-shows,  music,  Etsy  store or political cause.  Although  it  can  be  argued  that  social  media  forces,  or  at  least  encourages,  users  to promote themselves as brands  Marwick,  2013 ,  most  people  do  not  monetise  their  social  media  use. Today  people  write  about  their lives on sites like Facebook, Twitter and  Tumblr, as well as on traditional blogs, and  use these platforms to express themselves and  to build and foster connections with others.  Bloggers  themselves  have  long  recog- nised  that  blogging,  over  time,  can  be  a  way  of  becoming  more  sure  of  oneself  and  more  aware  of  one’s  preferences  and  opin- ions.  Rebecca  Blood,  a  very  early  blogger,  described her experience like this in an influ- ential early essay:  Shortly  after  I  began  producing  Rebecca’s  Pocket   I noticed two side effects I had not expected. First,  I  discovered  my  own  interests.  I  thought  I  knew  what  I  was  interested  in,  but  after  linking  stories  for a few months I could see that I was much more  interested  in  science,  archaeology,  and  issues  of  injustice  than  I  had  realized.  More  importantly,   I  began  to  value  more  highly  my  own  point  of  view. In composing my link text every day I care- fully considered my own opinions and ideas, and I  began to feel that my perspective was unique and  important.  Blood, 2000    selF-rePresentation in soCial Media   435  A couple of years later, Steven Johnson, an  author  of  popular  science  books,  described  blogging  as  being  like  a  mental  visit  to  the  gym:  I’ve  actually  been  about  twice  as  productive  as  normal since I started maintaining the blog. The  more I keep at it, the more it seems to me like a  kind of intellectual version of going to the gym:  having  to  post  responses  and  ideas  on  a  semi- regular basis, and having those ideas sharpened  or  shot  down  by  such  smart  people,  flexes  the  thinking writing muscles in a great way.  Johnson,  2002   Viviane  Serfaty’s  2004  study  of  blogging  connects blogs to the traditions of the English  Puritans, who used diaries as ‘a requirement  of  religious  self-  discipline’,  recounting  ‘a  spiritual journey towards personal salvation’   Serfaty,  2004:  5 .  During  the  same  period  the  Libertines  developed  the  idea  of  ‘an  inner space devoted to internal deliberation’   ibid.: 5 , which may be said to be one of the  sources  of  the  modern  divide  between  the  private  and  the  public.  Serfaty  writes  that  both  blogs  and  diaries  are  usually  written  more for the sake of the writer than for the  sake of the reader. They are used as mirrors,  she  argues,  to  reflect  upon  the  self,  more  than  they  are  used  to  project  a  particular  image  to  the  public,  as  might,  for  instance,  be the case in an autobiography intended for  publication.  Serfaty’s  book  was  published  in  2004,  before  the  commercialisation  of  blogs   Rettberg,  2014a:  Chapter  5   really  began,  and  before  social  media  went  mainstream.  While  much  of  what  she  writes  is  still  true  of today’s blogs, clearly many blogs are now  much more about branding, monetisation or  constructing  a  particular  image  of  the  self,  while much other use of social media is more  about keeping in touch with friends or shar- ing  quick  jokes  or  observations  than  about  self-improvement or developing ideas. A lot  of  the  discussion  that  previously  happened  in self-hosted blogs has shifted to corporate- owned  spaces  like  Twitter  and  Facebook,  where the space to write is far more limited   than in a traditional blog. Another shift is the  increased  emphasis  on  metrics:  how  many  likes,  shares  or  recommends  did  your  post  get? In the early days of blogging this was not  visible to readers. You could see where dis- cussions were taking place, but you couldn’t  calculate how important a blogger was based  on  numbers  at  the  bottom  of  each  post.  Perhaps one of the reasons why Snapchat has  gained  influence  is  that  people  are  relieved  not to have to see how many likes and shares  each snap they view has received. There are  some metrics in Snapchat; for instance, you  can see who viewed your own story, or who  opened a private snap you sent, but you can’t  like or share somebody else’s story, and you  can’t see how many views or likes somebody  else’s story has.  selfies and visual   self-represenTaTions  As  we  approached  2010,  smartphones  with  built-in  cameras,  good  screens  and  cheap  data  plans  became  common,  and  images  became  increasingly  important  in  social  media. At  the  same  time,  platforms  such  as  Facebook became mainstream forms of com- munication.  It  is  easy  to  forget  how  recent  these shifts are. The term ‘social media’ itself  was not in popular usage until 2008. Before  that, people talked about Web 2.0 and social  networking  sites,  and  before  that,  people  simply talked about the web or the internet.  Smartphones make taking, sharing and look- ing  at  images  easier  than  typing  or  reading  lengthy  blog  posts,  and  increasingly  self- representation  in  social  media  has  become  visual.  Of  course  there  were  visual  forms  of  self-representation  online  well  before  smart  phones. ASCII graphics were used in discus- sion groups in the 1970s and 1980s, photos  and animated gifs were used on early websites,  bloggers and Myspace-users chose graphical  templates and fonts that they felt represented     436  them, icons and visual avatars were used in  chatrooms  Thomas, 2004 , ‘camgirls’ of the  early  2000s  used  webcams  to  stream  their  lives online  Senft, 2008 , and photo-sharing  sites like Flickr  launched in 2004  were spe- cifically created for image-sharing. In today’s  social  media,  users  have  less  control  of  the  overall look of the page, and visual control is  generally limited to the choice of cover pho- tos, profile pictures and other images shared.  However, the images that are shared are given  prominence and are the main point of many  social media platforms.  Visual self-portraits are an age-old genre,  and  though  there  are  many  examples  in  art  museums,  the  most  interesting  examples  in  the context of social media, namely those cre- ated by ordinary people and intended for the  moment  rather  than  posterity,  are  probably  lost to us. It wasn’t until the late fifteenth cen- tury,  with Albrecht  Dürer,  that  self-portraits   became  their  own  genre,  rather  than  the  slightly  furtive  insertion  of  the  self  into  images  that  had  other  purposes   Borzello,  1998: 21 . Self-portraits became promotional  objects for artists, allowing a prospective cli- ent to assess the likeness between the painter  and  the  self-portrait.  They  were  also  done  for practice: even without access to a model,  if  an  artist  has  a  mirror  available,  they  can  always paint their own face.  Access  to  technology  that  would  allow  you to create a lasting self-portrait is a fairly  recent  development.  A  child  can  draw  her  face in the sand on a beach, but it will wash  away with the next waves. To create a last- ing  image  usually  requires  a  material  such  as  paper  or  marble  or  canvas  and  the  tools   to make marks on it, such as paints or pen- cils  or  tools  for  sculpture,  and  these  things  were  not  cheap  until  quite  recently.  Some  artists  have  managed  with  much  less,  such  as  the  Stone  Age  people  who  placed  their  hands  on  cave  walls  and  blew  ochre  dust  over  them  to  make  a  hand  print.  But  most  of the self-portraits we have preserved, up  until the last century or so, were created by  professional artists.  Some  of   the  first  photographs  ever  taken  were  self-portraits.  An  early  exam- ple  is  Hippolyte  Bayard’s  Self-Portrait  as  a  Drowned  Man   1840 ,  which  is  a  carefully  staged  self-portrait  showing  the  photogra- pher slumped against a wall as though dead.  Bayard claimed to have discovered photogra- phy before Daguerre, but was not recognised  for  this,  and  this  photograph  was  presented  as  a  criticism  of  the  French  Academy’s  failure  to  acknowledge  Bayard’s  work.  It  was  as  though  they  had  killed  him,  the  image seems to say, thrown him, dead, into   the gutters, and the words he scrawled on the  back  of  the  photograph  confirm  this:  ‘The  Government which has been only too gener- ous to Monsieur Daguerre, has said it can do  nothing  for  Monsieur  Bayard,  and  the  poor  wretch has drowned himself.’  This  is  not  only  one  of  the  first  photo- graphic self-portraits; it is also a staged pho- tograph,  deliberately  showing  a  scene  that  did not happen. As such the photograph is a  useful reminder that self-representations are  often  staged  and  not  always  intended  to  be  taken as truth, or at least not as literal truth.  Bayard did not drown. But taking this pho- tograph  not  only  allowed  others  to  see  him  as drowned, it allowed him to see himself as  drowned. It allowed him to see himself as he  could never see himself without technology  that recorded and displayed a frozen image.  We cannot see ourselves in a mirror with our  eyes  closed.  Self-portraits  can  be  a  way  to  communicate with others, but they can also  be  a  way  for  the  photographer  to  imagine  how he or she could be different.  When  Kodak  started  marketing  relatively  cheap  and  easy-to-use  cameras  to  amateurs  in the late nineteenth century, family photo- graphs  and  photo  albums  became  personal  media  found  in  many  homes.  Photobooths  also  became  popular  as  early  as  the  1910s  or  1920s,  first  as  amusement  park  attrac- tions  and  later  as  fixtures  in  train  stations  and  public  spaces,  where  they  were  used  to  take  the  standardised  portraits  that  had  become  necessary  for  identity  papers,  but    selF-rePresentation in soCial Media   437  also  for  fun   Pellicer,  2010 .  Photobooths  allowed ordinary people to take photographs  for  themselves,  and  without  a  photographer  being  involved.  If  you  search  online,  you  will easily find many examples of old photos  taken in photobooths, both of ordinary peo- ple and of celebrities, and it is fascinating to  see how similar many of these images are to  selfies taken today  Rettberg, 2014b: 42–44 .  People have a tendency to ham it up in pho- tobooths, and, as with selfies, group portraits  are common.  Twentieth-century  photographers’  self- portraits were often taken in mirrors, and often  positioned  the  camera  as  a  barrier  between  the  viewer  and  the  photographer   Borzello,  1998:  142 .  In  their  self-portraits,  profes- sional photographers like Kate Matthews  c.  1900  and Margaret Bourke-White  c. 1933   seem to hide behind their large cameras.  The  great  shift  from  these  mirror  self- portraits  to  today’s  selfies  is  that  selfies  are  usually  taken  on  a  smartphone  where  the  front-facing  camera  combined  with  the  screen allows the photographer to simultane- ously see and record herself  Warfield, 2014 .  The smartphone is a mirror that can capture  our reflection, at any moment. Once you own  a digital camera, you can take as many pho- tos as you like without worrying about using  up the film or having to pay to have the pho- tographs  developed.  Perhaps  it  is  almost  as  important that you can take photographs with  the  assumption  that  nobody  else  need  ever  see  that  photo. This  assumption  may  not  in  fact be true, as we know from scandals where  phones  or  private  photo-sharing  networks  have  been  hacked  and  photographs  posted  publicly. But we can still take these photos in  private, much as teenagers gaze into a mirror  when nobody is looking to wonder who they  are and who they might become.  A lot of interesting research on selfies has  been  published  in  the  last  few  years. Anne  Burns discusses the ways in which selfies are  used to discipline young women in particular,  using Foucault in her analyses  Burns, 2015 .  Katie Warfield interviewed women who take   selfies and found that they use selfies as cam- eras, stages and mirrors:  young  women  mediate  between  these  various  subjectivities  at  once  trying  to  find  a  balance  between an image that presents them as conven- tionally beautiful  the model , while also being an  image  that  others  would  want  to  see   the  self- conscious  thespian   and  finally  an  image  that  somehow represents a felt connection to the body  and one’s authentic sense of self.  Warfield, 2015   Katrin Tiidenberg has analysed Tumblr com- munities that share erotic selfies  Tiidenberg,  2014;  Tiidenberg  and  Gomez  Cruz,  2015 ,  while  Crystal  Abidin  has  written  about  the  ‘subversive  frivolity’  of  influencers’  selfies   Abidin, 2016 .  Much  of  the  research  on  selfies  as  vis- ual  artefacts  or  representations  focuses  on  what  Paul  Frosh  calls  nonrepresentational  changes: ‘innovations in distribution, storage,  and metadata that are not directly concerned  with  the  production  or  aesthetic  design  of  images’   Frosh,  2015:  1607 .  Frosh  instead  uses  concepts  from  the  theory  of  photogra- phy to argue that selfies are gestures, arguing  that while photographs have previously been  indexical  primarily  because  they  are  traces  of a material reality, selfies are indexical in  that  they  point  to  a  communicative  action.   The selfie ‘says not only “see this, here, now,”  but also “see me showing you me.” It points  to the performance of a communicative action  rather than to an object, and is a trace of that  performance’  Frosh, 2015: 1610 .  quanTified and auTomaTed   self-represenTaTions  While written and visual self-representations  have long, well-studied, pre-digital histories,  quantitative  self-representation  was  less  common  until  personal  computers  became  ubiquitous  and  powerful  enough  to  make  personal  data  collection  easy.  ‘Self  knowl- edge through numbers,’ is the slogan of the  quantified self  QS  movement. The idea of    438  self-improvement through self-knowledge is  a recurrent theme in self-tracking  Rettberg,  2014b:  62–68;  Lupton,  2016:  64–69 ,  as  in  social  media  in  general.  In  Status  Update,  Alice  Marwick  writes  that  ‘social  media  allows  people  to  strategically  construct  an  identity  in  ways  that  are  deeply  rooted  in  contemporary  ideas  that  the  self  is  autono- mous  and  constantly  improving’   Marwick,  2013: loc. 3091 .  habit   Benjamin   Franklin’s   track- ing,  described  in  his  autobiography,  is  an  early,  pre-digital  example  of  the  idea  of   self-improvement  through  self-tracking.  To  become a better person, he decided to track  how  well  he  adhered  to  thirteen  virtues  he  had  set  out  as  especially  important  to  him:  temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugal- ity,  industry,  sincerity,  justice,  moderation,  cleanliness, chastity, tranquility and humility.  He  drew  up  a  chart  with  a  column  for  each  day of the week and a row for each of the vir- tues, and gave himself a black mark for each  day he felt he hadn’t lived up to a virtue, and  two black marks if he had done very badly.  Looking  at  the  chart  in  his  autobiography,  silence seems to have been a virtue he strug- gled with in particular, with two black marks  on Sunday and one on Monday, Wednesday  and  Friday.  Order  was  difficult  for  him  too,  but he did quite well at resolution  Franklin,  2007 [orig. 1791] .  Today’s technology makes it easier both to  track your personal data and to analyse that  data. You might track how many cups of cof- fee you drink each day and compare that to  how  easily  you  fall  asleep  at  night,  or  how  many  productive  work  hours  you  have,  or  how often you have a headache, and then use  your  findings  to  try  to  optimise  your  sleep,  productivity  or  wellbeing  by  changing  your  coffee-drinking  habits.  This  kind  of  analy- sis is made much easier by computers. Self- tracking has gone mainstream largely because  it  is  built  into  many  devices.  Smartphones  now  have  built-in  step-tracking,  and  apps  like  Runkeeper,  Strava  and  Endomondo  let  you  track  runs  or  other  workouts,  showing   you how far and how fast you run as well as  offering  specific  workout  plans.  Dedicated  devices  can  measure  how  well  you  sleep,  how good your posture is or how often you  take deep breaths.  Several scholars have likened the increased  quantification  and  measurement  we  see  in  social  media  to  neo-liberalism,  pointing  out  that using metrics to measure every aspect of  our lives can make us cogs in a machine we  do  not  control   Lupton,  2013:  28;  Marwick,  2013:  loc.  105;  Grosser,  2014 .  Workplaces  are  increasingly  requiring  or  expecting  self- tracking  of  various  kinds.  Warehouses  like  Amazon’s  fulfilment  centres  track  workers’  every  move.  Other  companies  give  health  insurance  discounts  if  workers  log  a  mil- lion  steps  on  their  company-issued  Fitbits.  Sometimes tracking is required or encouraged  by employers to document that a worker is get- ting enough exercise in order to be a healthy,  productive worker  Till, 2014 . Coerced quan- tified  representations  of  ourselves  may  be  required or expected by employers or schools.  They are also generated and often displayed  to others when we use social media: the num- ber  of  likes  a  selfie  posted  to  Facebook  or  the number of retweets we get on Twitter are  displayed both to the person who posted the  material and to anyone else who views it. In  other  cases,  medical  conditions  such  as  dia- betes  require  constant  self-monitoring.  Self- tracking is not always optional.  Quantified   self-representations   also  include automated diaries, which are gener- ated by apps you can install on your phone,  or  the  algorithmic  self-representations  gen- erated  as  summaries  of  your  activities  on  various  services   Rettberg,  2014b:  45–60 .  Often, these are generated without your hav- ing  realised  that  your  actions  were  being  tracked as data that could represent you. For  instance, at the end of each year, customised  infographics are sent to users of Goodreads  and  Spotify  showing  an  overview  of  the  books the user read or the music they listened  to. For the last few years, Facebook has gen- erated  ‘Year  in  Review’  videos  and  photo    selF-rePresentation in soCial Media   439  collages from posts from each user in the last  year.  Google  Photos  automatically  stitches  together  videos  and  animations  from  users’  photos and videos, using facial recognition,  image search algorithms and metadata about  time and location to automatically create, for  instance, a video of a user’s ‘Christmas 2016’  or of their ‘Trip to Paris’. These sorts of rep- resentations are not necessarily seen as part  of the quantified self-movement, but they are  quantified  self-representations  because  they  represent  an  aspect  of  an  individual  using  quantifiable data.  These  algorithmically  created  diaries   Rettberg, 2018  are usually presented to the  individual  with  a  question:  Would  you  like  to  share  this?  Services  we  use  thus  collect  our data and present that data back to us as a  possible self-representation. Sometimes, you  might not even be aware that data about you  are being added to your social media profiles.  When Spotify posts a song you are listening  to to your Facebook newsfeed, that becomes  part of what others see as your self-represen- tation on Facebook, but you might not have  wanted the song to show up, and you might  not  even  notice  that  it  showed  up   Kant,  2015 .  Sharing  an  infographic  of  the  music  you  listen  to  can  feel  like  quite  a  personal  form  of  self-representation,  but  for  the  ser- vice  that  generated  it   Spotify,  GoodReads,  Facebook  or  another  company   it  is  also  a  mode of advertisement.  abundanT self-represenTaTions  In the time of one-to-many communication,  media were scarce. It was very expensive to  write,  edit,  print  and  distribute  books  or  newspapers,  to  make  and  distribute  movies,  or  to  create  and  broadcast  television  and  radio, so gatekeepers like publishers and pro- duction companies made sure that only mate- rial  that  was  either  commercially  viable  or  seen as aesthetically or ideologically impor- tant was published or broadcast. This meant   that we could assume a certain level of qual- ity when we picked up a book or a newspa- per,  or  turned  on  the  television.  Before  the  internet, individuals’ production of personal  media  was  also  limited.  While  paper  and  pens for writing a personal diary were easily  available  in  the  twentieth  century,  it  was  expensive  to  buy  film  and  to  have  it  devel- oped,  so  people  were  quite  selective  about  what photographs they chose to take. That is  why  home  photography  generally  centred  around  certain  rituals,  as  Pierre  Bourdieu  described in his book on amateur photogra- phy, originally published in 1965  Bourdieu,  1990 . We took photos at birthdays and wed- dings, and of happy families in the sunshine  at  the  beach,  but  not  of  our  laundry  or  of  walking  the  kids  to  school. We  didn’t  often  take photographs of ourselves.  With  digital  technology,  media  are  no  longer  scarce.  When  everyone  can  create  and distribute as much media content as they  please, there will obviously be a lot of mate- rial available that is not particularly of high  quality  and  that  will  never  be  of  interest  to  most  of  the  world.  That’s  OK,  many  blog- gers  argued  in  the  early  2000s   Mortensen  and  Walker,  2002 . You  don’t  have  to  read  or look at blogs and photos you’re not inter- ested in. We all have a vast amount of media  at  our  disposal.  Of  course,  this  also  means  that despite the potential for a huge audience,  most social media content creators will never  have  very  many  people  reading  or  looking  at  the  material  they  publish.  Andy  Warhol  famously said in the sixties that everyone has  their fifteen minutes of fame. On the internet,  Dave Weinberger and others have argued that  it’s more correct to say, ‘Everyone is famous  to fifteen people’.  And yet the accusation of shallow vapid- ity is one that recurs with every new form of  self-representation  online.  Blogs  and  selfies  have  both  been  accused  of  being  shallow,  of being expressions of narcissism, of being  boring. Back in 2002 when the first awards  were  established  for  blogs,  bloggers  Dave  Linabury  and  Leia  Scofield  founded  the    440  ‘Anti-Bloggies’, an award created to ridicule  bad  blogs.  They  explained  in  an  interview  with Wired magazine:  One  of  the  things  I  don’t  like  is  the  blog  where  someone  says  something  like,  ‘Today  I  had  a  cheese sandwich.’ That’s the kind of thing you see  in  most  of  these  blogs.  You  know,  fascinating.  I  don’t  give  a  flying  …  whatever  what  you  ate.  Don’t tell me you have a flat tire. And if this is how  boring their writing is, I can’t imagine how boring  they must be to talk to in general.  Manjoo, 2002   Similar criticisms have been levied at Twitter  and  Facebook  as  well.  Much  of  our  social  interaction,  whether  online  or  offline,  is  banal. Perhaps more accurately, it is phatic:  more  about  maintaining  connections  than  about conveying information  Miller, 2008 . The  quantified  self-movement  has  not  received the level of ridicule that blogs and  selfies suffered when new. Perhaps its numer- ical  basis  gives  it  a  sheen  of  objectivity,  a  sense  of  seriousness  that  blogs  and  selfies  will never have. Perhaps selfies are dismissed  because  they  are  often  seen  as  ‘feminine’   Burns, 2015 , whereas quantified self is seen  as masculine and therefore more serious and  worthy of attention.  Quantitative  self  data  may  appear  objec- tive, but we know that people negotiate with  their  data,  retelling  the  stories  of  their  days  to make their own experience match up with  the data. Researcher Minna Ruckenstein gave  her informants heart-rate variation monitors,  but  didn’t  show  them  their  data  until  after  they  had  already  told  the  researchers  about  their subjective experiences of the days they  had worn the monitors. Heart-rate variation is  an indicator of stress, and when the inform- ants  were  shown  the  data,  they  changed  their  stories  to  fit   Ruckenstein,  2014 .  Data  is  always  something  that  needs  to  be   interpreted. It is not an objective window on  truth,  any  more  than  visual  or  written  self- representations  are  reflections  of  ‘the  true  meaning  as  it  exists  in  the  world’,  to  quote  Stuart Hall again  1997: 24 . Viviane Serfaty  titled  her  2004  book  on  personal  blogs  The  Mirror and the Veil, arguing that bloggers use   their  blogs  both  as  mirrors  to  reflect  them- selves and see themselves better, and as veils  to hide behind. Self-representations are rarely  about trying to tell the whole truth and noth- ing  but  the  truth  about  ourselves.  They  are  as much about constructing a truth or many  truths about who we are and could be.  As objective as it may seem, even detailed  counting  does  not  necessarily  tell  you  very  much  about  a  person’s  life.  Sometimes  the  thing  measured  is  not  very  interesting,  as  when Samuel Beckett mockingly let his char- acter Molloy count farts in the novel Molloy:  Three hundred and fifteen farts in nineteen hours,  or an average of over sixteen farts an hour. After  all  it’s  not  excessive.  Four  farts  every  fifteen  min- utes.  It’s  nothing.  Not  even  one  fart  every  four  minutes. It’s unbelievable. Damn it, I hardly fart at  all.  Beckett, 1994: 39   Tracking farts is of course used as a mockery  of  obsessive  self-tracking,  or  of  excessive  attention to oneself, and the idea of this use- less obsession is echoed in the 2003 project  Statistics  are  Hot  Air,  in  which  artist  Ellie  Harrison   2003   tracked  her  ‘daily  gaseous  emission  output’  for  a  year.  Harrison  not  only  counted  all  her  farts  from  January  to  June 2003, she visualised them both as a bar  chart  on  a  paper  timeline  hanging  on  her  studio wall, and as a physical installation at  Moor  Street  Station  in  Birmingham.  The  physical installation is a large, colourful bar  chart on a glass window, and the vinyl stick- ers look like a purely decorative border at the  bottom  of  the  window.  Visualisations  of  quantified  self-representations  do  tend  to  have  a  decorative  aesthetics  that  sometimes  distracts  from  the  data  themselves,  or  that  perhaps  is  ultimately  more  interesting  to  us  than the data. We are driven by our desire for  patterns  and  completed  sequences:  a  gold  star  on  every  square  on  the  star  chart,  or  a  graph showing we have gone for a run three  times a week, every week.  The ultimately empty or purely decorative  function of Harrison’s chart of her farts can  certainly be read as a critique of quantitative    selF-rePresentation in soCial Media   441  measurements in general. The title Statistics  are  Hot  Air  equates  statistics  to  farts.  Both  are hot air, nothing at all, or worse, follow- ing the colloquial meaning of ‘hot air’, which  the  Oxford  English  Dictionary  explains  is  ‘Empty or boastful talk, pretentious or insub- stantial statements or claims’.  The  construction  of  meaning  in  quanti- fied  self-representations  can  also  be  seen  in  Molloy’s  fart-counting.  He  has  counted  exactly  how  many  times  he  has  farted  that  day, but is capable of interpreting that number  as  either  high  or  low. The  sentences  imme- diately  before  the  quote  cited  above  read:   ‘I  can’t  help  it,  gas  escapes  from  my  fun- dament  on  the  least  pretext,  it’s  hard  not  to  mention it now and then, however great my  distaste. One day I counted them.’  Despite having arrived at the figure of three  hundred  and  fifteen  farts  in  nineteen  hours,  Molloy manages to conclude that this is ‘noth- ing’,  adding  ‘Damn  it,  I  hardly  fart  at  all’.  Like the informants in Minna Ruckenstein’s  study, Molloy is skilled at interpreting data in  a way that suits him. Of course, knowing that  the author of Molloy was Samuel Beckett, we  can see that this is about a lot more than sim- ply  a  critique  of  self-measurements.  In  her  book Narratives of Nothing in 20th Century  Literature,  Meghan  Vicks  notes  that  ‘Even  when  Molloy  attempts  to  tabulate  the  most  mundane facts about himself, he arrives at an  ambiguity suggesting nothing’  Vicks, 2015:  123 . The idea of nothingness and emptiness  is important in Beckett’s work.  Twelve years after Harrison’s project, the  CH4,  an  automated,  wearable  fart  monitor  that you slip into the back pocket of your jeans  and  that  connects  to  an  app  on  your  smart- phone, was pitched on Kickstarter, but failed  to attract sufficient funding  Narciso, 2015 .  CH4 had a completely serious goal, and was  apparently developed with no sense of irony  or existential anxiety: the project aims to help  people emit less gas by measuring how often  they  fart,  comparing  this  to  what  they  eat,  and  finding  correlations  between  their  diets  and  farts  so  as  to  help  users  to  cut  back  on   the foods that increase wind. The interface of  the app that shows the users’ results contains  more  information  than  Harrison’s  colourful  bar  chart,  but  is  still  visually  pleasing.  The  website and the device itself conform to con- temporary  tech  startup  aesthetics:  the  web- site has large, high-quality photographs, and  responsive, scrolling design. The prototypes  of the device itself are shown as square with  rounded  edges,  and  come  in  white  as  well  as  pink,  blue  and  green.  CH4  fits  perfectly  into  the  rhetoric  of  quantified  self  and  tech  startup cultures – except it is about something  embarrassing:  farts.  Of  course,  farts  are  not  simply embarrassing, as we have seen, they  are also rich metaphors for nothingness, for  meaninglessness, for pretentiousness.  in   Self-representations   social  media   are  often  mocked  as  vapid,  self-obsessed,  frivolous – or simply boring. This is perhaps  where  seeing  them  as  representations  can  trip us up. Our everyday and scholarly tools  for understanding representations carry with  them  a  twentieth-century  worldview  where  we expect media to be professionally created  by the few for the many. We expect a represen- tation to be carefully crafted and packed with  meaning.  Social  media  self-representations,   on  the  other  hand,  are  personal,  social  and  often made for the moment, not for eternity.  When I share a selfie or post a Snapchat story  about my day, I am not usually trying to cre- ate  immortal  art  or  literature.  Sometimes  I  may aim to impress or entertain an audience,  or  to  put  something  deeply  significant  into  words  or  images,  but  more  often  I  am  nar- rating or visualising my experiences so as to  remember  them  better,  or  understand  them  better, or to strengthen a connection with my  friends,  or  to  ask  for  support,  or  simply  to  pass the time.  On the other hand, a self-representation is  precisely a representation. It shows a certain  aspect of ourselves, a certain way of seeing  ourselves. A representation does not and never  can share everything. We negotiate with our  self-representations, whether like the inform- ants  in  Minna  Ruckenberg’s  study,  retelling    442  their days to suit the data, or by taking dozens  of  selfies  before  choosing  the  one  we  want  to  share.  We  choose  what  to  share,  which  self-representations  are  appropriate,  but  we  share far more than the rituals and the happy  family  situations  that  Bourdieu  wrote  about  in the sixties. The social contract for what is  photographable  or  sharable  or  representable  is changing. New apps and devices and social  media services are constantly being offered to  us, and many fail. Others change our ideas of  how to tell our stories. There will surely be  more changes in years to come.  references  Abidin,  Crystal.  2015.  ‘Communicative  ♥  Inti- macies:  Influencers  and  Perceived  Intercon- nectedness.’ Ada: A Journal of Gender, New  Media & Technology, 8. http:  adanewmedia. org 2015 11 issue8-abidin .

Contemporary  practices,  such  as  sharing  sexy  selfies,  are  not entirely new. Since the 1990s, new forms  of  sexual  self-representation  –  such  as  text- based  ‘cybersex’   Atwood,  2013 ,  or  the  ‘peep-show’ aspects of webcamming – have  been  supported  by  proto-social  networking  sites  such  as  alt-sex  bulletin  boards  and   Pro Am  sites  such  as  SuicideGirls   Senft,  2008; Paasonen, 2011 . Within these spaces,  mediated  sexual  practices  that  might  previ- ously have been associated with commercial  sex work  or ‘taboo’ sexual subcultures  were  adopted  by  ‘ordinary’  people   see  Albury,  2002,  2004;  McKee  et  al.,  2002 .  Bulletin  boards focusing on sex and sexuality emerged  as spaces for aficionados of alternative  alt    sexual  practices  and  relationship  style  to  chat,  flirt  and  form  new  relationships. With  the  popularization  of  affordable  home  web- cams, sex-based sites expanded their capac- ity,  evolving  into  spaces  where  users  could  not only discuss their favourite porn  or swap  their favourite pictures and videos , but could  actively  participate  in  explicit  live  or  pre- recorded interactions with other enthusiasts.  Indeed,  the  rise  of  amateur  or  DIY  porn  enthusiasts  in  the  1990s  sparked  what  was  termed  the  ‘pro-am’  genre  in  commercial  pornography,  in  which  porn  studios  offered  fans  the  opportunity  to  perform  in  ‘candid’  web-cam  style  videos  with  star  performers   Albury, 2002 .  Early  internet  scholars,  particularly  femi- nists  and  queer  theorists,  explored  the  pos- sibilities  of  transcending  or  re-imagining  embodiment, sexuality and gender in MUDs,  MOOs  and  on  alt-sex  bulletin  boards   for  example,  see  Rheingold,  1991;  Bornstein,  1994; Turkle, 1995 . Despite this, as Gilbert  Herdt  and  Cymene  Howe  note,  ‘as  recently    sexual exPression in soCial Media   445  as the mid-1990s, experts reviewing sexual- ity  research  and  policy  completely  ignored  the  Internet’   2007:  4 .  Much  to  the  sur- prise  of  biomedically-focused  sex  research- ers,  online  and  mobile  digital  media  spaces  have  become  primary  sites  in  which  sexual  cultures  are  made  visible,  with  a  multitude  of  websites,  apps  and  social  networking  platforms proliferating commercial and non- commercial erotic images and written texts.  These  are  intermingled  with  and  scaffolded  by sexual health information, activism, peer  support, formal and informal pedagogy, and,  in some cases, harassment and abuse  Herdt  and Howe, 2007 .  These  practices  have  been  condemned   and celebrated  as evidence of the rise of a  ‘pornified’  culture  –  particularly  within  an  Anglophone  context   McNair,  2002 .  Some  platforms,  such  as  Grindr  or  Tinder,  which  primarily  represent  themselves  as  facilitat- ing  dating,  but  are  seen  to  promote  casual  encounters or hook-ups, have been castigated  in  popular  media  as  harbingers  of  a  ‘dating  apocalypse’  that  will  ‘tear  society  apart’   Riley,  2015;  Sales  2015 .  Others,  such  as  Facebook and Instagram, are officially ‘social  networking  sites’,  but  are  widely  used  for  meeting  new  intimate  and or  romantic  part- ners,  and  buttressing  existing  relationships.  In these ‘unofficial’ settings, reciprocal prac- tices of liking and sharing non-explicit digital  pictures  including profile pictures  can be an  effective strategy for indicating, or confirm- ing,  a  sexual  and or  romantic  interest   see  Aziz, 2014; Lenhart et al., 2015 .  Unsurprisingly,  both  media  scholars  and  sexuality  researchers  are  beginning  to  ask  new  questions  regarding  sexual  expression  in  these  spaces.  How  do  the  specific  tech- nological  attributes  or  affordances  of  social  networking services shape users’ experience  of sex, sexuality and gender? How do users  shape   or  resist   the  codes  and  conventions  of social media platforms? Are social media  platforms facilitating new, or different sexual  expression,  particularly  among  vulnerable  groups  and  stigmatized  sexual  subcultures?   Are they being used to control or coerce their  users?  Finally,  what  are  the  similarities  and  differences  between  sexual  expression  in  contemporary social media cultures and other  forms of online and offline sexual expression,  such  as  early  dating  platforms  and  amateur  webcam sites?  recenT hisTories of online  sexual expression  A  significant  body  of  early  research  into  sexual expression via mobile messaging and  picture exchange focused on gay men. In his  study of gay men’s adoption of mobile mes- saging,  Dowsett  concludes  that  these  prac- tices  suggest  ‘a  remarkable  shift  in  inciting  desire  rather  than  merely  representing  it’   2010: 269, original emphasis . Kreps  2009   and Mowlobocus  2007, 2010  explain eroti- cized picture exchange as a process of sexual  identity formation, in which ‘ordinary’ men’s  bodies  are  re-contextualized  with  reference  to pornographic genres of self-representation.   Further, both Mowlobocus  2010  and Tudor   2012  observe that pictures are deployed as  a form on non-verbal sexual negotiation, by  which  hook-up  app  or  dating  site  users  can  easily  indicate  their  ‘preferred  sexual  roles,  acts,  practices,  and  fetishes’   Mowlobocus,  2010: 208 . As Thomas Waugh’s  1996  his- tory of gay men’s amateur cultures of erotic  photograph shows, sexual representation, be  it  amateur  or  commercial,  can  take  many  forms. Each image, or collection of images,  Waugh  argues,  may  hold  different  meanings:  from the nonsexual portrait of the loved one, to his  unclothed  body;  explicit  depictions  of  fucking,  whether  nonloving  and  mechanical  or  imbued  with … romantic patinas …; both narrative repre- sentations   stories  of  desire   and  nonnarrative   views  of  the  object  desired ;  not  only  depictions  and  narrations  but  also  enunciations  of  desire    ‘I  love  you’  –  whether  reciprocated,  tolerated  or  unnoticed  … ,  performances   ‘here  I  am  being  desirable’ , and even prescriptions  ‘here is how to    446  make love’ ; from the psychological or spiritual to  the physiological, from the symbolic to the literal,  from  the  exalted  to  the  sleazy;  from  the  embroi- dery of the fetish or symbol, to the look that strips  bare.  Waugh, 1996: 7   The  history  of  heterosexual  picture-sharing  has been documented, too, and is found pri- marily in the field of ‘porn studies’, tracking  DIY cultures of mediated sexual expression  from  the  era  of  amateur  photography  described by Waugh, to the forums of Reddit  or 4Chan  see van der Nagle, 2013; van der  Nagel and Frith, 2015 . From the mid-1990s,  researchers have observed the increased vis- ibility  and  accessibility  of  peer-to-peer,  ‘domesticated’ online amateur porn sites and  webcam  communities,  noting  their  similari- ties  and  differences  to  older  analogue   networks of classified advertising, mail-order  catalogues  and  private  newsletters   see  Albury, 2004; McKee et al., 2008; Paasonen,  2011;  Williams,  2004 .  Similarly,  online  ‘sexseeker’ sites, such as AdultFriendFinder,  offer their subscribers the capacity to engage  in  online  picture-swapping  and  webcam  interactions,  as  well  as  facilitating  offline  hook-ups  Jacobs, 2010 .  A  range  of  researchers  have  documented  accounts  of  heterosexual  women’s  online  participation in sexual cultures that pre-date  contemporary  NSFW   not  safe  for  work   social  media  cultures.  For  example,  Rival  and colleagues’ 1998 ethnographic study of  an  Internet  Relay  Chat   IRC   site  for  porn  collectors found that female participants par- ticularly  enjoyed  opportunities  to  not  only  discuss their favourite porn, but to participate  in explict chat and webcamming, in order to  ‘explore desires which are too taboo, embar- rassing or dangerous for off-line life: mainly  bisexuality,  exhibitionism,  group  sex  and  promiscuity’  Rival et al., 1998: 301 . Writing  in 1997, US author Cleo Odzer described her  participation in similar environments as ‘the  freedom to be anyone and do anything, I had  sex with three men at once. I had sex with a  woman… Posing as a man, I had sex with a  man who was posing as a woman. I learned   all about S&M, as the sadist and as the maso- chist. I had all sorts of sex in every new way  I  could  think  of’   Odzer,  in  Waskul,  2003:  3–4 . In their study of a heterosexual amateur  webcam  site,  Kibby  and  Costello  observed  that it not only created a space for women to  engage in sexual play and self-representation,   but formed a community that both supported  heterosexual  women  as  voyeurs  and  pro- moted  heterosexual  men’s  exhibitionistic  desires  to  perform  for  women   Kibby  and  Costello, 2001 .  Early  webcam  communities  served  as  a  pleasurable space of play and fantasy, much  as  do  contemporary  social  media  sites  that  combine  picture  sharing  with  other  forms  of social communication  such as Reddit or  FetLife .  At  the  same  time,  these  amateur  porn and X-rated swap-sites seem to demon- strate  that  sex   even  pornographic  or  taboo  sex  is interconnected with everyday life. Not  only  did  participants  on  the  pic-trading  site  studied  by  Kibby  and  Costello  discuss  eve- ryday domestic issues, the online space itself  was  ‘domesticated’  in  participants’  discus- sions. These included, for example, the col- lective  formulation  of  guidelines  for  online  sexual etiquette and tips for negotiating jeal- ousy  and  competition  between  online  and  offline sex partners. As Rival and colleagues  described  it  in  1998,  ‘the  objectification  of  sexuality on-line appears to be fuelled at least  as often by the urge to order sexuality  and  IRC  relationships  and  practices  themselves   along ethical lines as it is to gratify it trans- gressively’  Rival et al., 1998: 316 .  These  early  webcam  and  collector  sites  appear  to  have  had  much  in  common  with  contemporary  social  media  feeds,  in  that  researchers  observed  that  ‘many  logged  conversations  move  within  minutes  from  tastes  in  porn  to  the  problems  of  single-  parenthood, money problems, dead-end jobs’   Rival  et  al.,  1998:  304 .  Similarly,  Kibby  and Costello observed that webcam chat was  ‘often grounded in the ordinariness of every- day life as people discuss where they’re from,  their age, their marital status, their jobs, their    sexual exPression in soCial Media   447  computer  problems  and  the  weather,  all  the  while displaying erotic images of their naked  bodies’   2001:  364 .  This  domestication,  accompanied  by  a  proliferation  of  explicit  texts and images featuring ‘ordinary’ bodies  and  ‘ordinary’  lives,  attracted  both  celebra- tion  and  censure.  On  the  one  hand,  DIY  or  cottage  industry  ‘porn  stars’  were  seen  to  promote  representations  of  erotic  diversity  that were not common in more ‘mainstream’  areas  of  commercial  media.  On  the  other  hand,  they  were  critiqued  for  normalizing  and homogenizing aspects of ‘pornified’ cul- tures,  including  the  conflation  of  feminine  ‘sexiness’  with  a  willingness  to  conform  to  hetero-centric  norms  of  bodily  display   see  McKee et al., 2008 . These tensions are still  evident  in  discussions  of  sexual  expression  within contemporary social media cultures.  These ‘cottage industry’ modes of online  sexual expression have been enhanced by the  emergence  of  platforms  such  as  YouTube,  Wordpress, Instagram and Tumblr  Paasonen,  2011 . Tumblr’s affordance of anonymity has  facilitated NSFW blogs, which serve a range  of purposes. These include fan communities  dedicated  to  sharing   or  re-blogging   sexu- ally  explicit  images  and  gifs  appropriated  from  commercial  pornography;  and  overtly  queer  and  feminist  blogging  communities  for  whom  creating  and  sharing  ‘sexy  self- ies’  is  a  mode  of  political  self-expression   see  Fink  and  Miller,  2014; Tiidenberg  and  Gomez  Cruz,  2015 .  As  Tiidenberg  and  Gomez Cruz observe, while amateur NSFW  selfie producers are not oblivious to broader  cultural  codes  and  conventions  of  sexual  attractiveness,  many  experience  their  prac- tices of sexual self -representation as a form  of resistance to cultural double standards. As  one blogger puts it:  I have always stood by my Tumblr in terms of my  rationale … because I’m not getting paid for this,  I’m not representing a company, I’m not wearing  Calvin  Klein  underwear,  I’m  not  in  any  way  mar- keting this. I am … this is a self exploration, this is  a finding of myself, and I … feel … if I were ever  to be … confronted with these images … my first   thing  would  definitely  be:  ‘I  don’t  see  what’s  wrong  with  it  because  I  was  of  age  and  I  was  exploring  who  I  am  as  a  person  and  I  don’t  see  what the difference is between Megan Fox doing  it  for  Armani  and  me  doing  it  for  myself.’   Tiidenberg and Gomez Cruz, 2015: 93–93   While some of Tiidenberg and Gomez Cruz’s  interviewees  report  feeling  uncomfortable  with the notion of ‘performing’ for their fol- lowers,  other  participants  in  DIY  social  media sex cultures actively seek out fans, and  solicit ratings, likes and upvotes. For exam- ple, contributors to the Tumblr site Critique  My Dickpic receive critical feedback, and are  rated on their composition and aesthetics on  a scale from A+ to D-  Holden, 2016; Sara,  2016 .  As Paasonen  2011: 95  observes, a DIY or  home-spun aesthetic is part of the branding of  NSFW Tumblr or Blogger sites, and indeed  the more ‘domesticity, authenticity, amateur- ism and realness’ the better. Australian porn  performer Zahra Stardust describes how these  representations of ‘realness’ and authenticity  are  highly  stage-managed  by  professional  producers:  Alternative nude modeling site Suicide Girls gives  calculated instructions on their website about the  kinds of photos, make-up and aesthetic sets they  accept:  tasteful,  picture  perfect  shoots  with  ‘a  little bit of face powder and mascara and freshly  dyed  hair,  but  specifically  not  cheap  wig s ,  top  hats,  stripper  shoes,  food  or  things  that  look  cheesy,  gross  or  creepy.  Similarly,  the  girl  next  door  look  of  the  Australian  all-female  explicit  adult site Abby Winters represents an alternative  to glamour photography, featuring make-up-less,  amateur  adult  models  –  but  models  are  still  required to cover up hair re-growth, remove pierc- ings, and not have any scratches, marks or mos- quito  bites  for  the  shoot  in  order  to  appear  healthy.  Stardust, 2012   At the same time, many contemporary ama- teur  or semi-amateur  sexual micro-celebrities    see Marwick, 2015  strive to reproduce the  codes  and  conventions  of  commercial  por- nography, adhering, in the main, to conven- tional  modes  of  youthful  heterosexual  femininity. As van der Nagle  2013  observes,    448  while  amateur  nude selfie  forums  such  as  reddit  gonewild  include  tagging  options  for  male, crossdresser and trans selfies, the site’s  algorithmic  favoring  of  ‘upvoted’  images  ensures that images of conventionally attrac- tive,  young,  white  women  dominate  the  forum’s ‘frontpage’.  It is not the case, then, that amateur sexual  self-representations are intrinsically ‘authen- tic’,  while  professional  sexual  representa- tions should be dismissed as ‘fake’. Instead,  the various forms of sexual expression out- lined  above  can  be  best  understood  in  the  broader context of what Burgess  2006  has  termed  the  ‘vernacular  creativity’  afforded  by  social  media.  As  Burgess  puts  it,  these  forms  of  creativity  are  not  rendered  inau- thentic by virtue of their references to com- mercial  aesthetics  or  mass  media  culture.  Rather, they represent ‘a productive articula- tion of consumer practices and knowledges’   in this case, knowledge of mainstream por- nographic  aesthetics   ‘with  older  popular  traditions and communicative practices  sto- rytelling,  family  photography,  scrapbook- ing, collecting ’  Burgess, 2006: 207 . Even  where  ‘false’   or  self-protective   practices  such as the use of pseudonyms are deployed  in  amateur  communities,  these  can  be  used  to  convey  a  sense  of  the  user’s  personality.  As van der Nagle and Frith  2011  note, such  practices  can  promote  intimacy  in  sexual  communities.  sexualiTy, inTimacy and   social media affordances  Social  media   a  term  I  am  using  here  to  encompass  both  application  and  web-based  platforms   offers  particular  technological  opportunities and challenges to users’ sexual  expression. While  sexual  expression  can  be  shaped  or  restricted by  the  affordances of  a  specific platform, including design features,  Terms of Service, network reach, and so on,  users may also need to find creative ways to   negotiate,  or  work  around,  the  platform’s  ‘official’ use.  As Gillespie  2010: 351  puts it ‘“platforms”   are “platforms” not necessarily because they  allow code to be written or run, but because  they  afford  an  opportunity  to  communicate,  interact  or  sell’.  However,  while  developers  may design interfaces that invite certain kinds  of usage, they cannot prescribe or enforce the  ways  that  apps  or  other  social  media  plat- forms are used. Platforms are always open to  ‘off-label’ uses – hook-up apps can be used to  find housemates, dating apps can be used by  job-hunters searching for contacts, and gam- ing platforms deployed as secure messaging  services   see  Bercovici,  2014;  Albury  and  Byron,  2016 .  As  Joshua  McVeigh-Schultz  and  Nancy  Baym   2015:  1   observe,  social  media affordances are intrinsically relational,  ‘defined  by  the  relationship  between  the  materiality of technological artifacts and the  lived  practices  of  communication’,  and  are  therefore always open to everyday practices  of improvisation and adaptation.  Drawing  on  Silverstone’s  domestication  theory   1992 ,  McVeigh-Schultz  and  Baym   2015: 2  focus on social media users’ every- day sense-making practices in relation to the  use  of  the  ‘microsocial’   two  person  only   dating relationship  app,  Couple.  In  paying  attention  to  Couple  users’  explanations  of  how they have learned to use and adapt the  app  within  their  relationship,  the  authors  demonstrate  the  ways  social  media  users  express relational intimacy within a specific  technological  environment.  Like  other  new  users of social media, Couple users ‘borrow  not  just  from  their  conversational  styles  but  also from how they already use other media’   McVeigh-Schultz and Baym, 2015: 3 .  McVeigh-Schultz and Baym’s study offers  a  useful  framework  for  mapping  the  ways  social  media  users  might  use  platforms  or  apps  to  express  sexual  desire,  curiosity  and  intimacy,  and  how  these  practices  might  be  constrained  or  enabled  by  technical  ele- ments such as design features and Terms of  Use.  The  authors  draw  on  Sabine  Trepte’s    sexual exPression in soCial Media   449   2015   categorization  of  ‘warm’  and  ‘cold’  affordances  to  unpack  the  contradictory  experience  of  mediated  sexual  expression.  On the one hand, as Trepte  2015: 1  argues,  social  media  platforms  offer  ‘warmth’  by  allowing users to connect with lovers, friends  and  strangers  in  familiar,  but  pleasurably  enhanced ways. At the same time, users are  constrained by ‘cool’ affordances. These are  less intuitive, and include restrictive Terms of  Use, in which, for example, developers claim  the  right  to  own   and  commercialize   user  content  Trepte, 2015: 1 .  For  Couple  users,  ‘warm’  interactions  involved  the  development  of  intimate,  and  private  ‘patterns  of  communication,  includ- ing  photo  taking  as  phatic  communication,  genres  of  sketching  as  gift  exchange,  and  “selfie”  videos  shot  and  posted  before  bed- time’  McVeigh-Schultz and Baym, 2015: 5 .  Other affordances are more difficult to clearly  categorize as either cool or warm, such as the  ‘forced reciprocity’ imposed by time-stamping   and  ‘Seen’  notifications  on  messenger  or  chat  apps.  As  McVeigh-Schultz  and  Baym  observe,  these  affordances  may  cause  one  partner  in  a  conversation  to  feel  obliged  to  respond to a message at a time and place that  may  not  suit  them,  because  they  know  the  other party  or parties  in a conversation has  automatically  received  a  time-stamped  ‘this  message was seen…’ notification  McVeigh- Schultz and Baym, 2015: 9 .  off-label uses and  Workarounds in sexual   social media  Yael  Roth’s  research  on  gay  hook-up  apps  raises  further  questions  regarding  the  intended and unintended effects of not only  social  media  affordances,  but  of  Terms  of  Service and other regulatory frameworks that  influence users’ modes of sexual expression   Roth,  2012,  2015 .  Roth’s  work  questions  whether Terms of Use and Terms of Service   are  simply  reflections  of  broader  market  restrictions  for example, the legal guidelines  for  selling  apps  via  the  Apple  Store  or  GooglePlay , or whether they are intended to  reflect,  or  prescribe,  normative  expectations  of  sexual  expression  within  particular  com- munities. These ‘cool’ affordances are often  not well understood by app or social network  users, and only become visible where there is  conflict or dissent regarding their interpreta- tion  most notably in the case of Facebook’s  takedowns of pictures of women breastfeed- ing  their  children .  Even  when  Community  Standards,  Real  Name  Policies  and  other  such  policies  are  explained  by  official  spokespeople, the interpretation and policing  of  the  rules  or  terms  can  be  opaque   and  unfair  from the users’ perspective. As Roth  puts it:  Would even a well-informed reading of an ideally  written policy correspond with the actual experi- ence of using an application or service? The basic  assumption  is  that  there  exists  a  necessary  and  direct correspondence between what a company  says  it  does  in  its  user  agreements  and  what  a  company  actually  does  –  and,  crucially,  why  it  does  it.  Knowing  the  rules  may  not  be  enough.   Roth, 2015: 4   There may be times, however, when the rules  do not matter. Where social media users do  know and understand the rules, they may still  communicate  via  coded  workarounds  to  signal specific sexual desires and interests, or  to  signal  an  interest  in  exchanging  explicit  messages and or pictures with others, such as  the use of eggplant emoji to flag ‘dick pics’.  This use of coded forms of communication,  incorporating hashtags and emoji, can lead to  a  push pull  struggle  between  users  and  app  developers,  as  content  guidelines  change  to  police new behavior, and users simply change  their  coding  and  practices.  For  example,  as  Roth outlines:  [The gay hook-up app] Manhunt … has specified  the  grammatical  circumstances  within  which  the  term ‘party’ may be used, in an effort to combat  drug references in user profiles: ‘The term “party”  isn’t allowed when used as a verb or adjective, but    450  as a noun such as in “sex party”, “dinner party” or  “group  party”  it  is  allowed’   Manhunt,  2009b .  These  guidelines  recognize  the  possibility  that,  in  online  spaces,  users  may  attempt  to  subvert   services’ limitations on their conduct by encoding  discussions  of  their  practices  in  ways  that  are   legible only to other members of the community –   to  circumvent  the  rules,  albeit  covertly.   Roth,  2015: 15   These struggles are not limited to dating and  hook-up apps. Users also circumvent Terms  of Use and codes of conduct to adapt ‘non- sexual’  social  media  platforms  for  off-label  sexual  purposes.  Journalist  Beejoli  Shah   2015  writes:  though  nudity  is  banned  by  Instagram’s  commu- nity guidelines, a cottage industry of illicit hashtags  has  sprung  up  to  find  and  share  these  photos,  everything  from  the  more  mundanely-phrased  seduced  and  exposed  for  broad  nudity,  to  the  community-specific tags such as femdomme and  daddydick, intended more for kink.  While  Instagram  has  famously  pushed  back  at  ‘wayward’  users,  banning  or  blocking  sexualized  hashtags,  and  other  signifiers  of  nudity  such as the eggplant emoji , each ban  has  heralded  the  emergence  of  new  worka- rounds   see  Hess,  2015 .  Shah  notes  that  while  Tumblr  and  Reddit  are  also  popular  platforms  for  sharing  nude  selfies  and  other  forms  of  amateur  porn,  Instagram’s  warm  affordances – and popularity – make it easier  to  access  via  mobile  devices.  This  is  espe- cially  the  case  for  users  who  combine  Instagram accounts with the anonymous mes- saging   and  sexting   app,  Kik:  ‘Instagram’s  onboarding  process  is  much  easier  –  point,  shoot, post – and cameras, Instagram and Kik  are all on one device that goes anywhere its  user goes’  Shah, 2015 .  Social  networking  services  such  as  Facebook are also deployed globally as dat- ing or hook-up spaces. The 2015 anthology  Online Courtship: Interpersonal Interactions  across  Borders   Degim  et  al.,  2015 ,  which  includes  accounts  of  digital  flirtation  and  dating  practices  in  the  USA,  Israel,  France,  India,  China,  Turkey,  Cuba,  and  Portugal,   contains  multiple  accounts  of  creative  uses  of social media sites for romantic and sexual  purposes.  These  practices  are  particularly  common  among  those  who  can’t  afford  to  pay to access to commercial venues  such as  bars and nightclubs , or apps with premium  features.  For  example,  Basile  and  Linne   2016   and  Aziz   2014   have  mapped  the  ways  young  urban  heterosexuals  in  Bueno  Aires  and  Paris,  respectively,  use  Facebook  to facilitate flirtation and courtship, particu- larly through practices of posting  and liking   selfies  and  group  photos. Wen   2016   notes  that  single  youth  in  Shanghai  increasingly  use social networking sites such as Renren to  seek partners, rather than subscribing to com- mercial online dating sites. Wen suggests that  many  Chinese  social  networking  sites  have  affordances that promote easy integration of  meeting and flirting with strangers into quo- tidian social networking practices. For exam- ple, some sites allow users to filter ‘friends of  friends’  by  relationship  status  when  search- ing  for  potential  partners,  while  providing  opportunities  for  everyday  interactions  with  existing  friends   including  game-playing,  picture-sharing  and  chat ,  without  having   to  switch  back  and  forth  between  apps    Wen, 2016: 107 .  It  should  be  noted,  too,  that  sexual   expression  in  social  media  is  not  limited  to  the  pursuit  of  sexual  and or  romantic   relationships – it can also deliberate sharing  of information for the purposes of peer sup- port. Just as the overtly sexual webcam and  IRC cultures studied by Rival and colleagues   1998   and  Kibby  and  Costello   2001   included  not  just  fantasy  material,  but  also  ‘ordinary’ discussions of domestic problems,  narratives  of  same-sex  attractions  and  first  sexual  encounters  shared  by  Instagrammers  and  YouTube  celebrities  can  be  more  than  clickbait  designed  to  elicit  ‘likes’   see  Duguay,  2016a .  In  her  ethnographic  study  of  Singaporean  ‘Insta-famous’  celebrity  bloggers,  Crystal  Abidin  observed  prac- tices of informal sexual pedagogy and peer- intimacy  in  an  environment  where  formal    sexual exPression in soCial Media   451  sexuality is lacking, and open discussion of  pre-marital  sex  and  same-sex  relationships  are condemned by schools and other political  institutions  Liew in Abidin, in press .  While these practices, which Abidin terms  sexbait, certainly can increase social media  celebrities’  fan-bases,  and  assist  them  in  attracting  sponsorship  opportunities,  these  first-person  accounts  of  sexual  learning  also  can fill a knowledge gap for fans  Abidin, in  press . For example, Abidin recounts celebrity  blogger Naomi’s disclosure of the conditions  in  which  she  lost  her  virginity   at  age  15 ,  and  observes  that  following  her  blog  post,  she  engaged  with  fans  on  Formspring  and  AskFM,  giving  sex  advice,  and  answering  questions  about  teen  sex  and  contraception   Abidin,  in  press .  This  intimacy  and  reci- procity can be seen as a gendered expression  of not only sexuality, but of care.  social media and The  micropoliTics of gendered  sexual expression  More overtly eroticized social media cultures  also involve reciprocity, although this can be  more  complicated  in  mixed-gender  spaces.  In  their  study  of  a  pre-SNS  webcamming  subculture,  Kibby  and  Costello   2001   observed that it is ‘easier’ for women to per- form as part of a reciprocal culture of ama- teur  exhibitionism,  due  to  the  centrality  of  women’s  bodies  as  erotic  objects  within  mainstream pornographic aesthetics  as out- lined above . As the authors observed, ‘there  is no sock equivalent to the fishnet stocking’   2001:  361 .  Further,  cock-rings,  uniforms,  and other forms of masculine erotic costum- ing were commonly dismissed by male cam- mers as homoerotic. Interestingly, Kibby and  Costello  note  that  both  male  and  female  members  of  the  1990s  webcam  community  were critical of male participants whose per- formances  defaulted  to  what  was  termed  ‘crotch-cam’, or the close-up framing of their   genitals  to  the  exclusion  of  the  rest  of  their  bodies.  This  early  ancestor  of  the  dick-pic  was not considered by community members  to  be  a  legitimate  ‘show’,  and  female  com- munity members frequently refused to inter- act with crotch-cammers, who were regarded  as ‘selfish’  2001: 361 .  It could be argued that aspects of hook-up  app and selfie cultures have created tensions  for  heterosexual  men,  who  are  required  to  ‘objectify’ themselves in selfies that focus on  abs or pecs, foregrounding their sexual desir- ability  Albury, 2015; Ringrose and Harvey,  2015 .  This  transition  to  a   masculine   cul- ture of visible desirability is not always easy.   On platforms like Tinder, where the prelimi- nary  introduction  is  a  profile  picture   with  or  without  significant  accompanying  text ,  heterosexual  men  must,  like  Kibby  and  Costello’s  webcammers,  present  themselves  as objects of a female gaze.  The position of straight men in the social  media  ‘marketplace’  is  somewhat  differ- ent  from  the  position  of  gay  men,  where,  as  a  range  of  researchers  have  outlined,  existing  cultural  practices  such  as  cruising  could  be  adapted  into  new  digital  reper- toires  Gundelunas, 2012; Roth, 2014; Race,  2015 . In their study of young Spanish het- erosexuals’  practices  of  exchanging  selfies  as  within  the  context  of  ‘digital  seduction’  via  social  media,  Lasén  and  Garcia   2015:  719   noted  the  discomfort  experienced  by  young  men  as  they  deliberately  studied  and  cultivated  practices  of  ‘self-pornification’.  The  authors  observed  that  visual  traditions  within Western  art  and  pop  culture   includ- ing  pornographic  examples  of  both  genres   primarily  depict  women’s  bodies  displayed  for  men’s  gaze.  Faced  with  an  absence  of  easy-to-mimic examples of hetero-masculine  erotic  self-representation,  some  young  het- erosexual  men  in  their  study   ambivalently   adopted poses from gay pornography in order  to  appear  attractive  to  prospective  partners   Lasén and Garcia, 2015: 720 .  It could be argued that the upsurge of vis- ual  cultures  of  erotic  flirtation  and  display    452   through  social  media  picture  exchange  has  provoked a micropolitical shift in normative  heterosexual  relational  dynamics.  William  Connolly  1999  deploys the notion of mic- ropolitics to argue that when even firmly held  personal beliefs  such as gender norms  con- tinue  to  be  ‘persuasive’,  a  curiosity  regard- ing the foundations of others’ beliefs creates  spaces  and  opportunities  for  ‘uncertain- ties  and  paradoxes’  to  emerge   1999:  147 .  These uncertainties, in turn, may allow for a  reconsideration  of  previously  incontestable  assumptions   that  is,  men  do  the  looking  choosing, women are looked at chosen  and a  conflict within the self. As a result, ‘what was  heretofore nonnegotiable may now gradually  become rethinkable’  1999: 147 .  This does not mean, however, that hetero- sexual men’s practices of ‘self-pornification’  are always undertaken for women’s pleasure.  While many incidents of picture-sharing are  consenting  and  reciprocal,  the  proliferation  of reports of women and girls receiving mul- tiple,  uninvited  dick-pics  suggests  that  such  practices can be aggressive, and even threat- ening   for  example,  see  Stevenson,  2016 .  This  conflict  between  some  social  media  users’  drive  for  sexual  expression  versus   others’ non-consensual exercises of sexualized  power and control is particularly vexed where  participants are aged under 18.  young people’s sexual  expression: legal and   eThical and social conTexTs  Since the mid-2000s, concern has increased  regarding young people’s participation in the  practice  of  sharing  sexually  suggestive   or  sexually  explicit   text  and  images   also  known as sexting . This practice is not always  facilitated via public social media spaces, but  also  in  private  groups,  by  direct  messaging   or  in-boxing ,  within  chat  and or  hook-up  apps   such  as  SnapChat  or  Tinder ,  and  by   means  of  person-to-person  text  and  picture  messaging using portable devices.  At present, the most detailed quantitative  information regarding the broadest context of  young people’s use of social media for sex- ual expression exists in the USA. According  to  the  Pew  Research  Center’s  2015  study  of US teenagers’ use of technology in rela- tionships, between 30% and 50% of all US  13–17-year  olds  surveyed  have  used  social  media  to  flirt  or  otherwise  interact  with  someone  they  are  attracted  to.  As  Baym   2015:  113   notes,  there  are  wide-ranging   and longstanding  anxieties in the USA, and  elsewhere, regarding the risks posed to both  adults  and  young  people  interacting  with  –  and  possibly  meeting  –  strangers  online.  Significantly,  relatively  few   about  8%   of  US teens in the Pew study reported dating or  hooking-up with someone they first encoun- tered  online.  Of  these,  ‘the  majority  met  on social media sites, and the bulk of them  met on Facebook’  Lenhart et al., 2015: 3 .  Participants  without  significant  experience  in  romantic  relationships  tended  to  pursue  a range of ‘entry-level’ practices when flirt- ing on Facebook, such as ‘liking’ posts and  photos, and sharing videos or songs  Lenhart  et al., 2015: 4 .  Around  one-third  of  those  who  reported  meeting a romantic and or sexual partner or  partners  online  described  a  purely  ‘virtual’  relationship, that is ‘a romantic relationship  with  someone  online  they  never  met  face  to face’  Lenhart et al., 2015: 12 . Of those  who did meet, many reported using multiple  social chat platforms  including online gam- ing sites  before exchanging phone numbers  and meeting in person  Lenhart et al., 2015:  18–21 .  This  use  of  multiple  platforms  to  establish  trust  and  intimacy  prior  to  meet- ing  face  to  face,  a  process  that  might   to  paraphrase  van  Dijck,  2013   be  termed  ‘an  intimate  culture  of  connectivity’  was  also  reported by Australian gay male participants  in the Young People and Sexting in Australia  study  Albury and Byron, 2016 .   sexual exPression in soCial Media   453  The Pew study notes that like the mobile  phone messaging that preceded them, social  media  platforms  can  promote  feelings  of  intimacy  and  closeness  between  romantic  and or sexual partners  see Gomez Cruz and  Cristina, 2015 . They can also provoke feel- ings  of  jealousy  or  lack  of  space  between  partners,  or  a  sense  that  the  relationship  is  overly exposed to the opinions of friends and  peers  Lenhart et al., 2015: 5; see also Baym,  2015 . A small percentage of those surveyed  by Pew admitted using social media to moni- tor or control a partner, with 4% installing a  tracking  app  in  their  partner’s  phone  with- out  their  knowledge,  and  11%  admitting  to  accessing  a  ‘mobile  or  online  account  of  a  current  or  former  partner’.  Ten  per  cent  admitted to changing or deleting a partner’s  social  media  profile,  and  10%  ‘imperson- ated  a  boyfriend,  girlfriend  or  ex  in  a  mes- sage’   Lenhart  et  al.,  2015:  10 .  Almost  a  third of respondents reported experiences of  being coerced or controlled by an intimate or  romantic partner via social media.  As  demonstrated  throughout  this  chap- ter,  practices  of  mediated  sexual  expression   including the consensual and non-consensual   production  and  sharing  of  sexually  sugges- tive  or  explicit  pictures   are  not  limited  to  any particular age, gender or sexual orienta- tion. Since the widespread global increase of  smartphone  ownership,  however,  concerns  regarding  ‘sexting’   as  opposed  to  picture  sharing  in  general   have  primarily  focused  on  young  people  –  particularly  young  het- erosexual  women  in  their  teens. As  a  range  of researchers have noted  see Albury, 2015   many  young  people  do  not  use  the  term  ‘sexting’  to  describe  this  practice,  referring  instead  to  sexy  selfies,  pictures,  or  nudes.  However, the term is widely used by educa- tors, policy makers and commentators, so for  the  purposes  of  this  brief  discussion,  both  ‘sexting’ and ‘picture-sharing’ will be used,  in conjunction with ‘selfies’.  There  is  a  range  of  legal,  technical,  and  to  young   socio-cultural   relating   issues   practices.   picture-sharing   people’s  In  Australia, for example, the age of consent for  all sexual activities is 16 or 17  depending on  State law . Since 2009, cases in Canada, the  USA, Australia and the UK have highlighted  the  risk  that  such  laws  present  for  young  people, who can be placed on ‘sex offender’  registers  for  producing  or  sharing  a  selfie,  even when all aspects of production and dis- tribution are undertaken with the consent of  all participants. In Australia, Commonwealth  law  defines  all  under-18s  as  ‘children’,  and  consequently  defines  any  sexual  represen- tation  of  under-18s  as  child  pornography  –   even  when  the  images  are  self-produced.  These laws, however, are justified  by some,  at  least   as  a  lesser  risk  when  compared  to  the  risks  posed  by  nonconsensual  picture- sharing,  known  colloquially  as  ‘revenge  porn’   see  Powell  and  Henry,  2014;  Henry  and Powell, 2015 .  Where  young  people  have  been  invited  to comment on their perceptions of the role  that  consent  plays  in  picture-sharing,  their  answers   like  those  of  adults   range  from  clear-cut  definitions  of  moral  and  ethical  boundaries,  to  victim-blaming,  to  confu- sion – as demonstrated within the following  extract  from  the  Young  People  and  Sexting  in Australia study  Albury et al., 2013 . The  project  invited  school-aged  young  people,  adult  stakeholders  and  same-sex  attracted  young people aged 18–26 to comment on sex- ting laws, and offer feedback on educational  resources  and  other  media  representations  of  sexting.  In  focus  groups  conducted  with  16-  and  17-year-olds,  participants  observed  that  sexy  picture-exchange  was  undertaken  on the basis of trust. However, that trust was  too  often  breached,  particularly  where  pic- tures  were  seen  by  young  men  as  a  trophy,  by which they could display masculinity and  or sexual capital to others  see also Ringrose  et al., 2013 :  Male 1:    This  isn’t  my  personal  view,  but  it’s  –  the  moment  a  female  sends  –  some  guys  see  it     454  Male 2:   Male 1:  Male 2:  Male 1:   as the moment she’s – they send her – him a  text  –  it’s  theirs.  It’s  their  photo. They  can  do  what  they  want  with  it.  She  voided  all  rights   to that photo, so – and they can – yes, they do  whatever they want with it.  It could be their photo, but it still counts as –  they only gave them their photo as trust. That’s  why they did it.  Yes, but that’s not a lawful, binding agreement. Yes, not lawful, but… Yes, so it’s based on morals.  Another group of young people debated the  likelihood of young men sharing images that  had  been  sent  to  them  in  the  context  of  an  intimate  friendship,  flirtation  or  romantic  relationship:  Male 1:   Male 2:   Male 1:    There’s  no  guy  who’s  been  sent  a  naked  photo of a girl who’s, like, not shown their  mates…  They’re  not…  no  one’s  gonna  ask…  Unless  it’s  like,  just  –  no,  but  if  you  ask  for  it  –  if  someone  asks  you  for  it,  they’re  definitely  going to show their friends.  They might not send to anyone, but it’s… they  definitely would show…  Female 1:       I think that’s a bit of a generalisation though.  G1   The  young  men  in  this  group  began  with  a  universal statement about their peers’ behav- ior  but,  following  a  heated  challenge  from  the  young  women  in  the  group,  sought  to  distinguish between young men who ‘asked’  for  pictures   who  were  presumably  more  likely to share them without permission  and  those who did not.  However,  the  16-  and  17-year-old  partici- pants  generally  agreed  that  picture-sharing  was only ‘offensive’ in the absence of consent:  I think sending explicit text or photos to someone  who doesn’t want them sent to them is probably a  problem, because usually, when I think about it, I  think  of  both  parties  being  consensual  and  both  taking part in it.   G1, F  If  it  stays  between  the  two  consensual  part- ners,  yes,  it’s  fine,  because  they  both  –  they  can  trust  each  other.  That’s  fine  because  it’s  their  choice.   G3, M   All  16-  and  17-year-old  focus  group  partici- pants opposed non-consensual production and  sharing  of  sexual  images,  and  indicated  a  general acceptance of legal penalties in these  circumstances. Similarly, in a half-day consul- tation with adult stakeholders, the consensual  production and exchange of pictures between  young people of the same age was generally  agreed to be unproblematic. There was, how- ever,  agreement  among  all  participants  that  relationships  between  peers  of  the  same  age  could be abusive, violent or exploitative; and  that those under-18s who shared photographs  without consent  or threatened to share them   in  this  context  should  face  penalties.  Interestingly, while all the school-aged partici- pants agreed that both young men and women  took naked or semi-naked selfies with a desire  to  ‘look  sexy’,  they  distinguished  between  selfies  that  were  intended  to  be  shared  with  friends,  either  via  direct  messaging  or  social  media   public  selfies ,  and  ‘private  selfies’  that were intended solely for purposes of self- reflection or self-regard  see Albury, 2015 .  geo-locaTion, sexual expression  and queer World-making  While  teenagers   particularly  teenage  girls   are the focus of most academic and popular  discourse  around  sexy  selfies,  picture- exchange   both  explicit  and  non-explicit   is  an essential aspect of intimate negotiation for  many  if not most  adult dating hook-up app  users. At  the  same  time,  digital  affordances  such as geo-location are ‘producing transfor- mations  in  these  practices  and  relations’   Race,  2015:  499 .  While  geo-location  is  a  significant aspect of ‘mainstream’ apps such  as  Tinder,  it  is  particularly  valued  in  apps  targeting LGBTQ people who have tradition- ally relied on geographical and architectural  markers such as bars, beats  or cottages  and  ‘gay villages’ to establish safe ish  spaces for  dating  and  casual  sex   see  Gorman-Murray  and Nash, 2016 .   sexual exPression in soCial Media   455  Both academic research and popular com- mentary on geo-locative dating hook-up apps  reports that users do not simply use apps to  directly  chat  or  hook-up  with  others,  but  to  ‘see’ other same-sex-attracted people in spe- cific geographical locations  see Albury and  Byron, 2016 . As Batiste  2013  describes it,  by  making  the  presence  of  registered  users  visible  to  others,  apps  present  users  with  the  ability  to  overlay  ‘queer  cartographies’  onto  ostensibly  heterosexual  environments   see  also  Blackwell  et  al.,  2014 .  However,  as Brubaker and colleagues  2015  note  fol- lowing  Schwartz,  2011 ,  while  geo-locative  apps can enhance a sense of community and  connection  for  some,  they  can  also  amplify  young  same-sex-attracted  users’  feelings  of  disconnection  in  remote  or  rural  areas.  Moreover, in countries where homosexuality  is illegal, same-sex-attracted men’s hook-up  apps  have  been  used  by  police  for  the  pur- poses of entrapment  Long, 2015 . App users  can  be  vulnerable  to  a  range  of  violations  of trust, ranging from racist abuse, shaming  based on HIV status, sexual violence, black- mail  and  robbery   Cowburn,  2015;  Power,  2016; Raj, 2016; Verass, 2016 . Additionally,  even  anonymized  information,  such  as  weight,  height  and  country  of  origin,  can  be  seen  to  jeopardize  user  safety  when  it  is   de-contextualized beyond an app. For exam- ple,  Daily  Beast  editor  Nico  Hines,  who  identifies  as  a  married  heterosexual  man,  caused  considerable  alarm  among  LGBT  commentators when he shared Olympic ath- letes’ personal details gleaned from his use of  Grindr within the Rio Olympic Village in an  ‘Olympic hookups’ story  Rodriguez, 2016 . Apps,  therefore,  could  be  seen  to  facili- tate not only dating or sexual encounters, but  other  forms  of  positive  and  negative  social- ity and sociability, via a process of off-label  use  see Castañeda, 2015; Albury and Byron,  2016 .  As  Roth  notes,  these  queer  cartog- raphies  can  change  users’  relationship  to  space  and  place:  ‘coding  spaces  as  “gay”  or  “straight”  becomes  less  important  when   an  application’s  grids  of  nearby  profiles  can be overlaid atop any space where a user  has a cellular data connection’  Roth, 2014:  2127 .  One  23-year-old  same-sex-attracted  participant in the Young People and Sexting  in  Australia  project  described  the  multiple  forms  of  ‘queer  world-making’  she  and  her  friends practiced as follows:  The app, for same-sex-attracted people, was a way  of making friends  when they were just coming out … I know my   friend who just moved to  [a new city], he got straight on there. He has a   partner of like, years, but  he got straight on Grindr when he went down   there to meet gay guys  who  could  be  his  friends  down  there.  So    I guess yeah, I think we use it  more for friendship than straight people a little   bit, if that’s possible.  This  same  participant  reported  using  hook- up apps with her friends while on road trips,  to  ‘see’  the  presence  of  other  same-sex- attracted  people  in  ostensibly  ‘straight’  regional  cities.  She  also  searched  for  local  same-sex-attracted women whenever she vis- ited  her  mother.  Her  aim  was  not  to  make  contact,  but  simply  to  affirm  their  presence  and  reduce  her  feeling  of  isolation  in  the  suburb  where  she  grew  up   Albury  and  Byron, in press . This use of hook-up apps is  not exclusive to younger people, as 51-year- old  Advocate  columnist  Jeff  Daniel  reports.  Daniel recounts his surprise  and pleasure  at  activating Grindr in his ‘working-class, blue- collar’ neighborhood for the first time, only  to  discover  he  had  radically  underestimated  the number of same-sex-attracted men living  nearby. As Daniel put it:  I  doubt  I’ll  ever  meet  most  of  the  people  behind  the smiling faces staring up at me from my smart- phone, but it’s comforting to know that I have so  many gay and bisexual brothers surrounding me,  and I’m sure that the younger generation of LGBT  people  in  my  neighborhood  feel  comforted  as  well.  Daniel, 2015    456  While  these  off-label  uses  of  geo-locative  apps  can  be  seen  to  promote  feelings  of  sexual  belonging  or  sociability,  it  is  the  exchange of chat and images that most char- acterizes  contemporary  sexual  expression  within social networking spaces. These prac- tices can operate quite differently within dif- ferent  sexual  cultures,  however.  As  Murray  and Sapnar Ankerson  2016  observe in their  study of Dattch  an app for same-sex-attracted  women , the design features of hook-up and  dating apps may invite users to participate in  picture-sharing in order to promote particular  kinds  of  sexed  and  gendered  interaction.  What  works  well  for  gay  and  same-sex- attracted men may not meet the needs of les- bian and same-sex-attracted women.  According to Murray and Sapnar Ankerson,  while  Dattch’s  developers  initially  offered  an  interface that was similar to Grindr, they found  that  same-sex-attracted  women  did  not  nec- essarily  want  to  hook-up  quickly,  rather  they  wanted  to  ‘get  to  know’  each  other  quickly   Murray and Sapnar Ankerson, 2016: 59 . With  this in mind, the developers deliberately ‘pin- terestified’ the app’s interfaces and enriched the  capacity for users to build visually rich profiles,  in order to speed up the ‘process of sociality  by  applying  the  success  of  the  highly  femin- ized space of fashion and shopping’  2016: 59 .  The authors argue that the aesthetics produced  by  these  design  choices  created  an  implicitly  white,  a-political,  hyper-feminine  ‘ideal’  user    2016:  66 ,  an  identity  that  was  amplified  when the app was re-badged with a gendered  pronoun  in  2016:  Her   2016:  66 .  This  case  study  illustrates  the  pressures  and  contradic- tions that emerge when commercial platforms  seek to standardize – and monetize – the sub- tleties  of  non-heteronormative  courtship  and  sexual expression.  sexual communiTy,   safeTy and sTigma  Platforms such as Gaydar, Grindr, OKCupid  and  FetLife  not  only  support  interaction   between  prospective  sexual  and  romantic  partners, but also provide spaces for engag- ing  in  ‘identity  work’  through  advertising  and  business  networking,  social  chat,  peer  support,  health  promotion,  commercial  and  scholarly  research  recruitment,  and  links  to  ‘offline’ social events and networking oppor- tunities   for  example,  see  Castañeda,  2015;  Wargo,  2015 . These  spaces  have  been  rec- ognized  as  being  especially  supportive  for  users whose sexual desires and or modes of  gender expression are highly stigmatized or  subject  to  repressive  legal  restrictions    see Bezrah et al., 2012 .  As  outlined  previously,  exchange  of  both  sexual  and  non-sexual  pictures  on  platforms  like Tinder and Grindr can form part of sexual  negotiations  with  new  partners,  serving  as  a  means of establishing ‘authenticity’, familiar- ity and trust before a face-to-face meeting  see  Albury and Byron, 2016; Duguay, 2016b . In  these  circumstances,  the  exchange  of  ‘face  pics’ may be perceived as more intimate than  an  exchange  of  anonymous  torso  or  genital  pictures.  However,  while  exchange  of  face  pics and personal details can promote intimacy  and trust, such exchanges also increase users’  vulnerability to predators and persecution.  While  more  mainstream  platforms  such  as  Facebook  facilitate  the  organization  of  affinity-based  groups  and  social  and  politi- cal  events,  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service  can  restrict  users’  capacity  for  sexual  self- representation. Facebook’s Real Names pol- icy  increases  the  risk  of  what  Marwick  and  boyd   2011   have  termed  ‘context  collapse’  for  same-sex-attracted  and  gender-diverse  users  who  are  not  ‘out’  to  family,  school- mates or workmates  see Lingel and Golub,  2015 .  Similarly,  members  of  BDSM,  kink  or fetish subcultures and communities can be  outed when group memberships, pictures or  ‘likes’ are inadvertently made public. While  kink-focused hook-up apps  such as Whiplr   are  available,  many  kink  practitioners  have  sought  out  the  broader  social  media  experi- ence of Fetlife, which could be described as  ‘kinky Facebook’.   sexual exPression in soCial Media   457  sexualiTy, sTigma and securiTy  in social media: The case   of feTlife  While  platforms  such  as  Tumblr  and  Instagram  allow  members  of  sexual  subcul- tures  to  deploy  pseudonyms,  their Terms  of  Service are not always supportive of explicit  sexual  expression.  In  contrast,  the  kink- focused social network FetLife not only per- mits  the  use  of  pseudonyms,  but  actively  allows   and  encourages   posting  of  explicit  sexual pictures and chat. In a 2014 interview,  CEO  John  Baku  described  the  site  as  ‘Facebook  meets  50  Shades  of  Grey’   in  McCabe, 2015: 1 , while the site’s Terms of  Use explains that ‘FetLife is a social network  for  kinksters  and  people  curious  about  exploring their sexuality’  FetLife ToU . The  site operates under a freemium model, with  most  discussion  groups  and  events  freely  available,  while  a  number  of  ‘Kinky  and  Popular’ posts  including photos, videos and  text   sit  behind  a  paywall   McCabe,  2015:  10 . As Fay and colleagues observe, FetLife  is  explicitly  not  a  dating  site,  lacking  the  usual  affordances  of  such  platforms,  but  merges  the  characteristics  of  both  dating  hook-up  platforms  and  social  networking  sites  Fay et al., 2015: 3 . It does this by pro- moting ‘sexual interaction  present in dating  websites,  absent  in  typical  social  networks  such  as  Facebook   but  in  the  presence  of  a  social  context   absent  in  dating  websites ’   Fay et al., 2015: 3 . Fay and colleagues note  that  most  FetLife  members’  social  connec- tions  are  local,  rather  than  global,  which  reflects  a  use  of  the  site  to  chat  and  keep   up-to-date  with  ‘offline’  events  and  work- shops,  allowing  them  to  ‘bootstrap  their  fetish sex life’  Fay et al., 2015: 9 .  Given that BDSM practices  and imagery   are  illegal  in  many  international  jurisdic- tions,  it  is  not  surprising  that  FetLife  not  only  permits  users  to  use  pseudonyms,  but  promotes  its  encryption  policies  and  ‘fetish  for security’ on its welcome page. The secu- rity policy has been criticized, however, with   kink  community  bloggers  reporting  signifi- cant flaws in FetLife’s code over a period of  several years  see McCabe, 2015 . The site’s  security has been severely compromised sev- eral times, including a 2014 incident in which  an  external  party  named  Mircea  Popescu  published  what  he  termed  a  ‘Meat  List’  of  ‘female-identified  FetLife  users  under  the  age  of  30’  which  included  ‘usernames,  ages, preferred BDSM roles, and number of  FetLife friends, as well as their sexual orien- tations and locations’  Massey, 2015 .  In 2015, Baku and BitLove  the Canadian  company  behind  FetLife ,  were  subjected  to  mainstream  scrutiny  by  publications  The  Daily  Dot  and  The  Atlantic  –  perhaps  sparked by the increased visibility of BDSM  via the 50 Shades franchise. While The Daily  Dot drew attention to the deficiencies in the  social  networking  site’s  code,  The  Atlantic  reported  on  ongoing  concerns  within  the  BDSM kink community regarding FetLife’s  refusal  to  allow  members  to  ‘name  and  shame’  users  who  had  sexually  assaulted  and or violated the sexual boundaries of oth- ers  see McCabe, 2015; Morris, 2015 . Those  who  supported  FetLife’s  policy  of  forbid- ding  ‘criminal  accusations  against  another  member in a public forum’ argued that if the  site’s  owners  allowed  members  to  be  pub- licly named  perhaps falsely , both Baku and  BitLove  would  be  subject  to  unreasonable  legal risks  see MacAulay Millar, 2012 .  In  contrast,  users  who  supported  naming  abusers  argued  that  FetLife’s  Terms  of  Use  allowed abusers to offend repeatedly within  the  online  and  offline  BDSM  community  without  consequence.  As  many  research- ers  and  community  members  have  noted,  the illegality of many kink practices and the  stigmatized  nature  of  BDSM  sexuality  has  built a culture in which external legal frame- works  are  distrusted   see  Stryker,  2011 .  Consequently, word-of-mouth recommenda- tions and warnings, mentoring relationships,  and  community  self-policing  have  been  preferred  practices  for  safe-guarding  con- sent  and  excluding  dangerous  or  predatory    458  community  members   Weiss,  2011 .  These  practices  previously  tended  to  be  covert  or  discreet.  Thanks  to  FetLife’s  archiving  functions,  these  discussions  are  archived  for  future  members,  provoking  significant  debate regarding the ways that the platform’s  affordances   including  the  cool  affordances  of  the  Terms  of  Use   both  reflected  and  departed from traditional ‘offline’ modes of  self-governance within kink subcultures.  conclusion  While  online  dating  sites,  like  newspaper  classified  advertising  before  them,  have  allowed for an element of geographic filter- ing of prospective partners, the geo-locative  capacity  of  contemporary  dating  and  hook- up apps facilitate a level of precision in sort- ing  that  adds  a  cartographic  dimension  to  digital sexual expression. Importantly, digital  sexual  expression  does  not  always  involve  self-representation  in  the  form  of  selfies  or  public private  sex  chat,  but  can  also  take  place within fan spaces, via the exchange of  fan fiction, or photo-shopped manips  manip- ulations   of  popular  television  or  cinematic  characters  mashed  up  with  explicit  porn  images,  and  posted  on  social  media  sites,  personal  blogs  and Tumblr  pages   Fink  and  Miller, 2013 .  As  outlined  above,  the  variety  of  modes  of  sexual  expression  afforded  by  social  media are not ‘new’ – online sex chat, net- working,  peer  support  and  erotic  and or  explicit picture exchange have been part of  digital  spaces  since  the  early  days  of  the  internet.  While  these  evolving  practices  of  sexual expression have promoted freedom of  expression  for  sexual  minorities,  they  have  also  raised  legitimate  concerns  regarding  the  costs  of  increased  visibility  for  a  range  of groups, including young people, LGBTQ  people,  and  members  of  BDSM  and  kink  subcultures. As these practices have evolved,  particularly as they become more accessible   to  young  people  aged  under  18,  they  have  provoked  regarding  the  privacy  and  security   or  lack  thereof   afforded to users.  increasing  anxiety   As  platform  developers  have  sought  to  promote  or  constrain  particular  kinds  of  sexual  expression,  however,  they  have  been  challenged by both consumer advocates call- ing for alternative modes of regulation  as in  the case of FetLife , and by ‘creative’ users  who  have  developed  workarounds  and  off- label media practices to support their sexual  cultures.  This  chapter  has  therefore  offered  a snapshot of a particular historical moment  in  the  history  of  digital  sexual  expression.  While this account of the present  and recent  past  cannot claim to predict the future, it can  suggest some possible trajectories for future  research  and  inquiry.  As  suggested  in  the  introduction, sexual expression is not neces- sarily limited to sexual exhibitionism, or the  pursuit  of  erotic  or  romantic  encounters;  it  also includes practices of identity formation  and the building of communities of care. The  ethical  concerns  raised  both  in  teen  sexting  debates and among users of FetLife intersect  with broader socio-cultural and legal conver- sations  regarding  the  intersection  between  online  and  offline  expressions  of  sexuality,  gender and power – particularly as they relate  to  questions  of  safety  and  consent  among  stigmatized populations. Social media makes  these ethical  and sometimes uncomfortable   conversations visible in new ways, and this,  I suggest, is what makes it such a productive  and intriguing space of inquiry.  references  Abidin,  C.   in  press   sexbait:  Sex  talk  on   commercial  blogs  as  informal  sexuality   education.

Yet the fact that users  are typically always connected to these pro- files means that a single oversight can lead to  drastic  consequences.  A  college  student   I  interviewed  on  this  topic  was  shocked  to  discover that her mother was, as it turned out,  her  Facebook  friend.  While  acknowledging  that she must have consciously ‘friended’ her  at some point in time, coming to terms with  this connection was a lesson in social media  visibility:  I had no idea she had Facebook first of all … And  I was like, ‘That is so creepy!’ Like, I had no idea I  had my mom as a friend and I have no idea how  long she has been creeping my Facebook! … And  it  turned  out  she’d  been  like  looking  at  my  Facebook almost every day for like five months.  While the fallout of this connection was rela- tively  benign,  this  young  user  vowed  to  be  more vigilant about her friendship ties, espe- cially  with  people  she  did  not  know.  Social  media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and   Instagram  allow  users  to  circulate  personal  information,  such  as  photographs  and  geo- locative details, as well as articulate interper- sonal  and  professional  relationships.  Individual  users  and  other  social  actors  are  perpetually coming to terms with the conse- quences of accumulating and circulating this  information.  This  chapter  presents  an  over- view of contemporary surveillance practices  that occur on social media, focusing on how  these  practices  force  a  reconsideration  of  privacy as a legal and cultural value.  I  introduce  surveillance  as  a  social  sci- entific  concept  to  underline  how  collecting,  processing  and  acting  upon  information  about  individuals  and  groups  of  individuals  is  an  organizational  logic  of  virtually  every  social sphere, including policing, marketing,  interpersonal relations and the workplace, all  of  which  are  also  present  on  social  media.  Framing  social  media  in  terms  of  surveil- lance  evinces  a  number  of  concerns  to  be  addressed.  First,  the  asynchronous  and  dis- tributed  nature  of  information  exchange  on    464  platforms  like  Facebook  results  in  forms  of  visibility that are both unverifiable and unan- ticipated. Indeed, visibility can be knowingly  harnessed as a means to harm others. Second,  the  cross-contextual  nature  of  many  plat- forms results in surveillance creep, whereby  personal  information  provided  in  one  con- text  is  repurposed  for  new  practices.  Users  rely on terms like ‘creeping’ and ‘creepy’ to  make sense of such unwanted forms of expo- sure. Recent scholarship in the area of social  media  and  surveillance  underscores  that  contemporary surveillance practices may be  participatory   Albrechtslund,  2008 ,  lateral   Andrejevic,  2005 ,  and  social   Marwick,  2012 .  These  concepts  complicate  panoptic  understandings  of  surveillance,  since  indi- viduals who were traditionally framed as the  object  of  surveillance  are  active  agents  on  social media, who may nevertheless contrib- ute to their own visibility as well as that of  other  social  actors.  Institutions  also  exploit  these platforms; individual use may mutually  augment  institutional  surveillance  and  vice  versa  Trottier, 2012 .  Both  users  and  researchers  believe  that  social media surveillance endangers privacy.  The  emergence  and  domestication  of  social  media  has  augmented  these  concerns  by  pushing  personal  information  into  the  pub- lic  eye.  However,  focusing  exclusively  on  privacy overlooks the social complexities of  social media. This chapter considers ways of  understanding  and  resisting  contemporary  surveillance that fully consider privacy, but go  beyond it. It will provide an overview of rel- evant accounts of and approaches to privacy,  including  legal  and  rights-based  interpreta- tions, performative and enacted approaches,  as  well  as  approaches  that  consider  context  and culture as key elements. These perspec- tives highlight controversies linked to the use  of social media platforms, for example when  users’  expectations  of  privacy  diverge  from  a  platform’s  technical  configuration.  In  this  chapter,  I  also  consider  scholarly  critiques  of privacy. Public discourse typically frames  privacy  as  an  individual  concern,  with  a   narrow sense of responsibility that precludes  caring  for  others   Lyon,  2001 . Attempts  to  assert  privacy  on  social  platforms  may  also  justify  surveillance  practices  against  others.  Finally, privileging privacy may come at the  expense  of  awareness  of  other  social  harms  linked  to  surveillance,  including  categorical  discrimination and a chilling effect on public  speech.  inTroducing surveillance   and visibiliTy  Surveillance,  which  implies  watching  over  others,  is  performed  by  individuals  and  organizations.  David  Lyon  defines  surveil- lance as ‘processes in which special note is  taken  of  certain  human  behaviors  that  go  well  beyond  idle  curiosity’   2007:  13 .  Surveillance  processes  can  be  broken  into  various steps: collecting personal data about  individuals,  processing  that  data,  profiling  those  individuals  or  groups  of  individuals,  and the social consequences stemming from  that  assessment.  This  distinction  is  worth  noting  due  to  temporal  and  contextual  gaps  between  these  steps.  For  example,  an  indi- vidual may write a series of tweets express- ing  her  political  views  in  the  context  of  a  controversial  election. Years  later,  they  may  be used by a potential employer to assess that  she is not a good ‘fit’  Walker, 2012 .  Surveillance  is  often  understood  through  dystopian  literature  and  movies,  such  as  George Orwell’s 1984 and Steven Spielberg’s  Minority Report. A well-known model in sur- veillance studies is the panopticon, a prison  model  by  the  19th-century  English  utilitar- ian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and made  famous  by  Michel  Foucault,  a  20th-century  French  philosopher.  In  the  panopticon,  all  prisoners can be viewed from a central tower,  whose  guards  cannot  be  seen.  Surveillance  becomes  both  all-encompassing  and  uncer- tain,  as  inmates  never  know  when  they  are  being  watched  by  prison  guards.  This    PrivaCy and surveillanCe  465  uncertainty  pushes  inmates  to  watch  over  themselves  Foucault, 1977: 221 . This self- scrutiny  is  evident  in  contemporary  soci- ety,  as  individuals  are  broadly  expected  to  watch over their own behavior. While people  are  aware  that  their  lives  are  visible  to  oth- ers,  notably  through  socializing  on  social  media, a lack of self-awareness may still lead  users to commit a social gaffe by uploading  discrediting  content  into  the  public  realm   Ronson, 2015 . Yet high-profile coverage of  these gaffes compels everyone else to be vig- ilant in their self-scrutiny. For example, when  a former vice-president at a public relations  firm was invited to FedEx’s headquarters in  Memphis to give a talk about digital media,  he issued a disparaging tweet about the city,  offending his host  and client  in the process   Andrews,  2009 .  Unknowingly,  this  social  media  expert  delivered  an  important  lesson  about  the  consequences  of  self-expression  online.  In  addition  to  Orwell  and  Foucault,  sur- veillance  studies  stems  from  the  study  of  police  practices   Marx,  1988 ,  emerging  technologies   Norris  and  Armstrong,  1999;  Lyon,  2009 ,  and  micro-level  interactions  to  manage  one’s  identity   Goffman,  1959 .  These studies support the view that surveil- lance is more than just a strategy for espio- nage  and  undercover  policing,  but  rather  a  broader  organizational  strategy  for  knowing  and  directing  a  given  population.  In  fact,  gathering personal information is a dominant  logic  for  modern  governments  and  organi- zations   Dandeker,  1990 ,  as  evidenced  in  developments  such  as  the  census  as  well  as  modern boulevards that rendered citizens and  their  movements  more  visible.  Surveillance  is  ubiquitous,  not  just  because  of  ubiqui- tous technologies, but because watching and  assessing pervades ‘virtually every enduring  social  relationship’   Rule,  2011:  64 .  Thus,  some  of  the  dimensions  that  render  social  media  ‘social’,  including  the  digitization  of  pervasive  social  relations,  are  precisely  what facilitate surveillance practices on plat- forms like Facebook. Many scholars contend   that the rise in contemporary surveillance is  partly  explained  by  large-scale  migration  to  urban centers. As individuals were no longer  rooted  in  a  fixed  setting,  people  turned  to  modes  of  verification  that  sought  to  make  up for the fleeting and unverifiable nature of  social  relations   Lyon,  2001 . When  reputa- tions become less tangible, social actors may  seek additional measures to ensure trust. This  is most apparent in login, reputation and veri- fication measures on social media platforms.  Some  users  suggest  that  Facebook  marks  a  return to a small town dynamic, in the sense  that  everyone  knows  everyone  else’s  busi- ness  Trottier, 2012 . Yet social media are a  more  enhanced  form  of  surveillance  when  compared  to  the  rural  dwelling,  as  digital  information is retained indefinitely, rendered  searchable,  and  hosted  on  platforms  like  Facebook that are unstable and ever-changing.   In other words, these social platforms are part  of  an  emerging  global  techno-commercial   infrastructure that greatly augments the capac- ity  and  persistence  of  surveillance  practices   through these platforms.  typically   Surveillance  processes   target  personal  information,  which  is  understood  as a source of revenue to corporations  CBC,  2015 , a strategic asset for security agencies   Brelsford, 2015 , and a burden for individu- als  to  manage.  Personal  information  refers  to biographical data  date of birth, national- ity , but also transactional data  recent online  purchases,  GPS  coordinates .  This  covers  a  broad  range  of  behavioral  and  attitudinal  measures  that  can  be  aggregated  and  uti- lized  far  beyond  the  context  in  which  they  first  emerge.  For  example,  insurance  com- panies  use  social  media  to  find  evidence  of  fraud   Millan,  2011   or  determine  nebulous  measures such as ‘quality of life.’ An insur- ance  company  asserted  that  a  Canadian  woman’s  presence  on  Facebook,  including  photos ‘showing her having a good time at a  Chippendales bar show, at her birthday party  and on a sun holiday’ demonstrated that she  was  not  depressed  enough  to  receive  com- pensation   CBC,  2009 .  Quality  of  life  is    466  difficult to quantify, and this ruling took place  at a time when legal systems were uncertain  about  how  much  importance  to  attribute  to  Facebook  evidence. Although  these  investi- gations were controversial, they demonstrate  that  social  media  content  is  increasingly  scrutinized,  and  that  courts  make  rulings  based  on  this  content.  Sites  like  Facebook  are  also  a  prime  source  of  information  for  divorce  lawyers   Popken,  2011 .  Here,  it  is  not the individual’s profile that is scrutinized,  but  a  combination  of  that  presence  and  the  spouse’s  access  to  their  network  of  friends.   A  broad  section  of  the  divorced  couple’s  social  life  is  made  visible  through  their  use  of social media. Visibility once reserved for  trusted peers has crept into public sphere, and  into investigative work.  Scholars  recognized  the  pervasive  and  determinant nature of the profile long before  social  media  users  were  updating  and  main- taining  theirs   Gandy,  1993 .  The  profile  is  the  principal  online  interface  between  users  and  their  social  contacts,  but  also  between  individuals  and  corporations,  governments  and other organizations. Profiles refer to any  accumulation of information of an individual  by  an  organization,  and  are  therefore  key  to  online sociality as they enable users to build  and maintain a consistent identity. Individual  profiles range from online identities on social  media, to customer profiles in loyalty card sys- tems, to medical records within a healthcare  scheme. Yet  they  may  bear  troubling  conse- quences for users who lack control over their  data or even the ability to view what an organ- ization  has  collected  about  them.  Such  pro- files are not operated by the user, but operate  on behalf of the user, who may in turn struggle  to  fix  disparities  and  cope  with  assessments  made against them on the basis of such pro- files. Likewise, vital aspects of social media  profiles  are  beyond  the  individual’s  direct  control, including tagged photos and posts on  Facebook,  negative  reviews  on  Airbnb,  and  peer recommendations on LinkedIn.  Profiles  are  a  quasi-involuntary  construc- tion  and  representation  of  the  self. Yet  the   term ‘profile’ refers to a wide range of other  ‘data doubles’  Haggerty and Ericson, 2000:  606 ,  including  racial  profiles  for  policing  and geodemographic profiles based on postal  codes  Burrows and Gane, 2006 . Upon mov- ing  to  a  specific  postal  code,  an  individual  may  be  categorized  by  a  market  research  group as a ‘newlywed or nearly dead’ or as  embracing  a  ‘shotguns  and  pickup  trucks’  lifestyle. Again, these profiles serve as stand- ins for – or simulations of  Bogard, 1996  –   the  actual  person,  and  these  simulations  have  tangible  consequences  for  individu- als. Cumulative disadvantage  Gandy, 2009   occurs when an individual is negatively pro- filed, and the consequences of this profiling  impact  life  chances,  further  reinforcing  the  negative  profile.  The  expansion  of  surveil- lance  schemes  is  fueled  by  a  ‘phenetic  fix’   Lyon,  2002 :  a  desire  by  organizations  to  classify  and  govern  aspects  of  social  life.  Surveillance  is  a  concern  not  only  because  people’s social lives are visible in ways that  are  unanticipated,  but  also  because  models,  profiles, and simulations stand in for individ- uals,  who  in  turn  endure  the  consequences.  What  remains  unclear  for  both  users  and  scholars  is  the  extent  to  which  their  social  media activity, as well as that of their peers,  feeds  into  invisible  but  determinant  catego- ries  in  any  number  of  social  contexts. As  a  result,  seemingly  inconsequential  forms  of  self-expression,  like  semi-serious  conversa- tions with friends online, feed in to a kind of  permanent – and pervasive – record.  Another  theme  that  cuts  across  surveil- lance studies is the balance between care and  control.  Surveillance  practices  are  assumed  to be a branch of social control, but many of  these practices are implemented for the sake  of ensuring a safe environment. This serves  as a reminder that not all surveillance prac- tices are received as repressive. For instance,  a cyclist may value aerial cameras that moni- tor  speeding  motorists,  who  in  turn  may  be  thankful  for  the  CCTV  cameras  in  their  parking  garage.  Likewise,  social  media  vis- ibility affords innumerable social benefits to    PrivaCy and surveillanCe  467  those  who  engage  with  these  platforms. Yet  the  semblance  of  care  is  also  used  to  jus- tify  increasingly  invasive  procedures,  and  a  greater  concern  with  personal  lives.  The  boundary  between  care  and  control  is  also  difficult  to  pinpoint,  for  example,  when  a  parent who once used a baby monitor, later  monitors their child’s mobile phone activity,  and  eventually  installs  a  tracking  device  in  their first car  Steeves and Jones, 2010 .  an emerging Typology of user- led surveillance pracTices  Surveillance on social media primarily con- cerns users’ personal data. Yet these individ- uals  themselves  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  production  and  circulation  of  this  informa- tion. Recent scholarship on this topic reveals  insights about how user information is being  repurposed through new practices and expec- tations,  and  how  users  themselves  manage  and  even  initiate  these  developments.  In  referring  to  social  surveillance,  Marwick  suggests  that  platforms  like  Facebook  and  Instagram ‘are characterized by both watch- ing and a high awareness of being watched’   2012: 379 . Social surveillance thus speaks  to relationships where those who watch over  others on social media are also rendered vis- ible  through  these  very  same  platforms.   In practice these users balance out seemingly  conflicting desires for exposure and privacy.  Unlike the relationship between an employer  and employee, social surveillance is a prod- uct  of  everyday  power  differentials,  rather  than  more  rigid  power  asymmetries.  These  dynamics  speak  to  contemporary  visibility  on  social  platforms,  and  how  in  particular  they inform interpersonal relationships.  Through social media, watching and being  watched are bundled together, as are curating  a visible and a private self. Scholars may won- der  how  these  practices  co-exist  –  and  per- haps  are  co-constructed  –  with  surveillance  practices led by states and other institutional   actors. Trottier  2012  refers to mutual aug- mentation to consider how formerly distinct  surveillance  practices  by  different  actors  in  separate  social  contexts  manifest  online.  Noting  that  many  institutional  actors  drew  from  interpersonal  experiences  and  skillsets  when using social media, Trottier argues that  various surveillance practices may now share  the same interface, information and even the  same  tactics.  By  converging  on  platforms  like  Facebook,  these  different  types  of  sur- veillance  amplify  and  enhance  each  other.  For  example,  recognizing  that  prospective  employers may access their profile, job can- didates may scan their friends’ content with  an  ‘employability’  lens,  thus  internalizing  and extending the gaze of the job interview.  Likewise, a campus security officer may turn  to a university gossip page on Facebook, tak- ing  advantage  of  the  interpersonal  scrutiny  between  students. As  social  media  are  gov- erned by a logic of connectivity that relies on  social  media  affordances  to  algorithmically  link users to other users, content, advertisers  and  platforms   Van  Dijck  and  Poell,  2013 ,  information  authored  with  one  audience  in  mind has the tendency to take on an unantici- pated afterlife, often to a completely different  audience.  Participatory  surveillance  refers  to  a  pro- cess whereby social media users knowingly  share  information  about  themselves,  and  derive  some  form  of  empowerment  from  this sharing  Albrechtslund, 2008 . This per- spective serves as an important intervention  to  scholarly  and  journalistic  accounts  that  assume that users unknowingly violate their  own privacy when uploading content to social  platforms. Indeed, users often yield specific  pleasures  and  values  from  online  sharing,  such as sharing exercise logs or calorie intake  with  an  online  fitness  community   O’Hara,  Tuffield  and  Shadbolt,  2008 .  However,  it  is  conceptually  and  practically  important  to  consider whether a user can fully consent to  share personal data, given the ever-changing   visibility  of  platforms,  along  with  other  users’ unanticipated intentions. As such risks    468  the  is   from  framework   become  embedded  in  public  awareness,  we  can  imagine  that  these  are  factored  in  as  a  kind of transaction cost associated with par- ticipatory surveillance. Another  departure   typical  through  watcher watched  theory  of  sousveillance   Mann,  Mann’s  Nolan and Wellman, 2003 . This refers to a  reversal  of  the  surveillant  gaze,  whereupon  the relatively powerless social actor watches   and typically records and transmits footage  of   the  more  powerful  actor.  Such  practices  are  linked  to  recent  political  movements,  including  Edward  Snowden  and  Chelsea  Manning’s revelations about government sur- veillance  schemes,  as  well  as  cop-watching  initiatives, the latter of which takes advantage  of social media to render police misconduct  visible.  While  mobile  devices  and  social  platforms are used in key political interven- tions,  scholars  may  question  whether  these  uses contest or confirm traditional power dif- ferentials over the long term. In the case of   cop-watching  initiatives,  consider  police  adoption  of  body-worn  cameras  that  aim  to  provide  a  more  authoritative  account  of  the  same  incidents   Brucato,  2015;  Sandhu  and  Haggerty, 2015 , as well as the fact that vis- ibility of police abuse does not readily trans- late into accountability.  individuals   Finally,  lateral  surveillance  refers  to  a  broader  cultural  condition  of  individuals  watching  other   Andrejevic,  2005 . As this concept is not limited to social  media  platforms,  it  underlines  a  broader  media culture characterized by a lack of trust  in  the  other,  coupled  with  a  savvy  subject  position  that  compels  individuals  to  bypass  their peers’ self-presentation through a series  of  techniques  and  technologies,  including  nanny  cams  and  home  drug  test  kits.  Faced  with  the  ever-present  possibility  that  a  peer  themselves  online  or   may  misrepresent  in-person,  this  media  culture  privileges  interpersonal  surveillance   and  the  knowl- edge  this  might  yield   over  what  the  peer  under scrutiny might claim, for instance, on  a blind date. A social dynamic that crosscuts   these concepts is that individuals are watch- ing  over  other  individuals,  using  the  same  technologies  and  practices  to  simultane- ously watch over themselves. This implies a  heightened  preoccupation  with  information  flows  in  almost  any  interpersonal  setting.  It  also speaks to a blurring of the boundary that  would  otherwise  distinguish  socializing  and  surveillance,  as  both  now  involve  the  asyn- chronous  overview  of  aggregated  personal  data on social platforms.  WhaT does surveillance   bring To our aTTenTion?  Approaching  social  media  practices  from  a  surveillance  studies  perspective  reveals  a  number  of  features.  First,  the  prevalence  of  information sharing speaks to a datafication  of  sociality  on  social  media  platforms.  Surveillance studies is ultimately concerned  with  the  use  and  appropriation  of  personal  information  in  a  range  of  social  contexts.  These  concerns  are  heightened  when  dis- cussing social media, where every click and  ‘like’,  alongside  thousands  of  images,  mes- sages and other user inputs, contributes to an  ever-growing  and  semi-public  record.  Even  the  absence  of  an  active  profile,  along  with  attempts  to  delete  data  and  remove  one’s  presence,  generates  digital  traces  and  thus  contributes  to  this  record. As  these  data  are  largely  contained  on  a  limited  number  of  privately owned platforms, we may consider  the latter to be a series of digital enclosures  where online activity is contained, managed  and brokered  Andrejevic, 2009 .  Users may accept surveillance practices in  some contexts, but not others. Yet the bound- ary  between  acceptable  and  unacceptable  use  is  actively  eroded.  Consider  the  notion  of ‘function creep’ and the spread of surveil- lance  practices  from  one  context  to  another   Winner, 1977; Lyon, 2007 . Seemingly intru- sive technologies typically emerge in airports,  casinos,  and  other  locations  that  can  justify     PrivaCy and surveillanCe  469  a  heightened  scrutiny  of  individuals.  This  scrutiny  is  then  normalized,  and  spreads  to  other contexts. Likewise, exceptional events  can justify the unveiling of surveillance tech- nologies. If a multinational company hires a  social  media  expert,  it  would  seem  reason- able for them to scrutinize the social media  presence  of  their  short  list  of  candidates.  However,  they  may  decide  to  extend  this  practice to all future hires. What users accept  in one context may provoke unease in slightly  different circumstances. Indeed, it comes as  no  surprise  that  early  Facebook  users  drew  upon  this  term  to  describe  the  ever-shifting  landscape  of  information  sharing   Trottier,  2012 .  The  term  ‘creep’  stands  as  a  cogent  way  of  sensing  and  expressing  surveillance  concerns.  Surveillance  studies  is  also  deeply  con- cerned  with  the  convergence  of  formerly  distinct  surveillance  regimes.  This  includes  merging  databases  and  individual  profiles,  whether  through  technological  innovation   Jenkins, 2006  or through post 9-11 legisla- tion  for example, the 2001 USA PATRIOT  Act;  Bill  C-51  in  Canada .  This  suggests  a  kind of surveillant assemblage  Haggerty and  Ericson, 2000  that leads to all-encompassing  and seemingly irrefutable profiles, by leaking  information from one context to another. The  notion  of  the  assemblage  draws  from  post- modern  contributions  to  theories  of  social  control that consider the prevalence of tem- porary connections between discrete entities,  allowing for the strategic information ‘flows’  and ‘leaks’. Although censorship still occurs  online, a generalized desire to get individu- als  to  speak  and  implicate  themselves  is  a  more  effective  strategy  for  asserting  a  par- ticular social order. This can be traced back  to the role of the ‘confession’ in the Catholic  church   Foucault,  1980 ,  but  it  extends  into  contemporary  culture  through  reality  tel- evision  tropes,  notions  of  interactivity  as  ‘empowering’,  and  social  media  interfaces  that  solicit  personal  information.  In  some  contexts, posting inflammatory content could  negatively impact someone’s life chances, if,   for instance, they are denied employment or  are  unable  to  cross  a  border.  Despite  recent  public conversations about information leaks  on  social  media,  we  may  be  compelled  to  have a presence on these sites by our peers,  the telecommunication industry and even our  employers, and the absence of one could also  lead  to  social  harms.  For  example,  in  cities  such as New York and San Francisco, land- lords have refused to provide housing for ten- ants  who  don’t  have  a  visible  social  media  presence  Morozov, 2013 .  Surveillance  in  the  context  of  social  media  underscores  how  all  interactions  on  platforms  like  Twitter  and  Instagram  are  about  the  strategic  and  often  unanticipated  exchange of personal details. Perhaps more  importantly,  the  collection  and  use  of  this  information  maintains  a  particular  social  order, including power asymmetries. In fact,  asymmetrical  visibility  feeds  into  asym- metrical  power  relations.  For  example,  the  company  behind  a  social  media  platform  may have access to data about users that the  users themselves cannot access – even if this  breaches data protection laws. On the other  hand,  those  same  users  may  possess  only  minimal knowledge about the platform and  its owners’ intentions. They might not know  how  their  information  is  being  used,  who  views  their  profile,  or  how  future  platform  redesigns will impact how they engage with  the site. If we view the relationship between  user  and  technology  companies  as  adver- sarial,  the  latter  has  a  strategic  advantage  that  stems  directly  from  this  asymmetrical  visibility.  Yet users can also harness social media vis- ibility as a kind of weapon. During the 2011  Vancouver  riot,  users  uploaded  images  and  videos of suspected rioters in real time. They  invited others to provide not only names, but  any  other  available  personal  information,  including  address,  employment,  and  schol- arships.  This  was  done  to  bring  suspects  to  the attention of the police, but also to shame  them  and  prevent  others  from  committing  similar  acts   Schneider  and  Trottier,  2013 .    470  This campaign took advantage of networked  and  distributed  sociality  to  crowd-source  a  pervasive  form  of  surveillance.  Unlike  ear- lier  forms  of  vigilantism,  these  actions  take  advantage  of  the  diffuse,  sped-up  and  far- reaching circuits of visibility on social media  platforms.  This  kind  of  response  is  becom- ing more common when it comes to identify- ing  and  shaming  suspected  child  exploiters,  terrorists, and those deemed guilty of minor  social  gaffes  such  as  bad  parking  and  poor  public  transit  etiquette   Trottier,  2014 .  Along  with  ‘doxxing’  practices   Massanari,  2015  and the ‘human flesh search engine’ in  China   Cheung,  2009 ,  these  cases  suggest  that users are harnessing networked sociality  and online visibility to gather and broadcast  information  about  targeted  individuals  as  a  type of online vigilante justice.  The  above  developments  force  a  recon- sideration  of  the  prevalence  and  relevance  of a so-called big brother in the age of social  media. Those who watch over others online  are  dispersed  in  their  social  and  political  intentions, as well as their access to various  forms  of  capital.  We  may  instead  speak  of  little brothers and sisters  Andrejevic, 2004 .  Yet little sisters do not displace big brothers.  Rather, the relation between them is mutually  augmenting.  Little  sisters  may  take  advan- tage  of  the  social  visibility  effected  by  big  brother,  such  as  using  tax  records  to  publi- cally  shame  corporations.  Likewise,  police  following  a  violent  crime  may  use  dozens  of  mobile  video  recordings  posted  by  wit- nesses on YouTube. The uneasy co-existence  of big and little siblings will remain a trou- bling  dynamic  in  the  study  of  social  media  surveillance.  While the following section addresses pri- vacy,  it  is  already  evident  that  surveillance  and  data  collection  are  concerning  for  rea- sons that extend beyond privacy. Surveillance  regimes  are  indeed  ubiquitous,  multi-con- textual,  and  increasingly  converging.  Public  exposure  is  a  concern,  yet  surveillance  also  contributes to profiling, a foreclosure of life  chances, and patterns of discrimination.  privacy and social media:   a primer  Privacy is central to both the study and per- sonal experience of surveillance. It is a legal  concern  linked  to  individual  and  collective  rights, but is also performed through every- day social interactions. In practice, individu- als have various conceptual models of privacy  which  are  balanced  against  other  priorities.  Privacy’s relevance in modern law was iden- tified by Warren and Brandeis, who defined it  as ‘the right to be let alone’  1890 , that is,  freedom from surveillance and scrutiny. Alan  Westin also shaped the contemporary under- standing of privacy in his 1967 book Privacy  and  Freedom.  Westin  describes  privacy  as  ‘the claim of individuals, groups, or institu- tions to determine for themselves when, how,  and to what extent information about them is  communicated  to  others’   1967:  337 .  This  definition  implies  a  degree  of  control  over  personal  information  flows  that  has  been  greatly complicated by social media.  While privacy is an abstract concept, it is  also a cause that is championed by activists  and policy makers  Bennett, 2008 , as well as  managed  in  everyday  contexts  by  individu- als   Nippert-Eng,  2010 .  Macro-level  advo- cacy shapes laws, policies, and best practices  through  an  international  network  of  gov- ernmental  and  non-governmental  actors.  A   micro-level  understanding  of  privacy  is  informed  by  Erving  Goffman’s  work  on  self-presentation   1959 .  His  dramaturgi- cal  approach  underscores  the  performa- tive nature of social interactions by framing  social life in terms of roles, stages and audi- ences.  Goffman  argues  individuals  are  deliberate  and  strategic  in  their  social  interactions.  This  is  partly  for  the  sake  of  cooperating with others to maintain a cohe- sive  understanding  of  the  world,  but  also  to  remain  in  good  standing  with  others.  He  distinguishes  between  front  stages,  loca- tions and contexts where social performances  occur,  and  back  stages  where  performances  are  managed.  These  regions  map  very  well   that    PrivaCy and surveillanCe  471  with a cursory understanding of ‘the public’  and ‘the private,’ and are embedded in archi- tectural  designs   for  example,  most  service  sector workplaces have a clear barrier sepa- rating front and back stages , as well as social  media  interfaces,  where  the  distinction  may  be more fluid.  The construction and performance of identity  gains salience when considering another one of  Goffman’s  sociological  contributions:  stigma   Goffman,  1963 .  Stigma  refers  to  personal  attributes that an individual wishes to hide from  others,  ranging  from  biographical  details   a  criminal record , a physical trait  a skin condi- tion , or a social quality  an inability to under- stand the rules of football . Goffman contends  that  individuals  go  to  great  measures  to  hide  stigmatizing information from public scrutiny,  and that the privacy of the back stage is para- mount for concealing these stigmas. Moreover,  stigmas  are  as  ubiquitous  as  the  technologies  and processes that risk uncovering them:  …There is only one complete unblushing male in  America:  a  young,  married,  white,  urban,  north- ern,  heterosexual  Protestant  father  of  college  education,  fully  employed,  of  good  complexion,  weight and height, and a recent record in sports.   Goffman, 1963: 128   An oft-repeated critique of privacy concerns  is that if you have nothing to hide, you have  nothing  to  fear.  Based  on  the  pervasive  nature of categorical discrimination, Goffman  stresses that social interactions are typically  a high-stakes affair.  Privacy   is  a  relevant  social  concern.   It is a legal right, and it is also a requisite for  maintaining  one’s  dignity. Yet  there  is  more  to  information  technologies  and  account- ability  than  simply  ensuring  privacy  rights.  As a starting point, consider the many ways  that  individuals  understand  privacy.  Though  some of these perspectives are more nuanced  than  others,  they  all  hold  some  degree  of  conceptual  and  empirical  purchase.  An  ini- tial approach to privacy is based on a private  public distinction. Such binaries are tangible,  conceptually elegant ways of making sense of   the social world. We can return to Goffman’s  front and back stages in order to understand  how individuals divide the social world into  ‘private’ and ‘public’. For instance, Facebook  users readily make distinctions between pri- vate  regions  like  their  inbox  and  public  regions  like  an  event  wall.  Likewise,  users  experience privacy violations when informa- tion in a private space leaks to a public one.  While this distinction is helpful for compara- tive purposes, not all private spaces are iden- tical. An initial corrective would move away  from  absolutes  like  private  and  public,  and  instead situate privacy on a continuum. Users  do make these distinctions in a comparative  sense: an inbox message on Facebook is pri- vate  compared  to  a  wall  post,  but  it  is  still  public  in  the  sense  that  it  has  been  shared  with an audience of one or more. Likewise,  a photo on an event page may be considered  public, but could be subject to further public  exposure if it were published in a newspaper. Some scholars believe that a private public  continuum fails to fully address social com- plexity,  and  instead  advocate  for  a  contex- tual  understanding  of  privacy   Nissenbaum,  2009 .  Users  may  be  comfortable  sharing  some information with a marriage counselor,  and other information with close friends. Yet  having either type of information cross over to  the other context might cause embarrassment  and harm. Users on contextually broad plat- forms like Facebook or Twitter encounter this  challenge as they struggle to find information  they  are  comfortable  sharing  with  friends,   co-workers,  family,  and  others  simultane- ously.  Multi-contextual  services  need  to  develop  privacy  settings  that  are  robust  enough  to  maintain  contextual  boundaries.  Perhaps the most important contextual viola- tion  is  the  transition  from  online  to  offline.  Individuals may still expect a boundary that  separates the two, yet this boundary is more  permeable and requires greater effort to main- tain. The now-iconic ‘on the internet, nobody  knows  you’re  a  dog’  cartoon  published  in  1993 by The New Yorker is indicative of an  antiquated understanding of privacy.   472  Another  perspective  considers  how  peo- ple may value privacy, yet compromise their  own due to competing or conflicting values.  In other words, people may choose to expose  private information for the sake of achieving  publicity. In a set of interviews on how users  come to terms with online visibility, a college  freshman likened social media to reality tel- evision and describes Facebook as: ‘our own  little form of entertainment where we can get  a glimpse of everyone’s life. … It’s like our  own little video camera following us around  and  taking  snapshots  of  our  life,  for  every- one to see.’ Not only is the public exposure of  otherwise private information seen as desir- able, but it is also a reciprocal activity among  peers. Users describe watching others in the  same  breath  as  being  watched  by  others,  to  the extent that one practice informs and jus- tifies the other. They acknowledge that they  may  regret  this  visibility  later  on  –  if  not  immediately  –  but  that  this  regret  is  offset  against  other  values  and  priorities. They  do  not necessarily want their personal informa- tion to be public, but they want social ties and  validation, and exposure via social media is  the most tangible way to obtain these things.  Other  users  may  go  public  for  the  sake  of  feeling secure. As one student user reports:  By  having  a  Facebook  profile  –  I  mean,  you’re  agreeing to have this information posted. Like, all  this  information  available  to  people.  Obviously  if  you’re  posting  it,  you  want  people  to  see  it.  Because why else would you put it up there? … It’s  almost like an insecurity thing. And it’s kind of like  a way of saying, ‘Oh, look at me. Look at my life.  Look at all the friends that I have and look at all of  the  people  that  want  to  talk  to  me’  and  I  don’t  know. I guess in that way it made me really self- conscious about Facebook.  Interpersonal security is a positive value that  pushes users to compromise their online pri- vacy. In other instances, they feel social pres- sure  from  their  peers  to  have  a  public  presence  on  social  media.  Among  the  30  young  users  interviewed,  there  was  consen- sus that they joined Facebook at the behest of  their  friends,  and  now  maintain  an  active   presence  because  of  this  social  pressure   Trottier, 2016 .  Privacy is an elusive concept, for scholars  as  well  as  social  media  users.  Users  invoke  different kinds of imagery to make sense of  their experiences and values on social media.  These  often  represent  some  blend  of  com- pliance  and  discomfort  with  social  media  visibility.  One  set  of  users  we  interviewed  initially likened their Facebook photo albums  to  real-life  photo  albums,  and  described  privacy  concerns  as  though  strangers  were  breaking into their homes to browse through  their photos. Others objected to this imagery,  treating Facebook instead as a whiteboard on  a residence door. The profile is public, fun- damentally  social,  and  meant  to  be  shared.  This  imagery  still  links  the  profile  to  the  individual’s  integrity,  as  it  is  still  subject  to  abuse.  Still  other  participants  drew  links  between  being  on  Facebook  and  being  out- doors.  This  suggests  that  users  should  have  limited expectations of secrecy, but still not  be subject to invasive or humiliating encoun- ters. Social media research often rests on the  assumption that users’ motivations to harness  social  media  are  tempered  by  privacy  con- cerns  Ellison et al., 2011 . It assumes people  deliberately seek a safe space to be sociable.  Yet  the  range  of  contexts  and  practices  that  we  observed  on  social  media  instead  sug- gest that other social values conflict with or  compromise users’ desires for privacy. Many  users  are  not  concerned  with  privacy  when  building  a  presence  on  social  media;  some  will develop an awareness of these concerns  only  if  they  experience  privacy  violations.  Yet many will be oblivious to privacy, regard- less of how private or public they regard their  information.  Users  often  recognize  that  this  may be contextual: while university students  feel  privacy  invasions  are  not  an  immediate  concern, they acknowledge that privacy will  likely be more important when they move on  to  the  next  stage  in  their  lives.  Conversely,  users  who  value  privacy  may  not  be  con- cerned with it on a per-use basis. These find- ings speak to the risk of ubiquitous, everyday    PrivaCy and surveillanCe  473  technology.  On  social  media,  even  vigilant  users may compromise their privacy simply  through continuous engagement.  social media privacy   in pracTice  Popular  discourse  often  suggests  that  social  media  and  privacy  are  incompatible,  or  at  least that continued use of these platforms is  linked  to  a  general  disavowal  of  such  con- cerns.  We  may  also  consider  a  paradoxical  distinction between a concern for privacy in  principle  and  a  willingness  in  practice  to  routinely  disclose  personal  information  online  Barnes, 2006 . Yet recent scholarship  not  only  considers  how  users  articulate  and  perform  privacy  in  the  wake  of  significant  legal,  technical  and  market-based  pressures   boyd  and  Marwick,  2011 ,  but  also  how  privacy – or lack thereof – on social media is  further  shaped  by  seemingly  contradictory  enactments on these platforms.  Users  may  first  consider  their  privacy  on  social  media  when  configuring  their  so- called privacy settings. These settings enable  the user to choose with whom they consent to  share specific types of personal information.  On  platforms  like  Facebook,  these  settings  have  expanded  in  response  to  user  outrage,  as  well  as  government  criticisms  following  an  unanticipated  and  prolonged  contextual  expansion  of  the  site   FBNewsroom,  2006,  2009 .  To  be  sure,  Facebook’s  privacy  set- tings  in  2017  are  more  granular  than  they  were  in  2007,  and  users  may  feel  over- whelmed  by  these  changes. Yet  by  navigat- ing  through  these  settings,  many  users  are  compelled  to  think  about  their  privacy  in  practice  boyd and Marwick, 2011 . In addi- tion,  some  platforms,  like  Snapchat,  are  expressly  designed  for  ephemeral  commu- nications   Poltash,  2013 ,  while  others,  like  Twitter and Instagram, are primarily framed  as  tools  for  public  expression.  Yet  even  Snapchat’s claims of ephemerality have been   compromised  by  users  intentionally  leaking  private data to the public, alongside the dis- covery that the platform itself retained photos  that were meant to be deleted  FTC, 2014 .  Note that individuals are not typically bound  a single platform, and may choose one over  the other at a particular moment on the basis  of perceived privacy affordances.  User  understandings  of  privacy  are  par- tially  shaped  through  platform  engagement,  particularly  the  default  privacy  settings   boyd  and  Hargittai,  2010 .  However,  users  adopt a variety of privacy-protective behav- iors that are independent of privacy settings.  For  example,  boyd  and  Marwick   2011   document how youngsters may conceal their  thoughts and feelings in plain sight by post- ing song lyrics. If such lyrics are familiar to  their peers, these peers will understand what  the  user  is  expressing,  while  parents  and  other  unintended  audiences  will  not  access  the  meaning  of  that  coded  message.  Other  tactics  include  relying  on  pseudonyms,  as  well  as  maintaining  multiple  accounts  that  may distinguish professional roles from per- sonal ones  Trottier, 2012 . Several platforms  and service providers, such as Facebook and  Google, have explicitly targeted these prac- tices through adopting ‘real name’ policies.  These efforts have in turn been met by protest  from communities such as transgender peo- ple and drag performers  Lingel and Golub,  2015 .  User  tactics  also  include  norms  and  expectations  in  embodied  contexts;  for  example,  the  expectation  that  house-party  attendees  will  not  be  photographed  and  tagged online.  When  mapping  the  myriad  ways  social  media  privacy  is  understood  and  enacted,  it  bears noting that these platforms are almost  entirely privately owned, which in turn con- fers a distinct set of rights and entitlements to  the platform owners. ‘Private’ in this context  pits  platform  owners’  accumulation  of  per- sonal data against users’ expectations of self- determination  in  the  outcomes  of  that  data.  While  platforms  may  retain  users’  personal  information as per their terms of service, this    474  entitlement may conflict with users’ cultural  and even legal articulations of privacy rights.  To  further  complicate  privacy  concerns,  social  media  platforms  are  frequently  con- ceived of as a public sphere, even if this ideal  is  not  actualized  in  practice   Fuchs,  2014 .  This  evokes  dilemmas  for  users  as  well  as  other  concerned  actors:  social  recognition  and self-expression are desirable values, and  are key motivations for social media users to  upload  personal  information   Shao,  2009 .  Indeed, even those who have significant pri- vacy  concerns  may  still  seek  out  a  public  presence  on  social  media.  Surveillance  and  privacy  studies  must  therefore  avoid  reduc- tionist accounts of private–public ‘tradeoffs’,  instead  focusing  on  the  complex  arrange- ment of motivations  which typically map on  to  fundamental  rights   that  govern  use  and  exposure online.  criTical engagemenTs   WiTh privacy  technologies   Privacy  holds  purchase  as  a  scholarly  con- cept  as  well  as  in  public  discourse.  Users’  experiences and concerns on social media are  relatively  novel,  and  blend  familiarity  and  unease in a manner that is typical of domes- ticated   Silverstone  and  Haddon, 1996 . Privacy has become a salient  term  to  describe  these  experiences.  Yet  approaching  social  media  visibility  exclu- sively in terms of privacy limits the scope of  a  social  scientific  analysis  and  raises  a  number  of  concerns.  To  begin,  privacy  is  typically  conceived  as  an  individual  matter,  typically  overlooking  precisely  how  the  social  dimensions  of  social  media  may  put  other  social  actors  in  harm’s  way.  User  pri- vacy often framed as an individual responsi- bility, and privacy settings for social media as  well as public recommendations by advocacy  groups  support  the  assumption  that  it  is  the  user’s responsiblity to govern their own data.  Yet control over what personal information is   knowable to what social actors is a form of  autonomy  that  is  largely  beyond  individual  control.  Scholars  should  consider  interper- sonal  dynamics  that  are  crucial  to  its  func- tioning. In particular, the idea of collaborative  identity  construction   Trottier  and  Lyon,  2011   underscores  how  social  media  inter- faces encourage users to speak on behalf of  other  users.  Through  wall  posts,  tags,  and  comments, users routinely disclose informa- tion  about  their  peers,  exposing  others  to  public  scrutiny.  Concern  for  the  self  should  extend to a concern for how others are sub- ject to exposure through our own actions.  Related  to  this  individualistic  bias  in  pri- vacy  discourse,  managing  one’s  own  pri- vacy  often  results  in  the  increased  scrutiny  of  others.  Individuals  will  understandably  take  measures  to  safeguard  their  privacy,  notably in the maintenance of private spaces  which necessitate securing boundaries, care- fully  monitoring  those  who  enter  and  exit  that  space.  Consider  the  gated  community  equipped  with  security  cameras  and  facial  recognition  software,  or  the  private  social  media platform that requires visitors to iden- tify  themselves  and  make  their  actions  vis- ible while interacting with others. Likewise,  upon finding out that their privacy could be  compromised on social media, young users I  interviewed reported that they began watch- ing over content their friends would post, tak- ing active steps to manage or sanction them   Trottier,  2012 .  These  measures  exemplify  the  internalization  of  the  surveillant  gaze   Foucault,  1977   applied  outwards  to  peers,  in the name of self-preservation.  A further limitation of privacy is that it is  too easily conceived of as a resource or com- modity, which means that those with greater  capital  or  purchasing  power  will  be  able  to  make use of privacy, while others will simply  have to cope with unwanted and unanticipated  exposure.  Privacy  thus  becomes  a  luxury  good instead of a fundamental right. In defin- ing  privacy  as  the  absence  of  embarrassing  and harmful forms of exposure, it is evident  that  detached  houses  afford  residents  more    PrivaCy and surveillanCe  475  privacy  than  apartments,  and  first-class  air- port lounges are a comparatively safer space  than a crowded concourse in which to com- mit  a  jetlag-fueled  gaffe.  On  social  media,  navigating  interfaces  and  combing  through  content requires particular sets of media lit- eracy, and also costs time, to say nothing of  hardware and services. Many users simply do  not  have  enough  of  either,  and  will  be  dis- proportionately  subject  to  invasive  scrutiny.  Public  relations  efforts  on  social  media  are  informed  by  high-profile  cases  involving  politicians,  celebrities  and  other  public  fig- ures. This arguably constitutes a normaliza- tion of strategic identity management, along  with a proliferation of online reputation man- agement  services  and  consultancies.  While  legal  debates  and  political  advocacy  focus  on establishing fundamental privacy and data  protection  rights  and  legislation,  commod- itizing  privacy  can  circumvent  a  collective  and rights-based preservation of privacy.  Finally, focusing on privacy in public dis- course  often  comes  at  the  expense  of  other  pressing  social  concerns  linked  to  surveil- lance and exposure on social media, includ- ing discrimination and social sorting. Privacy  concerns may reduce our focus to visible and  tangible artifacts, such as a user’s most recent  tweets. Such a focus overlooks the aggregate  effect that this body of information has over  10 or 20 years, as well as the myriad of ways  in which such aggregated data can be repur- posed.  If  a  user’s  social  media  presence  –  including  their  social  graph  of  connections  with others – can be used to determine their  employability   Walker,  2012 ,  or  their  eli- gibility for a bank loan  Kestler D’Amours,  2015 ,  then  it  bears  focusing  on  how  these  personal data feed into pervasive and opaque  social  categories  that  govern  individuals.  Another  concern  is  self-censorship  and  the  broader  chilling  effect  that  social  media  exposure  may  have  on  self-expression.   As  users  come  to  terms  with  the  fact  that  public and private speech on social media is  under watch, they will adjust their behavior  accordingly   Trottier,  2012 .  One  aspect  of   internalizing this gaze is that they may with- hold  content  they  would  otherwise  wish  to  share  with  their  colleagues,  out  of  fear  of  unverifiable and undesirable outcomes. At an  aggregate level, the increased unwillingness  of users to express themselves online means  that their potential for service in the public  sphere  is  further  compromised.  Finally,  the  above  concerns  point  to  fundamental  ineq- uities  when  it  comes  to  our  understanding  of social media platforms, and in particular  user understanding of how their information  is repurposed. The actions users may take to  mitigate visibility and privacy, such as delet- ing content or closing an account, may fail to  prevent these harms, especially when infor- mation  remains  on  the  platform’s  servers,  and  therefore  remains  vulnerable  to  hacks  and leaks  Thomsen, 2015 . As stated above,  asymmetry of control and of knowledge is a  primary  condition  that  informs  user  experi- ences of privacy, of visibility and of everyday  and exceptional moments of surveillance.  conclusion  This  chapter  considers  surveillance  and  pri- vacy  as  they  relate  to  social  media  and  a  broader  digital  media  landscape.  A  surveil- lance  studies  approach  locates  privacy  as  a  primary  societal  concern,  one  that  is  both  nuanced  and  paradoxical.  Addressing  this  complexity necessitates cross-disciplinary and  multi-perspective  research  that  interrogates  how  individuals  are  exposed  through  social  media,  and  the  risks  and  harms  associated  with  this  exposure.  Privacy  matters,  as  does  publicity,  autonomy,  and  the  broader  mix  of  priorities  and  values  that  motivate  users  to  build a presence  or not  on social media plat- forms. It is equally important to consider the  design  and  redesign  of  these  platforms.  The  continued  expansion,  transformation  and  acquisition of sites like Twitter and Instagram  shape  engagements  by  scholars,  users  and  policy  makers. These  changes  challenge  any  definitional  or  functional  understanding  of    476  social  media,  and  in  particular  suggest  that  user consent at one moment in time should not  extend automatically if, for instance, the plat- form’s  user  base  expands  tenfold,  or  if  it  is  repurposed as a marketing resource.  Along  with  scholarly  engagement,  pub- lic  education  and  outreach  efforts  may  be  effective to promote relevant forms of media  literacy.  Technologies  and  their  surround- ing practices are dynamic, and users are not  always  aware  of  the  consequences  of  these  changes. A lot of data schemes work by opt- out  rather  than  opt-in,  and  many  users  only  have  a  partial  understanding  of  these  agree- ments. This  speaks  to  the  weakness  of  indi- vidual  consent   Rule,  2011 ,  and  awareness  campaigns  are  a  potential  remedy  for  dense  and  largely  overlooked  privacy  statements.  Students who share these concerns may wish  to examine how social media users of varying  backgrounds envision and utilize privacy set- tings in practice, as well as how they discover  and respond to violations of their privacy and  informational  autonomy.  Likewise,  the  fact  that many users remain active on these plat- forms  for  extended  periods  means  that  the  conditions  of  visibility  that  they  embraced  at an earlier stage of their lives may provoke  discomfort  or  social  harms  at  a  latter  stage.  Students of social media and surveillance may  also  wish  to  develop  an  empirically  based  understanding of how these users respond to  such  discomfort.  Finally,  scholarly  research  should not only focus on how users are coping  with  these  developments,  but  also  re-direct  the outputs of these efforts back to users, for  example  by  addressing  the  consequences  of  technologically-mediated  transparency  to  a  broader public  see Bennett et al., 2014 .  references  Albrechtslund,  Anders.  2008.

PART V Social and Economic Domains   This page intentionally left blank   26 Social Media Marketing  M i c h a e l   S e r a z i o   a n d   B r o o k e   E r i n   D u f f y  inTroducTion  The  story  of  advertising  in  the  21st  century  might be summarized in two words: lost con- trol.  This  is,  at  least,  the  conventional,  received wisdom among industry profession- als  who  view  the  technological,  economic,  and cultural upheaval wrought by digitization  through such a narrative prism. In their reck- oning,  the  mass  media  of  the  analogue  era  offered a comparatively predictable model of  audience  habits,  platform  monitoring,  and  content output; accordingly, advertisers func- tioned as ‘top-down communicators, in con- trol of what information is released, to whom  and  when,  as  well  as  the  channels  of  com- munication themselves’  Spurgeon, 2008: 1 . Marketers’  confidence  and  sense  of  authority within this traditional model might  well  be  nostalgically  overstated:  audiences  were  never  really  that  docile;  large-scale  persuasion  never  that  assured.  Nonetheless,  this  rather  crude  framing  –  top-down  ver- sus  bottom-up  –  maps  emblematically  onto   the structural transition from mass media to  social media as the ideal means for commer- cial coaxing. Audiences, long regarded by the  industry  as  passive  recipients  for  mediated  advertising messages, are now articulated as  co-creators in a fluid, digital brand conversa- tion; what had been a one-way flow of con- tent  through  30-second  TV  spots,  full-page  glossies,  and  roadside  billboards  is  being  complemented   and,  in  some  cases,  sup- planted   by  online  initiatives  configured  for  two-way interactivity. If mass media advertis- ing had to interrupt content in order to reach  audiences,  social  media  advertising  offers  a  different approach, both philosophically and  operationally: It tries not to seem overly com- mercial and instead operates, guerrilla-style,  to  blend  seamlessly  with  social  patterns,  streams, and platforms  Serazio, 2013 .  Against  this  backdrop,  it  is  perhaps  not  surprising that marketers – more than 97 per- cent, according to a 2014 industry survey of  professionals throughout North America, the  UK,  and Australia  –  utilize  social  media  as    482  part  of  their  overall  communications  strat- egy  Stelzner, 2014 . The seismic growth in  social media expenditures is both staggering  and  telling.  Forrester  Research  pegged  US  spending at $12 billion in 2015 – an increase  from just $2 billion in 2010 and en route to  an  estimated  $27  billion  by  2020   Miglani,  2015 .  Globally,  eMarketer  projected  2015  spending would inflate to $24 billion – more  than  doubling  from  just  two  years  earlier   eMarketer,  2015 .  These  figures,  while  clearly  a  testament  to  the  sprawling  digital  media landscape, also reflect widespread dis- illusionment with more traditional techniques  of and channels for persuasion. Thus, before  examining how social media communication  is  reconfiguring  marketing  discourses  and  practices,  it  is  useful  to  take  a  look  back  at  the  recent  history  of  the  advertising-media  system.  conTexTual crises  An  appraisal  of  the  contemporary  state  of  advertising provides the necessary backstory  to  understanding  the  allure  of  social  media.  Though  admittedly  painting  the  industrial  history in broad strokes, a series of escalating  threats  to  the  traditional  advertising  model  have compelled marketers to explore alterna- tive  opportunities  to  deliver  their  messages.  Chief  among  these  fears  and  laments  is  the  proliferation  of  ad-skipping  technologies.  From  1980s-era  worries  over  the  VCR  and  remote  control  to  more  recent  anxiety  directed at spam filters, DVR recordings, and  ‘Do  Not  Call’  registries,  these  tactics  of  avoidance represent – to marketers, at least –   a  ‘backlash’  against  unwanted  commercial  exposure  Evans, 2012: 12 . One recent esti- mate holds that more than 200 million people  worldwide  regularly  employ  some  kind  of  ad-blocking  software  and,  given  the  pre- sumed  impatience  of  younger  Web  users,  those  rates  are  only  projected  to  increase   Block  shock,  2015 . Together,  these  forces   have  hastened  various  eulogies  about  ‘the  death of advertising’ as we know it  Rust and  Oliver, 1994 .  The pervasive sentiment that there is more  advertising than ever to evade – as consum- ers  wade  through  the  thickets  of  a  ‘mature  sign  economy’  within  advanced  capital- ist  nations  –  has  also  prompted  advertis- ers  to  rethink  traditional  communicative  approaches  Goldman and Papson, 1996: 8 .   Tallying  a  precise  figure  for  advertising  exposure  has  long  been  an  inexact  science,  with  widely  varying  definitions,  method- ologies, and contexts for assessing ‘clutter.’  One  of  the  more  extreme  –  though  often  cited – estimates from market research firm  Yankelovich  suggests  that  people  now  face  as  many  as  5,000  ads  competing  for  their  attention  on  a  daily  basis   Story,  2007 .  Critiquing  the  promotional  overload  that  seems  to  define  contemporary  environ- ments, cultural critic James Twitchell  1996:  56  contends, ‘Almost every physical object  now carries advertising, almost every human  environment  is  suffused  with  advertising,  almost  every  moment  of  time  is  calibrated  by  advertising.’  Naturally,  then,  the  rise  of  social media has lent itself to the latest fron- tier in this persistent ‘colonization’ of com- munication formats  McAllister, 1996 .  These  patterns  of  ad-skipping  and  com- mercial  clutter  have,  moreover,  taken  shape  amidst a fragmentation of media and society  that has meant smaller segments of the audi- ence pie for advertisers to divvy up  Turow,  1997 .  For  nearly  a  quarter-century,  adver- tisers  could  count  on  the  vast  majority  of  American homes tuning into one of just three  television networks during prime time sched- uling.  By  the  start  of  the  new  millennium,  cable  channels  had  collectively  garnered  bigger  audiences  than  the  network  share  and, a decade later, studies showed the time  that Americans spent with digital media had  surpassed  the  amount  watching  television   Delo, 2013b; Jenkins, 2006 . Such findings  mirror  the  patterns  of  audience  fragmenta- tion  in  other  geo-national  contexts,  such  as    soCial Media Marketing  483  the UK  Oliver & Ohlbaum, 2011 . If adver- tising  once  bought  and  sold  audiences  in   ‘tonnage’  bulk  –  and  if  ‘it  seemed  logical  to  use  media  vehicles  to  mass-produce  cus- tomers  in  the  same  way  that  the  factories  mass-produced  the  merchandise’  –  then  the  new conditions ushered in by Facebook and  Twitter demand a more nimble, targeted com- mercial alternative  Turow, 2005: 108–109 .   With  widespread  audience  immersion  in  these networked, co-creative media contexts,  advertising  professionals  have  adopted  the  rhetoric that ‘the age of mass advertising is  over’ and that social media might offer a nec- essary solution  Deuze, 2007b: 126 .  When  articulating  their  motivations  for  exploring social media strategies, practition- ers routinely cite all three of these conditions –   avoidance,  clutter,  and  fragmentation  –  as  part  of  a  churning  industrial  maelstrom.  It  is, however, a fourth challenge – trustworthi-  ness  –  that  makes  traditional  advertising  so  comparatively lacking and social media oppor- tunities so enticing. One recent survey reveals  that  only  four  percent  of Americans  believe   that marketers conduct themselves with integ- rity   defined  as  ‘always  keeping  promises’    Morrison, 2015 . Scholarly research has fur- ther found that consumers do not particularly  trust advertising in any of the dominant forms  of  mass  media   e.g., TV,  newspapers,  radio,  magazines, and the internet ; rather, consum- ers deploy an automatic cynicism to deal with  advertising  within  those  confines   Friestad  and Wright,  1994;  Soh  et  al.,  2007 . At  the  same  time,  a  global  study  of  trust  in  adver- tising by Nielsen, an audience measurement  company, confirmed the long-standing truism  that personal recommendations from friends  and  family  rate  the  highest  as  compared  to  professionally  created  messages   Nielsen,  2013 .  Naturally,  then,  advertisers  would  begin to turn toward settings wherein this per- sonal communication flourishes. As a writer  for Inc. magazine emblematically enthused:  Often  we  think  of  social  media  as  a  way  to  drive   traffic  to  websites,  or  build  brand  awareness  or  as   another  channel  for  marketing  communications  …  but  one  of  the  best  outcomes  with  social  media  is  how it can build trust in customers and the general  public  that  ultimately  adds  to  your  bottom  line.   Campbell, 2014, para. 3, italics added for emphasis   proTo-hisTory  Despite  the  upbeat  euphoria  over  this  seem- ingly innovative approach to promotion, social  media marketing – both theoretically and as an  industrial practice – needs to be placed within  a  timeline  that  well  predates  the  rise  of  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  Instagram.  Before  these  digital  platforms  emerged,  the  strategy  of deploying peer influence was known simply  as  ‘word-of-mouth’  or  ‘buzz’  marketing   see  Serazio, 2013, for expanded detail of this sum- mary .  An  early  incarnation  of  these  tech- niques  can  be  traced  as  far  back  as  the  First  World  War,  when  the  Committee  on  Public  Information  enlisted  opinion  leaders   ‘Four  Minute  Men’   in  communities  across  the  United States to propagandize their neighbors  to build military support  Ewen, 1996 . Such  tactics  inspired  Edward  Bernays   1928 ,  fre- quently  hailed  as  the  ‘father  of  public  rela- tions,’ to leverage the authority of third-party  intermediaries in the hope of swaying public  opinion; today, social media strategists attempt  to  achieve  much  the  same.  Though  perhaps  best known for spearheading the ‘Torches of  Freedom’  campaign,  which  exploited  the  women’s suffrage movement to position ciga- rette smoking as a conduit to gender equality,  Bernays also famously increased bacon sales  by convincing physicians to recommend it to  their  patients  under  the  guise  of  a  ‘hearty’  breakfast  Cutlip, 1994 . Similarly, beauty and  kitchenware  companies  like  Avon  and  Tupperware found success by targeting female  consumers  through  their  social  networks  –  recruiting respectable women of the commu- nity and organizing party dates to embed sales  strategies   Clarke,  1999;  Manko,  1997 .   Over  the  years,  such  schemes  also  found   their  way  into  both  political  ‘astroturfing’     484   i.e.,  implanting  grassroots  momentum   and  pop music promotion – the assumption being  that  fans  and  supporters  can  do  the  best  and  most authentic shilling on behalf of campaign- ing  candidates  and  record  labels   Serazio,  2013, 2014, 2015, 2017 . Youth, in particular,  have been pursued through these proto-social  media machinations – as seen in ‘teen peer-to- peer  marketing’   Quart,  2003 .  By  the  early  2000s,  this  industry  had  grown  fast  enough  that a Word-of-Mouth Marketing Association  could be formally chartered.  Yet  even  as  marketers  were  ‘discovering’  the utility of everyday social practices among  consumers – concomitant with the waning of  faith  in  mass  media  efficacy  –  scholars  had  long  since  established  these  patterns  as  fun- damental to understanding how interpersonal  influence flows throughout society. Word-of- mouth marketing – and, later, its social media  stepchild – exists largely because of diffusion:  the  theory  that  ideas  and  trends  spread  over  time  from  innovative  individuals  through  to  mass  adoption   Rogers,  1962 .  Moreover,  a  related ‘two-step flow’ concept holds that there  are  ‘opinion  leaders’  found  in  every  social  network  that  facilitate  the  outreach  of  those  mass  media  messages   Katz  and  Lazarsfeld,  2006  [1955] .  Such  individuals  are  imbued  with significant ‘social’ or ‘subcultural’ capi- tal, depending on the theoretical formulation   Bourdieu, 2001; Thornton, 1996 .  Marketers,  unsurprisingly,  lust  after  these  opinion  leaders  and  hope  to  draw  them  in  as  brand evangelists; one of the largest word-of- mouth  firms,  BzzAgent,  boasts  upwards  of  a  million participants across the US, Canada, and  the UK  www.bzzagent.com, 2015 . As brand  ambassadors, individuals receive free products  to  try  out,  talk  about  with  friends,  and  then  provide  feedback  to  clients  about  those  inter- actions  Balter and Butman, 2005 . One prac- titioner who has hired barflies, doormen, Little  League moms, and mass transit commuters to  show  off  such  samples  likens  the  strategy  to  ‘real life product placement’  Eisenberg, 2002 . With the rise of the internet – and the explo- sion  of  user-generated  content  enabled  by   digital  tools  –  word-of-mouth  sparked  inter- est in a ‘word-of-mouse’ equivalent  Word of  mouse, 2007 . The voracious market for ‘inter- active’ or ‘two-way’ communication emerges  at a moment when the  network – rather than  broadcasting  –  is  upheld  as  the  ‘core  organ- izing  principle  of  this  [new]  communication  environment’   Bruns,  2008:  14 .  Between  Amazon  reviews,  Facebook  updates,  and  YouTube commentary, conversations that had  been private and ephemeral are now rendered  more public and quantifiable than ever before.  Advertisers, particularly those clinging tightly  to  the  rhetoric  of  ‘lost  control,’  endeavor  to  secure  part  of  this  market  ‘share’  by  deftly  managing  social  media  communication.  But  how  do  these  professionals  strategize  and  coordinate their efforts amidst the heady brew  of  digital  options?  To  what  extent  have  they  been able to regain control of the social media  conversation? How might these practices chal- lenge  and or  reaffirm  existing  power  rela- tions, including those between producers and  consumers  of  advertising  content? And  what  are  the  socio-cultural  implications  of  these  changes  for  consumer-citizens  who  increas- ingly  live  their  lives  in  and  through   digital   media  Deuze, 2012 ?  The  following  sections  find  answers  to  these  questions  by  illustrating  the  new  holy  trinity of social marketing: earned media  i.e.,  promotion-driven  publicity ;  owned  media   i.e., content channels directly controlled by  marketers ;  and  paid  media   i.e.,  the  tradi- tional  purchase  of  ad  time  and  space . And  quite  symptomatic  of  the  emergent  logics  animating  21st-century  marketers,  ‘neither  earned  media  nor  owned  media  explicitly  involves advertising’  Turow, 2012: 133 .  social media markeTing’s   holy TriniTy  Earned Media  Within  this  much-hyped  marketing  triad,  earned  media  represents  word-of-mouth    soCial Media Marketing  485  promotion that is amplified by the networked  capability  of  digital  platforms.  Simply  put,  earned  media  signals  online  buzz:  It  is  the  one-off  YouTube  clip  that  goes  viral;  the  glowing product review posted on a blog or  Amazon;  the  auspicious  brand-centric  moment that suddenly rouses the Twitterverse.  ‘Authentic’ and ‘organic’ are frequent euphe- misms  for  earned  media;  as  one  popular  social media marketing guidebook exhorts:  The best social media marketing is always going to  be  done  by  your  fans,  not  by  you,  so  get  out  of  their way. … Motivate your fans to create content  on social networking sites for you. Organic content  is much more convincing.  Zarrella, 2010: 67, 76   the  British   Such  ‘motivat[ion]’  may  take  many  forms.   A  felicitous  earned  media  exemplar  comes  from  supermarket  chain  Sainsbury’s:  In  2011,  ‘3  ½’  year-old  Lily  Robinson  wrote  a  letter  inquiring  why  the  company’s ‘tiger bread’ was named as such,  rather  than  what  she  considered  the  much  more  apt  ‘giraffe  bread’   Stevens,  2012 .  Chris  King,  a  Sainsbury’s  customer  service  representative,  responded  to  the  toddler’s  query  with  a  letter  concurring,  ‘I  think  renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a bril- liant  idea  –  it  looks  much  more  like  the  blotches  on  a  giraffe  than  the  stripes  on  a  tiger,  doesn’t  it?’  King  included  a  £3  Sainsbury’s  gift  card  with  his  charming  response, which was signed ‘Chris King  age  27  and  1 3 .’  When  Robinson’s  mother  posted  the  letter  exchange  on  her  blog,  the  ‘giraffe  bread’  story  went  viral,  garnering  significant mainstream press coverage along  with more than 150,000 Facebook ‘likes’ and  nearly 50,000 ‘shares.’ Indeed, the response  was so profound that a representative for the  company  later  announced  it  was  officially  changing the appellation of the bread. From  a strategic planning perspective, it is difficult  to imagine that Sainsbury’s could have pre- dicted  the  extent  to  which  a  happenstance  exchange could burnish their public image.  However,  earned  media  isn’t  necessarily  unanticipated,  and  many  companies  go  to   great lengths to try to steer the online conver- sation about their brand or product. Emulating  the offline seeding practices described above,  marketers  distribute  their  wares  to  social  media influencers – the voguish term for those  with substantial clout in the digital arena  e.g.,  followers, friends, subscribers . Traditionally,  bloggers represented one of the first amateur  groups targeted by marketers, likely owing to  the platform’s ascendance prior to other social  networking sites; increasingly, though, ‘blog- ger’ activities take place across a raft of social  platforms.  Given  advertisers’  deep-rooted  assumptions about women as chiefly ‘social’  shoppers,  companies  have  been  especially  eager to curry favor with bloggers who have  cultivated a following in the fashion, beauty,  and parenting realms  Duffy, 2013b . In 2008,  relatively  early  on  in  marketers’  attempts  to  leverage  digital  influence,  consumer  goods  behemoth  Procter  &  Gamble  invited  more  than a dozen ‘mommy bloggers’ to their cor- porate headquarters for an event orchestrated  by their Pampers brand. Dispelling the claim  that the company was trying to ‘buy their loy- alty’ with this all-expenses paid trip, an exter- nal  relations  representative  explained  –  in  terms indicative of social media marketing’s  commercial  self-effacement  –  ‘We’ve  made  it  clear  that  this  is  not  really  about  pitching  products  per  se  …  but  exploring  areas  of  common interest, such as baby development  and  how  to  help  moms  in  this  topsy-turvy  time in their lives’  Neff, 2008 .  More recently, as these sorts of influencer  programs have become a central part of mar- keters’  strategies,  they  have  expanded  in  both size and scope. The fashion industry, in  particular,  has  become  notorious  for  comp- ing  products  to  high-ranking  bloggers  and  Instagrammers in hopes of scoring favorable  publicity among the sartorially inclined. In her  exposé  of  the  gifting  suites  at  Sundance,  an  independent film festival held annually in Park  Springs, Utah, New York Times reporter Sheila  Marikar   2015   explained  how  fashion  blog- gers, Viners, and Instagrammers are eclipsing  traditional  celebrities  as  public  taste-makers.    486  To woo these social media personalities, some  of  whom  boast  readership  in  the  millions,  advertisers and publicists furnished them with  brand-named clothes, shoes, tech accessories,  and  even  an  all-expenses-paid  trip  to Aruba.  In exchange for the gratis, the digital influenc- ers were expected to share photos and reviews  of the Sundance swag with their social media  friends  and  followers  in  an  ‘organic’  way.  Highlighting the financial boon of this system  to  marketers,  a  public  relations  representa- tive explained, ‘We see higher conversions off  those  girls  than  we  do  with  celebrity  place- ment  that  we  might  have  paid  money  for’   ibid. .  Here,  the  rep  nods  to  an  assumption  that  underpins  the  earned  media  imperative:  persuasive communication is deemed ‘authen- tic’ precisely because it is not paid.  To be sure, discourses of authenticity have  long been at the heart of commercial strategy,  particularly  in  the  US  context.  By  the  time  Coke was famously touted as the ‘real thing’  to  American  consumers  in  the  early  1970s,  marketers  understood  the  value  of  using  authenticity-draped pitches as a response to the  consumerist desire for expressive individualism   Duffy, 2013a; Frank, 1997 . Yet ‘authenticity’  as a cultural construct seems to have taken on  a particular salience in the social media era; as  Alice Marwick  2013: 248  argues of the Web  2.0 ethos, ‘Authenticity has become an axiom  that  primarily  differentiates  user-generated  brands from each other’. Thus, the authority of  fashion bloggers and other ‘influencers’ comes  not  from  traditional  markers  of  expertise  or  prestige but, rather, from their ability to posi- tion themselves as ‘relatable’ throughout their  arsenal of social media content  Duffy, 2013b,  2013c . Yet as we discuss below, this rhetoric  of  ‘relatability’  effectively  veils  some  of  the  covert marketing strategies deployed to peddle  products – for pay.  Owned Media  If earned media is meant to connote ‘authen- ticity,’  then  an  apt  euphemism  for  owned   media  might  be  the  equally  buzzy  term  ‘engagement.’  Recall  that  owned  media  are  channels  that  are  under  marketers’  direct  control: webpages, mobile sites, and brands’  ‘official’  or  ‘verified’  social  media  destina- tions.  British  luxury  retailer  Burberry,  oft- regarded as a pioneer among prestige brands  on  the  digital  frontier,  has  been  delivering  content  through  the  company’s  Facebook  page  since  2009;  posts  include  ‘behind-the- scenes’ photo shoots, footage from catwalks,  product images, and store opening announce- ments.  Above  all,  this  kaleidoscope  of  imagery,  videos,  and  text  is  designed  to  be  ‘sharable,’ which is all the more vital consid- ering  their  Facebook  page  has  close  to   17 million followers across the globe  Swire,  2014 . The retailer’s more recent forays into  social  media  marketing  include  a  Twitter  account  dedicated  exclusively  to  customer  service inquiries, a YouTube channel that has  amassed more than 180,000 subscribers, and  an Instagram account that includes live video  footage  from  its  runway  shows.  To  further  engage  fans  in  their  owned  media  content,  Burberry maintains a micro-site, ‘The Art of  the  Trench,’  populated  by  images  of  ‘real  people’  donning  their  iconic  line  of  coats.  Created  in  2009  and  re-launched  in  2014,  this  user-generated  initiative  includes  fea- tures that allow users to filter the style of the  garment by style, color, and gender; record- ings  of  ‘up-and-coming  artists’  provide  a  soundtrack for the site.  To date, legions of companies have – like  Burberry – launched micro-sites that leverage  the content, publicity, and networked capac- ity of social media users. In the ever-popular  ‘contest’  model  for  social  media  participa- tion, corporations invite photo and video sub- missions featuring fans with branded goods.  Doritos’  ‘Crash  the  Super  Bowl  Contest’  might  be  the  most  prominent  example,  in  which  competitors  create  ads  in  the  hopes  of landing them in a television break during  the US’s most widely watched sports event.  Initiatives such as this fit quite cozily into the  wider context of convergence culture, where    soCial Media Marketing  487  the boundaries between production and con- sumption are blurring and power is ostensibly  being  redeployed  to  the  ‘newly  empowered  consumers’  Jenkins, 2006: 19 . Though such  initiatives  are  upheld  in  the  popular  imagi- nation  as  potential  springboards  to  fame  and  creative  success,  they  have  also  been  critiqued  for  the  extent  to  which  they  rely  upon the unpaid labor of brand ambassadors   Carah, 2011; Duffy, 2010 . After all, tradi- tional media and advertising companies don’t  need to bankroll researchers, producers, and  promoters  if  self-enterprising  ‘co-creators’  are willing to do the work for free  or the oft- deterred promise of ‘exposure’   Burgess and  Green, 2009 .  In another example of using owned media  to  solicit  co-creative  content,  Cosmopolitan  targeted a young, socially connected female  audience  with  their  2010  ‘Fun,  Fearless,  Female’ user-generated campaign  see Duffy,  2013b,  for  an  overview .  A  multi-platform  promotion, the contest invited women around  the world to ‘be the star’ of a Cosmopolitan  ad campaign that was timed to coincide with  the magazine’s international expansion. The  initiative  was  announced  on  the  brand’s  YouTube  channel  with  a  video  featuring  then-editor-in-chief  Kate  White,  publisher  Donna  Kalajian  Lagani,  and  singer  Jordin  Sparks, among others. Signaling the increas- ingly global nature of the brand, ‘readers and  users  around  the  planet’  could  upload  their  photos  on  the  website,  cosmofff.com,  and  ‘see  themselves  as  part  of  the  campaign,’  Lagani  announced.  After  submitting  a  per- sonal  photo  on  the  website  –  using  either  a  Facebook  photo  or  another  digital  image  –   visitors  were  immersed  in  a  digital  simula- tion  of  a  ‘Cosmo  Photo  Studio’  and  given  virtual  ‘makeovers.’  Young  women  were  then  encouraged  to  share  their  mock  photo  shoots with their friends via Facebook, a nod  toward the growing utility of social networks  as  promotional  and  data-generating  tools.  Furthermore, the contest section of the cam- paign  required  participants  to  provide  their  names, home and email addresses – personal   information that could then be harvested by  corporate partners. As this example suggests,  the ambition in launching such initiatives is  twofold:  both  capturing  detailed  personal  information about consumer preferences and  also seeding ‘authentic’ buzz into social net- work communities.  Paid Media  ‘Paid  media’  in  the  digital  world  harkens  back  to  its  analogue  antecedents:  marketers  pay  for  time  and  space  while  taking  full  advantage  of  the  customizable,  trackable  potential  of  the  internet.  Positioning  the  unique benefits of ‘paid media’ as a mecha- nism for industrial control, a social business  strategy  executive  summarized,  ‘[Such]  ini- tiatives usually target prospects in an effort to  create  brand  awareness  or  new  customer  acquisition.  …  While  it  can  certainly  be  expensive,  you  have  complete  control  over  the  creative,  content  and  marketing’   Brito,  2013 .  To  date,  most,  if  not  all,  of  the  top  social  media  platforms  are  ad-supported,  although  their  technological  and  targeting  capacities  continue  to  evolve  in  rapid  succession.  Although  it  has  become  the  biggest  ben- eficiary of social media marketing, Facebook  appeared  initially  cautious,  preferring  to  build  up  its  user  base   and  the  enormous  sums of time spent on the site  before mone- tizing those eyeballs and hours of interaction   through  advertising  intrusion   van  Dijck,  2013 .  As  with  almost  any  form  of  adver- tising,  what  began  confined  to  the  margins   e.g.,  banners  on  the  side   has  increasingly  crept into and colonized more central spaces   e.g., sponsored updates in the ‘News Feed’  timeline    Delo,  2013a .  No  doubt  attentive  to eye-tracking research that reveals habitual  blind spots in places that advertising regularly  appears – and building upon a central thesis  here, that advertisers seek to co-opt people for  their pitches – Facebook began exploiting the  names of users’ friends in the ad content, if     488  they had ‘liked’ a particular product or brand.  Once again, the exploitation of the credibil- ity and social capital of ordinary individuals  – as though ‘micro-celebrities’ in their own  right  –  is  a  central  ambition  and  tension  in  this space  Marwick, 2013 .  Twitter played it similarly coy in its early  days,  before  expanding  the  opportunities  for  sponsored  tweets  and  promoted  trends  to interested partners; the ‘real-time’ imme- diacy of the network  and, therefore, poten- tial for on-the-fly messaging responsiveness   has been one of its most sought-after assets   Learmonth,  2013 .  The  progressive  evolu- tion of these platforms from non-commercial  to ad-subsidized has set the stage for market- ing on newer, and more spectacularly visual,  social  networks.  Pinterest,  for  instance,  has  rolled out ‘promoted pins,’ and more recently  ‘cinematic  pins,’  both  of  which  are  posi- tioned as ways to engage captive users who  may potentially ‘click through’ and purchase  the  displayed  product. The YouTube  model,  by contrast, is heavily dependent on pre-roll  advertisements, which have a historically low  viewership because of their skippable feature.  Consequently, advertisers have responded by  trying to craft slicker ads that reach people in  the  crucial,  initial  five-second  viewing  win- dow.  Geico,  in  particular,  has  been  lauded  for  creative  spots  that  ‘specifically  tailor  ads  to  pre-roll,’  an  indicator  that  marketers  are trying to work with, rather than against,  digitally  enabled  ad-avoidance  technologies   Nudd, 2015 . Here, too, ‘lost control’ – and  the adaptation to a more complicated social  media  set  of  commercial  circumstances  –  resonates with advertisers.  evaluaTing The social   media markeTing mix  Of course, as the previous discussion makes  clear, the boundaries between earned, owned,  and paid media are often quite fluid as mar- keters  attempt  to  optimize  impact  on  social   media  denizens.  In  the  ‘contest’  model  described above, for instance, both paid  i.e.,  ads  promoting  the  contest   and  owned   i.e.,  the  contest  micro-site   media  strategies  are  implemented  in  an  effort  to  mobilize  con- sumers  to  become   un under-paid   promo- tional  channels   earned  media .  As  Pepsi’s  vice  president  for  marketing  explained  of  a  social  media  contest  they  organized  solicit- ing fan photos, ‘A Pepsi brand communica- tion going from friend to friend is much more  powerful  than  brand  to  consumer’   Zmuda,  2013 .  In  other  cases,  these  pillars  of  the  social  media  marketing  mix  are  integrated  into  more  comprehensive  marketing  plans  that  also  involve  traditional  media.  Such  is  the  case  with  ‘alternate  reality  marketing’  schemes,  which,  like  The  Dark  Knight’s  ‘Why  So  Serious?’  promotion,  tend  to  be  elaborate, cross-platform, interactive, puzzle- like experiences that are frequently employed  on behalf of films and video games  Serazio,  2013: 143 .  Among  the  more  insidious  forms  of  this  blurring, and owing much to the stealth mar- keting programs of yesteryear, are paid media  initiatives  that  are  deployed  under  the  pre- tense of earned or ‘organic’ media. So-called  ‘native  advertising’  tries  to  pass  advertising  content  off  as  editorial  news  or  entertain- ment,  much  like  traditional  magazines  have  done  through  oft-disparaged   and  presum- ably  ignored   advertorials.  The  immensely  popular Buzzfeed, a so-called ‘laboratory for  viral  content’  that  draws  150  million  view- ers each month, is a prime exemplar of this   tactical  blurring:  The  start-up  boasts  a   75-person  division  that  is  ‘dedicated  to  creating  for  brands  custom  video  and  list- style  advertising  content  that  looks  similar  to  its  own  editorial  content’   Isaac,  2014 .  This  breach  of  church–state  ideals  threat- ens to leech journalistic credibility much as  Facebook  and  Twitter  have  leeched  off  our  interpersonal credibility with their efforts to  blur social and commercial content.  It  is  this  very  same  logic,  or  perhaps,  more  accurately,  surreptitiousness,  that  has    soCial Media Marketing  489  powered  the  tremendous  growth  of  paid  influencer  programs,  wherein  digital  media  personalities  receive  payment  to  puff  vari- ous  goods  among  their  social  media  audi- ences. Although regulatory bodies in several  Western  countries  now  require  bloggers  to  disclose these payment deals  as we discuss  in  a  later  section ,  the  extent  to  which  this  actually happens is unclear. So-called ‘influ- encer  marketing  programs’  have  become  so  pervasive  that  a  whole  industry  has  sprung  up to broker deals between brand marketers  and social media producers. Often, the latter  are selected, evaluated, and compensated on  the  basis  of  their  digital  metrics:  followers,  shares, views, and more – a testament to the  new  currency  that  increasingly  drives  com- mercial activity the social media age.  And,  indeed,  the  advertising  industry  as  a  whole  has  begun  to  reconsider  its  system  of  evaluation:  Rather  than  simply  judge  return-on-investment based upon how many  audiences  are  ‘reached  by’  a  given  cam- paign, firms now privilege how many people  ‘reached  out’  with  convergence  contribu- tions  including  likes,  shares,  retweets,  sub- missions,  and  comments   Serazio,  2013:  126, italics in original . Messages circulated  from  peer-to-peer   in  what  quickly  came  to  be  known  as  ‘viral’  advertising   are  held  in  greater esteem than those simply forced by a  mass media outlet onto a ‘passive’ receiver.  The  incredible  abundance  of  personal  information  that  is  available  through  social  media  channels  naturally  captivates  adver- tisers  who  have  implemented  profiling  and  targeting  practices.  Two  case  studies,  in  particular,  stand  out  as  exemplary  of  these  ambitions. In 2011, the Polish vodka brand,  Ultimat, released ‘The Social Life Audit,’ the  first-ever Facebook app that scans and rates  a  user’s  profile  and  content  across  a  dozen  dimensions,  including  ‘social  status’   pho- tos  posted  per  week ,  ‘crew  size’   number  of  people  counted  in  those  photos,  through  facial  recognition  software ,  ‘trendiness’   check-ins at popular locations , ‘nocturnal- ity’  check-ins tracked late at night , and even   ‘good times’  percentage of smiling faces in  photos   and  ‘hookup’  potential   percentage  of photos tagged with single people . The app  won  plaudits  from  Mashable  and  Creativity  magazine, with the latter acknowledging that,  ‘In  the  social  media  age,  you  are  what  you  put  on  Facebook’   Creativity  Online,  2011;  Wasserman,  2011 .  In  effect,  the  campaign  represented a branded variation on the ‘Klout  Score,’  a  social  media  analytic  standard  which  measures  the  interactivity  and  influ- ence of users across a variety of online plat- forms;  with  the  ‘Audit’  app,  Ultimat  aimed  for  opt-in  viral  circulation,  social  compari- son,  increased  partying   tips  were  given  to  improve  low  scores ,  and  affiliated  mind- share along the way.  On the other hand, Amnesty International  New  Zealand’s  ‘Trial  By  Timeline’  app  exemplified much the same means of social  media-derived  profiling  and  targeting,  but  toward  very  different  ends.  The  2013  cam- paign, which was meant to drum up a sense  of  empathy  for  and  solidarity  with  political  prisoners  and  human  rights  victims  world- wide,  developed  an  algorithm  to  similarly  scan  a  Facebook  user’s  timeline  ‘to  an  unprecedented level’ and ‘[take] note of any- thing that could be used against you,’ includ- ing likes, postings, friendships, demographic  information,  and  political  and  religious  views. It subsequently delivered a summary  of hundreds of punishments that would have  been  administered  in  countries  around  the  world where such behavior is outlawed  e.g.,  ‘stoned for drinking alcohol, imprisoned and  beaten just for talking to the opposite sex, or  hung for premarital sex’   Trial by timeline,  2014 . The campaign claimed a total reach of  15  million  people,  being  particularly  effec- tive  in  reaching  ‘key  online  influencers’  on  Twitter   e.g.,  those  sharing  results  had  an  average of more than 1,500 followers , and it  garnered the top prize that year in Facebook’s  non-profit  awards  category.  The  potential  demonstrated by these two campaigns – one  to incentivize bacchanalia, the other to cau- tion  about  the  international  consequences    490  of  it  –  show  how  much  advertisers  have  to  gain in systematically plumbing social media  data for personalized insights and attention- grabbing  content.  Whether  any  governmen- tal authorities will step in to oversee access  to  and  manipulation  of  that  data  is  another  matter.  regulaTing social media  conTenT  As  commercial  logics  make  further  inroads  into  various  aspects  of  online  life,  there  is  growing  concern  about  the  extent  to  which  advertisers  are  monitoring  and  harnessing  consumer  information  –  a  fear  pithily  sum- marized as the ‘creep factor’  Turow, 2012 .  Such  apprehension  about  marketers’  access  to  and  control  over  personal  data  has  trig- gered  backlash  from  grassroots  advocacy  groups  and  consumer  protection  agencies  alike.  In  2013,  for  instance,  thousands  of  Facebook members rallied against the social  network  through  the  ‘Say  NO  to  suggested  posts’  community  page.  Group  members  denounced Facebook’s move to better tailor  ads through the site’s ‘suggested posts’ fea- ture;  however,  participation  in  the  group  waned after a few months. More recently, in  a New York Times op-ed critiquing Facebook’s  data  monitoring  practices,  internet  scholar  Zeynep  Tufecki   2015   proposed  a  novel  economic model where users could pay a fee  to  opt  out  of  the  network’s  surveillance  activities.  Based  on  a  calculation  that  Facebook makes about 20 cents per user each  month in advertising revenue, Tufecki envi- sioned  a  micropayment  system  wherein  social  media  users  could  contribute  a  small  fee for an ad-free experience.  Government  organizations  have  a  more  formal charge to uphold the rights of citizen-  consumers  in  the  digital  age. Yet  the  veloc- ity  of  change  and  complexity  of  activities  involved  in  social  media  marketing  means  that  regulators  have  struggled  to  keep  pace    the   rapid   industry’s   with  innovations.  Questions  and  concerns  have  revolved  pri- marily  around  the  appropriate  means  of  disclosing  the  commercial  origin  of  social  media speech and the recommended protec- tions  for  consumers’  digital  data   Hayes,  2013 .  Overall,  Europe’s  system  of  regulat- ing  digital  advertising  is  considered  much  more robust than that of the US  Delo, 2012 .  European  policies  tend  to  limit  the  kind  of  information  companies  can  collect  and  use  to  deliver  hyper-targeted  social  media  mes- sages. Moreover, Europeans are more likely  than Americans  to  opt  out  of  online  behav- ioral tracking and block advertising in those  spaces  Sloane, 2015 . In the United States,  by  contrast,  marketers  are  afforded  more  leeway  to  self-regulate;  as  such,  privacy  watchdogs believe that the nation ‘has lagged  behind  other  countries  when  it  comes  to  protecting  consumer  privacy  rights’   Arbel,  2016 . In 2016, the Federal Communications  Commission  proposed  a  series  of  rules  that  would constrain the ability of internet service  providers to share customer data with adver- tisers; perhaps not surprisingly, the projected  plan  generated  significant  backlash  from  broadband networks  ibid. . Guidelines  governing   the  appropriate  means  of  disclosing  the  commercial  nature  of  social  media  messages,  such  as  the  ear- lier  mentioned  ‘native  advertising,’  also  vary by country. In the United Kingdom, the  Advertising Standards Authority  ASA , the  industry’s  self-regulatory  organization,  has  aggressively  pursued  cases  of  surreptitious  marketing. In 2014, the ASA ruled that vlog- gers must clearly disclose the paid nature of  their  relationships  with  brand  sponsors;  the  decision came in the wake of a social media  promotion  for  Oreo  cookies  that  involved  several British YouTube stars. Though some  of the social media celebs nodded toward the  company’s  involvement  with  elusive  state- ments thanking Oreo ‘for making this video  possible,’ the ASA ruled that such acknowl- edgments  were  ‘insufficient  to  make  clear  the marketing nature of the videos’  Sweney,    soCial Media Marketing  491  2014 . Two years later, the ASA banned the  Buzzfeed  listicle,  ‘14  Laundry  Fails  We’ve  All Experienced,’ which was actually a paid  advertorial  by  British  fabric  care  company  Dylon   Sweney,  2016 .  Also  in  2016,  the  Advertising  Standards  Authority  of  Ireland  announced its own set of directives for spon- sored blog content; the guidelines hold blog- gers  to  the  same  ethical  standards  as  other  forms  of  ‘media,’  in  part  by  ensuring  that  ‘consumers  know  when  they’re  receiving  marketing material’  Cullen, 2016 .  The  Federal  Trade  Commission   FTC   is  the key regulatory body responsible for over- seeing  social  media  marketing  in  the  US.  In  2013,  the  FTC  issued  a  report  stressing  that  advertising  embedded  in  online  spaces  needed to disclose itself as such ‘clearly and  conspicuously’  to  prevent  consumer  decep- tion; moreover, claims had to be truthful and  substantiated, as has been mandated – albeit,  if  not  always  upheld  –  for  offline  content   Federal  Trade  Commission,  2013:  6 .  The  updated FTC rules also required bloggers to  disclose  any  products,  services,  or  samples  they received for free. Of course, by requir- ing that a posting be identified as advertising  via  an  ad  or  sponsored  hash-tag  preface,  the  FTC  cuts  against  that  which  marketers  and  clients  value  most  about  social  media  in  the  first  place:  the  fact  that  its  messages  can avoid seeming like advertising  Serazio,  2013 . Although the FTC has only punished  a  handful  of  violators   see,  for  example,  Learmonth,  2012;  Morrison,  2014 ,  one  of  the  most  high-profile  cases  involved  luxury  department  store  Lord  & Taylor. As  part  of  a  promotion  for  their  new  spring  clothing  line, the retailer paid 50 fashion influencers  to showcase a new dress on their Instagram  feed;  however,  none  of  the  bloggers   who  reportedly  received  between  $1,000  and  $4,000  for  the  post   disclosed  their  com- pensation.  The  FTC  ruled  that  this  slickly  produced promotion was misleading to con- sumers, and Lord & Taylor subsequently got  a ‘slap on the wrist’ before a settlement was  reached  Coffee, 2016; Moran, 2016 . Other   examples  include  a  music  instruction  soft- ware  company  that  was  punished  $250,000  for paying for fake online reviews, and Sony  settled with the FTC following charges that  its advertising agency enlisted employees to  boost Twitter  buzz  about  a  new  PlayStation  device  without  disclosing  their  affiliation   Learmonth, 2012; Morrison, 2014 .  To be sure, any review of the legal oversight  of these efforts that can be offered here will  have to be temporary and certainly subject to  revision  as  new  codes  are  written   and  new  platforms  inevitably  take  shape  confound- ing  the  clarity  of  those  codes . At  the  same  time, there are certain spaces where market- ers routinely err on the side of caution, par- ticularly concerning children. Indeed, despite  the massive growth of the youth market for  social networking and gaming sites – includ- ing Moshi Monsters with its tens of millions  of members worldwide – many remained sur- prisingly ad-free, given the perceived risk of  minors’ privacy  Slutsky, 2011 .  conclusion  As this chapter has shown, the meteoric ascent  of  social  media  has  altered  the  promotional  landscape  of  the  advertising  world  in  pro- found and complex ways. Industry profession- als,  once  bound  by  the  temporal  and  spatial  constraints of analogue formats – newspaper  column inches, radio spots, and TV commer- cial  lengths  –  now  have  a  dizzying  array  of  channels through which to communicate with  potential  consumers  –  seemingly  anytime,  anywhere.  On  the  surface,  at  least,  the  staid  era of mass persuasion has been eclipsed by a  networked  era  of  individualized,  interactive  communication. And  contemporary  advertis- ers  have  swiftly  become  deft   and  insidious   experimenters as they jockey for consumers’  eyeballs  in  the  aptly  named  ‘attention  economy.’  These  changes  dovetail  with  a  new,  or  perhaps  renewed,  industry  vernacular  that    492  centers on the much-hyped ideals of authen- ticity and engagement. What underpins these  ideals is the realization that brand communi- cation is increasingly dialogical, a shift which  cannot be understood apart from the ostensi- ble  ‘democratization’  of  brands.  Beginning  in the aughts, as more media content could be  conceptualized along a scale from ‘open’ to  ‘closed’ in terms of the degree of participation  elicited from audiences  versus control main- tained  by  corporations ,  advertising  profes- sionals began to scoff at the ‘myth’ that they  ‘owned  and  orchestrated’  their  own  brands   Deuze,  2007a;  Hanna  et  al.,  2011:  266 .  And, to be sure, the social media marketing  ideal seems much more populist: It stresses  ‘grassroots’ dialogue over mass media mono- logues; hails a consumer who is ‘in charge’  of  the  brand;  and  venerates  ambitions  like  genuineness,  spontaneity,  decentralization,  and egalitarianism. Further, by taking a more  polysemic approach to the brand  in that it is  dependent on diverse interpretations fostered  in social media , marketers ostensibly relin- quish tight control of the message in favor of  hoping  to  see  a  variety  of  messages  spread  further  and,  presumably,  more  credibly.  For  these  reasons,  scholars  have  variously  theo- rized the brand as an ‘open-ended object,’ a  ‘platform for action,’ a ‘building block,’ and  a  ‘cultural  resource,’  because  ‘brands  work  by enabling consumers, by empowering them  in particular directions’  Arvidsson, 2006: 8,  68; Holt, 2002: 83; Lury, 2004: 1, 151 .  For  example,  some  of  the  activities  pro- filed in this chapter testify to such rhetorical  and  operational  openness  and  serendipity:  the letter from a  very  young consumer that  prompts a product rebranding or the sponta- neous product review from an uber-hip social  media  influencer.  In  other  cases,  though,  marketers have been able to effectively har- ness  consumer  ‘control’  and  interactivity  in  more deliberate ways. Among the best exam- ples  is  the  deployment  of  ‘real  people’  as  un- or under-paid brand ambassadors in user- generated content schemes: marketers lever- age the earned buzz of these programs while   capitalizing  on  the  laboring  activities  of   co-creators. To  critical  scholars,  these  prac- tices exploit participants in the digital labor  system  Andrejevic, 2008; Scholz 2012  and  tend  to  exacerbate  existing  industrial  hier- archies,  including  those  related  to  gender   Duffy, 2010, 2013c . Accordingly, we close  by  raising  the  possibility  that  the  infectious  rhetoric  of  ‘lost  control’  is  in  many  ways  a  convenient  myth  that  helps  to  conceal  the  extent to which traditional players still exert  their  influence.  While  the  breakneck  clip  of  social  media  technologies  continues  to  reshape  the  relationship  between  marketing  producers and consumers, the power ascribed  to the latter might perhaps be more illusory  than currently hyped.  references  Andrejevic,  M.   2008   Watching  television  without pity the productivity of online fans.

By the time of the live broadcast of the  Moon  landings,  television  had  become  the  dominant  form  of  media  for  news,  informa- tion and entertainment in the US. The TV set  was  a  fixture  in  nine  out  of  10  American  homes.  Television  was  the  defining  medium  for  the  Baby  Boomer  generation  in  the  US.  Now in their fifties and sixties, this generation  continues  to  turn  to  television  for  political  news  Mitchell, Gottfried and Matsa, 2015 .  Television  has  proved  to  be  remarkably  resilient as a source for news. In their analysis  of four years of cross-national data on news  habits,  Newman,  Levy  and  Nielsen   2015   found that significant audiences continue to  tune  in  to  the  news  on TV. The  overall  fig- ures mask generational differences that point  to  the  emergence  of  social  media  as  spaces   for news and information. People born in the  1980s  and  early  1990s  have  grown  up  with  the  internet.  For  this  millennial  generation,  research suggests that social media are what  TV was for the Baby Boomers. Six out of 10  online  millennials  in  the  US  cite  Facebook  as  their  source  for  political  news   Mitchell  et al., 2015 .  The  social  practices  that  have  developed  alongside  social  media  have  led  to  shifts  in  how publics discover and consume the news.  First is the rise of social media platforms as  spaces for the circulation of news and infor- mation. While TV and online remain as key  sources  for  news,  audiences  for  print  news- papers  dropped  off  as  the  importance  of  social  media  as  gateways  to  the  news  has  risen   Newman  et  al.,  2015 .  In  particular,  Facebook,  with  1.71  billion  monthly  active  users by June 2016, has emerged as the sig- nificant  force  in  news  discovery.  In  2010,  a  third of internet users in the US were distrib- uting  or  discussing  news  on  networks  like  Facebook   Purcell  et  al.,  2010 .  By  2015,    498  two-thirds  of  Facebook  users  across  12  countries cited the social network as a place  where they find, read, discuss or share news,  indicating ‘a quickening of the pace towards  social  media  and  mobile  news’   Newman  et al., 2015: 7 .  If  the  Moon  landing  were  taking  place  today, millions would, no doubt, be tuned into  the  live  broadcast  on  television. Alongside,  though,  people  would  be  checking  live  updates  and  feeds  on  the  web,  on  mobile  devices and on social platforms. They would  be recommending and commenting on links,  photos  and  video  on  Facebook  and  Twitter.  They  would  be  distributing,  discussing  and  dissecting news tidbits about the landings on  social  platforms,  from  Facebook  to  Twitter  and from WhatsApp to WeChat.  These  platforms,  created  as  networks  for  people to connect, communicate and create,  have  taken  on  some  of  the  functions  of  the  traditional news media, from newsgathering  to  publication.  This  chapter  examines  the  interplay between social platforms, journalis- tic norms and routines and media institutions.  It examines how the development and growth  of  social  media  platforms  have  impacted  news  flows,  before  going  on  to  consider  how  journalists  and  media  institutions  have  responded to the changing dynamics around  the discovery, selection, publication and dis- tribution of news and information.  social media and The neWs  Social  media  tools,  platforms  and  services  may be a relatively new phenomenon but it is  important to note that media have always had  a  social  element.  People  were  discussing,  commenting on and sharing news long before  Facebook, using the communication systems  available  at  the  time,  from  talking  on  the  doorstep with neighbours to sending newspa- per cuttings in the mail. In 1961, playwright  Arthur C. Miller was quoted in The Observer  newspaper as saying that ‘a good newspaper,   I  suppose,  is  a  nation  talking  to  itself’.  Donath  2004  notes that the roots of socia- ble media can be tracked back to the advent  of  letter  writing  on  clay  tablets  4,000  years  ago.  Her  definition  of  sociable  media  as  media  that  kindle  communication  and  the  formation  of  social  ties  can  be  overlaid  to  digital platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. The  growth  of  social  media  and  concur- rently social practices of sharing have led to  increased interest in the concept of ‘sharing’  in communication and media studies  Brake,  2014; Hermida, 2014; John and Sützl, 2015;  Stalder and Sützl, 2011; Sützl et al., 2012 . In  the context of social media, sharing is inextri- cably related to communication. The sharing  of news serves as a form of social currency,  with  publics  taking  advantage  of  the  com- munication tools and spaces available at the  time  to  filter,  manage  and  exchange  infor- mation,  and  in  the  process  form  and  foster  relationships. On social platforms, the act of  posting information about a matter of public  interest  or  sharing  a  link  to  a  news  story  is  an  exchange  of  cultural  and  symbolic  capi- tal that strengthens social relationships  New  York Times, n.d.; Robinson, 2011 . The con- text  for  these  exchanges  is  shaped  by  what  Rainie  and  Wellman  call  the  triple  revolu- tion: the prevalence of ‘social networks, the  personalized  internet  and  always-available  mobile connectivity’  2012: ix .  As a result, news has become a pervasive,  persistent  and  perpetual  commodity,  never  more  than  a  click  away  through  a  social  media app on a smartphone. The impact on  journalism  goes  beyond  the  enhanced  and  expanded social discovery of the news. These  spaces enable citizens to reinterpret and con- textualize messages from institutional media  organizations by adding their own comments  on a Facebook post or a specific hashtag to  frame an issue  Hinsley and Lee, 2015; Meraz  and  Papacharissi,  2013 .  Moreover,  citizens  are able to craft, circulate and consume their  own media messages  Callison and Hermida,  2015:  Papacharissi  and  de  Fatima  Oliveira,  2012 ,  taking  on  some  of  the  institutional    soCial Media and JournalisM  499  practices  of  journalists.  The  most  dramatic  and  visible  example  is  the  capacity  of  peo- ple  to  share  their  experiences  of  a  breaking  news  event.  Twitter,  alone,  has  emerged  as  a  major  channel  for  the  dissemination  of  first-hand  reports  on  major  events  from  the  2008 Chinese earthquake to the Arab Spring  in  2011   Bruno,  2011;  Hermida,  2014 . As  Marwick  and  boyd  note,  on  social  media,  ‘the  networked  audience  has  a  clear  way  to  communicate  with  the  speaker  through  the  network’  2011: 129 .  Social media, then, are a fundamental ele- ment  of  the  digital  media  environment  that  has  been  conceptualized  as  a  hybrid  space,  where  ‘the  personnel,  practices,  genres,  technologies,  and  temporalities  of  suppos- edly “new” online media are hybridized with  those  of  supposedly  “old”  broadcast  and  press media’  Chadwick, 2011: 7 . On social  media, and particularly on Twitter, news and  views from journalists, institutions and pub- lics  are  intermingled  in  incessantly  updated  and  refreshed  social  awareness  streams,  in  what  Hermida   2010   describes  as  ambi- ent  journalism.  Journalism  has  become  lit- erally  ambient  as  a  backing  track  to  daily  life,  with  news  intermingled  in  streams  of  content  generated  by  professionals  and  the  public.  For  Papacharissi,  these  are  affective  news  streams,  with  the  news  ‘collabora- tively  constructed  out  of  subjective  experi- ence, opinion, and emotion, all sustained by  and  sustaining  ambient  news  environments’   2015:  34 .  Journalists  and  media  organiza- tions contend with operating in what Callison  and Hermida  2015  describe as a contested  middle  ground,  when  the  weight  in  insti- tutional  elites  such  as  reporters  and  news  outlets  is  challenged  and  counteracted  by   the networked actions of a diverse public.  The  proliferation  of  social  media  and  the  development of social practices around the use   of  these  technologies  have  combined  to  affect  the  context  for  journalism.  Not  only  are  they  having  multifaceted  consequences  for  journalistic  norms  and  practices,  they  have also unsettled established relationships   and  hierarchies  in  the  newsroom  and  in  the  traditional  producer–consumer  relationship  between the journalist and the audience. The  result has been both opportunities and chal- lenges as traditional and novel norms, prac- tices  and  contexts  blend  in  a  hybrid  media  environment. As with earlier media technolo- gies, such as the telegraph and television, the  digital technologies of social media have had  a  significant  impact  on  what  journalists  do,  how they do it and why they do it, as well as  on the institutional frameworks in which they  have traditionally operated.  The professional adopTion   of social media  Since  the  rapid  growth  of  Facebook  and  Twitter,  social  media  have  increasingly  become  part  of  the  toolkit  of  journalists.  Industry  reports  have  tracked  the  growth  in  the  number  of  journalists  on  social  media   Cision, 2010, 2015 . A survey from the UK  suggested it has become an everyday profes- sional tool for virtually all journalists  Cision,  2013 . A study of journalists in four European  countries,  including  the  UK,  shows  similar  results   Gulyas,  2013 .  News  organizations  have created new positions for social media  editors  as  well  as  setting  up  training  pro- grammes and developing guidelines for jour- nalists  operating  in  this  area   Newman,  Dutton and Blank, 2012 .  Moreover,  media  organizations  have  sought to capitalize on the network effort by  encouraging  readers  to  share  news  stories  with their social circles. Social discovery and  recommendation  has  increasingly  become  a  significant way to reach audiences, especially  those with only a passing interest in the news   Newman  et  al.,  2015 .  Tools  encouraging  users  to  like,  share  or  recommend  a  story  have  become  commonplace   Ju,  Jeong  and  Chyi, 2014; Singer, 2014 .  While   that  social  media  have  become  everyday  in  the   figures  suggest   top-level    500  newsroom,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  that these figures can mask differences over  the degree of use. For example, Hedman and  Djerf-Pierre   2013   found  that  85  per  cent  of  Swedish  journalists  say  they  use  social  media,  but  went  on  to  highlight  that  only   one  in  10  journalists  posted  to Twitter  on  a  daily basis.  Digging  into  the  numbers  reveals  how  Twitter  developed  as  the  social  media  plat- form of choice for journalists, despite its rela- tively small user base compared to Facebook.  A 2009 headline on the American Journalism  Review  decreed  ‘The  Twitter  Explosion’  in  the  profession   Farhi,  2009 ,  while  a  report  published at the same time noted that ‘the last  few  years  have  seen  Twitter  sweep  through  newsrooms  on  the  back  of  its  convenience,  utility and immediacy’  Newman, 2009: 47 .  Media  organizations  have  encouraged  their  journalists  to  be  active  on  Twitter,  with  the  guide to social media produced by Swedish  Radio noting that the platform was ‘a strate- gic choice for spreading our material’, add- ing  that  ‘with  the  help  of  Twitter  you  can  quickly reach the “right” people’  quoted in  Hedman, 2016 .  The  appeal  of  Twitter  to  journalists  lies  in its stream of news, comments and analy- sis,  mixed  in  with  professional  and  per- sonal updates, snippets of little consequence  and  self-promotional  activities.  For  Bruns  and  Burgess,  it  is  ‘both  a  social  network- ing site and an ambient information stream’   2012:  803 .  This  conceptualization  builds  on  Hermida’s  suggestion  of  Twitter  as  ‘an  awareness  system  that  offers  diverse  means  to  collect,  communicate,  share  and  display  news  and  information,  serving  diverse  pur- poses’  2010: 301 .  Since  its  launch  in  2006,  Twitter  has  moved away from its initial prompt of ‘What  are you doing?’ to privilege event-based and  event-driven content, becoming increasingly  influential as a platform for news. In 2011, it  launched  an  official Twitter  for  Newsrooms  guide,  followed  by  best  practice  guidelines  for  journalists.  By  2015,  its  ‘About’  page   featured a stream of events happening at the  moment,  with  the  service  describing  itself  as ‘your window to the world,’ that provides  ‘real-time updates about what matters to you’   Twitter,  n.d. .  In  tracking  the  development  of Twitter, van Dijck found how the ‘subtle  but meaningful change in Twitter’s interface  indicates a strategy that emphasizes  global,  public  news and information over  personal,  private   conversation  in  restricted  circles’   2012: 340–341 .  to   Much as journalists have tended to gravi- tate  towards  Twitter,  so  have  scholars.  By  2011,  there  were  at  least  14  academic  texts  dedicated  the  platform   Pérez-Latre,  Portilla and Sánchez Blanco, 2011 . Most of  the  studies  into  how  journalists  and  media  organizations are responding to social media  have focused on Twitter  see Hermida, 2013,  for an overview . Yet, such studies may not be  representative of the practices of the majority  of journalists. Research has tended to look at  strategic  samples  based  on  the  most  active,  prominent or influential media professionals  on  Twitter   Artwick,  2013;  Lasorsa,  Lewis  and  Holton,  2012;  Noguera-Vivo,  2013;  Vis,  2013   or  have  relied  on  self-selected,  non-representative  samples   Gulyas,  2013;  Jordaan,  2013 .  While  most  journalists  talk  about using social media in their work, only  a  minority  share,  like  or  tweet  constantly  throughout  their  workday   Hedman  and  Djerf-Pierre,  2013 .  As  a  result,  there  is  a  lack  of  broad,  representative  studies  that  reflect the nuances of professional practices  in  diverse  contexts  across  the  full  range  of  social media platforms.  social media and Journalism  pracTices  The  picture  that  emerges  from  the  existing  body of literature on social media and jour- nalism  reveals  simultaneous  and  contradic- tory  processes  of  resistance  and  renewal  taking place. In line with previous changes in    soCial Media and JournalisM  501  journalism,  much  of  the  response  from  the  profession  has  been  to  resist  change  and  instead adapt new ways of working on social  media  to  fit  within  long-held,  established  practices.  Such  processes  of  normalization  have  been  evident  in  the  development  of  online news  for an overview, see Mitchelstein  and  Boczkowski,  2009 .  Similarly,  journal- ists  held  on  to  their  traditional  gatekeeping  role  during  the  emergence  of  participatory  media  technologies  such  as  blogs  or  com- ments  on  stories   Hermida  and  Thurman,  2008; Singer, 2005; Singer et al., 2011 .  With  the  arrival  of  social  media,  a  simi- lar  pattern  has  emerged.  Newsgathering  and  sourcing  routines  have  been  adapted  to  take advantage of the visibility and reach of  social  media  to  find  story  tips,  eyewitness  material  or  sources,  above  all  at  times  of  breaking news. By and large, news organiza- tions have adopted what Bruno describes as  an  ‘opportunistic’  model   2011:  66 .  It  has  become  commonplace  for  journalists  and  news organizations to scour social media and  then publish what they evaluate as newswor- thy  material  based  on  long-standing  news  values. First-hand accounts, photos and vid- eos shared on social media by people caught  up  in  major  events  such  as  a  natural  disas- ter  or  terror  attack  are  the  most  valued  by  news  organizations   Williams,  Wardle  and  Wahl-Jorgensen,  2011 .  Such  material  fills  the  news  vacuum  that  can  follow  a  major  event  until  professional  journalists  are  on   the ground.  In  what  Bruno  dubbed  as  the  ‘Twitter  effect’,  newsrooms  are  able  ‘to  provide  live  coverage  without  any  reporters  on   the  ground,  by  simply  newsgathering  user- generated content available online’  2011: 8 .   For  example,  The  Guardian,  the  BBC  and  CNN  used  extensive  social  media  from  the  audience  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of   the 2010 Haiti earthquake but stopped once  their own journalists had arrived at the scene   Bruno,  2011 .  In  their  study  of  the  BBC,  Williams,  Wardle  and  Wahl-Jorgensen  con- cluded that the public service broadcaster had   been ‘harnessing audience material in order  to  fit  within  existing  long-established  pro- cesses of journalistic production’  2011: 94 .   The notion of using social media to engage  with  audiences  in  the  co-construction  and  co-creation  of  the  news  is  a  minority  activ- ity  Cozma and Chen, 2013; Noguera-Vivo,  2013 .  One  study  on  two  South  African  newspapers epitomized that general trend in  journalism with editors largely ignoring dis- course  on  social  media  in  their  daily  news  decisions  Jordaan, 2013 . By and large, it is  journalism as usual, with journalists firmly in  charge of deciding the news.  Sourcing practices have followed the same  trajectory.  Traditionally,  journalists  have  turned to people in power as sources for infor- mation,  privileging  elites  with  institutional  authority and credibility, such as government  officials,  police  officers  or  business  lead- ers   Gans,  1979;  McNair,  1998;  Tuchman,  1972 . Moreover, journalists face operational  impediments,  such  as  proximity  of  sources,  the acceleration of news cycles and reduced  newsroom  resources   Boczkowski,  2010 ,  that  tend  to  reinforce  traditional  sourcing  practices.  A  growing  body  of  research  on  social  media  and  activism  shows  how  these  platforms  can  serve  as  channels  for  non- traditional  sources  to  rise  to  prominence   Callison  and  Hermida,  2015;  Lotan  et  al.,  2011;  Papacharissi  and  de  Fatima  Oliveira,  2012 . Such studies point to the potential of  social  media  to  expand  the  range  of  actors  involved in the construction of the news.  However, research into journalistic sourc- ing practices on social media indicates little  change  in  established  approaches.  In  their  study,  Lariscy,  Avery,  Sweetser  and  Howes   2009  found that business journalists did not  use social media as a way to find sources for  stories. As for reaching out to members of the  public,  journalists  have  tended  to  replicate  existing  practices,  except  instead  of  inter- viewing people on the street, they are taking  comments off Twitter. Tweets by members of  the public are used to capture and represent  the vox populi  Broersma and Graham, 2012;    502  Knight, 2012 . The notion of engaging with  audiences via social media is the exception,  rather than the rule. For example, in her study  of  Swedish  journalists  on  Twitter,  Hedman   2016   found  that  only  1  per  cent  made  explicit appeals to audiences.  Once the business of gathering and produc- ing the news is complete, news organizations  have  gravitated  towards  social  platforms  as  distribution  mechanisms.  They  approached  social platforms as tools to promote published  content, reach a greater audience and poten- tially  build  brand  loyalty.  Research  in  this  area  found  that  the  overwhelming  approach  of news organizations was to post a headline  with a link back to the online story  Herrera- Damas  and  Hermida,  2014;  Messner,  Linke  and  Eford,  2012 .  As  Revers  notes  in  his  study of Twitter adoption at a US newspaper,  ‘news corporations viewed Twitter as a way  to  promote  consumer  loyalty,  which  can  be  monetized’  2014: 822 .  As  with  the  early  days  of  online,  when  much of the content was print ‘shovelware’,  news  organizations  have  shifted  away  from  automated  tweets  to  crafting  posts  for  the  range of social platforms available. At times,  the process was automated so that a headline  was posted on Twitter when a story was pub- lished  online,  even  if  some  words  were  cut  off due to the 140-character limit on tweets   Blasingame,  2011 .  Overall,  though,  the  approach remains a one-way flow of informa- tion from the journalist to the audience. While  the use of social media is framed as engaging  and  connecting  with  audiences,  there  is  lit- tle in the way of an exchange of information,  responding to comments or discussing issues.  As Bullard concluded, ‘to take full advantage  of social media’s potential, news outlets must  interact with audiences beyond simply post- ing links to stories’  2015: 180 .  At  an  individual  level,  journalists  have  by  and  large  adopted  similar  approaches,  taking  advantage  of  social  media  as  chan- nels  to  promote  their  work  or  the  work  of  their organization  see, for example, Lasorsa  et al., 2012 . However, there are studies that   point  to  differences  in  approaches  based  on  news  beats.  Cozma  and  Chen   2013   found  that  foreign  correspondents  shared  mostly  news  stories,  approaching  platforms  such  as  Twitter  as  an  ersatz  wire  service.  Sports  reporters, on the other hand, seemed far more  at ease with going beyond headlines, placing  greater  emphasis  on  sharing  bits  of  opinion  and  commentary  rather  than  breaking  news   Sheffer and Schultz, 2010 .  Such  studies  suggest  that  the  norms  and  practices within specific domains of journal- ism are a factor in shaping how social media  is integrated into daily routines. Against the  backdrop of normalization of new communi- cation technologies, with journalists shaping  social  media  to  fit  within  established  ways  of working, there are indications of how the  platforms  are  shaping  journalistic  practices.  As the environment in which journalism takes  place changes, so do approaches to journal- ism. The rise of social media as a source for  breaking news, and the speed at which infor- mation  is  disseminated  has  contributed  to  a  compression of the news cycle  Bruno, 2011;  Newman, 2009 . It has become common for  journalists  to  share  snippets  of  information  on an event as it unfolds, at times providing  the first reports via social media.  Such  minute-by-minute  reporting  online  pre-dates  social  media  –  for  example,  the  Guardian  newspaper  offered  live  reports  on  soccer  matches  on  its  website  as  early  as  1999   Thurman  and  Walters,  2013 .  Since  then, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter  have  emerged  as  ready-made  spaces  for  the  transmission  of  brief  chunks  of  text,  pho- tos or video to the audience. By 2009, trade  publications were noting that ‘reporters now  routinely  tweet  from  all  kinds  of  events  –  speeches,  meetings  and  conferences,  sports  events’  Farhi, 2009: n.p. . In the same year,  Newman suggested ‘a new grammar is emerg- ing of real-time news coverage’  2009: 34 .  Twitter,  in  particular,  emerged  as  the  key  channel for journalists to distribute blow-by- blow accounts of the news. Sharing morsels  of  information  in  140  characters,  photos    soCial Media and JournalisM  503  or  video  as  events  such  as  political  rallies,  courtroom  cases  or  sporting  occasions  has  become part of news routines  Hedman and  Djerf-Pierre, 2013; Lasorsa et al., 2012 . For  example,  journalist  Brian  Stelter  described  how he was ‘trying to tweet everything I saw’  when despatched in May 2011 by The New  York Times  to  the  town  of  Joplin,  Missouri,  in order to portray the aftermath of a devas- tating  tornado   Stelter,  2011:  n.p. .  Stelter  is an example of how journalists have taken  to Twitter as a means to provide immersive,  immediate  and  impressionistic  reporting  direct to the public. In her exploratory study  of the use of Twitter by two journalists during  the London riots of 2011, Vis found that the  platform functioned as an effective reporting  tool, as well as a ‘rich source for story leads  and material’  2013: 43 . Other studies sug- gest  that  journalists  see  the  ability  to  offer  real-time updates via social media and other  platforms in a positive light, saying it allows  them to be more responsive to audience inter- ests  Thurman and Walters, 2013; Zeller and  Hermida, 2015 .  The disaggregation of the news has given  rise  to  new  digital  formats  that  curate  the  fragments of information into a more coher- ent  whole,  designed  to  tame  the  deluge  of  content on social media. Constantly updated  live  blogs  or  live  pages  have  been  adopted  by  leading  news  organizations  such  as  the  BBC  and  The  New York  Times  in  response  to breaking news events. Live pages present  information in text and audio-visual formats  in  reverse  chronological  order,  with  latest  updates first. The format ‘combines conven- tional  reporting  with  curation,  where  jour- nalists  sift  and  prioritize  information  from  secondary sources and present it to the audi- ence in close to real time, often incorporat- ing  their  feedback’   Thurman  and  Walters,  2013: 83 .  Live  pages  mark  a  shift  away  from  jour- nalism as a finished product towards journal- ism as process, capturing the confusion and  uncertainty  that  often  surrounds  breaking  news. They  echo  the  type  of  breaking  news   coverage of 24-hour TV news channels where  a  story  is  reported  as  it  unfolds.  In  contrast  to  TV  news,  readers  are  able  to  go  back  and track the twists and turns of a story. As  Guardian  journalist  Matthew  Weaver  sug- gests, ‘on a live blog you are letting the reader  in on what’s up there, and say: look, we’re let- ting you in on the process of newsgathering.  There’s a more fluid sense of what’s happen- ing’  quoted in Bruno, 2011: 44 . Journalism  as  a  practice  becomes  less  about  manufac- turing  a  definitive  rendering  of  events  and  instead a tentative and iterative process where  audiences  can  follow  how  information  is  considered, challenged and corrected in near  real-time  Hermida, 2012 .  The live pages format points to a greater  co-construction  of  the  news  by  journalists  and audiences than in legacy media formats,  as  public  material  is  routinely  integrated   into  the  stream  of  updates.  Live  pages  take  news that is happening on social media, out- side the structures of institutional news struc- tures, and reintegrate it into spaces governed  by professional norms and practices. The tra- ditional  gatekeeping  function  becomes  one  of gatewatching  Bruns, 2005 , with journal- ists  monitoring  social  media  to  select  and  amplify content considered newsworthy and  relevant.  How  far  journalists  open  up  the  editorial  process  and  involve  the  public  in  decisions  on what is newsworthy is an emerging area  of  research.  To  date,  the  most  high-profile  example of a journalist actively involving the  public in the co-construction of the news is  Andy  Carvin,  a  former  social  media  strate- gist  at  NPR   Hermida,  Lewis  and  Zamith,  2014 .  While  at  the  public  service  broad- caster,  he  covered  the  2011  uprising  in  the  Middle East through social media platforms.  For him, Twitter served as both newswire and  newsroom. On it, he shared updates, photos  and  video,  facilitated  discussions,  appealed  for  information,  and  collaborated  with  oth- ers to verify reports floating on social media.  Hermida, Lewis and Zamith argue that Carvin  functioned  as  a  central  hub  in  a  networked    504  media environment, working in a ‘distributed  and networked newsroom where knowledge  and expertise are fluid, dynamic, and hybrid’   2014: 495 .  Research to date suggests that processes of  continuity and change are taking place along- side  each  other,  with  differences  emerging  depending on the group of journalists under  scrutiny. There is little doubt that journalists  are  normalizing  social  media  platforms  to  fit within traditional practices, similar to the  adoption  of  blogs  in  journalism   Hermida,  2009;  Singer,  2005 .  But,  as  with  blogging  there is evidence of shifting practices shaped  by the logics of the new platforms. What is  still open to question is how far media pro- fessionals  who  are  changing  the  way  they  work are a sign of things to come, or whether  they  represent  outliers.  As  Hedman  posits,  perhaps  the  most  engaged  journalists  active  on Twitter ‘act as journalism’s avant-garde,  pointing  in  the  direction  of  what  journal- ism  may  become’   2016:  294,  emphasis  in  original .  To  address  this  question,  the  next  section  of  this  chapter  will  consider  how  far fundamental norms of the profession are  being impacted by social media.  social media and   Journalism norms  Social media platforms exist as spaces beyond  the  institutional  constraints  of  journalistic  enterprises. Journalists are representing their  host  news  organization  yet  publishing  their  material on third-party platforms, leading to  tensions over what have been comparatively  constant norms in journalism in Western lib- eral  democracies   Singer  et  al.,  2011;  Tuchman, 1972; Weaver, 1996 . For Lasorsa,  Lewis  and  Holton,  this  means  that  they  ‘do  not  face  the  same  level  of  oversight  nor  the  same  necessity  to  stay  on-topic  journalisti- cally’   2012:  24 .  Professional  norms  of  objectivity,  impartiality  and  accuracy  are  being bent, and to some extent subverted, in   social  media  spaces.  Singer’s  observations  that  blogging  challenges  the  notion  of  the  journalist ‘as a nonpartisan gatekeeper of infor-  mation  important  to  the  public’   2005:  74    could  have  easily  been  said  about  social  media  platforms  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter. Moreover, as she adds, a new format  ‘also  offers  journalists  the  potential  for  expanded  transparency  and  accountability’   Singer, 2005: 74 .  One area where these tensions have arisen  is  objectivity.  Admittedly,  objectivity  is  a  contested  idea  in  journalism  research.  And  professional  objectivity  need  not  necessar- ily  exclude  public  displays  of  subjectivity  by  journalists,  such  as  emotional  reactions  to  traumatic  news  events. Yet  the  notion  of  objectivity has long been held as one of the  central  tenets  in  journalism   Kovach  and  Rosenstiel,  2007;  Schudson,  2001 .  Trust  in  journalists  draws  on  the  assumption  that  they  have  kept  their  own  point  of  view  out  of their reporting and are instead offering an  impartial  and  neutral  assessment  of  events.  Professional publications go to great lengths  to  distinguish  the  spaces  for  commentary  and opinion from those for the news. Social  media  platforms  break  down  such  bounda- ries, with facts and fiction, and observations  and opinions, in the mix.  News  organizations  have  sought  to  rein- force  norms  around  objectivity  and  impar- tiality  through  training  and  social  media  guidelines. For example, The Washington Post  urged its journalists that ‘nothing we do must  call into question the impartiality of our news  judgment’   quoted  in  Hohmann,  2011:  4 .   Another  leading  US  newspaper,  The  Los  Angeles Times, warned against expressions of  partisanship, ‘just as political bumper stick- ers  and  lawn  signs  are  to  be  avoided  in  the  offline world, so too are partisan expressions  online’   quoted  in  Currie,  Bruser  and  van  Wageningen,  2011:  2 .  Despite  the  bounda- ries delineated by organizational guidelines,  individual  journalists  are  going  beyond  just  the facts on social media. A growing body of  research into what journalists do on Twitter    soCial Media and JournalisM  505  suggests  the  line  between  the  professional  and  the  personal  is  being  blurred   Hedman,  2016; Molyneux, 2014; Vis, 2013 . One anal- ysis  of  US  journalists’  tweets  from  March  2010  showed  that  nearly  43  per  cent  of  the  tweets  contained  some  degree  of  opinion,  while nearly 16 per cent were primarily opin- ions   Lasorsa  et  al.,  2012 .  The  study  also  found that 20 per cent of tweets were unre- lated to work and instead discussed personal  life. The factors related to more personal dis- closure  on  social  media  are  a  growing  area  of research. For example, female journalists  appear to be more willing to share personal  details  Hedman, 2016; Lasorsa, 2012 .  Such research highlights the dilemma for  journalists  operating  in  a  space  where  the  norms  of  behaviour  are  different  from  the  institutional  spaces  for  the  news.  On  social  media, there is an expectation to move away  from  the  traditional  voice  of  authority  that  has  marked  much  of  journalism  for  the  last  century.  As  a  space,  it  privileges  personal  expression so much so that crafting a person- ality on social media is predicated on being  ‘human’  Marwick and boyd, 2011 . Herrera  and Requejo  2012  go as far as recommend- ing  that  journalists  and  news  outlets  use  a  personal  and  human  tone.  The  reward  for  journalists  is  that  audiences  prefer  individ- ual to institutional accounts  Hermida et al.,  2012 . Those who keep their accounts strictly  professional  tend  to  have  fewer  followers   Hedman, 2016 .  Being more open has significant implica- tions for journalism. Traditionally, journalists  would have expected the public to trust them,  drawing on the contested idea of objectivity.  Just  saying,  ‘trust  me,  I’m  a  journalist’,  is  ill-suited  to  a  media  space  where  audiences  can check, criticize and condemn the media,  particularly,  if  as  Robinson   2011   posits,  journalism is increasingly about relationships  with  audiences.  Transparency,  rather  than  objectivity, then emerges as an important way  of  connecting  with  audiences  and  gaining  their trust  Hayes, Singer and Ceppos, 2007;  Plaisance, 2007 . Mapping how transparency   unfolds on social media is an underdeveloped  area of research. One study found a quarter  of  journalists  practised  some  form  of  trans- parency on Twitter, mostly engaging in dis- closure  transparency  by  talking  about  their  work and in personal transparency by sharing  morsels  about  their  lives   Hedman,  2016 .  Key  questions  going  forward  concern  how  journalists navigate the personal and profes- sional  as  transparency,  rather  than  objectiv- ity, emerges as a way to engender trust and  accountability.  Related to the notion of objectivity is veri- fication. Both norms have traditionally been  associated with a journalist’s claim to a spe- cial kind of authority and status, forming part  of  the  professional  ideology  of  journalism  in Western liberal democracies. For Kovach  and  Rosenstiel,  verification  is  ‘the  essence  of  journalism’   2007:  71 .  For  its  part,  the  Society  of  Professional  Journalists’  code  of  conduct urges journalists to ‘test the accuracy  of information from all sources and exercise  care to avoid inadvertent error’  1996 . While  speed has been an issue in journalism since  the  invention  of  the  telegram,  the  visibility,  volume  and  velocity  of  information  facili- tated by social media platforms have magni- fied the tensions over verification. Moreover,  social media weaken the gatekeeping role of  the media, as information can rapidly circu- late  beyond  the  realms  of  professional  pub- lications,  especially  during  breaking  news  events.  When  details  are  changeable,  con- fused and contradictory, reliable information  is at a premium. It is at these times that prom- inent  news  organizations  have  been  caught  out publishing incorrect information.  Some studies suggest that news organiza- tions  are  relaxing  the  rules  on  verification   Bruno, 2011; Thurman and Walters, 2013 .  Arguably, though, verification was never an  absolute,  even  before  social  media.  Rather,  the discipline of verification has been uneven  and  inconsistent,  adapted  to  suit  the  story  and  circumstances   Shapiro  et  al.,  2013 .  Getting the story right remains an ideologi- cal imperative in journalism and the cost of    506  getting  it  wrong  has  a  reputational  impact  on  news  organizations. Verification  is  being  reconfigured, rather than abandoned, through  ‘processes  of  reinforcement,  rearticula- tion,  and  reinvention’   Hermida,  2015:  41 .  Approaches  to  reinforce  verification  range  from  the  institutional  frameworks  to  elicit  and  vet  material  from  social  media,  to  out- sourcing the process, to the development of  automated tools.  At  the  same  time,  the  concept  is  being  rearticulated  through  guidelines  that  urge  journalists not to share information that hasn’t  been verified or confirmed. In practice, hold- ing off publication may not be a viable strat- egy,  as  audiences  may  already  be  aware  of  details being circulated on social media. The  reputational cost of appearing ignorant about  tweets, photos or videos surfacing on Twitter  or  Facebook  is  weighed  against  the  cost  of  publish  then  verify.  An  emerging  approach  to  resolve  these  tensions  is  the  use  of  attri- bution to separate unconfirmed details from  material that has been professionally verified   Hermida, 2015 . Labels such as ‘unverified’  or ‘unconfirmed’ signal to audiences that the  material  has  not  undergone  a  rigorous  vet- ting  process,  yet  are  a  signifier  that  a  news  organization  attaches  to  it  some  degree  of  significance.  Such  disclaimers  allow  news  organizations to expand the range of material  they publish while maintaining a professional  line of defence.  There  are  indications  that  verification  is  being  reinvented  into  what  Lewis  describes  as  a  willingness  ‘to  find  normative  purpose  in  transparency  and  participation’   2012:  851 . Journalism has traditionally been based  on  providing  an  accurate,  authenticated  and  authoritative  rendering  of  events,  with  facts  checked before publication. On social media  and emerging formats such as live pages, the  process  of  filtering  and  checking  informa- tion is more open, collaborative and iterative   Hermida et al., 2014; Thurman and Walters,  2013 . News accounts are based on the syn- thesis  of  reports,  commentary  and  perspec- tives from journalists and the public in near   real-time,  where  verification  takes  place  in  public  through  a  constantly  updated  stream  of news. Trust and authority are derived from  being transparent about the veracity or other- wise of information, and from involving the  public  in  sourcing,  filtering  and  confirming  facts  Hermida et al., 2014 .  looking ahead  Journalism norms and practices are continu- ously  impacted  by  the  societal  shifts  that  accompany the emergence of new communi- cation  technologies.  Social  media  platforms  have  not  only  affected  time-honoured  news  routines,  but  also  elicited  ambiguities  over  professional values and the nature of journal- istic identity. Most of the research into these  tensions  has  focused  on  Twitter,  as  it  has  developed  as  the  leading  platform  for  news  organizations  and  journalists   Hermida,  2013 . Yet  the  news  activities  of  journalists  and  audiences  are  not  limited  to  Twitter,  which  is  relatively  easy  to  study.  Looking  ahead, there is scope for more research into  other  social  media  platforms,  such  as  Snapchat  and  WhatsApp,  even  though  the  characteristics  of  some  platforms  present  considerable questions for scholars. In these  proprietary, closed networks, shared content  may be designed to be ephemeral or be visi- ble  only  to  a  distinct  set  of  connections.  Journalist  Alexis  Madrigal   2012   used  the  term  ‘dark  social’  to  describe  such  social  media  sharing  that  is  difficult  to  track.  In  a  sense,  these  spaces  recreate  the  fleeting  exchanges of news and information that have  long  taken  place  in  physical  social  spaces  such as cafés, bars and parks, without a per- manent record for analysis.  For  now,  much  of  the  research  on  jour- nalism and social media points to processes  of  normalization  at  play,  in  line  with  previ- ous  technologies  such  as  blogs.  But  they  also  highlight  that  the  introduction  and  use  of  social  media  have  been  a  contested  and    soCial Media and JournalisM  507  uneven process, with examples of novel and  hybrid  forms  of  news  making  that  depart  from  traditional  narrative  structures  and  diverge  from  established  norms.  The  inter- play between emerging forms of storytelling  that deviate from print-based narrative forms  and established norms and practices offers a  rich area for study.  Such research would look beyond individ- ual works of journalism and instead take into  account  storytelling  as  a  distributed  service  consumed  across  social  media  platforms  at  different  times  in  different  contexts.  First  is  investigating how journalists and news organ- izations  intervene  across  distributed  social  media  services,  raising  questions  over  how  such  activity  is  recorded,  studied  and  ana- lyzed.  Second  is  examining  how  audiences  appreciate  and  react  to  novel  forms  of  jour- nalism distributed across diverse social media  spaces  which  may  have  their  own  media  logic. For example, there are opportunities to  define, measure and analyze what is consid- ered in-depth, impactful journalism in social  media contexts where the work may be spread  across different platforms and consumed over  a  period  of  time.  Such  research  would  shed  light on whether audiences can acquire depth  over time through coming across a wide range  of content on a topic over the course of a day  or week on distributed platforms, rather than  more established notions of in-depth journal- ism related to the length of a single story.  Social  media  operate  as  a  space  outside  the  institutional  and  hierarchical  structures  of publication of journalism. Given the wide- spread popularity of these platforms, they are  the land of opportunity for both news organi- zations  and  journalists.  They  present  new  avenues  to  expand  their  reach,  engage  with  new audiences, build profile and foster brand  loyalty at both an individual and institutional  level. But the research also highlights the ten- sions for both journalists and news organiza- tions  in  operating  outside  the  framework  of  institutional journalism.  Social  media  generate  ‘a  contested  mid- dle  ground  for  relevance,  meaning  and   In   interpretation’  Callison and Hermida, 2015:  713   where  journalism  as  an  institution  is  one  element  in  a  shared  and  hybrid  media  environment. Not only are journalistic norms  and  practices  strained,  but  the  framing  and  representation of the news are challenged in  processes ‘characterized by conflict, compe- tition, partisanship, and mutual dependency,  in  the  pursuit  of  new  information  that  will  propel a news story forward and increase its  newsworthiness’  Chadwick, 2011: 19 . these  contested  environments,   the  interactions  on  social  media  can  propel  a  crowdsourced  elite  to  prominence,  together  with  the  articulation  of  a  counter-narrative  at  odds  with  mainstream  media  reporting   Callison  and  Hermida,  2015;  Papacharissi  and  Meraz,  2012 .  As  Papacharissi   2015   suggests,  ‘claims  to  agency  are  discursive,  crowdsourced  to  prominence,  networked,  and sometimes ephemeral, enabling a variety  of  actors  to  tell  stories’.  There  are  signifi- cant  questions  over  long-standing  journalis- tic sourcing practices in such circumstances  where  authority  and  influence  are  open  to  negotiation.  How  sourcing  practices  evolve  is an area for further study, as journalists go  beyond the standard approach of quote tweets  as ersatz for the vox populi.  At  an  institutional  level,  news  organiza- tions face a loss of control over the news. The  rise  of  social  discovery  and  recommenda- tion weakens the agenda-setting function of  the  media,  as  audiences  take  on  the  role  of  secondary gatekeeping  Singer, 2014 . Social  media platforms have themselves emerged as  gatekeepers, fast becoming the intermediaries  between a news organization and its potential  audience. Their value to news organizations  as  novel  distribution  channels  is  balanced  by uncertainties over loss of revenue and of  brand awareness.  Above  all,  there  are  questions  over  the  power of platforms in the filtering, selection  and promotion of news and information, with  some disquiet over how far the public service  ideals of journalism mesh with the values of  commercial companies such as Facebook or    508  Google   Ananny  and  Crawford,  2015 .  Of  particular  concern  are  automated  processes  of  news  selection  through  proprietary  algo- rithms,  with  calls  for  further  research  into  the  impact  of  algorithmic  manipulation  on  the news diet of audiences  Anderson, 2011;  Gillespie,  2014;  Tufekci,  2014 .  Research  into  the  response  of  an  industry  built  on  control of the means of production and dis- tribution of news is underdeveloped. The dis- aggregation  and  fragmentation  of  the  news  product  from  its  original  publication  opens  avenues  for  study  over  the  traditional  rela- tionship between readers and a news outlet,  with  significant  implications  for  the  institu- tional power of the media in the future.  Despite  these  tensions,  news  organiza- tions and journalists have incorporated social  media  into  what  they  do.  Platforms  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter  are  complementary  to legacy media platforms. But they are also  in competition with legacy media. And they  both  need  each  other.  News  organizations  need the audiences and social platforms need  content.  But  it  is  debatable  how  far  this  is  a  partnership  of  equals,  particularly  given  the  growth  of  technology  giants  such  as  Facebook at a time of cutbacks in the main- stream media. There is a similar trade-off for  individual  professionals.  The  opportunities  for greater audiences and a higher profile are  offset by the simple fact that they are essen- tially providing free content for social media  platforms.  While news is everywhere on social media,  that is not the primary function of these net- works. News is incidental to the daily use of  these platforms to communicate and connect.  It is important to note that legacy media still  outweigh  social  media  as  sources  for  news   Nielsen and Schrøder, 2014 . As social plat- forms  become  embedded  in  everyday  com- municative  practices,  so  too  may  everyday  news consumption. With it come implications  not only for the practice of journalism, but for  the financial models that have sustained it in  the past and for its assumed function in soci- ety in the future.  references  Ananny, M. and Crawford, K.  2015  ‘A liminal  press: Situating news app designers within a  field of networked news production’, Digital  Journalism, 3 2 : 192–208.

At one level, it makes a lot of sense to discuss  social  media  and  the  cultural  and  creative  industries  CCIs  together. The creative indus- tries  policy  discourse  emerged  in  the  late  1990s, just as the new breed of Internet com- panies  were  emerging  whose  platform  inno- vations  were  no  longer  tied  to  information  and  communication  technology   ICT   hard- ware production. The first Creative Industries  Mapping Document  Department of Culture,  Media and Sport, 1998  was published in the  UK  in  1998,  the  same  year  in  which  Larry  Page and Sergey Brin established Google as  an  incorporated  private  company.  The  pro- cesses  of  digital  disruption  that  have  been  central to the evolution of the Internet, and of  digital and social media, have also been those  that have forced innovation in the media, arts  and  entertainment  industries,  related  to   products   making  content  readily  accessible  in  digital  formats ,  processes   unbundling  traditional  production  chains  and  reorganiz- ing  the  workforce   and  services   generating  convergent media content that can be accessed  across multiple devices in ways more driven  by user preferences rather than distributional  conventions . For incumbent businesses in the  media and related industries, the challenge of  ‘born  digital’  competitors  such  as  Google,  Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and others  has  been  substantial,  and  has  undermined  traditional  models  of  revenue  generation  through  users  paying  for  content,  traditional  advertising  channels,  and  copyright  revenue  streams associated with the durability of qual- ity  content  over  time  and  restrictions  over  how it can be accessed.1  At  the  same  time,  there  has  often  been  a  surprising  lack  of  overlap  between  crea- tive  industries  debates  and  those  surround- ing  digital  and  social  media.  Despite  some  attempts  to  think  about  creative  industries  and the digital revolution in tandem – Hartley    soCial Media and the Cultural and Creative industries   513   2005   being  a  notable  example  –  the  two  fields as often as not went in separate direc- tions,  with  creative  industries  being  associ- ated   both  positively  and  negatively   with  economic  rationales  for  supporting  the  arts  and  cultural  activities,  and  digital  media  being  largely  associated  with  technological  innovation. In their overview for the National  Endowment  for  Education,  Science  and  the  Arts   NESTA   of  UK  creative  industries  policy from the 1990s to the present, Bakhshi  et al.  2013  made the point that while these  policy  documents  were  certainly  aware  of  the  transformative  impact  of  digital  tech- nologies,  few  substantive  recommendations  flowed through into actual sectoral policies.  In another overview of the period, Hewison   2014   argued  that  one  reason  for  this  was  that  the  new  generation  of  user-driven  con- tent platforms such as YouTube – what would  subsequently  be  termed  Web  2.0   O’Reilly,  2005   –  had  not  yet  come  into  existence  at  the  time  in  which  key  ideas  about  creative  industries were emerging.  But the divide between creative industries  and  digital  and  social  media  also  spoke  to  deeper  intellectual,  conceptual  and  policy  divides.  A  common  criticism  of  the  early  DCMS  reports  concerned  their  inclusion  of  the  software  industries  among  the  creative  industries,  which  critics  saw  as  artificially  inflating  the  size  and  significance  of  the  creative industries in the UK economy. In a  critique  of  creative  industries  policies  that  was  illustrative  of  these  divides,  Nicholas  Garnham  saw  attempts  to  associate  CCIs  with  digital  technologies  creative  industries  as  a  contrivance,  to  associate  cultural  poli- cies with theories of the information society   Bell, 1980  in order to ‘capture the current  prestige  of  this  theory  of  innovation  …  for  a sector and a group of workers to whom it  does not really apply’  Garnham, 2005: 22 .   Bakhshi et al. noted that policy makers con- cerned with the creative industries had little  input  into  important  changes  in  broadcast- ing  and  telecommunications  laws  in  the  UK,  despite  obvious  links  between  digital   content innovation and the quality and speed  of broadband infrastructure. Indeed, in those  sectors which came to be labeled as part of  the creative industries, the response to digital  disruption was often litigious and defensive,  seeking  stronger  copyright  laws,  and  more  vigorous  enforcement,  as  a  way  of  protect- ing  long-established  business  models  in  the  copyright-based  industries   Knopper,  2009;  Flew, 2015 .  In  considering  the  international  devel- opment  of  cultural  and  creative  industries  debates,  there  are  some  notable  features,  including: the question of whether to refer to  ‘cultural  industries’  or  ‘creative  industries’;  whether it is better to refer to a system-wide  ‘creative  economy’  than  to  the  application  of  creativity  in  defined  industries;  and  the  substantial  differences  in  related  policy  dis- courses in different parts of the world  e.g.,  the UK and Europe as compared to the US or  to China . It is also apparent that one element  of the apparent disconnect between creative  industries and digital and social media is that  the field of CCI research is often ambivalent  about  questions  of  digital  disruption,  and  associated  policy  issues.  Of  these,  the  most  significant  are  the  future  of  copyright  and  intellectual  property  laws  in  a  digital  econ- omy context, and the battles between incum- bent  media  interests  and  emergent  digital  social media platform and service providers. In  this  chapter,  I  will  consider  the  extent  to which the cultural and creative industries  benefit  from,  as  well  as  feel  threatened  by,  digital media. The chapter will begin with an  overview of the various academic and policy  debates  that  have  surrounded  the  cultural  and creative industries. This is focused upon  partly  because  it  is  a  contested  intellectual  space  –  particularly  with  regards  to  ‘arts  as  industry’ questions and how ‘culture’ is being  defined – but also because concepts like intel- lectual property have been key points of fric- tion in debates around digital media and the  creative industries. It will then discuss how,  in different contexts, social media have been  variously seen as an amplifier, a disruptor and    514  a transformer of different CCIs. The chapter  will  conclude  with  a  consideration  of  how  best to retool thinking about the cultural and  creative industries for the context of a digital  economy.  culTural and creaTive  indusTries: academic and   policy debaTes  As  was  noted  in  the  introduction,  creative  industries policies were first developed in the  United Kingdom, and it is around that experi- ence that the most detailed academic analyses   have been developed  e.g., O’Connor, 2010;  Flew,  2012;  Hewison,  2014;  Hesmondhalgh  et al., 2015 . With the election of the Labour  Government  led  by Tony  Blair  in  1997,  the  newly-created Department of Culture, Media  and  Sport   DCMS   undertook  a  mapping  exercise  of  the  size  and  significance  of  the  creative industries to the UK economy, find- ing that it had considerably greater economic  size  and  significance  than  had  previously  been assumed. Rather than seeing the arts as  publicly  subsidised  activities  bracketed  off  from  the  wider  economy  and  culture,  the  DCMS  reports  proposed  that  the  creative  industries  were  now  at  the  forefront  of  an  increasingly  post-industrial  UK  economy.  The creative industries were also at the fore- front  of  a  wider  attempt  by  Tony  Blair  and  ‘New Labour’ to promote cultural moderni- zation as part of a wider narrative associated  with the politics of the ‘Third Way’, between  free  market  capitalism  and  traditional  European social democracy.  Creative  industries  is  an  interesting  case  study in policy discourse that ran well ahead  of academic debates in the cognate fields of  arts,  media  and  cultural  policy. The  DCMS  defined  the  creative  industries  as  ‘those  activities  which  have  their  origin  in  indi- vidual  creativity,  skill  and  talent  and  which  have the potential for wealth and job creation  through  the  generation  and  exploitation  of   intellectual property’  quoted in Flew, 2013:  3–4 . In linking cultural achievement to eco- nomic performance, the DCMS followed cul- tural  policy  statements  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  such  as  Australia’s  Creative  Nation  statement,  published  in  1994,  which  pro- posed  that  ‘culture  creates  wealth  …  [and]  adds  value  [and]  makes  an  essential  contri- bution to innovation, marketing and design’,  and  is  therefore  ‘essential  to  our  economic  success’  Department of Communication and  the Arts, 1994: 7 .  In  the  early  2000s,  there  was  substantial  uptake  of  the  creative  industries  concept  internationally  Flew, 2012 , and it also gen- erated  significant  academic  debate  in  fields  such  as  media  and  cultural  studies,  as  well  as in cultural economics and cultural policy  studies   Throsby,  2010; Towse,  2010 .  MIT  scholar  Jing Wang   2008   observed  that  the  term  ‘creative  industries’  had  itself  become  an  effective  piece  of  British  global  brand  promotion, while the cultural studies scholar  Andrew  Ross  noted  that  ‘few  could  have  predicted  that  the  creative  industries  model  would  itself  become  a  successful  export’   Ross, 2007: 18 . In the extensive debate that  has  followed,  a  number  of  issues  have  con- tinued  to  arise  that  have  impacted  upon  the  uptake of the concept internationally as well  as its general policy trajectory:   	 The  question  of  why creativity  should  be  seen  as  being  primarily  located  in  those  indus- tries  defined  as  ‘creative’,  particularly  as  it  is   also  seen  as  increasingly  important  to  value- adding  through  all  sectors  of  the  economy   the  importance  of  design  to  automobiles  or  mobile  phones,  to  take  two  examples .  Andy  Pratt   2005:  33   made  the  point  that ‘it  would  be  difficult  to  identify  a  non-creative  industry  or  activity’,  while  Bilton  and  Leary   2002:  50   pointed out that ‘every industry would surely lay  claim  to  some  measure  of  individual  creativity,  skill and talent’.   	 The question of the breadth of the categories. Is  it  too  broad,  for  instance,  to  include  computer  software  and  advertising  along  with  music  and  crafts?  By  contrast,  could  it  be  too  narrow:    soCial Media and the Cultural and Creative industries   515  should tourism be included, or sport, or the librar- ies, galleries and museum sectors?   	 The  depth  with  which  the  industry  sectors  are  being  understood.  A  UNESCO   2013   study  observed  that  the  activities  of  these  industries  are  underpinned  by  significant  cultural  infra- structure,  that  includes  buildings  and  facilities,  physical  equipment,  the  archiving  and  preserv- ing  of  materials,  and  the  vital  role  played  by  educational and training institutions in preparing  people for these industries and in their ongoing  sustainability.   	 The question of whether there has been an over- emphasis upon tangible and primarily economic  measures of value, as distinct from forms of cul- tural value, including aesthetic, spiritual, histori- cal,  symbolic  and  other  forms  of  value  that  are  more intangible and difficult to quantify  Banks &   O’Connor, 2009; Throsby, 2010: 17–22 .   	 The focus on individual creativity, when many of  the industries listed clearly rely upon team-based  processes to develop complex cultural goods and  services   Caves,  2000:  85–170 ,  and  a  mislead- ing  association  of  the  creative  industries  with  romantic notions of artistic genius  Bilton, 2007 .  	 Whether  the  focus  upon  intellectual property  as a cornerstone of the creative industries was  misleading at a time when digital networks were  enabling  new  modes  of  peer-based,  collabora- tive  and  often  non-market  forms  of  produc- tion and distribution of information, knowledge  and  culture.  Authors  such  as  Lessig   2004   and  Benkler   2006   made  the  argument  that  copyright  and  intellectual  property  laws  had  decisively  moved  from  being  enablers  to  being  constraints on creative production in a digitally  networked  age,  and  a  time  when ‘the  removal  of the physical constraints on effective informa- tion production has made human creativity and  the  economics  of  information  …  core  structur- ing  facts  in  the  new  networked  information  economy’  Benkler, 2006: 4 .  Many of these debates point back to critiques  of instrumentalism in the arts, and the rela- tionship  between  cultural  and  economic  value,  that  return  to  the  roots  of  cultural  policy, and even to the Romantic critique of  the  Industrial  Revolution   Williams,  1963 .  But  the  relationship  of  CCIs  to  intellectual  property  is  a  decidedly  contemporary  one,   in   the  early  2000s,   arising in the context of dramatic transforma- tions in how information is produced, distrib- uted  and  reproduced  in  the  context  of  ICTs  and digital networks. In terms of the interna- tional uptake of cultural and creative indus- tries  policies  the  emergence of the concept was timely in that  it arose at a time when earlier debates about  ICT  policies  for  the  ‘new  economy’  were  flagging.  In  the  wake  of  the  Clinton  Administration’s  commitment  to  a  National  Information Infrastructure  NII  for the US in  1993,  and  the  subsequent  Buenos  Aires  agreement  Information  Infrastructure   GII   in  1994,  a  plethora  of  reports,  policies  and  strategies  for  informa- tion  policy  and  an  information  society  emerged  around  the  world   Henten  &  Skouby, 2006 .  for  a  Global   The  crash  of  the  NASDAQ  stock  price  index  in  2001  saw  a  resulting  deflation  of  digitally  based  ‘new  economy’  discourses,  but  this  was  matched  by  a  growing  aware- ness that investment in broadband infrastruc- ture and digital capacity was a necessary but  not sufficient condition for engagement with  new  ICT-based  industries.  In  an  influential  statement of the need to think in terms of a  creative  economy,  the  British  writer  John  Howkins distinguished between an informa- tion society ‘characterized by people spend- ing  most  of  their  time  and  making  most  of  their money by handling information, usually  by means of technology’, and a creative soci- ety  where  expanded  access  to  information  and  data  is  complemented  by  ‘the  need  to  be active, clever, and persistent in challeng- ing this information … to be original, skep- tical,  argumentative,  often  bloody-minded  and occasionally downright negative – in one  word, creative’  Howkins, 2005: 117–118 .  In  such  a  context,  creative  industries  as  a  policy  discourse  proved  to  have  consider- able capacity for policy transfer  Pratt, 2009;  Alasuutari, 2013 . The earliest uptake was in  countries  that  shared  English  language  and  or post-colonial links to the UK, most nota- bly Australia,  New  Zealand,  Singapore  and    516  Hong Kong  Flew, 2012: 42–44, 50–52 . In  the Asian  context,  creative  industries  was  a  particularly strong urban policy discourse, as  cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul,  Singapore,  Taipei,  Shanghai  and  Beijing  sought to become the leading global cities in  the fast-growing East Asian region, develop- ing place competitiveness in order to attract  global  capital  and  creative  talent.  In  this  respect,  the  ‘normative  creative  economy  script’ proved attractive to urban policy mak- ers, in cities ‘which had already established  national  broadcasting,  arts  and  cultural  industries,  but  [had]  aspirations  for  “world  city” status’  Gibson & Kong, 2005: 550 . In  some instances, most notably Singapore, ear- marked creative industries policies that were  developed  as  part  of  the  2002  Renaissance  City strategy had devolved by the late 2000s  into more sector-specific policies for the arts,  media and design  Lee, 2010; Kong, 2012 .  In  the  case  of  South  Korea,  there  was  a  massive  investment  in  the  promotion  of  Korean  cultural  products  worldwide  under  the  banner  of  Hallyu,  the  ‘Korean  Wave’,  through agencies such as the Korean Creative  Content Agency  KOCCA   J. Walsh, 2014;  Jin,  2016 .  In  Japan,  the  concept  of  ‘Gross  National  Cool’  was  embraced   Iwabuchi,  2015 , as promotion of local CCIs was com- bined with strategies to ‘rebrand’ Japan and  exercise  ‘soft  power’  globally,  and  particu- larly in the Asia-Pacific region.  Perhaps the most surprising uptake of CCI  policy discourse was in China. With the policy  objectives of reducing China’s cultural trade  imbalance  with  the  West,  developing  new  industries  in  local  and  regional  economies,  and  making  media  and  cultural  institutions  less dependent upon the state, the hybrid con- cept of cultural creative industries was taken  up strongly in China. Creative clusters such  as  Beijing’s  798  Art  Zone  and  Shanghai’s  Tianzifang  developed  as  concentrated  sites  of cultural production and arts consumption.  As  Keane   2013   has  argued,  the  concept  of  CCIs  walks  an  interesting  line  in  China,  between those who identify the marketization   of  culture  as  being  associated  with  creative  innovation and the integration of culture and  technology,  and  those  who  see  the  cultural  industries  as  inherently  tied  to  state  power  and the preservation of a distinctive Chinese  national  culture,  and  who  perceive  ‘creativ- ity’ as a ‘Trojan Horse’ for Western cultural  hegemony  and  neo-liberal  ideas.  In  that  respect,  there  are  parallels  between  debates  about creative industries in China and those  about  social  media:  both  potentially  point  in the direction of reduced state control and  greater individual freedom, but for precisely  that reason, both are closely monitored by the  Chinese party-state.  Europe has adopted the CCI concept, both  at  a  regional  level   European  Commission,  2010 , and in its nomination of ‘Capitals of  Culture’,  in  order  to  revivify  post-industrial  economies  around  the  arts,  media,  cultural  tourism  and  cultural  entrepreneurship.  At  the  same  time,  the  terminological  distinc- tion between ‘cultural industries’ and ‘crea- tive  industries’  has  been  quite  sharp  within  Europe;  in  some  nations,  such  as  Germany,  the  term  ‘industry’  is  associated  with  the  industrialization  of  culture,  and  the  asso- ciated  negation  of  aesthetics.  In  its  policy  documents,  the  European  Union   European  Commission,  2010   has  used  the  ‘concen- tric  circles’  approach  derived  from Throsby   2010: 26–27 , where ‘cultural industries’ are  seen as those where artistic inputs are para- mount   e.g.,  performing  and  creative  arts,  music , whereas ‘creative industries’ are seen  as those with primarily commercial motiva- tions  in  terms  of  how  creativity  is  applied   e.g.,  advertising,  architecture,  commercial  broadcasting .  The term ‘creative industries’ did not gain  policy  traction  in  the  United  States,  but  the  ‘creative  cities’  movement,  spearheaded  by  academic policy  entrepreneurs  such  as  Richard  Florida,  had  great  influence  among  urban  policy  makers,  and  was  a  significant  catalyst for investment in the arts and culture   Florida,  2002;  Grodach,  2013 .  It  has  been  notably  associated  with  the  revitalization    soCial Media and the Cultural and Creative industries   517  of  urban  centers  through  investment  in  new  cultural  institutions,  development  of  crea- tive clusters  particularly in decommissioned  industrial  spaces ,  and  the  development  of  a  bohemian  ambiance,  with  a  thriving  com- munity  of  bars,  music  venues,  live  events  and  urban  nightlife.  The  group  that  Florida  termed  the  ‘creative  class’,  who  are  those  whose work he saw as being most associated  with the application of creativity in business  as well as in the arts, have been seen as having  a catalytic role in the development of creative  cities: they are also the group most likely to be  extensively networked through social media.  social media and The   ccis: Three scenarios  While creative industries discourses and the  development of social media have developed  along parallel yet distinct paths, social media  have profoundly shaped the cultural and cre- ative industries themselves. We can identify  three  ways  in  which  the  uptake  of  social  media  has  transformed  the  CCIs:   1   as  amplifier, or as a means of expanding reach  and or  engagement;   2   as  disruptor,  being  connected to processes that undermined tra- ditional media and creative business models;  and  3  as transformer, leading to the emer- gence  of  new  types  of  media  and  creative  businesses  within  established  industries.   In developing this three-fold typology, I am  drawing upon the Weberian notion of ideal- types,  that  combines  the  subjective  under- standing  of  agents  themselves  with  an  interpretation of underlying causal logics or  systemic forces, to generate models that can  be  compared  against  empirical  evidence   Weber,  1978:  18–22; Aronovitch,  2012 .  It  is also apparent that there is not one type of  force  necessarily  dominant  in  one  industry  and  a  different  one  in  another.  Rather,  the  three ideal-types need to be seen as common  force-fields operating across the spectrum of  cultural and creative industries.  Social media as Amplifier:  Broadcasting and Twitter  The case of social media as amplifier refers  to  those  instances  where  the  use  of  social  media in a manner complementary to exist- ing business models has added value to those  cultural goods and services produced by and  through  the  cultural  and  creative  industries.  One  example  would  be  the  ways  in  which  social media platforms such as Facebook and  Twitter  enable  second  screen  engagement  with television content. In particular, Twitter  has  enabled  real-time  interaction  on  a  large  scale with television programs, in ways that  have the scope to add value to TV content by  developing user communities and social net- works  around  particular  programs  and  personalities.  Katie  Walsh   2014   observed  that  such  real-time interaction can be of value to audi- ences,  producers,  TV  networks  and  social  media  companies  simultaneously.  For  audi- ences,  ‘live-tweeting  television   and  recap- ping and commenting after an episode  is a  way for fans to participate in the show itself:  to  insert  themselves  into  the  game  of  tel- evision via technology and social networks’    K. Walsh, 2014: 13 . For producers, they are  better ‘able to cater  or not  to the fan response  that they receive on their shows, ensuring fan  appreciation  and  loyalty,  but  almost  more  importantly,  online  audience  visibility  has  seemed to solve the other issue of counting  audiences’  K. Walsh, 2014: 13 . For the tel- evision  networks,  ‘Tweets  become  tangible  evidence of audience attention, which serves  as a commodity to be bought and sold, and as  a new metric for counting audience metrics’   K. Walsh, 2014: 11 . Social media interac- tion could thus provide verifiable third-party  data  on  audience  engagement  that  can  be  presented to advertisers as evidence of those  to  whom  they  can  potentially  appeal  with  their  messages.  Finally,  evidence  of  large- scale interaction is valuable to the platforms  themselves. In Twitter’s 2014 IPO, this live- tweeting ‘was … the number one way that a    518  billion-dollar  company  was  going  to  prove  its  value’,  meaning  that  while  ‘social  net- working  sites  and  new  media  services  may  be groundbreaking, but they are still turning  to legacy media such as television as a way  to  monetize  their  services. While TV  might  be grasping onto Twitter in order to engage  audiences, Twitter is just as dependent on TV  for a business model’  K. Walsh, 2014: 15 .  For the television industry, the great boon  of  social  media  is  the  emphasis  upon  the  value of live-ness in broadcasting, and hence  on the value of advertising during programs.  A  vast  array  of  technological  devices  has  enabled  audiences  to  move  away  from  the  ‘tyranny  of  scheduling’  and  time-dependent  access to television content, including Digital  Video Recorders  DVRs , streaming services  such as Netflix and Hulu, and online catch-up  services. All of these typically provide users  with the capacity to filter out advertisements.  This  has  been  one  reason  why  advertising  revenues have held up most strongly for pro- gramming such as sports, where viewing the  event as it happens is most critical. Platforms  such as Twitter have been valuable in sports  broadcasting,  although  Billings   2014   has  questioned  claims  that  they  provide  bet- ter insight into the interests of the ‘average’  sports  fan.  One  area  where  the  impact  of  social media has been critical is that of politi- cal  television,  where  opinionated  hosts  and  guests  frequently  trigger  ‘Twitter  talk’,  and  where  social  media  platforms  enable  con- gregations of like minds and the dissemina- tion of views to a wider public  Himelboim,  2014 . The impact of social media has been  significant  for  both  traditional  political  tel- evision  formats  and  for  satirical  television  that engages with political issues  Gray et al.,  2009; Harrington, 2013 .  The  focus  thus  far  has  been  on  the  posi- tive aspects of the relationship between social  media and broadcast television. Katie Walsh   2014   has  made  the  point  that,  in  the  US  context,  there  is  little  correlation  between  the  most  watched  US  television  programs  and  those  which  attract  the  most  Twitter   comments.  This  should  not  surprise,  as  the  most  active  users  of  social  media  tend,  on  average, to be younger, better educated, and  more  likely  to  have  a  wider  range  of  enter- tainment  options  available  to  them  than  the  most  frequent  television  viewers.  There  is  also  the  issue  of  control  over  the  platform  itself. Whereas broadcast television has typi- cally been characterized by a high degree of  control over when and how content is distrib- uted, the social media environment tends to  one where content is more spreadable across  platforms  and  among  users   Jenkins  et  al.,  2013 . Moreover, distributors cannot control  what  is  said  on  social  media  platforms.  For  example,  the  Australian  interactive  politi- cal  panel  program  Q&A,  which  encourages  its viewers to tweet during the program and  screens  a  selection  of  the  tweets  during  the  show,  has  often  found  itself  open  to  allega- tions  of  political  bias  when  a  message  has  gone  across  the  screen  that  a  panel  guest  found  offensive  or  inappropriate   Flew  &  Swift, 2015 . In response to this, broadcasters  have sometimes created their own apps, ena- bling  participation  within  a  ‘walled  garden’  environment,  where  comments  are  closely  monitored by the provider themselves, rather  than relying upon the moderation practices of  third parties such as Twitter.  Social Media as Disruptor:   The Continuing Crisis of News  While social media have clearly created new  possibilities  in  some  CCIs,  they  have  also  profoundly disrupted others. The concept of  disruptive  innovation  comes  from  the  work  of  Harvard  Business  School  Professor  Clayton Christensen  2003 , and refers to the  ways in which changing market and techno- logical dynamics can lead to once successful  companies losing their dominance in indus- tries,  as  the  underlying  foundations  of  eco- nomic  relationships  and  associated  business  models  are  radically  transformed.  The  con- cept of disruptive innovation has resonances    soCial Media and the Cultural and Creative industries   519  in  the  evolutionary  economics  of  Joseph  Schumpeter   1950 ,  who  described  capital- ism  as  an  economic  system  based  upon  ‘gales  of  creative  destruction’,  where  the  core dynamic of competition was less about  marginal  price  changes  in  markets  than  it  was  about  entrepreneurs  continually  trans- forming economies, firms, industries, institu- tions and jobs in the relentless search for new  sources of profit. Capitalism is an economic  system  where  ‘creative  destruction  fosters  economic growth but also … undercuts cher- ished human values’  McCraw, 2007: 349 .  Digital  technology  industries  are  particu- larly prone to disruptive innovation, as there  is  a  highly  fluid  and  variable  relationship  between rates of uptake of new technologies  and  digital  services,  due  to  the  interaction  between  user  adoption  of  new  technologies  and the manner in which the associated prod- ucts  and  services  improve  over  time   Flew,  2014: 150–153 . In some instances, there is  significant first-mover advantage. The rise of  Amazon as one of the world’s largest inter- net  companies  came  from  the  realization  of  founder  Jeff  Bezos  in  the  1990s  that  the  Internet enabled a new way of selling books,  as  it  greatly  expanded  global  market  reach  while  simultaneously  allowing  for  greatly  reduced  inventory  costs.  There  was  thus  the scope to benefit from long tail econom- ics   Anderson,  2009   by  offering  for  sale  a  much  wider  range  of  titles  that  had  more  niche  readerships  than  conventional  book- stores  could  offer:  Amazon  also  pioneered  user recommendation systems as a means by  which  consumers  could  get  valuable  third- party  information  about  particular  titles.  In  other  cases,  the  primary  benefits  have  gone to second movers. In the music indus- try,  the  rise  of  Napster  threatened  conven- tional music businesses by allowing for free  downloads of songs. The major music labels  responded  by  driving  Napster  out  of  busi- ness  for  copyright  infringement,  but  Apple  successfully  adopted  the  core  elements  of  the  Napster  business  models  –  namely,  that  people  wanted  individual  songs  in  digital   formats rather than bundled CDs – and came  to dominate the music industry in the 2000s.  Its  primary  competitors,  such  as  Spotify,  today  offer  individual  songs  as  part  of  sub- scription  packages,  meaning  that  the  music  business  in  the  2010s  has  little  in  common  with the form it took in the 1990s  Knopper,  2009; Wikström, 2013 .  One  sector  where  social  media  have  had  a  particularly  disruptive  impact  has  been  news. News organizations were early adop- ters  of  digital  media,  recognizing  the  value  of  the  Internet  as  providing  a  new  channel  for  news  distribution,  as  well  as  providing  superior means for checking information and  allowing  for  greater  content  sharing  within  the organization. But while there was adap- tation to the new digital environment within  newsrooms, underlying elements of journal- istic  practice  and  culture  remained  unchal- lenged, namely that:  1  journalists produced  content  for  a  single  outlet,  and  in  a  single  format  print, radio, television, etc. ;  2  they  worked  for  established  news  mastheads;    3   they  were  the  only  trusted  sources  of  news,  on  the  basis  of  their  skills  and  pro- fessional  accreditation;  and   4   their  work- related  communication  was  primarily  with  their  news  sources  rather  than  with  their  readers, viewers or listeners.  Jane  Singer   2010:  103   has  pointed  out  that, by the late 2000s ‘none of those things  were true’, as the traditional boundaries were  breached to the point where:  Deadlines are continuous, and stories are updated  whenever  new  information  becomes  available.  Content of all sorts flows in from everywhere and  everyone, and even the bits produced by journal- ists  are  no  longer  necessarily  routed  through  a  newsroom  or an editor  before appearing online.  The  unmanaged  and  perhaps  unmanageable  nature  of  the  network  itself,  with  its  myriad   intertwined  links  and  updates  every  nanosecond,  creates an essentially infinite, unbounded product.   Singer, 2010: 107   The  crisis  in  traditional  journalism  has  had  the hardest impact on newspapers. There has  been a significant decline in the readership of    520  newspapers  as  readers  increasingly  turn  to  online  sources  for  news.  It  has  been  esti- mated  that  time  spent  reading  newspapers  fell  by  about  one-third  worldwide  between  2010  and  2017,  with  particularly  sharp  declines  in  established  news  media  markets  such  as  the  United  States   globally,  such  trends are offset in part by growth in coun- tries  such  as  India  and  China,  where  rising  literacy levels have led to increased newspa- per  readership    Zenith  OptiMedia,  2015 .  Many  newspaper  titles  have  closed,  while  others have gone to online only. In the online  environment,  traditional  news  titles  face  strong competition from a range of new online  sites,  including  Huffington  Post,  VICE,  BuzzFeed  and  others,  that  are  often  more  attuned to the habits and interests of younger  users. There has also been significant interna- tionalization  of  online  news,  with  globally  recognized  brands  such  as  The  Guardian,  Daily Mail, Wall Street Journal and The New  York Times generating sites for new markets in  Asia and in countries such as Australia.  International  broadcasters  have  also  expanded  their  worldwide  operations,  often  under the aegis of the national governments  seeking to expand the ‘soft power’ influence  in  world  affairs:  the  BBC,  China’s  CCTV,  Russia  Today,  Japan’s  NHK  and  several  other broadcasters have been expanding both  their online operations and their international  reach  Sparks, 2016 . In areas such as sport,  clubs  and  code  administrators  have  them- selves  developed  significant  news  websites,  that make it less relevant to go to generalist  news sources to get information such as the  results  of  matches.  Journalists  themselves  have  lost  their  privileged  status  as  the  sole  providers  of  news,  as  a  range  of  bloggers,  citizen journalists and others circulate infor- mation online to their specialist readerships,  in  a  process  greatly  enhanced  by  distribu- tion and sharing across social media content  platforms.  By  far  the  most  disruptive  impact  of  social  media  upon  news  organizations,  and  indeed  upon  all  media  industries,  has  been   upon  their  traditional  business  models.  The  traditional  newspaper  relied  upon  a  mix  of  three  sources  of  revenue:   1   direct  sales;    2  advertising; and  3  classifieds. All three  of  these  were  significantly  eroded  over  the  first decade of the 2000s. Classified revenues  dried  up  as  specialist  online  sites  proved  to  be  far  more  effective  means  of  promoting  and selling those products and  services that  had traditionally used classified advertising:  real  estate,  car  sales,  job  advertisements,  trade  services,  etc. With  regards  to  content,  social media platforms are built around shar- ing: the ability to circulate and share content  invites users to continue to engage with the  platforms, and is also central to building the  profile  and  ‘brand  identity’  of  those  who  create  the  original  content,  as  well  as  those  who  re-circulate  it   Markham,  2016 .  This  means that the content that is most popular on  social media sites is that which is most easily  shared, and a core condition for that is that it  is freely available. This has presented media  businesses with a core contradiction. To boost  their own profile, and hence their audiences,  sales and revenues, they need to make their  content  widely  available  and  easily  accessi- ble, which generally correlates with making  it available for free. When online news sites  have responded by establishing paywalls and  subscriber-only content, they have generally  experienced a sharp loss in their readerships,  unless their content is truly unique and hence  able to command a premium price. However,  making content freely available undercuts the  ability to employ staff and resources to gen- erate  new  content,  as  there  are  not  revenue  streams  associated  with  the  new  content.  News  organizations  have  responded  by  cut- ting  staff,  downsizing  newsrooms,  sharing  content,  and  outsourcing  activities  such  as  sub-editing, but this has risked generating a  downward  spiral,  as  they  have  less  internal  capacity  to  generate  the  original  and  com- pelling  content  that  would  draw  readers  to  their sites, in an environment with a greatly  expanded  degree  of  user  choice   Doyle,  2013: 76–98 .   soCial Media and the Cultural and Creative industries   521  This has meant that traditional media busi- nesses have had to put a greater reliance upon  advertising as a source of revenue, hoping that  distribution  of  content  through  social  media  platforms will drive new user traffic to their  sites,  thus  being  successful  for  the  ‘compe- tition  for  eyeballs’  in  the  attention  economy   Lanham, 2006; Webster, 2014 . Phenomena  such  as  ‘clickbait’   content  with  sensational  headlines  or  pictures  that  encourage  readers  to  click  through  out  of  curiosity   and  ‘chur- nalism’  re-use of pre-packaged content such  as media releases  arose in this environment,  as cheap ways of attracting readers online to  sites: celebrity stories and scandals have been  reliable means of attracting the relatively dis- engaged online user through such techniques   Davies,  2008;  Jackson  &  Moloney,  2015 .  But advertising has proven to be an ever less  reliable  means  of  funding  content  as  prolif- eration of content, combined with access on  the part of clients to ever more detailed demo- graphic  data  about  those  who  view  content  online, has led to the price that can be charged  for online advertising falling dramatically. It  has  become  increasingly  apparent  that,  the  big winners from online advertising spend are  increasingly the online platforms themselves,  rather  than  the  content  providers   Knapp,  2014 . This is because they operate in multi- sided markets, where they can be positioned  as the mediating platform providers for multi- ple producers and consumers, none of whom  has equivalent market power in relevant trans- action  spaces   Bauer,  2014 .  The  growing  use  of  adblocker  software  by  users  also  hits  the content-based sites harder than platform- based  ones,  as  the  latter  typically  have  their  advertising already embedded within the site   so-called ‘native advertising’ , rather than as  unrelated material that hangs off the main site.  Social Media as Transformer:  Algorithmic Screen Media  The  final  context  to  be  considered  is  that  where  social  media  act  as  a  transformer  of   media  and  creative  industries.  The  digital  transformation of CCIs has elements of both  amplification and disruption about it, as can  be seen with the case of new forms of distri- bution of screen media content that combine  digital  delivery  and  traditional  long-form  formats  for  media  such  as  film  and  televi- sion.  For  other  broadcasters,  as  well  as  the  cable industry, new streaming media services  such  as  Netflix,  Hulu  and  Amazon  TV,  as  well as China’s iQiyi and LeTV and a variety  of other streaming services around the world,  challenge  and  potentially  undermine  tradi- tional media industry business models. While  the  major  revenue  sources  for  broadcast  media  have  been  advertising  revenue,  sub- scription  to  a  bundle  of  channels,  and  tax- payer  funding,  the  new  models  offer  a  different  type  of  subscription  service,  more  akin  to  being  a  member  of  a  ‘club’,  where  membership offers access to a wider range of  content  than  is  the  case  with  traditional  broadcasting,  but  less  than  the  large  bundle  of  often  unrelated  channels  provided  by  cable services. At the same time, these new  services are highly supportive of new content  developers,  being  prepared  to  invest  large  amounts of money in the commissioning of  original  content.  This  is  different  from  the  relationship of services such as Facebook to  news producers, where they amplify distribu- tion but do not invest in the creation of new  content  Cunningham & Silver, 2013 . High- budget,  and  highly  acclaimed,  productions  such  as  House  of  Cards,  Transparent  and  Orange is the New Black were developed by  Netflix and Amazon as part of their strategies  to build a new subscriber base.  At  the  core  of  the  ‘Netflix  model’  is  the  new  relationship  established  between  algo- rithmic  sorting  and  ‘Big  Data’  on  the  one  hand, and cultural production and distribution  on the other. Broadcast media have tradition- ally  relied  upon  rating  data  as  the  basis  for  programming  decisions,  basing  judgements  on  data  derived  from  relatively  small  sam- ple  sizes  and  a  high  propensity  for  various  forms of bias and unreliability  Balnaves &     522  O’Regan,  2002 .  By  contrast,  Netflix  has  drawn  upon  the  kinds  of  recommendations  technologies developed by social media com- panies  such  as  Facebook,  e-commerce  sites  such as Amazon, and a wide range of online  dating  sites.  The  ‘recommendation  algo- rithm’   Hallinan  &  Striphas,  2016   draws  upon  the  invitations  Netflix  offers  its  cus- tomers to rate content online, through both a  one-to-five star ratings system and the oppor- tunity to comment on the material viewed. As  Hallinan and Striphas have noted, this entails  a  shift  in  cultural  authority  from  those  who  have traditionally judged the nature of ‘good  works’   critics,  academics,  award  judges,  etc.  to ‘the realm of technique and engineer- ing, where individuals with no obvious con- nection  to  a  particular  facet  of  the  cultural  field  i.e., media  are developing frameworks  with which to reconcile those difficult ques- tions’  Hallinan & Striphas, 2016: 122 .  The ‘Netflix model’ is also associated with  a  shift  in  marketing  practices,  and  program- ming practices which aim to attract advertisers,  from broad demographics and socio-graphics   age, gender, ethnicity, income, etc.  towards  an  understanding  of  individuals  as  nodes  within social networks, where the art of pro- gramming involves the identification of over- laps between different types of preference. In  developing a program such as House of Cards,  where Netflix apparently offered $US100 mil- lion and outbid cable channels such as HBO,  Netflix  ‘took  a  factor-based  approach  …   using its algorithms to decompose the prop- erty  to  determine  whether  an  audience  might exist for some combination of “David  Fincher,” his “style,” the collection of genres  across which he has worked, “Kevin Spacey,”  the specific genre of political thriller, and so  forth’  Hallinan & Striphas, 2016: 128 .  The  wider  implications  of  algorithmic  culture  are  open  to  debate.  If  its  ability  to  generate content such as House of Cards and  Orange is the New Black is an indication, it  may  provide  a  formula  for  more  effectively  meeting  the  tastes  of  niche  audiences  than  either  broadcast  television,  which  sought  to   maximize  overall  audience  share,  or  cable  channels,  which  have  sought  to  aggregate  audiences around particular program genres.  This  process  of  ‘leveraging  crowd  wisdom’   Striphas,  2015:  407   in  order  to  generate  content  tailored  to  revealed  subscriber  pref- erences  may  be,  as  the  platform  providers  sometimes imply, a democratization of pub- lic culture. But the reality is that it is almost  impossible  to  know  what  the  algorithms  are, guarded as they are by patent law, trade  secrets,  non-disclosure  agreements,  and  so  forth  Gillespie, 2010 . In such a context, the  claims to ‘“crowd wisdom” is largely just a  stand-in  …  for  algorithmic  data  processing,  which  is  increasingly  becoming  a  private,  exclusive and indeed profitable affair … and  why  companies  like  Amazon,  Google  and  Facebook  are  fast  becoming,  despite  their  populist rhetoric, the new apostles of culture’   Striphas, 2015: 408 .  conclusion  In this chapter, we have considered the rela- tionship of social media to three trends in the  cultural and creative industries, using applied  case studies. The first trend is that of ampli- fication, where social media can both expand  the reach and enhance the appeal of creative  product by allowing for second-screen com- municaion about the content. This has been  most successfully applied in the area of tel- evision, although the appeal of social media  engagement differs significantly across pro- gram types and genres. The second has been  that of disruption, as social media, and digi- tal  media  platforms  more  generally,  funda- mentally  change  how  we  consume  media  content,  to  the  disadvantage  of  incumbent  media and creative industries. The impact of  social media on journalism is a strong case in  point. Finally, there are cases of fundamental  transformation of how cultural and creative  industries operate. The impact of algorithmic  sorting  and  other  developments  enabled  by    soCial Media and the Cultural and Creative industries   523  ‘Big Data’ and automation is at a relatively  early  stage,  but  the  relationship  between  such  consumer  information  and  new  forms  of screen content, as seen with cases such as  Netflix,  points  towards  the  possibility  that  we  are  at  the  early  stages  of  much  wider  transformations.  The  case  of  new  recommendation-based  and  data-driven  models  of  media  such  as  Netflix, and their equivalents in fields such  as music, news and other cultural and crea- tive  industries,  reveals  the  growing  signifi- cance of algorithmic culture. In this respect,   the  relationship  between  the  cultural  and  creative  industries  and  digital  and  social  media is becoming an ever closer one. It has  been argued in this chapter that the relation- ship has indeed been close in practice, even  if CCI debates and those surrounding digital  technologies have frequently occurred along  parallel paths. It is now essential to conceive  of  the  CCIs  as  being  enmeshed  in  a  wider  digital  economy,  but  one  where  the  value  of creativity remains significant, and where  those  fields  through  which  developments  in the CCIs are critically evaluated, such as  the academic disciplines associated with the  arts, media and design, retain a key role in  how  we  think  about  phenomena  associated  with social media, such as algorithmic cul- ture and the ‘sharing economy’. While many  of the most intense debates around the inter- section between creative industries and digi- tal  culture  have  been  around  the  changing  status  of  intellectual  property,  and  associ- ated legal, ethical and policy issues, they are  increasingly likely to be turning to questions  around  the  political  economy  of  the  net- worked  digital  and  social  media  platforms  themselves.  Note   1    In  this  chapter,  I  will  focus  primarily  upon  digi- tal  media  companies,  particularly  those  which  provide platforms for digitally-mediated commu- nication. It will not focus exclusively upon those  companies that are considered to be primarily in   the  ‘social  media’  space,  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter.  This  recognizes  that  many  of  the  com- panies that have had the most disruptive impact  upon  the  creative  industries  are  not  necessarily  engaged in providing platforms to facilitiate per- son-to-person online communication.  references  Alasuutari, P.  2013  ‘Spreading global models  and  enhancing  banal  localism:  The  case  of  local  government  cultural  policy  develop- ment’,  International  Journal  of  Cultural  Policy, 19 1 , 103–119.

Campaign  web- sites have played a role in US communications  efforts since the mid-1990s, when the Clinton  Gore  and  Dole Kemp  campaigns  developed  the  first  presidential  campaign  websites. The  voter data programs that campaigns now use  daily have their roots in tools developed in the  late 1980s, and have benefitted from evolution  and infrastructure building within parties. The  very data such programs rely upon still involve  opinion polls, which have been a meaningful  part of campaigns since the 1960s.1 Although  campaigns  were  slow  to  adopt  the  participa- tory, reciprocal affordances that were tenets of  web 2.0  O’Reilly, 2005 , the 2004 Dean cam- paign  and  2008  Obama  campaigns’  use  of  social  platforms  such  as  Facebook,  Meetup,  and  Myspace  marked  a  more  fundamental  shift: the rise of social media campaigning.  Social  media  campaigning  marks  both  an  evolution  of  traditional  campaign  practices   and a space of opportunity for new strategies  and norms to emerge. In the years since 2008,  campaigns of all sizes have had to grapple with  the adoption of digital tools to supplement their  existing methods of persuasion and mobiliza- tion, which has led to strategic and technical  innovation, as well as the solidification of some  existing  practices.  This  chapter  highlights  what social media strategies look like now that  the  dust  of  the  revolutionary  2008  elections  has settled, what effects these emerging strate- gies have had on a variety of campaign goals in  both the American and European context, and  how the on-the-fly adoption of new tactics and  tools has resulted in unintended consequences  for campaigns. Specifically, this chapter drills  down further into three particular social media  campaign strategies and their unintended con- sequences – opening up campaign content to  public  feedback  while  encouraging  citizens  to  ‘talk  back,’  the  adoption  of  widely  avail- able, popular social media platforms, and the  increase in campaigns’ attention to analytics.   528  To investigate these practices, this research  combines  a  review  of  quantitative  cam- paign  research  that  draws  primarily  on  US  and  European  cases  with  original  qualita- tive research investigating campaign tactics,  professional  trainings  for  political  consult- ants and staffers, and campaign messages in  the US. It draws on data spanning the years  2010–2014, including ethnographic observa- tions  of  a  federal-level  campaign  in  2010,  in-depth interviews of over 40 campaign con- sultants  following  the  2010  and  2012  cam- paigns, brief interviews with an additional 15  staffers  and  consultants  following  the  2014  election, and textual analysis of training ses- sions at professional consulting conferences  over the course of those four years  Baldwin- Philippi, 2015 . The original research in this  chapter  is  devoted  to  the  US,  although  it  attempts to draw attention to similarities and  differences  in  uses  across  national  contexts  to highlight the ways country-context matters  and can influence strategic choices.  As  campaign  practices  evolve  over  time  and adoption differs across national contexts,  this  chapter  draws  on  actor-network  theory   Latour,  2005   to  situate  the  emergence  of  new  practices  as  a  product  of  individual  staffers and consultants as well as the tech- nologies  they  deploy,  and  emphasizes  both  the material aspects of social media as well  as their patterns of use. In line with calls for  communication  studies  as  a  discipline  to  more deeply investigate the material aspects  of communication technologies  Boczkowski  & Lievrouw, 2008 , this chapter also focuses  on  the  affordances  and  interfaces  of  social  media  and  analytics  platforms  in  order  to  illuminate the ways platform changes result  in  shifts  in  strategy  or  priorities  for  cam- paigns.  Though  deductive  and  quantitative  approaches  still  drive  most  political  com- munication  research,  the  adopted  inductive  approach  allows  for  investigation  into  the  socio-technical  interactions  between  cam- paigns and technologies. Such an inquiry can  illuminate  the  causes  and  consequences  of  emerging  campaign  strategies,  and,  in  turn,   develop  digitally-situated  theories  of  politi- cal participation and institutional politics, as  has been called for in recent years  Bennett &   Iyengar,  2008;  Karpf,  Kreiss,  Nielsen,  &  Powers, 2015 .  Combining a review of quantitative, inter- national  literature  with  qualitative  work  in  the US context, this chapter seeks to explain  how  social  media  campaigning  builds  on  and  influences  prior  campaign  strategies.  First,  it  will  illuminate  the  current  state  of  cutting-edge  social  media  strategy  in  the  US and explain how social media platforms  are  currently  used  in  other  countries,  while  also  focusing  on  the  impact  of  this  use  on  citizens. Second, it highlights the problem of  unintended consequences in the adoption of  new social media platforms: changes to both  the user interface and backend of Facebook  and Twitter from 2010 to 2014 have played a  vital role in the development of social media   content  and  impacted  strategic  decisions.  Third, this chapter will discuss the normative,  democratic implications of these practices.  WhaT are campaigns doing?  Obama’s  2008  campaign  has  been  dubbed  the  Facebook  election  by  academics  and  journalists  alike   Harfoush,  2009;  Lutz,  2009; Sabato, 2009; Trippi, 2008 , as it was  the first to make use of social platforms that  are  now  commonplace  in  political  cam- paigns,  and  harness  user-created  content  in  these  spaces.  Although  other  examples  of  pioneering  digital  campaigns  exist,  such  as  Australian Labor Party  ALP  Leader Kevin  Rudd’s 2007 use of Myspace to garner sup- port  en  route  to  the  ALP’s  victory  and  become  Prime  Minister,  the  Obama  cam- paign was perceived as the first to combine  use  of  social  media  platforms  with  on-the- ground  mobilization  in  a  wide-scale  and  effective  manner.  The  Obama  2008  team  used  YouTube  to  provide  volunteers  with  backstage videos from campaign staffers and    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   529  the  candidate  himself,  and  the  user-created  video,  ‘I  got  a  Crush  On  Obama’  was  so  popular  that  it  was  later  named  a  top  ten  meme of the decade by Newsweek  Allison,  2009 . The Obama campaign had over 2 mil- lion  Facebook  followers  and  more  than  112,000 Twitter supporters, to John McCain’s  600,000  and  4,600  respectively   Dutta  &  Fraser,  2008 ,  and  they  also  made  use  of  blogging  networks  and  other  more  niche  platforms  like  Flickr,  Digg,  LinkedIn,  BlackPlanet, and MiGente. While these plat- forms themselves were less robust than they  are now, the Obama campaign created groups  to which supporters could subscribe in order  to  show  their  support,  receive  campaign  updates,  and  find  sharable  images  with  Obama’s campaign logo, website and picture  on  them..2  Despite  these  new  tools  that  the  campaign  deployed,  the  successes  of  the  Obama campaign and the national Democratic  party  more  broadly  were,  as  Daniel  Kreiss   2012b   has  detailed,  rooted  in  the  party’s  adoption of technology in the following elec- tion  cycle.  Moreover,  as  Rasmus  Kleis  Nielsen’s  work  has  shown   2012 ,  while  social media were exciting and highly visible  in  campaigns  in  2008,  campaigns  relied  much  more  heavily  on  using  voter  data  to  make in-person contact with potential voters  through  traditional  mobilization  efforts  like  canvassing.  Following  the  Obama  campaign’s  wide  margin  of  victory,  and  the  perception  that  social media was a driving force of the cam- paign’s  success,  political  campaigns  at  all  levels proceeded to get on board, campaign- ing  through  social  media.  Despite  the  fact  that  political  campaigns’  goals  remain  the  same  in  an  age  of  social  media  campaign- ing – electing a candidate through a combi- nation  of  persuasive  messaging,  mobilizing  fundraising  and  volunteer  efforts,  and  get- ting  out  the  vote   GOTV   –  social  media  platforms  have  allowed  campaigns  to  make  slight  changes  to  the  ways  they  go  about  these  goals,  and  have  even  catalyzed  the  adoption  of  a  handful  of  new  ones  as  well.   All of these changes are due not only to the  availability  of  social  media  tools  and  their  increasingly  widespread  adoption  by  cam- paigns, but are also a product of the changing  technological affordances of these platforms.  Insofar as social media are provided by pri- vately-run  companies,  decisions  about  what  to allow campaigns  or any account manager   to do, how and when paid-programming can  purchased, and even the visual layout of the  user interface are out of the campaigns’ con- trol. As campaigns adopt these social media  platforms  and  their  changing  technological  affordances, their own strategies and empha- ses  concerning  how  and  when  to  use  such  tools change as well.  Social Media Adoption  In  the  years  since  the  Obama  campaign’s  2008 victory and the subsequent coronation  of  social  media  campaigning  in  American  politics, campaigns’ use of social media tools –   social networking systems like Facebook and  Twitter, as well as less socially-oriented plat- forms like YouTube – has increased rapidly.  In  2010,  as  statewide  and  local  campaigns  began to grapple with the adoption of digital  media,  the  presence  of  campaign-controlled  social  media  accounts  was  clear,  but  not  ubiquitous,  with  78%  of  Senate  and  House  campaigns using official YouTube channels,  71%  using  campaign  Twitter  accounts,  and  82%  using  campaign  Facebook  accounts   Williams  &  Gulati,  2011 .  Just  two  years  later, the use of such platforms had become  nearly  universal,  with  97%  of  Senate  cam- paigns  and  90.2%  of  Congressional  cam- paigns  using  an  official  Facebook  account   Gulati  &  Williams,  2015 ,  and  has  stayed  stable.  In contrast, European political campaigns  have  been  slower  to  take  up  social  media  platforms  at  both  the  candidate  and  party  level.  In  2010,  social  media  campaigning  was said to have ‘failed to fire’ in Germany   Marcinkowski & Metag, 2014  and the UK    530   Aldrich,  Gibson,  Cantijoch,  &  Konitzer,  2016 ,  with  only  30%  of  campaigns  using  social  networks.  By  2013,  these  numbers  had risen only to 76.6 % of campaigns hav- ing  profiles  on  either  Twitter  or  Facebook,  with  a  slightly  lower  number   72.3%   actively  maintaining  those  accounts   Hinz,  2014 .  Similarly  low  use  numbers  for  elec- tions  occurring  in  2010  and  2011  occurred  in the Netherlands  32%  and Finland  19%  of  candidates    Vergeer  &  Hermans,  2013 .  Not  only  did  many  European  candidates  and parties refrain from the immediate post- Obama-’08 uptake in social media; in many  cases  this  trend  continued  in  the  years  to  come.  In  2013,  only  26.2%  of  Australian  candidates were on Twitter, and that percent- age was largely composed of candidates who  were  party  spokespeople  or  ‘frontbench- ers’   Bruns  &  Highfield,  2015 .  Similarly,  Norway’s  2013  election  saw  only  24%  of  candidates  with  social  media  accounts,  and  Sweden’s  election  that  same  year  saw  a  meager  19%   Larsson,  2015 .  Across  most  countries, candidates belonging to opposition  parties, or those not in power, are more likely  to adopt Twitter as a channel to get out their  message  Jungherr, 2016 .  Although  European  candidates’  use  of  social  media  looks  considerably  different  from  candidates  in  the  US,  these  countries’  party-centric parliamentary systems and sub- sequently reduced need for candidates to craft  personal political identities are the likely rea- son for such vast differences. Indeed, we see  that  parties’  use  of  social  and  digital  media  is widespread, and perceptions of its impor- tance  are  similar  across  European  nations.  Signaling  the  adoption  of  what  Andrew  Chadwick  2013  has called the hypermedia  style, the use of social tools do spread from  the US, outward, even if specific tactics and  strategies are influenced by the local political  contexts  Lilleker, Tenscher, & Štětka, 2015 .  Candidates in the European context, in con- trast to the US, do not seem to provide voters  with  personal  information,  in  social  media  content  or  elsewhere   Hermans  &  Vergeer,   2013;  Kriesi,  2012 .  The  phenomenon  of  candidate or party adoption of professional- ized, consultant-based campaign strategies is  not  limited  to  the  adoption  of  social  media  tools.  Campaigns  also  use  analytics  soft- ware to assess the impact of digital campaign  communications. As  McKelvey  and  Piebiak   2014   have  shown,  off-the-shelf  analytics  tools like NationBuilder, which were devel- oped and first used in US campaigns, are now  widely used in Canada.  Persuasion in Social Media  As  campaigns  increasingly  adopt  social  media and discover best practices for craft- ing  content  that  is  popular  and  persuasive,  social  media  messages  have  emerged  as  a  genre that in some ways mirrors traditional  broadcast  messaging,  while  making  small  changes that allow campaigns to take advan- tage of networked relationships. Campaigns’  early use of social media saw a repetition of  traditional  communications  strategies,  as  campaigns in 2010 often used Facebook and  Twitter as places to amplify the same persua- sive  messages  they  were  used  to  creating,  rather  than  developing  new  norms  of  con- tent. As a result, their social media accounts  were  often  overrun  with  press  releases  and  campaign  ads.  In  2010,  out  of  fourteen  Senate  and  Congressional  level  campaigns  in  Illinois  that  had  an  active  social  media  presence,  nine  of  their  Facebook  accounts  had a plurality of traditional content such as  event  coverage,  press  releases,  and  links  to  stories on their own campaign websites. Not  only  was  the  content  often  identical  across  these  platforms,  with  campaigns  taking  advantage  of  programs  that  automatically  pushed  content  from  one  platform  to  the  other, but campaigns also used it as a way to  link  back  to  their  own  campaign  websites.  As  one  communications  director  from  a  Congressional  race  explains  it,  ‘Capturing  people and getting them stuck in something  like  flypaper  –  they  go  to  your  website  …    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   531  then  they’re  looking  at  your  education  plan,  and go to the Facebook page, and the Facebook  takes  them  to  the  Twitter  feed,  Twitter  feed  takes  them  to  the YouTube  page  …  they’re  continuing to browse and they’re staying on  your  message’   personal  communication,  January 18, 2011 .  Similar  findings  showed  that  both  US   Gerodimos & Justinussen, 2015; Hemphill,  Otterbacher, & Shapiro, 2013  and European  campaigns  used  social  media  for  unidirec- tional,  broadcast  communication,  including  the UK  Graham, Broersma, Hazelhoff, & van  ‘t Haar, 2013  and Germany  Jungherr, 2016 .  Additionally, in a small study of how elected  officials’  from  the  US  Congress,  European  Parliament,  and  Korean  National  Assembly  used Twitter as of 2012, Otterbacher, Shapiro,  and  Hemphill   2013 ,  found  that  interac- tive  features  such  as  tagging,  @replying,  retweeting,  use  of  pictures  and  videos,  and  so  on,  are  not  widely  used.  Despite  study- ing  only  a  handful  of  representatives,  their  findings  indicated  that  the  European  MEPs  and  Korean  assembly  members  used  more  of these interactive features than their coun- terparts in the US Congress. A much larger- scale study of US campaigns’ use of Twitter  by  Jason  Gainous  and  Kevin Wagner  found  that challengers and Republicans were more  likely to use those features  2013 .  Interestingly, while social media messages  take  the  form  of  unidirectional,  broadcast  messages, their content is not an exact dupli- cation of campaigns’ mass media strategies.  Major  differences  lie  in  the  fact  that  social  media content is less issue-based, and more  often  used  to  draw  attention  to  campaign  events  and  opportunities  to  get  involved  with campaigns, and that it is more positive  than  television  advertisements   Bode  et  al.,  2011 .  Moreover,  these  same  findings  show  that  external  political  factors  that  have  his- torically made it likely a campaign will use  negative  ads,  such  as  incumbency  or  close- ness of the race, do not make it any more or  less  likely  that  these  same  candidates  will  publicize  negative  content  in  social  media   spaces. While social media content has been  increasingly  image-driven  since  2010  and  those images have become more professional  in their aesthetics and composition  Baldwin- Philippi, 2015 , political campaigns have also  begun to harness the popularity of memes in  social media, crafting content that is humor- ous  and  that  encourages  citizens  to  create  similar content of their own  Graef, n.d. .  As campaigns and advocacy groups alike  adopted  networked  communication  plat- forms,  they  innovated  the  channels  through  which  they  dispersed  their  broadcast-style  messages.  Not  only  were  they  publishing  content  on  social  media  platforms,  but  the  flow  of  campaign  communications  became  networked as well. As Daniel Kreiss  2012a   has shown, the Obama campaign used blog- gers on the activist left to break news stories  that  would  likely  damage  the  opposition.   A  related  practice  also  spread  in  the  subse- quent election cycles, with campaigns com- monly  feeding  stories  to  partisan  political  bloggers when they could not get the subject  picked up by more mainstream reporters with  wider  circulation.  Beginning  in  2010,  most  campaigns also directly enlisted supporters to  spread, pass along, and share social content –  even  before  the  practice  was  so  widespread  that  Facebook  introduced  a  ‘share’  button  to  make  the  practice  even  easier   Baldwin- Philippi, 2015 .  Social media platforms became especially  productive means through which campaigns  could  identify  and  directly  contact  opinion  leaders  and or  surrogates,  crafting  a  new,  networked  version  of  the  two-step-flow  of  information   Katz  &  Lazarsfeld,  1955 .  Campaigns  saw  digital  opinion  leaders  as  especially  valuable  precisely  because  they  expanded  the  population  of  valued  opinion  leaders  beyond  that  of  mainstream  media,  to include more diverse outlooks and critics  of  traditional  media  institutions.  Similarly,  while  Twitter  is  most  obviously  a  platform  for  publicly  broadcasting  a  message  to  a  campaign’s  supporters  and  followers,  it  has  also  been  used  as  a  way  to  directly  reach    532  out  to  individuals  who  may  be  engaging  in  political  discussions  online  and  persuade  in  more direct, interpersonal ways. This was a  tactic that was sporadically deployed among  the  most  tech-savvy  digital  consultants  in  2010,  but  it  was  refined  and  routinized  by  the  2012  Obama  campaign,  when  the  cam- paign directly emailed Twitter users they had  deemed  opinion  leaders  on  the  platform  to  ask  them  to  ‘Join  the  Obama  2012  Twitter  Team […] help turn out the vote for President  Obama  […]  Retweet!  Retweet!  Retweet!”’  Communications  and  digital  consultants  who began this practice in a haphazard way  as early as 2010 described seeking out unde- cided voters on Twitter in the weeks and days  leading  up  to  an  election  and  reaching  out  to  them  directly  in  efforts  to  persuade   per- sonal communication, March 4, 2011 . To do  so,  however,  required  specialized  targeting  of  more  supportive  members,  which  meant  more  precise  data  and  advanced  technical  skill, and was thus a tactic used only by more  advanced staffers and consultants. By 2012,  the social network analyses and social media  analytics  that  were  both  integral  to  locating  these  individuals  were  becoming  a  routine  part  of  major  presidential  campaigns  in  the  US.  This  level  of  data  strategy  was  largely  absent in European countries.  Micro-targeting and   Mobilization  One of the most fundamental changes to digi- tal strategy since 2008 has been the increas- ingly  specific  ability  to  target  messages  to  individuals  through  email,  social  networks,  and even individual online ads. This practice  of  micro-targeting  has  its  roots  in  highly- segmented  public  opinion  polls  of  the  1996  Clinton  campaign,  and  has  only  increased  with  the  advent  of  digital  advertising.  As  social  media  platforms  have  become  places  where people disclose a large amount of per- sonal information, campaigns are able to gain  access to much of it when purchasing social   media  ads,  and  use  it  to  categorize  people  based on geography, interests, issue-salience,  or  demographic  information.  Social  media  platforms  allow  campaigns  to  better  know  their  audience,  locate  specific  audiences,  define  and  create  their  own  audiences,  and  then  target  them  with  specifically  tailored  ads.  This  was  a  widely  used  tactic  at  the  Congressional level as early as 2010. In terms  of persuasive messaging, social media can be  used to broadcast messages in the traditional,  public  sense,  and  to  simultaneously  micro- target  those  same  messages  to  increasingly  small slices of relevant potential audiences.  While  the  2008  Obama  campaign  used  Facebook  to  both  broadcast  and  target  their  messages via public posts and advertisements  respectively, the platforms and strategies for  doing so have changed dramatically over the  past  eight  years.  In  2010,  the  line  between  public  and  targeted  content  was  clearly   drawn – posts were public  unless sent directly  and  privately  to  individuals ,  and  advertise- ments were available to be targeted based on  users’  location,  age,  gender,  and  interests.  Though many campaigns engaged in both tac- tics, they were sometimes surprised and often  frustrated  at  the  difference  in  affordances,  and  their  inability  to  use  the  targeting  tools  they  used  for  advertising  to  target  regular  public posts or messages  Fieldnotes, August  31, 2010; September 1, 2010 . By the 2012  campaigns,  however,  the  line  between  the  two had blurred. While there were still both  advertisements and public posts, campaigns’  pages  were  given  the  ability  to  ‘promote’   now  ‘boost’   individual  posts  to  audiences  that could be targeted based on user location,  age,  gender,  and  interests.  Social  platforms  like Facebook and Twitter have continued to  blur the line between advertising and content  by  allowing  campaigns  to  pay  to  promote  their posts to larger audiences and target the  populations  who  make  up  that  audience. At  the  same  time,  micro-targeting  has  become  even more common.  Mobilization efforts of all kinds, whether  they be geared toward fundraising, soliciting    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   533  volunteers  for  campaign  needs  or  getting  out the vote, now involve activities that take  place  both  on-  and  offline.  While  many  of  campaign’s most fundamental needs, such as  getting out the vote, still necessarily rely on  boots-on-the-ground  volunteers,  campaign  field operations have also radically expanded  the  amount  and  types  of  data  and  analytics  they rely on to know which doors to knock  on  and  which  hands  to  shake.  Similarly,  both  persuasive  and  mobilizing  messages  have benefitted from the increasingly precise  data used to identify and separate audiences  and  target  them  with  different,  pertinent  messages.  Campaigns  see  social  media  not  as  an  automatic  conduit  to  increasing  turnout  or  support, but as a way to increase the amount  and  depth  of  engagement  they  get  from  citizens.  Since  2010,  campaigns  have  been  concerned  with  getting  people  engaged  in  easily  enacted  forms  of  political  participa- tion, which they hoped would lead to greater  and  more  involved  forms  of  activism  later  on. This constant, escalating ask is known to  campaign and advocacy leaders as the ‘ladder  of engagement’, and is central to campaigns’  digital  strategy.  ‘Once  we  know  you’ll  sign  a petition, we can try to get you to forward  them to friends, or donate money. … So you  want  to  turn  people  who  are  on  your  email  list into donors and or volunteers; you want  to turn donors and or volunteers into super- volunteers.  It’s  a  constant  ask’   personal  communication,  May  20,  2011 .  Recent  research has supported the logic of this strat- egy,  showing  that  the  more  citizens  access  political  information  online  and  use  social  media  to  express  themselves  politically,  the  more likely they are to take subsequent, more  difficult  mediated  political  actions   Vaccari  et al., 2015 .  Another  major  effort  to  directly  combine  online  and  offline  mobilization  has  been  the  development  of  organizing  platforms  or  action  ‘hubs’  that  citizens  can  log  into,   keeping track of their own acts of participa- tion  and  sometimes  taking  action  directly.   These,  like  2008’s  MyBarackObama.com   known as MyBO  or Cruz’s Crew, the activ- ism app from the 2016 Republican presiden- tial  primary  candidate  Ted  Cruz,  not  only  gave campaigns data, but made participation  easy. While most campaigns below the presi- dential level lack the resources necessary to  develop fully-fledged original social activism  platforms, in 2012, top-tier campaigns began  to  enlist  the  services  of  consulting  firms  to  provide  the  same  tools.  More  often,  firms  would design campaigns’ official websites so  they had the look and feel of a platform – they  could  link  to  phone  banking  directions  or   volunteer signups – without needing to devote  time  to  the  complex  development  task  of  credentialing users with their own accounts.  During her first run for US Senate in 2012,  the  campaign  website  of  Elizabeth  Warren,  rising star of the Democratic Party, contained  an Action Center with nearly all of the same  options for action provided by BarackObama. com,  from  receiving  information  or  calling  others, to joining groups within the campaign  or attending events hosted by other citizens.  This workaround enabled smaller-scale cam- paigns to draw on the rhetorical and aesthetic  qualities  of  an  original  social  activism  plat- form  and  mobilize  citizens,  while  working  within  their  resource  constraints.  By  April  of  the  2016  primary  campaign,  with  help  from  tech-savvy  volunteers,  Senator  Bernie  Sanders’  campaign  had  not  only  developed  a  website  that  acted  similarly  to  an  action  hub  –  FeelTheBern.org  –  but  refined  home  phone  banking  technology,  enabling  volun- teers to make over 47 million calls from their  homes – on pace to surpass the Obama 2012  camapign’s  numbers  from  the  entire  elec- tion   Issenberg,  2016;  Scola,  2016 .  On  the  Republican side in 2015, the Cruz campaign  added  elements  of  gamification  –  points,  leaderboards, and badges – to its action hub   and mobile app  to further motivate users to  take  more  actions,  such  as  calling  potential  voters or tweeting about the candidate.  As studies have tried to measure the impact  of social media campaigning on persuasion,    534  mobilization, and general voter behavior, the  findings  have  been  inconclusive  at  best. At  the  most  basic  level,  despite  the  immense  amount of energy put into digital campaign  communications, these messages go largely  ignored  by  the  public   Nielsen  &  Vaccari,  2013 . When  they  are  attended  to,  no  rela- tionship  between  campaign  success  and  either overall number of followers or growth  in  followers  has  been  found   Dimitrova  &  Bystrom,  2013;  Vaccari  &  Nielsen,  2013 .  Despite  little  research  in  the  area,  early  analysis  of  what  kind  of  social  media  con- tent drives citizen participation shows people  are likely to engage with substantive issue- oriented posts  as measured by shares, likes,  and  comments ,  and  that  tone  and  timing  also  affect  this   Gerodimos  &  Justinussen,  2015; Xenos, Macafee, & Pole, 2015 . Such  findings  highlight  the  fact  that  digital  cam- paigning’s  benefit  is  unlikely  to  lie  in  its  ability to reach and persuade new voters, but  in its ability to mobilize, as was the case with  prior digital tools as well  Bimber & Davis,  2003 . At  the  same  time,  many  other  types  of  participation  are  increasing  as  well.  Not  only are people taking action online, but they  are also engaging in what Chadwick  2009   has  called  high-threshold  activities  –  can- vassing, presence at rallies, phone banking,   etc.  –  and  low-threshold  activities,  such  as  signing  petitions,  donating,  etc.   Vaccari  et  al.,  2015 .  The  use  of  digital  tools  to  upgrade or personalize traditional strategies,  such as using SMS text messages to get out  the  vote,  rather  than  emails,  mail  or  robo- calls,  have  been  shown  to  increase  turnout  by a handful of percentage points  Malhotra,  Michelson,  Rogers,  &  Valenzuela,  2011 .  Early data from the 2016 primaries indicate  that new digital engagement tools have facil- itated more political participation in the form  of  small  dollar  donations,  phone  banking  calls and voter contacts than in prior election  cycles  Scola, 2016 .  Overall,  as  adoption  of  social  media  has  become  nearly  ubiquitous,  both  the  subse- quent use of additional technologies and the   development of new communications strate- gies have followed. On the one hand, social  media  content  remains  largely  broadcast- oriented  and  relies  on  much  of  the  same  information  as  press  releases.  On  the  other  hand, this content is also different from that  of traditional mass media, as it is more posi- tive,  relies  on  photographs  and  infograph- ics,  and,  at  the  local  level,  also  tends  to  be  more oriented toward announcing and recap- ping events than focusing on issues. Broadly,  much of this content is concerned with mobi- lizing  supporters  rather  than  persuading  the  undecided.  Micro-targeting  ads  and  emails  have  enabled  campaigns  to  focus  on  per- suasion in these spaces, and simultaneously  allow for more efficient mobilization efforts.  These efforts, in turn, have been even more  supported  by  the  rise  in  proprietary  tools  like  action  hubs  and  mobile  apps  that  use  social elements to encourage people to take  action  over  time  and  away  from  campaign  headquarters.  The democratic implications for these new  forms of campaigning are much debated. On  the one hand, many have pointed to the use  of analytics and micro-targeting as a form of  controlling  or  managing  citizens   Howard,  2006;  Kreiss,  2012b .  Despite  these  very  real tendencies, others have argued that these  changes imply new views of how citizens are  organized  in  relation  to  one  another  and  to  political  institutions   Wells,  2015 ,  and  that  even actions that are managed by campaigns  can  act  as  openings  for  participatory  citi- zenship   Baldwin-Philippi,  2015 .  In  cases   where citizens are actively discussing politics  on social media platforms, there is increasing  concern  that  these  discussions  are  emblem- atic  of  polarization  rather  than  deliberation  and debate  Conover, Gonçalves, Flammini,  &  Menczer,  2012 ,  although  recent  work,  drawing  on  data  from  Germany,  Spain,  and  the  US,  shows  that  social  media  can  also  reduce  polarization   Barberá,  2015 .  Additionally,  digital  media  outreach  that  focuses on the less politically-interested and  less mobilized may be a potential answer to    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   535  polarization  by  mobilizing  those  with  tem- pered  perspectives   Prior  &  Stroud,  2015 .  While  this  chapter  does  not  focus  on  advo- cacy  campaigns,  they  offer  additional  rea- sons  to  be  optimistic  about  the  effects  of  digital  and  social  strategies.  Because  they  are  removed  from  electoral  time  constraints  and  the  zero-sum  stakes  of  winning losing  an  election,  advocacy  campaigns  are  better  equipped to engage citizens in digital organ- izing,  wherein  they  learn  activist  skills  and  facilitate the development and deepening of  political  social  networks.  This  form  of  net- worked activism not only leads to productive  structural changes to organizations that make  them  more  focused  on  participation   Karpf,  2012 ,  but  facilitates  actualized  citizenship   Bennett, 2008; Wells, 2015 . In all cases, the  optimistic  views  on  the  possibility  for  digi- tal  and  social  tools  to  improve  political  life  largely  rely  upon  participatory  and  interac- tive methods of engagement.  The unforeseen consequences  of adopTing digiTal sTraTegy  As campaigns adopt social media, they also  necessarily  encounter  new  forms  of  content  and  opportunities  for  political  communica- tion that cause them to question old ways of  doing things. This section examines three of  these instances of emerging campaign strate- gies that have resulted in unintended conse- quences. They are a product of human agency  and constraints of material technologies; they  are  driven  by  individual  and  organizational  decisions and platform interfaces that are dif- ficult   and  in  some  cases  impossible   to  change;  and,  taking  a  wider  view,  they  are  also  a  product  of  the  daily  decisions  cam- paign staffers make, and the larger economic  environment of US campaigning that is con- stantly short staffed and short on funds. This  section  first  discusses  the  changing  norms  surrounding  campaign  message  control  and  citizen  participation  and  discussion  in   campaign-supplied  public  forums   social  media,  commenting  sections,  etc. .  It  then  turns  toward  analysis  of  the  constraints  imposed  on  all  campaigns  by  their  use  of  publicly  available,  proprietary  platforms.  Finally, it discusses the emerging use of ana- lytics  in  campaigns,  and  the  limits  to  their  use in everyday campaigning.  Inviting Participation,   Losing Control  While  the  2008  campaign  was  dubbed  ‘the  Facebook  election,’  the  Facebook  that  the  Obama  and  McCain  campaigns  dealt  with  was a different version of Facebook than we  know today. The social norms and affordances  surrounding  commenting  had  yet  to  be  as  popular and user-friendly as they became in  the  following  six  years.  Sharing  content  among  friends,  for  instance,  was  neither  common  nor  made  particularly  easy  by  the  platform.  The  2008  Obama  campaign  did  deal with comments in its MySpace page, but  the population of users there was much fewer  in number than contemporary social media or  commenting sections, and therefore the risk  of allowing vitriolic comments  or those that  were  supportive,  but  inappropriate   was  not  as  great  as  it  is  now.  Within  Facebook,  the  number  of  user-generated  comments  grew  exponentially with each election cycle since  2008,  as  commenting  became  a  dominant  social  practice  on  the  platform.  In  2010,  a  candidate running for a close Senate race was  likely to receive one to two dozen comments  per  social  media  posts.  For  example,  Alexi  Giannoulias,  Democractic  candidate  for   the  Senate  in  Illinois  had  an  average  of   13.50  comments  per  post,  with  the  highest  numbers  coming  from  posts  specifically  requesting  comments.  Four  years  later,  a  comparably  competitive  Senatorial  race  in  New Hampshire resulted in hundreds of com- ments  per  post  for  both  Scott  Brown   Republican  and eventual winner, Jean Shaheen    Democrat . Even in 2010, campaigns began    536  to  see  the  strategic,  community-building  value of encouraging the public to comment  and hold discussions within their platforms.  To facilitate this, campaigns even encouraged  feedback,  asking  supporters  how  they  felt  about  issues,  for  feedback  on  advertising  spots,  and  polling  on  policy  questions   per- sonal communication, May 19, 2011 . While  campaigns had no intention of allowing feed- back to influence their strategic decisions or  issue  stances   or  even  that  they  would  have  time to comb through the answers , they saw  benefit in asking citizens to talk back.  Encouraging citizens to speak up and talk  back  to  campaigns  might  be  good  for  ide- als of deliberative democracy, but it posed a  problem  for  campaign  staffers  who  wanted  to  control  the  message.  While  campaigns  saw  that  deleting  citizens’  comments  on  their Facebook posts or blog comments was  dangerous  and  not  strategically  beneficial,  staffers  disagreed  on  how  else  they  should  shape user contributions. In 2010, Facebook  allowed  administrators  of  campaign  pages  to control whether people could make direct  posts to a candidate’s wall, who was able to  comment on the campaign’s post, and which  posts visitors would see first – posts by the  campaign,  the  campaign  and  the  public,  or  just  the  public.  As  social  media  platforms  offer  an  array  of  controls,  conversations  about  what  choices  to  make  have  divided  campaign  staffers  within  as  well  as  across  campaigns.  Exactly  how  much  control  was  the campaign willing to let go of, and what  leeway  should  the  public  be  given  in  their  commentary,  input,  and  criticism  of  cam- paigns? As  campaigns  developed  on-the-fly  answers to these questions, the new strategic  opportunities also exposed an unforeseen rift  between staffers.  Consultants  saw  opening  forums  like  commenting sections on Facebook and cam- paign blogs as beneficial not because of the  intrinsic  value  of  open,  democratic  spaces,  but  because  of  the  potential  downsides  of  closed spaces, and the consequences of being   perceived  as  untrustworthy  and  inauthentic.   One digital director stressed these downsides,  saying, ‘people would begin to hate that if you  [censored lots of content]. You don’t want to  do that. People will talk about that’  personal  communication, May 19, 2011 . Yet another  communication director described the back- lash  from  citizens  that  deletions  caused.  ‘They came back stronger, we learned not to  do  that  quickly’   personal  communication,  May 20, 2011 . Although fear of downsides  of  exerting  control  were  dominant,  some  staffers  –  largely  those  hired  into  newer  positions on Digital teams – also argued for  the  moral  value  of  leaving  platforms’  com- menting sections open and uncontrolled. As  one  digital  staffer  explained,  ‘I  come  from   the sort of generational culture, the tech cul- ture, whatever that believes in openness and  more  transparency’   personal  communica- tion, June 9, 2011 .  Such  disagreements  became  catalysts  for  organizational rifts between two of the major  players  within  campaigns:  Communications  and Digital teams. The digital director quoted  above  contrasted  his  view  specifically  with  that  of  his  Communications  counterparts,  adding:  ‘whereas  the  comms  shop  comes  from  the  opposite  culture:  “Don’t  say  any- thing unless you have to”’  personal commu- nication, June 9, 2011 . These disagreements  were  not  only  the  purview  of  local  cam- paigns, nor did they resolve themselves after  a  chaotic  2010  election;  the  2012  Obama  campaign was also plagued by them, despite  its widely lauded digital strategy. As detailed  in  post-campaign  journalistic  debriefs,  Obama’s digital team clashed with their com- munications counterparts over this very issue   Madrigal,  2013 .  Even  as  European  cam- paigns tend more toward the broadcast model  of communication within social media plat- forms, the fact that comments are becoming a  part of the social fabric of the platform itself  make this issue unavoidable. While stronger  norms  of  civility  and  deliberation  may  pro- vide Europeans with less of a threat to con- trol,  there  is  little  reason  to  think  they  will  not  deal  with  the  same  issues  and  navigate    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   537  the internal divisions those choices are likely  to reveal.  Inviting  participation  from  volunteers  eager to help campaigns also held the poten- tial for problems, even as they took action that  aided the campaign. As campaigns dealt with  the  problems  associated  with  relinquishing  control of their social media spaces, one pro- ductive  strategy  was  seeking  out  volunteers  to  take  on  opposition  in  public  forums  and  commenting spaces, sometimes going as far  as to call them ‘ambassadors’ and give them a  more meaningful, though symbolic, place in   the campaign  personal communication, March  4,  2011;  personal  communication,  June  22,  2011a .  Another  communications  director  described this as especially helpful if people  from  the  opposition  got  heavily  involved,  saying  ‘We’ll  immediately  go  into  full  recruit  mode  for  getting  more  of  our  like- minded  people  to  join  the  page  to  balance  it  out’   personal  communication,  June  22,  2011b . While these tactics were productive  and  saved  campaigns  time  responding,  they  also raised concerns of volunteers going off  message,  and  staffers’  anxiety  about  volun- teers staying on message were constant. Such  concern over well-meaning volunteers’ abil- ity to stay on message or allow campaigns to  control  engagement  tools  they  have  created  is not unfounded. In 2008, technically-savvy  and politically-active Obama supporters sup- plemented  the  campaign  with  grassroots-  created websites, social media posts, YouTube  videos and more. Although these efforts gen- erated  publicity,  showcased  the  dedication  and  enthusiasm,  and  held  the  potential  to  persuade and motivate voters, they also were  outside campaign control and thus causes of  concern  for  the  campaign  and  its  goals  of  ensuring a cohesive message. In May 2007,  the Obama campaign took over the MySpace  page for their candidate, much to the dismay  of the grassroots supporter, Joe Anthony, who  had run the page for two years. Following a  legal dispute over the page’s ownership, the  campaign was ultimately left with control of  the  official  page,  but  none  of  the  followers   Anthony had amassed  Sifry, 2007 . In 2016,  grassroots supporters of Senator Sanders had  similarly  created  organizing  websites,  such  as FeelTheBern.org, which links back to the  official  Sanders  campaign  site  to  facilitate  donations, volunteer efforts, and information  about  upcoming  Sanders  events,  but  is  not  affiliated with the campaign, or any support- ing PACs.  Public Platforms and   Changes to Interfaces  The landscape of digital tools that campaigns  can  enlist  is  overwhelming.  From  tools  to  procure  and  analyze  data  to  social  media  platforms that connect directly with potential  voters, campaigns can choose from a wealth  of  options  that  include  campaign-developed  proprietary  tools   e.g.,  My.BarackObama. com ,  purchasable,  off-the-shelf  software  packages  that  sometimes  also  include  con- sulting help  e.g., NationBuilder, CiviCRM,  Salsa  Labs,  etc. ,  or  publicly  available,  pri- vately-owned  platforms  like  Twitter,  Facebook and Wordpress. Increasingly, cam- paigns are paying for software to record and  organize data that will improve their persua- sion  and  mobilization  efforts,  but  popular  social  media  platforms  are  still  vital  to  all  campaigns  because  potential  voters  already  spend  time  within  these  spaces.  Moreover,  the  economic  realities  of  races  below  the  presidential level means that most campaigns  are  reliant  on  social  media  tools.  As  these  platforms are privately owned and controlled,  campaigns  are  unable  to  control  what  data,  controls, and affordances such platforms pro- vide them.  By now, the public is generally aware that  social media platforms use algorithms to fil- ter content and provide more relevant results  to  users   Gillespie,  2014,  as  well  as  in  this  volume . As  a  result,  campaign  consultants  often apply strategies to ‘game’ the algorithm  and make their posts visible to a higher num- ber  of  their  followers.  While  the  specifics    538  of  these  algorithms  are  proprietary,  some  variables  are  known  to  be  important,  ena- bling  consultants  and  staffers  to  learn  what  content  the  algorithm  is  known  to  reward.  With  every  major  change  in  the  algorithm  comes  a  flurry  of  concerns  and  discussions  on  consulting  listervs  and  trade  publica- tions, writing on how best to post content in  this  new  configuration. A  prominent  recent  example of this are the changes to Twitter’s  once-purely-chronological  algorithm.  First,  the  platform  added  content  ‘favorited’  by  others  to  a  users’  feed,  then  it  introduced  ‘Recaps’  or  ‘While  you  were  away’  –  an  algorithmically-curated  collection  of  tweets  the  user  is  likely  to  enjoy,  based  on  popu- larity  of  a  tweet,  the  account  tweeting,  and  the engagement between the user and other  accounts.  As  this  algorithmically  curated  part of Twitter became more widely distrib- uted  by  Twitter,  consultants  were  forced  to  consider  the  value  of  creating  content  that  will draw engagement versus constant tweet- ing  relevancy over recency . While we have  yet  to  see  how  campaigns  will  respond  to  this change, the very fact that campaigns are  reliant upon a privately owned platform and  not  in  control  of  its  affordances  highlights  the problem of unforeseen consequences of  social media adoption. More visible changes  to social media platforms can also ‘disrupt’  campaigns’ strategies and abilities, and force  them to change their practices.  In 2011, Facebook, for example, changed  its user interface from what had been a more  text-heavy  layout  that  highlighted  many  of  users’   and  friends’   posts  at  the  same  time  to  what  the  company  called  ‘Timeline,’  an  image-heavy  design.  This  change  did  more  than  just  move  all  users  into  an  interface  that afforded visual content; it changed cam- paigns’ ability to control where and if users  could  post  comments  and  information  on  official  campaign  pages.  Before  the  2011  change,  campaigns  could  choose  to  allow  users  to  post  on  their  page,  could  specify  whether  all  users  or  just  fans  could  do  so.  Moreover, if campaigns allowed fans or users   to  post,  they  could  also  choose  from  three  options of how visible those posts would be,  in  effect,  allowing  campaigns  to  discreetly  control  how  visible  citizen-created  content  would  be.  Campaigns  could  set  a  default  view to show only their own posts, those of  only  users,  or  all  posts.  Thus,  a  campaign  could  allow  anyone  to  post  content  to  their  own  page,  but  also  make  it  so  audiences  would  have  to  flip  through  a  filter  in  order  to see everyone’s posts. It could also prevent  users who were not fans from commenting on  other posts or creating their own post.  When  Facebook  made  its  change  to  the  Timeline layout in 2011, these options were  reduced. In this new layout, campaigns still  had  the  ability  to  limit  whether  users  could  post  directly  to  the  page,  including  limiting  whether  users  who  had  become  ‘fans’  or  ‘friends’ of the page could do so, or if anyone  could. However, campaigns lost the ability to  limit users’ comments on posts the campaign  published  themselves.  While  the  campaign  can  delete  or  hide  individual  comments,  there is no backend control of limiting com- ments in the first place; any post a campaign  makes is open to the public for commenting.  Additionally, the design of the Timeline lay- out  meant  that  campaign-produced  content  was front and center, while visitors’ or fans’  posts were relegated to a side column. Thus  the  change  allowed  campaigns  to  highlight  their  own  content,  but  simultaneously  pro- hibited  campaigns  from  exerting  a  type  of  discreet  control  over  the  comments  on  that  content.  Limits to Data and Analytics  Data and analytics have long been useful and  necessary  aspects  of  campaigning,  from  the  use  of  local  and  national  polls  to  gauge  public opinion to dial tests used to measure  reception  of  particular  messages  or  argu- ments,  to  the  micro-targeting  practices   discussed  previously.  While  these  uses  of  data  to  craft  persuasive  messages  are    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   539  commonplace,  in  the  years  following  the  2008 presidential election, discussions of the  importance of ‘data-driven campaigning’ and  the importance of a ‘culture of analytics’ have  gained traction among political professionals  working  in  both  advocacy  and  campaign  environments.  In  many  ways,  communica- tions offices have made leaps and bounds in  the  time  between  2010  and  2014.  In  2010,  campaigns were only on the cusp of making  sense  of  the  new  digital  tools  at  their  dis- posal.  Campaigns  rarely  used  analytics  to  test  messages  or  develop  strategy,  and  they  were struggling with the basics, such as how  to  increase  circulation  in  new  social  media  spaces  or  reach  desired  populations.  In  one  example,  a  communications  director  of  a  major  Congressional  campaign  found  him- self confused and frustrated upon seeing that  he  could  not  target  direct  messages  to  citi- zens because he incorrectly assumed that the  affordances  of  Facebook  advertisements  could be used for public posts and messages  as well  Fieldnotes, September 1, 2010 . As a  result of this inability to target messages, he  questioned the usefulness of the entire plat- form.  Another  Chicago-area  campaign  that  was  in  an  extremely  tight  race  described  being  so  concerned  with  gaining  Facebook  friends  that  a  member  of  the  communica- tions digital  team  purchased  additional  friends.  This  strategy  held  many  problems,  not  least  of  all  that  it  failed  to  reach  actual  voters,  and  staffers  had  to  subsequently  spend additional hours manually deleting the  campaign’s  Facebook  page  of  fake  friends   personal communication, March 27, 2011 .  Here, social media benchmarks that seemed  important  to  campaigns  directly  impeded  other strategic goals.  Even in 2010, those in federal races were  using  targeted  email  lists,  and  occasionally  deployed  an  A B  test  for  special  occasions  or initial website development. In one case,  a  campaign  tested  three  options  to  deter- mine  the  content  of  a  splash  page  that  pre- ceded the campaign website during the final  two  weeks  of  the  campaign,  but  that  was   their only A B test of the final month of the  campaign   Fieldnotes,  October  18,  2010 .  Generally,  communications  directors  for  Senate  and  Congressional  campaigns  were  well versed in targeting email lists, but only  those  at  the  Senate  level  were  testing  those  messages in order to determine what type of  subject header, content, and images were best  at gaining attention or mobilizing constituen- cies  Baldwin-Philippi, 2016 .  Much has happened since 2010 – analytics   are  increasingly  automated,  or  ‘baked  in,’  and  displayed  to  the  messages’  creators  with clarity, simplicity, and aesthetic appeal.  Without  much  effort,  staffers  can  use  email  management  systems  to  catalog  what  audi- ences do with the messages, collecting data  on  whether  an  email  was  opened,  if  it  was  shared  in  other  social  media  spaces,  and or  what  links  were  clicked.  Likewise,  domain  hosts  and  free  analytics  provide  basic  web  traffic  data  for  campaign  websites  that  also  tells  campaigns  where  visitors  are  located,  and what linked them to the site. Campaigns  gravitate toward these tools, even if they are  not  always  deployed  in  statistically  rigor- ous  ways,  largely  because  they  are  easy  to  access and interpret. Because time is always  of the essence in a campaign, data that update  immediately  and  can  be  quickly  interpreted  are  of  great  benefit.  One  communication  consultant explained how baked-in analytics  are the most practical in the time crunch of a  campaign, saying, ‘I don’t have to take time  to set something up before posting a message  […] I can look at the numbers when I have  the time, and still use that [finding] the next  time  we  need  to  post  a  message’   personal  communication, December 3, 2014 . Others  echoed  the  benefit  of  their  immediate  pres- ence  and  the  obvious  usefulness,  with  one  noting ‘They’re right there! You can just take  a quick look and see what type of messages  perform  well’   personal  communication,  December 18, 2014 .  Notably, these analytics focus on popular- ity,  highlighting  the  amount  of  impressions  content  makes,  how  many  times  it  is  liked    540  or favorited, and how often it is shared about  other metrics. Visually, the native analytics of  Facebook  overwhelmingly  emphasize  these  very measures. In each of these, the number  of  likes,  the  reach   total  impressions ,  and  ‘engagement’  a combination of likes, com- ments,  shares,  and  how  many  times  links  are  clicked   are  provided.  These  engage- ment  analytics  begin  to  provide  insight  that  is deeper than popularity of topics or issues,  but also require more advanced strategies in  combination with other forms of analytics to  understand  if  other  actions,  such  as  donat- ing or signing up for a newsletter, are taken.  Facebook highlights notifications specifically  for likes and shares and bar graphs that visu- ally represent the amount of people reached.  While  it  also  measures  additional  actions  such as engagement, or if audiences click on  links provided, the system itself cannot track  analytics  of  more  action-oriented  behavior,  such  as  which  users  donate  once  a  link  is  clicked, or how long they stay on that page.  Twitter,  on  the  other  hand,  provides  people  with  an  overview  that  is  more  concerned  with how the campaign as a whole is doing,  highlighting how well tweets are doing over  multiple weeks, rather than only focusing on  particular  messages. Although  retweets  and  favoriting mirror the drive for popularity seen  in  Facebook’s  analytics,  Twitter’s  engage- ment metric is a sum of all replies, retweets,  and mentions, and speaks more to how much  a campaign is being discussed by the public  of users than merely what type of content is  popular.  While  Twitter  provides  data  on  a  user’s audience through a ‘followers’ section  of their analytics, that information is a click  deeper  than  analytics  displaying  an  account  and individual tweet’s impressions, retweets,  favorites, or an account’s mentions.  Just as the material constraints of privately- owned platforms impacted campaigns’ abil- ity to control and sensor public commentary,  they  also  constrain  campaigns’  ability  to  work with analytics. The data that platforms  like Facebook and Twitter automatically pro- vide to users – especially the data that they   choose  to  visually  represent  and  make  the  most  easily  interpretable  –  will  be  the  data  that  campaigns  turn  to,  and  that  therefore  drives content creation. Popular social media  analytics  packages  such  as  SproutSocial,  CrowdTangle,  Attentive.ly,  and  so  on,  pro- vide more complex metrics of ‘engagement’  than those baked into social media platforms  themselves, like Facebook Insights. In these  third-party  tools,  algorithms  rank  combi- nations  of  measures  such  as  likes,  shares,  attention,  users’  networks,  and  so  on,  and  sometimes compare them with other similar  pages. These  uses  of  analytics  are  certainly  an important beginning step into testing mes- sages  and  engaging  analytics  more  rigor- ously, but their limited use results in attention  to  the  type  of  content  that  encourage  cam- paigns to focus on messages that are popular,  rather than mobilizing.  implicaTions and conclusion  Campaigns’ use of social media was solidi- fied  in  the  wake  of  the  2008  Obama  cam- paign, and this use has continued to increase  in  the  international  context.  Currently,  the  parliamentary context breeds widespread use  of social media by party accounts, approach- ing  that  of  candidates  in  the  US  case,  and  individual politicians’ are increasingly turn- ing  toward  social  media  campaigning.  Although  most  campaigns’  and  parties’  use  of  social  media  involves  the  unidirectional  broadcasting  of  messages,  there  is  also  a  substantial  minority  of  campaign  strategy  designed  specifically  around  using  social  media  to  mobilize  individuals  to  take  both  online  and  offline  action.  Beyond  the  tradi- tional mobilization-oriented campaign goals  of  increasing  voter  turnout,  fundraising,  attendance at campaign events, a new goal of  getting  supporters  to  participate  in  online  discussions  and  deliberations  has  also  emerged. Overall, early research gives reason  to  be  hopeful  that  engagement  with    PolitiCs 2.0: soCial Media CaMPaigning   541  campaigns  on  social  media  leads  to  further,  deeper  political  action  as  well.  However,  social media do not provide unmitigated aid  to campaigns; as this this chapter points out,  there  are  often  unintended  consequences  to  adoption.  This  chapter  points  to  three  such  instances  of  unintended  consequences  of  social media adoption:  1  the rise of citizens  who talk back and loss of campaign message  control;   2   the  decision  to  use  privately-  created platforms such as Twitter and Facebook,  even when necessary, limits campaigns’ ability  to  control  messages  and  understand  data;   3   the difficulties posed by the drive toward data  and analytics and the default options that cam- paigns gravitate toward.  This  assessment  of  unforeseen  conse- quences  serves  as  neither  an  optimistic  nor  pessimistic assessment of the future of cam- paign communication and digital democracy.  Rather,  it  points  to  the  possibility  of  both.  Sometimes, as was the case with campaigns’  unraveling ability to control public feedback,  actions taken by staffers and changes in cam- paign  technology  lead  to  a  rupture  in  the  tight  control  campaigns  have  long  wielded  over citizens. What campaigns see as a loss  of control is, to citizens, a space that is open  and encourages them to voice their opinions,  provide support  and dissent  for policies and  candidates,  and  give  feedback  on  political  information. It is true that the content of this  feedback may not reach the high standards of  reasoned,  rational,  and  consensus-oriented  debate  that  are  indicative  of  deliberative  democracy.  That  said,  deliberation  is  not  the only democratic ideal that can be gained  from speaking on political issues. The act of  giving  voice  to  political  beliefs  and  stances  via social media necessarily involves engag- ing others in your social network in political  speech and information, and is itself partici- patory, and part of the ladder of engagement.  Even as some campaign staffers have found  such spaces dangerous and desired to reduce  their  availability,  campaigns’  decisions  to  engage  with  citizens  via  the  popular  social  media  platforms  of  Facebook  and  Twitter   have  left  them  hamstrung.  We  can  surely  consider  ways  to  improve  the  potential  for  voice-giving in these spaces, but the particu- lar  platforms  of  Facebook  and Twitter  have  forced  campaigns  to  deal  with  –  and  even  encourage – citizens’ voices in ways that are  unparalleled.  Other campaign strategies offer less room  for optimism. As campaigns routinely turn to  social media platforms, they also embrace the  analytics that the platforms provide in order  to  assess  how  successful  the  content  they  create has been, and anticipate what content  will be successful in the future. Many of the  ways campaigns use this data – especially at  the level of local and state-wide campaigns –   incentivize  simplistic  views  of  campaign  goals that also motivate a turn toward super- ficial  forms  of  democratic  engagement.   As  these  analytics  highlight  popularity  –  how  many  individuals  a  message  reaches,  how many likes, favorites, or shares it gets,  the  number  of  comments  rather  than  their  content, and so on – social media platforms  motivate the production of content that will  bring popularity, rather than alternative, more  participatory  options,  such  as  mobilizing  citizens  or  identifying  new  opinion  leaders.  While  creating  popular  content  could  moti- vate supporters to deepen their commitment,  the  fact  that  these  metrics  do  not  highlight  or provide clear, legible data on such effects  limits campaigns’ ability to see mobilization  as a tangible outcome of social media mes- saging.  Further,  because  popular  content  is  not always that which is the most successful  at persuading or mobilizing particular acts of  political  participation  like  donating,  volun- teering, or turning out at events, what counts  as visible ‘success’ within the world of social  media content may not be the most important  to campaigns’ immediate needs.  consequences   These  unforeseen   are  occurring as social media platforms play an  increasingly widespread role in campaigns –   popular standards like Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube are now near-ubiquitous. Campaigns  experiment with emergent platforms such as     542  Snapchat  and  Periscope  and  even  their  own  mobile  applications;  more  time,  money  and  staffers are devoted to the messages produced  for  and  circulated  within  and  across  social  media platforms. As these tools continue to be  important sites of engagement for campaigns,  inspection of their ability to affect the types  of  participation  allowed  and  encouraged  is  necessary. This chapter is not meant to slow  the adoption of social media campaigning –   not  only  will  campaigns  continue  to  rush  toward and even develop new tools that might  give them the slightest edge, but I am gener- ally hopeful for the democratic opportunities  offered  by  the  vast  majority  of  such  tools.  Instead, this is a call for consideration of the  strategic choices campaigns might be making  in the moment and for deeper attention to the  long-term consequences of technology adop- tion and strategy development. This is espe- cially important as international campaigning  may be driven to catch up with the US cases  that currently drive most innovation, and as  US campaigns continue to develop new tools  that will be improved, adopted, and deployed  in campaign cycles to come.  Notes   1   Many  have  written  accounts  of  the  history  and  evolution of these aspects of campaigning, which  are due far more consideration than this chapter  is  able  to  give.

Millions  of  social  media  users  have  become involved in the rapid and widespread  production and circulation of activist materi- als,  including  everything  from  protest  hashtags,  second-hand  rumours  and  photo- shopped  images,  to  first-hand  eyewitness  reports  and  video  evidence.  In  January  and  February  2011,  the  opposition  against  the  dictatorial  regimes  in  Tunisia  and  Egypt  especially used Facebook and text messaging  to share reports on the events in the streets,  while Twitter played a vital role in the trans- national communication on these revolutions   Bruns et al., 2013; Lim, 2012; Lotan et al.,  2011; Tufekci & Wilson, 2012 . Inspired by  the Arab Spring, large protests subsequently  erupted in Spain, the US, and Italy during the  summer and fall of 2011. Again major social  media platforms were used for mobilization  and communication purposes  Castells, 2012;    Gerbaudo,  2012 .  And  in  following  years,  similar spikes in social media activity could  be observed during protests in Turkey, Hong  Kong,  Brazil,  and  other  countries   Göle,  2013;  Kuymulu,  2013;  Lee  &  Chan,  2016;  Saad-Filho, 2013 .  This  chapter  discusses  how  the  intensive  use of social media transforms the organiza- tion and communication of protest. The start- ing  point  of  this  discussion  is  the  idea  that  traditional  modes  of  organization  in  social  movements   with  structural  features  like  identifiable  leaders  and  persistent  collective  identities  have been largely replaced by more  distributed  and  emergent  mass  user  activity  enabled  by  social  media  platforms   Bennett  & Segerberg, 2013; Castells, 2012; Margetts  et al., 2016 . We will show how this argument  has  been  questioned  and  complicated  from  two angles. First, through detailed studies on  social  media  protest  practices,  researchers  have  demonstrated  that  leadership  and  col- lective identities continue to play a vital role  in  online  contention.  Second,  based  on  the    soCial Media and new Protest MoveMents   547  exploration of the techno-commercial archi- tecture  of  social  media,  it  has  been  argued  that these platforms not only enable activist  social media activity, but also fundamentally  shape it.  Reviewing these arguments, we will com- bine insights from different fields of research.  We not only build on social movement stud- ies,  but  also  on  work  in  political  communi- cation,  platform  and  software  studies,  and  political  economy.  Furthermore,  we  profit  from  a  wide  range  of  available  case  studies  on protest and social media, which have been  published over the past years. These studies  trace in detail how social media protest prac- tices  have  taken  shape  in  different  parts  of  the world. In turn, this allowed us to develop  a  nuanced  understanding  of  how  social  media  platforms  become  involved  in  pro- test. Finally, we build on our own research,  especially  using  material  from  case  stud- ies  on  social  media  communication  during  the  2011  Egyptian  and  Tunisian  uprisings,  which many scholars consider as the start of  the  current  wave  of  popular  protests   Poell  et al., 2016; Poell & Darmoni, 2012 . We also  draw from an earlier inquiry into the techno-  commercial  shaping  of  social  media  protest  activity  Poell & van Dijck, 2015 .  a neW mode of proTesT  Reflecting  on  recent  protests  and  uprisings,  various  scholars,  most  prominently  Castells   2012 , Bennett and Segerberg  2012, 2013 ,  and  Margetts  et  al.   2016 ,  have  proposed  that social media user activity is at the heart  of a fundamental transformation of activism.  These  theorists  see  social  media  platforms  enabling  more  bottom-up,  distributed  forms  of  protest  mobilization,  organization,  and  communication. It is important to emphasize  that  none  of  these  authors  considers  social  media activity in isolation or gives this activ- ity  primacy  over  ‘offline’  protest  practices.  In fact, as much current research shows, the   distinction between the ‘online’ and ‘offline’  can no longer be made. Since many protes- tors carry smartphones and have continuous  access to online platforms to share their con- tent and observations, protest simultaneously  unfolds on the ground and online. Thus, the  key  question  is  not  whether  the  activity  on  social  media  is  more  important  than  street  protests,  or  whether  the  rise  of  these  media   is somehow the ‘cause’ of popular uprisings,  as  was  suggested  by  some  of  the  press  reports  on  the  2011  Arab  Spring  protests.  Instead, the question is how the widespread  use  of  social  media  platforms  affects  the  organization and communication of contem- porary protest  Shea et al., 2015 .  Responding  to  this  question,  Castells  argues  in  Networks  of  Outrage  and  Hope   2012:  232   that  today’s  protest  movements  should be seen in the context of a ‘culture of  sharing’, enabled by social networking sites  and the internet more generally. In this cul- ture,  people  construct  horizontal  networks  that  simultaneously  take  shape  locally  on  streets  and  squares  and  globally  on  social  media platforms. For Castells, these networks  transform  the  dynamic  of  activism,  as  they  support  ‘cooperation  and  solidarity  while  undermining the need for formal leadership’   2012: 225 . Crucially, they ‘create together- ness’, which allows people to ‘overcome fear  and  discover  hope’.  This  togetherness  does  not, however, constitute community, because  ‘community implies a set of common values’,  whereas ‘most people come to the movement  with their own motivations and goals’  ibid. .  Thus,  following  Castells,  new  social  move- ments  revolve  around  both  solidarity  and  individuality.  Lance  Bennett  and  Alexandra  Segerberg   2012, 2013  have articulated the most devel- oped  theory  of  how  social  media  sharing  practices transform the dynamic of activism.  They  maintain  that  new  protest  movements  are driven by ‘the self-motivated  though not  necessarily self-centered  sharing of already  internalized  or  personalized  ideas,  plans,  images,  and  resources  with  networks  of    548  others’  2012: 753 . Sharing activist content  becomes self-motivated because it is a form  of ‘personal expression’ and ‘self-validation’   2012: 752–753 . The mass sharing of ‘per- sonal action frames’ facilitates, according to  Bennett and Segerberg, a new type of action,  which  they  label  ‘connective  action’   2012:  744 . From this point of view, the communi- cation  process  itself  provides  key  organiza- tional resources, allowing large crowds to act  together with little need for prominent lead- ers,  formal  social  movement  organizations,  and  collective  action  frames,  which  require  individuals  to  share  common  identities  and  political claims  2012: 747 .  The latest major contribution to the argu- ment  that  social  media  enable  bottom-up,  distributed  forms  of  mass  protest  has  been  made by Margetts et al.  2016 . On the basis  of large-scale data analysis of contemporary  protest  events,  they  come  to  the  conclusion  that ‘social media extend the range of politi- cal activities that citizen can undertake, low- ering  the  cost  to  an  extent  whereby  people   are  offered  the  opportunity  to  make  micro- donations  of  time  and  effort  to  political  causes’   2016:  196–197 .  As  such,  social  media  platforms  provide  what  the  authors  call  ‘zero-touch  coordination’  for  micro- donations,  altering  the  costs  and  benefits  of  political  actions   2016:  199 .  While  micro- donations might seem insignificant, Margetts  and  colleagues  emphasize  that  they  are  politically  of  great  importance,  as  they  can  and occasionally do scale up to mass mobi- lizations. The authors label this new mode of  popular contention ‘chaotic pluralism’, which  constitutes an individualization of collective  action, and ‘injects turbulence into every area  of  politics,  acting  as  an  unruly,  unpredicat- able influence on political life’  2016: 200 .  These theories on how social media enable  distributed  forms  of  protest  mobilization,  organization,  and  communication  have  had  a lot of impact on current scholarship. Many  case  studies  on  particular  protests  build  on  them,  citing  similar  observations   see,  for  example, Anduiza et al., 2014; Caraway, 2016;    Dessewffy  &  Nagy,  2016;  Lim,  2013;  Wright, 2015 . At the same time, as discussed  in the following sections, a growing number  of studies question some of the key assump- tions underpinning these theories. By staging  a  debate  between  the  different  interpreta- tions of the role of social media platforms in  contemporary  protest,  we  gain  a  more  pre- cise understanding of both the intricacies of  social media protest practices and the techno- commercial  infrastructures  through  which  such  practices  are  articulated.  We  will  start  by looking at the question of leadership and  collective identity.  leadership and collecTiviTy  Whereas the theorists discussed above exam- ine how social media platforms enable mass  self-organization  and  self-communication  by  individuals,  various  other  scholars  observe the emergence of new forms of hier- archy  and  leadership.  Research  on  transna- tional  social  media  communication  during  the  Tunisian  and  Egyptian  uprisings,  for  example, shows that prominent users, mostly  activists, bloggers, and journalists, deployed  carefully  planned  tactics.  These  tactics  included  promoting  particular  hashtags  and  accounts, and collecting protest information  from  Facebook  and  on-the-ground  social  networks;  it  also  involved  translating,  dis- tributing,  and  curating  this  information  on  Twitter, YouTube,  and  various  independent  blogs.  In  these  translation  and  distribution  efforts,  core  users  strategically  employed  different  languages,  most  prominently  Arabic, English, and French, to address pub- lics ranging from Arab youth to international  news media  Della Ratta & Valeriani, 2014;  Lotan et al., 2011; Papacharissi, 2015; Poell &   Darmoni, 2012 .  Such  protest  tactics  were  not  just  used  on  social  media  platforms,  but  also  on  the  streets.  Research  on  the  build-up  to  the  Egyptian uprising demonstrates how leading    soCial Media and new Protest MoveMents   549  activists  from  different  protest  networks,  loosely organized through social media plat- forms, distributed tens of thousands of flyers,  circulated  calls  for  mobilization  in  public  transport,  and  organized  feeder  marches  in  the  working-class  neighborhoods  of  Cairo   Gerbaudo,  2012;  Lim,  2012 .  Crucially,  most  of  these  mobilization  tactics  were  not  invented  on  the  spot,  but  developed  in  the  years  before  the  uprising  in  transnational  activist networks, facilitated by international  NGOs  Aneja, 2011; Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;  Tufekci & Wilson, 2012 .  These examples suggest that, even though  formal  social  movement  organizations  were  mostly absent in the mobilization of the Arab  Spring uprisings, strategizing and leadership  were  still  essential  to  protest  organization  and  communication.  Small  groups  of  activ- ists,  centrally  positioned  in  social  media- facilitated  networks,  fulfilled  many  of  the  functions traditionally associated with social  movement leaders, that is: strategically fram- ing protest activity and connecting previously  separate  individuals  and  groups  in  com- mon  action.  Furthermore,  these  actors  were  essential  in  so-called  information  politics:  translating,  diffusing,  and  curating  protest  information  Della Ratta & Valeriani, 2014;  Poell et al., 2016; Tremayne, 2014; Tufekci,  2013 .  Reflecting  on  these  practices,  Della  Ratta and Valeriani  2014  have labeled these  top  social  media  users  as  ‘connective  lead- ers’: leaders who are focused on connecting  people and information.  Although  such  connective  leaders  ful- fill  many  functions  traditionally  associated  with  social  movement  leaders,  theirs  is  a  fundamentally  different  type  of  leadership.  Some  of  the  key  characteristics  of  connec- tive leadership in a social media environment  can  be  identified  by  examining  the  interac- tions between administrators and users of the  Egyptian ‘Kullena Khaled Said’  We are all  Khaled Said  Facebook page. This page was  created  in  June  2010  by  Wael  Ghonim,  the  Dubai-based  head  of  marketing  for  Google  Middle East and North Africa. He developed   the page, in close collaboration with journal- ist  and  activist  AbdelRahman  Mansour,  to  protest the murder of Khaled Said, a young  middle-class Egyptian man from Alexandria  who was beaten to death by Egyptian security  forces   Ghonim,  2012 .  The  page  received  250,000  likes  during  its  first  three  months  and  rapidly  developed  into  a  stage  where  users  shared  grievances  about  the  Mubarak  regime   Lesch,  2011;  Lim,  2012 .  Having  initiated  and  guided  this  process  of  online  contention,  Ghonim  and  Mansour  can  be  considered  prominent  examples  of  connec- tive leaders  for the full discussion, see Poell  et al., 2016 .  Examining the activities of the two admin- istrators in detail, it is striking how hard they  tried to remain anonymous and not be labeled  as  activist  leaders.  This  corresponds  with  a  more  general  trend  in  contemporary  activ- ism.  In  contrast  to  social  movement  leaders  of previous decades, some of which figured  prominently in the mass media, most leading  actors  in  social  media  protest  communica- tion  do  not  want  to  be  publicly  recognized  as  leaders   Coleman,  2014 .  With  varying  measures of success, such actors have tried to  remain out of the limelight. They do so partly  for security reasons – certainly a major con- cern  of  Ghonim  and  Mansour  –  but  also  to  maintain the image of a spontaneous people’s  movement.  By  presenting  their  movements  as  bottom-up,  contemporary  protestors  seek  to transcend traditional political alignments.  Making  protest  leaders  publicly  visible  would  undermine  this  narrative.  This  even  applies to leading social media users in trans- national  protest  communication,  some  of  whom have developed into so-called micro- celebrities.  As  Tufekci   2013:  868   points  out,  ‘the  networked  microcelebrity  activist’  remains  an  integral  part  of  protest  move- ments.  As  she  writes,  ‘Without  necessarily  an institutional role or a claim to legitimacy  through established, institutionalized means,  the  activist’s  position  within  the  movement  remains that of a peer whose political acts are  visible and can be challenged from within the    550  Furthermore,   movement’   ibid. .  This  is  in  clear  contrast  to social movement leaders of the past who  became  mass  media  celebrities,  such  as  the  leaders of the Civil Rights Movement or the  anti-war movement in the US  Gitlin, 1980 . the  analysis  of  Kullena  Khaled  Said  suggests  that  connective  lead- ership revolves around inviting, connecting,  steering, and stimulating, rather than direct- ing,  commanding,  and  proclaiming.  Instead  of recruiting members willing to ‘follow’, as  social  movements  have  historically  sought  to  do,  Ghonim  and  Mansour  explicitly  cul- tivated  the  page  to  be  ‘participatory’.  The  admins  actively  invited  user  contributions,  which informed further initiatives and activi- ties  developed  through  the  page.  A  prime  example  of  this  was  a  call  to  users  to  pho- tograph themselves holding up the ‘Kullena  Khaled Said’ sign, a tactic which was, a year  later, replicated on a much larger scale dur- ing  the  Occupy  protests  with  the  ‘We  are  the  99%’  slogan   Gerbaudo,  2015;  Milan,  2015a .  Moreover,  Ghonim  and  Mansour  regularly held polls to determine what further  activities the users were interested in devel- oping through the page. More generally, the  admins  systematically  read  user  comments  to  be  able  to  adequately  respond  to  user  feedback. Thus,  active  user  engagement,  as  enabled by social media, does not contradict  the  exercise  of  leadership,  or  make  leader- ship  obsolete.  Instead,  triggering,  shaping,  and incorporating user contributions are part  and parcel of how this type of leadership is  exercised.  Although  connective   leaders  facilitate  and  steer  the  participation  of  social  media  users  in  protest  communication  and  mobi- lization,  this  type  of  leadership  is  certainly  not  without  its  problems.  First,  connec- tive  leaders  command  little,  if  any,  loyalty  because  they  do  not  and  cannot  publicly  identify themselves as leaders. And given the  completely  open  character  of  social  media  communication,  their  activities  can  also  be  easily monitored and undermined by authori- ties.  This  became  very  clear  on  the  Khaled   Said  page  when  supporters  of  the  Mubarak  regime effectively hijacked the communica- tion on the page from the moment the mass  protests  started  on  January  25,  2011.  With  newly created Facebook accounts, these sup- porters  began  spreading  false  rumors  and  accusing the administrators of being foreign  agents,  secretly  working  for  Israel.  Second,  as  Gerbaudo   2017   has  demonstrated,  the  contradiction  between  leadership  in  social  media protest communication and the ideol- ogy  of  horizontality  and  leaderlessness  that  characterizes  new  protest  movements  often  leads to conflicts among connective leaders.  Examining the small teams that managed the  Twitter,  Facebook,  Tumblr,  and  Livestream  accounts  of  Occupy  Wall  Street  in  the  US,  the  Spanish  Indignados,  and  the  UK  Uncut  movements, he observes that ‘disputes about  the  management  of  activist  power  accounts  have  seen  competing  factions  fighting  to  secure control over these assets, with activ- ists  engaging  in  the  banning  of  rivals,  and  in  mutual  accusations  of  “hi-jacking”  col- lective resources’  Gerbaudo, 2017: 11 . He  maintains that such conflicts, which occur in  virtually  every  major  contemporary  protest  movement,  significantly  undermine  these  movements and hasten their decline.  These tensions point towards a fundamen- tal dilemma facing the leadership of today’s  social movements. As Melluci  1996  already  pointed out 20 years ago, to ensure the sur- vival  of  social  movements  particular  tasks,  which require some form of leadership, have  to be fulfilled. At the same time, in the cur- rent  cultural  setting  of  individualization  and  rejection  of  hierarchy,  it  is  impossible  to  make  leadership  explicit,  as  this  would  lead  to  the  breakdown  of  the  ‘interpersonal  rela- tions’  and  ‘solidarity’  on  which  movements  are built  1996: 345 . According to Melucci,  movements  try  to  resolve  this  dilemma  by  minimizing and concealing decision-making  and representative functions  ibid. . This strat- egy  can  clearly  be  observed  in  the  attempts  by connective leaders in social media protest  communication  to  remain  anonymous,  or  at    soCial Media and new Protest MoveMents   551  least  refrain  from  identifying  themselves  as  leaders. Accordingly, today’s movements pre- sent  themselves  as  the  ‘people’,  as  ‘we’  the  ‘99%’. Evidently, these strategies don’t per- manently revolve the dilemma, as leadership  functions  continue  to  be  exercised,  even  in  highly distributed forms of social media pro- test communication. Any time these functions  become explicit, conflicts are likely to occur. While  this  analysis  of  the  articulation  of  leadership doesn’t invalidate arguments about  connective  action,  micro-donations,  and  a  culture  of  sharing,  it  does  complicate  these  ideas.  The  challenge  for  researchers  study- ing  contemporary  protest  communication,  mobilization,  and  coordination  is  not  just  to  explore  how  these  processes  take  shape  through distributed user practices, but also to  trace how these practices are steered through  new  forms  of  leadership.  Examining  these  relationships, it is important to see that activ- ist leadership and social media protest activ- ity are not necessarily contradictory, but can  be mutually reinforcing.  Collectivity  The  second  major  question  is  whether  col- lectivity  still  plays  a  key  role  in  today’s  protest movements. Castells  2012  suggests  that most people join social movements with  their  own  motivations  and  goals.  And  Bennett  and  Segerberg   2012   argue  that  connective  action  does  not  revolve  around  ‘collective  action  frames’,  which  require  negotiating  common  interpretations  of  col- lective identities. Instead, connective action  is  driven  by  the  rapid  sharing  of  personal  action  frames  through  social  media  plat- forms. Various other researchers have, how- ever,  begun  to  question  this  interpretation,  arguing that a ‘collective sense of self’ does  emerge  in  the  mass  sharing  of  protest  slo- gans  and  materials  on  social  media  plat- forms.  This  collective  sense  of  self  can  be  understood  as  a  manifestation  of  collective  identity  Bakardjieva, 2015; Coretti & Pica,   2015; Gerbaudo, 2015; Kavada, 2015, 2016;  Monterde et al., 2015 .  Recognizing that social media protest com- munication  has  a  vital  ‘affective’  or  ‘emo- tional’ dimension is an important step towards  identifying collectivity. Mass protest, as Juris   2008: 63  emphasizes, produces through its  ‘highly  unpredictable  and  confrontational  nature  …  powerful  affective  ties’.  Such  ties  are especially crucial ‘within fluid, network- based movements that rely on non-traditional  modes  of  identification  and  commitment’   ibid. .  In  the  absence  of  social  movement  organizations to provide stability, it becomes  difficult, as Juris  2008  makes clear, to sus- tain  a  mobilization  process  without  strong  affective ties. This suggests that the ‘personal  action  frames’  highlighted  by  Bennett  and  Segerberg   2012   are  not  sufficient  to  bring  together large protesting masses.  Studying  protest  mobilization  on  social  media  platforms,  various  scholars  have  indeed  observed  instances  in  which  power- ful  affective  appeals  were  made  to  larger  collectives.  For  example,  in  their  explora- tion  of  Twitter  communication  during  the  2011  Egyptian  uprising,  Papacharissi  and  de  Fatima  Oliveira   2012:  275   detected  ‘overwhelming  expressions  of  solidarity’  in  the  stream  of  news  reports.  In  fact,  it  ‘became  difficult  to  separate  factual  reports  from  expressions  of  camaraderie’   ibid. .  Gerbaudo  2016: 256 , in turn, makes similar  observations in his analysis of the interaction  on large Facebook pages central to the 2011  Egyptian  and  Spanish  protest  movements.  In  the  mass  interaction  on  these  pages,  he  noticed  ‘moments  of  digital  enthusiasm’,  ‘in which the emotions of thousands of Web  users fuse into a collective sense of possibil- ity’. Acting as connective leaders, the admin- istrators of these pages played a key role in  boosting  enthusiasm  by  producing  ‘hopeful  narratives’,  which  set  in  motion  processes  of ‘emotional contagion’ as users reinforced  these narratives  Gerbaudo, 2016: 254 .  Having  established   the  presence  and  importance  of  emotions  and  affective    552  relations in contemporary protest communi- cation,  the  question,  subsequently,  becomes  whether  moments  of  emotional  connectiv- ity can be understood in terms of ‘collective  identity’.  In  their  introduction  to  a  special  issue on social media and protest identities,  Gerbaudo  and  Treré   2015:  867   strongly  argue  in  favor  of  such  an  assessment. They  maintain  that  the  mass  adoption  of  hashtag  wearethe99percent  in  the  Occupy  protest,  the transformation of the ‘lady in red dress’  picture into a protest symbol during the Gezi  Park protests, and other similar protest shar- ing  practices  are  effectively  ‘manifestations   of collective identity’. Correspondingly, Milan   2015a:  894   argues  that  as  such  practices  take  shape  on  social  media,  they  produce  ‘collective  narratives’  that  score  high  in  terms of ‘bridging’ personal viewpoints and  experiences and ‘building’ and ‘reproducing’  ‘communication-based social capital’. observing   such  instances of collectivity emphasize that these  relations  are  by  no  means  stable. A  collec- tive  ‘we’  can  suddenly  emerge,  but  just  as  quickly disappear. Juris  2012: 266  calls this  the ‘logic of aggregation’, in which a mass of  individuals  quickly  comes  together,  but  can  fall apart at any moment. When today’s pro- testors interact with each other through social  media platforms, they often forge ‘a collec- tive  subjectivity’.  Yet,  as  Juris  points  out,  this  ‘is  a  subjectivity  that  is  under  the  con- stant pressure of disaggregation into its indi- vidual components’  ibid. . Consequently, he  emphasizes the importance of offline interac- tion and community building on the ground  for those interested in building more sustain- able collectives.  However,   scholars   This  brings  us  to  the  second  angle  from  which  we  need  to  complicate  the  idea  that  contemporary  protest  movements  are  pro- pelled  and  shaped  by  self-motivated  social  media sharing practices. We will show that the  techno-commercial architecture of platforms  fundamentally steers how users connect and  interact  with  each  other,  and,  consequently,  how  social  media  protest  organization  and   communication  unfolds. While  many  schol- ars working on contemporary protest move- ments devote some attention to the particular  technological  features  of  platforms,  such  as  hashtags,  like  buttons,  and  algorithms,  this  area  of  research  remains  underexplored.  There  is  little  research  that  systematically  examines  how  social  media  user  practices,  technologies, and business models mutually  articulate each other, or that explores the con- sequences  for  the  character  and  dynamic  of  today’s protest movements.  Techno-commercial sTraTegies  Reflecting on how social media steer popular  contention,  it  is  vital  to  observe  that  these  platforms  are  not  primarily  developed  and  managed  to  facilitate  protest.  Reading  the  celebratory accounts in the press and some of  the  academic  literature  on  the  vital  role  of  social  media  platforms  in  protest  mobiliza- tion and communication, it is easy to forget  that  platforms  are,  above  all,  developed  to  facilitate the systemic collection and analysis  of  user  data  to  enable  various  forms  of  tar- geted  advertising  and  services   Couldry,  2015; Fuchs, 2011; van Dijck, 2013 . There  is  a  constant  tension  between  these  techno- commercial  platform  strategies  and  activist  tactics and values.  To  explore  this  tension,  we  need  to  turn  to what Gillespie calls ‘governance by plat- forms’  see Chapter 14, this volume , which  refers to the ways platforms curate the con- tent  and  police  the  activity  of  their  users.  One  crucial  method  through  which  social  media corporations ‘govern’ is through their  Terms  of  Service   ToS . Youmans  and York   2012   provide  one  of  the  few  studies  that  examines how such a form of governance can  obstruct  activist  communication.  Drawing  from  several  case  studies,  the  authors  dem- onstrate that the policies and user agreements  of  social  media  platforms,  including  those  of  Facebook,  YouTube,  and  Twitter,  have    soCial Media and new Protest MoveMents   553  resulted in the banning of activist users, the  removal of activist content and accounts, and  the  handing  over  of  sensitive  activist  user  information to governments.  One  crucial  example  of  this  are  the  attempts  by  leading  social  media  corpora- tions  to  prohibit  the  use  of  pseudonyms,  also  known  as  real-names  policies,  requir- ing  users  to  identify  themselves  through  their  legal  name.  In  the  case  of  the  above- discussed  ‘Kullena  Khaled  Said’  Facebook  page,  this  policy  caused  substantial  prob- lems. When Wael Ghonim created the page,  he  used  the  pseudonym  ‘ElShaheed’   ‘the  martyr’ . As we have discussed, Ghonim and  his collaborators tried hard to remain anony- mous. They  did  so  both  for  security  and  to  maintain  the  image  of  a  spontaneous  peo- ple’s movement. However, as Facebook does  not allow the use of pseudonyms, Ghonim’s  account  and,  more  importantly,  the  page,  which had become a highly popular opposi- tional  platform,  were  suddenly  deactivated  in November 2010  Youmans & York, 2012:  318–319 . Although the page was relatively  quickly restored, this incident reveals a fun- damental  tension.  For  many  activists  it  is  important  to  remain  anonymous,  whereas  social  media  platform  owners  –  generally  American corporations – have a strong inter- est  in  knowing  users’  real  identities,  which  can be monetized more easily.  Friction  is  also  generated  by  attempts  to  police  the  content  and  activity  on  social  media  platforms  in  accordance  with  par- ticular  ‘community  standards’.  Virtually  all  platforms impose rules to regulate offending  content and behavior, most prominently por- nography, graphic violence, hate speech, and  trolling. Again there is an obvious economic  interest to do so, as such content and behavior  might discourage some groups of users and,  more problematically, deter advertisers, who  do  not  want  their  products  associated  with  potentially offensive content. Platforms rely  on a combination of automated detection of  problematic  content  and  on  users  flagging  and  blocking  such  content   Crawford  &    Gillespie,  2016 .  These  policing  efforts,  while necessary to protect users and the eco- nomic viability of a platform, can undermine  activist  communication. Youmans  and York   2012: 320–321  give the example of various  popular  activist YouTube  videos  from  Syria  and  Egypt,  which  showed  graphic  violence  by  authorities  and  were  removed  from  the  platform for this reason. As in the case of the  Khaled Said page, these videos were eventu- ally  restored  after  complaints  by  journalists  and  activists.  These  examples  illustrate,  on  the one hand, how social media corporations  put up serious efforts to accommodate activ- ist  interests.  On  the  other  hand,  they  also  show that these corporations have a structural  economic  interest  to  systematically  police  the  activity  and  content  on  their  platforms  in ways that do not always correspond with  activists’  politics  of  visibility   ibid.;  Milan,  2015b .  Whereas various studies illustrate the ten- sion  between  activism  and  content  polic- ing  by  platforms,  more  systematic  research  is  needed  to  understand  how  frequent  such  cases are and how they affect protest mobi- lization  and  communication.  Even  more  complex  is  the  question  how  the  particular   technological  architectures  of  platforms  –  their user and programming interfaces, as well   as their algorithmic selection mechanisms –  shape the character and dynamics of protest.  In  other  words,  how  to  ‘weigh’  the  power  of  algorithms  versus  the  power  of  users  to  steer  online  attention  and  relations?  This  is  a  complex  question  as  it  is  impossible  to  precisely determine how algorithms enhance  or  decrease  the  visibility  of  specific  protest  issues and actors, nor is it possible to exactly  pin down how different technologically ena- bled practices, such as hashtagging, retweet- ing, liking, following, and friending, promote  particular types of connection and exchange  between activists. At the same time, as work  in platform and software studies shows, it is  clear  that  the  technological  architectures  of  social  media  do  fundamentally  shape  how  users  connect  and  interact  with  each  other    554   Berry, 2011; Gillespie, 2014; Langlois et al.,  2009 . Consequently, there is a strong need to  critically explore social media protest activ- ity as a particular set of socio-technical prac- tices, even though such an exploration will to  some extend remain speculative.  Acceleration  The first development we would like to high- light  concerns  the  acceleration  of  activist  communication propelled by social media. In  combination with the ubiquitous availability  of advanced mobile communication devices,  social  media  platforms  allow  users  on  the  move  to  exchange  information  in  real  time.  As  various  researchers  have  observed,  the  Web is transforming from a relatively static  environment  primarily  focused  on  informa- tion retrieval to a highly dynamic ecology of  data  streams,  which  constantly  feed  users  with new information  Berry, 2011; Hermida,  2010; Weltevrede et al., 2014 .  This transformation greatly speeds up the  exchange  of  information  between  activists.  On  the  one  hand,  acceleration  can  be  inter- preted  as  a  form  of  empowerment.  Social  media platforms allow activists to document   almost in real time  unfolding protest events,  and massively share their feelings about these  events   Papacharissi  &  de  Fatima  Oliveira,  2012; Poell & Borra, 2012 . Papacharissi and  de Fatima Oliveira use the term ‘instantane- ity’  to  describe  the  instant  online  recording  and  communication  of  unfolding  events,  as  well as the tone and urgency of the language  individuals  employ  on  social  media  plat- forms. Such real-time and ubiquitous forms  of protest communication are of great strate- gic importance to activists. Social media pro- test communication not only shows the larger  world  the  violence  committed  by  authoriti- ties,  but  they  also  allow  protestors  to  coor- dinate  their  activities. As  Earl  et  al.   2013:  472   have  pointed  out  in  their  research  on  the protests against the 2009 G20 summit in  Pittsburgh, such use of social media has the   potential ‘to reduce information asymmetries  between protesters and police’.  On  the  other  hand,  though,  protesters’  social media practices tend to focus attention  on the violence and spectacle that accompa- nies  many  protests.  Historically,  alternative  activist  media  have  been  considered  espe- cially important because these allowed activ- ists to highlight the larger issues at stake in  political  contestation.  In  the  early  2000s,  NGO  sites  and  alternative  online  news  out- lets, such as Indymedia, were celebrated pre- cisely because they facilitated the long-term  articulation and polarization of protest issues.  By discussing such issues and linking alterna- tive sites to each other as well as to corporate  and governmental sites, activists constituted  ‘issue networks’  Bennett, 2004; Dean, 2002;  Marres  and  Rogers,  2005 .  As  Jodi  Dean  wrote in 2002, such networks make it possi- ble to move away from the ‘drive for specta- cle and immediacy that plagues an audience  oriented news cycle’ as they ‘work to main- tain links among those specifically engaged  with  a  matter  of  concern’   2002:  172–173 .  Evidently,  the  event-oriented  focus  and  ‘real-time’  nature  of  social  media  protest  communication  runs  the  risk  of  shifting  the  perspective of online activist communication  from  the  actual  protest  issues  to  the  protest  spectacle.  It is crucial to note that the event-oriented  focus of social media communication is not  merely  the  result  of  specific  user  practices,  but  is  also  prompted  by  the  technological  architectures underpinning social media plat- forms. Various social media sharing mecha- nisms, such as ‘liking’ and ‘retweeting’, are  promoted  by  the  platforms  themselves,  as  well  as  by  many  mainstream  and  alterna- tive news sites in the form of social buttons   Gerlitz  &  Helmond,  2013 .  Omnipresent  sharing  features  encourage  users  to  spread  and repeat breaking news. Further adding to  the newsy character of social media platforms  are  the  ‘hashtag’  and  ‘trending  topic’  fea- tures, which are particularly prominent in the  Twitter architecture, but have more recently    soCial Media and new Protest MoveMents   555  also  been  taken  up  by  Facebook.  Hashtags  instigate users to share and search for news  on  specific  subjects,  whereas  trending  top- ics  further  highlight  breaking  news.  Most  notably,  Twitter  has  developed  their  trend- ing feature into a sophisticated popular news  barometer by identifying the ‘most breaking  news’, and by allowing users to break down  trending topics by region, country, and city.  Given  how  this  event-oriented  focus  is  fundamentally  built  into  social  media  plat- forms’  architectures,  it  will  be  very  diffi- cult  to  reverse  or  adjust  the  perspective  of  social  media  communication. This  becomes  especially  difficult  as  activists  increasingly  build  their  communication  and  organization  strategies  around  social  platforms’  shar- ing  mechanisms  and  orient  these  strategies  towards  the  platforms’  specific  mechanisms  of  algorithmic  selection.  Activists’  practice  of  promoting  particular  hashtags,  such  as  g20report  in  the  case  of  the  G20  protests,  sidibouzid  during  the  Tunisian  revolution,  and 25jan in the early stages of the Egyptian  revolution,  exemplifies  this  tendency.  More  generally, such strategies can be understood  as symptomatic of a more general tendency  among  ‘producers  of  information  to  make  their content, and themselves’, in the words  of Gillespie  2014: 184 , ‘recognizable to an  algorithm’.  Personalization and Virality  The  second  development  we  would  like  to  reflect  on  is  the  ‘personalization’  of  public  communication,  which  many  scholars  have  associated  with  the  rise  of  social  media   Bennett  &  Segerberg,  2011;  Couldry  &  Turow,  2014;  Kennedy  &  Moss,  2015;  Lovink  &  Rasch,  2013;  Pariser,  2011 .  As  discussed, the question of how this develop- ment  affects  protest  has  triggered  a  lot  of  debate,  with  some  researchers  seeing  con- temporary  protest  as  revolving  around  per- sonal action frames, whereas others observe  powerful  moments  of  collectivity  in  social   media  protest  communication.  Yet,  these  observations are primarily based on research  that  focuses  on  social  media  user  practices.  To  advance  this  debate,  it  is  important  to   also examine how personalization is shaped  by  the  techno-commercial  architecture  of  platforms.  From  such  a  perspective,  personalization  involves  social  media  platforms  prompting  users  to  explicitly  make  ‘personal’  connec- tions  and  stimulating  them  to  create  their  persona  by  constantly  posting  and  shar- ing  new  content.  Moreover,  personaliza- tion  uniquely  depends  on  these  platforms’  propensity  to  algorithmically  connect  users  to  content,  advertisers,  and  each  other   van  Dijck  &  Poell,  2013:  9 .  The  development  of the Facebook News Feed, YouTube’s rec- ommended videos, and Twitter’s Top search  results  show  how  social  media  corpora- tions are constantly trying to more precisely  tailor  content  to  users’  specific  interests.  Algorithmic  curation  is,  however,  not  only  about serving each user with a personal diet  of  content,  ads,  and  friend  suggestions,  but  also about connecting users with content that  is  generating  engagement  in  the  larger  net- works  in  which  they  are  situated.  Research  on  the  algorithmic  selection  mechanisms  used  by  the  main  US-based  social  media  platforms  suggests  that  these  mechanisms  take  both  individual  and  collective  user  signals  into  account. As  such,  social  media  platforms  steer  users  towards  personalized  connections,  while  at  the  same  time  intro- ducing  viral  dynamics  in  public  communi- cation that produce moments of collectivity.  Let’s briefly look at each side of the equation  in a bit more detail.  Major  social  media  platforms  such  as  Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube personalize  the  user  experience  on  a  number  of  levels.  First,  they  push  users  to  create  and  extend   their  personal  networks  by  ‘following’  or  ‘friending’  other  users  or  accounts.  They  also  enable  users  to  create  their  own  com- munication  spaces,  for  example,  through  hashtags  such  as  egypt,  sidibouzid,  or     556  in   OccupyWallStreet,  or  the  form  of  Facebook  groups  and  pages,  like  ‘Kullena  Khaled Said’. Finally, social media platforms  algorithmically select for each user the con- tent that is most likely to meet their interests,  hence serving customized media diets. Thus,  the techno-commercial flipside of personali- zation is customized services that steer users  towards particular types of connections, con- tent, and ads.  At  the  same  time,  social  platforms  are  found to promote virality  Goel et al., 2015;  Papacharissi, 2015; Sampson, 2012 . They do  so by providing users with omnipresent like,  share, and retweet buttons to quickly and eas- ily share content with other users. These user  signals  are  subsequently  processed  through  platform  algorithms,  which  tend  to  privi- lege items that rapidly generate a lot of user  engagement,  in  the  form  of  trending  topics  and  most  relevant  content.  While  processes  of algorithmic selection do frequently high- light  protest-related  communication  during  large demonstrations, occupations, and upris- ings  because of their newsworthiness , there  is certainly no guarantee that they will do so.  As  the  Occupy  protestors  found  out,  social  media  algorithms  can  conflict  with  what  users themselves consider relevant. In the fall  of 2011, at the height of the occupations, pro- testors noticed that despite their intense use  of  OccupyWallStreet  and  OccupyBoston,  these  hashtags  trended  almost  anywhere  in  the  US  except  for  New  York  and  Boston,  whereas  less  popular  Occupy-related  terms  and hashtags made it into the trending topic  lists of the two cities. Suspicious Occupiers  subsequently  accused  Twitter  of  manipulat- ing  its  trending  topics.  However,  as  Gilad  Lotan  2011  has demonstrated, no censoring  appears to have taken place; it was the ‘out- come  of  a  purely  algorithmic  mechanism’,  pointing out that the consistent attention given  to  OccupyWallStreet  and  OccupyBoston  in NYC and Boston did not result in attention  spikes. As Lotan explains, trending topics are  not simply determined on the basis of the vol- ume of tweets containing a particular hashtag   or  term.  Instead,  ‘the  algorithm  adapts  over  time,  based  on  the  changing  velocity  of  the  usage of the given term in tweets. If we see a  systematic rise in volume, but no clear spike,  it is possible that the topic will never trend’   ibid.  Similar observations can be made con- cerning  Facebook’s  News  Feed  algorithms   McGee, 2013 .  In other words, social media promote viral  communication  over  sustained  long-term  public attention for specific topics. Not coin- cidentally,  this  predilection  towards  virality  corresponds  with  the  business  strategies  of  the major social platforms, which try to derive  income from  third party  data services that  detect, in real time, emerging topics of popu- lar  interest  as  well  as  shifts  in  public  senti- ment.  Building  on  such  real-time  analytics,  Twitter and especially Facebook are develop- ing personalized systems of targeted advertis- ing, which pick up on the specific interests of  particular  user  aggregates   Cheney-Lippold,  2011; Turrow, 2012; Wilken, 2014 .  In light of these techno-commercial mech- anisms,  which  underpin  the  socio-cultural  forms  of  personalization,  it  should  come  as  no  surprise  that  activist  communication  and  mobilization processes based on social media  have  generated  loosely  connected  protest  networks,  which  just  as  quickly  fall  apart  as  they  are  stitched  together.  Personalization,  real-timeness,  and  virality  are  part  of  social  media’s DNA. The technological architectures  and business models of these media are geared  towards  the  viral  dissemination  of  affective  messages  through  personal  networks.  For  activists this is both a blessing and a curse. As  social  media  penetrate  deeply  into  everyday  personal  communication  in  ways  alternative  media  have  never  been  able  to  do,  activists  can  reach  people  who  would  otherwise  not  be reached by activist communication. At the  same time, the interactions and interests that  tie  dispersed  social  media  users  together  to  form  protest  movements,  generating  instant  moments  of  togetherness,  tend  to  dissolve  when social platforms algorithmically connect  users to the next wave of trending topics.   soCial Media and new Protest MoveMents   557  Alternative media are technologically and  intellectually  designed  to  sustain  interest  in  particular  social  and  political  issues  and  to  build  communities  and  publics  around  such  issues. By contast, on social media there is a  constant  tension  between  community  build- ing and commercial interests and strategies.  Many  of  the  major  social  media  platforms,  on  the  one  hand,  invest  in  the  development  of  community  features,  Facebook  groups  and  pages  are  a  prime  example  of  this.  On  the  other  hand,  to  sustain  their  structural  commercial appetite for online engagement,  these  platforms  also  continuously  introduce  the next set of topics that satisfy user inter- ests, whatever these interests might be. From  this perspective, we suggest that while social  media enable powerful moments of collectiv- ity, communities and publics are destined to  remain  ephemeral  in  social  media  environ- ment, always already on the point of giving  way  to  the  next  set  of  trending  topics  and  related sentiments.  challenges for fuTure   research  The key challenge for future research on the  evolving  relationship  between  social  media  and  the  organization  and  communication  of  protest  is  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  that  is  sensitive  to  the  innovative  ways in which users self-organize, create, and  share  new  protest-related  material,  and  how  collectivity  and  leadership  are  articulated  in  such practices. At the same time, it is crucial  to  critically  interrogate  how  these  practices  are  steered  by  techno-commercial   strategies of corporations. So far, researchers  have tended to either focus on specific sets of  socio-cultural or techno-commercial practices  and  strategies.  This  has  produced  a  lot  of  valuable  insights,  but  has  also  limited  our  ability  to  understand  the  overall  dynamic  of  contemporary  protest.  Without  a  thorough  examination of creative activist social media   the   practices it is hard to understand the vitality  and impact of platform-mediated protest. And  vice versa: without a critical examination of  the techno-commercial strategies of platforms  we cannot fully understand why protest mes- sages  and  activity  can  spread  very  quickly,  but  also  suddenly  disappear  from  the  public  limelight  for examples of research that tries  to  do  both,  see  Galis  &  Neumayer,  2016;  Milan, 2015b; Poell, 2014; Shea et al., 2015 . In a further complication for studying these  interrelated practices, both platform and pro- test  strategies  are  continuously  evolving.  As  has  been  extensively  documented,  social  media corporations constantly tinker with the  algorithms  they  use  to  determine  ‘relevant’  content. Substantial changes in, for example,  Facebook’s News Feed algorithm or Twitter’s  trending topics algorithm are usually publicly  announced,  but  social  platforms  also  make  small changes on a daily basis. Furthermore,  from  time  to  time  these  platforms  introduce  new features, which transform how users can  express  themselves  and  connect  with  each  other.  Prominent  examples  of  this  were  the  launch  of  Facebook’s  News  Feed,  and  the  integration of retweeting and @mentioning in  Twitter’s architecture. And finally, new popular  platforms regularly emerge, such as Snapchat  and WeChat a few years ago, while other plat- forms, like Flickr or Friendster, become less  popular  or  disappear  altogether. All  of  these  changes bring about shifts in how protests are  mobilized and communicated. Exploring such  evolving socio-technical relations, it is impor- tant  to  realize  that  platform  affordances  do  not determine how users employ social tech- nologies,  but  that  they  rather  guide  this  use.  How  particular  social  media  protest  activi- ties  unfold  is  also  very  much  shaped  by  the  creativity and reflexivity of users. Connective  activist  leaders,  as  discussed  in  this  chapter,  have  over  the  years  developed  a  range  of  communication  and  mobilization  strategies  in  using  social  platforms. These  strategies  –  ranging from promoting particular hashtags to  selecting  particular  platforms  to  pursue  core  objectives – are changing over time as well.   558  Thus,  for  researchers,  the  challenge  is  to  trace  how  changing  activist  practices  and  evolving  techno-commercial  platform  strat- egies  mutually  articulate  each  other.  Such  inquiry  should  allow  for  a  more  precise  understanding  of  the  current  dynamic  of   protest organization and communication, but  also how this dynamic has changed over time.  Doing  this  type  of  inquiry  is  by  no  means  easy, as researchers need to take the specific  political-cultural settings of the protests they  are studying into account as well. Evidently, it  matters for activist social media use whether a  protest is directed at an authoritarian state, as  in the case of the Egyptian protests discussed  in this chapter, or at a liberal democratic state.  From the mid-2000s onwards, as the Berkman  Center has documented in detail, states have  made extensive efforts to control online com- munication  Deibert et al., 2010, 2012 . These  efforts  deeply  affect  how  activists  connect  with  each  other  on  social  platforms.  While  the  relations  between  states  and  new  protest  movements are beyond the scope of this chap- ter,  case  studies  on  particular  protests  will  need to take these relations into account.  This brings us back to the call for interdis- ciplinarity with which we started this chapter.  To understand how the character and dynamic  of  social  media  activity  enables  and  shapes  new  protest  movements,  we  need  to  com- bine insights from different fields of research.  While  social  movement  studies  remains  an  important starting point for investigating pro- test,  it  is  also  crucial  to  draw  from  work  in  political  communication,  software  and  plat- form studies, as well as from political econ- omy, surveillance, and censorship research. It  is only through interdisciplinary research that  we can comprehensively explore the complex  political-cultural and socio-technical relations  in which new protest movements take shape.  references  Anduiza, E., Cristancho, C., & Sabucedo, J.

Its Twitter feed is filled with  screenshots of the routes that members of the  platform  have  taken  on  their  bicycle  rides,  swims  or  runs,  and  accounts  of  how  many  kilometres  they  have  travelled  and  how  fast  they  have  done  so.  These  images  and  com- ments contribute to the social media functions  of the site. The Strava website lists the oppor- tunity for members to ‘socialize’ by follow- ing  friends  and  their  activities,  joining  or  creating  clubs  and  ‘pushing’  each  other  by  commenting  on  people’s  data  and  giving  them  kudos  for  their  achievements.  A  new  Strava feature encourages members to upload  photos of their trips to the platform to share  with  other  members.  These  are  entitled  ‘Strava  Stories’,  and  the  most  recent  photos  are displayed at the top of members’ profiles,  framing their other data.  In  my  current  research  on  people  who  use platforms and apps like Strava for track- ing their physical activity, many participants  commented  on  the  pleasures  they  derived  from the social networking functions of such  software. The possibilities of recording infor- mation  about  their  activities,  sharing  these  with members of the site or with friends on  social  media  sites,  comparing  their  data  with  other  athletes,  engaging  in  challenges  and  competitions  and  providing  encourage- ment  to  others  were  viewed  as  motivating,  encouraging  and  adding  a  social  dimension  to their pursuits. These findings are echoed in  researchers’  work  on  self-tracking  physical  fitness pursuits  Rooksby, Rost, Morrison and  Chalmers,  2014;  Epstein,  Jacobson,  Bales,  McDonald  and  Munson,  2015;  Stragier,  Evens and Mechant, 2015 .  As  the  example  of  Strava  demonstrates,  there are growing entanglements between the  practices of self-tracking human bodies and  engaging in social media networks and rela- tionships.  The  expanded  array  of  digitised    lively data, soCial Fitness and biovalue  563  devices  that  are  available  for  self-tracking,  and the capacity of many of these technolo- gies to interact with social media platforms,  has  encouraged  self-trackers  to  share  the  details  that  they  collect  about  themselves  with others. In addition to physical activity,  this personal information may include biom- etrics  such  as  heart  rate,  body  temperature,  body  weight,  sleep  patterns,  mood,  blood  glucose levels, blood pressure, menstrual and  ovulation  cycles,  sexual  activity  and  preg- nancy. As part of their general ethos of pro- moting the sharing of personal information,  mainstream  social  media  platforms  such  as  Instagram,  Twitter,  YouTube  and  Facebook  offer  opportunities  for  people  to  share  the  data  that  they  generate  from  these  self- tracking practices, whether these are photos,  videos, maps of their movements in space or  quantitative data. In turn, some self-tracking  platforms  have  incorporated  tailored  social  media  elements  as  part  of  their  customised  offerings.  The  pleasures  and  affordances  of  the  networking  capabilities  of  these  media  promote a culture of sharing what are often  very  intimate  details  about  people’s  bodies  and  their  movements  in  space.  These  data  have  use  value  that  extends  well  beyond  the  individuals  who  generate  these  details  about  themselves  and  their  social  networks.  As contributors to large datasets of informa- tion about people’s activities and movements  in  space,  these  self-trackers  are  imbricated  within the digital data economy.  In  this  chapter,  I  focus  on  these  intersec- tions,  drawing  out  their  sociocultural  and  political  implications.  The  chapter  begins  with  a  brief  review  of  the  theoretical  per- spectives  that  underpin  my  analysis.  After  describing the range of technologies that are  available  for  physical  activity,  health  and  medical self-tracking, I then discuss the con- cept of ‘social fitness’ and its broader impli- cations. This is followed by an analysis of the  new forms of value that personal health and  medical data have attracted and the political  implications  of  encouraging  people  to  par- ticipate as socially fit citizens.  TheoreTical foundaTions  My approach here is underpinned by a per- spective  that  recognises  the  sociomaterial  status  of  digital  devices,  software  and  the  data  that  they  generate   Rogers,  2013;  Kitchin and Lauriault, 2014 . Digital devices  that generate personal data participate in the  formation  of  digital  data  assemblages,  in  which  technologies  and  humans  work  together  to  create  new  configurations  of  information.  The  digital  data  generated  by  self-tracking  may  be  conceptualised  as  ‘lively’  in  various  ways   Lupton,  2016c .  First, these data are generated from life itself  by documenting humans’ bodies and selves.  Second,  as  participants  in  the  digital  data  economy,  they  are  labile  and  fluid,  open  to  constant  repurposing  by  a  range  of  actors  and  agencies,  often  in  ways  in  which  the  original generators of these data have little or  no  knowledge.  Third,  these  data  are  lively  due  to  the  advent  of  algorithmic  authority  and predictive analytics that use digital self- tracked  data  to  make  inferences  and  deci- sions  about  individuals  and  social  groups.  These data, therefore, have potential effects  on the conduct of life and life opportunities.  Fourth,  by  virtue  of  their  growing  value  as  commodities  or  research  sources,  the  per- sonal data that are derived from self-tracking  practices  have  significant  implications  for  livelihoods   those  using  these  data  in  the  data-mining,  insurance  and  data  science  industries, for instance .  The  recognition  of  the  sociocultural  and  political  implications  of  the  use  of  people’s  personal data by other actors and agencies is  also a key theoretical tenet of my discussion  here. The term ‘prosumption’ is often used to  describe users’ engagement in the digital data  economy as both consumers and producers of  digital data content  Beer and Burrows, 2010;  Ritzer,  2014 .  The  taken-for-granted  defini- tion  of  social  media  relates  to  platforms  or  apps that facilitate and promote prosumption:  the sharing of personal information with other  users  and  opportunities  to  comment  on  or    564  respond to others’ content. However, any form  of personal data that is generated using digital  technologies  now  becomes  ‘social’  by  these  data’s transmission to and storage in databases  on the computing cloud. These data inevitably  enter into the circulations, flows and fluxes of  the digital data economy. As part of big data,  they  contribute  to  social  relations  and  social  selves and the management of social institu- tions and have potential social effects.  Theories  of  surveillance  are  also  highly  pertinent  to  understanding  personal  digital  data assemblages. The role played by digital  technologies in surveillance, or watching, of  people  is  a  central  feature  of  contemporary  data  practices.  As  scholars  in  surveillance  studies  have  emphasised,  there  are  many   different modes of dataveillance, or conduct- ing  modes  of  watching  people  using  data-  generating  technologies   van  Dijck,  2014 .  Some  are  covert  and  non-consensual:  the  subjects  of  these  modes  do  not  realise   that  they  are  being  watched  and  have  not  given  their  permission. These  covert  modes  include the dataveillance conducted by secu- rity  and  policing  agencies,  some  forms  of  commercial collection of personal digital data   and  the  dataveillance  that  is  conducted  by  hackers  or  cybercriminals.  Other  modes  of  dataveillance  are  open  and  voluntary. These  include the self-surveillance that people may  undertake of their own bodies and lives using  mobile and wearable devices, apps and other  software   Lupton,  2016c ;  the  intimate  sur- veillance  that  they  may  conduct  on  friends  and  family  members  as  part  of  their  social  relationships  or  caregiving  practices   Levy,  2015 ;  and  the  social  surveillance  that  is  part of people’s interactions of social media  platforms,  in  which  they  watch  each  other   Marwick, 2012 .  Early  versions  of  social  media  platforms  focused on the ideals of sharing and participa- tory democracy; the free exchange of informa- tion for the mutual benefit of all users  Beer  and Burrows, 2010; John, 2013 . Several crit- ical scholars have drawn attention to the ways  in  which  this  participatory  and  communal   ethos is now harnessed to commercial, mana- gerial and surveillance imperatives that seek  to  exploit  people’s  prosumption  activities     van  Dijck,  2013;  Fuchs,  2014;  van  Dijck,  2014; Zuboff, 2015; Banning, 2016 . Zuboff   2015  uses the term ‘surveillance capitalism’  to refer to what she characterises as a new era  in capitalist economic systems, in which per- sonal digital data as part of big data have taken  on immense value as commodities. As I will  go on to outline in this chapter, the value of  personal biometric data has significant impli- cations  for  how  self-trackers  use  and  share  their data with others on social media and also  for how they may lose control of their data as  they enter the digital data economy.  self-Tracking and The  quanTified self  Self-tracking  is  an  enterprise  that  involves  individuals  observing  and,  in  many  cases,  recording  details  of  their  bodies  and  lives,  often  for  achieving  self-knowledge,  self- reflection  and  self-improvement.  Monitoring  and measuring details of their bodies’ physical  activities and functions is a common focus for  many self-trackers. In recent years, the prac- tices of self-tracking using digital devices have  received  growing  attention  from  the  popular  media  and  in  academic  research. While  self- tracking  has  taken  place  for  millennia,  new  digital technologies facilitate the collection of  ever-more detailed personal information. Self- trackers are drawing on the capacities of new  technologies to generate increasing quantities  and  diverse  forms  of  information  about  their  bodies  and  selves   Rooksby  et  al.,  2014;  Ruckenstein,  2014,  2015:  6;  Barta  and  Neff,  2015;  Epstein  et  al.,  2015;  Lomborg  and  Frandsen, 2015; Stragier et al., 2015 .  Terms other than self-tracking are used to  refer to self-monitoring practices: lifelogging,  personal  analytics,  personal  informatics  and  the quantified self. The ‘quantified self’ is a  relatively new term, but has become popularly    lively data, soCial Fitness and biovalue  565  used. Wired journalists Gary Wolf and Kevin  Kelly invented it in 2007 to describe the prac- tices  that  they  had  observed  among  friends  and  colleagues  involving  the  use  of  digital  technologies  to  monitor  and  measure  them- selves. Wolf  and  Kelly  went  on  to  establish  the  Quantified  Self  website   Quantified  Self,  2016   and  to  establish  the  associated  Quantified Self Labs to facilitate the develop- ment of technologies directed at self-trackers.  Since  then,  the  ‘quantified  self’  or  ‘quanti- fying  the  self’  terms  have  been  taken  up  in  the popular media and some of the academic  literature to refer to various methods of self- tracking  and  especially  those  that  involve  using  digital  devices  to  generate  numerical  data   Lupton,  2013c .  I  prefer  to  use  ‘self- tracking’ in my work, as it is a broader term  that  encompasses  all  the  different  types  and  practices  of  self-monitoring,  including  col- lecting both metrics and qualitative data.  All forms of self-tracking involve data prac- tices,  or  ways  of  generating,  engaging  with,  interpreting  and  applying  the  insights  devel- oped from personal data, and data materiali- sations, or ways of representing data  Lupton,  2016c . When self-trackers use methods such  as journal keeping or writing down numbers,  it is difficult to analyse these data for their pat- terns. Digital data devices and apps and other  software  provide  the  opportunity  to  access  and  analyse  personal  details  efficiently  and  quickly.  These  technologies  also  let  users  combine  different  data  sets  to  identify  pat- terns in ways that were not achievable in the  past. Indeed, the difficulty now faced by self- trackers is the overwhelming mass of data that  they may have to deal with, given the infinite  number  of  ways  in  which  data  sets  can  be  combined with the aim of generating insights.  Technologies for self-Tracking  fiTness, healTh and medicine  New  digital  technologies  are  increasingly  incorporated  into  healthcare  delivery  and   health  promotion  initiatives.  Telemedicine  and  telehealth  initiatives  offered  to  patients  have  emphasised  self-monitoring  as  part  of  patient self-care for chronic conditions such  as diabetes and high blood pressure for over  two decades. Well before the advent of digi- tal technologies, patients were encouraged to  keep  track  of  their  blood  glucose  level  or  blood  pressure  using  technologies  that  they  could operate themselves, and to take note of  the readings as part of managing their condi- tion  and  treatment  regimen.  The  latest  ver- sions  of  telemedicine  offer  continuous  real-time  self-monitoring,  wireless  data  transfer and cloud computing storage facili- ties  that  reduce  the  expense  and  expertise  required  for  the  proprietary  systems  that  were  characteristic  of  earlier  technologies.  Self-care strategies using digital devices have  become incorporated in the ideal of the digi- tally engaged patient, who is willing and able  to take up these devices for self-monitoring   Lupton,  2013a .  Patient  self-monitoring  technologies  that  are  now  available  include  digital  pills  embedded  with  sensors  that  monitor  the  body  from  within  by  sending  signals  to  a  patch  worn  on  the  user’s  arm.  Continuous  wearable  monitoring  devices  measure  such  bodily  features  as  physical  movement,  blood  glucose  levels,  body  tem- perature, sleep patterns, heart rate and func- tion,  lung  function,  blood  pressure  and  oxygen saturation and brain activity. Sensor  pads are available to place under mattresses  or  in  chairs to  monitor  heart  rate,  breathing  and body movement and mobility. These data  can then be transmitted wirelessly to health- care providers or caregivers as part of remote  monitoring programs  for overviews of these  technologies,  see  Swan,  2012a,  2012b;  Lupton, 2013a, 2014b; Topol, 2015 . activity   self-  monitoring  also  takes  place  among  healthy  populations  using  new  apps  and  wearable  technologies. Thousands of apps for the self- tracking  of  human  bodies  are  available  for  downloading.  By  late  2015,  160,000  health  and  medical  apps  had  been  placed  on  the   and  physical   Health    566  market,  most  of  which   65  per  cent   focus  on  promoting  wellness,  diet  and  exercise,  with  nearly  a  quarter  directed  at  the  self- management of chronic diseases such as dia- betes, high blood pressure and mental health  conditions.  One  in  ten  have  the  capability  to connect to a monitoring device or sensor,  while  a  third  can  connect  to  social  media  networks. There are a small number of very  popular,  highly-downloaded  apps,  such  as  some of the fitness tracking or calorie count- ing apps, period trackers or medical informa- tion apps such as WebMD  IMS Institute for  Healthcare Informatics, 2015 .  Digital devices that are available for self- tracking include wireless body weight scales  and  blood  pressure  monitors  and  wearable  trackers. The range of wearables offered by  the  Fitbit,  Misfit,  Nike  and  Jawbone  com- panies  include  wristbands,  headbands,  pen- dants  or  devices  clipped  to  clothing.  Many  of  these  wearables  either  interact  with  cus- tomised  apps  or  sync  with  platforms  such  as  Runkeeper,  Strava  and  MapMyFitness.  Smartwatches  also  now  offer  biometric  tracking. For example, the new Apple Watch  includes  a  range  of  sensors,  such  as  geolo- cation,  accelerometer,  gyroscope  and  heart  rate  monitors  that  facilitate  self-tracking.  It  offers  two  pre-loaded  apps,  Workout  and  Fitness,  which  record  the  wearer’s  levels  of  physical  activity.  There  is  also  a  range  of  smart clothing and sporting equipment on the  market,  including  shirts,  helmets,  bats  and  balls  equipped  with  sensor-based  technolo- gies  for  monitoring  and  measuring  exercise  and sporting activities. Several self-tracking  device developers are finding ways of incor- porating  their  technologies  into  the  Internet  of Things  so  that  these  devices  can  interact  with  other  monitoring  digital  technologies.  For  example,  the  Misfit  company  is  work- ing on integrating its wristband self-tracking   device  that  currently  facilitates  sleep  and  physical fitness monitoring with Nest, ‘smart  home’  monitoring  software  that  regulates  the  home  thermostat.  The  users’  sleep  data  can  then  be  incorporated  into  the  home   thermostat system to regulate air temperature  based on the occupant’s sleeping patterns and  time of awakening in the morning.  Self-tracking initiatives focusing on health  and  fitness  are  spreading  from  the  clinic  into  insurance  and  the  workplace.  Some  health  insurance  companies  are  taking  up  self-tracking initiatives as part of user-based  insurance  policy  calculations,  encouraging  their  clients  to  upload  their  health  and  fit- ness  data  to  receive  incentives  or  reduced  premiums.  In  the  USA,  these  programs  are  often linked to the provision of health insur- ance by the employers, who therefore have a  financial incentive to motivate their employ- ees  to  take  part. The  manufacturers  of  self- tracking  devices  are  approaching  American  workplaces to use their technologies in their  corporate ‘wellness programs’  Olson, 2014;  Zamosky, 2014 . Children and young people  are also encouraged to engage in health and  fitness  self-monitoring  endeavours.  Several  wearable  device  manufacturers  offer  child- sized  devices  that  parents  can  purchase  as  part  of  nudging  their  children  to  be  more  physically active. Some schools are introduc- ing  self-tracking  as  part  of  physical  educa- tion and health classes. Initiatives such as the  UNICEF Kid Power program involve recruit- ing  children  and  young  people  to  monitor  their  physical  activity  using  a  digital  wrist- band  and  use  the  points  they  earn  to  play  games  that  unlock  therapeutic  food  packets  for malnourished children.  personal healTh daTa   and social media  The  use  of  social  media  for  medical  and  health-related  purposes  has  become  wide- spread. Patient online discussion groups and  blogs  written  by  healthcare  providers  or  institutions and patients are long-established  modes  of  digital  health  communication  and  interaction.  The  role  played  by  websites  in  providing health and medical information to    lively data, soCial Fitness and biovalue  567  lay people  ‘Dr Google’  has been well rec- ognised  for  some  years   Fox  and  Duggan,  2013;  Kivits,  2013 .  Online  searching  remains  a  dominant  source  of  information  about medical conditions, with the top web- sites, such as WebMD, receiving tens of mil- lions of users each month  eBizMBA, 2016 .  The newer social media platforms are often  represented in the medical and public health  literature  as  an  extension  of  Dr  Google:  a  means by which lay people can continue to  seek  information  about  health,  illness  and  medicine  online  and,  importantly,  easily  share  their  experiences  with  others.  Sometimes these initiatives are promoted by  patients and related lay person organisations   Lupton, 2014a . As part of championing the  ideal of digital patient engagement  Lupton,  2013a , healthcare and public health profes- sionals  have  also  frequently  called  for  lay  people to collect information on themselves  and  share  these  on  social  media   Swan,  2012a;  Lefebvre  and  Bornkessel,  2013;  Househ, Borycki and Kushniruk, 2014 .  Twitter has been used to facilitate informa- tion sharing among people interested in spe- cific health and medical topics or conditions,  including lay people as well as healthcare pro- fessionals  and  officials  and  pharmaceutical  and  medical  device  companies.  Condition- specific  Facebook  pages  promote  the  inter- action  of  patients  with  each  other.  Patients  can  upload  videos  to  YouTube  about  their  illness experiences. Many examples of surgi- cal techniques are available on that platform,  including demonstrations by medical profes- sionals, tand also videos made by lay people  seeking  to  display  ‘do-it-yourself’  surgery.  Several  patient-oriented  platforms,  such  as  PatientsLikeMe,  Treato  and  CureTogether,  offer  opportunities  for  patients  join   condition-specific communities and to record  their  symptoms  and  treatments.  These  data  are  then  aggregated  to  provide  information  for users about trends among other members  of the site. Some initiatives have been devel- oped to encourage people to use sensor tech- nologies  to  track  their  local  environment  as   to   part of citizen science projects. There are also  opportunities for people to use social media  to rank and rate their medical care providers.  The Patient Opinion platforms in the UK and  Australia, for example, encourage patients to  provide feedback on the care that they receive  in  their  national  healthcare  systems.  In  the  USA,  platforms  like  ZocDoc   with  associ- ated  apps  for  mobile  devices   help  patients  find  doctors  and  dentists  in  their  local  area  and  make  appointments  online,  as  well  as  read reviews of doctors by other users.  People who track their biometric data for  health-promoting  purposes  often  use  social  media.  Facebook  is  one  major  social  media  platform  in  which  self-trackers  share  their  latest  information  with  others.  They  can  post  regular  updates  on  exercise  routines  and  achievements  with  Facebook  friends  or  contribute to specialised pages that have been  set up to establish communities around spe- cific  exercise  or  sporting  interests.  Twitter,  Instagram  and  Tumblr  offer  further  oppor- tunities for people to share their information  and  images  with  other.  They  can  employ  a  relevant  hashtag  to  draw  attention  to  their  data and contribute to a community of peo- ple  with  shared  interests.  More  specialised  platforms, such as Fitocracy, Daily Mile and  Strava, encourage users to share their fitness  achievements  with  other  members,  empha- sising  the  competitive  dimension  of  com- paring  numbers.  The  weight-loss  platform  Extra  Pounds  combines  ‘body  logs’  with  access  to  support  groups,  while  PumpUp  focuses  on  users  uploading  selfies  to  docu- ment  their  fitness  achievements  and  shar- ing healthy recipes with each other. Several  health and fitness self-tracking app develop- ers have worked on making the social media  elements  of  their  apps  more  prominent  and  easy to use. A survey of health and medical  apps  published  in  2015  found  that  recent  apps  were  more  likely,  when  compared   with apps available two years ago, to offer the  functions of connecting to another device or  wearable or social media  Comstock, 2015 .  The MapMyFitness app, for example, is now    568  integrated  with  Facebook,  and  users  can  create or join groups of other users to share  routes and training plans, organise events and  compare progress.  Patient  self-care,  voluntary  self-tracking  and  social  media  use  are  coming  together  in  some  initiatives.  In  medicine  and  health  informatics   a  field  devoted  to  understand- ing the best ways of generating, storing and  using  health  and  medical  information   the  term ‘patient generated data’ has begun to be  employed  Huba and Zhang, 2012 . This term  describes the various ways in which patients  or  their  lay  caregivers  produce  information  about  the  patients  outside  the  clinic  setting,  through  self-tracking  efforts,  using  remote  monitoring  self-care  devices  or  uploading  material to social media platforms or as part  of routine transactions online. For their part,  healthcare providers and public health work- ers  use  social  media  as  part  of  their  work- ing  lives.  Healthcare  professionals  employ  LinkedIn, Twitter and closed Facebook pages  to join specialised groups, discuss cases with  each  other  and  provide  advice.  Hundreds  of  YouTube  channels,  Facebook  pages  and  Twitter accounts have been set up by hospi- tals  and  healthcare  organisations  as  part  of  public relations strategies.  The phrase ‘social fitness’ is used to refer  to these practices of sharing personal data to  facilitate  motivation  and  achieving  personal  goals. This is particularly clearly outlined on  the  Strava  website. As  is  contended  on  the  website, ‘Strava lets you experience what we  call social fitness – connecting and compet- ing  with  each  other  via  mobile  and  online  apps’ and thereby providing ‘motivation and  camaraderie’.  The  overt  and  broader  mean- ing of social fitness has its roots in physical  exercise training or weight loss regimes and  encouraging people to join groups as a means  of mobilising the support of others to achieve  their goals. The importance of social networks  as part of motivation in health promotion has  frequently  been  employed  in  psychological  models of behaviour change  see, for exam- ple,  Bandura,  2004 .  In  recent  times,  the   field of persuasive computing has employed  these types of models in designing interven- tions for behavioural change relate to health   Purpura,  Schwanda,  Williams,  Stubler  and  Sengers,  2011 .  When  it  is  employed  more  specifically to online health and fitness self- tracking, the newest version of social fitness  refers to sharing personal data and engaging  in  online  communities  for  the  same  ends.  Social fitness has become integral to corpo- rate  ‘wellness  programs’.  Some  workplaces  have  instituted  competitions  requiring  par- ticipating employees to upload and display to  all other workmates data they have collected  on  their  bodily  movements  and  weight  loss  using self-tracking devices as part of efforts  to  motivate  them  to  achieve  higher  fitness  levels   Zamosky,  2014 . The  Jawbone  com- pany  Jawbone, 2016  offers the ‘Up Group’  package  to  employers  seeking  to  institute  wellness programs. On its website, Jawbone  argues  that  promoting  competition  between  different teams in an organisation will moti- vate individuals to exercise more, sleep bet- ter  and  eat  healthier  food.  Team  members  are  encouraged  to  view  the  data  on  their  apps showing how their team is performing  against other teams and to upload supportive  comments  and  emoticons  to  motivate  other  team members.  The  Quantified  Self  website   Quantified  Self, 2016  provides an online social medium  by  which  people  interested  in  self-tracking  can  share  experiences.  A  Facebook  page  and  Twitter  account  also  link  to  the  web- site. The co-founders of the Quantified Self  movement  have  asserted  from  its  incep- tion  that  one  of  its  integral  elements  is  to  develop community among its members and  encourage them to share with other members  details of their self-tracked data and the les- sons that they have learnt from self-tracking.  In his first article on the Quantified Self for  Wired  magazine,  Gary  Wolf   2009   stated  that self-tracking involves the sharing of data  and  collaboration  on  ways  of  using  them.   An  important  dimension  of  the  Quantified  Self movement, meetups and conferences is    lively data, soCial Fitness and biovalue  569  the ‘show-and-tell’ mode of communication.  Many  ‘show-and-tell’  videos  appear  on  the  Quantified Self website. They typically fea- ture an individual standing in front of a group  talking about their self-tracking experiences.  The Quantified Self also includes numerous  examples of data visualisations that members  have generated, allowing them to share these  visualisations with other members. In several  blog  posts  on  the  Quantified  Self  website,  Gary  Wolf   for  example,  Wolf,  2014   has  argued for the importance of ‘our data’, or the  pool of aggregated data collected from self- trackers. Other commentators who champion  the notion of ‘the quantified us’ privilege the  ways in which aggregated personal data sets  can contribute to self-tracking communities.  Writing in Wired magazine, Jordan and Pfarr   2014  claim that: ‘Ultimately the Quantified  Us can help people take better care of them- selves, more often – and feel more connected  to each other in the process.’  I  have  developed  a  typology  of  the  five  distinctive  modes  of  self-tracking  that  have  emerged  in  recent  times.  This  identifies  the  different  uses  of  self-tracking  data  and  the  diverse  range  of  actors  and  agencies  involved  Lupton, 2016b, 2016c . When self-  monitoring  is  self-initiated  and  purely  vol- untary,  responding  to  self-directed  objec- tives and goals, it conforms to the mode that  I entitle ‘private self-tracking’. This mode is  perhaps the most public and well-known face  of self-tracking, particularly in portrayals of  the  Quantified  Self  phenomenon.  ‘Pushed  self-tracking’  departs  from  the  private  self- tracking  mode  in  that  the  initial  incentive  for  engaging  in  self-tracking  comes  from  another  actor  or  agency.  People  may  take  up  self-tracking  voluntarily,  but  initially  in  response to external encouragement or advo- cating.  ‘Imposed  self-tracking’  involves  the  imposition  of  self-tracking  practices  upon  individuals by other actors and agencies pri- marily for these others’ benefit. ‘Communal  self-tracking’ describes the voluntary sharing  of a tracker’s personal data with other people  as a central feature of self-tracking practice.   ‘Exploited  self-tracking’  refers  to  the  ways  in which other actors and agencies repurpose  people’s  personal  data  from  self-tracking  practices.  As  this  section  has  outlined,  the  private,  pushed,  imposed  and  communal  modes are apparent in self-tracking practices  for fitness, health and medical purposes. The  data  generated  from  all  of  these  modes  can  be exploited by other actors and agencies, as  I detail in the next section.  The exploiTaTion of   personal healTh daTa  Many  commercial,  research  and  managerial  uses  of  the  types  of  personal  health  and  medical  data  that  are  uploaded  to  social  media  sites  have  been  identified.  Health  insurance  companies,  government  bodies,  pharmaceutical  and  medical  technology  companies,  healthcare  organisations,  self- tracking  device  developers  and  entrepre- neurs, researchers and employers are finding  ways  of  exploiting  people’s  personal  data  from self-tracking.  Healthcare,  pharmaceutical  and  biotech- nology companies frequently use social and  other digital media for marketing and public  relations purposes, or ‘building their brands’   Belby,  2015 . This  takes  place  in  a  variety  of ways, from the traditional explicit type of  marketing,  such  as  sponsoring  banner  ads  and conferences, to the covert, like attempt- ing to influence social media discussions on  platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. Some  pharmaceutical companies employ research- ers  to  harvest  data  from  blogs  written  by  people about an illness or medical condition  they  have  or  Twitter  exchanges  by  patients  about  their  conditions  and  therapies.  Using  this material, the companies’ employees then  attempt  to  influence  conversation  threads   Robinson,  2014 .  Healthcare  professionals  and  organisations  employ  patient-generated  data  for  purposes  such  as  health  profiling  for targeting treatment and illness prevention    570  strategies.  In  the  USA,  the Affordable  Care  Act  promotes  payment  systems  that  reward  keeping  patients  out  of  the  hospital  system.  Hospitals  have  begun  to  invest  in  big  data  technologies  to  construct  new  risk  models  of  patients.  Information  about  patients  is  entered into hospital data systems, including  biometric  and  treatment  details  from  their  medical  records  and  patient  self-monitoring  activities  at  home  and  demographic  charac- teristics  such  as  race  or  ethnicity,  age  and  gender. These data are used to predict which  patients  are  more  likely  to  require  readmis- sion for medical care  Humphries, 2013 .  Health promoters have experimented with  using social media sites to disseminate infor- mation  about  preventive  health,  collect  data  about people’s health-related behaviours and  attempt to ‘nudge’ members of target groups  to change their behaviour. Public health pro- fessionals employ various social media tools  to  disseminate  information  about  health  risks  and  disease  outbreaks  and  to  collect  data on the incidence of illness and disease.  One  example  is  the  digital  tool  HealthMap.  The software can search the web for disease  reports  from  online  news  reports,  blogs,  social  media  platforms  and  official  reports  and can represent disease outbreaks visually  on a digital map. It includes an app that users  can download to their mobile digital devices  so that they can identify what region is expe- riencing an outbreak of infectious disease or  report cases that are then followed up.  Crowdsourcing health and medical data is  often championed in discussions of how such  big  data  can  benefit  not  only  the  patients  themselves  who  contribute  their  informa- tion to such sites, but also other patients with  the  same  condition,  healthcare  providers,  caregivers  and  commercial  bodies  such  as  pharmaceutical  and  medical  device  compa- nies.  Patient  support  and  opinion  platforms  have  become  increasingly  commercialised.  The  data  generated  by  people  contributing  their experiences of illness and treatments on  many  of  these  platforms  are  now  routinely  harvested  by  the  developers  and  on-sold  to   third  parties   Lupton,  2014a .  For  example,  the  Treato  website  landing  page  boasts  that  membership  of  the  site  is  over  two  million  patients   Treato,  2016 . The  site  focuses  on  harvesting  patients’  accounts  of  drug  thera- pies across the spectrum of social media and  other  digital  platforms,  including  seeking  out  accounts  of  how  well  drugs  work,  their  side-effects  and  why  patients  may  switch  one  brand  for  another.  Treato  provides  free  access to the general data that are collected,  but  also  offers  a  more  targeted  service  to  pharmaceutical  companies  that  incurs  fees.  The PatientsLikeMe site also offers members  the opportunity to enrol directly into clinical  trials of new pharmaceuticals.  Data  privacy  and  security  problems  have  emerged  in  relation  to  the  generation  and  sharing  of  personal  biometric  details.  People’s very intimate bodily details that they  upload  to  apps  and  social  media  sites  may  be  disclosed  to  others  without  their  knowl- edge  or  consent.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  many  developers  of  health  and  fitness  tracking apps fail to secure the personal data  uploaded to the apps and that these apps often  leak personal data in covert ways  Adhikari,  Richards and Scott, 2014; Huckvale, Prieto,  Tilney,  Benghozi  and  Car,  2015 . There  are  also  many  privacy  threats  involved  with  uploading personal health and medical infor- mation  to  social  media  platforms,  includ- ing  the  misuse  of  the  data,  accidental  data  releases, disclosures to third parties and user  profiling across sites  Li, 2015 . Data-mining  and data brokering companies and advertis- ers have a vested interest in health and medi- cal data. Some of these agencies use the data  to  construct  detailed  profiles  or  predictive  analytics that may be used to make decisions  about  people’s  eligibility  for  employment,  insurance and credit. Profiles of people with  conditions  such  as  sexually  transmissible  diseases,  HIV AIDS,  cancer  and  mental  ill- nesses  and  who  have  been  victims  of  sex- ual  assault  are  regularly  developed  by  data  miners  and  brokers  for  sale  to  advertising  agencies,  potential  employers  and  financial    lively data, soCial Fitness and biovalue  571  institutions  Pasquale, 2014 . If used in these  ways, the kinds of personal data that are gen- erated by self-tracking and shared on social  media may, therefore, have significant impli- cations  for  people’s  life  chances   Crawford  and  Schultz,  2014;  Rosenblat,  Wikelius,  boyd, Gangadharan and Yu, 2014 .  The  exploitation  of  personal  health  and  medical  data  is  taking  place  in  legal  ways,  but  also  on  the  part  of  hackers  and  cyber- criminals, who seek to access illegally these  data  for  financial  gain.  Criminal  breaches  of  medical  digital  data  sets  are  becoming  common.  Such  data  can  be  used  in  identity  theft, fraudulent health insurance claims and  to gain access to pharmaceuticals and medi- cal equipment  McCarthy, 2013; Humer and  Finkle,  2014 .  In  early  2015,  for  example,  confidential  information  about  80  million  patients  was  accessed  illegally  on  the  data- base  of  the  American  healthcare  provider  Anthem Inc., which had failed to encrypt this  information  Symons, 2015 .  discussion: digiTised bodies,  surveillance and biocapiTal  Self-tracking for health and medical purposes  is just one way, among a plethora of others,  to render fleshly bodies into digital data. The  digitised  data  assemblages  that  are  config- ured  via  self-tracking  technologies  are  the  newest forms of ‘informatic bodies’  Waldby,  2000 .  Accounts  of  self-tracking  for  health  and  medical  purposes  are  beginning  to  describe a data entity generated from an indi- vidual’s  different  personal  data  sets.  Thus,  writing  recently  for  Nature,  Kish  and Topol   2015  describe the ‘external wisdom of the  body’  that  these  data  sets  comprise,  while  Swan  2013  makes reference to the ‘extended  exoself’  configured  by  self-tracking  data.  These metaphors draw on age-old representa- tions of human bodies as machines and, more  lately,  as  computerised  information  systems   Lupton, 2012b, 2013c . In responding to the   new  affordances  of  the  digitised  human  as  part  of  the  Internet  of  Things,  these  meta- phors represent the human body as an entity  that  constantly  generates  digital  data  and  pushes  these  data  out  into  the  increasingly  interconnected  digital  world  of  smart  things  and  simultaneously  incorporates  these  data  back as the individual responds to their data  and makes changes to their lives.  The data that self-tracking practices gener- ate have different forms of value for different  actors and agencies. For the individual self- tracker, these data are opportunities to acquire  self-knowledge, engage in self-reflection and  optimise their lives. Self-trackers often seek  to make meaning from their data. The prac- tice  is  not  simply  about  collecting  data,  as  this suggests, but also attempting to engage  with such issues as what should be done with  these  data,  how  they  should  be  presented  and  interpreted,  and  what  the  implications  are for self-trackers’ identity and future life  prospects  and  success   Nafus  and  Sherman,  2014; Ruckenstein, 2014; Lupton, 2016c . In  so doing, self-trackers are engaging in volun- tary self-surveillance. The process of mean- ing making may be facilitated by engaging in  data sharing practices. For those who partici- pate in the communal mode of self-tracking,  these  data  offer  a  means  of  entering  into  exchanges  of  personal  information  for  the  mutual benefit of other users or the opportu- nity to contribute to aggregated big data sets  that promise to reveal insights that may be of  use to themselves and others  Barta and Neff,  2015;  Lupton,  2016c .  When  self-trackers  engage  in  these  practices,  they  are  inviting  the surveillance of others and are thus engag- ing in social surveillance.  When  self-tracking  practices  enter  into  social media platforms they draw on deeply  felt desires for becoming part of communities,  connecting and sharing with others, exchang- ing common experiences and opening private  details about oneself to others in the interests  of  altruism,  creating  social  bonds  and  soli- darity, contributing to stocks of new knowl- edge as well as learning more about oneself    572   Barta  and  Neff,  2015;  Banning,  2016 . As  I  argued  in  my  introductory  remarks,  self- trackers  can  gain  much  pleasure  from  their  participation in social surveillance, enjoying  feeling  part  of  a  community  of  like-minded  people  and  the  often  playful  dimensions  of  demonstrating  their  achievements  to  others,  motivating  and  supporting  others  or  engag- ing  in  competitive  endeavours  with  other   members   Whitson,  2013;  Lomborg  and  Frandsen, 2016 .  The skilful manipulation and portrayal of  personal data is a key factor of this type of  social surveillance. The ‘show and tell’ pres- entations  on  the  Quantified  Self  and  other  self-tracking forums are often very complex  and  aesthetically  appealing,  conforming  to  the  appeal  of  the  ‘data  spectacle’   Gregg,  2015 .  The  pleasures  of  ‘showing  and  tell- ing’  in  these  formats,  therefore,  include  engaging in the opportunity to let other inter- ested  people  know  about  the  insights  about  oneself that the tracker has garnered, as well  as displaying prowess in making these data  beautiful  or  easy  to  understand.  Such  com- munications of personal data seek to attract  the  interest  and  attention  of  other  people  and in the communal and sharing ethos that  is  an  integral  dimension  of  the  Quantified  Self movement. They have strong performa- tive dimensions in revealing both how a pre- senter’s  self-tracking  efforts  have  improved  their  lives  and  also  how  adept  they  are  at  manipulating self-tracking technologies and  data materialisations and thereby facilitating  the sharing of their data with others  Nafus  and  Sherman,  2014;  Barta  and  Neff,  2015;  Lupton, 2016c .  Indeed, it could be argued that yet another  type of surveillance is demonstrated in self- trackers’ engagements on social media: that  of ludic surveillance, involving these pleasur- able elements of competition and play. As part  of the general ‘ludification’ of many aspects  of social life and selfhood  Frissen, Lammes,  de Lange, de Mul and Raessens, 2015 , self- tracking  of  human  bodies  has  become  pro- gressively oriented towards these elements as   a way of engaging users and maintaining their  participation. This is even evident in apps that  allow  people  to  monitor,  measure  and  then  share details of their pregnancies  Lupton and  Thomas, 2015; Thomas and Lupton, 2015  or  sexual activities  Lupton, 2015 .  in   As  outlined   the  Introduction,   the  uploading  and  sharing  of  personal  informa- tion  that  occurs  on  online  platforms,  how- ever,  is  no  longer  confined  to  a  community  of  like-minded  individuals  seeking  to  help  each other. As knowledge in the form of digi- tal data has become increasingly valuable for  commercial,  research  and  managerial  pur- poses, the participatory, sharing and playful  ethos of social media has become commodi- fied and exploited by a multitude of actors and  agencies. The progressive commercialisation  of  the  sharing  economy  has  implications  for  digitised  self-tracking  practices.  Actors  and  agencies  other  than  those  collecting   their  personal  information  have  compelling  reasons  for  wanting  to  access  and  harvest  these  data.  The  data  generated  by  practices  of voluntary self-surveillance, social surveil- lance  and  ludic  surveillance  are  now  often  available to the surveillance and exploitation  of these actors and agencies. Unlike previous  forms of self-tracking, in which personal data  could  be  kept  private,  digitised  data  assem- blages  cannot  easily  be  protected  from  the  gaze or use by others.  As the digital data economy has expanded,  and  entrepreneurs,  researchers,  managers,  businesses  and  cybercriminals  have  recog- nised the possibilities of digital data, personal  information  such  as  that  uploaded  to  health  and medical social media sites has taken on  a  new  form  of  commercial  value  –  that  of  ‘biovalue’  Lupton, 2014c, 2016c . Biovalue  is  produced  from  the  surplus  commercial  value  that  is  attributed  to  biological  objects  such as human body tissues, cells and organs   Waldby, 2000; Mitchell and Waldby, 2006;  Rose, 2007a . Just as this human fleshly mat- ter is now a commodity traded for financial  profit,  the  data  about  human  bodies,  their  functions  and  behaviours  that  are  generated    lively data, soCial Fitness and biovalue  573  by  self-tracking  devices  have  become  valu- able  entities.  The  fact  that  these  data  are  about ‘life itself’ has become exploitable in  new ways. The biovalue that is generated by  personal  digital  data  is  yet  another  form  of  surveillance capitalism.  The   incorporation  of  biometric  self- tracked  data  into  the  digital  data  economy  and the subsequent exploitation of these data  is an instance of biopolitics and biopower. As  originally outlined by Foucault  for example,  1988, 1991, 2008 , biopolitics and biopower  are  exercised  in  and  through  human  bod- ies. They  are  modes  of  power  relations  that  rely  on  concepts  of  human  subjectivity  and  embodiment in which practices of self-care,  self-knowledge  and  self-optimisation  are  privileged   Lupton,  1995;  Rose  and  Novas,  2005;  Rose,  2008 .  The  social  media  plat- forms  that  have  been  developed  to  promote  the  uploading  of  these  data,  the  sharing   of these data and their subsequent entry into  the digital data knowledge economy provide  routes  for  the  translation  of  biodata  into  a  new  form  of  biovalue  that  generates  digital  biocapital.  When thinking about the entanglements of  biometrics, biovalue and biopolitics, the con- cept  of  social  fitness  takes  on  an  expanded  form of meaning. Programs directed at pre- ventive medicine, patient self-care and health  promotion have traditionally relied on a dis- course of ideal citizenship that melds private  objectives with the public good, the self with  the  community.  Notions  of  idealised  ‘bio- citizenship’   Rose  and  Novas,  2005   in  the  contemporary  neoliberal  state  emphasise  self-responsibility  and  the  entrepreneurial  management  and  optimisation  of  one’s  life,  including  promoting  and  maintaining  good  health  and  physical  fitness   Lupton,  1995;  Petersen  and  Lupton,  1996;  Rose,  2007b,  2008 .  When  digital  technologies  designed  for self-tracking biometric data enter into this  field, these ideals are elaborated in response,  configuring the ideal of the ‘socially fit citi- zen’,  a  new,  digitised  form  of  biocitizen- ship. More recent forms of self-administered   health  promotion  and  patient  self-care  have  focused attention on the ways in which digi- tal technologies can be employed to achieve  good  health,  supporting  the  notion  of  the  digitally  engaged  patient. The  discourses  of  ‘patient  empowerment’  and  ‘engagement’  and the importance of people taking respon- sibility for their health recur in such accounts   see, for example, Swan, 2009; Househ et al.,  2014 . In these programs, morality, responsi- bility,  accountability  and  concepts  of  health  and  intertwined   Lupton,  2012a;  2013a,  2013b,  2016a .  These practices are emphasised to the exclu- sion of other ways of caring for human sub- jects,  such  as  collective  or  state-supported  initiatives  McGregor, 2001 .  inextricably   illness  are   When  the  meaning  of  social  fitness  is  expanded to incorporate the use of new digi- tal  media  for  facilitating  social  interactions  and  networks,  these  moral  meanings  also  enter into digitised sharing and participation  systems.  Idealised  biocitizens  are  socially  fit  because  they  are  appropriately  socially- engaged  using  technologies  such  as  social  media,  as  well  as  performing  the  attributes  of healthy and responsible citizens who are  willing to share their data for the interests of  others  or  to  provide  encouraging  feedback  about  other  people  to  help  motivate  them.  Socially fit biocitizens take steps to employ  self-tracking devices and technologies as well  as social media to contribute to personalised  digital data assemblages that enable them to  manage and optimise their bodily health and  wellbeing.  They  may  encourage  others  on  social media by engaging in communal self- tracking, or contribute their personal data to  large data sets that are then used to develop  new knowledges about health and medicine.  In this discourse, the ‘self-knowledge’ cham- pioned by the Quantified Self movement and  other advocates for self-tracking should not  only  benefit  the  individual:  it  should  also  contribute to collective knowledge stores.  The affordances of new digital media and  their intersections with the digital data econ- omy,  however,  complicate  and  extend  the    574  potentialities and consequences of social fit- ness. There is a fine line between voluntary,  pushed  and  imposed  self-tracking.  When  financial  incentives  are  offered,  or  social  pressures  are  brought  to  bear  on  individuals  to engage in self-tracking, there is often little  room to make a choice. In the case of employ- ees who are encouraged to engage in fitness  self-tracking  as  part  of  corporate  wellness  programs,  or  children  who  are  handed  heart  rate  monitors  in  physical  education  lessons,  encouragement  can  quickly  become  imposi- tion.  People  who  do  not  participate  or  who  fail to meet pre-set targets for fitness or other  health-  or  productivity-related  data  may  be  discriminated against with social disapproval  or financial penalties. Given that the impetus  in these instances does not come from the indi- vidual but from those in positions of power,  this also raises the question of how effective  such practices are in helping people achieve  self-knowledge  or  change  their  lives  for  the  better. Forcing change on people is likely to  be  far  less  effective  than  allowing  them  to  make a choice  Frakt and Carroll, 2014 .  All three of these modes can be taken up in  communal  or  exploited  self-tracking  modes.  The  possibilities  of  the  types  of  use  of  per- sonal  health  and  medical  information  that  I  have  outlined  are  rarely  raised  by  actors  and  agencies  who  are  seeking  to  encourage   nudge  or  even  coerce   people  to  engage  in  self-tracking.  The  ways  in  which  personal  value  that  self-trackers  gain  from  develop- ing their self-knowledge in the quest for self-  optimisation is expropriated for the profit of  others or used to discriminate against people  tend not to be highlighted in the discourses of  sharing and caring that recur in social fitness  discussions. Self-trackers may not be aware of  who is viewing or using the types of personal  information that they share on social media.  fuTure direcTions  Important questions emerge from the analy- sis  I  have  presented  here.  If  moral  precepts   are  brought  to  bear  on  people  to  encourage  them to engage in self-tracking and personal  data  sharing  as  socially  fit  biocitizens  by  government, research and commercial agen- cies,  what  are  the  attendant  precepts  that  should  be  highlighted  by  these  agencies  to  alert  or  warn  people  of  the  potential  uses   both legal and illicit, both overt and covert   of the highly intimate personal data that are  produced  by  these  practices?  What  are  the  ethics and values that need to be confronted  and assessed in this situation? What responsi- bilities should be borne by those who advo- cate  for  the  socially  fit  citizen?  To  what  extent  will  it  become  increasingly  difficult  for people to opt out of participating in social  fitness  programs,  and  what  are  the  possible  harms that may eventuate from this form of  pushed  or  coerced  self-tracking?  What  are  the ways in which self-tracking can be used  for  radical  activist  purposes  that  challenge  existing  norms  and  assumptions  concerning  personal  responsibility  for  health  status?  How  will  the  expansion  of  the  Internet  of  Things  contribute  to  the  generation  of  increasingly detailed information on people’s  bodies  and  everyday  practices  and  the  exchange of these data between humans and  between  inanimate  ‘smart’  objects?  All  of  these  questions  provide  the  basis  for  future  critical  analysis  of  the  entanglements  of  social media with self-tracking technologies.  references  Adhikari, R., Richards, D. and Scott, K.  2014   Security and privacy issues related to the use  of  mobile  health  apps.  25th  Australasian  Conference  on  Information  Systems,  Auck- land, New Zealand.

This very broad  question  has  been  addressed  by  academics  from a variety of disciplines. In this chapter,  we will first give an overview of the different  ways in which this question has been tackled.  Most  scholars  have  studied  the  impact  of  social media as tools, assessing their imme- diate impact on learning. While some predict  they may potentially revolutionize education,  others  see  them  as  potential  minefields. We  want  to  introduce  an  approach  to  social  media that does not just regard them as tools,  but as platforms, driven by a complex inter- play  between  technical  architectures,  busi- ness  models,  and  mass  user  activity.  These  automated architectures, models, and activi- ties introduce new mechanisms in social life   van Dijck & Poell, 2013 . Beyond affecting  student  behaviour  and  teaching  practices,  they also impact the organization of schools  and  universities  and,  one  might  argue,    public  education as such. We will highlight  two  mechanisms  that  are  increasingly  rele- vant in online teaching environments: datafi- cation and commodification. To illustrate our  approach,  we  will  first  focus  on  primary  education, then on higher education.  To illustrate how datafication affects edu- cation,  we  discuss  a  Californian  initiative  called AltSchool, a platform that is currently  gaining traction in the US. AltSchool, which  has been touted the ‘Uber for primary educa- tion’,  is  an  interesting  case  because  it  is  an  initiative that is potentially scalable to other  countries  and  is  backed  by  major  Silicon  Valley  investors.  The  platform  thrives  on  datafication: learning processes are translated  into data processes and turned into tracking  systems  that  continuously  relate  individual  progress  to  standardized  performance.  The  technological  architecture  of  the  platform  directly  informs  its  pedagogical  philosophy  of personalized data tracking – a mechanism  that dominates the entire ecosystem of con- nective  media. We  will  identify  and  discuss    580  the pros and cons of data-driven personalized  educational  platforms  such  as  AltSchool  in  primary education.  Next,  we  will  focus  on  how  commodifi- cation  operates  as  a  mechanism  in  Massive  Open Online Courses  or MOOCs  in higher  education; MOOCs such as Coursera deploy  the  same  principles  of  datafication  and  per- sonalization  as  AltSchool,  but  their  impact  can be observed outside American universi- ties, in Europe and other continents. MOOCs  are  promoted  as  an  efficient  and  effective  form of higher education – allegedly cheaper  than  courses  and  curriculums  offered  by  brick-and-mortar universities. Zooming in on  the  principle  of  commodification,  we  argue  that  MOOCs  operate  business  and  govern- ance  models  that  are  very  similar  to  social  media platforms. The ways in which MOOCs  incorporate  social  media  mechanisms  may  affect the pedagogical and economic value of   institutional  college education.  Beyond pedagogy and economics lies the  question of education as a public good. How  do online educational platforms relate to key  public  values  sustaining  school  systems?  These  values  are  subject  to  fierce  contesta- tion,  raising  fundamental  questions  such  as  privacy  protection  and  academic  inde- pendence.  Online  education  has  become  an  intricate  battleground  for  waging  private,  corporate,  and  public  interests  in  an  online  economy where technological interoperabil- ity is expedited by larger social trends such  as privatization and globalization. These dis- putes are likely to have a substantial impact  on  the  definition  of  online  education  as  a  public good.  social media’s impacT on  educaTion: Tools or plaTforms?  Since their emergence, the role of social plat- forms  in  all  types  of  education  has  been  extensively  debated  by  academics  and  pro- fessionals  for an overview, see Davis et al.,   2012 . Disputes on the ‘promises and perils’  of  social  media  and  their  impact  on  class- room learning have intensified in accordance  with  the  growth  of  these  media  since  2004.  On  the  ‘promises’  side,  researchers  have  investigated whether social networking plat- forms can be turned into efficient and effec- tive  tools  for  knowledge  enhancement  and  classroom discussion  Tess, 2013 . The ubiq- uity of social media in virtually every aspect  of  children’s  and  teenager’s  lives  has  led  teachers  to  reflect  on  how  to  purposefully  integrate these tools into curricular activities   Gikas  &  Grant,  2013;  Mao,  2014 .  Some  argue that social media use plays a key role  in  helping  students  with  particular  educa- tional  tasks,  such  as  information  retrieval   Hrastinski & Aghaee, 2012 . On the ‘perils  side’  of  the  debate,  social  media  platforms  have  been  identified  as  a  constant  cause  of  dismay to teachers, triggering disruptions in  the  classroom   Junco,  2012 .  Others  con- clude that the potential of social media as a  means  of  sharing  academic  knowledge  has  not  been  actualized  yet   Forkosh-Baruch  &  Hershkovitz, 2012 . Both sides in this debate  adopt  a  social  media-as-tools  approach:  social media are considered as technical tools  that  may  either  enhance  or  disrupt  learning  experiences. So far, however, empirical evi- dence on the efficacy and efficiency of social  media  use  in  the  classroom  has  been  rather  scarce in the academic literature.  A  second  approach  to  social  media  in  relation  to  education  and  learning  has  been  the  ‘civic  engagement’  approach.  Large  social  media  networks  such  as  Facebook  and Twitter have been hailed as drivers of a  new,  socially  engaged  educational  experi- ence,  fostering  the  capacity  for  discussion  and  connection  among  youngsters   Friesen  & Low, 2012; Vanwynsberghe & Verdegem,  2013 .  Twitter,  particularly,  has  been  found  helpful in fostering in-class discussions and  engaging  students  with  their  learning  tasks   Kassens-Noor,  2012 .  Most  discussions  on  how  social  media  nurture  student  engage- ment fit the larger argument on online media    soCial Media PlatForMs and eduCation   581  and  civic  engagement,  a  discussion  meticu- lously  described  by  Bennett   2008   and  Jenkins   2009 .  Bennett  argues  that  social  media are not simply ‘tools’ for engagement,  but  they  are  themselves  part  of  a  changing  institutional  and  political  landscape  where  they may embody both supportive and criti- cal attitudes towards education. According to  Bennett,  researchers  should  examine  social  media  networks  not  apart  from  institutional  changes,  but  as  an  integral  part  of  socio-  economic and political transformations.  The approach taken in this chapter extends  Bennett’s ideas on civic engagement, regard- ing social media not as  technical  tools but  as platforms. Online social media platforms  are  more  than  mere  technical  facilitators:  they  are  simultaneously  technological,  eco- nomic,  and  socio-cultural  frameworks  for  managing  online  social  traffic   Gillespie,  2010 . Thousands of platforms have prolifer- ated on the Web since the turn of the millen- nium,  forming  an  ecosystem  of  connective  media through which people perform a large  part  of  their  everyday  lives,  including  com- munication  and  educational  activities   van  Dijck,  2013a .  All  platforms  are  equally  defined  by  a  set  of  mechanisms,  which  we  have described in more detail elsewhere  van  Dijck and Poell, 2013 . In the remainder of  this  chapter,  we  want  to  analyze  how  these  mechanisms  shape  education,  affecting  not  online learning and teaching in school envi- ronments, but the organization of primary and  higher education more generally. In doing so,  we  will  concentrate  on  two  mechanisms  in  particular: datafication and commodification. Datafication  –  the  tendency  to  quantify  all  aspects  of  social  interaction  and  turn  them into code – is one of the basic mecha- nisms undergirding social platforms  Mayer- Schoenberger  &  Cukier,  2013;  van  Dijck,  2014 .  This  principle  is  becoming  more  popular in school curriculums at every stage  of  education,  from  kindergarten  to  univer- sity.  Indeed,  as  Selwyn   2015:  66   argues,  ‘schools, colleges, universities and other edu- cational  contexts  now  function  increasingly   along  “data  driven”  lines’.  Large  quantities  of data are generated and collected on a daily  basis,  not  only  by  and  through  schools,  but  also by  or in collaboration with  companies  that are keen on gathering information from  youngsters.  Data  sets  range  ‘from  the  often  ad hoc “in-house” monitoring of students and  teachers  to  the  systematic  “public”  collec- tion of data at local, state and federal levels’   Selwyn, 2015: 66 .  As educational assessment is increasingly  quantified,  student  performance  gets  gov- erned  by  numbers   Robert-Holmes,  2015 .  Quantitative  learning  analytics,  grounded  in large numbers of students’ online behav- ioral  data,  involve  data  tracking   real-time  analytics   as  well  as  predictive  analytics   Tempelaar, Rienties & Giesbers, 2015 . For  instance, data tracking can be used to register  fine-grained  information  about  the  amount  of time a student needs to solve a problem,  to  record  the  cognitive  stages  in  problem  solving,  to  measure  the  amount  of  instruc- tion needed, and to trace student interaction   Koedinger, McLaughlin & Stamper, 2014a .  Predictive analytics may result in algorithmic  calculations defining an individual’s chances  for academic success based on average scores  and  a  number  of  variables. These  emerging  digital policy instruments transfer the assess- ment of didactic and pedagogical values from  teachers  and  classrooms  to   commercial   online platforms deploying real-time and pre- dictive analytics techniques. The general idea  of  data-driven  platform  services  is  to  allow  for  modification  and  corrective  action  of  learning activities; they provide the as of yet  unrealized  potential  to  radically  transform  learning  processes  and  pedagogies   Maull,  Godsiff & Mulligan, 2014 .  The  ability  to  monitor  individuals  and  groups  at  a  microlevel  obviously  includes  competence  scores  and  performance  lev- els,  but  may  also  pertain  to  stress  levels,  speed  variations,  and  heart  rates.  The  sheer  unlimited  combination  of  data  sets  may  cause  a  paradigm  shift  in  education.  Some  researchers  have  hailed  the  datafication  of    582  educational  processes,  emphasizing  how  personalized data analytics informs learning  design and may facilitate specific pedagogi- cal  action   Lockyer,  Heathcote  &  Dawson,  2013 . Others have pointed out how a grow- ing emphasis on datafication through online  platforms  and  platform  services  can  have  serious impact on the organization of educa- tion and increase managerialism and dataveil- lance   Selwyn,  2015 .  Finally,  a  number  of  researchers have pointed towards the ethical  and legal challenges involved in data collec- tion  and  interpretation  in  educational  con- texts,  including  privacy  and  data  ownership   Siemens, 2013; Slade & Prinsloo, 2013 .  Datafication  as  a  mechanism  that  drives  social media platforms is closely intertwined  with the mechanism of commodification: the  monetization of online social traffic through  business  models  and  governance  structures.  Social  media  platforms  are  propelled  by  a  limited  number  of  business  models  that  are  mainly based on data as connective leverage to  generate  economic  value.  Commodification  in  the  context  of  educational  platforms  often  involves  the  processing  of  learning  data by large data hubs that render big data  streams  monetizable  and  potentially  profit- able. The  center  of  educational  governance,  as Williamson  2016: 123  argues, ‘is being  distributed  and  displaced  to  new  digitized  “centres  of  calculation”’.  Massive  informa- tion transfer to ‘calculation centres’ and data  hubs tallies with the concentration power in  a few large data companies which may serve  commercial rather than pedagogical interests   Lawson, Sanders & Smith, 2015 .  Educational  platforms  cannot  and  should  not be seen apart from the larger ecosystem of  connective media through which they thrive –   an  ecosystem  that  is  gradually  transform- ing all sectors of society and that is steered  by  the  same  set  of  mechanisms.  However,  this  system  is  not  a  level  playing  field  as  some platforms are more powerful than oth- ers.  Facebook,  Google, Apple, Amazon  and  Microsoft are pivotal gatekeepers in the data  flows  that  fuel  the  ‘platform  society’. Their   economic  interests  in  educational  platforms  are  huge  and  it  should  come  as  no  surprise  that  they  heavily  invest  in  the  development  and distribution of online education.  In  the  next  two  sections,  we  will  analyse  how  these  two  dominant  mechanisms  of  social  media  platforms  –  datafication  and  commodification – increasingly penetrate the  processes and institutional contexts of educa- tion. In the US in particular, datafication has  been  hailed  as  a  new  paradigm  in  primary  education, and AltSchool is a case in point.  Commodification is surfacing as a structuring  principle in online platforms targeting higher  education  across  the  globe,  a  development  illustrated by Coursera. Although AltSchool  and  Coursera  are  mere  examples,  we  think  that these platforms may elucidate the larger  trend of how social media mechanisms affect  the  transformation  of  the  educational  sector  in a platform-driven society.  daTaficaTion: alTschool as  a plaTform for primary  educaTion  Primary  schools  in  the  US  increasingly  incorporate  educational  software  into  their  curricula,  from  math  and  language  apps  to  customized online lessons. Along with edu- cational  software  came  data  trackers  and  ‘dashboards’;  instruments  that  record  and  analyze  thousands  of  pieces  of  data  about  each  student,  catering  to  their  abilities  and  tastes,  have  become  increasingly  popular.  Proponents of quantitative learning analytics  claim  they  are  a  significant  quality  booster  for students’ learning  Ebner & Schön, 2013;  Reamer  et  al.,  2015 .  Real-time  data  about  individual learning processes help instructors  monitor students’ progress and allow for cor- rective feedback. Personalized data allegedly  provide  unprecedented  insights  into  how  individual  students  learn  and  what  kind  of  tutoring they need. If the data show that one  student  is  better  at  solving  verbal  math    soCial Media PlatForMs and eduCation   583  personalized   problems  than  abstract  equations,  software  developers  can  adapt  the  assignments  and  implement  variations.  Aggregated  data  about  learning  behavior  provide  the  input  for  individual  ‘adaptive  learning’ schemes. As some advocates argue,  continuous measuring of performance levels  may  enhance  the  quality  of  instruction   Maull, Godsiff & Mulligan, 2014 . Taking a  cue  from  the  social  media  world,  some  schools are fully embracing datafication and  personalization as the core principles of their  pedagogy, and are eager to team up with tech  entrepreneurs to explore the datafied learning  concept.  AltSchool is a Californian initiative founded  in 2013 by Google’s former head of person- alization  Max  Ventilla;  it  has  drawn  much  attention,  if  not  for  its  educational  philoso- phy, then certainly for the names of its finan- cial  backers,  including  Mark  Zuckerberg’s  education-focused non-profit foundation and  the Founder’s Fund of entrepreneur and ven- ture  capitalist  Peter  Thiel.  AltSchool  envi- sions  and  enacts  a  one-classroom  setting  populated  by  teachers  but  without  adminis- trators; AltSchool  offers  no  facilities  except  for  an  iPad  or  Chromebook  for  each  child.  Instructed  through  a  weekly  ‘playlist’,  each  pupil  engages  in  individual  or  group  activi- ties that are tailored toward their unique capa- bilities.  Independent  projects  have  replaced  direct  group  instruction.  Teachers  supervise  the  learning  process;  student  performance  is  monitored  through  tracking  systems  that  minutely  analyze  each  child’s  tasks  and  results. Informed by these data, teachers keep  cards  of  each  child’s  progress  and  setbacks,  and  use  them  to  make  weekly  personalized  learning  plans  for  each  child.  This  means  for  some  pupils  that  math  gets  prioritized  over reading skills, and for others, the other  way  around   Lapowsky,  2015 .  Proponents  hail the process of datafication as a means to  make education more efficient by cutting out   ineffective tasks for each child individually.  More than just a classroom, AltSchool is an  experimental lab where teachers and students   are minutely observed: every activity is vide- otaped and analyzed. A large technical staff  develops  customized  educational  software  and  tweaks  learning  analytics  to  optimize  each  part  of  the  learning  process. The  tools  developed by this team are remarkably simi- lar to those deployed by social media compa- nies: a recommendation algorithm, not unlike  Netflix  or  Amazon,  that  takes  into  account  everything a child has already learned; data  analytics that eliminate the need for constant  testing; and reputation mechanisms that rate  the personal input of children while measur- ing their relative scores.  Although AltSchool is currently still in its  experimental stages and has only been tested  in small sections of privileged Bay Area dis- tricts, there is every intention of scaling and  spreading this model once it gets beyond the  testing  phase.  In  terms  of  educational  phi- losophy,  AltSchool  favors  technology  over  teachers;  online  personalized  learning  takes  over classroom instruction; and the primacy  of predictive analytics downgrades teachers’  professional judgment. In addition, individu- alized  learning  schemes  are  taking  priority  over  the  notion  of  a  curriculum  as  the  cor- nerstone  of  education.  All  these  principles  arguably  undermine  the  conventional  peda- gogical model still dominant in most brick-and-  mortar schools across the US. The comparison   with a disruptive platform uprooting the taxi  sector  inevitably  pops  up  when  educators  speak of ‘Uber-education.’  Detractors  of AltSchool  have  pointed  out  how  the  principle  of  datafication  advances  a  pedagogical  perspective  also  known  as  ‘learnification.’  Many  data-driven,  person- alized  education  initiatives  focus  on  learn- ing  rather  than  education,  and  on  processes  rather  than  on  teachers  and  students.  The   social   activity  of  learning  is  broken  into  quantifiable cognitive and pedagogical units,  such  as  instruction,  short  quizzes,  assign- ments, deliberation with other students, and  tests. The learnification model is predicated  on the real-time, short-term process of learn- ing rather than its long-term outcome, which    584  is, in most schools, to provide an education.  Education,  as  critics  argue,  involves  simul- taneous  nourishing  of  intellectual,  social,  technical,  and  cognitive  skills.  The  ‘learni- fication’  of  education,  according  to  some  social  scientists  and  philosophers,  sprouts  from the idea that learning can be managed,  monitored, controlled, and ultimately modi- fied in each student’s personal mind  Attick,  2013; Biesta, 2012; Mead, 2014 .  Datafication appears to be a double-edged  sword.  Indeed,  personalized  assignments  based  on  quantitative  measurements  help  improve  each  individual’s  learning  process  and  outcomes.  However,  personalization  algorithms  are  based  on  inference  of  users’  needs or interests – supporting the prediction  of needs rather than solving the demand for  remedial  teaching. A  by-product  of  person- alized  learning  algorithms  may  be  that  they  ‘filter out what is not designated as being of  interest to users and rather presents to them  only  what  fits  the  system’s  belief  of  what  their  interests  are’   Ashman  et  al.,  2014:  824 . In addition, the biggest challenge that  software  developers  face  is  the  rather  para- doxical  demand  of  mass  individualization:  the question is how the AltSchool approach  will  scale  up  to  schools  populated  by  thou- sands of students. Will it benefit not just priv- ileged Bay Area students whose parents are  able to afford the experimental school’s hefty  fees, but also children from underprivileged  and underfunded schools?  Besides the ideological criticism concern- ing  this  learnification  paradigm,  research- ers have raised various other concerns, such  as  privacy  violations  and  selective  rank- ing   Siemens,  2013 .  Students  enrolled  in  AltSchool  and  similar  initiatives  are  prone  to  constant  monitoring,  to  the  extent  that  they become  unwitting  participants in con- tinuous lab experiments. Over the past years,  online education has shown a conclusive shift  toward  continuous  behavioral  experiments   Ebben  &  Murphy,  2014 .  Using  students  for  research  experiments  is  nothing  new.  However,  the  continuous  tracking  of  young   children  raises  important  ethical  questions;  issues of privacy and repurposing of data have  raised concerns from parents and regulators  alike   Ashman  et  al.,  2014;  Selwyn,  2015 .  Student and teacher performance are increas- ingly  monitored  through  dashboards  and  assessments  are  based  on  behavioral  track- ing  mechanisms  and  automated  classroom  surveys  –  techniques  already  introduced  in  many  elementary  schools  throughout  the  United States and that have triggered serious  controversy  Rich, 2015; Singer, 2015 .  Datafication  and  personalization  mecha- nisms  such  as  reputational  ranking  or  rec- ommendation  systems  are  informed  by  the  techno-commercial  logic  of  social  media  platforms.  On  most  social  networking  sites,  such  as  Facebook  or  Google+,  assessments  happen  instantly  and  continuously,  mostly  on the basis of perception or likability. Other  popular platforms, such as Uber and Airbnb,  deploy user recommendations to anchor repu- tation and trustworthiness: customers review  their drivers or hosts, who, in turn, can check  their customers’ online reputations  Coetzee  et  al.,  2014 .  But  what  happens  when  we  transfer  this  principle  to  an  online  learning  environment?  And  how  does  it  affect  the  traditional   hierarchical   dynamics  between  teacher, students, and institution? Educating  is  a  process  very  different  from  liking  or  recommending. Students do not always like  what they learn; learning often requires end- less practice or involves unexpected encoun- ters  with  content  that  only  much  later  turns  out to be very valuable. In short, the instan- taneity  of  recommendations  and  likability   of perceptions – the need for instant gratifi- cation – may be squarely at odds with long- term pedagogical values of curriculum-based  education.  Also  unresolved  are  the  ethical  issues  involved  in  the  ownership  of   meta data  and  their  accessibility,  which  can  be  quite  thorny.  One  of  the  advantages  claimed  by  online courses is that students’ performance  is  not  just  assessed  in  terms  of  grades  or  learning  outcomes,  but  can  be  evaluated  in    soCial Media PlatForMs and eduCation   585  terms  of  learning  curves  and  social  adapt- ability. Datafication of the learning process –   minutely monitoring the interactive and cog- nitive  behavior  of  pupils  –  yield  an  abun- dance of data beyond mere test results. How  fast  do  students  answer  a  quiz  question?  How autonomous or collegial are they when  it  comes  to  problem  solving?  Behavioral  data  are  a  sort  of  by-product  of  continuous  monitoring, and students are barely aware of  these  data  being  accumulated,  interpreted,  and  repurposed   Ashman  et  al.,  2014 .  In  fact,  dashboards  may  produce  behavioral  information that is far more interesting than  a  straightforward  grade  point  average.  It  is  already completely normal for employers to  scrutinize  a  potential  employee’s  postings  on  Facebook  and  LinkedIn  and  reject  can- didates on the basis of social media appear- ances   Swallow,  2011  van  Dijck,  2013b .  Therefore, it is not at all difficult to imagine  that  future  employers  might  request  a  full  performance record from kindergarten up to  college  to  assess  an  employee’s  intellectual  and social adaptability.  commodificaTion: coursera   and The impacT of moocs on  higher educaTion  Many  of  the  same  mechanisms  involving  datafication and personalization can be iden- tified  in  the  platforms  for  higher  education  that  we  have  come  to  call  Massive  Open  Online  Courses   MOOCs .  Platforms  like  Coursera, Udacity, and edX started to pene- trate the higher education sector in 2012. In  this section, we want to focus on the mecha- nism of commodification: the transformation  of  objects,  activities,  and  ideas  into  data  streams with the intent to turn them into trad- able commodities. Over the past four years,  MOOCs  have  become  popular  vehicles  for  online learning, and they frequently promote  themselves  as  future  alternatives  to  or  even  replacements  of  college  education.  A  large   number of universities, both in the US and in  Europe,  have  started  to  collaborate  with  mostly  American-based  MOOCS.  For  the  purpose of this chapter, we want to zoom in  on  Coursera  as  an  example  of  a  successful  platform whose business model is strikingly  similar  to  the  dominant  socio-economic  principles  connecting  all  platforms  on  the  social Web.  Coursera  is  a  for-profit  platform  that  started  in  2012  out  of  Stanford,  and  has  offered  online  courses  to  students  world- wide.  Initially  backed  by  four  American  universities,  it  engages  in  partnerships  with  universities  in  Europe,  South  America  and  Asia. Over the past four years, Coursera has  experimented  with  various  business  models  and  is  still  finetuning  some  of  its  monetiz- ing  schemes.  Similar  to  Facebook,  Google,  and  other  major  platforms,  Coursera  offers  content that is free to end-users; students can  enroll and follow videotaped lectures, engage  in online exercises, and take tests. Typically,  a  university  organizes  the  educational  con- tent  featured  in  courses,  while  Coursera  provides  the  online  means  for  attracting  a  mass audience. User acquisition is critical to  achieve network effects, as we have learned  from  social  media  platforms   Clow,  2013 .  Similarly, MOOCs have a vested interest in  massive numbers of users in order to obtain  large sets of  learning  data and student pro- files.  Students  and  young  professionals  are  arguably the most coveted target population  of data industries, and their attention is very  valuable. To optimize their metrics, it is cru- cial for Coursera to attract large quantities of  students with free content. The more  meta  data they collect, the more they learn about  users   Koedinger,  McLaughlin  &  Stamper,  2014b .  Still in the early stages of its development,  Coursera  deploys  a  variety  of  value-capture  strategies,  one  of  which  is  the  freemium  model. A  premium  variant  expands  the  free  option  by  offering  extra  paid-for  services  such  as  so-called  ‘signature  tracks’,  where  students  pay  for  certificates  of  completion,    586  proctored  exams,  and  identity  verification.  Proctored  exams  and  verified  certificates  are  gradually  developed  into  –  potentially  profitable – units that can be marketed glob- ally.  Another  business  model  is  to  collect  and  trade  user  data.  Coursera’s  user  policy  states  that  it  may  collect  ‘student-generated  content,  such  as  assignments  you  submit  to  instructors,  peer-graded  assignments  and  peer  grading  student  feedback  …  course  data,  such  as  student  responses  to  in-video  quizzes, standalone quizzes, exams and sur- veys’  Coursera Privacy, 2015 . It is unclear  whether  Coursera  is  currently  monetizing  its  wealth  of  student  data,  sharing  it  with  third parties. Advertising in online content is  another  option  which  Coursera  has  not  uti- lized yet, but which, as some point out, may  be  a  lucrative  value  proposition   Kalman,  2014 . Like most MOOCs, Coursera is fully  absorbed  in  the  ecosystem  of  connective  media where Facebook and Google dominate  online advertising.  Part  of  Coursera’s  revenues  comes  not  from  end-users  but  from  universities.  First,  universities pay for the content offered on the  site, and with an average of US$50,000 per  online  course,  MOOCs  do  not  come  cheap.  According  to  Bogen   2015 ,  Coursera’s  contracts  with  universities  ‘promise  6–15%  in  revenue-sharing  per  course  with  the  uni- versity  and  20%  of  gross  profits  on  aggre- gate sets of courses, paid out every quarter.’  Coursera thus draws over 80% from its online  course  profits.  Universities  consorting  with  Coursera  pay  for  the  development  of  their  course content as well as for instructors who  process  student  feedback  and  questions  –   a  massive  effort  that  is  not  always  recog- nized properly. In 2015, Coursera started to  offer a degree MA-program in collaboration  with  Georgia  Tech  University  in  exchange  for  an  unknown  percentage  of  tuition  fees.  Universities, in other words, invest heavily in  Coursera’s business model.  How  does  a  MOOC’s  value  proposition  differ  from   and  profit  from   the  pricing  system that sustains traditional universities?   Regular universities offer a ‘bundled’ educa- tional experience – an experience that comes  complete  with  lecture  halls,  facilities,  and  libraries  and  labor-intensive  courses  where  instructors  give  feedback  and  for  which  they  proctor  and  grade  exams  to  result  in  a  diploma  degree   in  some  instances,  course  certificates and transfer credits . For this all- inclusive  package,  students  pay  tuition  and  fees;  in  the  case  of  public  education,  tax- payers  fund  the  institutions  to  make  higher  education  more  affordable  to  citizens.  The  conventional business model reflects the ide- ology  of  higher  education  as  a  curriculum- based, comprehensive experience that offers  an education at a price that includes not only  lectures  or  course  content  but  certification,  advising,  tutoring,  and  testing   Boullier,  2012; Decker, 2014 .  Coursera’s  value  proposition  runs  paral- lel to social media platforms’ revenue mod- els.  Content  is  free  to  end-users;  money  is  made  from  offering  premium  services  and  from  leveraging  data  value  to  interested  third parties. By the same token, Coursera’s  model  parallels  the  way  Facebook  and  Google  promote  the  ‘unbundling’  of  con- tent, for instance news and publishing indus- tries:  news  articles  and  advertisements  no  longer  come  in  a  bundled  package,  but  are  resdistributed  via  Facebook’s  News  Feed  and  Google’s  PageRank  algorithms.  The  intricate  intertwining  between  datafica- tion  and  commodification  as  underpinning  mechanisms  illustrates  how  the  ecosystem  of connective platforms is fueled by techno- economic forces. As we saw in the example  of AltSchool, the accumulation of behavioral  learning data culled from participants all over  the world can be sold to businesses competing  for global talent. The appetite for educational  data  as  valuable  resources  on  the  data  mar- ket is enormous. Combined with other data,  such  as  social  media  profiles  or  health  and  fitness data, the availability of learning data  may  render  CVs  to  future  employers  virtu- ally obsolete. The repurposing of student data  in the US context is a large grey legal area.     soCial Media PlatForMs and eduCation   587  As Young   2015   points  out,  privacy  law  is  simply outdated when it comes to platforms  like AltSchool and Coursera or other MOOCs. The widespread distribution and adoption  of educational platforms promoting a dynam- ics  based  on  these  mechanisms  will  likely  affect  not  only  students’  and  teachers’  rela- tionship  towards  learning,  but  also  towards  the  institutions  of  education.  As  Kalman   2014:  11–12   convincingly  argues,  the  logic of MOOCs tends to strip down higher  education  to  its  most  traditional  and  visible  components  –  video  lectures  and  exami- nations – some of which are offered for free  to  users.  Partnering  institutions  pay  for  the  costly  infrastructure  that  comes  with  higher  education.  Coursera  as  a  platform  charges  a percentage of course revenue – if there is   any  –  in  exchange  for  using  its  format  and  global distribution function, but they do not  contribute  anything  towards  the  ‘collective’  costs  of  producing  education.  So  whereas  the  educational  content  is  entirely  gener- ated and paid for by universities, Coursera’s  added value comes from unbundling and then  rebundling content, and offering this to stu- dents  worldwide.  The  real  costs  of  massive  open online courses remain obscure, because  they  are  largely  paid  for  by  academic  part- ner  institutions  and  by  students  in  the  form  of private data. Not unlike Uber and Airbnb,  Coursera can trade off valuable information  to third parties using student data as currency.  It is precisely this connective platform model  that has caused the disruption of entire sec- tors,  such  as  newspaper  publishing  and  the  music  industry   Dellarocas  &  van  Alstyne,  2013 .  The plaTformizaTion of  educaTion  The  mechanisms  of  datafication  and  com- modification, adapted from the ecosystem of  social  media  platforms,  may  foreshadow  a  profound  shift  the  organization  of   in   education.  Of  course,  single  platforms  like  AltSchool or Coursera can never account for  an  entire  institutional  transformation,  but  they  do  signal  a  larger  trend.  While  few  people believe Altschool and Coursera pose a  serious  threat  to  brick-and-mortar  educa- tional  institutions  the  way  Uber  and Airbnb  have disrupted the transportation and hospi- tality sectors, they are likely to have a strong  impact on the educational sector. Although it  is  impossible  to  predict  how  deeply  the  dynamics of ‘platformization’ will penetrate  the traditional structures of higher education,  three potential implications follow from the  analysis  above.  First,  educational  platforms  tend to subjugate their pedagogical principles  to  social  media  mechanisms;  second,  the  efficacy  of  educational  software  and  data  tracking systems in schools and universities  have so far been poorly tested but are never- theless  presented  as  much-needed  fixes  to  outdated  educational  institutions;  and  third,  the  incorporation  of  online  education  in  a  global  world  of  commercial  high-tech  plat- forms may transform the notion of education  as a public good.  To  start  with  the  first  potential  implica- tion:  schools  and  didactic  online  systems  tend  to  blend  in  with  the  techno-economic  and  socio-cultural  mechanisms  of  social  platforms,  particularly  the  mechanisms  of  datafication  and  commodification.  Social  networks  like  Facebook  and  Google+  have  already deeply penetrated the everyday lives  of  pupils  and  students   Tess,  2013 .  Inside  and  outside  schools,  youngsters  are  grow- ing  up  immersed  in  the  compelling  social  interaction these platforms offer in terms of  connecting, liking, rating and following each  other. Platforms like Facebook are predicated  on  mass  individualization,  allowing  person- alized  content  and  many-to-many  commu- nication  at  the  same  time.  Besides,  various  platforms  developed  by  Google  have  a  sig- nificant  presence  in  students’  lives,  offer- ing  free  services  such  as  Gmail,  Scholar,  Books,  and  LibraryLink  to  students,  teach- ers,  and  universities.  For  funding-deprived    588  institutions,  these  propositions  are  increas- ingly hard to resist, and the result is that cor- porate platforms such as Google, Facebook,  LinkedIn, and Microsoft are able to position  themselves  strategically,  at  the  gateways  of  educational infrastructures such as libraries,  administrative  and  communication  systems.  Free cloud services offer students the expe- diency  and  convenience  of  online  tools  that  they can access for ‘free’  Center on Law and  Information  Policy,  2013 . Advantages  not- withstanding,  it  is  increasingly  difficult  for  students to ‘opt out’ of an educational envi- ronment  that  is  inundated  with  connective  tools  if  they  feel  uncomfortable  about  trad- ing  privacy  for  access  and  dataveillance  for  convenience.  Second, many online educational tools are  currently  celebrated  as  much-needed  fixes  of a crumbling institution that has been, to a  large  extent,  underfunded.  However,  few  of  the   expensive   online  solutions  have  been  properly  tested;  their  short-term  gains  in  learning  progress  may  be  valued  intuitively  over  long-term  pedagogies.  Indeed,  online  learning  tools  undoubtedly  add  value  to  the  arsenals  of  teachers  and  researchers   Gikas  &  Grant,  2013;  Rennie  &  Morrison,  2013 .  Online tools, if carefully mixed with proven  pedagogical  methods  in  blended  learning  environments, may enhance the learning pro- cess not only for already advantaged students,  but  also  for  those  who  are  less  gifted  and  need more training. Pedagogical instruments  and funding contexts are interdependent vari- ables.  Education  has  always  been  and  will  always be a labor-intensive, local, and costly  affair, but costs and benefits are not a zero- sum game. The compelling rhetoric used by  Coursera’s  and AltSchool’s  promoters  often  makes  them  appear  as  ‘technological  solu- tionism’  to  the  problem  of  disadvantaged  students all over the world  Morozov, 2013 .  However,  online  educational  platforms  are  more than a story of technology; they are part  of  the  socio-economic  conditions  in  which  education  is  embedded  in  a  town,  state,  or  nation  Stohl, 2014 .  Finally,  we  need  to  reflect  on  how  the  incorporation  of  learning  tools  in  a  global  world  of  commercial  high-tech  platforms  may transform the notion of  public  educa- tion. The educational sector is equally prone  to  disruptive  innovation  as  the  hospitality  and  transportation  industries,  but  education  is fundamentally different from hotels or cars  in that it is also a public good. For instance,  when it comes to accreditation, standardized  credits, and valorized diplomas, education is  still  largely  governed  through  national  sys- tems,  which  are  regulated  and  validated  by  government institutions and subject to demo- cratic  control.  Particularly  in  Europe,  edu- cation  is  still  largely  a  public  sector,  while  in  the  US,  private  schools  and  universities  are  taking  up  a  proportionally  larger  share.  The  pressure  to  open  up  educational  stand- ards  and  regulation  to  global  commercial  high-tech  companies  is  an  important  strat- egy pursued by education platforms such as  AltSchool  and  Coursera  and  their  owners.  Using these platforms as examples may help  us understand how education is increasingly  defined  as  a  technological  challenge  devel- oped  by  tech  companies  and  decreasingly  as a service carried out by dedicated teach- ers  and  funded  by  taxes   Kolowich,  2013;  Meister, 2013 .  At a time when schools, universities, and  students  are  facing  serious  challenges  in  terms  of  funding,  a  proposition  that  seem- ingly  reduces  the  cost  of  teaching,  attracts  large enrollments, and offers free courses to  students seems irresistible. So it should come  as  no  surprise  that  the  ‘scalable’  and  ‘free’  logic  of  online  learning  modules  is  finding  inroads into many  private as well as public   school  systems. As  we  have  learned  above,  AltSchool  is  a  private  school  financially  backed by Google, attracting a high-end class  of pupils in Silicon Valley. In September 2015,  Facebook’s  Mark  Zuckerberg  announced  he  would  start  to  fund  the  Summit  Public  Schools in San Francisco – an initiative that  develops software to help individual children  learn at their own pace. Just like AltSchool,    soCial Media PlatForMs and eduCation   589  Facebook’s  new  platform-based  initiative  promises to help create tailored lessons and  projects, and administer individualized quiz- zes that special software can grade and track.  Developing educational software is a crucial  strategy to integrate the underpinning mecha- nisms  of  social  platforms  into  the  everyday  lives of young children and their institutional  environments.  Facebook and Google are also both heavily  investing in developing and financially sup- porting MOOCs, such as Coursera, Udacity,  and edX. Although they often invest in educa- tional platforms indirectly, through nonprofit  initiatives, it is clear that the intricate inter- wovenness  between  educational  platforms  and major connective platforms lies in their  interlocking dynamics. In sum, the battle for  domination in the world of online education  is  as  much  about  technological  and  eco- nomic mechanisms as it is about pedagogy,  effective  learning  strategies,  and  quality  teaching  Beetham & Sharpe, 2013 . Even if  online  platforms  will  never  replace  schools  or  universities,  they  will  likely  have  a  sub- stantial  impact  on  how  education  becomes  redefined  as  a  public  good.  By  regarding  social  media  as  platforms  rather  than  just  tools,  we  wanted  to  draw  attention  to  the  power of its underpinning dynamics.

Similarly, Twitter is used by many  researchers  for  live  reporting  of  academic  conferences  and  networking   e.g.,  Weller,  Dröge & Puschmann, 2011  or sharing links  to scholarly publications  Eysenbach, 2011 .  In some disciplines, researchers’ activities on  social  media  platforms  have  covered  up  to  97%  of  the  relevant  scholarly  literature,  which means that in those cases more articles  can be found in the social reference manager  Mendeley than in the traditional bibliographic  databases,  for  example  Web  of  Science  or  Scopus   Li,  Thelwall  &  Guistini,  2012 .  In  fact, more than 60,000 scholarly articles are  shared or discussed every week  Adie, 2015 . Therefore, alongside the traditional world  of formal papers and official journals, there   is  a  lively  parallel  universe  bustling  with  new forms of and outlets for scholarly com- munication  –  one  that  needs  to  be  explored  for both its potential and its perils. Thus, this  chapter provides an overview of how social  media  platforms  are  used  by  academics  in  different  contexts  and  on  the  reasons  and  purposes of researchers in attending to social  media. Particularly, we look at platforms that  are being used by scholars – this can be com- mon platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and  blogs or specific platforms explicitly aiming  at  academic  audiences,  such  as  Mendeley,  Academia.edu  and  ResearchGate.  We  will  ask about the role these platforms play in aca- demia  and  outline  the  positive  and  negative  effects of social media activity on scholarly  communication.  The  chapter  demonstrates  similarities  between  traditional  forms  of  scholarly communication – expressed mainly  in  form  of  publications  and  citations  –  and  new  ways  of  communicating  through  social  media. In both cases researchers leave differ- ent forms of traces which have the potential to    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   593  measure activity and impact and which shape  the   digital   identity  of  a  researcher. At  the  end of this chapter we will take a closer look  at the footprints and shadows as traces aca- demics leave while using social media – and  explain  how  this  relates  to  new  approaches  of measuring academic impact and how the  study of these ‘altmetrics’ contributes to the  understanding of scholarly communication in  social media.  Basics of Scholarly   Communication  Scholarly  communication  is  traditionally  based on academic writing that is published  and thereby shared with the academic com- munity.  Researchers  communicate  by  read- ing,  reflecting  on  and  finally  referencing  other researchers’ publications. The flow of  information within the scholarly community  can  be  retraced  by  studying  the  citations,  which  connect  different  publications:  an  author  who  includes  a  reference  to  another  publication in their work is assumed to have  received  the  information  from  that  original  publication.  Hence,  scholarly  communica- tion  can  be  characterized  as  perpetual  loop  of  publishing  and  citing  of  scholarly  literature.  By participating in scholarly communica- tion  and  generating  its  products  researchers  create their academic identities. The primary  outcomes of academic writing  publications   can  be  considered  as  footprints   Bar  Ilan  et al., 2012; Goodier & Czerniewicz, 2015   that  the  author  leaves  in  the  landscape  of  scholarly  knowledge. As  a  whole  they  mir- ror what the researcher does professionally –   their  scientific  contribution  –  and  draw  a  picture  of  their  expertise.  Publications  are  always linked to the author, who is bringing  them into reality. As such the author initiates  the publication and influences the appearance  of this part of their academic identity. Those  self-initiated  footprints  form  the  essential  foundation for scholarly exchange.  On  the  other  side,  it  is  the  citations  that  show  the  impact  a  publication  has  on  other  authors   Cronin,  1984 .  This  results  in  a  citation  identity  of  every  author   Cronin  &  Shaw,  2002   reflecting  how  other  research- ers  perceive  their  work  and,  again,  ends  up  in a certain impression of the author. Goodier  and  Czerniewicz   2015   speak  of  shadows  that  are  initiated  by  people  other  than  the  researcher. Accordingly, this part of the aca- demic  identity  cannot  be  controlled  by  the  researcher  herself himself.  Interestingly,  in  scholarly communication, leaving footprints  and  creating  shadows  are  two  sides  of  the  same  coin.  Since  authors  publish  original  material  by  referencing  known  literature,  they automatically develop shadows of other  researchers.  Moreover,  citations  indicate  some  sort  of  topical  relation  between  publications  and can thus be used to ‘navigate’ through  masses  of  publications,  for  example  with  special  search  engines  that  enable  search- ing  for  all  publications  which  cite  a  spe- cific paper, or searching for works that are  cited in  or citing  the same set of publica- tions, or by ranking publications based on  citations.  The  ability  to  retrieve  relevant  publications is a key for successful schol- arly  communication.  Academics  usually  have  to  search  for  publications  on  a  topic  of interest, and to find ways to constantly  monitor  new  publications  in  a  given  field  to  select  those  that  are  relevant.  While  solutions such as subscriptions to journals’  table of contents or search alerts can help to  monitor the field, the challenge of selecting  which  publications  to  read  remains.  And  as  publication  output  grows  exponentially   De Solla Price, 1963; Larivière, Haustein  &  Mongeon,  2015 ,  new  strategies  for  keeping  up  with  new  publications  and  selecting the most relevant in one’s field of  research  are  needed  to  face  the  challenge  of  information  overload.  Peer-based  rec- ommendations, for example through social  media, may become a welcome support in  this effort.   594  It should also be noted that citations have  become a sort of currency in academic life.  They are no longer a mere trace of informa- tion flows between different researchers and  their publications, but have become one of the  most frequently used units for creating indi- cators of scholarly impact  De Bellis, 2009 .  The effects this may have and the drawbacks  and  limitations  of  different  citation-based  metrics are discussed and studied in the fields  of scientometrics and bibliometrics  Cronin &   Sugimoto, 2015; Leydesdorff, 1995 . Traditionally,  monographs  and   journal  articles  have  been  the  most  common  pub- lication  formats   Harmon  &  Gross,  2007;  Meadows,  1974 ,  though  preferences  may  vary  across  disciplines  and  additional  for- mats  e.g., conference papers  have emerged  over  time.  Traditional  publication  processes  rely on professional publishers as outlets. In  addition, peer review has widely been adapted  as a standard way for quality control of what  should be published and what not. Both, the  commercial  role  of  publishers  and  the  peer  review  process,  have  been  subject  to  public  critiques recently. Peer review processes have  been criticized for being slow, biased or insuf- ficient  to  identify  flaws  in  scientific  studies.  Publishers are being criticized for overcharg- ing  access  to  academic  publications  and  for  thus  dividing  the  research  community  into  those  who  can  afford  access  fees  and  those  who cannot, which has in turn led to the for- mation of the ‘open access’ movement, pos- tulating novel modes for financing publishing  processes  to  enable  access  to  the  resulting  publications  free  of  charge  for  the  reader   apparently  already  with  some  effect  on  scholarly communication as a whole as open  access articles appear to attract more citations  [Davis & Walters, 2011; Eysenbach, 2006] .  While academics publish at a growing rate  and speed, and while dissatisfaction with pub- lishing  formats  and  access,  citation  counts  and peer review is constantly expressed, new  developments can be observed which already  have  a  significant  influence  on  scholarly  communication.  Effects of Social Media in   Scholarly Communication  The  activities  that  make  the  researcher  part  of  the  scholarly  communication  ecosystem  and  that  form  the  academic  identity  of  an  author consist of countable units, for exam- ple the number of publications and citations.  These  output  units  are  inevitably  linked  to  the  elements  of  the  research  life-cycle  of  writing, consuming, understanding, and ref- erencing  publications.  The  publication  and  referencing  structures  that  have  been  well  established  over  centuries  are  increasingly  being challenged by new tools and practices  in  online  communication  environments.  As  we  will  see  below,  different  social  media  platforms  –  such  as  blogs,  wikis,  and  the  various types of social networking sites – are  having different effects on scholarly commu- nication – in general, we can speak of a posi- tive  feedback  loop  of  more  output  units    e.g.,  publications  acting  as  footprints  as  introduced  above   generating  more  units  of  visibility  i.e., shadows like citations  leading  to a better findability  of footprints , as well  as  increased  reputation   of  footprints  via  shadows .  As  such,  social  platforms  are  influencing  at  least  the  following  seven  dimensions  of  scholarly  communication   modified from Peters & Heise, 2014 :  1  The production of published material.  Social  media  and  other  collaborative  platforms  allow  for  new  ways  of  working  together  in  groups.  Although tools for collaborative writing existed  before the term social media was made popular   Digital  Research Tools,  n.d. ,  new  possibilities  to  work  together  on  a  manuscript  have  come  up as the landscape of social media tools grew  richer.  Researchers  may  share  their  drafts  and  ideas with co-authors through various channels   e.g.,  via  Academia.edu’s  comments ,  or  may  have   near  to   real-time  conversations  while  writing collaboratively  e.g., via chat in Google  Docs .  2  The process of searching for information or of  monitoring a research field. Researchers may use  their  peers   through  social  media   as  indicators  for  relevant  literature  and  recommendations    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   595  of  what  to  read.  Researchers  may  comment  on  useful  literature  via  Facebook,  Twitter  or  blogs.  Academic  social  networking  platforms  like  Academia.edu  or  ResearchGate  are  used  to  recommend  publications.  Increasingly,  the  personal network on the social media platforms  is also used to – illegally – obtain articles pub- lished behind a paywall  e.g., via Twitter hashtag  ‘icanhazpdf’ .  3  The ways to increase visibility of research results  and self-promotion.  As  social  media  platforms  are growing into systems that are used to spot  relevant  publications,  they  can  also  be  used,  in  reverse, to broadcast one’s own publications. By  communicating  about  academic  work  through  social  media  it  may  even  become  possible  to  reach  other  than  the  core  academic  audiences   e.g., via hashtags on Twitter, by addressing blogs  at a broader public audience, by including refer- ences in Wikipedia articles, or by answering FAQs  on ResearchGate .  4  The ways to connect with or to keep in touch with  other academics. Social networking sites such as  Facebook are used to establish or maintain rela- tionships  with  peers  and  other  acquaintances  and serve the need for comfortable, informal and  fast communication. Given that there are several  social  network  platforms  on  the  market  with  different  purposes  and  target  groups,  scholars  often  choose  the  platform,  their  persona  and  tasks carried out carefully, for example, differen- tiating between private and professional use on  Facebook  and  LinkedIn   Siegfried,  Mazarakis  &  Peters, 2015 . Since most social networking sites  allow people to build groups or categorize users  via  tags  or  lists,  efficient  information  exchange  and  dissemination  is  possible  by  channeling  information  to  relevant  users  or  filtering  out  what is of no interest.  5  The  available  publication  formats  and  their  accessibility. Blogs, status updates in social net- works,  wiki  articles  all  serve  different  purposes  of scholarly communication and can be used to  publish  pieces  of  information  of  different  sizes,  formats and styles. This may also include multi- media formats, for example, videos of a talk on  YouTube that supports a written paper. Access to  social  media  contents  is  typically  not  restricted  through paywalls. But other restrictions may be  imposed by the different access settings in social  media  that  may  make  content  only  visible  to  certain groups of users.  6  The ways to respond to academic publications  across a variety of social media channels. With  different publication formats also come different  ways  to  respond  to  publications.  It  is  possible  to  respond  to  a  journal  article  through  com- menting  in  tweets,  blog  posts  or  other  status  updates. Sometimes comments are also encour- aged ahead of a formal publication as new forms  of  open  peer  review.1  And  of  course  it  is  also  possible  to  use  a  tweet  to  comment  on  a  blog  post, to blog about a scholarly talk published on  YouTube or to apply other cross-platform types of  response  Hall et al., 2016 . In this way, citations  in  social  media  environments  are  getting  much  more  complex  than  in  traditional  publication  formats  Mahrt, Weller & Peters, 2014 .  7  The ways to measure publication output and  impact of scholarly work.  As  new  publication  formats  and  new  ways  to  cite  them  emerge,  it  should also be reassessed how scholarly output  is being measured and evaluated. The term ‘alt- metrics’ has been coined to refer to new indica- tors based  among others  on social media data   Priem et al., 2010 .  academic uses of social   media plaTforms  As the Time magazine prominently put it in  2006,  social  media  is  about  ‘YOU’.2  The  fundamental property of social media is the  ego  and  the  content  or  activity  the  person  generates  on  the  web   Schmidt,  2009 .  Usually,  a  user  profile  is  the  entry  ticket  to  the social media platform, allowing only reg- istered  users  to  approach  other  users  and  access  the  available  content.  Around  these  profiles  the  online  identity  of  the  person  emerges,  since  the  social  media  platforms  track,  record  and  display  all  user  activities  performed  by  the  user  himself  or  her  con- tacts.  These  contacts  can  either  be  estab- lished via a mutual relationship  e.g., friends  on  Facebook   or  a  one-sided  relation   e.g.,  followers  on  Twitter .  Besides  setting  up  a  profile and generating original content, social  media platforms always also allow for shar- ing,  that  is  re-distributing  or  forwarding    596   Puschmann  &  Peters,  2015   content  pro- duced  by  other  users  of  the  platform.  Both  generating and sharing content are character- istic for social media. And both also fit well  into the context of scholarly communication,  which is about sharing and consuming con- tent  as  well  as  about  establishing  ‘profiles’  for individual researchers.  The  following  selection  of  prototypical  social  media  platforms  reflect  these  charac- teristics  particularly  well  and  therefore  will  be discussed against the background of their  use  in  academia.  The  most  popular  social  media  platforms  are  not  focusing  on  a  spe- cific  target  audience.  Facebook,  YouTube,  blogs or Twitter are popular across many dif- ferent  demographic  populations   although  Facebook was initially created for university  students . And of course some of their users  are also academics. Many of them may have  started  using  social  networks  like  Facebook  for private purposes – before more and more  colleagues would connect with them and pri- vate and professional communication became  increasingly inseparable. While some schol- ars  may  simply  improvise  how  they  use  social  media  in  their  daily  routines,  oth- ers  turn  to  specific  guidelines  for  academic  usage of social media, such as, for example,  the one by Bik and Goldstein  2013 . There  even  exist  guidelines  for  specific  platforms  targeted at scholars from specific disciplines,  like König’s  2012  guidelines for historians.  Some may try to keep professional communi- cation and private communication separate –   either  by  establishing  different  accounts  within  the  same  platform  or  by  turning  to  different social media platforms for different  purposes – and some may have given up on  these efforts after a while.  The  use  of  social  media  platforms  is  strongly task-driven. Hence, researchers can  have profiles on different platforms and use  them in a varying intensity  Pscheida et al.,  2014; Siegfried, Mazarakis & Peters, 2015 .  Some  initiatives  aim  at  systematically  allo- cating social media tools to the elements and  activities of the research life-cycle, reflecting   what  platform  is  used  for  which  task   e.g.,  101Innovations.wordpress.com .  However,  truly  distinct  assignments  are  difficult  to  make,  mainly  due  to  the  broad  spectrum  of  functionalities  the  social  media  platforms  offer.  Literally,  most  of  them  successfully  serve more than one purpose  Peters & Heise,  2014 .  However, as social media platforms evolve  over  time  and  their  user  communities  also  constantly  develop  new  practices,  studies  on the adoption of social media platforms in  academia  such as the ones by Procter et al.,  2010a  and  2010b,  or  Pscheida  et  al.,  2014   can always only capture a certain snapshot at  one  point  of  time  –  and  are  often  also  con- fined to specific subgroups of academics,for  example in specific countries or specific dis- ciplines.  Among  the  existing  studies,  some  contain evidence that uptake on social media  usage  in  academia  has  been  rather  slow  in  many  cases,  while  some  disciplines  appear  as  early  adopters.  For  example,  Procter  et al.  2010b: 4044  observed that ‘computer  science  researchers  are  more  likely  to  be  frequent users and those in medicine and vet- erinary sciences less likely’. Given the case  study nature of many findings, generalizabil- ity of such research has to be discussed and  backed up with more evidence.  Furthermore,  determining  the  value  of  social media in scholarly communication by  using data about active users, or by counting  how many academics have user accounts on  specific  platforms,  is  problematic  in  itself.  Besides  the  lack  of  reliable  data  in  many  cases  e.g., when there is no open application  programming interface [API] available , it is  also of interest who consumes content from  social media sites, which in the case of read- ing blogs or Wikipedia can be done without  registering and can be considered much more  common  than  active  contributions   Weller  et al., 2010 . As Allen et al.  2013  point out,  social media in academic contexts are more  about pushing information  tailored to users’  interests   to  the  public,  which  distinguishes  them  from  traditional  literature  databases    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   597  where  users  would  usually  pull  informa- tion by active searching. Allen et al.  2013   also  conclude  that  this  is  how  social  media  increased  dissemination  of  scholarly  publi- cations  in  the  health  and  medical  domains.  Thus,  given  the  assumingly  large  share  of  passive  users  or  lurkers   Nielsen,  2006   on  social  media  platforms,  within  this  chapter  we will look at practices rather than at usage  statistics.  In  particular,  we  are  distinguishing  the  more text-based platforms that can be consid- ered as pioneers in the earlier years of social  media  mainly blogs and Wikipedia  from the  later platforms that are more centered around  network structures and can combine content- sharing  of  different  media  formats   e.g.,  multi-media  formats  in  Facebook  posts .  Furthermore,  we  distinguish  platforms  that  specialize  on  academic  users  from  those  addressing a general audience.  TexT-based social media  plaTforms as addiTions To  scholarly publicaTions  Blogs have been among the earliest phenom- ena to be labelled as elements of ‘Web 2.0’ or  the Social Web, and therefore are among the  first social media that were believed to chal- lenge  traditional   scholarly   communication  structures  Nardi et al., 2004 . The idea was  that blogs could open up new possibilities for  sharing  scholars’  work  independently  from  traditional  publishers.  Blog  posts  may  look  very  similar  to  research  articles,  as  both  are  text-based and may include figures, tables and  references.  Blogs  offer  a  platform  to  write  about research, and to reach out to academic  and  non-academic  audiences  alike,  to  cross- reference through the use of hyperlinks, and  to receive immediate feedback from the com- munity  Shema, Bar-Ilan & Thelwall, 2015 . Blogs  rather  seem  to  complement  tradi- tional  publications  than  to  aim  at  replac- ing  them.  Being  free  from  constraints  in   traditional formats, blogs have been used and  interpreted in different ways by the academic  community.  Mewburn  and Thomson   2013   suggest  that  academic  bloggers  rather  write  about academic work conditions than about  their  own  research  findings,  and  that  they  like to give advice or share useful informa- tion with their audience. They also report on  their workflows in everyday lab-life or latest  readings,  and  use  their  blogs  to  informally  develop  and  test  ideas   Maitzen,  2012 .  Halavais  2006  uses several images to illus- trate academic uses of blogs: the ‘notebook’   a  place  for  work  in  progress ,  the  ‘coffee  house’   a  place  for  discussing  with  [often  like-minded]  academics ,  and  the  ‘opinions  page’  or  ‘editorial  page’   for  more  general  forms  of  public  communication .  Walker   2006  distinguishes blog types into ‘public  intellectuals’, ‘research logs’ and ‘pseudony- mous blogs about academic life’  and blogs  that  combine  these  different  genres .  Quite  interesting  is  the  phenomenon  of  anony- mous pseudonymous blogging to talk about  everyday  academic  life  and  the  frustrations  it may bring.  Overall,  it  remains  hard  to  define  what  precisely  constitutes  an  academic  blog,  or  research  blogging.  In  addition,  the  term  ‘science  blogging’  is  often  used  to  describe  blogs  covering  scientific  topics  in  general,  independent of whether their authors are ten- ured  professors,  grad  students,  high  school  teachers,  interested  laymen,  or  journalists   Mahrt & Puschmann, 2014 . Colson  2011   points out that there is a strong interrelation  between  blogging  researchers  and  science  journalists  who  interact  through  blogs.  Her  study also shows that academics may turn to  blogging in order to bypass traditional jour- nalism  in  broadcasting  research  findings  to  a  broader  public,  while  journalists  consider  blogs by researchers as useful and trustwor- thy sources  Colson, 2011 . Of course, blog- ging, as with many other online activities, is  not only hard to categorize, it is also evolv- ing  over  time   Karpf,  2012 . Walker   2006   reports  how  her  personal  blogging  practice    598  changed  –  from  her  first  experience  as  a  blogging grad student to being a tenured fac- ulty member – and how blogging in general  became more popular.  In some cases, blogs may be used to pub- lish novel research results. Compared to jour- nal  articles   where  the  publication  process  may  take  years ,  blogs  have  the  advantage  of  a  much  faster  publication  process  –   in  fact,  they  are  often  instantly  available.  There are still more indications that blogging  is  not  used  for  the  same  purposes  as  tradi- tional publications. Buschman and Michalek   2013  explain that researchers use blogs to  share  background  information  about  their  work,  which  may  also  include  approaches  that led to negative results. Negative research  results  are  important  for  the  advancement  of  science,  but  have  recently  been  less  fre- quently published in traditional publications   Fanelli, 2012 . Although new journals have  been  founded  which  particularly  focus  on  negative  results   e.g.,  Journal  of  Negative  Results  in  Biomedicine,  http:  jnrbm.com ,  they are not universally available for all dis- ciplines.  It  is  therefore  positive  when  blogs  help to fill the gap and provide information  of this kind. Blogging is also used in addition  to  traditional  papers,  for  example,  to  attract  more  attention  to  them.  Several  researchers  reported on positive effects of having blogged  about  their  research.  Terras   2012   experi- enced an increased download rate of papers  discussed  in  her  blog  in  comparison  with  papers that were only published traditionally.  Hoang et al.  2015  found that blog articles  receive up to 14 times more page views than  journal articles on the same topic. Therefore,  they  conclude  that  ‘dissemination  of  scien- tific  material  on  a  radiology  blog  promoted  on  social  media  can  substantially  augment  the reach of more traditional publication ven- ues [and] … researchers in radiology should  not  ignore  opportunities  for  increasing  the  impact of research findings via social media’   Hoang et al., 2015: 760 .  It  remains  an  ongoing  question  to  what  extent  references  in  Wikipedia  might  also   help to increase the impact and visibility of  research publications. Similar to blogs, wikis  in general and Wikipedia in particular can be  considered as early examples of social media.  Wikipedia as a collaboratively created online  encyclopedia reflects a form of public under- standing of science. It has thus found its very  own place within the ecosystem of scholarly  communication:  Wikipedia  articles  quote  scholarly  work  and  therefore  become  part  of  the  scholarly  communication  life-cycle.  On  the  other  hand,  many  academics  would  not  consider  Wikipedia  as  a  reliable  source  that  can be  quoted.  Nielsen   2007   uses the  number  of  Wikipedia  references  to  peer- reviewed articles as a proof for the quality of  Wikipedia content. Luyt and Tan  2010  have  analyzed the credibility of Wikipedia articles  and found numerous statements of Wikipedia  articles  on  history  topics  lacking  any  form  of  valid  reference.  They  still  conclude  that  Wikipedia is valuable, as it offers a gateway  to  academic  knowledge  that  is  otherwise  often  hidden  behind  paywalls  that  prevent  access to scholarly publications for a general  public  and  even  for  many  researchers.  It  is,  however,  unclear  whether  Wikipedia  arti- cles  really  help  to  transfer  knowledge  from  behind  academic  publishers’  paywalls  to  a  broader community. For example, Teplitskyi,  Lu and Duede  2015  arrive at the conclusion  that there is an effect of open access literature  being overrepresented on Wikipedia.  neTWorking and conTenT- sharing plaTforms for   general audiences ThaT   are used by academics  Blogs  and  Wikipedia  focus  primarily  on  longer  texts  as  their  dominant  form  of  con- tent.  User  profile  pages  and  connections  between users are of minor relevance. During  the evolution of the social media landscape,  networking elements have gained importance  and  by  now  there  is  a  vibrant  landscape  of    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   599  various social networking platforms that are  utilized  by  researchers  in  specific  ways.  Facebook  can  be  considered  the  biggest  social  networking  platform  worldwide   Statista,  2016 ,  although  in  some  countries  different social networks have grown popular  instead,  such  as  Vkontakte  in  Russia  or  renren,  Weibo  or  WeChat  in  China.  Other  social networking platforms, such as Google+   Henderson, 2012 , may include similar fea- tures  as  Facebook,  but  are  less  popular  in  general. LinkedIn is popular among academ- ics  in  different  countries,  but  has  a  slightly  different  set  of  features  as  it  is  mainly  tar- geted  as  professional  usage.  Given  that  in  June  2016  Microsoft  announced  that  it  had  acquired LinkedIn, it remains to be seen how  usage  numbers  and  functionalities  will  develop or merge with existing services.  The  high  number  of  users  is  Facebook’s  biggest  advantage  –  as  with  typical  net- work goods, the number of users determines  its  value  for  the  individual  user   Katz  &  Shapiro,  1985 . Thus,  Facebook  establishes  a common ground for connecting with others  with  little  effort.  Facebook  is  highly  popu- lar  with  researchers  of  different  disciplines   Van  Noorden,  2014 ,  but  little  is  known  about whether researchers are more likely to  have a Facebook account than other groups,  whether they connect with more people via  Facebook,  or  have  more  international  con- nections.  The  facts  that  researchers  tend  to  travel  a  lot,  often  work  in  international  environments, or even move on to different  places  of  residence  over  the  years,  suggest  that they could particularly benefit from plat- forms  that  support  connections  internation- ally. It has, however, been shown that use of  Facebook often takes place in private settings   Pscheida et al., 2014; Van Noorden, 2014 ,  reflecting that researchers perceive the audi- ences and affordances  Norman, 1988  they  find  on  the  platform  in  a  specific,  yet  too  narrow, way, preventing them from using it  professionally.  In  fact,  Facebook  offers  several  useful  features for academics  Nentwich & König,   2014 :  it  allows  group  communication  and  one-to-one  communication  and  supports  synchronous  as  well  as  asynchronous  com- munication channels. Facebook enables dif- ferent profile pages for academic institutions   universities, scholarly associations, etc.  and  for individuals, offering different functional- ities for interaction with followers  of pages   and friends  of users . Posts on Facebook are  of flexible length and can contain multime- dia features. Another asset is the diversity of  user groups with whom researchers can get  in  touch  and  with  whom  they  can  commu- nicate their work. On the other hand, all this  comes at a cost: Facebook is frequently criti- cized for intransparent privacy settings  e.g.,  Liu  et  al.,  2011 .  Furthermore,  Facebook’s  features  and  options  for  individual  settings  are constantly changing, which may require  that users constantly spend time and effort on  keeping up to date. Another potential draw- back can be the fact that students also largely  use  Facebook,  which  may  challenge  tradi- tional  authoritative  structures.  Goodband  et al.  2012  report a case of a student group  that  got  in  conflict  with  the  broader  math- ematics community.  Another platform that combines social net- working features with personal status updates  is  Twitter.  Several  guidelines  for  scholarly  uses  of  social  media  have  portrayed  micro- blogging  with  Twitter  as  useful  for  diverse  academic  purposes  and  contexts   Herwig  et  al.,  2009;  Mollett,  Moran  &  Dunleavy,  2011 .  There  are  also  several  studies  that  investigate  the  use  of  Twitter  in  scholarly  communication   an  overview  can  be  found  in  Mahrt,  Weller  &  Peters,  2014 ,  though  often  focusing  on  specific  case  studies.  However, surveys with researchers have indi- cated  a  rather  low  uptake  of Twitter  among  academics   e.g.,  Gu  &  Widén-Wulff,  2011;  Harley  et  al.,  2010;  Ponte  &  Simon;  2011 ,  while  there  appear  to  be  some  disciplinary  differences.  Twitter’s strength is in specific usage sce- narios, such as in being used during academic  conferences  as  a  tool  for  live  reporting  and    600  interconnecting   e.g.,  Letierce  et  al.,  2010;  Ross et al., 2011; Weller, Dröge & Puschman,  2011 . In this specific context and connected  to  a  conference-specific  hashtag,  Twitter  facilitates exchange not only among existing  networks of scholars, but also around shared  interests. It enables new contacts in an infor- mal  and  low-threshold  manner. This  is  sup- ported by the fact that Twitter does not require  relationships between users to be reciprocal.  Another typical use of Twitter is the sharing  of  URLs  that  point  to  interesting Web  con- tent  or  scholarly  publications   Eysenbach,  2011; Priem & Costello, 2010 . It thus plays  a major role in the study of alternative met- rics  for  measuring  scholarly  impact,  as  we  will see below.  Other platforms that target a general audi- ence but are also used by academics for pro- fessional  purposes  include,  among  others,  SlideShare, YouTube or GitHub. These three  platforms  are  mainly  selected  to  illustrate  the  broader  spectrum  of  academic  content  that is being shared online, including videos,  slideshows and programming code. They are,  however, not the only examples of tools used  for these purposes. On SlideShare research- ers  may  share  presentation  slides  used  dur- ing conference talks. In principle, it can also  be  an  outlet  for  teaching  material,  although  a survey by Herath and Hewagamage  2015   indicates that SlideShare is only rarely used  for  teaching  purposes.  In  general,  rather  little  is  known  about  the  academic  use  of  SlideShare or other platforms that enable the  sharing  of  presentation  slides.  Some  more  insights are available on the scholarly use of  YouTube,  which  also  features  videos  taken  at academic conferences and online lectures.  Furthermore,  YouTube  videos  are  being  cited  both  in  traditional  scholarly  publica- tions  Kousha, Thelwall & Abdoli, 2012  and  in  academic  tweets   Thelwall  et  al.,  2012 .  GitHub  can  be  described  as  an  open  soft- ware repository, where users may share their  scripts and code with an interested audience.  As such, it is being studied as an example of  social coding  Dabbish et al., 2012; Marlow,   Dabbish & Herbsleb, 2013 , where one may  get  insights  not  only  into  sharing  behavior,  but  also  into  collaboration  in  creating  new  code.  Researchers can also be found communi- cating in various online forums. Another case  of particular interest is reddit. This platform  includes  several  sections   subreddits   that  are  dedicated  to  current  scientific  findings  and  recent  scholarly  publications  as  well  as  academic life and career choices  e.g., www. reddit.com r academia or www.reddit.com r  Professors  .  There  are  even  subreddits  that  call out cases of misinterpretations of scien- tific findings  e.g., www.reddit.com r badsc- ience . With all this, reddit combines features  of  blogs  and  bookmarking  systems  with  a  broader networked community and thus has a  significant potential for advancing scholarly  communication.  However,  not  much  insight  is  available  on  the  actual  role  reddit  is  cur- rently playing in academia.  specific social media plaTforms  for academic audiences  In addition to the popular general platforms,  some social media platforms are specifically  addressing academics as their target audience.  Few  of  them  even  focus  on  specific  disci- plines,  for  example,  http:  hypotheses.org,   a blog aggregator for the humanities and the  social  sciences.  But  more  popular  are  those  that  address  the  academic  community  as  a  whole,  like  Academia.edu,  Mendeley  and  ResearchGate.  All of the latter include some principles of  social bookmarking. The idea of social book- marking  platforms   Henning  &  Reichelt,  2008  is relatively simple yet powerful: they  enable  their  users  to  create  bookmarks  for  web  contents  which  they  want  to  retrieve  later.  Often  they  include  functionalities  of  social  tagging  so  that  users  assign  content- descriptive  keywords   ‘tags’   to  their  book- marks  for  adding  structure  and  enhancing    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   601  retrieval options  Peters, 2009 . Social book- marking platforms started as tools for gener- ally saving all sorts of links on the Web, for  example,  through  platforms  like  CiteULike  or Delicious. They were soon also taken up  by users who wanted to share and keep track  of scholarly literature on the Web, which lead  to specialized bookmarking systems for this  type  of  resources  and  turned  platforms  into  social  reference  managers.  Platforms  like  Bibsonomy   Zoller  et  al.,  2016   or  Zotero  include functionalities such as, for example,  directly importing bibliographic metadata via  identifiers  e.g., DOI or ISBN numbers .  Moreover,  Academia.edu,  ResearchGate  and  Mendeley  have  used  functionalities  of  social  networking  platforms  and  com- bined  them  with  bookmarking  principles  in  order  to  attract  an  academic  user  com- munity. Users can set up profile pages with  information  on  their  affiliations  and  other  biographical  details  as  well  as  research  interests  and  expertise.  They  may  then  also  connect with other researchers  e.g., also by  browsing for topics or affiliations , and fol- low their updates. In this way, one may, for  example,  be  informed  about  new  publica- tions  from  specific  researchers.  Publication  lists  are  becoming  part  of  the  user  profiles  too. And usually, researchers are enabled to  also upload manuscripts directly. This leads  to  another  core  feature  of  these  platforms:  they may count in-platform citations of pub- lications as well as numbers of article views,  downloads  and  of  course  bookmarks.  They  also  use  these  counts  to  promote  platform  services  through  addressing  the  academics’  vanity fair, that is the tendency of academics  to  constantly  compare  themselves  and  their  works against those of their peers - which is  increasingly criticized  Murray, 2014 .  the   There  are  more  critical  voices,  especially  concerning  increasingly  commercial  nature  of  these  platforms.  Academia.edu  is  criticized for using the .edu domain without  being  an  educational  institution.  And  since  Mendeley  was  bought  by  Elsevier  in  2013,  this has also raised many concerns for future   developments and led to calls for boycotting  the reference management system  although  almost no effect can be seen in the user num- bers3 .  Others  criticize  these  platforms  for  their  lack  of  transparency  and  for  locking  in  user  data.  For  example,  ResearchGate’s  underlying  metrics  are  intransparent  and  influenced  by  spam   Kraker  &  Lex,  2015 .  Single  approaches  exist  for  making  the  underlying  user  data  transparent  and  open.  Mendeley, for example, offers an open appli- cation  programming  interface   API   that  allows users to download their contribution,  whereas  ResearchGate  and  Academia.edu  do  not  offer  this  option.  To  overcome  this  problematic  situation,  William  Gunn  from  Mendeley, in a comment to Matthews  2016 ,  advises us to ‘embrace the idea of a [sic.] eco- system  of  applications,  each  interoperating  with the other to provide a flexible range of  functions that fit the diverse needs of various  scholarly  fields  rather  than  one  monolithic  site  which  aims  to  be  all  for  everyone’.  It  should be noted, however, that similar prac- tices and methods to ensure exclusivity have  been known in scholarly communication for  years – most prominently those fought about  in the ‘Elsevier boycott’4 – and they are not  immanent challenges of social media use.  Despite  some  limitations  in  accessibil- ity,  the  overall  existence  of  different  usage  statistics  also  makes  these  platforms  inter- esting in the exploration of novel metrics to  measure  scholarly  impact  –  as  we  will  also  discuss below. Indeed, from research in this  field we learn that these academic bookmark- ing networking  platforms  have  achieved  notable  coverage  of  scholarly  literature.  In  selected  samples  from  different  scholarly  domains, Mendeley includes more than 80%   and up to 97%  of published research papers   Haustein  et  al.,  2013:  Haustein,  Larivière  et  al.,  2014;  Li, Thelwall  &  Giustini,  2012;  Priem  et  al.,  2012 .  Although  coverage  of  publications  appears  broad  on  social  media  platforms,  there  may  be  specific  omissions  and  biases   especially  regarding  the  disci- plines  and  types  of  articles  covered .  Given    602  that articles shared on social networking plat- forms  like  ResearchGate  are  subject  to  the  platforms’ terms and services, those publish- ing approaches can also not be compared to  institutional repositories and true open access  initiatives  for  several  reasons,  such  as  that  they do not support long-term availability of  the data or allow for text mining.  Also,  some  researchers  explicitly  avoid  using  these  platforms  for  these  reasons  or  consider profiles only as a ‘me too-presence’   Nentwich  &  König,  2014:  113   to  signal  readiness to network. This leads to the next  question  on  the  validity  of  usage  data.  Do  registered  researchers  actively  use  the  plat- forms at all? Little is still known about who  is  active.  In  terms  of  number  of  profiles,  ‘ResearchGate  is  more  than  twice  as  popu- lar as Academia.edu. Usage of ResearchGate  particularly outweighs that of Academia.edu  in China and Japan, in the sciences and among  the most senior researchers. Overall, 61 per  cent  of  respondents  who  have  published  at  least one paper use ResearchGate, while 28  per cent use Academia.edu, and just 0.2 per  cent  apparently  use  Mendeley’   Matthews,  2016 .  Studies  like  these  are  just  the  first  step towards understanding how social media  influence the perceived impact and relevance  of  a  researcher  or  their  individual  digital  identity. Much more work is needed to fully  assess  the  impact  of  social  media  on  schol- arly communication and researchers’ careers.  challenges and draWbacks of  using social media in academia  We  have  now  seen  that  social  media  plat- forms  offer  a  variety  of  opportunities  for  researchers to connect and engage and that,  overall,  their  functionalities  well  meet  the  goals of scholarly communication. However,  to complete the picture of scholarly commu- nication  with  social  media  we  must  also  consider  the  drawbacks  and  challenges  that  every  tool  entails.  First,  the  appearance  of   social media platforms in academic environ- ments may lead to new tasks and efforts that  may  challenge  researchers  personally.  The  increased  availability  and  amount  of  prod- ucts of scholarly communication can lead to  an information overload that leaves the con- sumers of research results with all the effort  of  searching  and  compiling  information.  Moreover,  since  in  social  media  environ- ments  traditional  indicators  and  institutions  commonly  guaranteeing  a  certain  quality  standard  of  the  research  product  may  not  work any more, the entire process of quality  assurance   e.g.,  peer  review   and  relevance  assessment  is  loaded  on  to  the  consumer  side.  Here,  education  and  tools  need  to  be  developed  to  assist  researchers  and  other  stakeholders in wading through the flood of  information.  On  the  other  side,  it  might  be  problematic  and  for  researchers to engage in social media-based  scholarly  communication  in  order  to  main- tain their profiles on social networking sites  and keep every representation of their digital  image  up  to  date.  Some  researchers  may  decide just to focus on single platforms and  will  not  register  on  other  platforms.  On  the  other  hand,  this  means  that  one  single  plat- form  will  rarely  be  able  to  provide  a  com- plete picture of researchers in one field.  time-consuming   Second,  there  are  other  reasons  why  researchers  may  decide  to  not  use  specific  platforms.  It  should  not  be  underestimated  that most of the social media platforms used  for  scholarly  communication  are,  although  free for use, private companies still searching  for business models and revenue. This means  that content put on their platforms is subject to  the company’s terms and services – sometimes  allowing  the  company  forms  of  manipula- tion,  re-use,  and  ownership.  Moreover,  since the platform providers usually control  appearance, functionalities and algorithms of  their services, they also massively influence  how  as well as if and what  scholarly content  is presented and consumed. Matthews  2016   reports  that  researchers  fear  ‘tunnel  vision’  if  only  popular  and  mainstream  articles  are    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   603  displayed and only a narrow view of the land- scape  of  scholarly  publications  is  provided.  Although  social  media-based  platforms  are  able  to  increase  accessibility  to  scientific  content,  openness  is  interpreted  differently  by the providers.  Finally,   social  media  use  may  be  approached differently by different research- ers. Some may be more successful in draw- ing  attention  to  their  own  activities.  This  can lead to a ‘rich gets richer’ phenomenon,  where those who already have succeeded in  gaining attention for their social media pro- files will continue to do so, while others will  struggle  to  ever  reach  a  similar  level. Also,  researchers with a higher academic age and  or  longer  lists  of  publications  may  have  an  advantage over beginners, since it is easier to  find them or their contributions on the social  media  platforms.  This  has  been  confirmed  by  earlier  research:  senior  scholars  appear  to attract more page views on Academia.edu    Thelwall  &  Kousha,  2014 ,  and  have  a  higher perceived impact  Li & Gillet, 2013 .  As mentioned before, this effect is amplified  by the algorithms underlying the social media  platforms  that  often  provide  more  visibility  for  researchers  and  contributions  that  have  already gained a lot of attention in the past.  Considering this, it is most crucial that we  improve our understanding of attention eco- nomics in scholarly social media use. A first  step towards this can be achieved by critically  investigating  social  media  usage  related  to  academia. Currently, such efforts can mainly  be  found  as  parts  of  a  broader  community  that  aims  at  developing  novel  indicators  for  measuring scholarly communication through  novel data  not only  from social media.  assessing scholarly  communicaTion WiTh   social media meTrics  We  have  seen  how  different  social  media  platforms can be used in academia and that   social media complement platforms of schol- arly communication since they offer authors  even  more  possibilities  to  present  them- selves, publish content, exchange arguments  and to set up an online academic identity. As  such,  they  enable  researchers  to  leave  new  types  of  footprints  that  can  be  exploited  in  scholarly communication, for example, user  profiles,  posts,  tweets.  The  next  question  is  whether there are ways to measure how the  platforms  are  actually  affecting  scholarly  communication.  Defining  what  counts  as  acts of scholarly communication in platforms  such as Twitter, Facebook or Wikipedia is not  always trivial. In social media environments  scholarly conversation and exchange of argu- ments evolve around profiles, footprints, and  shadows  of  all  contributors  to  the  research  life-cycle. In the following, we will consider  scholarly communication in social media as  reflected  through  three  dimensions:   1   the  dimension  of  actively  leaving  footprints  in  social media;  2  the dimension of passively  casting shadows which are reflected through  the activities of others; and  3  the dimension  of creating a digital identity that is composed  of the previous two dimensions.  Footprints, Shadows and   Digital identities  Every  researcher  leaves  their  footprints  through  numerous  activities.  In  traditional  scholarly communication, the act of leaving  footprints  is  relatively  clear  to  define  –  and  typically  happens  very  consciously:  a  researcher  actively  publishes  a  paper  or   a book, gives a talk at a conference, provides  a list of references with a publication, edits a  collection,  etc. All  these  acts  can  be  traced  back to the researcher and thus shape his or  her  identity  as  an  actor  in  the  respective  scholarly  community.  A  more  complicated  case  is  participation  in  blind  review  pro- cesses,  where  actions  of  one  researcher  –  writing  a  review  –  leave  footprints,  but  cannot normally be traced back to the person    604  directly. However, reviewing also shapes the  presented identity of a researcher if member- ship on reviewer boards or program commit- tees  is  included  in  the  CV.  All  of  these  footprints can be counted – and most of them  are  increasingly  being  counted  in  order  to  measure  scholarly  activity   e.g.,  to  justify  spending of tax money for research, etc. .  Researchers  also  cast  their  shadows,  an  act that is more passive because it cannot be  influenced  –  shadows  emerge  where  others  react  to  one’s  own  activities.  In  traditional  scholarly  publication,  this  usually  happens  through  citations.  If  my  own  work  is  being  cited  in  another  scholar’s  paper,  a  shadow  of my work has been created. There are thus  two sides on how to view a single researcher  within  the  system  of  scholarly  communica- tion: based on the profile he she has created  himself herself  or  based  on  how  others  see  her him reflected through citations and other  types  of  shadows   which  can,  for  example,  be book reviews or mass media articles refer- ring to scholarly work . Again, most of this  can be and is being counted. In terms of cita- tions, counting is to some degree automated  on platforms like Google Scholar, Scopus or  Web  of  Science;  in  other  cases,  researchers  may have an interest to count themselves how  often they are mentioned in reviews or mass  media.  This  is  because  the  respective  num- bers are also increasingly being viewed as a  part of an academic identity; they are believed  to  illustrate  how  influential  a  researcher  is.  Of  course,  focusing  on  aggregated  counts  as  indicators  of  activity  and  influence,  and  therefore  as  true  reflections  of  an  academic  identity, can be criticized, especially if num- bers  are  viewed  out  of  context   e.g.,  disci- plinary  context    see  the  Leiden  Manifesto:  Hicks et al., 2015 .  In the digital world, new types of footprints  and shadows emerge, not all of them happen- ing equally consciously and not all of them in  a  countable  format   yet .  A  researcher  who  actively  publishes  a  blog  post,  posts  a  com- ment on Facebook, or publishes a tweet is leav- ing a footprint. A researcher who downloads   the pdf file of an article, likes a Facebook post,  retweets a tweet, or links to a blog post is also  leaving  footprints  in  social  media.  Shadows  of  researchers’  activities  can  consequently  appear in the form of received likes, retweets,  pingbacks, or mentions on Wikipedia, as well  as  in  download  statistics,  Mendeley  reader- ship and other forms of reactions to traditional  publications  that  are  represented  in  social  media platforms. Again, footprints and shad- ows contribute to the perceived identity of a  scholar.  The  digital  identity  of  a  researcher  with all the facets is based on footprints and  shadows that are visible online – and only on  those that are visible online, that is presenta- tions or publications and activities that are not  tracked and publicly published online do not  shape the digital identity of a researcher.  All  this  leads  to  new  important  questions:  As  researchers’  identities  do  no  longer  build  on footprints and shadows of purely traditional  forms of scholarly communication, do we need  new ways to measure and quantify digital forms  of footprints and shadows? And to which degree  are  both  dimensions,  digital  and  traditional,  similar or different in what they represent?  Metrics  to  quantify  scholarly  communi- cation  have  long  been  subject  to  critiques.  Researchers  concerned  with  scholarly  met- rics  have  acknowledged  several  drawbacks  and limitations, among others, that citations  need  time  to  accumulate,  that  they  do  not  reflect the motivation of the citation, that they  only reflect impact on other authors instead  of  all  readers  of  the  publication,  and  that  citation  behavior  varies  between  disciplines   MacRoberts & MacRoberts, 1989; see also  Haustein  &  Larivière,  2014 .  Consequently,  with  scholarly  communication  reaching  the  Internet, approaches for also measuring these  activities  were  explored.  Early  approaches  have  been  labeled  ‘webometrics’   Thelwall,  2008  in reference to the earlier terms ‘bib- liometrics’ and ‘scientometrics’. Webometric  approaches for calculating metrics are mainly  based on Web links or download numbers.  In  2010,  the  term  ‘altmetrics’  was  intro- duced when Jason Priem, Dario Taraborelli,    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   605  Paul  Groth  and  Cameron  Neylon   2010   published their Altmetrics Manifesto  Priem  et al., 2010 , after Priem first suggested the  name  altmetrics  in  a  tweet.  The  authors  of  the manifesto report different motivations for  their call for new metrics: they describe alt- metrics as a possible tool to guide researchers  through the huge amount of potentially rele- vant information on the Web  acknowledging  that ‘no one can read everything’, Priem et al.  [2010], highlight the role of social media as  pointers  to  interesting  literature ,  and  envi- sion that evaluation of researchers may in the  future also consider output and influence in  social  media  environments.  Altmetrics  are  still  not  or  only  very  rarely  used  officially  in  evaluation  processes  such  as  funding  or  hiring  decisions,  but  some  in  the  altmet- rics  community  have  been  advocating  for  this  idea   Galligan  &  Dyas-Correia  2013;  Lapinski, Piwowar & Priem, 2013; Piwowar,  2013b .5  Not  all  researchers,  believe  that  social  media  activities  will  be  considered  in  evaluative  contexts  in  the  future   Procter  et  al.,  2010a ,  and  there  is  no  knowledge  about  how  many  would  want  social  media  to be included in evaluation processes. Even  more crucial may be the fact that it is hardly  known what types of activities and influence  of  scholarly  communication  would  actually  be measured through data from social media  and altmetrics based upon them – a problem  that is also inspiring different broader initia- tives to better understand altmetrics. One of  the  most  notable  developments  in  this  field  is the NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics   Altmetrics   Initiative6  by  the  National  Information Standards Organization  NISO .  WhaT do social media meTrics  measure – and hoW?  Since  the  publication  of  the  Altmetrics  Manifesto   Priem  et  al.,  2010 ,  and  even  before  this,  quite  a  significant  number  of  studies have focused on measuring different   scholarly  footprints  and  shadows  through  social  media  data  with  the  aim  to  better  understand  why  and  how  researchers  make  use  of  different  social  media  platforms.  Overall,  it  is  assumed  that  altmetrics  will  measure  different  phenomena  than  tradi- tional  metrics  for  scholarly  communication.  Social  media  are  expected  to  respond  to  scholarly  publications  much  quicker  than  traditional citations, which means that ‘many  online  tools  and  environments  surface  evi- dence  of  impact  relatively  early  in  the  research  cycle,  exposing  essential  but  tradi- tionally  invisible  precursors  like  reading,  bookmarking, saving, annotating, discussing,  and recommending articles’  Haustein et al.,  2013: 2 . Consequently, social media metrics  can be obtained quicker than traditional cita- tions;  they  are  ‘available  immediately  after  publication – and even before publication in  the case of preprints – and offer a more rapid  assessment of impact’  Thelwall et al., 2013 .  Piwowar  2013a: 9  sees four advantages of  altmetrics social media metrics in that they:   1   provide  ‘a  more  nuanced  understanding  of  impact’,   2   provide  ‘more  timely  data’,   3   include  the  consideration  of  alternative  and ‘web-native scholarly products like data- sets, software, blog posts, videos and more’,  and   4   serve  as  ‘indications  of  impacts  on  diverse  audiences’.  While  Piwowar   2013a   speaks of nuances for measuring impact, this  also  poses  additional  challenges,  as  long  as  little  is  known  about  the  different  nuances  and  their  meanings.  Similarly,  Lapinski  Piwowar and Priem  2013: 292–293  discuss  different  ‘impact  flavors’  as  ‘a  product  fea- tured  in  mainstream  media  stories,  blogged  about,  and  downloaded  by  the  public,  for  instance, has a very different flavor of impact  than  one  heavily  saved  and  discussed  by  scholars’   Lapinski  et  al.,  2013:  292–293 .  But what is the ‘flavor’ of a retweet, a blog  post, or a Wikipedia reference? What are the  motivations  behind  these  different  social  media  activities?  To  what  degree  do  they  represent  a  commitment  comparable  to  a  citation  in  a  published  article? A  lot  of  the    606  current  research  in  altmetrics  attempts  to  assess  the  quality  and  scope  of  altmetrics  indicators, with case studies comparing met- rics  across  platforms   either  alternative  or  traditional  or across specific disciplines.  Answering questions on how social media  metrics relate to traditional forms of scholarly  communication, altmetrics research faces the  same challenges as all social media studies:  with these media evolving quickly and users  changing their practices at the same time, one  is  studying  a  moving  target   Karpf,  2012 .  Altmetrics  studies  also  face  similar  techni- cal  challenges  as  social  media  research  in  general: data have to be obtained from social  media platforms, for example, via the appli- cation  programming  interface   API ,  which  is  often  restricted  by  the  companies  behind  the platforms  Gaffney & Puschmann, 2014 .  Also,  many  third-party  tools  that  allow  for  data  collection  from  social  media  act  as  black  boxes:  it  is  hard  to  understand  how  data have been collected and prepared and to  assess whether a tool is reliable and the data  are  complete  or  representative   Haustein,  Peters  et  al.,  2014 .  Stakeholders  involved  in altmetrics  Weller, 2015  have assembled  some specialized tools, sometimes based on  the  involvement  of  big  publishers  such  as  Elsevier   who  bought  Mendeley  in  2013 .  Liu and Adie  2013b: 153  have summed up  the current state of the art as follows: ‘All of  the tools are in their early stages of growth.  Altmetrics  measures  are  not  standardized  and  have  not  been  systematically  validated;  there has been no clear consensus on which  data sources are most important to measure;  and  technical  limitations  currently  prevent   the  tracking  of  certain  sources,  such  as   multimedia files’.  So,  currently,  different  approaches  to  measure scholarly communication are being  explored, different indicators are being com- bined and different tools are being developed.  At  the  same  time,  research  in  altmetrics  is  conducted to better understand the relations  between user behavior, tools and new indica- tors. Before we take a look at some examples   of this kind of research, it may be useful to  take a step back and – on a meta-perspective –   distinguish different levels of assessing user  activities  in  social  media  through  altmet- rics.  In  particular,  we  can  distinguish  the   following approaches  modified from Weller,  2015 :   	 Article-level metrics. This summarizes approaches  to  measure  the  impact  of  traditional  scholarly  articles through the shadows they cast in social  media  platforms,  especially  by  aggregating  all  types of citation for a specific publication  such  as,  for  example,  traditional  citations  plus  men- tions on Twitter .   	 Metrics based on alternative forms of interac- tions.  Some  shadows  resemble  traditional  cita- tions  less,  but  reflect  other  forms  of  engaging  with a publication  e.g., readership statistics, likes  or bookmarks . Again, these can be aggregated  with other metrics on the article-level.   	 Metrics for new output formats.  A  next  step  is  not  only  to  measure  the  impact  of  tradi- tional  publications,  but  to  consider  all  kinds  of  footprints,  including  a  researcher’s  output  in  social  media  platforms,  such  as  blog  posts  or  academic YouTube  videos,  or  software  commits    e.g., Github and Depsy [see http:  depsy.org] .   	 Aggregated metrics for researchers.  If  all  kinds  of footprints and shadows are combined for one  researcher,  the  aggregated  metrics  can  also  be  used to inform us about their digital identity.  For the key question of whether social media  mentions predict subsequent traditional cita- tion rates  or whether they at least correlate  to some degree with traditional citation met- rics , the most comprehensive study has been  conducted  by  Thelwall  et  al.   2013 ,  who  looked  at  eleven  different  social  media  resources.  They  concluded  that  the  metrics  collected  from  different  sources  were  not  able to predict subsequent citations. We thus  have  to  assume  that  social  media  metrics  represent  different  phenomena  of  scholarly  communication  than  traditional  metrics,  although  in  this  mostly  case-based  area  of  research,  slightly  varying  values  may  be  found for some platforms or for specific dis- ciplines. For example, for Mendeley, several    sCholarly CoMMuniCation in soCial Media   607  studies found a moderate to significant cor- relation  of  readership  and  counts  of  tradi- tional citation  Haustein et al., 2013; Li et al.,  2012; Priem et al., 2012; Zahedi et al., 2014 . In  another  example,  Zahedi  et  al.   2014   compared article-level altmetrics aggregated  for  journals  across  disciplines  and  showed  how  journals  from  different  disciplines  are  represented  to  a  very  different  extent  on  Mendeley, Wikipedia, Twitter, and Delicious.  Holmberg  and  Thelwall   2014   compare  Twitter  usage  across  10  different  scholarly  disciplines. And, as mentioned above, social  media  have  to  be  considered  as  a  moving  target  –  the  field  of  social  media  metrics  is  still  developing,  as  Haustein,  Peters  et  al.   2014   demonstrated:  in  2012  around  20%  of  biomedical  papers  were  mentioned  in  at  least one tweet on Twitter, twice as many as  in 2011.  On the other hand, research indicates that  social  media  activities  do  have  a  potential  to  really  influence  scholarly  communica- tion. For example, tweeting about a scholarly  paper increases its download statistics  Shuai,  Pepe  &  Bollen,  2012   –  which  could  mean  that social media are rather linked to reader- ship than to citations and that researchers do  indeed  use  their  peers’  social  media  activi- ties as recommendations for useful literature.  One  needs  to  be  careful  with  very  popular  content  on  social  media,  though.  Haustein,  Peters  et  al.   2014   show  that  papers  with  unusually funny titles are much more popular  on Twitter  e.g., ‘Penile fracture seems more  likely during sex under stressful situations’ . This  case  is  a  reminder  that  altmetics  research  has  not  yet  fully  revealed  what  social media metrics are measuring exactly –   scholarly  impact  or  other  forms  of  interest- ingness, popularity, or buzz. Another crucial  step  in  order  to  shed  light  on  this  situation  will be to get a more complete picture of who  is  using  different  social  media  platforms:  Who  is  using  Twitter,  Facebook,  YouTube,  Mendeley and co.? Are users of different aca- demic disciplines represented equally across  platforms? What  are  the  user  demographics   and how do they develop? How well are we  able to capture data from different platforms  with the tools we have? How can we compare  conceptually  different  units  of  user  interac- tion, for example, retweets versus likes?  conclusion  In the last decade, new formats and means of  publishing,  communication  and  exchange  have  evolved. These  tools  and  publications,  driven  by  developments  in  the  social  media  market in particular, have brought a plethora  of options that have fundamentally changed  the way researchers engage in scholarly dis- course and that have proposed, among others,  the  scholarly  communication:  following  benefits   for    	 They offer new venues for all elements of schol-   	 They  provide  more  timely  and  direct  conversa-  arly communication.  tions and feedback.   	 They enable faster and more efficient access and   exchange of scholarly information.   	 They increase availability of scholarly information.  	 They  increase  visibility  of  researchers  and  their   scientific contribution.   	 This  results  in  a  positive  feedback  loop  of  vis- ibility  and  reputation  of  research  products  and  researchers.   	 They enable quick feedback on the relevance of   scholarly products via altmetrics.  Social  media-based  scholarly  communica- tion  has  resulted  in  diverse  products  con- cerned  with  research  outcomes   e.g.,  blogs  or tweets  which in specific cases are much  better publication formats for research find- ings  e.g., videos of scientific experiments .  It has also enabled showcasing as well as the  acknowledgement  of  all  types  of  research  output   e.g.,  data  papers  on  GitHub .  Moreover,  this  development  has  offered  a  multitude of alternatives for reacting to those  publications   e.g.,  via  likes  or  retweets,  which  then  also  become  elements  of  the    608  scholarly discourse . Social media now offer  researchers  endless  possibilities  to  express  themselves and to develop scholarly identi- ties  that  are  truly  digital.  Research  showed  that scholars make conscious decisions when  choosing social media for scholarly commu- nication,  that  they  differentiate  between  tools  that  address  a  general  public   e.g.,  Facebook   or  peers   e.g.,  Academia.edu ,  and  that  they  are  well  aware  of  what  plat- forms serve which purposes and what foot- prints they leave.  Tracing  shadows  that  other  scholars  cre- ate  in  traditional,  web  and  social  media  environments  may  not  have  moved  into  the  center  of  most  researchers’  attention  so  far.  But it will gain importance given that forms  of reaction to scholarly content and engage- ment  with  publics  on  the  Social  Web  have  been  proposed  as  complementary  ways  of  measuring  impact  of  research   Priem  et  al.,  2010 . Besides traditional forms of publica- tion  and  scholarly  communication,  which  surely will keep their space in the ecosystem  of  publishing  and  referencing  because  of  their  long-earned  reputation,  social  media- based products have gained in popularity and  are seen as one of the driving forces behind  Science  2.0  and  Open  Science   European  Commission, 2016 . It is believed that access  to  research  results  and  other  outcomes  of  the research life-cycle, as provided by social  media  platforms  and  other  tools   preferably  in an as open as possible way , is of immense  benefit for science as a whole and will accel- erate  innovation  and  progress   European  Commission, 2016 .  Social media have put new players in the  field  of  scholarly  communication,  conse- quently  making  it  more  difficult  for  tradi- tional  providers  of  scholarly  content  to  get  their  shares  of  the  market,  but  also  making  the publication landscape more complicated  and  opaque  for  researchers  and  consumers  of  scholarly  content.  Given  the  success  of  social  media-based  communication  prac- tices and their still-increasing uptake among  researchers, the scholarly community as well   as society have to fundamentally rethink how  science is performed, presented and assessed.  In the end, the community has to decide on  which publishing modes are valued the most  and  should  persist,  and  which  processes  should be revised.
