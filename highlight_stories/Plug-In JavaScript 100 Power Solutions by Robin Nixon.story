Acknowledgments I would like to thank Wendy Rinaldi for giving me the opportunity of putting together   another book of handy plug-ins. I also want to thank Joya, Alan, Melinda, Tania, and  everyone else who has helped create this book, without whom it would not be the same.   McGraw-Hill is an exceptionally professional and friendly company to work with, and it  has once again been a pleasure.  xxiii   This page intentionally left blank    Introduction JavaScript is the free language built into all modern browsers including Internet Explorer,   Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Chrome. It is the power behind dynamic HTML and the Ajax  environment used for Web 2.0 websites such as Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, and many others. Plug-in JavaScript is aimed squarely at people who have learned basic HTML  and   perhaps a little CSS and JavaScript  and are interested in doing more. For example, you may  wish to create more dynamic menu systems, provide mouse hover effects, or support Ajax  functionality. In this book you will be shown how to do all these things and much more  using very simple JavaScript, and it is never assumed that you know anything about a  solution. Instead, you are taken through each example step by step with the explanations  included, so there is no need to look up anything elsewhere; every solution is complete and  applicable immediately.   Where possible, the book purposefully ignores more advanced JavaScript techniques   such as object oriented programming  even though they may sometimes be more powerful   to make it easy for you to understand all the plug-ins. Not using these advanced techniques  doesn’t mean the plug-ins are any less useful; rather, they may simply take a few extra lines  of code to achieve the same result, which will generally run just as fast as more compact  code.  The book can be dipped into as required because each chapter is self contained—when  you have a particular problem to solve, you can refer to the relevant chapter and it will be  all that you need.  About JavaScript  The JavaScript programming language is already over 15 years old and is more popular  than ever. Written by Brendan Eich at Netscape and previously known by the names Mocha  and LiveScript, JavaScript was first incorporated into the Netscape Navigator browser in  1995, the same time that Netscape added support for Sun’s Java technology.  JavaScript is a quite different language from Java but, as part of a marketing deal made  between Netscape and Sun Microsystems, it was given its name to benefit from the general  buzz surrounding the Java language. To justify this naming, all Java keywords are reserved  in JavaScript, its standard library follows Java’s naming conventions, and its Math and Date  objects are based on Java 1 classes. Also, the trademark name “JavaScript” now belongs to  Oracle Corporation—but the similarities end there.  xxv      xxvi   P l u g - i n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0   P o w e r   S o l u t i o n s  Microsoft’s version, called JScript, was released a year later as a component of Internet  Explorer 3 and, as you might expect, it differed in several important respects, making it less  than 100 percent compatible with JavaScript. Unfortunately, that remains true to this day, as  you will see in several of these plug-ins that work differently depending on which browser  they find themselves running in.  Unlike other languages used for creating websites, such as Perl, PHP, and Ruby,   JavaScript runs within the web browser, not on a web server. This makes it the perfect tool  for creating dynamic web pages because it can modify HTML elements in real time. It is  also the technology behind Web 2.0 Ajax functionality, in which data is transferred between  a web server and web browser behind the scenes, without the user being aware of it. As you will learn in Chapter 2, JavaScript’s great power lies in its ability to access   HTML’s Document Object Model  DOM , in which every element on a web page can be  individually addressed  either reading or modifying its value , and elements can also be  created and deleted on the fly, as well as layered over each other and moved about. You can  even go so far as to treat a web browser window as a blank canvas and build entire  applications and arcade games from scratch using JavaScript and the DOM  although doing  so takes some quite advanced programming skills .  Because Oracle owns the trademark to its name, JavaScript has officially been known as   ECMAScript ever since the language was submitted to ECMA, the European Computer  Manufacturers Association  a nonprofit standards organization .  JavaScript Frameworks Even with recent steps towards standardization, different browser developers still  implement JavaScript in slightly different ways, giving rise to the plethora of JavaScript  frameworks now available such as JQuery, YUI, Mootools, and so on. These technologies  handle all the inconsistencies for you, providing a set of functions you can call without  worrying about browser differences.  The plug-ins in this book provide much of the functionality of these frameworks   without actually constituting a framework. Procedural programming techniques make them  easy to use and also to understand their workings. And, although the plug-ins are often  interconnected and draw on each other’s features, it’s possible to copy just a single plug-in  and its dependencies to a web page. On the other hand, with the major frameworks it’s  quite difficult to extract just the functions you need.  Although at only around 25Kb for the compressed file containing all the plug-ins, the   additional tiny amount of bandwidth used means you probably will never want or need to  extract just a few functions: you can simply drop a link to the file in any web page to have  access to all the plug-ins.  What This Book Provides  This book provides 100 ready-to-go plug-ins you can draw on, usually with a simple, single  call. Of course, because all projects are different, I provide only the bare bones needed and  leave layout and styling to the absolute minimum. This leaves you free to insert the  functions into your own programs and then tailor them to your exact requirements.  The types of plug-ins supplied offer quick and simple solutions to a very wide range of   problems, allowing you to avoid having to reinvent the wheel each time you need a new       I n t r o d u c t i o n   xxvii  feature—because the chances are that the module you need  or one very similar  can be  found in this book as a plug-in. Even if it isn’t, because each and every one is broken down  into component parts and explained in detail, you can cherry-pick code segments from  different plug-ins to build your own.  About the Plug-ins  All this book’s plug-ins are ready to run and can be either typed in  if you don’t have  Internet access  or downloaded from pluginjavascript.com, where they are stored as a  complete collection in a single file.  When you visit the website, you can navigate through the plug-ins chapter by chapter   and view the JavaScript code highlighted in color for clarity. From there, you can copy,  paste, or download the plug-ins directly to your computer.  What Is and Isn’t Included Although the first aim of this book is to provide newcomers to JavaScript with a comprehensive  resource of functions and routines to draw on, it has a secondary goal, which is to help you  move up to the next level and to build your own programming toolkit. Therefore, all the  plug-ins are thoroughly documented and explained in detail, and advice is given on ways  to improve and extend them, as well as how to adapt them to your own requirements.  While this book isn’t a programming manual or a teaching guide, I do hope that by   reading through the explanations, rather than just including the plug-ins in your projects,  you’ll pick up a number of tips and tricks that many programmers take years to discover,  and by osmosis you will learn more about the JavaScript programming language.  Plug-in License You are free to use any of the plug-ins in this book in your own projects, and you may  modify them as necessary without attributing this book—although if you do give credit, it  will always be appreciated.  However, you may not sell, give away, or otherwise distribute the plug-ins themselves  in any manner, whether printed or in electronic format, without the written permission of  the publisher.  Companion Website  A companion website  pluginjavascript.com  accompanies this book, where all 100 plug-ins  are available to download, along with example code for you to experiment with.  The website is best used in conjunction with this book. As you read a chapter, call it up  on the website, and you can view each plug-in onscreen with color-highlighted syntax. This  makes it very easy to see the structure of each program.  Then, when you wish, you can click a link to copy and paste code right into your own  programs. Or, if you prefer, you can download all the plug-ins to your computer and from  there transfer them to your own website.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 1  Making the Best Use of these plug-ins      2   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Because JavaScript is supported by all major browsers, you might think that setting   yourself up as a JavaScript programmer is as easy as having a text editor and a web  browser. Well, you could get by with just those, but there’s actually a lot more to it if   you want to produce code efficiently, quickly, and with the minimum of bugs.  First of all, although JavaScript is available on almost all web browsers it varies slightly   between them in the way it implements certain features. This means that you need to be  able to test your code on all the main browsers to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.  So you really need to have access to a Windows computer, because recent versions of  Internet Explorer  IE  are available only for that operating system.  Downloading and Installing Web Browsers  Table 1-1 lists the five major web browsers and their Internet download locations. While all  of them can be installed on a Windows PC, some of them are not available for Mac OS X or  Linux. The web pages at these URLs are smart and offer up the correct version to download  according to your operating system, if available.  Before proceeding with this book I recommend that you ensure you have installed as   many of these browsers on your computer as you can.  If you’re running any version of Windows from XP onward, then you will be able to   install all of them, but on other operating systems it’s not quite so easy. For example,  because development of IE for the Mac was halted many years ago at IE version 5, you can  install all the browsers on Mac OS X except for Microsoft Internet Explorer. And, although  it’s possible to install the Wine windows application interface on a Mac and run Internet  Explorer using it, I have found it to be a laborious process with inconsistent results, and  therefore wouldn’t recommend that method. Neither would I suggest you rely on those  websites that take screen shots of a web page in different browsers, because they can’t tell  you whether the mouse, keyboard, and other features are working well, or even at all.  Instead, your best option is to either perform a dual install of Windows alongside Mac  OS X, or ensure you have access to a Windows PC. After all, unless you intend to develop  only for Mac computers, people using a Windows operating system will represent by far the  majority of your users.  As for Linux, not only does it not have access to Internet Explorer, there is no version of  Safari either, although all the other browsers do come in Linux flavors. And, as with OS X,  while various solutions exist that incorporate Wine for running Internet Explorer, they seem  to work only with some distributions and not others, so it can be a bit of a minefield trying  to find a bulletproof way to run Windows browsers on Linux.

Choosing a Program Editor  Long gone are the days of relying on a simple Notepad program for coding. Software for  writing program code has progressed in leaps and bounds in recent years, with text editors  being replaced by powerful program editors that highlight your syntax using different colors  and can quickly locate things for you like matching  and missing  brackets and braces and so on. Table 1-2 lists a number of free program editors that will do a great job of helping you to   write JavaScript code quickly and efficiently.  Which one you choose is largely down to personal preference—in my case I settled on   Notepad++  see Figure 1-1 .  Figure 1-1  The Notepad++ program editor      4   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Program Bluefish        Cream Editra Free HTML Editor jEdit Notepad++  URL bluefish.openoffice.nl cream.sourceforge.net editra.org coffeecup.com free-editor jedit.org notepad-plus.sourceforge.net        Table 1-2  A Selection of Free Program Editors  Windows  Mac  Linux              In most program editors, moving the cursor to different parts of a program usually  allows you to highlight sections of the code. For example, placing the cursor next to any  bracket in Notepad++ automatically highlights the matching one.  Managing Ajax  Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, but the name is really a misnomer  because Ajax is far more than an XML handling technology. It is, in fact, at the heart of all  the modern Web 2.0 websites that exchange information between the web browser and  server in the background, without the user being aware.  To do this, a server side programming language is required, and probably the most   popular one is the PHP scripting language. So, although this isn’t a book about Ajax and  PHP, inevitably some of the plug-ins make use of these technologies and, if you wish to test  them on your development computer, you’ll need to install a web server and PHP  processor. You don’t have to do this if you don’t intend to use any of the Ajax plug-ins,  which are clearly marked as such, but if you do, don’t worry: it really is quite simple.  It’s simple because the developers of PHP have released an all-in-one application called  Zend Server Community Edition  CE  that includes all of PHP, an Apache web server and a  MySQL database. You can download Zend from the following URL:  http:  zend.com products server-ce  Versions are available for all three main operating systems  Windows, Mac OS X, and  Linux , and the installation process is reasonably straightforward, although you’ll need to  carefully read the prompts and make intelligent responses to them. Figure 1-2 shows how  you can easily control Zend Server CE directly from within your web browser.  Tip  If you are interested in PHP programming, my book Plug-in PHP  McGraw-Hill Professional,   2010  contains 100 PHP plug-ins and an entire chapter devoted to installing Zend Server CE  and other PHP solutions on different platforms.  Don’t worry that you’ll need to know how to program in PHP because you won’t, as the  server side scripts can be typed in or downloaded from this book’s companion website—all       C h a p t e r   1 :   M a k i n g   t h e   B e s t   U s e   o f  th e s e  pl u g - i n s     5  Figure 1-2  The Zend Server CE dashboard  you have to do is place them in the same Zend Server CE document root folder as your  HTML and JavaScript files.  Table 1-3 details the default locations of document root that Zend Server CE creates on  different operating systems. If you keep your various HTML, JavaScript, and PHP files in  that folder  and subfolders , then they can all be served up by the Apache web server.  Unfortunately there’s no room to go into much detail about Zend Server CE in this  book, although there is one thing I should mention: you may find the Zend Server CE  document root folder doesn’t allow you to copy files into it by default. If you find this to be  the case, you should change the folder permissions to grant access.

Figure 1-3 shows the breakdown of browsers by use as of  the end of 2009 according to statcounter.com.  As you can see, IE6 and IE7 have over 35 percent of all users between them. Because of  this, and because each version of Internet Explorer works differently, you need to test your  web pages in the older versions in addition to testing them in the latest versions of the   Figure 1-3  Browser market share as of December 2009      C h a p t e r   1 :   M a k i n g   t h e   B e s t   U s e   o f  th e s e  pl u g - i n s     7  main browsers. I know, it’s a pain, but it has to be done. Luckily, there’s a trick to make this  easier than it might otherwise be.  Emulating Internet Explorers 6 and 7 To aid developers who have designed websites to work specifically with older versions, the  developers of Internet Explorer created a meta tab that you can add to the head of a web  page to make IE think it is an earlier version of itself. Here are the two main meta tags you  will use:        This is an example of how to incorporate the IE7 tag:            My Website         ... Website Contents ...  There is no IE=6 option  presumably because the rendering engines for IE5 and IE6 are   so similar , so using the IE=5 option makes Internet Explorer enter what is known as  “quirks” mode, in which it behaves like both IE5 and IE6.  Incidentally, if you wish to force Internet Explorer into full standards mode  to be as   compatible as possible with other browsers  you can use the option IE=8. Without the meta  tag, Internet Explorer will use its proprietary and optimal settings, known as “edge” mode,  which you can also select with the option IE=edge. Of course, once you have finished  testing, you should remove or comment out these meta tags unless you wish to use one for  a particular reason.  In addition to using the meta tags, you should always ensure that you have a suitable   HTML doctype declaration at the start of each document. The most commonly found  doctype is the following, which has been fully tested and works with all of this book’s  plug-ins.   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">  CauTion  If you use a different doctype from the one listed, certain plug-ins may behave differently,   and you may find you have to slightly modify them. I often use both the preceding “loose”  doctype and the IE7 meta tag to get the most compatible results with other major browsers.  Remember, if IE behaves strangely when all other browsers appear to work well with your code,  the solution could be to change the doctype and or IE5 IE7 meta tags. If you are interested in the  subject of browser compatibility and its various nuances, I recommend visiting the Quirks Mode  website at quirksmode.org.      8   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Companion Website  To save you the effort of typing all the plug-ins in this book, you can download them from  this book’s companion website at pluginjavascript.com  see Figure 1-4 .  Click the “Download Plug-ins” link to download the file plug-ins.zip, which is an archive   file  easily extractable on all operating systems  containing all the plug-ins. Once extracted,  in the root of the plug-ins.zip archive you’ll find the files PJ.js and PJsmall.js, which contain  the plug-ins in a ready-to-use form. Also in the root is a file called ReadMe.txt, which  contains the latest details about the plug-ins, including any improvements or updates that  have been made since this book was published.  There are also eleven subfolders labeled from 3 to 13, corresponding to chapters in this   book. Within each folder you’ll find various example HTML and JavaScript files showing the  use of each function that you can load into a browser to try out for yourself. Some plug-ins  also make use of Ajax techniques and may include other associated files  such as those with  .php extensions , in which case they will be documented in the associated chapter.  Figure 1-4  The companion website at pluginjavascript.com      C h a p t e r   1 :   M a k i n g   t h e   B e s t   U s e   o f  th e s e  pl u g - i n s     9  Including All the Plug-ins  The easiest  and recommended  way for you to use these plug-ins is to load them all into a  web page as a complete set, which you can do with the following command, assuming you  saved the file PJ.js into the current folder:      In fact, by default all modern browsers assume that scripts will be JavaScript, so you can   use the following short form, which omits the type= parameter:      Or, if you have PJ.js located elsewhere, such as in the root folder, you change the   command slightly to include the path, like this:  Alternatively, if you use a specific folder for your JavaScript files, such as scripts, you       use this command:      And the compressed version of the file, PJsmall.js, can be included instead, like this:      Immediately following the line that includes the file, you need to add a second line as   follows, which will initialize the plug-ins, ready for use:    Initialize     The benefits of doing this are that you only need to add a couple of lines to your web   pages to have access to all the plug-ins, and there is only one file to change when you  modify any plug-ins. Also, at only around 60KB for the raw JavaScript file, it doesn’t take  very long to load or consume much bandwidth.  What’s more, as already mentioned, you can choose to use the compressed version of  the file, called PJsmall.js, which is under half the size and can be found in the zip file along  with PJ.js. The only difference between the two files is that the larger one has all the  functions shown in plain text where they are easy to see and edit if you wish, and the small  version is tightly compressed and not easy to understand if you view it. Regardless of this  difference, they both work identically to each other.  Including Single Plug-ins  All of the plug-ins included in this book are tightly integrated with each other, and as you  progress through the book you’ll see how the later plug-ins rely more and more on earlier  ones, until you reach the point where plug-ins that would normally require dozens of lines  of code only take up a handful of lines because they can draw on the wealth of features  provided by other plug-ins.      10   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Therefore, because you have the option of using the compressed JavaScript file, which   takes up less space than even most small images, I don’t recommend trying to copy and  paste individual plug-ins into your web pages unless reduced size and bandwidth usage  are essential, because you will have to follow the subfunctions and sub-subfunctions, until  you have located all the dependencies required for a particular plug-in to work.  Where to Include the JavaScript  The best place to insert the plug-ins is in the head section of your web pages so the whole  page will have access to them. The following example  which assumes that PJsmall.js is in  the document root  illustrates the recommended way to insert the file  shown in bold text :            script>PJ_Initialize      My Website         ... Website Contents ...  Placing the code in the head section  means the file of plug-ins will load in first and,   therefore, your own JavaScript code can be placed anywhere you like within the rest of the  web page  including the head  and when it calls one of the plug-in functions it’s guaranteed  to be available.  Cherry Picking Code Sections  Although the primary objective of this book is to provide you with a comprehensive toolkit of  plug-in JavaScript functions to save you having to reinvent the wheel, I also hope that the full  documentation of the plug-ins will make them easy for you to adapt to your own purposes. In  fact, I encourage you to take what you can from this book and extend and improve it.  If that means you want to cherry pick a routine from here and a code snippet from there  and build your own new plug-ins, then this book will have succeeded in its secondary goal  of helping you to take your JavaScript programming skills to the next level.   Bug Fixing and Reporting  The raw JavaScript plug-ins comprise over 2500 lines of code, which has been tested over  and again in as many different conditions as possible. But you should realize that this book  represents a major amount of programming and it is inevitable that some unforeseen bugs  will show up.  Hopefully there aren’t too many of them, and those that there are will be of minimal  consequence. Even so, this means that to ensure you have the latest versions, you should  grab the plug-ins from the companion website at pluginjavascript.com. Speaking of which, if  you come up with any fixes or improvements please send them to me via the website and I’ll  use them to update the source files and improve their capabilities for all readers—you will be       C h a p t e r   1 :   M a k i n g   t h e   B e s t   U s e   o f  th e s e  pl u g - i n s     11  credited in the source code. Please include a note to say that I have your permission to post  your code online and in future editions of this book or, sadly, I will not be able to use it.  Waiting Until the Web Page Has Loaded  Quite often, and particularly on longer web pages, you will not want your JavaScript to run  until all elements in a page have loaded. One reason is that the graphics you’ll be using may  not be ready, or the contents of objects such as divs and spans may not yet be available for  manipulation.  Also, some browsers will return incorrect values when a page hasn’t yet loaded. For  example, if you request the width of the browser too early you may be given a value that  doesn’t include the vertical scroll bar, and therefore if you try to place anything in that part  of the screen  thinking that it is available to you  it will be hidden by a scroll bar.  Some browsers don’t even return a semi-useful value. For instance, when asked for the   location of an object prior to a page loading, Internet Explorer will always return the  coordinates 0,0.  Therefore, you will usually need to place all your JavaScript within the body of the   following function:     window.onload = function    {        Your code and all its functions goes here…  }     This makes it so that your code will not get executed until the very last item has been   loaded into the web page and has been fully rendered. If you get into the habit of enclosing  all your code within this function, you’ll ensure that all objects accessed by it are available  and avoid error messages and initially unsightly web pages.  By the way, although you could move the call to Initialize   here rather than in the     of a web page, I don’t recommend it. Initialize   doesn’t rely on any elements of  the web page since it interacts only with the browser to create global variables and attach  functions to some keyboard and mouse events, so you don’t need to move it here. Also,  placing the call to Initialize   right next to the command that loads in the plug-ins is  sensible practice, as you can’t have one without the other.  Tip  On very busy pages, a long initial delay can be quite annoying because various elements you  will be using are simply loaded in and displayed where they lie within the HTML—only later  reaching their final destinations and dimensions. The first solution to this is to ensure that you  use a CSS  Cascading Style Sheet   more on that in Chapter 2  that is loaded in right at the start.  This will help your page layout to form itself correctly on the fly. Another trick you can use is to  assign zero values to the width and height of objects that you don’t want the user to see until  later, using standard HTML width= and height= keywords  accepted by tables, images, and  other objects . Then, once your code is called up after the page has fully loaded, you can give  these objects their correct dimensions. Or you can use an element’s style argument to make it  invisible, like this: style='display:none', and then change the property to visible when  you are ready to display it.      12   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s  Summary  By now you should have a computer configured as a suitable development workstation and  should know how you intend to include the plug-ins in your web pages. Before moving on  to explaining plug-ins in detail, however, it’s important to make sure you understand the  DOM  Document Object Model  that is used by JavaScript for manipulating elements  within a web page. We’ll take a look at that next, as well as the use of CSS  Cascading  Style Sheets .   Chapter 2  JavaScript, CSS, and the DOM      14   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The great thing about JavaScript is that it could have been designed purely as a stand   alone scripting language and it would still have been very useful. But the developers  did something that would help form the future of the Web, which was to link it to    the HTML Document Object Model  DOM , a way of defining an HTML document in a  structured way that can then be accessed by languages such as JavaScript and Microsoft’s  VBScript  although I don’t cover the latter in this book .  Whenever you see something dynamic happening on a web page such as an image   popping up when you pass the mouse over a link, graphic images zooming out when you  click them, or menus altering according to your selections, this is usually accomplished  using JavaScript, which offers functionality not offered elsewhere other than by Flash or  Java apps—whose scope is limited to the area in which they are embedded.  And speaking of Java, you may be forgiven for thinking that JavaScript is connected with  the Java programming language when, in fact, it has little to do with it; JavaScript was purely  given the name as a marketing ploy to cash in on the popularity of the Java language. Because  of this, some people refer to JavaScript as ECMAScript, but since that doesn’t roll off the  tongue easily, I doubt it will take over as the language’s most popular name.  Anyway, once you have the DOM and a language to access it, you can do almost   anything with a web page, such as easily add new paragraphs; change focus and select text;  replace images; play sound effects, music, and videos; and much more.  When you add Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  to the mixture you can apply style changes  to a page, completely changing the way it looks, without altering the HTML. Actually, CSS  has something in common with JavaScript in that certain style settings can apply dynamic  effects to page elements such as changing their color and other properties when the mouse  passes over them  as you’ll see implemented in some of the plug-ins .  Therefore the plug-ins in this book use both CSS and JavaScript to achieve the required   functionality in the simplest and easiest way possible. But in order to understand what is  going on in many of the plug-ins, it’s important that you first have a grounding in both the  DOM and CSS.  Tip  You may already be experienced with programming in JavaScript and using CSS and the  DOM. If so, you may wish to simply skim through this chapter for a quick refresher on the  subject. But if you are relatively new to JavaScript I recommend you familiarize yourself with the  contents of this chapter, because the plug-ins in this book are built on the principles discussed.  The Document Object Model  DOM   The Document Object Model  DOM  separates the different parts of an HTML document  into a hierarchy of discrete objects, each one having its own properties and methods.  Methods are functions that can do something with an object, while properties are attributes  of an object such as the value it holds in the case of a text object, or its width and height in  case of an image, and so on.  The outermost object possible is the window object, which is the current browser   window, tab, or popped up window. Underneath this is the document object, of which there  can be more than one  such as several documents loaded into different frames within a  page . Inside a document there are other objects such as the head and body of a page.      C h a p t e r   2 :   J a v a S c r i p t ,   C S S ,   a n d   t h e   D O M    15  Within the head there can be other objects such as the title and meta objects, while the  body object can contain numerous other objects, including HTML tags such as headings,  anchors, forms, and so forth.  Figure 2-1 shows the DOM of an example document, with the title “Hello” and a meta   tag in the head section and three HTML elements  a link, a form, and an image  in the   body section.  Of course even the simplest of web pages has more structure than outlined in this   figure, but it serves to show how the DOM works; starting from the very outside of the  DOM is the window, inside which there’s a single document  although more are allowed ,  and within the document are the various elements or objects, which connect to each other. The only one of the items in the figure that is a property is the string “Hello,” which is  the property of the title object. All the other items are objects or object argument names.   If the figure were to extend further down, the property for the meta name might be found  to be “robots” and the URL property for the a href could be “google.com,” and so on.  Representing this as HTML code the structure of the head section looks like this:               Hello      The meta tag in this case is one that allows search engines and other web crawlers     or robots  to index the page and follow any links found within it.  The body section of HTML looks like this:         Visit Google                                          window document  head  body  meta  name  title  Hello  a  form  href  input  img  src  Figure 2-1  Example of a DOM showing head and body sections      16   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Remembering that these two sections of HTML are part of the same document, you   bring them both together inside an   tag, like this:                           Hello                      Visit Google                                                            Of course, a web page can look quite different from this, but it should follow the same   form. Even though modern browsers are very forgiving and allow you to omit many things,  such as the opening and closing tags, I don’t recommend you do this, because one day you  might want to convert your page to XHTML, which is a lot stricter. It’s always a good idea  to close every tag and make sure you do so in the right order. For example, you shouldn’t  close a document by issuing   followed by   because the proper nesting of  tags would be broken.  For the same reason, you should also get into the habit of closing any tags that do not   have a closing version, such as  , which does not have a matching    tag, and therefore requires a   character right before the final > in order to properly close it.  In the same way   becomes  , and so on.  You should also remember that arguments within tags must have either single or double   quotation marks to be XHTML compatible, even though nearly all browsers allow you to  omit them.  NoTe  In the early days of the Web, when most users had very slow dial-up modems, it was common   to see all manner of things such as quotation marks and various tags omitted from web pages.  Nowadays, most of your users will have fairly decent bandwidth speeds, and there’s no longer  any reason to do this.  Accessing the DOM from JavaScript You may have wondered why I gave the form an ID of “login,” and the first input tag an ID  of “name”  and the value “fred” . The reason is to show how JavaScript handles all of this  DOM nesting quite easily with the use of the period character. For example, some standard  properties such as the document title can be read like this:  title = document.title      C h a p t e r   2 :   J a v a S c r i p t ,   C S S ,   a n d   t h e   D O M    17     Figure 2-2  The pop-up window  shows the input  value.  But in order to access most other object properties you need to assign an ID to the object.   For example, once the name is assigned to the input field, you can find its current value    if any , in the following manner, which assigns the value to the variable username:  username = document.forms.login.name.value  The reason that .value is added after .name  but not after .title in the preceding  example  is that .title is already a property, whereas .name is a form input object that  itself has properties, including its value in .value.  The reason for prepopulating the input statement with the value “fred” also becomes  apparent if you add the following four lines of code before the closing   tag, and  then load the preceding example into a browser:        document.write document.title      alert document.forms.login.name.value      The browser will then display the value of document.title just after the missing   graphic icon, which is there because the image photo11.jpg doesn’t exist, and the current value  of the input statement, “fred”, is also displayed in a pop-up alert  shown in Figure 2-2 .  Cascading Style Sheets  Using CSS, you can apply styles to your web pages to make them look exactly how you want.  This works because CSS is connected to the DOM so that you can quickly and easily restyle  any element. For example, if you don’t like the default look of the  ,  , and other  heading tags, you can assign new styles to override the default settings for the font family and  size used, or whether bold or italics should be set and many more properties, too.      18   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The main way you add styling to a web page is similar to including JavaScript; you   insert the required statements in the head of a web page between the   and    tags. To change the style of the   tag you might use the following code:        h1 { color:red; font-size:3em; font-family:Arial }     Within an HTML page this might look like the following  see Figure 2-3 :                             h1 { color:red; font-size:3em; font-family:Arial }                  Hello World                Hello there            Or you can use one of the preferred methods of including a style sheet, which is   particularly useful when you wish to style a whole site, rather than a single page.  The first way you can do this is by using the CSS @import directive, in place of a   sequence of style statements, like this:        @import url " css styles.css" ;     This statement tells the browser to fetch a style sheet with the name styles.css from the    css folder. The @import command is quite flexible in that you can create style sheets that  themselves pull in other style sheets, and so on. Just make sure that there are no   or    tags in any of your external style sheets or they will not work.     Figure 2-3  Styling the    tag, with the  original style  shown in the  smaller window      C h a p t e r   2 :   J a v a S c r i p t ,   C S S ,   a n d   t h e   D O M    19  You can also include a style sheet using the HTML   tag, as follows:     This has the exact same effect as the @import directive, except that the   tag is not a   valid style directive, and so it cannot be used from within one style sheet to pull in another— and it, therefore, should also not be placed within a pair of   …   tags. Just as  you can use multiple @import directives within your CSS to include multiple external style  sheets, you can also use as many   statements as you like in your HTML.  There’s also nothing stopping you from using external style sheets and then overriding  certain styles for the current page by inserting style statements, either with   …     tags or directly within HTML, like this  which results in italic blue text within   the tags :   Hello   A better solution is to change the HTML by assigning a class value, as follows:   Hello   Then you can use the following style setting, either in the page header or within an   external style sheet for referring to the class:  .iblue { font-style:italic; color:blue; }  Of course, if you use another style inside the div, then any attributes that are the same  will override those of the div styling. In the case of the   tag that was styled earlier, the  font color of red that was assigned to   will override the iblue class setting of blue, but  the other .iblue attribute of italic text will stay unaltered—resulting in the same Arial font  “Hello there” text as Figure 2-3, except that it will be changed to italic.  Properly explaining CSS would easily fill a large book, so these are just the bare bones  basics you need to know in order to understand what is going on in the plug-ins. If you are  interested in learning more about the subjects of XHTML and CSS in depth, I recommend  the book HTML & XHTML: The Complete Reference, by Thomas A. Powell  McGraw-Hill  Professional, 2003 .  Accessing Styles in JavaScript  Using JavaScript you can also change on the fly many of the same styles you can define  using CSS. This is possible because the CSS attributes are also DOM object properties. For  example, here’s how you use CSS to set an attribute for a particular ID:  under { text-decoration:underline; }  Any text within the element that has an ID of under will now be underlined. This   element can also be accessed from JavaScript, so let’s change it to another decoration type  with this JavaScript statement:  document.getElementById 'under' .style.textDecoration = 'line-through'      20   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     All text items within the under ID will now be changed from underlined to line-  through. To help make this clearer, the following example combines these two statements  into a working HTML page  see Figure 2-4 :                             *under { text-decoration:underline; }                     Hello World                 How are you?           A second line          And a third                     document.getElementById 'under' .style.textDecoration =              'line-through'                    Straight away you can see from the figure that the “How are you” text has been changed   to line-through, but take a look at the two lines underneath; they are both still underlined.  The reason for this is that the same ID name was used multiple times, but JavaScript acted  only on the first instance.     CSS may have allowed the use of an ID as if it were a class  which applies to a group of   elements, rather than just one , but JavaScript certainly doesn’t; as soon as it finishes  modifying the first instance it stops because it assumes that the job is done. Therefore, the  two lines following are not changed by the script.  This serves to illustrate a problem a beginner to CSS may encounter: some styles you   apply may seem to work, but it’s only as a side effect of how the browser implements them.  In this case it reminds you to always use an ID for identifying a single element and a class  for multiple ones.  By the way, modifying a class attribute can be done from JavaScript but it requires stepping   through the elements in a document to locate each occurrence and then changing it.     Figure 2-4  Using JavaScript to  change an attribute  from underline to  line-through      C h a p t e r   2 :   J a v a S c r i p t ,   C S S ,   a n d   t h e   D O M    21  If you would like to learn more about CSS, I recommend the book Dynamic Web   Programming: A Beginner's Guide, by Marty Matthews and John Cronan  McGraw-Hill  Professional, 2009 .  JavaScript and Semicolons  There are some JavaScript programmers who always place a semicolon at the end of every  statement, but it isn’t necessary to do so because JavaScript interpreters accept either a  semicolon or a new line as the end marker for a statement.  However, if you wish to have more than one statement in a line, you must use a   semicolon between them. In this book I try to avoid this to keep the code as readable as  possible.  On the other hand, using semicolons everywhere makes your JavaScript code more   easily convertible to languages such as PHP and C, which require them. But it’s up to you  whether or not you use them.  Tip  Some programs that work with JavaScript directly to help find bugs or optimize or reduce your  code will not work unless you have placed a semicolon after every single statement. If you will   be using any of these you’ll save a lot of time by getting into the habit of using semicolons   right away.  Summary  If this is all new to you, you should now have a very basic picture of how JavaScript, CSS,  and the DOM relate to each other. This will help you understand the plug-in documentation  in the following chapters. In them, I provide all the information you need to effectively use  the plug-ins on your own pages, as well as how to modify and improve them for your own  purposes.   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 3  the Core plug-ins      24   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     In my previous book, Plug-in PHP  McGraw-Hill Professional, 2010  I was able to draw   upon the wealth of ready-made functions supplied with the language. However, this  hasn’t turned out to be the case with JavaScript, so this chapter concentrates on   providing a selection of basic functions needed in order to be able to develop JavaScript  programs as quickly and efficiently as possible.  This chapter contains more plug-ins than any other chapter  18 in all , as well as a   collection of handy global variables that will make your life much simpler, and will make  the remaining plug-ins easier to understand and modify.  Since these core plug-ins and global variables are used throughout the book I recommend  you take the time to digest the contents of this chapter as fully as possible before starting to  use the remaining functions. I apologize in advance for the amount of documentation on  these first few plug-ins, but they are important ones, and it’s essential that you are fully  familiar with their use.    1  O   The O   function is the most fundamental of the plug-ins provided in this book and is used  by almost all the others. In its simplest form it replaces the long-winded JavaScript function  name getElementById  , which takes the string argument supplied to it and then returns  the HTML DOM  Document Object Model  object that has been assigned that ID. The letter  O is short for the word Object since the main purpose of this function is to retrieve an object  or to modify its properties.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes one required and two optional arguments as follows:   	 id  This can be a string containing the ID of an object, an object, or even an array  containing several objects and or object IDs. If none of the optional arguments are  also provided then the function returns the object or objects represented by id. If  there are optional arguments then the purpose of the function changes to assign the  value in value to the property in property of the object  or objects  in id.   	 property  This optional string argument can contain the name of a property   belonging to the object  or objects  in id that requires modifying   	 value   If this optional argument is set it represents the value to be assigned to the  property in property of the object  or objects  in id. Both the property and value  arguments must have values, otherwise O   will simply return the object  or  objects  in id.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  tmp[]  j  UNDEF  InsVars    Array holding the result of processing the id array Integer loop variable for indexing into id Global string variable with the value ‘undefined’ Plug-in to insert values into a string      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     25  push    substr    eval    try    catch    getElementById  Function to push a value onto an array Function to return a substring from a string Function to evaluate a string as JavaScript code Function to run a function passing an any error to a matching  catch   statement Function called when a try   statement fails Function to return an object by its name  How It Works This plug-in does a lot more than simply provide a shortened name for an existing function,  because you can pass it either the string ID name of an object, or the object itself. For  example, consider the following HTML div:  Using the O   plug-in you can access the div object directly with the following command:    …    mydiv = O 'outerdiv'   This command is equivalent to the following, which sets the variable mydiv to represent   the div object that has the ID of ‘outerdiv’:   mydiv = document.getElementById 'outerdiv'   This means that you can, for example, use the value returned by this plug-in to change  the HTML contents of the div  the text between its opening and closing tags  as follows, by  modifying its innerHTML property:  mydiv.innerHTML = " A Heading "  Or, you can bypass assigning the object to a variable and access the object directly from   the O   plug-in, like this:  O 'outerdiv' .innerHTML = ' A Heading '  Passing Either Strings or Objects The O   function is also very versatile in that sometimes you may have a variable  containing a string name, like this:  myvariable = 'outerdiv'  myvariable = O 'outerdiv'   On the other hand, it can represent the actual object itself, like this:  The former contains simply the string of characters comprising 'outerdiv', while the  latter is an object. Because the job of O   is to return the object referred to by the string       26   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     name it is passed, if you happen to pass it an object instead of a string it will simply return  that object back to you. Therefore whether myvariable contains a string that refers to an  object or the object itself, you can use just the one statement to access it, like this:  othervariable = O myvariable   Or like this:  O myvariable .innerHTML = ' A Subheading '  Note that there are no quotation marks around myvariable in this instance because a   variable, not a string, is being passed.  Note  I have used single quotation marks in these examples but JavaScript allows you to use either   single or double quotation marks. However, for the sake of standardization I usually use single  quotes for strings, unless a string includes a single quotes within it. In which case I use double  quotation marks to enclose the string.  Additional Arguments As well as accepting strings and objects, the O   plug-in allows you to pass it an optional  pair of arguments that are then used to modify object properties. For example, the previous  examples can also be rewritten like this:  O 'outerdiv', 'innerHTML', ' A Heading '   O myvariable, 'innerHTML', ' A Subheading '   Both of the preceding are acceptable alternative syntax for assigning a value to an   object’s property.  Passing Arrays You may be wondering about the point of this alternative syntax. Well, it comes into its own  when you want to access many different objects at a time. This is something that you cannot  do with standard JavaScript, but you can achieve it with the O   plug-in, which allows you  to pass an array of objects, object ID names, or a combination of both.  For example, let’s say that you would like to clear the HTML contents of three objects   that have the names ‘Fred’, ‘Mary’, and ‘Bill’. Regular JavaScript would require three  separate commands, but you can easily achieve the same result with the following code:  ids = Array 'Fred', 'Mary', 'Bill'   O ids, 'innerHTML', ''   You can even mix objects and object ID names within an array, as follows:  ids = Array 'Fred', 'Mary', 'Bill', myobject   Or, you can combine everything into one line of code in the following way, which will   clear out the innerHTML contents of all the objects:  O Array 'Fred', 'Mary', 'Bill', myobject , 'innerHTML', ''       C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     27  Figure 3-1 shows a group of three divs that have all had their innerHTML properties set   to the same value, using the code in the following example web page:  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"     "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">     Plug-in JavaScript          Initialize             Fred:      Mary:      Bill:          ids = Array 'Fred', 'Mary', 'Bill'   O ids, 'innerHTML', 'New contents...'            This is the first time that you have seen a complete example of using the plug-ins. It  begins with the   setting, then adds both the page’s   and the two    lines required to include and set up the plug-ins. After that the   is closed  and the   of the page is opened. Then three lines of HTML create simple    sections that don’t contain any content.  Finally, there is another   section in which the contents of these spans is   changed so that each displays the string ‘New contents...’. This is the format that most  standard web pages will follow when using the plug-ins. The result of loading this page  into a browser is shown in Figure 3-1.  Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to use the plug-ins and where the different parts fit  within a web page, throughout the rest of this book’s examples I will omit everything before   and including  the   tag  except where a plug-in affects that particular section  and  concentrate only on the relevant HTML and JavaScript required to explain the use of a  plug-in.  Figure 3-1    Changing the  HTML contents of  objects using O        28   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     When an Array Is Passed The o   plug-in comprises three parts. The first one tests the argument id to see if it is an  array, which it does by using the instanceof operator, like this:  if  id instanceof Array  …  If it is an array then more than one object has been passed to the function, so the array  tmp is declared as a local array  that can only be accessed by this instance of this function   using the var keyword, like this:  var tmp = []  Then a for   loop iterates through the array, using the integer variable j as an index   pointer to each individual array element.  Making Recursive Calls Interestingly, the O   function is called again within each iteration, but just with the single  element located at the current array index pointed to by j. This is known as a recursive  function call, meaning that the function calls itself. It’s a very neat way to reuse code to get a  job done once you have broken it down into a more manageable chunk. The loop code looks  like this:  for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j      tmp.push O id[j], property, value    To explain how it works in this instance, one element has been extracted from an array   of elements and then that element is passed back to the same function, which will then  process that element and return a value back to itself. So, for example, if an array of items is  passed to O  , it will be iterated through in stages, each time passing one element from the  array in turn to the same function, until all elements have been processed.  Looked at from the function’s receiving end, when it sees that it has received a single   item  and not an array , control flow drops through to the remaining code, where that item  is processed and whatever value or object is calculated is returned. Upon return from the  function  back to the same function , the result of the function call is placed in the next free  location in the tmp array by using the JavaScript push   function and is promptly forgotten  about  since it has been dealt with , and the next element of the array is then processed.  Once all elements are done with  in other words, the value of j equals the number of   items in the array, as indicated by id.length , the array tmp is returned to the calling code. You will notice that the variables property and value are not treated as arrays, because   they aren’t. If the variable property has a value it should be the name of an object’s  property, and value will contain the value to assign to that property. These arguments are  optional but can be used to give the same value to the same properties of all objects in an  array. Because the function calls itself recursively, it also has to pass property and value   whether or not they have values  along with the object to be processed, otherwise if they  have values they will be lost.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     29  tip  If you’re new to recursion and it seems somewhat complicated to you, try reading through this   section a couple more times and you should soon get the hang of it. Wikipedia also has quite a  good explanation of the concept at wikipedia.org wiki Recursion, and no, it doesn’t just say  “see Recursion”!  Processing the Additional Arguments In the previous section I talked about property and value, the optional arguments for  modifying an object’s properties. The second main section of this function is where that  modification happens. The code starts by testing whether or not both property and value  have a value by using the typeof operator, like this:  if  typeof property != UNDEF &&  typeof value != UNDEF   The variable UNDEF is a global variable that has been assigned the value ‘undefined’ by   the Initialize   function, which is detailed a little later.  Both arguments must have a value for this if   statement to execute. If they do, it’s   time to make another recursive call, passing the value of id back to the same function. This  illustrates the power of the O   plug-in in that you never have to worry whether the main  argument you pass it is an object or the ID name of an object; either is acceptable, and so  this part of the function simply passes on the value of id, whatever type of variable it is.  Inside this if   statement the eval   function is used to assign the value to the   property, first surrounding the value with single quotation marks if it is a string  otherwise,  eval   would try to evaluate it, rather than treat it as a string :  if  typeof value == 'string'  value = "'" + value + "'"  return eval "O '" + id + "' ." + property + " = " + value   The value returned by eval   is then returned by the function.  At the Deepest Level The remaining lines of the plug-in execute only when id is not an array and when no  optional parameters have been passed. Since they come after both of the sections that can  make recursive calls, they are the place where the function ultimately returns from these  recursive calls.  These lines also represent the heart of the O   function in that they will return an object   by providing its ID name. The code look like this:  if  typeof id == 'object'  return id  else  {     try { return document.getElementById id  }     catch e  { alert 'PJ - Unknown ID: ' + id  }  }  The first line ends function execution if id is an object, by simply returning it. Otherwise an   attempt is made to return the object whose ID is id. Sometimes, though, you will accidentally  pass an ID to the O   function that hasn’t yet been assigned. If this happens, rather than having       30   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     JavaScript come to a halt  which it would do if the object doesn’t exist , an error message alert  is displayed to let you know this has happened.  This is achieved by using a pair of try   … catch   functions. The first tries the code   and passes execution to the second if there is an error.  You may wish to remove the alert   call in a production website so that your users   won’t see any errors that you might leave in your code. However, remember that trying to  access a nonexistent object is a critical error that stops all program flow, and you really don’t  want to leave any such errors in your production code.  How To Use It This plug-in has two distinct modes. In the first it returns an object referred to by an ID  string, while in the second it updates an object’s property with a new value. In either case, if  the object itself is passed to the plug-in  instead of its ID name  then the object is accessed  directly, since there’s no need to look it up.  Furthermore, in both lookup and property setting modes you can pass an array of   objects and or ID names. If you are looking up objects, the plug-in returns an array. If you  are setting properties, all the objects have the specified property set to the given value, and  those values are returned.  However, the value returned by the plug-in is really only of use when looking up an   object, such as in the following, which are just four of the countless ways of using the  plug-in:  objectname = O 'mydiv'   O 'copyrightspan' .innerHTML = '&copy; 2011'   background = O 'menu' .style.backgroundColor  O 'menu' .style.color = 'yellow'  When you are assigning a value to one or more properties, as in the following examples,  the returned value will simply be that of the assigned value, which is not that useful to you,  except perhaps when you are debugging code:  O objectname, 'innerHTML', ' Heading Text ’   O Array 'first', 'second' , 'mouseover', 'mousehandler'   As you will see throughout this book, the O   plug-in is used in a variety of different   ways, and you will soon get used to thinking of it as the main way to access individual  elements in a webpage.  Note  Well known JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery, Script.aculo.us Prototype, and many  others, make use of a similar function to O  , but they usually call it $  . Some add even more  functionality to it than there is in the O   plug-in, which makes it even more powerful, but also  more complicated too. The $ is a sensible choice of character for naming such functions as it’s  short and instantly recognizable. However I have deliberately not used the same convention  precisely because other frameworks do use it. That way the plug-ins in this book should be less  likely to conflict with third-party frameworks if you use them both on the same web pages.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     31  The Plug-in function O id, property, value   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        var tmp = []         for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            tmp.push O id[j], property, value          return tmp     }       if  typeof property !=  UNDEF && typeof value != UNDEF      {        if  typeof value == 'string'  value = "'" + value + "'"        return eval "O '" + id + "' ." + property + " = " + value      }       if  typeof id == 'object'  return id     else     {        try { return document.getElementById id  }        catch e  { alert 'PJ - Unknown ID: ' + id  }     }  }    2  S   Probably the most common use to which JavaScript is put is modifying CSS properties in  HTML documents. These include colors, dimensions, location, opacity, and much more.  Generally this is done using code such as the following, which changes the foreground text  color of a div:  document.getElement.ById 'element' .style.color = 'red'  Or, using the previous plug-in, this can be shortened to:  O 'element' .style.color = 'red'  This is such a common action that I have created a companion plug-in to O   called S      for Style , which deals with handling an object’s style subobject. Using it, the preceding  commands can be reduced to the following:  S 'element' .color = 'red'  Figure 3-2 shows the plug-in being used to change the background colors of the three  divs. Even though the figure is not in color, you can tell that by their shades that the divs  are different colors.      32   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 3-2    Using S   to  change the  background colors  of some divs  About the Plug-in The S   plug-in is similar to O   with the exception that instead of referencing an object,  that object’s style subobject is accessed. Also, since events are not used by it there is no  need to check for them in this function. It accepts the following arguments:   	 id  This can be a string containing the ID of an object, an object, or even an array  containing several objects and or object IDs. If none of the optional arguments are  also provided then the function returns the style subobject of the object  or objects   represented by id. If there are optional arguments, then the purpose of the function  changes to assign the value in value to the property in property of the style  subobject of the object  or objects  in id.   	 property  This optional string argument can contain the name of a property   belonging to the style subobject of the object  or objects  in id that requires  modifying.   	 value   If this optional argument is set it represents the value to be assigned to the   property in property of the style subobject of the object  or objects  in id. Both  the property and value arguments must have values, otherwise S   will simply  return the style subobject of the object  or objects  in id.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  tmp[]  j  style  push    try    catch    O    Array holding the result of processing the id array Integer loop variable for indexing into id Style subobject Function to push a value onto an array Function to run a function passing an any error to a matching catch    statement Function called when a try   statement fails Plug-in 1, the main “object” function. Since O   or S   are both used by  almost all plug-ins, this is the last time either will be listed in a “Variables,  Arrays, and Functions” section.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     33  How It Works Now that you understand how the O   plug-in works, you will have an idea how this one  functions. Because it is so similar, I’ll just outline the basics.  As with O  , this function has three main parts. The first processes id if it happens to be  an array. It does this by recursively calling itself with each element within the array so as to  deal with each one separately. The code that does this is as follows, with the final line  returning an array of all the values returned during the process:  if  id instanceof Array   {     var tmp = []     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         tmp.push S id[j], property, value       return tmp  }  The second section handles the case when you are using the plug-in in its property   assigning mode. It determines this by checking whether both the arguments property and  value have values. If they do, then the property in property of the style subobject of the  object represented by id is assigned the value in value.  Otherwise the object fetching mode is entered, and so the style subobject of id is returned. However, for the reasons given in the previous section, accessing the object is embedded   within try   statements so that any errors can be caught and displayed via a call to  alert  , using the matching catch   statements:  if  typeof property != UNDEF && typeof value != UNDEF   {     try { return O id .style[property] = value }     catch e  { alert 'PJ - Unknown ID: ' + id  }  }  else if  typeof id == 'object'  return id.style  else  {     try { return O id .style }     catch e  { alert 'PJ - Unknown ID: ' + id  }  }  During development you will find this error catching very useful, as mistyping ID   names or accessing them before they have been declared are common errors.  Note  I refer to the style subobject, but I could also call it the style property, because it is both:  it’s a property called style, which is itself an object that has properties. Therefore I tend to refer  to properties that are also objects as a subobjects.  How To Use It You use the plug-in in much the same way as you use the O   function. With it you can  either fetch the style subobject of an object, or you can modify one of the style properties of       34   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     that object. Here’s one way you could use the plug-in to first fetch and then use an object’s  style subobject:  var styleobject = S 'mydiv'   styleobject.backgroundColor = 'cyan'  Or, you can access the style subobject directly, like this:  S 'mydiv' .backgroundColor = 'cyan'  If you wish, you can also set the value of a property from within the plug-in like this:  S 'mydiv', 'backgroundColor', 'cyan'   This latter form also allows you to set style properties for several objects at once, like this:  ids = Array 'one', 'two', 'three'   S ids, 'backgroundColor', 'cyan'   In this case, all the objects in the ids array will have their backgroundColor style  property set to ‘cyan’. Omitting the head section and any other parts of the web page, the  code used to create the output in Figure 3-2 is as follows:  Fred:      Mary:      Bill:          ids = Array 'Fred', 'Mary', 'Bill'   O ids, 'innerHTML', 'New contents...'   S 'Fred' .backgroundColor = 'red'  S 'Mary' .backgroundColor = 'blue'  S 'Bill' .backgroundColor = 'green'     First, the divs are created within HTML, then a section of JavaScript follows in which   the ids array is populated with the three ID names of the divs. After that, the O   plug-in is  used to assign vales to the innerHTML properties of these divs as a group, and then each  div’s backgroundColor property is individually set using three separate calls to S  .  Over the coming chapters you will see the S   plug-in used in many different contexts,   and I think you’ll find that in future you’ll never want to access style properties in any  other way.  The Plug-in function S id, property, value   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        var tmp = []        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j        C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     35           tmp.push S id[j], property, value          return tmp     }       if  typeof property != UNDEF && typeof value != UNDEF      {        try { return O id .style[property] = value }        catch e  { alert 'PJ - Unknown ID: ' + id  }     }     else if  typeof id == 'object'  return id.style     else     {        try { return O id .style }        catch e  { alert 'PJ - Unknown ID: ' + id  }     }  }    3  Initialize   In order to set up the plug-ins ready to use, you will have to call up a small initialization  plug-in at the start of your web pages. As previously mentioned, I recommend you always  include the following two lines of code at the start of each one:       Initialize     Or if you are using the compressed version of the plug-ins, PJsmall.js, then you would   use that file in place of PJ.js.  This plug-in is the Initialize   function that is called by that code, and it prepares a  wide range of functionality you can draw on, as shown in Figure 3-3, in which the browser  type is detected.  About the Plug-in This plug-in requires no arguments and doesn’t return any. However, please refer to the  table of variables, arrays, and functions in the next section, as some very important global  variables are set up by it.     Figure 3-3  Displaying the  variable BROWSER  after calling this  plug-in      36   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  MOUSE_DOWN  MOUSE_IN  MOUSE_X  MOUSE_Y  SCROLL_X  SCROLL_Y  KEY_PRESS  ZINDEX  CHAIN_CALLS  INTERVAL  UNDEF  HID  VIS  ABS  FIX  REL  TP  BM  LT  RT  BROWSER  NavCheck    Global integer set to true if a mouse button is currently held down,  otherwise false Global integer set to true if the mouse pointer is currently within the  browser window, otherwise false Global integer containing the current horizontal coordinate of the mouse  pointer Global integer containing the current vertical coordinate of the mouse  pointer Global integer containing the amount the browser has been scrolled  vertically, in pixels Global integer containing the amount the browser has been scrolled  horizontally, in pixels Global integer containing the value of the last key pressed Global integer containing the maximum z-index of any object accessed via  the plug-ins Global array containing plug-ins that have been chained together and which  are yet to be executed Global integer containing the time in milliseconds between calls to a  repeated event Global string containing the value ‘undefined’ Global string containing the value ‘hidden’ Global string containing the value ‘visible’ Global string containing the value ‘absolute’ Global string containing the value ‘fixed’ Global string containing the value ‘relative’ Global string containing the value ‘top’ Global string containing the value ‘bottom’ Global string containing the value ‘left’ Global string containing the value ‘right’ Global string containing the name of the current browser Subfunction to check for the existence of a string in the browser User  Agent string  How It Works Let’s look first at each of this plug-in’s global variable definitions:   	    This integer variable is updated by the two inline, anonymous   MOUSE_DOWN functions  later in the plug-in  that are attached to the document.onmouseup and  document.onmousedown events. With it you can quickly make a check to see       C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     37  whether or not a mouse button is being pressed anywhere in the browser window  by simply looking at this variable, which has a value of true if down; otherwise it is  set to false.   	 MOUSE_IN   In a similar fashion, the document.onmouseout and document   .onmouseover events are captured, and this global variable is set to true when the  mouse pointer is within the bounds of the browser window; otherwise it is set to  false.   	 MOUSE_X and	MOUSE_Y  This pair of global variables is constantly updated by the  CaptureMouse   plug-in  the plug-in following this one , which is attached to the  document.onmousemove event. Therefore, you can reference these variables at any  time to determine the position of the mouse pointer.   	 SCROLL_X and SCROLL_Y  These global variables are also kept updated by the   CaptureMouse   plug-in. They are continuously updated with values representing  the amount by which the browser has scrolled in both vertical and horizontal  directions.   	 KEY_PRESS  This global variable is updated by the CaptureKeyboard   plug-in,  which captures the document.onkeydown and document.onkeypress events and  sets the variable depending on the key that was pressed.   	 ZINDEX  This global variable starts off with a default value of 1,000. It is used by   the plug-ins to determine the zIndex property of objects it uses. This is the depth at  which it will be displayed on the screen, with lower or negative numbers being  behind higher and positive numbers. For example, the ContextMenu   plug-in in  Chapter 8, which opens a drop-down element when you right-click, uses this value  to ensure that the element it displays appears in front of all other windows. Also, the  BrowserWindow   plug-in  also in Chapter 8 , which creates in-browser, moveable  pop-up windows, sets windows that are clicked to the value of ZINDEX + 1, to  ensure that they come to the front.   	 CHAIN_CALLS  Some of the plug-ins have the ability to be chained together so that  they run consecutively, each one starting after the previous has finished. Normally,  JavaScript doesn’t allow such behavior and, if you call up a function that, for example,  sets up an interrupt to perform an animation, that function will return immediately to  the calling code without waiting for the sequence of interrupts to complete. This is  exactly the behavior normally required, as it allows other things to happen at the  same time. But some of these plug-ins work better when they are chained, which is  achieved by placing a sequence of functions in the CHAIN_CALLS array so that as  each function completes, the next in the chain can be called. The only reasons you  might want to access this array are either to determine if  and how many  functions  are queued up, or possibly to empty the array to cancel all queued up functions.   	 INTERVAL  After many hours of experimentation on all the major browsers   across a range of computers and operating systems, I have derived a value of   30 milliseconds as being the optimal time to allow between interrupt calls, because  some shorter functions complete in under 10 milliseconds, while others may take   20 or more, but none should take any longer than 30 milliseconds. Therefore, I have       38   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     set the global variable INTERVAL to 30. This fixed value is required for timing  purposes,  so that all the interrupt functions in this book can ensure that they take  exactly the number of milliseconds passed to them. If JavaScript speeds creep up  over the next few years, as they inevitably do, this allows you to optimize these  plug-ins and drop the value of this variable to 25, 20, 15, or even fewer milliseconds,  as computers get faster and JavaScript interpreters improve. This will not speed up  the plug-ins, but it will allow animations to have extra steps between the first and  last frame, making the transitions smoother.  Global String Variables After these first ten global variables, a further ten global string variables are defined. These  are UNDEF, HID, VIS, ABS, FIX, REL, STA, INH, TP, BM, LT and RT, and in order they stand for  the strings ‘undefined’, ‘hidden’, ‘visible’, ‘absolute’, ‘fixed’, ‘relative’, ‘static’, ‘inherit’, ‘top’,  ‘bottom’, ‘left’ and ‘right’.  Although they are not essential, I have created these variables because the strings to   which they refer are used frequently by the plug-ins, and this helps to keep the code more  compact. It also serves to make the listings in this book narrower, so that lines that might  previously have wrapped around now display on a single line. Additionally, they help to  make the code more readable, as long as you refer back to this section if you forget the  values of any of them.  Determining the Current Browser Because JavaScript varies in its implementation between different developers, you sometimes  need to know which browser you are dealing with. So, in conjunction with the subfunction  NavCheck  , the next ten lines of code will set the global variable BROWSER to one out of the  following strings, depending on the browser used: ‘IE’, ‘Opera’, ‘Chrome’,’iPod’, ‘iPhone’,  ‘iPad’, ‘Android’, ‘Safari’, ‘Firefox’, and ‘UNKNOWN’. You can then refer to this variable in the  same way that some of the plug-ins do in order to offer different code to different browsers.  When ‘Firefox’ is returned it means that a browser running on the Gecko rendering engine is in  use, which includes browsers other than Firefox.  Attaching Functions to Events Much of the functionality of these plug-ins rests on the capturing of various built-in  browser events, as is done by the remaining seven lines of code. The first three attach   the CaptureMouse   function to the document.ommousemove event, and the  CaptureKeyboard   function to the document.onkeydown and document.onkeypress  events. What these plug-ins do is documented in their own sections, but suffice it to say  that they are called each time one of those events occurs and they keep the global variable  KEY_PRESS updated.  The final four lines attach functions that are so small that I have created them as   anonymous, inline functions. All they do is capture the document.onmouseout, document  .onmouseover, document.onmouseup and document.onmousedown events, keeping the  global variables MOUSE_IN and MOUSE_DOWN updated.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     39  How To Use It To use this plug-in you must ensure it is called prior to calling any other plug-ins, and you must  call this plug-in in order for almost all the plug-ins to work. If you wish to check that it has  been successfully called, you can try issuing the following statement from within    tags, which will display the name of the browser being used, as shown in Figure 3-3:  alert 'Your browser is ' + BROWSER   However, you will normally wish to use this and the other plug-ins only once a page   has fully loaded and all its elements locations and dimensions are known and can be  manipulated. Therefore, the command  and the rest of your code  is best placed within   a window.onload anonymous function, like this:  window.onload = function    {     alert "Your browser is " + BROWSER   }  The Plug-in function Initialize    {     MOUSE_DOWN  = false     MOUSE_IN    = true     MOUSE_X     = 0     MOUSE_Y     = 0     SCROLL_X    = 0     SCROLL_Y    = 0     KEY_PRESS   = ''     ZINDEX      = 1000     CHAIN_CALLS = []     INTERVAL    = 30       UNDEF = 'undefined'     HID   = 'hidden'     VIS   = 'visible'     ABS   = 'absolute'     FIX   = 'fixed'     REL   = 'relative'     STA   = 'static'     INH   = 'inherit'     TP    = 'top'     BM    = 'bottom'     LT    = 'left'     RT    = 'right'       if       document.all         BROWSER = 'IE'     else if  window.opera         BROWSER = 'Opera'       40   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        else if  NavCheck 'Chrome'    BROWSER = 'Chrome'      else if  NavCheck 'iPod'      BROWSER = 'iPod'     else if  NavCheck 'iPhone'    BROWSER = 'iPhone'     else if  NavCheck 'iPad'      BROWSER = 'iPad'     else if  NavCheck 'Android'   BROWSER = 'Android'     else if  NavCheck 'Safari'    BROWSER = 'Safari'     else if  NavCheck 'Gecko'     BROWSER = 'Firefox'     else                          BROWSER = 'UNKNOWN'       document.onmousemove = CaptureMouse     document.onkeydown   = CaptureKeyboard     document.onkeypress  = CaptureKeyboard       document.onmouseout  = function   { MOUSE_IN   = false }     document.onmouseover = function   { MOUSE_IN   = true  }     document.onmouseup   = function   { MOUSE_DOWN = false }     document.onmousedown = function   { MOUSE_DOWN = true  }          function NavCheck check      {        return navigator.userAgent.indexOf check   != -1     }  }     4  CaptureMouse   This plug-in is called only by the Initialize   function, and you should not need to call  it yourself. What it does is attach to the mouse movement event, updating various global  variables with details about the mouse position, as shown in Figure 3-4.  About the Plug-in This plug-in attaches to the document.onmousemove event, updating the global variables  MOUSE_X, MOUSE_Y, SCROLL_X, and SCROLL_Y. The event passes the value e to it, which is  only used by browsers other than Internet Explorer. It does not require you to pass it any  arguments, nor does it return any values.     Figure 3-4  This plug-in lets  you know where  the mouse   pointer is.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     41  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  e  window.event  document. documentElement  window  MOUSE_X  MOUSE_Y  SCROLL_X  SCROLL_X  The event as passed to the function by browsers other than  Internet Explorer. e.pageX and e.pageY contain the X and Y  locations of the mouse pointer. Internet Explorer uses the window.event property instead of  an event passed as an argument. The clientX and clientY  subproperties contain the X and Y locations of the mouse pointer. If the browser is Internet Explorer then the scrollLeft  and scrollTop properties of this property are accessed to  determine the amount of horizontal and vertical scroll. On browsers other than Internet Explorer the pageXOffsett  and pageYOffset properties of window are accessed to  determine the amount of horizontal and vertical scroll. Global integer containing the current horizontal coordinate of the  mouse pointer Global integer containing the current vertical coordinate of the  mouse pointer. Global integer containing the amount the browser has been  scrolled vertically, in pixels. Global integer containing the amount the browser has been  scrolled vertically, in pixels.  How It Works This function traps the document.onmousemove event and accesses either the e value  passed to it in browsers other than Internet Explorer or, in Internet Explorer, it accesses the  global window.event property. Using these values it sets the values of the global variables  MOUSE_X and MOUSE_Y to the current X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer.  The scrollLeft and scrollTop properties of document.documentElement are also   accessed in Internet Explorer to determine the amount of any horizontal and vertical  scrolling. These values are placed in the global variables SCROLL_X and SCROLL_Y. In  browsers other than Internet Explorer, SCROLL_X and SCROLL_Y are given their values  based on the pageXOffset and pageYOffset properties of window.  The value true is then returned to allow the event to be acted on by the browser.  How To Use It You will not access this function directly. Instead, by calling the Initialize   plug-in as  recommended, the values needed to determine the X and Y locations of the mouse pointer  and any horizontal or scrolling values are placed in the global variables MOUSE_X, MOUSE_Y,  SCROLL_X, and SCROLL_Y and are kept constantly updated.  To illustrate how you can use these, the following code will display these values in    real time:       PaddingPaddingPaddingPaddingPaddingPaddingPaddingPaddingPaddingPadding         42   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        window.onload = function    {     setInterval simpleInterrupt, INTERVAL        function simpleInterrupt       {        O 'output' .innerHTML =            '  Mouse X,Y = ' + MOUSE_X  + ',' + MOUSE_Y +           ' Scroll X,Y = ' + SCROLL_X + ',' + SCROLL_Y     }  }     The first section is within the HTML body of a web page and is used to create a div into   which the output will be inserted. Underneath the div there’s a line of text made up from  repeating the word Padding. This is used to make the text overflow  since there are no  spaces in it , causing the bottom scrollbar to appear so you can move the scrollbar and see  the offset value change in real time. If your browser is set very wide, you should resize it  until the scrollbar appears.  In the   section there's a single main line of code that sets up a regular interrupt   using the setInterval   function, passing it the name of the function to call  which is  simpleInterrupt  and the frequency at which it should be called in INTERVAL  which   is 30 by default . This means the function simpleInterrupt   will be called up every   30 milliseconds.  tip  In JavaScript, whenever you wish to reference a function by its name without actually calling   the function, you omit the final opening and closing brackets. In this instance, the  setInterval   function knows that you are passing only the name of the function. If you  used opening and closing brackets, the function would first be called and the value it returned  would be passed to the setInterval   function, which is probably not what you want.  The simpleInterrupt   function uses the O   plug-in you have already seen to select   the div ‘output’ object by name. It then assigns the following string to that object’s  innerHTML property. This has the effect of inserting the string as if it were entered between  the opening and closing div tags. The value assigned is some text and the values in the four  global variables.  To try this for yourself, enter the example code  as well as entering the required initial   pair of   commands to load in the PJ.js file and calling the Initialize   plug-in ,  or select example04.htm from the plug-ins.zip file, which you can download from the  companion website at pluginjavascript.com.  Then resize your browser so that it is fairly small and the bottom scrollbar is visible.   Move the mouse about within the browser and move the scrollbar to see the values  displayed change in real time. Because of the way the scrolling event works, you will only  see its values change when you release the mouse button after moving one of the scrollbars.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     43  As you can see, with very little work you can look up important values associated with  the mouse whenever you need them. You also just saw the O   plug-in being used in a real  situation.  The Plug-in function CaptureMouse e   {     if  BROWSER == 'IE'      {        SCROLL_X = document.documentElement.scrollLeft        SCROLL_Y = document.documentElement.scrollTop        MOUSE_X  = window.event.clientX + SCROLL_X        MOUSE_Y  = window.event.clientY + SCROLL_Y     }     else     {        SCROLL_X = window.pageXOffset        SCROLL_Y = window.pageYOffset        MOUSE_X  = e.pageX        MOUSE_Y  = e.pageY     }       return true  }    5  CaptureKeyboard   This plug-in makes a note of any keypresses made and stores the result in the global  variable KEY_PRESS, as demonstrated by the example in Figure 3-5, which has detected the  Alt key being pressed.  About the Plug-in You will not need to call this plug-in yourself because it should already have been called by  the Initialize   plug-in. It doesn’t require any arguments and doesn’t return any that  you can use.     Figure 3-5  Determining which  keys have been  pressed is easy  with this plug-in.      44   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  e  window.event  BROWSER  KEY_PRESS  fromCharCode    FromKeyCode    The event as passed to the function by browsers other than Internet  Explorer. Either e.charCode or e.keyCode contains the value of  the key pressed. Internet Explorer uses the window.event property instead of an  event passed as an argument. The keyCode contains the value of  the key pressed. Global variable used to determine the browser. Global variable to be assigned the value of the keypress. JavaScript function to convert Unicode values to characters. Plug-in to return the value of a keypress or its name if it is one of  many special characters such as ‘Esc’, ‘Home’, and so on.  How It Works This function works differently depending on whether you are using Internet Explorer or  not. If you are, it looks up the keypress in window.event.keyCode and passes it through  the FromKeyCode   plug-in, which will assign a string if the keypress was a special one  such as ‘PgUp’, ‘Backspace’, and so on. Then, if the value is still a number  that is, it hasn’t  been substituted for a special key name , the JavaScript fromCharCode   function converts  it from its Unicode value to an actual key value, so that if, for example, the key e is pressed,  then the value ‘e’ is returned.  On non-Internet Explorer browsers, both e.charCode and e.keyCode are checked for    a value because both the events document.onkeydown and document.onkeypress are  captured by this function. One function captures regular keys, while the other handles the  special keys already referred to, so combining both into the same function makes sense. So,  if e.charCode has a value, it is passed through the JavaScript fromCharCode   function to  convert it from its Unicode value. Or, if e.keycode has a value, a special key was pressed,  so its value is passed through the FromKeyCode   plug-in to look the key name up.  In either case, the result is that KEY_PRESS will contain a letter, number, punctuation   symbol, the name of a special key, or simply a key number if it is none of the others. There is  no keyboard buffering to, for example, create strings of input, as only the last key pressed is  saved. However, it is quite possible to create an input function using this if you need one.  Finally, a value of true is returned to allow further processing of the event by the browser.  How To Use It Using this plug-in is as simple as referencing the global variable, KEY_PRESS, that it maintains.  The following is a simple example that continuously updates the contents of a div with the  value of the last key pressed:           window.onload = function    {     setInterval simpleInterrupt, INTERVAL          C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     45     function simpleInterrupt       {        O 'output' .innerHTML = ' You pressed: ' + KEY_PRESS     }  }     Again  and I won’t mention this any more , this assumes you have already included the   lines to load in PJ.js and called the Initialize   function.  The interrupt is set up so that the value of the last keypress can be continuously displayed.   If you prefer, you can always use a command such as the following in the loop instead:  alert 'You pressed: ' + KEY_PRESS   However, it is intrusive, and you have to click the OK button to close the alert each time   it is called. What’s more, it locks up the browser because the alert   function prevents  you from doing anything else  even closing the browser  until you have clicked OK, and  even then the alert will pop up again, and again, forever.   tip  Because of the problem of alert   potentially taking over a browser if placed within a loop,   this book includes an alternate function called Alert    with an upper case A  which you may  prefer to use. It does not lock the browser and has other benefits too. For further details, please  refer to Chapter 13.  The Plug-in  function CaptureKeyboard e   {     if  BROWSER == 'IE'      {        KEY_PRESS = FromKeyCode window.event.keyCode           if  KEY_PRESS > 0            KEY_PRESS = String.fromCharCode KEY_PRESS      }     else     {        if  e.charCode      KEY_PRESS = String.fromCharCode e.charCode         else if  e.keyCode  KEY_PRESS = FromKeyCode e.keyCode      }          return true  }    6  FromKeyCode   This plug-in returns the name of the key pressed if it is a special one such as ‘Ctrl’ or ‘Alt’;  otherwise, the value passed to it is returned, as shown in Figure 3-6, in which the  translations for key codes 1 through 144 are displayed.      46   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 3-6  This plug-in returns  meaningful names  for key codes.  About the Plug-in This plug in takes a key code as an argument and returns either a string representing the  special key that was pressed, or the code if no such key was pressed.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  c  Key code passed to the function and returned by it if it does not  represent a special key  How It Works This function uses a switch   statement to test the value of c and return various strings if  it matches set values. If none of the values match, then c is returned.  How To Use It Generally this plug-in will be called for you by the CaptureKeyboard   plug-in.  However, you may have an application for which you’d rather not return the strings  given, or you’d rather return different names. In these cases, feel free to modify the plug-in  to your requirements.  For example, if you don’t want the keypresses created by pressing the shift key, you   might prefer to return a value of the empty string for that value instead of the string ‘shift’.  That way, when the user presses the shift key followed by the m key, for example, you will  only see the value ‘m’ and not ‘shift’ followed by ‘m’.  The reason I’ve gone to the bother of trapping these special keys is that, although there   are already useful input features built into JavaScript, these plug-ins allow you to, for example,  set up various special keys to move objects around the screen or perform particular functions  the moment a key is pressed.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     47  Here’s a combined HTML and JavaScript example to return the translations for codes 1   through 144:           window.onload = function    {     for  j = 1 ; j < 145 ; ++j      O 'output' .innerHTML += FromKeyCode j  + ', '  }     An interesting point to note here is the use of the += operator to keep appending to the   contents of the innerHTML property of the ‘output’ div.  The Plug-in function FromKeyCode c   {     switch  c      {        case   8: return 'Backspace'        case   9: return 'Tab'        case  12: return 'Center'        case  13: return 'Enter'        case  16: return 'Shift'        case  17: return 'Control'        case  18: return 'Alt'        case  19: return 'Pause'        case  20: return 'Capslock'        case  27: return 'Esc'        case  33: return 'PgUp'        case  34: return 'PgDn'        case  35: return 'End'        case  36: return 'Home'        case  37: return 'left'        case  38: return 'Up'        case  39: return 'Right'        case  40: return 'Down'        case  45: return 'Ins'        case  46: return 'Del'        case  91: return 'Windows'        case  93: return 'Menu'        case 144: return 'Numlock'     }       return c  }      48   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       7  GetLastKey   This plug-in returns the value of whatever the last keypress was and then resets the stored  value to the empty string to indicate that the key value has been retrieved. Figure 3-7 shows  a simple input function created using this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in doesn’t take any arguments and returns the value of the most recently pressed  key  if any .  Variables, Arrays, and Functions k  Local string variable that holds the value of KEY_PRESS  before resetting it and returning k  How It Works This plug-in assigns the value in KEY_PRESS, the global variable that contains the last key  pressed, to the local variable k. Then it resets KEY_PRESS to the empty string to show that  the value has been read. Finally, the contents of k is returned. If there was no keypress, the  empty string is returned.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, call it with no arguments and it will return either a letter, number,  punctuation symbol, or a special key name. If the key was none of these, then its code is  returned.  You can use this plug-in to create a very simple input function, like this:  What is your name?            window.onload = function    {     input 'name'        function input id      {        var interrupt = setInterval simpleInterrupt, INTERVAL         Figure 3-7  This plug-in can  build an input  function.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     49        function simpleInterrupt          {           var k = GetLastKey               if  k == 'Enter'            {              k = '.'              clearInterval interrupt            }           O id .innerHTML += k        }     }  }     To make this work, a span is created in which the input will be placed. Then the JavaScript  code makes a call to a new function called input  , passing the ID of the span. The input    function then sets up a repeating interrupt using setInterval   to the subfunction  simpleInterrupt  .  The simpleInterrupt   function then calls GetLastKey   each time it is called. If the  value is ever ‘Enter’, it means the user has pressed the Enter key and k is assigned the value  ‘.’  a period , and the interrupt is disabled using clearInterval  , with the interrupt ID  previously assigned to interrupt.  Finally, the innerHTML property of the object indicated by id has the latest key value   returned appended to it. If the value is the empty string, then nothing is appended.  All your code has to do then is look at the end of the string to see if it is the period   character to indicate that the user has pressed Enter. Your code then removes that character  and uses the remainder of the string. Alternatively, you can use a different end of input  marker. Whatever you do, if you want to create your own input routine rather than use a  ready-made one such as an   tag, you have to go through all these  swings and roundabouts of interrupt driven calls, because that’s the way JavaScript works.  However, at least you now have a way of doing so when you need it.  For a bit of fun, if you store the input somewhere hidden rather than in a span, you can   check for a sequence of characters to be entered—much like entering cheat codes into a  game—and if a recognizable sequence is entered, you can trigger a bonus feature.  The Plug-in function GetLastKey    {     var k = KEY_PRESS     KEY_PRESS = ''     return k  }    8  PreventAction   This plug-in is for preventing an object’s drag or select event  or both  from occurring. For  example, sometimes you may wish to prevent a section of text from being copied, or at least  from being highlighted, and you can easily do that with this plug-in. Figure 3-8 shows one       50   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 3-8  The image and the  second sentence  cannot be dragged  or selected.  section of text that is being selected, while the second sentence is not selectable. The GIF  image is also undraggable.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes three arguments and, depending on their values, either prevents or  enables certain events to occur. The arguments are as follows:   	 id  The ID of an object, such as a div or span section of HTML, a GIF image, or any   other object   	 type  This argument can have one of three string values: ‘drag’, ‘select’, or ‘both’.  If the value is ‘drag’, then the object referred to by id will either be prevented from  being dragged or allowed to be dragged, depending on the value of onoff. If it is  ‘select’, then the selection of text will be either prevented or allowed, depending on  the value of onoff. If it is ‘both’, then both these events will be either prevented or  allowed.   	 onoff  This argument should be either true or false; alternatively, the values 1  or 0 are acceptable. The values true or 1 mean the event  or events  in the variable  type are prevented. If onoff is false or 0 then the event  or events  are allowed.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  ondragstart  onselectstart  onmousedown  MozUserSelect  Event of the object passed in id Event of the object passed in id Event of the object passed in id Property of the object passed in id  only used by Mozilla-based  browsers such as Firefox   How It Works The plug-in code is divided into two main sections. In the first, the drag event of the object  referenced by id is managed, while the second half is for handling the id object’s select  event. Each of these halves is again split into two parts. In the first half of each, the events it  handles are prevented, while the second half is for re-enabling an event after it has been  disabled.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     51  To provide these features, if the browser supports it, either the ondragstart or   onselectstart event of the object in id  or both events if the value in type is ‘both’  is  assigned an inline, anonymous function that returns the value false, which has the effect  of cancelling any further action.  If the event is not recognized, then the onmousedown event for the object in id is caught and  set to return false. This is not that great a solution because it prevents other onmousedown  events from being attached, but it does have the effect of preventing the event from occurring. In the case of Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox, the special property MozUserSelect   is set to either ‘none’ to prevent text from being selected, or ‘text’ to re-enable it. This is  necessary because these browsers will not use the onselectstart event, and using this  property is less intrusive than capturing the onmousedown event.  How To Use It To prevent the copying and pasting of the contents of a div, for example, you can attach this  function to its onselectstart event, like this:  PreventAction 'mydiv', 'select', true   If a user tries to select any text, this plug-in stops the event before it can get going. This   is not merely a relatively easy way to prevent people from copying text from your web  pages, it also helps prevent text from being inadvertently highlighted when you are using  the mouse to drag items about.  You can also use it in to prevent an object from being dragged in the browser or dragged   and dropped elsewhere, like this:  PreventAction 'mygif', 'drag', true   Here’s some code that illustrates both of these uses:     The image cannot be dragged.   And this text is unselectable        window.onload = function    {     PreventAction 'gif',  'drag',   true      PreventAction 'text', 'select', true   }     In the HTML section of the example, a GIF image with the name i1.gif is displayed and  given the ID of ‘gif’. This is followed by some regular text and a span with the ID of ‘text’.  Below that, in the   section, the GIF image has its drag property disabled, and  the span text is made unselectable. If you try either of these actions they will fail. However,  Internet Explorer will allow you to continue the selection within the span if you commence  a select action from outside the span. You can work around this bug by setting the whole  document as unselectable, like this:  PreventAction document.body, 'select', true       52   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     However, this means that nothing at all on your web page can be selected. Other   browsers do not have this bug.  The Plug-in function PreventAction id, type, onoff   {     if  type == 'drag'  type == 'both'      {        if  onoff == true         {           if  typeof O id .ondragstart != UNDEF               O id .ondragstart   = function   { return false }           else O id .onmousedown = function   { return false }        }        else        {           if  typeof O id .ondragstart != UNDEF                 O id .ondragstart = ''           else O id .onmousedown = ''        }     }       if  type == 'select'  type == 'both'      {        if  onoff == true         {           if  typeof O id .onselectstart != UNDEF               O id .onselectstart = function   { return false }           else if  typeof S id .MozUserSelect != UNDEF               S id .MozUserSelect = 'none'           else O id .onmousedown = function   { return false }        }        else        {           if  typeof O id .onselectstart != UNDEF               O id .onselectstart = ''           else if  typeof S id .MozUserSelect != UNDEF               S id .MozUserSelect = 'text'           else O id .onmousedown = ''        }     }  }    9  NoPx   and Px   These plug-ins are short but powerful functions that provide opposing functionality.  NoPx   removes the ‘px’ suffix attached to some CSS properties, while Px   attaches the  ‘px’ suffix to a property. Figure 3-9 shows the plug-ins in use.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     53     Figure 3-9  These plug-ins  make it easier to  work in values of  pixels.  About the Plug-ins These plug-ins require an object’s property to be passed to them. If NoPx   is passed a  value, then the value returned will be that of the value less any ‘px’ suffix. If Px   is called,  then the value returned is that of the value passed to the plug-in, combined with the suffix  ‘px’. In no case is any property actually changed by these plug-ins, as values are merely  derived based on the properties, and it is up to you to use them as required. The plug-ins  require the following argument:   	 value  The property to be modified  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  replace    JavaScript function for replacing a subsection of a string  How They Work The NoPx   function uses the JavaScript replace   function to replace any occurrences of  ‘px’ in the string it is passed, and then returns the result, multiplied by 1 to ensure it is  turned from a string into a number.  The Px   function adds the suffix ‘px’ to any value it is passed and then returns the result.  How To Use Them The NoPx   function is very simple in that all it does is replace the substring ‘px’  if found   with the empty string in any string it is passed. Thus it can strip away the trailing ‘px’ suffix  that many object properties have. For example, the style.marginLeft property is just one  of many that end in ‘px’, so the following call will strip it out:  value = NoPx S id .marginLeft   In this example the object referred to by id is passed to the S   function, which returns   the style subobject. The marginLeft property is then appended to this and the resulting  string value, which might look like ‘10px’, for example, is then passed to the NoPx   function.  In this case, it would return the number 10, which is then assigned to the variable value.      54   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Px   function performs the inverse, adding the ‘px’ suffix to a value. This is useful  when you need to assign ‘px’ to an object’s property that needs to know you are working in  pixels. For example, the style.width property can be used to set the width of an object,  but it needs to have ‘px’ added to it. To save you having to do this you can make the  following call instead:  S id .left = Px 135   This command uses the S   function to set the width of the object referred to by id to   135 pixels, since Px 135  evaluates to the string ‘135px’.  Here’s an example of how you might use these plug-ins:   I'm a square        window.onload = function    {     S 'square' .width           = Px 100      S 'square' .height          = Px 100      S 'square' .backgroundColor = 'yellow'       alert "The value returned for the width of 'square' is: "   +        S 'square' .width + '\nAfter using NoPx   this becomes ' +        NoPx S 'square' .width    }     The HTML section contains a single div element with some text. In the     section the div is resized to become 100 pixels wide by 100 high, using the Px   function to  create the values. The background is also set to yellow so you can see the square.  After this there’s a call to the JavaScript alert   function in which the value of the   object’s width style property is displayed  ‘100px’ , and that value is passed through the  NoPx   function and redisplayed. This time it’s the number 100.  The Plug-ins function NoPx value   {     return value.replace  px , ''  * 1  }  function Px value   {     return value + 'px'  }    10  X   and Y   This pair of similar functions returns an object’s exact horizontal or vertical offset from the left  or top of the browser. The plug-in names are so short because they are used very frequently  and it saves on typing; it also makes your source code easier to follow. In Figure 3-10 you can  see that the left and top edges of the div are inset from the browser edge by 8 pixels.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     55  Figure 3-10    Looking up the  absolute horizontal  and vertical offsets  of an object  About the Plug-ins These plug-ins return the absolute horizontal or vertical offsets of an object from the left or  top of the browser window. They take this argument:   	 id  The object whose offset is to be returned  Variables, Arrays, and Functions obj  offset  offsetParent  offsetLeft  offsetTop  Local object copy of the id object Local integer used to hold the horizontal or vertical offset The parent offset object The object’s left offset The object’s top offset  How They Work These plug-ins first make a copy of the object represented by id in obj and set the local  variable offset to either the offsetLeft or offsetTop property of the object. This is the  amount by which the object is offset from its parent.  Then, in case the parent object is also a subobject, the if   and while   statements  recurse back through all parent objects, adding their offsets in turn to offset, until there  are no more parent objects. At this point offset contains the absolute distance in pixels  from the left side or top edge of the browser window to the left or top of the object. This  value is then returned.  How To Use Them To use these plug-ins, pass the ID of an object to them and they will return either the  absolute horizontal or absolute vertical position of its left side or top edge in pixels. Here’s  some code to illustrate their use:   I'm a square             56   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     window.onload = function    {     S 'square' .width           = Px 100      S 'square' .height          = Px 100      S 'square' .backgroundColor = 'yellow'     alert "The object 'square' is at position " +        X 'square'  + ',' + Y 'square'    }     This example is similar to the previous one in that it creates a square div with the ID  ‘square’, but in this example the object’s absolute left and top offsets are returned by the  alert   statement, with calls to X   and Y  .  The Plug-ins function X id   {     var obj    = O id      var offset = obj.offsetLeft       if  obj.offsetParent         while obj = obj.offsetParent            offset += obj.offsetLeft       return offset  }  function Y id   {     var obj    = O id      var offset = obj.offsetTop       if  obj.offsetParent         while obj = obj.offsetParent            offset += obj.offsetTop       return offset  }    11  W   and H   In addition to needing to know the location of an object, as in the previous pair of plug-ins,  you often need to know their width and height, which you can determine with these  functions. Figure 3-11 shows the plug-ins being used to discover an object’s width   and height.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     57     Figure 3-11  Determining the  width and height of  an object  About the Plug-ins These plug-ins return an object’s exact width or height, including any margins and borders.  They require the following argument:   	 id  The object whose dimensions are to be returned  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  offsetWidth  offsetHeight  marginLeft  marginRight  marginTop  marginBottom  borderLeft  borderRight  borderTopWidth  borderBottomWidth  border  NoPx    The object’s width The object’s height The object’s left margin width The objects’ right margin width The object’s top margin width The object’s bottom margin width The object’s left border width The object’s right border width The object’s top border width The object’s bottom border width The image object’s border property The plug-in to remove ‘px’ suffixes  How They Work Each function adds together all the properties that affect either an object’s width or its  height. To return the width of an object, its offsetWidth is added to its  marginLeft and  marginRight properties, like this:  var width = O id .offsetWidth +              NoPx S id .marginLeft  +              NoPx S id .marginRight       58   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Next, a check is made of its borderLeftWidth and borderRightWidth properties by  adding the two values together to obtain their sum. If the result is greater than 0, then that  amount is placed in the variable bord. Here is that code section:  var bord = NoPx S id .borderLeftWidth  +             NoPx S id .borderRightWidth   Next, because an object’s border style property overrides an image’s border property  even   though the border image property retains its value , if bord has a value it is subtracted from  the value to be returned. If it doesn’t have a value, then the object’s image border property  value, multiplied by two  once for the left and once for the right border , is subtracted from the  value to be returned. This is because the offsetWidth property already includes the widths of  any borders, so they are taken off so as to return only the object and its margin’s width. Here is  the code for this section:  if  bord > 0            width -= bord  else  if  O id .border  width -= O id .border * 2  return width  An object’s padding width is not returned because none of the plug-ins need to know   this value.  To return the height of an object, the same process is used in the H   plug-in, with    the properties offsetHeight, marginTop, marginBottom, borderTopWidth,  borderBottomWidth, and border.  In either case the calculated value is returned.  CautioN  If you add together the H   heights of two vertically adjacent boxes  perhaps in order to  specify the height of a containing div , if there are margins, the calculated height will be greater  than the height the browser actually uses to render both boxes on top of each other, due to vertical  margin collapsing, in which only the largest of the two margins is used.  How To Use Them To use these plug-ins, pass them the ID of an object whose dimensions you need. Here’s  some code showing how you might use them:   I'm a square        window.onload = function    {     S 'square' .width           = Px 100      S 'square' .height          = Px 100      S 'square' .backgroundColor = 'yellow'       alert "The object 'square' is " +        W 'square'  + ' by ' + H 'square'  + ' pixels.'   }         C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     59  This example is quite similar to previous ones in that the div called ‘square’ is created in  the HTML section. The difference here is that the alert   function displays the width and  height of the object using the W   and H   plug-ins.  Note  You may find it interesting to note the use of all the S  , W  , H   and NoPx   plug-ins  here. Already you can see how these plug-ins are coming together to make your programming  much easier. Without the earlier functions to build on, these plug-ins might be two or three times  the size, but this way they only use a handful of characters, such as W 'obj' . Once you get a  little further into the book, even more powerful functions will become available to you that would  take dozens, if not hundreds, of lines of code to write from scratch.  The Plug-ins function W id   {     var width   = O id .offsetWidth +                   NoPx S id .marginLeft  +                   NoPx S id .marginRight        var bord    = NoPx S id .borderLeftWidth  +                   NoPx S id .borderRightWidth        if  bord > 0           width -= bord     else if  O id .border  width -= O id .border * 2       return width  }  function H id   {     var height  = O id .offsetHeight +                   NoPx S id .marginTop  +                   NoPx S id .marginBottom        var bord    = NoPx S id .borderTopWidth  +                   NoPx S id .borderBottomWidth        if  bord > 0          height -= bord     else if O id .border  height -= O id .border * 2       return height  }    12  Html   Because you will frequently find yourself needing to write to the innerHTML property of  objects, I wrote this simple plug-in to keep the code short and improve its readability, as  shown in Figure 3-12.      60   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 3-12  This plug-in makes  it easy to read and  write the HTML  contents of an  object.  About the Plug-in This plug-in returns the innerHTML property of the object it is passed. You can use it to  either read or write this property. Only the first argument is required to read a value, but  both are required to write one:   	 id  The ID of the object with the innerHTML property to access  	 value  The value to assign to the innerHTML property  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  innerHTML  The property containing the HTML text of an object  How It Works To read a value, the plug-in uses the O   plug-in to reference the object in id and return its  innerHTML property. To write a value, you pass a second argument, value, to the plug-in.  If the code notices that this argument has been passed, the innerHTML property of id is  changed to value. In either case the value of the innerHTML property is returned.  How To Use It You can either read or write to the innerHTML property of an object that supports it using  this function. To write to it you use a statement such as this:  Html 'mydiv', 'This is some new text'   To read from the property, you use a statement such as this:  var contents = Html 'mydiv'   Here’s some code that uses a couple of alert   calls so you can see the before and after   effects of using the plug-in:    This is a heading              C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     61  window.onload = function    {     alert Html 'heading'       Html 'heading', ' This is a subheading '      alert Html 'heading'    }     The first section of HTML creates a div with an   heading. Then the     section immediately pops up an alert showing this value by using a call to Html  . After  that, the value of the object’s innerHTML property is changed to a subheading, again using  Html  , and then a second call to the JavaScript alert   function redisplays the property,  using the Html   function—at which time you will see that the contents has changed.  The Plug-in  function Html id, value   {     if  typeof value != UNDEF         O id .innerHTML = value     return O id .innerHTML  }    13  SaveState   After you change the properties for an object, there are times when you might want to  restore it to its original state. This plug-in allows you to back up all the most important style  properties of an object. Figure 3-13 shows a div being prepared with a few values prior to  testing the SaveState   plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in backs up several of the most important style properties of an object, where they  can be later retrieved should you need them. It takes the following argument:   	 id  The object whose properties are to be backed up     Figure 3-13  Creating a div with  which to test  saving and  restoring states      62   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  left  top  visibility  color  backgroundColor  display  opacity  MozOpacity  KhtmlOpacity  filter  zIndex  The object’s style.left property The object’s style.top property The object’s style.visibility property The object’s style.color property The object’s style.backgroundColor property The object’s style.display property The object’s style.opacity property The object’s style.MozOpacity property The object’s style.KhtmlOpacity property The object’s style.filter property The object’s style.zIndex property  How It Works This is a very simple plug-in that creates backup properties for each of the properties. Each  new backup property name begins with the string “Save_”, and ends with the original  property name. The ones you may not know are MozOpacity, which is the opacity  property used by Mozilla based browsers such as Firefox, and KhtmlOpacity, which is  used by older versions of the Apple Safari browser.  How To Use It To create a set of backup properties for an object, pass its ID to the SaveState   plug-in,  like this:  The following code shows a few style settings being made to an object and then its state   SaveState 'myobject'   being saved:   Example Text        window.onload = function    {     S 'mydiv' .width           = Px 200      S 'mydiv' .height          = Px 100      S 'mydiv' .backgroundColor = 'green'     S 'mydiv' .color           = 'white'     S 'mydiv' .position        = 'absolute'       SaveState 'mydiv'   }         C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     63  This creates a green, 200 by 100-pixel rectangle with white text whose position is   absolute  and the object is therefore movable . In the next plug-in, you’ll see what happens  if these values are changed and the saved state is restored.  The Plug-in function SaveState id   {     O id .Save_left            = S id .left     O id .Save_top             = S id .top     O id .Save_visibility      = S id .visibility     O id .Save_color           = S id .color     O id .Save_backgroundColor = S id .backgroundColor     O id .Save_display         = S id .display     O id .Save_opacity         = S id .opacity     O id .Save_MozOpacity      = S id .MozOpacity     O id .Save_KhtmlOpacity    = S id .KhtmlOpacity     O id .Save_filter          = S id .filter     O id .Save_zIndex          = S id .zIndex  }    14  RestoreState   This is the partner plug-in for SaveState  . It will restore an object’s major style settings to  the way they were when they were saved. Figure 3-14 shows that the div created in the  previous plug-in has been modified; its colors are different and it has been moved to the  right. An alert box has popped up to let you see this before the RestoreState   plug-in is  called to restore the div to its original state.  About the Plug-in This plug-in restores the style properties that have been saved using the SaveState    plug-in. It takes this argument:   	 id  The object whose style properties are to be restored     Figure 3-14  The SaveState    and RestoreState    plug-ins in action      64   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  left  top  visibility  color  backgroundColor  display  opacity  MozOpacity  KhtmlOpacity  filter  zIndex  The object’s style.left property The object’s style.top property The object’s style.visibility property The object’s style.color property The object’s style.backgroundColor property The object’s style.display property The object’s style.opacity property The object’s style.MozOpacity property The object’s style.KhtmlOpacity property The object’s style.filter property The object’s style.zIndex property  How It Works This plug-in reverses the action of the SaveState   plug-in by retrieving the values saved  in the properties, beginning with  the string ‘Save_’, and restoring them. If there are any  additional properties you need to save and restore, they are very easy to add to these  functions.  How To Use It To use it, just pass this plug-in the ID of an object whose state has already been saved,   like this:  RestoreState 'myobject'   The following example extends the previous plug-in to both create a div and then   change it twice, the first time by modifying a few of its style properties and the second to  change it back by calling RestoreState  . In between, the JavaScript alert   function is  called to give you a chance to view the screen before moving on:   Example Text        window.onload = function    {     S 'mydiv' .width           = Px 200      S 'mydiv' .height          = Px 100      S 'mydiv' .backgroundColor = 'green'     S 'mydiv' .color           = 'white'     S 'mydiv' .position        = 'absolute'       SaveState 'mydiv'        alert 'Click OK to see some changes'          C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     65     S 'mydiv' .backgroundColor = 'blue'     S 'mydiv' .color           = 'yellow'     S 'mydiv' .left            = Px 100        alert 'Click OK to see them change back again'        RestoreState 'mydiv'   }     If you enter this example into your browser, the div will start off as white text on green,   then it will change to yellow on blue and move to the right, and finally it will return to its  original colors and position, all with a single call to RestoreState  .  The Plug-in function RestoreState id   {     S id .left            = O id .Save_left     S id .top             = O id .Save_top     S id .visibility      = O id .Save_visibility     S id .color           = O id .Save_color     S id .backgroundColor = O id .Save_backgroundColor     S id .display         = O id .Save_display     S id .opacity         = O id .Save_opacity     S id .MozOpacity      = O id .Save_MozOpacity     S id .KhtmlOpacity    = O id .Save_KhtmlOpacity     S id .filter          = O id .Save_filter     S id .zIndex          = O id .Save_zIndex  }    15  InsVars   In JavaScript, when you want to create a string of text that also includes the values of  different variables, you have to keep closing the string, then use a + sign followed by the  variable name, follow it with another +, and then re-open the string—and you have to do  this for every single variable. However, this plug-in lets you easily drop the values of  variables into any string. Figure 3-15 shows three values being inserted in this manner.  About the Plug-in This plug-in requires at least two arguments. The first is the string in which to insert various  values, and the second, third, and so on, are the values to be inserted, as follows:   	 string  The string in which to insert values  	 value1  A value to insert in string  	 value2  As value1  etc…       66   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 3-15  This plug-in makes  it easy to insert  values into strings.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  tmp  arguments  replace    regExp    Local variable containing the string to process Array of arguments passed to the plug-in JavaScript function to replace substrings in a string JavaScript function to create a regular expression  How It Works This plug-in makes use of the handy fact that JavaScript passes an array to every function  that is called. This array is called arguments, and each element of it is one of the values that  has been passed to the function.  Therefore, the first element is extracted and placed in tmp, a local variable. This is the   string in which to make the variable substitutions, like this:  var tmp = arguments[0]  Then a for   loop is used to iterate through each remaining element. If there is a   substring with the value ‘1’ within the string tmp, the first value is inserted in its place. The  same happens for ‘2’, ‘3’, and any number of similar substrings, with each being replaced  by the next in line of the values passed to the plug-in, like this:  tmp = tmp.replace new RegExp '' + j, 'g' , arguments[j]   To allow one value to be inserted in many places in a string, a global replace is enabled  by using the RegExp   object to create a new regular expression with the value ‘g’ supplied  to indicate a global search and or replace.  Finally, the modified tmp string is returned.  How To Use It To insert values into a string using InsVars  , you call it up in the following manner:  string = InsVars 'The product of 1 and 2 is 3', 6, 7, 6 * 7       C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     67  This statement will assign the value “The product of 6 and 7 is 42” to string. All you  have to remember is to use the same number of ‘?’ tags as there are values to be inserted.  The Plug-in  function InsVars    {     var tmp = arguments[0]       for  var j = 1 ; j < arguments.length ; ++j         tmp = tmp.replace new RegExp '' + j, 'g' , arguments[j]      return tmp  }    16  StrRepeat   Unlike many other languages, JavaScript doesn’t come with a function to create a new  string from a repeated substring. So here’s a plug-in to do the job, as shown in Figure 3-16,  in which a cheer is repeated three times.  About the Plug-in This plug-in creates a repeated string based on a string and a number. It takes these  arguments:   	 str  A string to repeat  	 num  The number of times to repeat the string  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  tmp  j  Local string variable used to store the string as it is assembled Local integer variable used for looping     Figure 3-16  Using this plug-in  to create a cheer.      68   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How It Works The plug-in uses a for   loop to assemble a final string created from num copies of str,  and then returns the new string.  How To Use It To use this function, pass it a string and a number, like this:  string = 'Three cheers for the winner. ' +     StrRepeat 'Hip, Hip Hooray', 3   alert string   This code places the repeated cheer into string and then displays it using a call to the   JavaScript alert   function.  The Plug-in function StrRepeat str, num   {     var tmp = ''       for  var j = 0 ; j < num ; ++j         tmp += str       return tmp  }     Figure 3-17  Converting a  number from  hexadecimal to  decimal    17  HexDec   The final two plug-ins in this chapter are to do with handling hexadecimal numbers,  something you have to do quite often in JavaScript, particularly when managing colors.  This one converts a hexadecimal number into decimal, as shown by Figure 3-17.      C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     69  About the Plug-in This plug-in requires a hexadecimal string to be passed to it, and it then returns that  number in decimal. It requires this argument:   	 n  A string containing a hexadecimal number  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  parseInt    JavaScript function to convert a string to a number  How It Works This plug-in uses the JavaScript function parseInt   to convert a hexadecimal string to   a decimal number. It does this because the second parameter passed to it is 16. If the second  number were 8, for example, it would try to convert from an octal number, and so on.  How To Use It Pass the HexDec   function any string containing a hexadecimal number and it will return  decimal number, like this:  alert 'The hexadecimal number FFFF in decimal is ' +     HexDec 'FFFF'    In this instance the hexadecimal number FFFF is converted to 65,535 in decimal, and the   result is displayed using a call to the JavaScript alert   function.    18  DecHex   This plug-in takes a decimal number and turns it into a hexadecimal string, as shown in  Figure 3-18.  The Plug-in function HexDec n   {     return parseInt n, 16    }     Figure 3-18  Converting a  number from  decimal to  hexadecimal      70   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in requires a decimal number to be passed to it, and it then returns that number  in the form of a hexadecimal string. It requires this argument:   	 n  A decimal number to be converted into hexadecimal  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  to.String    JavaScript function for converting a number to a string  How It Works This plug-in uses two code segments combined into a single statement. The first segment  looks like this:  n < 16 ? '0' : ''  This is known as a ternary expression, in which n < 16 is an initial test. The ? symbol  then indicates that if the result of the test is true then the value immediately following the ?  should be returned. Otherwise the value following the : should be returned. In this example,  that means that values of n that are lower than 16 will result in the string '0' being returned,  while values of n that are 16 and above result in ' ' being returned.  The reason for this is that this plug-in will mostly be used by code that wants to create   color triplets for setting a color. These triplets are made up of three groups of two hexadecimal  characters, like these: FF0088, 112233,  CCCCCC, and so on.  Each of these stands for hexadecimal FF  256 decimal  shades of the colors red green   and blue. For example, FF0088 means the intensity values for the given color should be FF  red, 00 green and 88 blue, in hexadecimal. Therefore, going back to the code segment, if n is  less than 16 it becomes a single digit in hexadecimal  a number between 0 and F , and in  such cases a leading 0 is added to pad the number up to the required two digits.  Having padded the number with a 0  if necessary , the number n is then passed to the   JavaScript toString   function with an argument of 16, like this code segment:  n.toString 16    This tells it to convert the number to base 16, which is hexadecimal. The results of the   two segments are then concatenated and returned. When you put both pieces of code  together they look like this:  return  n < 16 ? '0' : ''  + n.toString 16   How To Use It To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, pass it to the DecHex   plug-in, like this:  alert 'The decimal number 173 in hexadecimal is ' + DecHex 173        C h a p t e r   3 :   th e   C o r e  pl u g - i n s     71  The value displayed by this statement is ‘ad’, which is an acceptable hexadecimal   number for JavaScript when used as part of a color, so there’s usually no need to convert it  to uppercase or add any prefix to it.  This now completes the fundamentals of your basic JavaScript toolkit and, of necessity,   it’s one of the longest chapters in the book. In the next chapter, we’ll start adding plug-ins to  provide location and positioning features, and then the fun will really start.  The Plug-in function DecHex n   {     return  n < 16 ? '0' : ''  + n.toString 16   }   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 4  Location and Dimensions      74   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The previous chapter concentrated on providing a basic subset of core functionality.   This one does the same, but there are enough plug-ins in the collection now that we    can also start to create some interesting effects, including resizing and repositioning   objects.    19  ResizeWidth   When creating dynamic web pages you will often need to change the dimensions of objects.  You might do this to emphasize a section by enlarging it, you may allow the contents of a  page to be rearranged by the user, or you might wish to open up elements such as forms or  light boxes, and so forth.  With this plug-in, you can resize the width of any object that has a width property, such   as the example div shown in Figure 4-1, which has had its width resized to 300 pixels.  About the Plug-in This plug-in changes the width of an object. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  The ID of an object or the object itself. You can also pass an array of objects    	 width  The new width for the object. If id is an array, all the objects referred to are   and or object IDs.  set to this width.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  overflow  width  HID  Px    Local integer loop variable The object’s style.overflow property The object’s style.width property Global string variable with the value 'hidden' Plug-in to add the suffix ‘px’  How It Works This plug-in also offers the multifunctionality of the O   and S   plug-ins, in which you  can pass either the ID of an object or the object itself, and you can even pass an array of IDs  and or objects to change them all at the same time.  Figure 4-1  Resizing the width of an object      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    75  It achieves this by taking advantage of the fact that the S   plug-in is already set up to  deal with an object ID, an object, or an array of objects and or object IDs. Therefore, all that  is necessary is to call S   twice; once to set the object’s or array of objects’ style.overflow  properties to ‘hidden’, and then to set the style.width properties to the value in width.  The variable HID is a global variable created by the Initialize   plug-in, and it has  the value ‘hidden’. The style.overflow property of the object is set to this value to allow  objects to be reduced as well as enlarged and, when reduced, text that would have  overflowed is simply ignored.  Here’s an example you can try that resets the width of the div to 300 pixels. It also   changes the text and background colors so that you can see the change:  How To Use It To use this plug-in pass it an object and a width, like this:  ResizeWidth 'mydiv', 200   Or you can pass an array of objects, like this:  ids = Array 'objone', 'objtwo', 'objthree'   ResizeWidth ids, 480    Example div        window.onload = function    {     S 'example' .backgroundColor = 'blue'     S 'example' .color           = 'yellow'     ResizeWidth 'example', 300   }     The Plug-in function ResizeWidth id, width   {     S id, 'overflow', HID      S id, 'width',    Px width    }     20  ResizeHeight   In the same way that you may need to resize the width of an object, here’s a plug-in to  resize its height. Figure 4-2 shows the div created in the previous plug-in now increased in  height to 100 pixels.      76   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 4-2  Resizing the height of an object  About the Plug-in This plug-in changes the height of an object. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  The ID of an object or the object itself. You can also pass an array of objects    	 height  The new height for the object. If id is an array, all the objects referred to   and or object IDs.  are set to this height.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  overflow  height  HID  Px    Local integer loop variable The object’s style.overflow property The object’s style.height property Global string variable with the value 'hidden' Plug-in to add the suffix ‘px’  How It Works This is the companion plug-in to ResizeWidth  , and it works in exactly the same manner  as the previous one, with the only difference being that the object’s style.height property  is modified instead of style.width.  As with ResizeWidth  , you can pass either object IDs or objects, and you can also  pass an array of IDs and or objects. For further details on how this plug-in works, please  refer to the ResizeWidth   plug-in.  How To Use It To use this plug-in pass it an object and a height, like this:  ResizeHeight 'mydiv', 100       C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    77  Or you can pass an array of objects, like this:  ids = Array 'objone', 'objtwo', 'objthree'   ResizeHeight ids, 240   Here’s an example you can try that modifies the example in the previous plug-in by   resizing the div to 100 pixels in height:   Example div        window.onload = function    {     S 'example' .backgroundColor = 'blue'     S 'example' .color           = 'yellow'     ResizeWidth 'example',  300      ResizeHeight 'example', 100   }     The Plug-in function ResizeHeight id, height   {     S id, 'overflow', HID      S id, 'height',   Px height    }     21  Resize   This simple plug-in combines the previous two into a single function to save on typing and  to make your code more compact. With it you can change both the width and height of an  object or array of objects, as shown in Figure 4-3.  Figure 4-3  Resizing both the width and the height of an object      78   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in changes the width and height of an object. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  The ID of an object or the object itself. You can also pass an array of objects    	 width  The new width for the object. If id is an array, all the objects referred to are    	 height  The new height for the object.

Variables, Arrays, and Functions  ResizeWidth    ResizeHeight    Plug-in to change an object’s width Plug-in to change an object’s height  How It Works This plug-in simply makes a call to ResizeWidth   followed by one to ResizeHeight  .  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it an object along with a width and height, like this:  Here’s an example you can try that further improves the example in the previous   plug-in to resize both the width and height of an object with only a single call:  Resize 'mydiv', 100, 100   Or you can pass an array of objects, like this:  ids = Array 'obj1', 'obj2', 'obj3'   Resize  ids, 128, 128    Example div        window.onload = function    {     S 'example' .backgroundColor = 'red'     S 'example' .color           = 'white'     Resize 'example', 100, 100   }     The Plug-in function Resize id, width, height   {     ResizeWidth id,  width      ResizeHeight id, height   }      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    79    22  Position   This plug-in sets the CSS style.position property of an object. This is useful when you  wish to control an object’s offset from its parent’s location, or even completely move it to  any absolute position. Figure 4-4 shows a div that has been offset horizontally from its  previous position by 100 pixels.  About the Plug-in This plug in sets the CSS style.position property of an object. It requires the following  arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 type  The type of style.position property to assign, out of ‘absolute’, ‘fixed’,  ‘relative’, ‘static’ or ‘inherit’. You can also use the shorter, global variables  created  by the Initialize   plug-in  of ABS, FIX, REL, STA and INH.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  position  The object’s style.position property  How It Works This function uses the capability of the S   function that accepts an object, an object ID, or  even an array of objects and or object IDs. Therefore, it simply passes the values in id and  type directly to the S   plug-in.  How To Use It To set an object’s style.position property using this plug-in, make a call such as:  Position 'myobject', ABS   Figure 4-4  This plug-in enables objects to be moved.      80   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     For example, to change an object to have an ‘absolute’ position  using the shorter, global   variable ABS created by the Initialize   plug-in  and then move it, you could use code  such as the following:   Move Me        window.onload = function    {     S 'moveme' .backgroundColor = 'red'     S 'moveme' .color           = 'white'     Position 'moveme', REL      S 'moveme' .left            = Px 100   }     This example creates a div called ‘moveme’, which is then set to white text on a red   background, and then the Position   plug-in is called to give it a ‘relative’ position.  Finally, its style.left property is set to 100 using the Px   plug-in, which offsets it  horizontally from its parent object by 100 pixels.  Caution  As well as the difference in location change between divs that use ‘absolute’ and ‘relative’   style positions, you also need to take into account the fact that a div with an ‘absolute’ style  position is automatically shrunk to fit its contents, whereas one with a ‘relative’ style position  will retain its previous width which, by default, extends to the right hand edge of its containing  object. If you use a span instead, it will always shrink to fit its contents, regardless of where or  how it is positioned.  The Plug-in function Position id, type   {     S id, 'position', type   }    23  GoTo   If an object has been set free from the page, for example by using the previous plug-in,  Position  , then you can move it to another location by changing its style.left and  style.top properties, and this plug-in makes it quicker and easier by providing a single  function to do this. In Figure 4-5, a div has been moved by 200 pixels to the right and by   25 pixels down.      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    81  Figure 4-5  The GoTo   plug-in moves an object.  About the Plug-in This plug-in moves an object  if it is movable  to a new location. It takes the following  arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 x  The horizontal offset, from the left edge of the parent object, to which the object   should be moved  or from the browser edge if the object has a style.position  property of ‘fixed’ or ‘absolute’     	 y  The vertical offset, from the top edge of the parent object, to which the object  should be moved  or from the browser top if the object has a style.position  property of ‘fixed’ or ‘absolute’    Variables, Arrays, and Functions  left  top  Px    The object’s style.left property The object’s style.top property Plug-in to add the suffix ‘px’  How It Works This plug-in also takes advantage of the S   plug-in’s capability to manage arrays of objects  and or object IDs, single objects, or object IDs. It makes just two calls: one to set the object’s  style.left property to the value in x with the suffix ‘px’ appended, as is required by  the rules of CSS, and the other to do the same but with the style.top property using   the value in y.  How To Use It To use this plug-in make sure that an object is movable by first issuing a command such as  this  using the global variable REL, which contains the string ‘relative’ :  Position 'advertdiv', REL       82   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The following example gives the div an ‘absolute’ position  using the global variable   ABS  and then moves it:   Move Me        window.onload = function    {     S 'moveme' .backgroundColor = 'green'     S 'moveme' .color           = 'cyan'     Position 'moveme', ABS      GoTo 'moveme', 200, 25   }     The Plug-in function GoTo id, x, y   {     S id, 'left', Px x       S id, 'top',  Px y    }    24  Locate   This plug-in combines the Position   and GoTo   plug-ins into a very handy single  plug-in that is especially useful when first setting up objects on a web page. With it you  can set an object’s style.position property at the same time as its horizontal and  vertical offsets. Figure 4-6 shows this plug-in moving an object with an ‘absolute’ position  to the location 100,40.  About the Plug-in This plug-in sets an object’s style.position property as well as its horizontal and vertical  offsets. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 type  The type of style.position property to assign, out of ‘absolute’, ‘fixed’,  ‘relative’, ‘static’, or ‘inherit’  or the global variables ABS, FIX, REL, STA and INH   Figure 4-6  Setting an object’s position and location at the same time      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    83   	 x  The horizontal offset, from the left edge of the parent object  or browser for   ‘fixed’ objects , to which the object should be moved  or from the browser edge if  the object has a style.position property of ‘fixed’ or ‘absolute’     	 y  The vertical offset, from the top edge of the parent object  or browser for ‘fixed’  objects , to which the object should be moved  or from the browser top if the object  has a style.position property of ‘fixed’ or ‘absolute’    Variables, Arrays, and Functions  Position    GoTo    Plug-in to set an object’s style.position property Plug-in to move an object to a new location  How It Works This plug-in draws on the functionality of the plug-ins Position   and GoTo  , which  both allow an object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs to be accessed.  Therefore, it simply calls each in turn, passing the arguments id, style, x, and y, as  necessary.  How To Use It To set an object’s style.position property and move it to its correct location using this  plug-in, you might use code such as the following:   Move Me        window.onload = function    {     S 'moveme' .backgroundColor = 'orange'     S 'moveme' .color           = 'black'     Locate 'moveme', ABS, 100, 40   }     In the preceding you can see the Locate   plug-in provides a wide range of   functionality with a single call.  note  The absolute position property is always made relative to the first parent element that has a   position other than static. A relative position is relative to its containing object, and a fixed  property is relative to the browser borders.  The Plug-in function Locate id, type, x, y   {     Position id, type      GoTo id, x, y   }       84   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       25  GetWindowWidth   There are many reasons to need to know the width of the browser window, the most  obvious of which is so that you can determine which objects you can display where in a  dynamically generated website. This plug-in gives you that exact information, as shown by  the alert box in Figure 4-7. It also takes into account any scroll bars that might reduce the  available width.  About the Plug-in This function will tell you the width of the browser window to the nearest pixel. It doesn’t  require any arguments and returns the width as an integer.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  de  BROWSER  barwidth  scrollHeight  clientHeight  innerWidth  clientWidth  Local object copy of document.documentElement Global variable containing the browser name Local integer variable set if a vertical scroll bar exists The de.scrollHeight property The de.clientHeight property The window.innerWidth property The de.clientWidth and document.body.clientWidth  properties  How It Works This plug-in first copies the document.documentElement object into de to provide a much  shorter name, reducing the amount of code to enter. Next, if the browser is not Internet  Explorer as determined by the value in the global variable BROWSER, then the local integer  variable barwidth is set to a value of 17 if the value in de.scrollHeight is greater than  that in de.clientHeight.  Figure 4-7  Determining the available width of the browser window      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    85  The de.scrollHeight value is bigger when there is more web page below the bottom  that can be scrolled to. In that case, there will be a scroll bar, so barwidth is given the value  of 17, which is the default width of scrollbars in all browsers. This value is then subtracted  from the full window width and the result is returned.  Otherwise, as is often the case if the browser is Internet Explorer, the code simply   returns the value of whichever has a value, either de.clientWidth or document.body  .clientWidth  allowing for either strict or quirks mode . This value already takes into  account any scroll bar, so no further code is required.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, simply call it and use the value returned, as in the following example,  which passes the returned value to an alert   statement, where it is displayed:     window.onload = function    {     alert 'This browser has a window width of: ' + GetWindowWidth     }     The Plug-in function GetWindowWidth    {     var de = document.documentElement       if  BROWSER != 'IE'      {        var barwidth = de.scrollHeight > de.clientHeight ? 17 : 0        return window.innerWidth - barwidth     }       return de.clientWidth  document.body.clientWidth  }    26  GetWindowHeight   This is the companion plug-in to GetWindowWidth  . It returns the height of the browser  window, bearing in mind any scroll bars. In Figure 4-8 the height of the usable area of this  browser has been determined by this plug-in to be 124 pixels.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes no arguments and returns the available height of the current window,  taking any scroll bars into account.      86   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 4-8  Determining the usable height of the current browser window  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  de  BROWSER  barwidth  scrollWidth  clientWidth  innerHeight  clientHeight  Local object copy of document.documentElement Global variable containing the browser name Local integer variable set if a vertical scrollbar exists The de.scrollWidth property The de.clientWidth property The window.innerHeight property The de.clientHeight and document.body.clientHeight  properties  How It Works This plug-in works in almost the same way as GetWindowWidth   except that it returns the  available height in the current browser window, taking any scroll bars into account. Please  refer to GetWindowWidth   for further details.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, simply call it and use the value returned as in the following example,  which passes the returned value to an alert   statement where it is displayed:     window.onload = function    {     alert 'This browser has a window height of: ' + GetWindowHeight     }     The following plug-in is a good example of how this and the previous plug-in,   GetWindowWidth  , come in very handy.      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    87  The Plug-in function GetWindowHeight    {     var de = document.documentElement       if  BROWSER != 'IE'      {        var barwidth = de.scrollWidth > de.clientWidth ? 17 : 0        return window.innerHeight - barwidth     }       return de.clientHeight  document.body.clientHeight  }    27  GoToEdge   These plug-ins are starting to come together in such a way that it’s now easy to build a  plug-in that will move one or more objects to one of the edges of the browser, which is what  this one does: it allows you to move objects to the top, left, right, or bottom edges of the  browser, as shown in Figure 4-9.  About the Plug-in This plug-in locates one or more objects at one of the four edges of the browser window. It  requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects or object IDs  	 where  The edge to which the object or objects should be moved, out of ‘top’,    	 percent  The distance from the left or top of the browser depending on the value   ‘bottom’, ‘left’, or ‘right’  in where  Figure 4-9  Attaching GIF images to different edges of the browser      88   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  width  height  W    H    GoTo    amount TP, BM, LT and RT  GetWindowWidth    GetWindowHeight    Local integer for indexing into id if its an array Local variable containing the width of the browser, less that of  id Local variable containing the height of the browser, less that of  id Local variable containing percent as a percent Global variables with the values ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’, and ‘right’ Plug-in to return the browser width Plug-in to return the browser height Plug-in to return the width of an object Plug-in to return the height of an object Plug-in to move an object to a new location  How It Works Like many others, this plug-in supports the passing of an object, an object ID, or an array of  objects and or object IDs. This is managed by the initial if   section, which determines  whether id is an array using the instanceof operator. If it is, then each element of the  array is recursively passed to the same function, along with the values of where and  percent. Once all have been processed, the function then returns.  After this the three local variables width, height, and amount are assigned values   representing the amount of width and height remaining in the browser window  after the  width and height of the object are taken into account . This is done by fetching the width and  height of the browser window using the GetWindowWidth   and GetWindowHeight    plug-ins and then subtracting the object’s width from one and its height from the other, as  determined by calls to W   and H  .  The variable amount is set to percent  100 so that it can be used as a multiplier. For  example, if percent has a value of 40, then dividing it by 100 assigns it the value of 0.40,  which can then be multiplied by any number to reduce it to 40 percent of its original value.  In this case, the multiplier determines how far along an edge the object should appear. Next, a switch   statement tests for the four allowed argument values for where,   which are ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’, or ‘right’. The shorthand global variable equivalents of TP,  BM, LT, and RT are used in place of these values to make the code shorter and clearer. A  break command ends each subsection of the switch   statement except for the final one,  where it is not required because program flow will continue on the next line down anyway. Depending on which of the four values has been passed in where, the local variables x  and y are set to align the object in id right up against the edge specified. The object is also  displayed at a position between 0 and 100 percent along  or down , according to the value  in percent. Finally, a call to GoTo   is made to move the object to the new location.  There are many uses for this plug-in; one in particular is a dock bar, similar to the one   used at the bottom of the screen on the Apple OS X operating system, with a row or column  of expanding and collapsing icons. Plug-in 66, DockBar   provides exactly this functionality,  for any web page.      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    89  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass an object to it along with details on where to display it, as in the  following example, which displays four different icons, one per edge:                   window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'      Position ids, FIX      GoToEdge 'i1', TP, 50      GoToEdge 'i2', BM, 10      GoToEdge 'i3', LT, 33      GoToEdge 'i4', RT, 66   }     In the first section of HTML, four GIF images are loaded in, with each given a different   ID. Then, in the   section the array ids is populated with these IDs so that the  following Position   command can set all of them to have a style.position of ‘fixed’.  This means they will stay where they are put, even if the browser page scrolls.  Finally, each image is attached to a different edge using four different calls to GoToEdge  .   The top one is 50 percent in, the bottom 10 percent in, the left 33 percent down, and the  right 66 percent down.  note  As with all of this book’s examples, you can download this plug-in and all associated content    such as the images used  from the companion website at pluginjavascript.com.  The Plug-in function GoToEdge id, where, percent   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            GoToEdge id[j], where, percent         return     }       var width  = GetWindowWidth    - W id      var height = GetWindowHeight   - H id      var amount = percent   100       switch where      {        case TP: var x = width * amount       90   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s                    var y = 0                 break        case BM: var x = width * amount                 var y = height                 break        case LT: var x = 0                 var y = height * amount                 break        case RT: var x = width                 var y = height * amount     }       GoTo id, x, y   }    28  CenterX   Another very useful function is to center an object, which is what this plug-in does. By  using the browser width and object width it moves an object horizontally to exactly the  center of the browser. Figure 4-10 shows a div that has been centered horizontally using   this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in centers an object  or objects  on a horizontal axis. It requires the following  argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects or object IDs  Figure 4-10  Centering a div horizontally      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    91  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  left  SCROLL_X  W    Px    GetWindowWidth    Local integer variable for indexing into id if it is an array The style.left property of object Global variable containing the number of pixels by which the  browser has scrolled horizontally The available width of the browser window, taking into account  any scroll bars Plug-in to fetch an object’s width Plug-in to append the suffix ‘px’  How It Works This plug-in allows arrays of objects and or object IDs, as well as single objects or object  IDs. It does this by using the instanceof operator to tell whether id is an array and, if it is,  it iterates through the array using the local variable j as an index, recursively calling itself  with the single element values. Upon completion, the if   section of code returns.  In the second part of the plug-in, the S   plug-in sets the object’s style.left property to   the correct value  using a call to Px   to add the ‘px’ suffix  to center the object horizontally.   The correct value is determined by looking up the width of the window  less 17 if   there’s a scroll bar , minus the width of id. This value is then divided by 2. For example, if  the window is 600 pixels wide and the object is 100  and there is no scroll bar , the value is  determined by  subtracting 100 from 600, which equals 500; and this number is divided by 2  to get a final result of 250. Therefore, an offset of 250 pixels from the left will exactly center  an object of 100 pixels width in a 600-pixel wide browser. If there is a scroll bar, the values  become 583 – 100   2, which equals 241.5. The Math.round   call deals with a fractional  result, which in this case is rounded up to 242.  If the browser has not scrolled, this is all the calculation that is needed. However, because  the horizontal offset is from the left edge of the document  not the window , if there has been  a horizontal scroll the object will be displayed left of center by the amount of the scrolling.  Therefore, the global variable SCROLL_X is added to the calculated value in order to place the  object exactly between the left and right hand edges of the window.  How To Use It To center an object, as long as it is capable of being moved, just call CenterX   in the  following manner, which creates a simple div and then centers it:   &nbsp;Test div        window.onload = function    {     Locate 'test', ABS, 20, 20      Resize 'test', 100, 100      S 'test' .border = 'solid ' + Px 1      CenterX 'test'   }         92   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The &nbsp; entity is there to separate the text from the border, which it otherwise runs  into. The Locate   call sets the ‘test’ div to an ‘absolute’ position using the global variable  ABS for shorthand. It also locates the div at the position 20,20. The Resize   call then turns  the div into a 100 by 100-pixel square. Then, in this example, rather than using colors to  make the div easy to see, the div has been given a solid border with a call to S  .  Finally, a call is made to CenterX   and the div is centered horizontally.  The Plug-in function CenterX id   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            CenterX id[j]         return     }       S id .left = Px Math.round  GetWindowWidth   - W id      2 + SCROLL_X   }     29  CenterY   This is the partner plug-in to CenterX  , which enables you to center an object vertically.  Figure 4-11 shows a div that has been centered using this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in centers an object  or objects  on a vertical axis. It requires the following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects or object IDs  Figure 4-11  Centering a div vertically      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    93  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  top  SCROLL_Y  H    Px    GetWindowHeight    Local integer variable for indexing into id if it is an array The style.top property of object Global variable containing the number of pixels by which the  browser has scrolled vertically The available height of the browser window, taking into account  any scroll bars Plug-in to fetch an object’s height Plug-in to append the suffix ‘px’  How It Works This plug-in is almost identical to CenterX  , except that an object is centered along its  vertical axis. See the section on CenterX   for more details.  How To Use It To center an object vertically using this plug-in, you might use code such as the following:  &nbsp;Test div        window.onload = function    {     Locate 'test', ABS, 20, 20      Resize 'test', 100, 100      S 'test' .border = 'solid ' + Px 1      CenterY 'test'   }     This example creates a div in the HTML section and then, in the   section, it   sets the object’s style.position property to ‘absolute’ using the Locate   command and  the global variable ABS. It also moves the object to location 20,20.  The div is then resized using Resize   to a width and height of 100. After that it is   given a single-pixel border to make it stand out and then, on the final line, the CenterY    plug-in is called to center it vertically.  The Plug-in function CenterY id   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            CenterY id[j]         return     }       S id .top = Px Math.round  GetWindowHeight   - H id      2 + SCROLL_Y    }      94   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       30  Center   More often than not, when you center an object you usually want to do so in both horizontal  and vertical directions, so this plug-in brings both the previous ones together into a single  function, as shown in Figure 4-12.  About the Plug-in This plug-in centers an object  or objects  on both its vertical and horizontal axes. It requires  the following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects or object IDs  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  CenterX    CenterY    Plug-in to center an object horizontally Plug-in to center an object vertically  How It Works Since both the CenterX   and CenterY   plug-ins have been written to take arguments  that can be an array of objects and or object IDs, an object, or an object ID, there is little  work for this plug-in to do, so it simply calls each one in turn, passing id  whether or not  it’s an array  to each.  Figure 4-12  Centering a div both horizontally and vertically      C h a p t e r   4 :   L o c a t i o n   a n d   D i m e n s i o n s    95  How To Use It To fully center an object in both the horizontal and vertical directions you could use code  such as the following:   Test div        window.onload = function    {     Locate 'test', ABS, 20, 20      Resize 'test', 100, 100      S 'test' .border = 'solid ' + Px 1      Center 'test'   }     This example is very similar to the previous two, except that it calls the Center     plug-in at the end to fully center the div.  That covers this chapter’s plug-ins, and we’re about to start really cooking, because in  the following chapter we’ll begin making objects invisible, and then make them reappear,  smoothly fade them in and out, and even more. Along the way I’ll show you how to put  these effects to good use.  The Plug-in function Center id   {     CenterX id      CenterY id   }   This page intentionally left blank    Chapter 5  Visibility      98   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       31  Many of the most impressive effects you’ll see on websites are also the simplest. For   example, a smooth fade from one image to another is often far more beautiful  than other wipe or dissolve transformations. Likewise, instantly revealing or   hiding an object, when done well, is clean and easy on the eye.  This chapter focuses on these types of effects, ranging from setting the visibility  or  invisibility  of an object to fading objects in and out, fading between objects, and so on.   The plug-ins in this chapter also provide the basic functionality required by many later  plug-ins—most particularly the menu and navigation plug-ins in Chapter 8.  Invisible   To ease into this chapter, we’ll begin with a few short and sweet plug-ins that every JavaScript  programmer needs in their toolkit. The first one is Invisible  , which makes an object  disappear from a web page while the space it occupies remains, as opposed to hiding an  object, which collapses and causes elements around it to assume its space  see Plug-in 40,  Hide   for that effect .  Figure 5-1 shows a span with the text “Now you see me…” followed by some plain text   not in a div that reads “and soon you won’t”. An alert window has been raised to let you  see these elements before the call to Invisible   is made. Figure 5-2 shows what happens  after clicking the alert: the shaded text in the span is invisible, but the other text snippet  remains in place, demonstrating that the span is still there, just not visible.  About the Plug-in This plug-in makes an object invisible while retaining the object’s position and dimensions.  It requires the following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  visibility  HID  The style.visibility property of the object s  Global variable with the value ‘hidden’  Figure 5-1  The shaded area is a span set to disappear when the alert is clicked.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    99  Figure 5-2  After clicking the alert the shaded span becomes invisible.  How It Works This plug-in makes a call to the S   plug-in in such a way that you can pass it an array of  objects and or object IDs, a single object, or an object ID. The style.visibility property  of the object  or objects  is then set to the value in the global variable HID, which is ‘hidden’.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it the object or objects to make invisible. The following example  shows one way you might incorporate it:   Now you see me...  and soon you won't       window.onload = function    {     S 'ghost' .backgroundColor = 'lightblue'     Resize 'ghost', 128, 32      alert 'Click OK to see the object disappear'      Invisible 'ghost'   }     This example first creates a span in the HTML section and gives it some text. Following   this is more text that isn’t included within the span. Then, in the   section, the  span’s background color is set to light blue and resized to make it stand out.  Next, an alert is raised to give you the chance to see the initial display before the call to  the Invisible   plug-in is made. After clicking the alert OK button, the call is made, and  the contents of the span becomes invisible.  Tip  When you want to keep your layout unchanged when hiding an object, you should use this   plug-in in preference to Plug-in 40, Hide  . Plug-in 31 preserves an object’s dimensions, while  Plug-in 40 fully collapses an object, causing elements surrounding it to move in and occupy  newly vacant space.      100   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Plug-in function Invisible id   {     S id, 'visibility', HID   }    32  Visible   This is the partner plug-in to Invisible  . It makes a previously invisible object visible.  Figure 5-3 expands the example in the previous plug-in. Now, when the alert message’s OK  button is clicked, the invisible text will reappear and the browser will look like Figure 5-1  again  but without the alert window .  About the Plug-in This plug-in makes an object visible after it has been made invisible. It requires the  following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  visibility  VIS  The style.visibility property of the object s  Global variable with the value ‘visible’  How It Works This plug-in makes a call to the S   plug-in in such a way that you can pass it an array of  objects and or object IDs, a single object, or an object ID. Then the style.visibility  property of the object  or objects  is set to the value in the global variable VIS, which   is ‘visible’.  Figure 5-3  After clicking OK the hidden text reappears.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    101  How To Use It To make invisible objects reappear, just pass them to this plug-in. The following example  extends the previous plug-in example to make the hidden span reappear:   Now you see me...  and soon you won't       window.onload = function    {     S 'ghost' .backgroundColor = 'lightblue'     Resize 'ghost', 128, 32      alert 'Click OK to see the object disappear'      Invisible 'ghost'      alert 'Click OK to see the object reappear'      Visible 'ghost'   }     Just the final two lines of code in this example are new: an alert, so that you can verify  that the span was made invisible, and a call to Visible   that is executed after clicking  OK, which makes the object reappear.  The Plug-in function Visible id   {     S id, 'visibility', VIS   }    33  VisibilityToggle   This plug-in inverses the visibility of an object. If it is visible it becomes invisible, or if it is  invisible it becomes visible. In Figure 5-4, each time the button is clicked, the text to the  right toggles between being visible and invisible.  Figure 5-4  Attaching a plug-in to a button’s click event      102   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in Each time this plug-in is called, the object or objects passed to it change their visibility to the  opposite state. It requires the following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  visibility  j  HID  VIS  Local integer for indexing into id if it is an array The object’s style.visibility property Global variable with the value ‘hidden’ Global variable with the value ‘visible’  How It Works This plug-in uses the recursive trick that many others employ to handle arrays of objects and  or object IDs, as well as single objects and object IDs. It does this using the instanceof  operator to test whether id is an array. If it is, the array is iterated through using the local  variable j in a for   loop, individually calling the function itself recursively for each element  of the array. Once it’s done, the function returns.  If id is not an array, the S   plug-in is called, along with the inverse value of the object’s  style.visibility property. This is achieved using the following ternary expression, along  with the two global variables HID and VIS, which stand for the strings ‘hidden’ and ‘visible’:  S id .visibility =  S id .visibility == HID  ? VIS : HID  In plain English, this statement equates to “If the current value of the object’s style   .visibility property is ‘hidden’, then return the value ‘visible’; otherwise return the  value ‘hidden’.” Everything after the first equals sign and before the question mark is the test.  The value immediately following it is the one to return if the test result is true, and the final  value is to be returned if the test result is false.  All this has the effect of applying the opposite state of the visibility property to the   object.  How To Use It You can call this plug-in directly from within JavaScript, like this:  VisibilityToggle 'myobject'   Or you can pass an array of objects, like this:  ids = Array 'firstobj', 'secondobj', 'thirdobj'   VisibilityToggle ids   Alternatively, you can incorporate the call within an HTML statement, as in the  following two lines of HTML that cause the text in the span called ‘toggle’ to switch       C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    103  between being invisible or invisible each time the button is clicked  you could equally  attach it to an onmouseover or other event too :  <input type='submit' value='Click Me'     onclick="VisibilityToggle 'toggle' "  >   Toggling Text   You will see this plug-in used in a number of the other plug-ins, in various ways.  NoTe  Calling this plug-in from HTML illustrates the main reason why nearly all these plug-ins   allow you to pass either an object or an object ID. In the preceding example, the object ID of  ‘toggle’ is passed to the plug-in, but the object this  which is an object, not the ID of an object   can also be passed, thus telling the plug-in that the HTML object in which the call is embedded is  the one to manipulate. This is how rollover and other similar effects are achieved—you’ll see  more on this in the next plug-in, and in Chapter 8, “Menus and Navigation.”  The Plug-in function VisibilityToggle id   {     if  id instanceof Array       {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            VisibilityToggle id[j]         return     }       S id .visibility = S id .visibility == HID ? VIS : HID  }    34  Opacity   Being able to switch an object from visible to invisible is great, but sometimes you need  finer control over an object’s visibility. This is referred to in JavaScript by the inverse term:  its opacity. With this plug-in, you can set the opacity of any object to a value between 0 percent   totally transparent, or invisible  and 100 percent  fully opaque, nothing behind shows  through .  Figure 5-5 shows three buttons displayed using the default opacity of 100 percent.    In Figure 5-6 each button has been clicked to change its value to 25 percent, 50 percent, or   75 percent, respectively.  About the Plug-in This plug-in applies the opacity setting supplied to the object or objects it is passed. It requires  the following arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 percent  The amount of opacity to apply to the object or objects, from 0 percent,   which is fully transparent, to 100 percent, which is fully opaque.      104   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 5-5  Three button objects at the default opacity of 100 percent  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  opacity  MozOpacity  KhtmlOpacity  filter  The style.opacity property as used by most browsers The version of the opacity property used by Mozilla-based  browsers such as Firefox The version of the opacity property used on older versions of the  Apple Safari browser Used to implement Microsoft’s version of the opacity property   and many other properties too   How It Works This plug-in makes four different calls in turn because various browsers approach the subject  of opacity in different ways. Fortunately, none of the methods clash with each other, so a lot  of if…then…else code is not necessary.  The first line for most browsers  such as Opera, Google Chrome, and recent versions of   Apple Safari  looks like this:  S id, 'opacity', percent   100   Figure 5-6  After being clicked, the buttons are at 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent opacity.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    105  This simply takes the value in percent, divides it by 100, and applies it to the style   .opacity property of id. Of course, if id is an array, all its elements will have that property  updated.  However, Mozilla-based browsers such as Firefox have their own property for this   function, so the following line of code performs the equivalent for them by changing the  style.MozOpacity property. Likewise, the third line is for Safari browsers that use the   old rendering engine  before Webkit was introduced  and therefore require the style  .KhtmlOpacity property be changed.  Finally, Microsoft chose a more complicated approach and includes opacity as part of   their nonstandard filters and transitions group of features. The object’s filter property is set  in the following manner  for a setting of 25 percent, for example :  S id .filter = 'alpha opacity = 25 '  However, because you need to take into account the fact that id could be an array, the  following version of the call is made, with both the property and setting values also passed  to the S   plug-in:  S id, 'filter', 'alpha opacity = 25 '   Also, rather than a numeric value, a string has to be assigned to the filter property,  which requires construction. So, in order to place the value in percent into the string, the  following code is used  employing the InsVars   plug-in from Chapter 3 :  S id, 'filter', InsVars "alpha opacity = '1' ", percent    How To Use It To change an object’s opacity, just pass it along with the object or its ID  or an array of  objects and or object IDs . You can use a JavaScript command like this:  Opacity 'fadeddiv', 64   three clickable buttons:  Or, you can embed the call within HTML, as in the following example, which creates    Click the buttons            When clicked, the different buttons will change their opacity by the assigned amount    25 percent, 50 percent, or 75 percent, respectively . Notice that none of these HTML  elements have been assigned IDs because the keyword this has been passed to the  Opacity   plug-in, thus taking advantage of the fact that this plug-in  like most of them   will accept either an object ID or an object. The this keyword directly passes the calling  object to the function, which is why no ID name is required.      106   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Plug-in function Opacity id, percent   {     S id, 'opacity',      percent   100      S id, 'MozOpacity',   percent   100      S id, 'KhtmlOpacity', percent   100      S id, 'filter',       InsVars "alpha opacity = '1' ", percent    }    35  Fade   This plug-in makes great use of the previous one, Opacity  , by making it possible to  smoothly change an object’s opacity over time. In Figure 5-7, two images have had their IDs  attached to mouse events so that they will fade in and out.  About the Plug-in This plug-in fades an object from one opacity value to another  either increasing or decreasing  it  over a set number of milliseconds. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 start  The beginning level of opacity  	 end  The final level of opacity  	 msecs  The number of milliseconds the fade should take  	 interruptible   If this option is set, an object’s fade can be interrupted and   replaced with a new fade on the same object; otherwise, the fade will continue until  it has finished.   	 CB  This argument is sometimes passed by other plug-ins when a second function   is to be called once this one has finished execution. Its value is simply a string variable  containing the name of the function to call. Because it is not generally a user passable  value, I will no longer mention CB in the list of arguments, unless it is being used in  a different manner.  Figure 5-7  The left image is slowly fading into the background.

At almost 50 lines of code it isn’t short, but  don’t be put off by it; the coding is straightforward, and you’ve seen many of its parts  before. If you can work through this plug-in, you’ll be able to follow them all.  This function works by using interrupts to call a function at regular intervals to change   the opacity of an object by a small amount each time  which is how all the transition and  animation plug-ins in this book work . To do this, the plug-in comes in two parts. The first  part prepares all the variables and initiates the interrupts, and the second part receives the  interrupt calls and performs the incremental opacity changes.      108   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Let’s start with the first if   section of code. There’s nothing unusual here; it simply  passes id back to the same function recursively to be dealt with an element at a time if it’s  an array:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         Fade id[j], start, end, msecs, interruptible, CB      return  }  After that, the local variable stepval is created, like this:  var stepval = Math.abs start - end     msecs   INTERVAL   Its value is calculated by finding the difference between the start and end opacity values;   that is, it subtracts one from the other and then passes the result through the Math.abs    function. This gives a positive integer representing the difference, like this:  Math.abs start - end   Then the length of time the fade should take, which has been passed as a value in  milliseconds in the variable msecs, is divided by INTERVAL, which is the number of  milliseconds between each frame of the transition  30 by default . The code for that is  simple division:   msecs   INTERVAL   The first value  the start and end difference  is then divided by the second   the timing    and then assigned to the variable stepval.  A Specific Case Let’s see what value this calculation comes out as by assuming that start has a value of 0,  end has a value of 100, and msecs has a value of 1000. This gives us the following formula:  Math.abs 0 - 100     1000   30   The calculation comes to 100    1000   30 , and the answer is the value 3 . In terms of   this code, this means that, if the following three things are true:         1.  The interrupt is going to take place once every 30 milliseconds, 2.  You want the animation to take 1000 milliseconds, 3.  There are 100 levels of opacity,  Then the distance between each level of opacity should be 3. In other words, to smoothly  fade from a value of 0 to 100 over the course of 1 second, there will be 33.33 steps, separated  by 3 levels of opacity.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    109  A Standard Formula The preceding formula is how almost all the animations and transitions in this book work.  They take the value in milliseconds that you supply for their duration, they then divide that  by the interval  usually 30 milliseconds , and finally they divide the distance between the start  and end points of the animation by the timing value, to find out the amount the animation  needs to move on each step, as shown in the following statement:  var stepval = Math.abs start - end     msecs   INTERVAL   If a Fade Is Already in Progress This plug-in has been designed so that you can force it to proceed until it has finished, or  you can allow it to be interrupted  but only by another Fade   call on the same object . This  is so that you can offer onmouseover and onmouseout routines that will interrupt if you  move your mouse again before the transition completes. That way, a partially faded object  can be made to fade back to its start point again if you take the mouse away.  Alternatively, sometimes you may need to display an uninterrupted animation on the   screen and maybe even chain a few together. You have the option to choose either by setting  the interruptible argument to true if a fade can be interrupted, or false if it cannot.  You can also use 1 and 0 for these values if you prefer.  The next section of code deals with this by looking at the FA_Flag property of id. This   is a new property given to id, which has the value true only when a fade is in progress.  NoTe  Assigning new properties directly to objects is a technique used throughout this book. It’s a   very convenient way of using some object-oriented aspects of JavaScript.  The next section of code checks whether a fade is already in progress. If it is, the code checks   whether the FA_Int property of id is set  to see whether an interrupt is allowed . If it isn’t, the  function immediately exits as it cannot be interrupted. Otherwise, the clearInterval    function is called to end the currently repeating interrupts, and the object’s new FA_Start  property is set to the current value in FA_Fade.  This primes the new fade to start only where the previous one  that was just cancelled    left off, which means that the new fade will ignore the start value that was passed. This  override ensures a very smooth and natural flow between the two transitions. The following  code performs this process:  if  O id .FA_Flag   {     if  !O id .FA_Int  return       clearInterval O id .FA_IID      O id .FA_Start = O id .FA_Level  }  If a Fade Is Not in Progress If a fade isn’t already in progress, the new id property FA_Start is assigned the value in  start so that the remaining code can use this value to know where the fade started from.       110   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The id property FA_Level is also set to start because that is the property that will be  manipulated to track the opacity level on each interrupt. These statements are placed within  an else segment, like this:  else  {     O id .FA_Start = start     O id .FA_Level = start  }  O id .FA_Flag = true  O id .FA_End  = end  O id .FA_Int  = interruptible  The Remaining Assignments In the final few lines of the setup portion of this plug-in, a few other new properties of id  have to be assigned, as follows:  The first line sets the object’s FA_Flag to true, and this is used in other parts of the  code to decide whether or not the plug-in can be entered  or reentered . The second line  makes a copy of the end value in the new property FA_End, and the last assigns the value in  interruptible to the property FA_Int.  Next, the amount by which to change the opacity has to be stored in FA_Step. This is  either stepval if the opacity is going to increase, or -stepval if it will be decreasing, as  determined by this line:  O id .FA_Step = end > O id .FA_Start ? stepval : -stepval  Assisting the FadeToggle   Plug-in The FadeToggle   plug-in, which is covered a little later in this chapter, needs a way to  know whether an object has been faded in or out. To give it this information, the next new  property of id, Fadeout, is set to either true if the object is being faded out, or false if it  is being faded in, like this:  O id .Fadeout = end < O id .FA_Start ? true : false  Initiating the Interrupts The last line of the setup section of the plug-in sets up the repeating interrupts in the  following way:  O id .FA_IID  = setInterval DoFade, INTERVAL   This statement starts off a repeating interrupt that will call the DoFade   subfunction  every INTERVAL milliseconds. The value returned by calling setInterval   is saved in  the new id property FA_IID, as it is needed later when it’s time to cancel the interrupts.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    111  The DoFade   Subfunction This function is a subfunction of Fade   and is known as a private method or private  function. Such functions share all the local variables of the parent function, so there’s no  need to pass them as arguments and, because they can only be used by the parent function,  they don’t clutter up the namespace.  This makes them ideal to use as interrupt or event driven functions, which is exactly   what I have done in this plug-in. Every INTERVAL milliseconds  30 by default , DoFade   is  called up by JavaScript. It has one main job, which is to change the opacity of id by just a  little. The following line is the one that changes the value for this:  O id .FA_Level += O id .FA_Step  This simply adds the value of  the FA_Step property of id to its FA_Level property.    If FA_Step is positive, the value is therefore added, but if it is negative it is subtracted    for example 100 + –3 is 97,  because the first + gets ignored .  If the Final Opacity Has Been Reached Having derived this new value, it’s time to check whether it is the final value wanted, and if  so whether the animation has completed. The code to do that is slightly verbose:  if  O id .FA_Level >= Math.max O id .FA_Start, O id .FA_End        O id .FA_Level <= Math.min O id .FA_Start, O id .FA_End    Essentially, it checks whether the current opacity value  in FA_Level  has reached the  final required value  in FA_End . If it is the same as or greater than  or less than, in the case  of decreasing  the final value, then the following code segment is executed:  O id .FA_Level = O id .FA_End  O id .FA_Flag  = false  clearInterval O id .FA_IID   In this section, the value of FA_Level is set to the exact value in  FA_End. This must be  done because FA_Level will often have a fractional value, and one final frame of animation  is almost always required to ensure that the correct final opacity level is reached.  After this the FA_Flag property of id is set to false to indicate that the fade has finished.  This is immediately followed by a call to clearInterval   with the value that was saved in  the FA_IID property. This cancels any further interrupts.  The CB Argument The final statement in this if   section is as follows:  if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB   It checks the argument passed in CB  if any  and uses the eval   function to evaluate    it. This type of procedure is called  a callback and is used by the chaining plug-ins. In a  nutshell, now that this plug-in has completed running, this call allows any plug-ins that  may be chained to follow this one to begin their execution. However, this happens only if  the argument CB has a value.      112   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     This argument is generally passed when you wish to have a second function run when   the plug-in has finished executing; you simply pass the function to call in a string as the  final parameter to plug-ins that support callbacks natively.  NoTe  Chapter 7 covers callbacks and chaining in much more detail, but I have placed this brief   description here due to this being the first plug-in that supports callbacks.  Changing the Opacity The last thing this subfunction does is call the Opacity   plug-in to set the current opacity  value, with this line of code:  Opacity id, O id .FA_Level   If clearInterval   has been called, then that’s the end of it; otherwise, INTERVAL   milliseconds later DoFade   will get called again, and a slightly different value for FA_Level  will be computed and passed to the Opacity   plug-in, until the transition has finished.  NoTe  We spent a lot of time going over this particular plug-in because most of the other animation  and transition plug-ins work in a similar fashion. Once you understand this one, you will more  easily see how the others work.  How To Use It To make an object fade, you would use a command such as this:  Fade 'object', 100, 0, 1000, 0   This will fade the object out starting with full opacity down to being totally transparent,   over the course of one second. The final argument of 0 prevents the fade from being  interrupted.  You can also embed calls to this plug-in within HTML, like this:  <a href='http:  abc.com' onmouseover="Fade 'object', 75, 100, 500, 1 "     onmouseout="Fade 'object', 100, 75, 500, 1 ">My Link   If the link was previously given an opacity of 75, then each time the mouse passes over  it the link will gradually increase opacity over half a second, darkening it. When the mouse  leaves it will fade back to a 75 percent opacity level.  Here’s some example code you can try for yourself  or download from the companion   website at pluginjavascript.com to ensure you have the images :                 window.onload = function         C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    113  {     O 'i1' .onmouseover = function   { Fade 'i1', 100, 0, 1000, 0  }     O 'i1' .onmouseout  = function   { Fade 'i1', 0, 100, 1000, 0  }     O 'i2' .onmouseover = function   { Fade 'i2', 100, 0, 1000, 1  }     O 'i2' .onmouseout  = function   { Fade 'i2', 0, 100, 1000, 1  }  }     The HTML section sets up two images with the IDs of ‘i1’ and ‘i2’. In the   section  the onmouseover and onmouseout events of each are attached so that the objects will fade out  when the mouse passes over them and fade back in again when the mouse leaves. For the sake  of brevity, I used inline, anonymous functions here instead of named functions.  The calls made to Fade   for the first image, ‘i1’, have the interruptible argument set to   0, which means they cannot be interrupted and will always continue to completion. The  second image has the interruptible argument set to 1, which allows interruptions.  The Difference between Interruptible and Noninterruptible Calls Try passing your mouse over the pair of images and note what happens. You will see that  the second image smoothly fades in and out as soon as the mouse enters or leaves it, always  picking up from the opacity level of the fade that was interrupted.  On the other hand, the first image is harder to control because you can only make it fade  out or in from either a fully opaque or a fully transparent state; you cannot interrupt it part  way. This also means that if you move the mouse away from the first image before the  transition has completed, the mouse will already be out, so there will be no onmouseout  event to trigger until you move it back in again and wait for the transition to complete, and  then move the mouse out.  You’ll see what I mean as you experiment with the example, and it will become clear  how the noninterruptible method is ideal for animations and transitions that you want to  always complete, while interruptible ones are best used where user interaction with the  mouse is required.  The Plug-in function Fade id, start, end, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            Fade id[j], start, end, msecs, interruptible, CB         return     }        var stepval = Math.abs start - end     msecs   INTERVAL           if  O id .FA_Flag      {        if  !O id .FA_Int  return          clearInterval O id .FA_IID         O id .FA_Start = O id .FA_Level     }       114   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        else     {        O id .FA_Start = start        O id .FA_Level = start     }       O id .FA_Flag = true     O id .FA_End  = end     O id .FA_Int  = interruptible     O id .FA_Step = end > O id .FA_Start ? stepval : -stepval     O id .Fadeout = end < O id .FA_Start ? true : false     O id .FA_IID  = setInterval DoFade, INTERVAL        function DoFade       {        O id .FA_Level += O id .FA_Step          if  O id .FA_Level >= Math.max O id .FA_Start, O id .FA_End              O id .FA_Level <= Math.min O id .FA_Start, O id .FA_End          {           O id .FA_Level = O id .FA_End           O id .FA_Flag  = false           clearInterval O id .FA_IID            if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB         }          Opacity id, O id .FA_Level      }  }    36  FadeOut   This plug-in will fade out any object or objects passed to it. In Figure 5-8, each of the images  has some text above it that will fade out the image below when the mouse passes over it.  Figure 5-8  The right-hand image has been faded out.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    115  About the Plug-in This plug-in will fade out an object over a period of time specified. It takes the following  arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 msecs  The number of milliseconds the transition should take  	 interruptible   If set, the fade out can be interrupted; otherwise it cannot  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  Fade    Plug-in to fade an object between two levels of opacity  How It Works This plug-in calls the Fade   plug-in, but it requires fewer arguments. Because of the way  Fade   works this plug-in also accepts an object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or  object IDs.  How To Use It Place a call to FadeOut   wherever you would like an object to be faded out. This can be  from within HTML in the form of an onmouseover or onclick event, for example, or you  can place the calls within a section of JavaScript code, as in the following example:       Mouseover 1    Mouseover 2               window.onload = function    {     O 'sp1' .onmouseover = function   { FadeOut 'i1', 500, 1  }     O 'sp2' .onmouseover = function   { FadeOut 'i2', 500, 1  }  }     The HTML portion of this example creates two spans to accompany two images. The     section then attaches to the onmouseover events of each span so that the image  below each one will fade out if the mouse is passed over the span text.  Once an image has been faded out, you can still pass the mouse over each span and the  image will then fade out again. This doesn’t look very good, as the images suddenly appear  before fading, but it can be corrected with the following plug-in.  The Plug-in function FadeOut id, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     Fade id, 100, 0, msecs, interruptible, CB   }       116   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       37  FadeIn   This plug-in is a simple front-end to the Fade   plug-in; it fades in an object that has been  previously faded out, as can be seen in Figure 5-9.  About the Plug-in This plug-in will fade in an object over a period of time specified. It takes the following  arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 msecs  The number of milliseconds the transition should take  	 interruptible   If set, the fade in can be interrupted; otherwise it cannot  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  Fade    Plug-in to fade an object between two levels of opacity  How It Works This plug-in calls the Fade   plug-in, but it requires fewer arguments. Because of the way  Fade   works this plug-in also accepts an object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or  object IDs.  How To Use It You can use this plug-in in much the same way as the previous one: from within HTML or  from a JavaScript section of code. The following example is a modified version of the   Figure 5-9  The right-hand image has been faded in and the left one has been faded back out.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    117  previous one; this example will fade the images in and out as you pass the mouse over the  Mouseover 1 and Mouseover 2 sections:       Mouseover 1    Mouseover 2               window.onload = function    {     O 'sp1' .onmouseover = function   { FadeOut 'i1', 500, 1  }     O 'sp2' .onmouseover = function   { FadeOut 'i2', 500, 1  }     O 'sp1' .onmouseout  = function   { FadeIn 'i1',  500, 1  }     O 'sp2' .onmouseout  = function   { FadeIn 'i2',  500, 1  }  }     The main benefit from using this plug-in with FadeOut   is that together they require   fewer arguments than the Fade   plug-in, are easier to remember, and are shorter. They are  also used by the next two plug-ins, which toggle an object between being faded out or in  and fade smoothly between two objects, respectively.  The Plug-in  function FadeIn id, msecs, interruptible, CB   {    Fade id, 0, 100, msecs, interruptible, CB   }    38  FadeToggle   If you use this plug-in, you don’t need to know the current faded out or in state of an object;  it tracks the state for you and inverts whatever that state is. Figure 5-10 shows an icon of   a house that is being refaded into view with this plug-in.  Figure 5-10  The house is starting to fade into view.      118   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in either fades an object in or out, depending on its previous state. It requires the  following arguments:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 msecs  The number of milliseconds the transition should take  	 interruptible   If set, the fade can be interrupted; otherwise, it cannot  Variables, Arrays, and Functions j  Fadeout  FadeIn    FadeOut    Local variable that iterates through the elements in id if it is an array New property given to id and set to true if it has been faded out Plug-in to fade an object in Plug-in to fade an object out  How It Works This plug-in has to make use of its own code to iterate through id if it is an array because of  the need to individually check the Fadeout property of id for each object. It uses the  standard form of many prior plug-ins to call the same function recursively with single array  elements.  The second half of the plug-in is where the Fadeout property is checked. If it is set to  true, then that value will have been assigned from within the Fade   plug-in, discussed  earlier in this chapter. When set to true, it means that the object has been faded out. If the  Fadeout property doesn’t exist or is set to false, then the object has not been faded out. Therefore, based on the value of Fadeout, a decision is made by the FadeToggle     plug-in to call either the FadeIn   plug-in to fade the object in or the FadeOut   plug-in to  fade it out.  How To Use It You can attach this plug-in to an event from within HTML, or you can call it up from a  section of JavaScript code. In the following example, the same call to FadeToggle   is  attached to both the onmouseover and the onmouseout events of the span:           Houseover        window.onload = function    {     FadeToggle 'i1', 1, 1      O 'sp1' .onmouseover = function   { FadeToggle 'i1', 500, 1  }     O 'sp1' .onmouseout  = function   { FadeToggle 'i1', 500, 1  }  }         C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    119  Make sure to look at the first call in the   section. Notice how it sets a transition   time of just 1 millisecond for the fade. This is the recommended way to set up toggleable  elements to start up in their inverse state because it causes the transition to occur, but over  only a single frame of animation.  This technique is useful if you want the house image to start faded out: the call to   FadeToggle   accomplishes the first fade out as quickly as possible—faster than the eye  can see. When you run the example, you should hardly even notice the image until you  pass the mouse over the text.  With the image faded out, the remaining two lines of code attach to the two mouse  events. The house will smoothly fade in and out as you pass your mouse over the text  because the interruptible argument is set to 1 and allows smooth interrupts to the  transitions.  The Plug-in function FadeToggle id, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            FadeToggle id[j], msecs, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  O id .Fadeout  FadeIn  id, msecs, interruptible, CB      else               FadeOut id, msecs, interruptible, CB   }    39  FadeBetween   This plug-in fades smoothly between two images in a similar manner to a fade transition   in a slideshow program. Figure 5-11 shows two overlaid images in the process of fading  between each other.  Figure 5-11  The house and people icons are fading between each other.      120   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in fades smoothly between two images. It requires the following arguments:   	 id1  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 id2  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 msecs  The number of milliseconds the transition should take  	 interruptible   If set, the fade can be interrupted; otherwise, it cannot  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  FadeOut    FadeIn    Plug-in to fade an object out Plug-in to fade an object in  How It Works This plug-in calls the FadeOut   plug-in for id1 and the FadeIn   plug-in for id2. It is  also possible to supply an object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs to  both plug-ins.   How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it two IDs, objects, or arrays of objects and or object IDs, and they  will fade from the first object to the second. For the best results, you will probably want to  overlay the objects on top of each other so that you can get smooth transitions. However,  the plug-in still works fine if you wish to fade between objects in different locations. The following example illustrates the setting up of your objects and then fading   between them:       Crossover              window.onload = function    {     Locate Array 'i1', 'i2' , ABS, 0, 0      FadeToggle 'i2', 1, 1      O 'sp1' .onmouseover = function   { FadeBetween 'i1', 'i2', 500, 1  }     O 'sp1' .onmouseout  = function   { FadeBetween 'i2', 'i1', 500, 1  }  }     In the HTML section a span is created to which mouse events will be attached and then   two GIF images are loaded.  In the   section the two images are lifted out of the layout by making their   position setting ‘absolute’, then the second image is speedily faded out  over a period of   1 millisecond  so that only the first image is visible.      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    121  The mouse events are attached to the FadeBetween   plug-in so that passing your   mouse over the span text smoothly fades between the images over a period of half a second.  The first FadeBetween   call fades from the first image to the second, while the second call  fades back again.  The Plug-in function FadeBetween id1, id2, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     FadeOut id1, msecs, interruptible, CB      FadeIn  id2, msecs, interruptible, CB   }    40  Hide   This plug-in is different from Plug-in 31, Invisible  , in that when called it completely  collapses the object down to a 0 by 0 pixel space. The object is still there so that it can be  unhidden, but it is not visible. Because it occupies no space, other elements will often move  in to occupy the freed up space. This makes it perfect for menuing and similar features.  In Figure 5-12, a row of three buttons has been created, each of which is attached by its  onclick event to a call to the Hide   plug-in. In Figure 5-13, the middle button is hidden  after being clicked, and the other buttons have moved in to take up the vacant space.  About the Plug-in This plug-in will hide an object, effectively removing it from a web page. It requires the  following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  HI_Flag  display  New property assigned to id and set to true when id is hidden The style.display property of id  Figure 5-12  Three buttons created with click events to hide them      122   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 5-13  The middle button has been clicked and is now hidden.  How It Works This plug-in makes a call to the S   plug-in using the assignment version of the call, so that  id can be an object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs. Each object  has  its style.display property set to ‘none’, which hides it. Additionally, a call to O   is made  with the arguments HI_Flag and true, which sets the new object property Hi_Flag to  true so that other plug-ins can tell that the object has been hidden. This call also supports  arrays.  Finally, any callback function contained in CB is evaluated with the eval   function,   but only if the argument CB  explained in Chapter 7  has a value.   How To Use It To hide an object, pass it to the Hide   plug-in, either from inside a section of JavaScript  code, or from within HTML. The follow example creates three buttons, each of which can be  clicked to make it hide:                    window.onload = function    {     O 'a' .onclick = function   { Hide 'a'  }     O 'b' .onclick = function   { Hide 'b'  }     O 'c' .onclick = function   { Hide 'c'  }  }     Alternatively, the input tags could be written as follows, and then no   section   is necessary:               C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    123  Or, one button can hide another, like this:        The previous two lines each hide the other button, so whichever is clicked first will stay   displayed, since the other button will now be hidden and therefore can’t be clicked.  In the following plug-in you’ll see how Hide   can be combined with Show   for   creating dynamic web page interaction.  The Plug-in function Hide id, CB   {     S id, 'display', 'none'      O id, 'HI_Flag', true      if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB   }    41  Show   This is the partner plug-in for Hide  . With it you can reveal an object that has previously  been hidden. In Figure 5-14 the two plug-ins have been combined to create a mouseover  menu of limericks.  About the Plug-in This plug-in will show an object, restoring its dimensions and location and moving back  any elements that had moved in to take its space. It requires the following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  Figure 5-14  Different limericks appear as the mouse passes each heading.      124   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  HI_Flag  display  New property assigned to id and set to true when id is hidden or  false when it is not The style.display property of id  How It Works This plug-in makes a call to the S   plug-in using the assignment version of the call so that id  can be an object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs. Each object has its  style.display property set to ‘block’, which restores its full width and height. Additionally,  a call to O   is made with the arguments HI_Flag and false, which sets the new object  property Hi_Flag to false, so that other plug-ins can tell that the object is not hidden. This  call also supports arrays.  Finally, any callback function contained in CB is evaluated with the eval   function,   but only if the argument CB  explained in Chapter 7  has a value.  How To Use It Now that you have both Hide   and Show   in your toolkit, you can start to create some  professional results, as in the following example, which features a simple mouseover menu  of headings that call up different sections of HTML when the mouse passes over them:   Limericks by Edward Lear       Beard Limerick     Bee Limerick     Chin Limerick        There was an Old Man with a beard,   Who said, 'It is just as I feared!   Two Owls and a Hen,   Four Larks and a Wren,   Have all built their nests in my beard!'      There was an Old Man in a tree,   Who was horribly bored by a Bee;   When they said, 'Does it buzz?'   He replied, 'Yes, it does!'   'It's a regular brute of a Bee!'      There was a Young Lady whose chin,   Resembled the point of a pin;   So she had it made sharp,   And purchased a harp,   And played several tunes with her chin.        window.onload = function         C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    125  {     Hide Array 'l1', 'l2', 'l3'       O 'h1' .onmouseover = function   { Show 'l1'  }     O 'h1' .onmouseout  = function   { Hide 'l1'  }     O 'h2' .onmouseover = function   { Show 'l2'  }     O 'h2' .onmouseout  = function   { Hide 'l2'  }     O 'h3' .onmouseover = function   { Show 'l3'  }     O 'h3' .onmouseout  = function   { Hide 'l3'  }  }     This is all pretty straightforward. The HTML section  is in two parts. The first displays   a header along with the three spans containing subheadings, and the second displays three  divs, each containing a different limerick.  The   section then hides all three of the divs with a single call to Hide   in  which an array of object IDs is passed. Then follows six statements that attach either the  Hide   or Show   plug-in to the onmouseover or onmouseout events of the subheadings  via the use of anonymous inline functions.  Whenever the mouse is passed over any subheading, the matching div will be displayed   using a call to Show  . As soon as the mouse passes out of the subheading, a matching call  to Hide   is made to remove it again.  Placing the JavaScript within HTML As you will have noticed, my preference when creating such interactive sections of a web  page is to proceed using strong separation between HTML and JavaScript. I find that it  makes the HTML much more readable and far easier to update. However, if you prefer   to embed JavaScript calls within HTML, you could replace the three span lines with the  following:   Beard     Limerick     Bee     Limerick     Chin     Limerick     If you do choose this method of attaching to the mouse events, you can remove the final  six statements from the   section, but you will still need to keep the initial Hide    statement in order to hide all the divs away on page load.  The Plug-in function Show id, CB   {     S id, 'display', 'block'      O id, 'HI_Flag', false      if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB   }      126   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       42  HideToggle   This chapter’s final plug-in combines the Hide   and Show   plug-ins into a single plug-in  that will toggle the value of an object from one state to the other, without you having to  know which state it was in to begin with. Figure 5-15 shows an informational paragraph  that, when clicked, will replace itself with another, simply by issuing a single call to this  plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in will make an object hidden if it is shown or show it if it is hidden. It requires  the following argument:   	 id  An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  HI_Flag  display  Show    Hide    Local variable to iterate through id if it is an array Flag set by the Hide   and Show   plug-ins. If true an object is  hidden, if false or unset it is shown. The style.display property of id Plug-in to show an object that has been hidden Plug-in to hide an object  How It Works This plug-in uses the usual code you have seen a few times to iterate through id if it happens  to be an array. It determines this with the instanceof operator and, if it is an array, the local  variable j iterates through id using a for   loop, passing each individual element of the  array back to the same function recursively. Once the array has been processed, the function  returns.  Figure 5-15  Toggling between sets of info      C h a p t e r   5 :   V i s i b i l i t y    127  If id is not an array, the display property of id is inspected. If its value is not ‘none’,  the object is visible, so the Hide   plug-in is called. Otherwise, the object is visible, so the  Show   plug-in is called.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it an object to be hidden or shown. As in most cases, you can also  pass an object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs. The following example illustrates  creating a couple of different elements and toggling between them:    Democrat Info   The Democratic Party is one of the world's oldest parties, and   has the most registered voters of any party in the world as of   2004. It is considered to be left of center.    Click to see Republican info        Republican Info   The Republican Party is often called the Grand Old Party or the   GOP, despite being the younger of the two major parties.  It is   considered to be right of center.    Click to see Democrat info         window.onload = function    {     Hide 'republican'      O 'democrat' .onclick   = toggle     O 'republican' .onclick = toggle       function toggle       {        HideToggle Array 'democrat', 'republican'       }  }     In the HTML section, two divs are created, one for information on the U.S. Democratic  Party, and the other for the U.S. Republican Party. After the informational text  taken from  Wikipedia  each div also includes a link with which the alternate information can be  displayed.  In the   section, the second div  with the ID of ‘republican’  is hidden so that   only one div is shown. The other div could be hidden instead, but one of them must be  hidden to start with in order for the toggling to work.  Then two attachments are made, one to each onclick event of the divs. They simply  attach the function toggle   to the events, remembering that by leaving out the brackets  the function is attached to the event, rather than the value returned by the function being  attached.  Finally, the toggle   function calls the HideToggle   plug-in, passing it both of    the div IDs. Since one is shown and one is hidden, toggling them both replaces one with   the other.      128   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s  The Plug-in function HideToggle id, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            HideToggle id[j], CB         return     }       if  S id .display != 'none'  Hide id, CB      else Show id, CB   }   Chapter 6  Movement and animation      130   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     From this point on, the plug-ins really start to get interesting as most of the core functions   have now been covered. Using the tools already outlined, the plug-ins in this chapter  enable you to slide objects around the screen, deflate, and inflate objects over time,   and zoom objects in a variety of ways. With all of this, you can create some very impressive  effects with only a few lines of code.    43  Slide   This plug-in allows you to slide an object from one place to another over time, making it  useful for sliding elements in on demand, hiding and revealing objects, or creating animation  effects. Figure 6-1 shows an image in the process of sliding from the bottom left to the top  right of the browser.  About the Plug-in This plug-in moves an object from one location to another over a period of time. It supports  single objects only  not arrays  because if there were more than one object, only the topmost  one would be seen. Therefore, you can pass only an object or an object ID to this plug-in.   It requires the following arguments:  id    Either an object or an object ID—it cannot be an array of objects ,	fry  The top left corner of the initial position for id ,	toy  The top left corner of the final position for id  frx  tox  msecs    The number of milliseconds the animation should take   	  	  	  	  	  interruptible same object; if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible     If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the   Figure 6-1  This plug-in smoothly slides objects over time.      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    131  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  stepx  stepy  count  len1  len2  SL_Flag  SL_Int  SL_IID  INTERVAL  Distance    DoSlide    GoTo    setInterval    clearInterval    Local variable containing the amount by which to move horizontally  in each step Local variable containing the amount by which to move vertically in  each step Local variable to count the steps Local variable containing the start to end distance Local variable containing the new start to end distance after an  animation is interrupted and given now coordinates New property assigned to id: true when a slide is in progress,  otherwise false or unset New property assigned to id: true if the previous call to this plug- in set the slide to uninterruptible New property assigned to id with which the repeating interrupts  can be stopped Global variable with the value 30 Subfunction to calculate the distance between two locations Subfunction to perform the sliding animation Plug-in to move an object to a new location Function to set another function to be called repeatedly Function to stop the interrupts created by setInterval    How It Works The first section of code tests for the existence of the SL_Flag property of id. If it has a value  of true  or 1  then a slide on id is already in progress. This is the statement used:  if  O id .SL_Flag   Next, the property of id, SL_Int is tested. If it is false then the previous call to Slide     for this id set this variable to indicate that the function could not be interrupted, so the  function returns.  Otherwise, interrupting the plug-in is allowed, so the current slide is stopped by calling  clearInterval  , passing it the SL_IID property of id, as returned by SetInterval  .  The code to do this is as follows:  if  !O id .FL_Int  return  else clearInterval O id .SL_IID   Next, because the plug-in has been interrupted, it’s necessary to allow the interrupting  slide to commence from wherever the previous one was halted. What’s more, because the  coordinates of the halted object will not be the start coordinates passed to the interrupting       132   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     call, it’s necessary to ensure that the interrupting call moves at the same speed as the one  specified in the call.  For example, if the call to Slide   specifies an animation time of 1000 milliseconds, but it  interrupts another slide and discovers that the object is now only one third of the distance from  the destination  instead of the 100 percent it would have been if this was the first Slide   call  on the object , then the new slide should only take one-third of 1000 milliseconds to move,   or 333 milliseconds.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem To calculate the new distance to travel, and, therefore, determine the speed of the new slide,  the plug-in uses the Pythagorean theorem, which states that on a right angled triangle, the  volume of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the volumes of the squares  on the other two sides.  This works because if you draw a line between any two points, on a two-dimensional   surface such as a browser, you can draw a horizontal line from one point and a vertical line  from the other so that they meet each other at a single coordinate to create a right angled  triangle, with the longest edge being the line connecting the two locations.  Therefore, using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance between the requested start and   end locations is determined by passing the results of tox - frx and toy - fry to the  subfunction Distance  , like this:  var len1 = Distance tox - frx, toy - fry   The Distance   subfunction looks like this:  function Distance x, y   {     x = Math.max 1, x      y = Math.max 1, y      return Math.round Math.sqrt Math.abs x * x  + Math.abs y * y     }  The variable x is the length of one short side of the triangle, while y is the length of the   other short side. If either value is 0, then it is changed to 1, otherwise division-by-zero errors  may occur.  Each value is then multiplied by itself to determine the volumes of the squares, and they   are then converted to absolute values, since they could be negative numbers. These figures  are then added together to give their combined volume, which is also the volume of the  square on the long side of the triangle.  Finally, to discover the length of the triangle’s longest side, the square root of this new   volume is returned—the distance in pixels between the locations frx,fry and tox,toy.  With the distance now stored in len1, the values of frx and fry are overridden with   those of the actual coordinates of the object, by looking them up with the X   and Y    plug-ins using the following code. The plug-in will use this new start location, overriding  the one passed to it by the calling code:  frx = X id   fry = Y id       C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    133  The preceding process is then repeated to discover the distance between the new start  location of frx,fry and the final location of tox,toy and this distance is then placed in the  variable len2, like this:  var len2 = Distance tox - frx, toy - fry   It is now possible to adjust the value of msecs  the length of time the animation should   take in milliseconds  by multiplying it by the result of dividing len2 by len1, like this:  For example, if the original length is 240 pixels and the new length is 200 pixels, then the   preceding statement is the equivalent of  msecs *= len2   len1  msecs *= 200   240  or:  msecs *= 0.833  Therefore, the length of time the animation should take will become 833 milliseconds.  This formula also works when the interrupting call discovers that the actual location of the  object is further away than the start position it has specified. If that is the case, msecs will  end up being multiplied by a value larger than 1, which will extend the time that should be  taken.  Determining the Movement Distance for Each Step Next, the plug-in computes the distance between the start and end positions  whether as  originally requested by the calling code, or modified due to interrupting a previous slide   and divides the horizontal and vertical differences into the number of steps required to  make the animation last for the number of milliseconds specified in msecs  which again  could be the original value, or a new value computed from interrupting a previous slide .  The following code calculates these step values:  var stepx =  tox - frx     msecs   INTERVAL   var stepy =  toy - fry     msecs   INTERVAL   To explain how these two lines of code work, I have determined that the value in   INTERVAL  which is 30 by default  is the optimal time in milliseconds between animation  frames. Therefore, the following calculation calculates the number of steps required to make  an animation last msecs milliseconds  if each step happens every INTERVAL milliseconds :   msecs   INTERVAL   Tip  Always ensure you pass the msecs argument a value greater than zero because this plug-in   and all of the animation and transition plug-ins  does not check for it having a value of zero,  which will cause errors and halt the animation.      134   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The distance between the start and end locations is determined by subtracting the end   from the start, as in these two calculations:   tox - frx    toy - fry   If the start is before the end then the result of a calculation is a negative number, otherwise   it is positive. The results are then divided by the result of the previous calculation to divide  the distance by the steps required to determine the amount of movement for each axis, for  each step of animation.   Setting Up the Repeating Interrupts The last four lines of the setup portion of the plug-in set the local variable count to zero; it  will count each step, and inform the plug-in when it’s time to stop. Then the new SL_Int  property of id is set to the value in interruptible. This causes any call that attempts to  interrupt the slide to be prevented unless it has the value true or 1. Next, the new SL_Flag  property of id is given the value true to tell this and any other plug-ins that a slide is  currently in progress on the object id.  Finally, setInterval   is called, passing it the DoSlide function name and the value   in INTERVAL. Because the brackets are left off the end of the function name, the function  itself is passed to setInterval  . If brackets were placed after the name then the result of  calling the DoSlide   function would be passed to setInterval  , which is another  value altogether.  This statement has the effect of initiating an interrupt call to the DoSlide   function every  INTERVAL  30 by default  milliseconds. The value returned by the function is stored in SL_IID   IID stands for Interrupt ID , so that it can be used as an argument to clearInterval   when  the slide has completed  or if it is interrupted . The code to do all this is as follows:  var count     = 0  O id .SL_Int  = interruptible  O id .SL_Flag = true  O id .SL_IID  = setInterval DoSlide, INTERVAL   Performing the Slide The portion of code that performs the animation is the DoSlide   subfunction. Subfunctions  retain access to the main function’s local variables and are, therefore, a neat way to create   a repeating interrupt without having to keep passing the arguments required.  The first thing the subfunction does is call the GoTo   plug-in to move the object to its   next location, as follows:  GoTo id, frx + stepx * count, fry + stepy * count   The two values stepx and stepy were calculated earlier in the plug-in, so this simply  takes the value in frx and adds to it the result of multiplying stepx by count  the current  step number . The same is also calculated for the vertical location.  Next, an if   section of code is entered, in which the value of count is tested against  the result of the calculation msecs   INTERVAL. The current value of count is tested, but       C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    135  the suffix of ++ then increments count after making the test so that it has its new value  ready for the next time the subfunction is called. The statement looks like this:  If count is greater than or equal to msecs   INTERVAL, the object has reached its final  destination and the animation is complete, so the following four lines of code  shown as …  in the previous if   segment  are executed:  if  count++ >=  msecs   INTERVAL    {     …  }  O id .SL_Flag = false  GoTo id, tox, toy   clearInterval O id .SL_IID   if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB   The first line sets the SL_Flag property of id to false to indicate no slide is running on   id. Then a GoTo   call ensures that the object has ended in exactly the correct position, by  passing it the values of tox and toy. This is necessary because the values of stepx and  stepy will usually be floating point numbers and, therefore, the final location as calculated  using them could be a tiny bit off. The tox and toy arguments for this call ensure that any  imprecision is not an issue.  After this, the clearInterval   function is called with an argument of SL_IID, the   property of id that was created from the result of calling setInterval  . This turns off the  repeated interrupts.  Finally, any callback function contained in CB is evaluated with the eval   function,   but only if the argument CB  explained in Chapter 7  has a value.  How To Use It To slide an object from one place to another it must first be released from its default location  by giving its style.position property a value such as ‘absolute’. The following example  moves an object from the coordinates 0,100 to 450,0 over the course of 1500 milliseconds    1.5 seconds :          window.onload = function    {     Position 'globe', ABS      Slide 'globe', 0, 100, 450, 0, 1500, 0   }     The HTML section displays an image and gives it the ID ‘globe’. Then, in the    section, the image is given an ‘absolute’ position using the Position   plug-in and is then  animated with a single call to Slide  . The final argument passed is for whether the  animation is interruptible and, in this case, it is not.      136   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Let’s look at another example that responds to mouse events and allows interruption by   adding a couple of commands to the   section of the previous example:  O 'globe' .onmouseover = function       { Slide this, 450, 0,  450, 50, 500, 1  }  O 'globe' .onmouseout = function       { Slide this, 450, 50, 450, 0,  500, 1  }  Now when you pass the mouse over the globe it will move from the position 450,0 to   450,50. When you move the mouse away, it will slide back to 450,0. As you’ll see, it doesn’t  matter where you interrupt the slide, it always maintains the correct speed. Notice that the  keyword this tells Slide   which object to slide.  However, if you interrupt one slide with another that has a different distance to go or   a different length of time specified, then the interrupted and interrupting speeds will not  match. I recommend you to generally disallow interrupting a slide with a dissimilar one. as  with the first Slide   call in the example, which you cannot interrupt.  The Plug-in function Slide id, frx, fry, tox, toy, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     if  O id .SL_Flag      {        if  !O id .SL_Int  return        else clearInterval O id .SL_IID           var len1  = Distance tox - frx, toy - fry         frx       = X id         fry       = Y id         var len2  = Distance tox - frx, toy - fry         msecs    *= len2   len1     }       var stepx =  tox - frx     msecs   INTERVAL      var stepy =  toy - fry     msecs   INTERVAL        var count     = 0     O id .SL_Int  = interruptible     O id .SL_Flag = true     O id .SL_IID  = setInterval DoSlide, INTERVAL        function Distance x, y      {        x = Math.max 1, x         y = Math.max 1, y         return Math.round Math.sqrt Math.abs x * x  + Math.abs y * y        }       function DoSlide       {        GoTo id, frx + stepx * count, fry + stepy * count                 if  count++ >=  msecs   INTERVAL         C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    137        {           O id .SL_Flag = false           GoTo id, tox, toy            clearInterval O id .SL_IID            if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB         }     }  }    44  SlideBetween   This plug-in is swaps the positions of two objects by sliding them past each other. This is a  great effect for swapping requested objects into a chosen location. For example, Figure 6-2  shows a collection of photos that can be individually displayed by passing the mouse over  the associated title. When you do this, the previous photograph is swapped with the new  one and they slide past each other, the old one returning to the stack of pictures and the new  one moving to the main viewing area.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes the positions of two objects and then swaps the two by sliding the objects  past each other. It takes the following arguments:   	  	  	  id    Either an object, or an object ID—it cannot be an array of objects  msecs    The number of milliseconds the animation should take  interruptible same objects; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the      Figure 6-2  This plug-in creates smooth and impressive swap effects.      138   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  SL_Flag  SL_Int  t1  t2  x1  y1  x2  y2  SB_X  SB_Y  Property of both id1 and id2—true if a slide is in progress Property of both id1 and id2—true if a slide can be interrupted Local temporary variable to store a copy of id1’s SB_X property Local temporary variable to store a copy of id1’s SB_Y property Local temporary variable to store a copy of id1’s SB_X property Local temporary variable to store a copy of id1’s SB_Y property Local temporary variable to store a copy of id2’s SB_X property Local temporary variable to store a copy of id2’s SB_Y property Property of both id1 and id2 containing their horizontal locations Property of both id1 and id2 containing their vertical locations  How It Works This plug-in first checks whether either of the objects passed to it is currently being used in  a slide animation by testing their SL_Flag properties. If so, both objects then have their   SL_Int properties tested. If neither has a value of true or 1, then the slide may not be  interrupted and the function returns. The code to do this is as follows:  if  O id1 .SL_Flag  O id2 .SL_Flag   {     if  !O id1 .SL_Int  !O id2 .SL_Int         return  If the function is interruptible, then the locations of each object require swapping so that   they can return to their start locations. This behavior has been chosen because the only details  passed to the plug-in are the object IDs. Therefore, if an interrupting call to SlideBetween    is requested on an object, the only different action it can take is to reverse the current slide.  To do this, the temporary variables t1 and t2 are given the current horizontal and  vertical locations of id1. Then id1 is given the position of id2. Finally, id2 is given the  position stored in t1 and t2, using the following statements:  var t1      = O id1 .SB_X  var t2      = O id1 .SB_Y  O id1 .SB_X = O id2 .SB_X  O id1 .SB_Y = O id2 .SB_Y  O id2 .SB_X = t1  O id2 .SB_Y = t2  else  {     O id1 .SB_X = X id1      O id1 .SB_Y = Y id1    If a slide is not currently in progress on either object, copies are made of the current   horizontal and locations of each object. These are created as new properties of each object  rather  than local variables  so that interrupting calls  if allowed  can have access to them, as follows:      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    139     O id2 .SB_X = X id2      O id2 .SB_Y = Y id2   }  var x1 = O id1 .SB_X  var y1 = O id1 .SB_Y  var x2 = O id2 .SB_X  var y2 = O id2 .SB_Y  are as follows:  Next, although not necessary, temporary copies are made of the locations of each object  in the short named variables x1, x2, y1, and y2. This is so that the final two statements are  easier to read and can fit on single lines. The four lines that do it look like this:  The final statements that start the animations going with calls to the Slide   plug-in   Slide id1, x1, y1, x2, y2, msecs, interruptible, CB   Slide id2, x2, y2, x1, y1, msecs, interruptible, CB   The first statement sets up id1 to move from its location to that of id2, and the second   sets id2 up to move from its location to that of id1.  How To Use It There are many ways you can use this plug-in. All you need is a single line of code to  smoothly swap two objects, like the following, which swaps object1 and object2 by  sliding them past each other over the course of 1000 milliseconds  1 second :  SlideBetween object1, object2, 1000, 0   The final argument of 0 specifies that the animation may not be interrupted and must   Here’s an example of how you could use this plug-in to create a simple but effective   proceed until it completes.  way to display photographs:  Choose a photo:   Landscape ,   Museum ,   Parrots ,   Steps ,   Pyramid                                             140   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        window.onload = function    {     Locate Array 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5' , 'absolute',  2, 50      Locate 'p1', ABS, 330, 50      Locate 'p2', ABS, 335, 55      Locate 'p3', ABS, 340, 60      Locate 'p4', ABS, 345, 65      Locate 'p5', ABS, 350, 70        swap 'm1', 'p1', 'b1'      swap 'm2', 'p2', 'b2'      swap 'm3', 'p3', 'b3'      swap 'm4', 'p4', 'b4'      swap 'm5', 'p5', 'b5'        function swap o1, o2, o3      {        O o1 .onmouseover = function   { SlideBetween o2, o3, 200, 1  }        O o1 .onmouseout  = function   { SlideBetween o2, o3, 200, 1  }     }  }     The HTML section of this example displays some text and five headings that describe   five photographs. Each heading is given an ID and placed in its own span tag. Underneath  this, five empty divs are created with unique IDs. These will be used as objects with which  to swap the photographs. Finally, the photographs are displayed, with each one having a  unique ID assigned to it.  In the   section, the first statement sets all the blank divs to have a position   property of ‘absolute’ and places them all at the location 2,50. Then the photos are also made  ‘absolute’ and placed in their locations. I chose to give them slightly different coordinates to  show them as a stack of images.  After this, five calls to a new function called swap   are made to attach to the image’s   mouse events. The swap   function takes three arguments, o1, o2, and o3, for the three objects  passed to it. The o1 object is one of the heading divs, which then has its onmouseover and  onmouseout events attached to by inline, anonymous functions that call the SlideBetween    plug-in, passing o2 and o3  the two objects to swap  to it, and a time period of 200 milliseconds  that the swap should take.  All this has the effect of swapping a photo with its blank companion div when the mouse   passes over its heading. It swaps them back when the mouse passes out of the heading.  Because the final argument passed to SlideBetween   is a 1, the animations are interruptible,  so if you move the mouse away before a picture has finished sliding, it will simply slide back to  its position in the stack of images.  I have deliberately only given you the guts of how this works so you can see how to   easily create your own functions. With suitable CSS and graphics, you can use these  techniques to create very impressive dynamic effects.

You can also specify whether to deflate  or shrink  the width, height, or both. Figure 6-3  shows three images, each of which is in the process of being deflated with this plug-in. The  first is shrinking horizontally, the last vertically, and the middle one is deflating in both  dimensions.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object and over a specified time period shrinks it down until it is no  longer visible. The following are the required arguments:   	 w 	 h 	  id        An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will shrink If true or 1, the object’s height will shrink      142   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 6-3  Three different types of deflation supported by this plug-in   	  	  msecs    The number of milliseconds the animation should take  interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the      Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  stepw  steph  width  height  overflow  DF_Flag  DF_Int  DF_IID  DF_OldW  DF_OldH  DF_Count  Deflated  Local variable to index into id if it is an array Local variable containing the amount of horizontal change per frame Local variable containing the amount of vertical change per frame Local variable containing the width to which id should be changed at  each step Local variable containing the height to which id should be changed  at each step The object’s style.overflow object, which is set to HID  ‘hidden’   to prevent an object’s contents overflowing as it shrinks Property of id that is true if a Deflate   call is in progress Property of id containing true if the deflation is interruptible Property of id used to clear an interrupt with clearInterval   Property of id containing the unshrunk width of id Property of id containing the unshrunk height of id Property if id that counts the number of frames in the animation Property of id set to true if it has been deflated—used by the  DeflateToggle   plug-in      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    143  INTERVAL  HID  setInterval    clearInterval    DoDeflate    W    H    Resize    Global variable with the value 30 Global variable with the value ‘hidden’ Function to set up repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Subfunction to perform the animation Plug-in to fetch an object’s width Plug-in to fetch an object’s height Plug-in to resize an object  How It Works This plug-in has a few different parts. The first part tests whether id is an array; if it is, it  calls itself recursively with each element of id using the following code:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         Deflate id[j], w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB      return  }  This allows many objects to be deflated at once, as long as they are passed to Deflate     in an array.  Next, the code has to take into account the fact that when only one dimension of an   image is changed, most browsers will automatically modify the other one to keep the image  at the same aspect ratio. However, in this case that feature is not wanted, so if either the  horizontal or vertical width is not to be changed  as decided by the values in the w and h  arguments , that dimension is given a fixed value representing its current length to replace  its default value of ‘auto’. This allows one dimension to be altered and the other will not  change:  if  !w  ResizeWidth  id, W id    if  !h  ResizeHeight id, H id    Next, if a deflate animation is already in progress on id  as determined by its DF_Flag  property having a value of true or 1 , its DF_Int property is checked. This contains true or  1 if the animation may be interrupted; if it is not true or 1, the function returns. Otherwise, if  any deflate interrupt is currently running, it is stopped with a call to clearInterval  . The  code for these two actions is as follows:  if  O id .DF_Flag   {     if  !O id .DF_Int  return     else clearInterval O id .DF_IID   }      144   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Otherwise, if this is the first time the id object has been used by the Deflate   plug-in,   there are some properties that need assigning, as follows:  else  {     if  w  O id .DF_OldW  = W id      if  h  O id .DF_OldH  = H id      O id .DF_Count = msecs   INTERVAL  }  In this section, the properties DF_OldW and DF_OldH are assigned the current width and  height of the object so that they can be restored later—but only those dimensions that are to  be resized have this value saved.  Also, the DF_Count property is assigned the result of msecs   INTERVAL, which is the  number of steps in the animation. This variable will later count down one step at a time to  zero  in the DoDeflate   subfunction , and each time its value will be multiplied by the  values in stepw and or steph to calculate the correct width and or height of id for each  step of the animation.  Next, some properties have to be assigned a certain value  whether or not this is the first   time id has been used with this plug-in  by the following statements:  var stepw = O id .DF_OldW    msecs   INTERVAL   var steph = O id .DF_OldH    msecs   INTERVAL     S id .overflow = HID  O id .Deflated = true  O id .DF_Flag  = true  O id .DF_Int   = interruptible  O id .DF_IID   = setInterval DoDeflate, INTERVAL   First, the horizontal and vertical distances for each step of the animation are assigned to  stepw and steph. This determines the amount of horizontal and vertical shrinkage required  in each step to ensure the animation lasts msecs milliseconds.  The next statement ensures that the contents of the id object will not overflow its   boundaries during resizing by setting the style.overflow property of id to HID  which  stands for ‘hidden’ . This is not an issue when resizing images, but it certainly is when the  object is a div or span that contains multiple items such as text and images.  The Deflated property is then set to true to indicate the object’s current deflated   inflated state to this and other plug-ins, such as DeflateToggle  . The DF_Flag is also set  to true to tell this and any other plug-ins that a Deflate   call is now in progress on id.  Next, DF_Int is given the value in interruptible so that if the plug-in is called again  on id while the animation is still running, this value can be tested and, if not true or 1, the  plug-in will not be interrupted.   The final statement in this part of the code uses setInterval   to set up an interrupt  call to DoDeflate   every INTERVAL milliseconds. The result of making this call is a value  that can later be passed to clearInterval   to cancel the interrupts. It is saved in the   DF_IID property of id.      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    145  The DoDeflate   Subfunction Once initialized by the main part of the plug-in, the DoDeflate   subfunction is called  every INTERVAL milliseconds, and each time it shrinks the object a little more, like this:  if  w  ResizeWidth  id, stepw * O id .DF_Count    if  h  ResizeHeight id, steph * O id .DF_Count   These two lines calculate the new width and or height of id and then resize either or   both.  Next, a check is made to see if this was the final resize and whether the animation can   now stop. This is done by checking the value of DF_Count, which is decremented after each  frame of animation.  When the Animation Is Finished If the DF_Count property is less than 1, the animation has completed and the DF_Flag  property of id is set to false to indicate that there is now no deflate operation running   on id.   Finally, the width and or height of the dimension s  being resized are set to zero to   complete the transition.  In the final two lines of the plug-in, the clearInterval   function is called to prevent  any further interrupts. Any callback function contained in CB is evaluated with the eval    function, but only if the argument CB  explained in Chapter 7  has a value. The code for  these actions is as follows:  if  O id .DF_Count-- < 1   {     O id .DF_Flag = false       if  w  ResizeWidth id, 0      if  h  ResizeHeight id, 0        clearInterval O id .DF_IID      if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB   }  Tip  The double-hyphen  --  operator following DF_Count is a handy way of telling JavaScript to   decrement the variable, but only after its current value has been used in the if   statement,  thus saving an extra line of code.  How To Use It Using deflate   is a great way to make an object disappear smoothly and is much more  fun than just fading it out or hiding it. Here’s some example code illustrating the three  different types of effects supported by this plug-in:   Mouseover Me                     146   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        window.onload = function    {     Locate 'p1', ABS, 0,   0      Locate 'p2', ABS, 160, 0      Locate 'p3', ABS, 320, 0      Deflate 'p1', 1, 0, 2000, 0      Deflate 'p2', 1, 1, 2000, 0      Deflate 'p3', 0, 1, 2000, 0   }     The HTML section of this example places three images on the screen and assigns them   unique IDs. The   section then uses the Locate   plug-in to give them all a position  of ‘absolute’ and places them overlapping each other, along the top of the browser.  The final three lines call up a different Deflate   effect on each, which is achieved by  passing different values of the second and third parameters. The first image shrinks only in  a horizontal direction because the two width and height parameters are 1 and 0. The middle  image has width and height parameters of 1 and 1, so it shrinks in both directions. The last  image has width and height parameters of 0 and 1 and shrinks only in a vertical direction. The final two parameters of 2000 and 0 cause the animations to take 2000 milliseconds   each  although they run concurrently , and the 0 specifies that they are not interruptible.  The Plug-in function Deflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            Deflate id[j], w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  !w  ResizeWidth  id, W id       if  !h  ResizeHeight id, H id         if  O id .DF_Flag      {        if  !O id .DF_Int  return        else clearInterval O id .DF_IID      }     else     {        if  w  O id .DF_OldW  = W id         if  h  O id .DF_OldH  = H id         O id .DF_Count = msecs   INTERVAL     }          var stepw = O id .DF_OldW    msecs   INTERVAL      var steph = O id .DF_OldH    msecs   INTERVAL          C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    147     S id .overflow = HID     O id .Deflated = true     O id .DF_Flag  = true     O id .DF_Int   = interruptible     O id .DF_IID   = setInterval DoDeflate, INTERVAL           function DoDeflate       {        if  w  ResizeWidth  id, stepw * O id .DF_Count          if  h  ResizeHeight id, steph * O id .DF_Count           if  O id .DF_Count-- < 1         {           O id .DF_Flag = false           if  w  ResizeWidth  id, 0            if  h  ResizeHeight id, 0            clearInterval O id .DF_IID            if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB         }     }  }    46  Reflate   This is the companion plug-in to Deflate  . With it, you can expand a deflated object back  to its original dimensions over a specified period of time, with a choice of three different  animation types. In Figure 6-4, a div has been added to the example in the Deflate     plug-in with which you can deflate or reflate the objects.  Figure 6-4  Both the plug-ins Deflate   and Reflate   are attached to mouse events.      148   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object  or an array of objects  and reinflates it to its original dimensions  after it was deflated using the Deflate   plug-in. You can call this plug-in only on objects  that have been previously deflated, otherwise the call will be ignored. It takes the following  arguments:    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will expand to its original value If true or 1, the object’s height will expand to its original value    The number of milliseconds the animation should take  id     msecs   	 w 	 h 	  	  	  interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the      Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  stepw  steph  width  height  DF_Flag  DF_Int  DF_IID  DF_OldW  DF_OldH  DF_Count  Deflated  INTERVAL  setInterval    clearInterval    DoReflate    Resize    Local variable to index into id if it is an array Local variable containing the amount of horizontal change per frame Local variable containing the amount of vertical change per frame Local variable containing the width to which id should be changed  at each step Local variable containing the height to which id should be changed  at each step Property of id that is true if a Deflate   call is in progress Property of id containing true if the deflation is interruptible Property of id that clears an interrupt with clearInterval   Property of id containing the unshrunk width of id Property of id containing the unshrunk height of id Property of id that counts the number of frames in the animation Property of id set to true if it has been deflated—used by the  DeflateToggle   plug-in Global variable with the value 30 Function to set up repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Subfunction to perform the animation Plug-in to resize an object      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    149  How It Works This plug-in works in a very similar way to the Deflate   plug-in with two main differences.  First, if the Deflated property of id is not true, the plug-in returns because the object cannot  be reinflated. Here is the piece of code that does that:  if  !O id .Deflated  return  Second, instead of DF_Count counting down from the maximum step count to zero, it  counts upward from 0 and so is initialized to a value of zero in this plug-in  as opposed to  the value it is assigned with msecs   INTERVAL in the Deflate   plug-in . The DoReflate    subfunction uses the following statement to increment the DF_Count property each frame of  the animation  instead of decrementing, as in the DoDeflate   subfunction of Deflate   :  if  O id .DF_Count++ >= msecs   INTERVAL   The Deflated property of id that indicates whether an object is deflated or inflated is  set to false by this plug-in  rather than true, as with Deflate   , but the rest of the code  is virtually the same, so please read the details on Deflate   for further details.  How To Use It You should call this plug-in on an object only after the object has been deflated using the  Deflate   plug-in. If you try to use it on an object that hasn’t yet been deflated, the plug-in  will simply return.  The following example is expanded from the one in the Deflate   plug-in section.    It has a div inserted before the images that you can pass the mouse over to either deflate or  reflate the images:   Mouseover Me                   window.onload = function    {     Locate 'p1', ABS, 0,   30      Locate 'p2', ABS, 160, 30      Locate 'p3', ABS, 320, 30        O 'd' .onmouseover = down     O 'd' .onmouseout  = up       function down       {        Deflate 'p1', 1, 0, 2000, 1         Deflate 'p2', 1, 1, 2000, 1         Deflate 'p3', 0, 1, 2000, 1      }         150   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        function up       {        Reflate 'p1', 1, 0, 2000, 1         Reflate 'p2', 1, 1, 2000, 1         Reflate 'p3', 0, 1, 2000, 1      }  }      This example replaces the direct calls to the Deflate   plug-in with a pair of new  functions, down   and up  . These are attached to the onmouseover and onmouseout  events of the span displaying the text “Mouseover Me”, so that when you move the mouse  over the text the objects deflate, and when you move it away, they inflate.  The calls to the two plug-ins have their final parameter set to 1. This is the interruptible  argument, and, therefore, interrupting of the plug-ins has been enabled. This means that the  example is very responsive and the animations occur immediately upon moving the mouse  in or out of the span, taking into account the current amount of deflation or reflation to  smoothly inverse the previous animation.  The Plug-in function Reflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            Reflate id[j], w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  !O id .Deflated  return     else if  O id .DF_Flag      {        if  !O id .DF_Int  return        else clearInterval O id .DF_IID      }     else O id .DF_Count = 0       var stepw  = O id .DF_OldW    msecs   INTERVAL      var steph  = O id .DF_OldH    msecs   INTERVAL        O id .DF_Flag  = true     O id .Deflated = false     O id .DF_Int   = interruptible     O id .DF_IID   = setInterval DoReflate, INTERVAL        function DoReflate       {        if  w  ResizeWidth  id, stepw * O id .DF_Count          if  h  ResizeHeight id, steph * O id .DF_Count           if  O id .DF_Count++ >= msecs   INTERVAL        C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    151        {           O id .DF_Flag = false           if  w  ResizeWidth  id, O id .DF_OldW            if  h  ResizeHeight id, O id .DF_OldH            clearInterval O id .DF_IID            if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB         }     }  }    47  DeflateToggle   If you use this plug-in, you don’t need to keep track of which objects have or haven’t been  deflated, and it saves on extra code, too. In Figure 6-5 the example in the Reflate   plug- in section has been updated to use this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in toggles an object between being deflated or inflated. It takes the following  arguments:    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will deflate or reflate If true or 1, the object’s height will deflate or reflate    The number of milliseconds the animation should take  id     msecs   	 w 	 h 	  	  	  interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the      Figure 6-5  The images automatically toggle between being inflated and deflated.      152   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  Deflated  Deflate    Reflate    Local variable for indexing into id if it is an array Property of id that is true if id is deflated Plug-in to deflate an object to 0 width by 0 height Plug-in to reflate an object to its original dimensions  How It Works This plug-in uses the standard recursive techniques of many of the others to determine  whether id is an array and if it is, to pass each element of the array recursively back to the  same function to be dealt with individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         DeflateToggle id[j], w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB      return  }  After that there are just two statements, the first of which tests the Deflated property   of id. If it is true, the object has been  or is in the process of being  deflated, so the  Reflate   plug-in is called. Otherwise, the object is inflated  or is in the process of being  reinflated , so the Deflate   plug-in is called, like this:  if  O id .Deflated  Reflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   else                Deflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   How To Use It You can use this plug-in to replace having to call both of the Deflate   and Reflate    plug-ins and to save having to track their deflated inflated states. The following code is  similar to the previous example in the Reflate   section, except that it is shorter because it  uses DeflateToggle   instead of both the Deflate   and Reflate   plug-ins:   Mouseover Me                   window.onload = function    {     Locate 'p1', ABS, 0,   30      Locate 'p2', ABS, 160, 30      Locate 'p3', ABS, 320, 30      Deflate 'p2', 1, 0, 1, 1        O 'd' .onmouseover = toggle     O 'd' .onmouseout  = toggle         C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    153     function toggle       {        DeflateToggle 'p1', 1, 1, 2000, 1         DeflateToggle 'p2', 1, 0, 2000, 1         DeflateToggle 'p3', 0, 1, 2000, 1      }  }     For variety, I added a call to Deflate   just after those to the Locate   plug-in so that  the second picture will start off deflated. Notice that I passed a value of 1 millisecond for the  call  the fastest allowed  so that, for all intents and purposes, it is instant.  Try passing your mouse in and out of the Mouseover Me text and watch how the   pictures toggle their deflated inflated states as you do so, smoothly changing between each  animation type as soon as you move the cursor in and out.  To become fully acquainted with what this plug-in can do for you, you might want    to change the animation length from 2000 milliseconds to other values, change the  interruptible argument to 0, change the animation types by varying the w and h  parameters, or use different images in varying locations.  Tip  Remember that the second and third arguments  w and h, which specify whether the width and  or height is to be modified  must be the same for all deflates, inflates, and toggles on an object for  it to correctly deflate and inflate. For example, if you deflate just the width of an object and then  try to inflate just its height then nothing will happen since the height has not been deflated. In  this case only the object’s width can be inflated.  The Plug-in function DeflateToggle id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            DeflateToggle id[j], w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  O id .Deflated  Reflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB      else                Deflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   }    48  DeflateBetween   This plug-in provides similar functionality to the FadeBetween   plug-in, except that it  resizes a pair of objects in a choice of three different ways  height, width, or width and  height , rather than simply fading from one to the other. This plug-in is good for creating  professional slideshow effects, or for swapping content. In Figure 6-6, two images have been       154   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 6-6  Swapping two objects by deflating one and inflating the other  overlaid on each other and, while the larger one deflates, the smaller picture inflates and  will soon be as large as the original image, which will have disappeared by the time the  original smaller picture reaches that size.  About the Plug-in This plug-in swaps two objects by deflating one and inflating the other at the same time. It  requires these arguments:    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs   An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will deflate or reflate If true or 1, the object’s height will deflate or reflate    The number of milliseconds the animation should take  id1  id2     msecs   	  	 w 	 h 	  	  	  interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the      Variables, Arrays, and Functions  Deflate    Reflate    Plug-in to deflate an object to zero width and height Plug-in to reinflate and object to its previous dimensions  How It Works This plug-in simply makes one call to Deflate   for the first object and another to Reflate    for the second.      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    155  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you need to ensure that the second object has already been deflated.  Ideally, you will have also released each object from its position in the HTML by giving it   a position style of ‘absolute’ or ‘relative’. You will probably also have overlaid the objects on  each other.  The following example does all of this and features a span that you can pass your mouse   over to initiate the swaps:   Mouseover Me                window.onload = function    {     Locate Array 'p1', 'p2' , ABS, 0, 30      Deflate 'p2', 1, 1, 1, 0        O 'd' .onmouseover = swap1     O 'd' .onmouseout  = swap2       function swap1       {        DeflateBetween 'p1', 'p2', 1, 1, 1000, 1      }       function swap2       {        DeflateBetween 'p2', 'p1', 1, 1, 1000, 1      }  }     The HTML section creates a span with the text “Mouseover Me” and also displays two   images, All three items are given unique IDs.  In the   section, both of the images are given a position style setting of   ‘absolute’ and located at 0 pixels across, and 30 down using calls to the Locate   plug-in.  The second image is then deflated using the Deflate   plug-in, over the shortest time  possible  1 millisecond , which is virtually instantaneous.  Finally, the onmouseover and onmouseout events of the div are attached, in order, to  the swap1   and swap2   functions, which call the DeflateBetween   plug-in to either  swap from image 1 to image 2, or from image 2 to image 1.  The transitions are given 1000 milliseconds  or 1 second  to complete. Because the   interruptible parameter is set to 1, you can pass your mouse in and out of the Mouseover  Me text to instantly change between displaying one image or the other.  You may want to try changing the w and h arguments to see the various different effects   you can achieve.      156   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Plug-in function DeflateBetween id1, id2, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   {     Deflate id1, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB      Reflate id2, w, h, msecs, interruptible, CB   }    49  Zoom   This plug-in is similar in some ways to the Deflate   and Reflate   plug-ins but it can  do much more, including zooming in and out using the center of an object as the focus,  padding margins during zooms to retain the same width and height  ensuring other objects  don’t get disturbed by the resizing , and specifying end widths and heights.  In Figure 6-7, four icons are displayed, each of which is attached by its mouse events to   the Zoom   plug-in so that when the mouse passes over them they enlarge, and when it  moves away they shrink back down. In the figure the second icon is currently zoomed up.  About the Plug-in This plug-in will zoom an object over a period of time between two supplied sets of width  and height. It can also pad the object to retain its overall dimensions and supports three  different styles of zoom. It requires the following arguments:  id     fromw  fromh   	 w 	 h 	  	  	  	    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will be zoomed If true or 1, the object’s height will be zoomed    The width from which the object should be zoomed   The height from which the object should be zoomed  tow    The width to which the object should be zoomed  Figure 6-7  Zooming icons when the mouse passes over them      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    157   	  	  	   	  toh    The height to which the object should be zoomed  msecs    The number of milliseconds the animation should take If greater than 0, the object will be padded with CSS padding  so that it     pad always keeps the same dimensions ; otherwise, if it is –1, no padding is required  and id may not be moved during a zoom. If pad is 0 or null then, as well as not  applying padding, the object will be moved during resizing so as to remain  centered. interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the      Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  tox  toy  midx  midy  width1  width2  height1  height2  stepw  steph  INTERVAL  HID  ZO_W  ZO_H  ZO_Flag  ZO_Int  ZO_Count  ZO_IID  Local variable for indexing into id if it is an array Local variable containing the final horizontal offset Local variable containing the final vertical offset Local variable containing the horizontal center offset Local variable containing the vertical center offset Local variable containing the amount of padding for the left of   the object Copy of width1 containing the amount of padding for the right of   the object Local variable containing the amount of padding for the top of   the object Copy of height1 containing the amount of padding for the bottom  of the object Local variable containing the amount of change in width for each  step Local variable containing the amount of change in height for   each step Global variable containing the value 30 Global variable containing the value ‘hidden’ Property of id containing its current width Property of id containing its current height Property of id set to true if a zoom is in progress Property of id set to true if a zoom may be interrupted Property of id containing the current frame number of the animation Property of id containing the value required to cancel the interrupts  with clearInterval        158   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     paddingLeft  paddingTop  paddingRight  paddingBottom  overflow  setInterval    clearInterval    Math.max    Math.floor    Math.round    DoZoom    ZoomPad    NoPx    Px    W    H    X    Y    GoTo    Resize    The style.paddingLeft property of id The style.paddingTop property of id The style.paddingRight property of id The style.paddingBottom property of id The style.overflow property of id Function to start repeated interrupts to another function Function to stop repeated interrupts Function to return the maximum out of two values Function to remove any numbers after the decimal point in a floating  point number and return an integer Function to round a floating point number either up or down to the  nearest integer Subfunction to perform the zoom animation Subfunction to pad an object while zooming so that it retains the  same dimensions Plug-in to remove the ‘px’ suffix of a property Plug-in to add the ‘px’ suffix to a value Plug-in to return an object’s width Plug-in to return an object’s height Plug-in to return an object’s horizontal offset Plug-in to return an object’s vertical offset Plug-in to move an object to a new location Plug-in to resize the dimensions of an object  How It Works This plug-in is quite long because it has to achieve a number of different objectives, but if  you follow this explanation you’ll see how it breaks down into easily digestible chunks.  However, you don’t need to understand how this function works if you just want to use it,  so please don’t be put off by this extended commentary.  You should be fully familiar with the first section of code by now because it checks   whether id is an array, and if it is, passes each element recursively to the same function to  be dealt with individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         Zoom id[j], w, h, fromw, fromh, tow, toh,           msecs, pad, interruptible, CB      return  }      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    159  After this, copies of the object’s current x and y coordinates need saving  if they haven’t   already been saved , like this:  if  typeof O id .ZO_X == UNDEF   {     O id .ZO_X = X id      O id .ZO_Y = Y id   }  The typeof operator checks whether the property ZO_X is already defined; if it isn’t, it   assigns values it and the property ZO_Y, taken from the plug-ins X   and Y  .  If a Zoom Is Not Currently in Progress Next, the plug-in checks whether a zoom is currently in progress on id by looking at its   ZO_Flag property. If a zoom is not in progress, then three variables require initializing prior  to starting the zoom, as follows:  if  !O id .ZO_Flag   {     O id .ZO_W     = Math.max fromw, tow      O id .ZO_H     = Math.max fromh, toh      O id .ZO_Count = 0  }   The first two statements assign whichever value is larger out of the start and destination   widths and heights in fromw, tow, fromh, and toh to the ZO_W and ZO_H properties of id.  This sets default values for the width and height of a zoom should only one of the dimensions  be set to change  therefore, the nonchanging dimension will retain this value . The ZO_Count  property is also initialized to zero.  If a Zoom Is in Progress If  a zoom is in progress, the ZO_Int property is inspected. If it is not true, the plug-in may  not be interrupted, so it returns. Next, the repeating interrupts are stopped by calling the  clearInterval   function. Also, because the only useful action an interrupt can do to a  zoom in progress is to reverse the direction of zooming, the ZO_Count property of id is set  to its inverse. Here is the section of code that does this:  else  {     if  !O id .ZO_Int  return     else clearInterval O id .ZO_IID        O id .ZO_Count =  msecs   INTERVAL  - O id .ZO_Count  }  If the zoom can’t be interrupted then the plug-in returns. Otherwise the current repeating   interrupts are cancelled.  The final statement is based on the result of msecs   INTERVAL being the number of  steps required to make the zoom last for msecs milliseconds. Therefore, if the ZO_Count  property has a value of 10 out of 34  for example , then for the zoom to reverse there will be  only 10 steps remaining to return to the starting zoom level.       160   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Setting Up the Variables After this, a few local variables require setting up  whether or not a zoom is currently running ,  using this code:  var maxw  = Math.max fromw, tow   var maxh  = Math.max fromh, toh   var stepw =  tow - fromw     msecs   INTERVAL   var steph =  toh - fromh     msecs   INTERVAL   The first two statements use the Math.max   function to determine the maximum   width and height an object will be at either the start or end of the zoom, and places these  values in maxw and maxh. Then the horizontal and vertical distance between each frame of  the zoom is calculated and placed in stepw and steph.  The last four statements of the initial setup process are these:  S id .overflow = HID  O id .ZO_Flag  = true  O id .ZO_Int   = interruptible  O id .ZO_IID   = setInterval DoZoom, INTERVAL   The first one ensures that the object will not overflow outside its boundaries if it is made   smaller than the contents. This isn’t applicable to images but must be done for objects such  as divs and spans that can contain many different elements. The overflowing is prevented  by setting id’s style.overflow property to the value in HID, which is ‘hidden’.  Next, the ZO_Flag property is set to true to indicate to this and other plug-ins that a zoom  is in progress on id. The ZO_Int property is also assigned the value in interruptible, which  will be true if this zoom can be interrupted.  Finally, the setInterval   function is called in such a way that the DoZoom   subfunction  will be called every INTERVAL milliseconds. The result returned by the function is placed in  ZO_IID so that it can later be used to cancel the interrupts using a call to clearInterval  .  The DoZoom   Subfunction The job of the DoZoom   subfunction is to perform the resizing required by changing the  object’s dimensions just a little each time it is called. The first three lines calculate the new  width and height and perform the resizing as follows:  if  w  O id .ZO_W = Math.round fromw + stepw * O id .ZO_Count   if  h  O id .ZO_H = Math.round fromh + steph * O id .ZO_Count   Resize id, O id .ZO_W, O id .ZO_H   In the first line, if the argument w is true, then horizontal resizing is allowed so the ZO_W   property of id is assigned the new value required for the object’s width. This value is  calculated by multiplying stepw  the amount of change for each step of the animation  by  ZO_Count  the number of this animation step  and adding it to the value of the fromw  argument  the original width of the object . If the zoom is reducing id, then a negative value  is added to fromw, otherwise a positive value is added.  The second line does exactly the same, but for the object’s height and places the result in   id’s ZO_H property. If either w or h is not true, then that dimension is not to be resized  during the zoom, and the value previously assigned to either the ZO_W or ZO_H property       C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    161  earlier in the plug-in will be the default used. The third line performs the resizing by calling  the Resize   plug-in.  After this, the values required to center the object are placed in midx and midy, like this:  var midx = O id .ZO_X + Math.round  maxw - O id .ZO_W    2   var midy = O id .ZO_Y + Math.round  maxh - O id .ZO_H    2   These are calculated by taking the maximum width and height of the object and then  subtracting its current width and height from them. These values are then divided by 2 to  obtain the offset from the top left of the object, which has been stored in the ZO_X and ZO_T  properties of id.  When the Pad Argument Is True If the pad argument is greater than zero, the calling code of this plug-in will pad out id as it  changes dimensions so that it will retain the same overall size, and, therefore, elements  resting against it will also stay aligned where they are. Without this setting, as the width  and height of id changes, any objects surrounding it might move about to take the new  dimensions into account. The following line of code calls the ZoomPad   subfunction to  create the padding required:  if  pad > 0  ZoomPad Math.max fromw, tow ,     Math.max fromh, toh , O id .ZO_W, O id .ZO_H   This finds the maximum width and height that the object will be out of its start and end   values of fromw, tow, fromh, and toh, by using the Math.max   function. The object will  then have its padding adjusted so that if it is going to zoom larger, padding is placed  around it in advance, into which the resizing can grow. Or, if it will be reducing, then no  padding is added, but as the object reduces, more and more padding is added to make up  for the reduction in size. The overall result is that when pad is greater than zero, id will  always have the same overall dimensions  when you add its width and height to its  padding .  Otherwise, if pad doesn’t have a value of –1, id is moved to keep it centered  if pad    is –1, no padding is required and no moving of id is wanted .  If This Plug-in Has Been Called by the DockBar   Plug-in Next, there’s an interesting piece of code used only by the DockBar   plug-in, covered in  Chapter 8. It looks like this:  else if  O id .DB_Parent      GoToEdge O id .DB_Parent, O id .DB_Where, 50   This code examines the DB_Parent property of id. If it is true, the plug-in has been   called from DockBar  , in which case the GoToEdge   plug-in from Chapter 4 is called to  keep id up against the edge to which it has been assigned by the value in the DB_Where  property.  If this plug-in isn’t being used as part of the DockBar   plug-in, then it’s necessary to  keep id centered  unless the pad argument is –1, in which case centering is disabled . Of  course, if id has not been lifted up from the page by making it have an ‘absolute’, ‘relative’,  or other position style property, then any attempt to change its location will be ignored  in  which case the best way to keep the object centered is to set pad to true .      162   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     However, if the object does have a set x and y coordinate, then each time it reduces or   enlarges, its top left corner will require moving slightly to keep its center in the middle,  although an object that is using padding will not change position as it will always have the  same overall dimensions.  When the Animation Has Completed To check whether the zoom has completed, the following if   statement is used:  if  ++O id .ZO_Count >=  msecs   INTERVAL    This statement increments the ZO_Count property of id and then checks whether it is   greater than or equal to the result of msecs   INTERVAL  which gives the number of steps  in the animation . If it isn’t, then the contents of the if   statement are ignored and the  subfunction returns and will be called up again in INTERVAL milliseconds time. Otherwise, the zoom has finished and the following statements are executed:  var endx      = O id .ZO_X + Math.round  maxw - tow    2   var endy      = O id .ZO_Y + Math.round  maxh - toh    2   O id .ZO_Flag = false  Resize id, tow, toh   clearInterval O id .ZO_IID   The first two lines calculate the final top x and y locations for the object and place them  in endx and endy. The next line sets the ZO_Flag property of id to false to indicate that  no zoom is running on id. Next, the object is resized to its final width and height in tow and  toh, and the repeating interrupts are stopped by calling clearInterval  , passing it the  property ZO_IID that was stored when setInterval   was called.  After this, if padding is being used, ZoomPad   is called to update the padding;   otherwise, if pad is not –1, the GoTo   plug-in is called to ensure that id is located exactly  at its final position in endx and endy:  if  pad > 0  ZoomPad fromw, fromh, tow, toh   else if  pad != -1  GoTo id, endx, endy   Then, if this plug-in is being called by the DockBar   plug-in, id is moved to its final   place at the required edge:  if  O id .DB_Parent  GoToEdge O id .DB_Parent, O id .DB_Where, 50   The final statement checks whether the CB argument has been passed, and if so it calls   eval   to execute it, as explained in Chapter 7:  if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB   The ZoomPad   Subfunction The ZoomPad   subfunction applies sufficient CSS padding to id in order to ensure that the  object always has the same overall dimensions. It takes four arguments, frw, frh, padw, and  padh. The variables frw and frh contain the initial width and height of id, and padw and  padh contain the overall required width and height for id.      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    163  Therefore, if frw is less than padw or frh is less than padh,  some padding must be  applied. This is calculated by subtracting padw from frw and padh from frh. Along the  way, padw and padh are passed through the Math.round   function to return integer  values.  Then left and top are given the new padding width and height to be given to the left  and top of id. The variables right and bottom are also assigned these values, which will  apply the padding width and height to the right and bottom of id. This is the code used,  which simply divides each padding value by two:  var left   = Math.max 0, frw - Math.round padw     2  var right  = left  var top    = Math.max 0, frh - Math.round padh     2  var bottom = top  If the amount of padding to add to either the width or height of id is an odd number,   then left and or top  being half that number  will have a fractional part of .5.  For example, if 5 pixels width padding is required, then left will have a value of 2.5, as   will right. This is because left contains the padding to add to one side of id, right  contains the amount to add to the other, top contains the amount of padding to add to the  top, and bottom contains the amount to add to the bottom of id.  However, because most browsers don’t allow floating point values for these properties    although, strangely, some do , left is compared with the value of Math.floor left ,  which returns the value passed to it, less any fractional part. So if left has a value of 2.5,  Math.floor left  returns 2.  Therefore, if the following code finds that left does have a fractional part, it removes it   and then gives that value plus 1 to right so that, in the current example, if left was 2.5  then now it will have a value of 2, and right will be 3:  The next five lines of code are the same, except they set up top and bottom padding   if  left != Math.floor left    {     left  = Math.floor left      right = left + 1  }  amounts, like this:  if  top != Math.floor top    {     top    = Math.floor top      bottom = top + 1  }  S id .paddingLeft   = Px left   S id .paddingRight  = Px right   S id .paddingTop    = Px top   S id .paddingBottom = Px bottom   The final four statements actually set all the object’s padding values, like this:      164   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How To Use It Thankfully, using this plug-in is a great deal simpler than describing it. To zoom an object  either up or down all you need to do is pass the object to Zoom  , along with start and end  dimensions, like this:  Zoom myobject, 1, 1, 100, 100, 20, 20, 1000, 0, 0   This statement will zoom myobject from a width and height of 100 pixels each to just  20 each. You can also get fancy and turn a horizontal rectangle into a vertical one, like this:  Zoom myobject, 1, 1, 100, 10, 10, 100, 1000, 0, 0   This will change myobject from being 100 by 10 pixels to 10 by 100 pixels over the   course of 1000 milliseconds.  The following example displays four 86 by 86 pixel icons at a width and height of 70 by   70 pixels. You can then pass your mouse over them to zoom them up to their original size  and back down again:                   window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'      Zoom ids, 1, 1, 86,86, 70,70, 1, 1, 0      O ids, 'onmouseover', 'up'      O ids, 'onmouseout',  'down'        function up       {        Zoom this, 1, 1, 70, 70, 86, 86, 200, 1, 1      }       function down       {        Zoom this, 1, 1, 86, 86, 70, 70, 200, 1, 1      }  }     The first four lines of HTML display the icons and give them unique IDs. The     section then creates the array ids out of these IDs, which is used in the following line to  zoom down all the icons from 86 by 86 pixels to 70 by 70. It passes a value of 1 millisecond  so that the change is virtually instantaneous.  Then the O   plug-in attaches the up   and down   functions to all these icons’   onmouseover and onmouseout events en masse. In these functions, the calls to Zoom   set  the pad argument to true so that all the icons are padded as they zoom and, therefore, retain       C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    165  the same overall dimensions  so keeping the surrounding icons from moving about during  the zooms .  The interruptible argument is set to true so that each zoom can be smoothly   interrupted and reversed as you pass your mouse over and away from each icon.  If you wish to experiment, try changing the values of the pad and interruptible   arguments to false or zero and see what happens when you toggle the values of the w and  h arguments  as long as at least one remains true or 1  to change the types of zooms.  The Plug-in function Zoom id, w, h, fromw, fromh, tow, toh,     msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            Zoom id[j], w, h, fromw, fromh, tow, toh,              msecs, pad, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  typeof O id .ZO_X == UNDEF      {        O id .ZO_X = X id         O id .ZO_Y = Y id      }       if  !O id .ZO_Flag      {        O id .ZO_W     = Math.max fromw, tow         O id .ZO_H     = Math.max fromh, toh         O id .ZO_Count = 0     }     else     {        if  !O id .ZO_Int  return        else clearInterval O id .ZO_IID           O id .ZO_Count =  msecs   INTERVAL  - O id .ZO_Count     }       var maxw  = Math.max fromw, tow      var maxh  = Math.max fromh, toh      var stepw =  tow - fromw     msecs   INTERVAL      var steph =  toh - fromh     msecs   INTERVAL        S id .overflow = HID     O id .ZO_Flag  = true     O id .ZO_Int   = interruptible     O id .ZO_IID   = setInterval DoZoom, INTERVAL          166   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        function DoZoom       {        if  w  O id .ZO_W = Math.round fromw + stepw * O id .ZO_Count         if  h  O id .ZO_H = Math.round fromh + steph * O id .ZO_Count           Resize id, O id .ZO_W, O id .ZO_H           var midx = O id .ZO_X + Math.round  maxw - O id .ZO_W    2         var midy = O id .ZO_Y + Math.round  maxh - O id .ZO_H    2           if  pad > 0  ZoomPad Math.max fromw, tow ,           Math.max fromh, toh , O id .ZO_W, O id .ZO_H         else if  pad != -1  GoTo id, midx, midy           if  O id .DB_Parent            GoToEdge O id .DB_Parent, O id .DB_Where, 50           if  ++O id .ZO_Count >=  msecs   INTERVAL          {           var endx      = O id .ZO_X + Math.round  maxw - tow    2            var endy      = O id .ZO_Y + Math.round  maxh - toh    2            O id .ZO_Flag = false             Resize id, tow, toh            clearInterval O id .ZO_IID              if  pad > 0  ZoomPad fromw, fromh, tow, toh            else if  pad != -1  GoTo id, endx, endy              if  O id .DB_Parent               GoToEdge O id .DB_Parent, O id .DB_Where, 50            if  typeof CB != UNDEF  eval CB         }                function ZoomPad frw, frh, padw, padh         {           var left   = Math.max 0, frw - Math.round padw     2           var right  = left           var top    = Math.max 0, frh - Math.round padh     2           var bottom = top             if  left != Math.floor left             {              left  = Math.floor left               right = left + 1           }             if  top != Math.floor top             {              top    = Math.floor top               bottom = top + 1           }         C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    167           S id .paddingLeft   = Px left            S id .paddingRight  = Px right            S id .paddingTop    = Px top            S id .paddingBottom = Px bottom         }     }  }    50  ZoomDown   This plug-in zooms an object down over time from its current size to zero dimensions. It  does this in such a way that the object can also be zoomed back up again with the following  plug-in, ZoomRestore  . Figure 6-8 shows four icons that have had their onmouseover  events attached to this plug-in and that are in varying states of zooming after the mouse has  swept across them.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object and zooms it down until it has zero dimensions. It requires the  following arguments:  id     msecs   	 w 	 h 	  	  	    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will be zoomed down If true or 1, the object’s height will be zoomed down    The number of milliseconds the animation should take If 0, the object will be moved during resizing so as to remain centered. If greater    pad than 0, the object will be padded with CSS padding to retain its original dimensions as  it zooms down. If –1, no padding will be applied and the object will not be moved  during resizing. interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the       	  Figure 6-8  These icons are in varying states of zooming down.      168   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  ZO_Flag  ZO_Int  ZO_OldW  ZO_OldH  Zoomdown  Zoom    local variable for indexing into id if it is an array Property of id that contains true if a zoom on id is in process Property of id that contains true if a zoom is interruptible Property of id containing its previous width Property of id containing its previous height Property of id that contains true if it has been zoomed down Plug-in to zoom an object from one size to another  How It Works This plug-in starts off with the familiar code to iterate through id if it is an array and  recursively call itself with each element to process it individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         ZoomDown id[j], w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB      return  }  Next, the plug-in checks whether a zoom is already in process on id and, if so, it checks   whether that zoom is interruptible, like this:  if  O id .ZO_Flag && !O id .ZO_Int  return  If there is a zoom in action  as determined by the ZO_Flag property of id  and it cannot  be interrupted  as determined by id’s ZO_Int property  then the plug-in returns. Otherwise  the following code is executed:  else if  !O id .ZO_OldW   {     O id .ZO_OldW = W id      O id .ZO_OldH = H id      O id .ZO_X    = X id      O id .ZO_Y    = Y id   }  This checks whether the ZO_OldW property exists. If it doesn’t, id has not been zoomed   down before so its current width and height are stored in its ZO_OldW and ZO_OldH properties.  These values are obtained using the W   and H   plug-ins. Also, the coordinates of the object  are read from X id  and Y id  and stored in the ZO_X and ZO_Y properties.  The first of the final three statements sets the Zoomdown property of id to true to   indicate that the object is  or is in the process of being  zoomed down. Then the object’s  location is reset to the stored values in ZO_X and ZO_Y  to handle the case where an object  has an odd dimension length and sometimes gets disturbed by a pixel , and the Zoom         C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    169  plug-in is called, passing it the original width and height of id, the new zero width and  height values, and the value of pad and interruptible, as follows:  O id .Zoomdown = true  GoTo id, O id .ZO_X, O id .ZO_Y   Zoom id, w, h, O id .ZO_OldW, O id .ZO_OldH, 0, 0,     msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   How To Use It To use this function, you pass it an object  or array of objects  and specify the type of zoom  down you want  whether to zoom down the horizontal or vertical axis, or both , along with  the number of milliseconds it should take, whether to use padding and whether the zoom  should be interruptible, like this:  ZoomDown myobject, 1, 1, 1000, 0, 0   This zooms down myobject from whatever its current dimensions are in both the   horizontal and vertical directions, over a period of 1000 milliseconds. The final two values  specify that no padding should be used and that the zoom should not be interruptible.  Here’s an example in which four icons are displayed, which have their onmouseover   events attached to this plug-in:                   window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'      O ids, 'onmouseover', 'down'       function down       {        ZoomDown this, 1, 1, 500, 1, 1      }  }     The first section of HTML displays the images and assigns them unique IDs. The    section creates the array ids out of the ID names and then passes it to the O   plug-in, which  attaches the down   function to their onmouseover events.  The function down   simply calls ZoomDown   to zoom each icon down when the   mouse passes over it. You will notice that once an icon has been zoomed down you can still  pass the mouse over the empty space it leaves to activate another zoom. This is because the  previous width and height values of each object are stored by the ZoomDown   plug-in.      170   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Rather than allowing this messy behavior, you can attach the following plug-in,   ZoomRestore  , to the icons, so that they will zoom back up when the mouse moves away.  The Plug-in function ZoomDown id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            ZoomDown id[j], w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  O id .ZO_Flag && !O id .ZO_Int  return     else if  !O id .ZO_OldW      {        O id .ZO_OldW = W id         O id .ZO_OldH = H id         O id .ZO_X    = X id         O id .ZO_Y    = Y id      }       O id .Zoomdown = true     GoTo id, O id .ZO_X, O id .ZO_Y      Zoom id, w, h, O id .ZO_OldW, O id .ZO_OldH, 0, 0,        msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   }    51  ZoomRestore   This is the partner plug-in for ZoomDown  . With it you can restore a previously zoomed  down object over time to its original dimensions. In Figure 6-9, four icons have been  displayed with their onmouseover events attached to the ZoomDown   plug-in and their  onmouseout events attached to this plug-in.  Figure 6-9  The icons can now be zoomed down and back up with the mouse.      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    171  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object that has been zoomed down and over time zooms it back to its  original dimensions. It takes the following arguments:  id     msecs   	 w 	 h 	  	  	    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will be zoomed up If true or 1, the object’s height will be zoomed up    The number of milliseconds the animation should take   If 0, the object will be moved during resizing so as to remain centered. If greater  pad than 0, the object will be padded with CSS padding to retain its original dimensions as  it zooms down. If –1, no padding will be applied and the object will not be moved  during resizing. interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the       	  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  ZO_Flag  ZO_Int  ZO_OldW  ZO_OldH  Zoomdown  Zoom    Local variable for indexing into id if it is an array Property of id that contains true if a zoom on id is in process Property of id that contains true if a zoom is interruptible Property of id containing its previous width Property of id containing its previous height Property of id that contains true if it has been zoomed down Plug-in to zoom an object from one size to another  How It Works This plug-in begins with the familiar code to iterate through id if it is an array and recursively  call itself with each element to process it individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         ZoomRestore id[j], w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB      return  }  Next, the plug-in checks whether a zoom is already in process on id and if so it checks   whether that zoom is interruptible, like this:  if   O id .ZO_Flag && !O id .ZO_Int   !O id .Zoomdown       return  If there is a zoom in action  as determined by the ZO_Flag property of id,  and it    cannot be interrupted  as determined by id’s ZO_Int property  then the plug-in returns.       172   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Zoomdown property of id is also checked, because if it is not true then the object is not  zoomed down, so the plug-in also returns.  The final two statements set the Zoomdown property of id to false to indicate that the   object is  or is in the process of being  zoomed up, and then the Zoom   plug-in is called,  passing it the current zero width and height of id, the object’s previously saved original  width and height values in the ZO_OldW and ZO_OldH properties, and the value of pad and  interruptible, as follows:  O id .Zoomdown = false  Zoom id, w, h, 0, 0, O id .ZO_OldW, O id .ZO_OldH,     msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   How To Use It To use this function, you pass it an object  or array of objects  that has already been zoomed  down and specify the type of zoom up you want  whether to zoom the horizontal or  vertical axis, or both , along with the number of milliseconds it should take, whether to use  padding, and whether the zoom should be interruptible, like this:  ZoomRestore myobject, 1, 1, 1000, 0, 0   This restores the dimensions of myobject over a period of 1000 milliseconds from zero  width and height, back to its original values. The final two values specify that no padding  should be used, and that the zoom should not be interruptible.  The following examples extend the previous plug-in, ZoomDown  , to restore the icons   back to their original sizes when the mouse moves away from them:                   window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'      O ids, 'onmouseover', 'down'      O ids, 'onmouseout',  'up'        function down       {        ZoomDown this, 0, 1, 500, 1, 1      }       function up       {        ZoomRestore this, 0, 1, 500, 1, 1      }  }         C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    173  For this example I set the horizontal w argument of the calls to 0 so that only the height  of the objects is allowed to be resized. This has the effect of making the icons appear to spin  around their horizontal axes if you let them zoom all the way down and back up again. You  could alternatively set the vertical h argument to zero instead  but not both , and then the  icons would appear to spin around their vertical axes.  The Plug-in function ZoomRestore id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            ZoomRestore id[j], w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB         return     }       if   O id .ZO_Flag && !O id .ZO_Int   !O id .Zoomdown          return       O id .Zoomdown = false     Zoom id, w, h, 0, 0, O id .ZO_OldW, O id .ZO_OldH,        msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   }    52  ZoomToggle   The final plug-in in this chapter brings the last few zooming plug-ins together into a single  one that can zoom both down and up, in three different ways. In Figure 6-10, four icons  have been displayed, each of which is attached to this plug-in and set to zoom around its  vertical axis when the mouse passes in and out.  Figure 6-10  The ZoomToggle   plug-in being used on four different icons      174   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in toggles the zoomed down state of an object. If it is zoomed down then the  object is restored to its original dimensions; otherwise, the object is zoomed down to zero  width and height. It requires the following arguments:  id     msecs   	 w 	 h 	  	  	    An object, an object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs If true or 1, the object’s width will be zoomed If true or 1, the object’s height will be zoomed    The number of milliseconds the animation should take If 0, the object will be moved during resizing so as to remain centered. If    pad greater than 0, the object will be padded with CSS padding to retain its original  dimensions as it zooms down. If –1, no padding will be applied and the object will  not be moved during resizing. interruptible same object; otherwise, if false  or 0 , the call is uninterruptible  If true  or 1 , this plug-in can be interrupted by a new call on the       	  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  ZO_Flag  ZO_Int  Zoomdown  ZoomDown    ZoomRestore    Local variable for indexing into id if it is an array Property of id that contains true if a zoom on id is in process Property of id that contains true if a zoom is interruptible Property of id that contains true if it has been zoomed down Plug-in to zoom an object down to zero width and height Plug-in to zoom an object back to its original dimensions  How It Works This plug-in begins with the familiar code to iterate through id if it is an array and recursively  call itself with each element to process it individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         ZoomRestore id[j], w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB      return  }  Next, the ZO_Flag property of id is tested. If it is true, a zoom is currently in progress  on id so the ZO_Int property is then tested. If it is not true, the current zoom may not be  interrupted, so the plug-in returns, using the following code:  if  O id .ZO_Flag && !O id .ZO_Int  return      C h a p t e r   6 :   M o v e m e n t   a n d  an i m a t i o n    175  The final two statements check the Zoomdown property of id. If it is not true, the object   is not zoomed down so the ZoomDown   plug-in is called; otherwise, the object is zoomed  down so the ZoomRestore   plug-in is called, as follows:  if  !O id .Zoomdown  ZoomDown id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   else              ZoomRestore id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   How To Use It To use this plug-in, you don’t need to keep track of an object’s zoom down state because  you can just call it and the plug-in will decide whether an object requires zooming down or  up. All you need to do is specify whether the zoom can occur in the horizontal or vertical  direction  or both , the speed of the zoom, whether to pad the object, and if the zoom should  be interruptible, like this:  ZoomToggle myobject, 1, 0, 750, 0, 0   This statement will toggle the zoom down state of the object myobject and allows the   zoom to progress only on its width  so the object will appear to rotate about its vertical  axis . The zoom will take 750 milliseconds, will not pad myobject, and is not interruptible. The following example is similar to those in the last couple of plug-ins in that four icons   are displayed and their zoom states can be controlled by passing the mouse in and out of  them:                   window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4'      ZoomToggle Array 'i1', 'i3' , 1, 1, 1, 1, 0      O ids, 'onmouseover', 'toggle'      O ids, 'onmouseout',  'toggle'        function toggle       {        ZoomToggle this, 1, 0, 500, 1, 1      }  }     There is an extra call to ZoomToggle   just after the ids array is assigned, which   toggles the zoom down state of the first and third icons. This means that the ZoomToggle    effect can be easily seen as you pass your mouse over the icons, and some zoom into view  while others zoom down. I have chosen to allow the zoom to occur only on an object’s  width so that the icons appear to be spinning around their vertical axes.      176   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s  In Chapter 7, I’ll show how you can connect or chain a set of plug-ins together, among   other goodies, so that each one is called only when the previous one has finished. This  allows for some very creative and professional-looking animation effects and also further  extends user interaction.   NoTe  Don’t forget that while I have concentrated on images in this chapter, all the plug-ins will   work on any type of object, so you can slide, deflate, and zoom chunks of HTML or anything that  can be placed in or is a visible object.   The Plug-in function ZoomToggle id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            ZoomToggle id[j], w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB         return     }       if  O id .ZO_Flag && !O id .ZO_Int  return       if  !O id .Zoomdown  ZoomDown id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB      else              ZoomRestore id, w, h, msecs, pad, interruptible, CB   }   Chapter 7  Chaining and Interaction      178   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     In this chapter I’ll show you how you can chain together many of the plug-ins in this   book to form sequences of actions or animations. These can be animations you write to  create stunning opening effects, or they can be small chains to perform simple actions   such as moving menu elements.  Chaining is also useful for ensuring that one action will follow another. This can be very  hard to do in JavaScript because it is event driven, and therefore plug-ins called at the same  time will normally run in parallel with each other. However, by adding what is known as a  callback function at the end of many of the plug-ins, one plug-in can be set to call another  when it completes—hence the term chaining.  You’ll also learn how you can use callbacks  like a mini, two-part chain  on those   functions that support chaining.    53  Chain  , NextInChain  , and CallBack   These plug-ins are a suite of functions that enable you to line up a sequence of plug-in calls  to run in sequence, with each one calling the next when it has finished. This is a great way  to create amazing animation effects in JavaScript that you might think can only be done in  programs such as Java or Flash. Figure 7-1 shows a ball that has been set to bounce around  the screen by chaining together four calls to the Slide   plug-in.  About the Plug-ins The Chain   plug-in accepts an array of plug-in calls and then pushes them onto a stack so  that each call can be popped off one at a time and executed when the previous one finishes.  It requires the following argument:   	  calls    An array of strings containing a sequence of plug-ins to call  Table 7-1 lists the plug-ins that have the ability to call other plug-ins via a callback.  Figure 7-1  A ball is made to bounce around the screen      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    179  Chain   CallBack   ChainThis   Deflate   DeflateBetween    DeflateToggle   Fade   FadeBetween   FadeIn   FadeOut    FadeToggle   Hide   HideToggle   Pause   Reflate    Repeat   Show   Slide   SlideBetween   WaitKey    While   Zoom   ZoomDown   ZoomRestore   ZoomToggle    Table 7-1  The Plug-ins That Support the Chaining of Other Plug-ins  Table 7-2 lists the plug-ins that can be called by another plug-in via a callback. You should  not include any other plug-in calls within a chain sequence  unless you use the ChainThis    plug-in, discussed later , as they will not call up any remaining plug-ins in a chain, so a  sequence may be interrupted. However, you can always include your own plug-ins in a chain  if you place a call to NextInChain   after the final instruction has executed.  Caution  Never attempt to insert any of the Chain  , Repeat  , or While   plug-ins into a  chain or you’ll get “out of memory,” recursion, and possibly other errors. These functions can  only be used for creating chains that don’t contain calls to themselves.  The NextInChain   and CallBack   plug-ins are generally not expected to be called   directly, although you can do so using the information that follows.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions j  CHAIN_CALLS  push    pop    eval    Local variable to iterate through the calls array Global array in which chained plug-ins are stored prior to their execution. Function to push a value onto an array Function to pop a value off an array Function to evaluate a string as JavaScript code  How They Work The Chain   plug-in takes the plug-ins stored in the calls array and pushes them all onto  the global CHAIN_CALLS array. Because the last item pushed onto an array is always the   ChainThis    Deflate    FadeIn    FadeOut    Reflate    Show    DeflateBetween    FadeToggle    Slide    ZoomDown    ZoomRestore    ZoomToggle    DeflateToggle    Hide    SlideBetween    Fade    HideToggle    WaitKey    FadeBetween    Pause    Zoom    Table 7-2  The Plug-ins That Support Being Chained or Using Callbacks      180   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     first one out when using the JavaScript push   and pop   functions, they would all come  out in the reverse order if the elements were pushed onto the array in the order they were  encountered. Therefore, the calls array is traversed from end to start, pushing each  element in turn onto CHAIN_CALLS, like this:  function Chain calls   {     for  var j = calls.length ; j >= 0 ; --j         if  calls[j]            CHAIN_CALLS.push calls[j]        NextInChain    }  The first line is the one that iterates backward through the calls array. The second   checks that there is something stored in that element and, if there is, the third pushes it onto  the CHAIN_CALLS global array.  Finally, the NextInChain   plug-in  discussed next  is called to start executing the chain.  note  The push   and pop   JavaScript functions create what is known as a LIFO stack, which  stands for Last In First Out. With such a system the most recently pushed element is popped off  first, and the first element pushed onto the stack is the last one popped off it. But in the case of the  Chain   plug-in a FIFO  First In First Out  stack is required, which is achieved by pushing  the contents of the calls array onto the stack in reverse order, so that the sequence in which the  stack of calls is executed is the same as in the array originally passed to the Chain   plug-in.  The NextInChain   Plug-in The NextInChain   plug-in simply examines the global CHAIN_CALLS array and, if it has  any chained calls left to run, pops the next one off and passes it to the CallBack   plug-in  to execute it, like this:  if  CHAIN_CALLS.length      CallBack CHAIN_CALLS.pop     The CallBack   Plug-in This plug-in allows you to attach a plug-in to be called after the current one finishes  execution, like this:  var insert = expr.lastIndexOf ' '   var left   = expr.substr 0, insert   var right  = expr.substr insert   var middle = "'NextInChain  '"    if  expr.substr insert - 1, 1  != ' '      middle = ', ' + middle          eval left + middle + right       C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    181  This code works by passing the name of a plug-in to be called in the CB argument for a   function call that supports it. It does this by taking the expression passed to it and then  inserting the next call in the chain into this expression as its final argument.  To do this the string variables left, right and middle are first created, with left   containing all the expression up to the insertion point, middle a string containing a reference  to the 'NextInChain  ' plug-in, and right the remainder of the expression after the  insertion point. The reference to 'NextInChain  ' uses single quotes within double quotes  to ensure that when the string is evaluated, the single quoted string will be processed as a  string, and not the result of calling the function named in the string.  Then, if the character immediately preceding the final ‘ ’ is not a ‘ ’ this means that the   expression passed to CallBack   includes arguments, so the variable middle has a comma  and space prepended to it, to act as a variable separator. Otherwise, it keeps its assigned  value of  'NextInChain  '. Finally the three values of left, middle, and right are  concatenated and passed to the eval   function.   When a plug-in is called up this way it will notice that the CB argument is not empty  and will therefore evaluate it.  In this instance the NextInChain   plug-in will be called.  note  The reason for passing the name of a function  or an expression  in CB this way, rather than  simply having the plug-in just call NextInChain  , is to let you pass expressions of your own  to be executed as a callback. To do this you place an expression  or function call  in a string and  pass it in the CB argument to any plug-in that accepts it  listed in Table 7-1 . Your expression  will then be evaluated when the called plug-in completes.  The ChainThis   Plug-in This plug-in allows you to take a plug-in or function that is not chainable  which you can  determine by checking Table 7-2  and then use it within a chain. The code is quite simple  and looks like this:  eval expr   NextInChain    object using the following statement:  GoTo 'myobject', x   2, y + 100   For example, suppose that for one of the instructions in a chain you want to move an   You can make this call chainable by turning it into a string using the InsVars   plug-in   and ChainThis  , as follows:  string = InsVars "ChainThis 'GoTo \"myobject\", 1, 2 ' ",     x   2, y + 100   The InsVars   plug-in makes it easy to insert variables into a string by using tokens  such as 1 and 2 as place holders for them and passing the variables or expressions after  the main string.  If you then pass the string string to Chain    or Repeat   or While    as one of the   elements in a chain, the GoTo   call will be executed when its turn comes up, and the  program flow will pass onto the next item in the chain  if any .      182   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     This technique only works well with functions that work procedurally from start to end   in a single process. If you use ChainThis   on a function that does its job using events or  interrupts, you will usually get very unexpected results.  note  You may find with the InsVars   plug-in that you use up the main two levels of quotation  marks, both double and single, and need a third level of quotation. This is easily accomplished by  using the \ escape character before a quotation mark, like this: \" or this: \'. In fact, you will see  that the previous example statement uses this technique when passing the “myobject” ID to  GoTo  , because the double quote has already been used for the outside of the string and the  single quote is used for the substring being passed to CallBack  .  How To Use Them To use the Chain   plug-in, you need to create an array of plug-in calls to be chained  together, and each call must be assembled into a string before it is placed into the array. For  example, assume you wish to add the following call to a chain:  FadeOut myobject, 1000, 0   To do so, you must first convert it to a string, like this:  string1 = 'FadeOut ' + myobject + ', 1000, 0 '  Or, if you have a more complicated call, like this:  Slide 'a', width   2, height   2 - 50, width   2 -20, height   2, 500, 0   then it would need to be turned into a string, like this:  string2 = "Slide '" + a + "', " + width   2 + ", " + height   2 - 50 + ", "  + width   2 -29 + ", " + "height   2, 500, 0 "  Obviously this quickly gets very messy, so it’s almost always much easier to make use   of Plug-in 15, InsVars  , as in these two simpler versions of the preceding statements:  string1 = InsVars 'FadeOut '1', 1000, 0 ', myobject   string2 = InsVars "Slide '1', 2, 3, 4, 5, 500, 0",     ball, width   2, height   2 - 50, width   2 -20, height   2   In these two lines the argument list has simply been placed at the end of the main string,   with each value position replaced with a 1, 2, and so on, for each value to be inserted. The two strings can then be placed in a chain, and the first item in the chain started,   using the following statement:  Chain Array string1, string2    The first statement places the strings in an array which it then passes to the Chain   plug-in.    Here’s an example that uses these techniques to make a ball bounce around the browser:          window.onload = function         C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    183  {     Position 'ball', ABS      width  = GetWindowWidth       height = GetWindowHeight       r      = width  - 100     b      = height - 100     x      = width    2 - 50     y      = height   2 - 50       ch1 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", 0, y, x, 0      ch2 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", x, 0, r, y      ch3 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", r, y, x, b      ch4 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", x, b, 0, y        Chain Array ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4    }     The HTML section displays a 100 by 100 pixel image of a ball, then the first line of the    section sets the ball’s property style to ‘absolute’ so that it can be moved about. After this the width and height of the browser are calculated and stored in width and  height, then the right and bottom positions required to place the ball against these edges  are placed in r and b. These values are simply the width and height of the browser less the  ball’s width and height of 100 pixels each.  The variables x and y are also calculated to set them to coordinates that place the ball   exactly in the center of the browser  bearing in mind its width and height of 100 pixels .  Next, four Slide   plug-in calls are assembled into strings using the InsVars     plug-in. In turn, the calls slide the ball from the center left of the browser to the top middle,  then to the center right, then to the bottom middle, and finally back to the center left of the  browser.  These call strings are then placed in an array and passed to the Chain   plug-in to get   the ball rolling  so to speak .  note  Because of the way chaining has been implemented with a single global array, you can have   only one chain of plug-ins running at a time. You can sometimes carefully create a chain that  interleaves two or more separate sets of plug-ins so that a number of different animations appear  to be running concurrently. However, you will need to use trial and error to get the best results  with this technique.  Using the CallBack   Function Directly The CallBack   plug-in achieves its functionality by adding the name of a function to call  back after the current one has finished execution. You can also do this, as long as the plug-in  you call supports chaining, as detailed in Table 7-2.  For example, if you would like to have the Hide   plug-in called immediately after a   Deflate  , you can use code such as this:  Deflate myobject, 1, 1, 500, 0, 'Hide myobject '       184   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     This calls up the Deflate   plug-in, passing it myobject, with the required parameters   to deflate it over 500 milliseconds and without the possibility of the plug-in being interrupted.  However, there is a final argument, which is a call to Hide  , placed within a string so that  the string, not the result of executing the function, is passed.  You will need to tweak the syntax slightly if you are passing object IDs rather than   objects within a callback, like this:  Deflate 'myobject', 1, 1, 500, 0, "Hide 'myobject' "   This way, after the double quotes are stripped off by the eval   function that will   eventually execute this callback string, the single quotes will remain to indicate that  myobject is a string that is an object ID, and not the name of an object.  This procedure is a quick and easy way to create a two-part chain without having to   assemble a chain. Remember, however, that it works only on plug-ins that can be inserted  into a chain.  The Plug-ins function Chain calls   {     for  var j = calls.length ; j >= 0 ; --j         if  calls[j]            CHAIN_CALLS.push calls[j]        NextInChain    }    function NextInChain    {     if  CHAIN_CALLS.length         CallBack CHAIN_CALLS.pop     }    function CallBack expr   {     var insert = expr.lastIndexOf ' '      var left   = expr.substr 0, insert      var right  = expr.substr insert      var middle = "'NextInChain  '"       if  expr.substr insert - 1, 1  != ' '         middle = ', ' + middle             eval left + middle + right   }    function ChainThis expr   {     eval expr      NextInChain    }      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    185    54  Repeat   As well as chaining plug-ins together, you can make one or more plug-ins repeat a specified  number of times using the Repeat   plug-in. In a medium such as a book it’s not possible  to capture the motion in these examples, so Figure 7-2 shows the ball  slightly grayed out   as it was captured on different repetitions of an animation created using this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in allows you to repeat a chain of actions as many times as you like. It requires  the following arguments:   	  number   	  calls    The number of times the chain should be repeated   An array of strings containing a sequence of plug-ins to call  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  temp  concat    Chain    Local variable used for counting the repeats Local copy of the calls array Function to merge two or more arrays Plug-in used to chain a group of plug-ins together  How It Works This plug-in takes the calls array and duplicates it enough times so that there are number  copies of the calls, like this:  var temp = calls  for  var j = 1 ; j < number ; ++j      calls = calls.concat temp   Chain calls       Figure 7-2  You can repeat a  chain multiple  times.      186   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     First, the local array temp is assigned a copy of calls, then the concat   function   merges the contents of temp with calls, until there are number copies altogether. Finally,  the Chain   plug-in is called to start the first call running.  How To Use It Using this plug-in is the same as calling Chain   except that you also pass an additional  parameter to specify the number of times the chain should repeat.  The following example slightly modifies the one in the Chain   and NextInChain     plug-ins section to make the ball bounce around the browser 10 times:          window.onload = function    {     Position 'ball', ABS      width  = GetWindowWidth       height = GetWindowHeight       r      = width  - 100     b      = height - 100     x      = width    2 - 50     y      = height   2 - 50       ch1 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", 0, y, x, 0      ch2 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", x, 0, r, y      ch3 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", r, y, x, b      ch4 = InsVars "Slide 'ball', 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 0 ", x, b, 0, y        Repeat 10, Array ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4    }     The Plug-in function Repeat number, calls   {     var temp = calls       for  var j = 1 ; j < number ; ++j         calls = calls.concat temp        Chain calls   }    55  While   Sometimes you may find it convenient for a chain of plug-ins to keep repeating while a  certain condition is true; for example, if no key has been pressed or the mouse hasn’t been  clicked. With this plug-in you can supply a test condition along with a chain and, as long as  the condition returns true, the chain will keep repeating.      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    187  Figure 7-3 shows an animation of a sailing ship that slowly fades into view and sails   across the browser, then fades out again. Before each trip the global variable KEY_PRESS is  checked and the animation repeats until the space bar is pressed.  About the Plug-in This plug in takes an expression and an array of statements to chain if the expression  evaluates to true. It requires the following parameters:    A string containing an expression that can be evaluated to either true or    	  expr false   	  calls    An array of strings containing a sequence of plug-ins to place in a chain  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  temp  j  eval    replace    substr    push    InsVars    Chain    Local string variable used for reconstructing a string from the  array in calls Local variable for iterating through the calls array Function to evaluate a JavaScript expression Function to replace parts of a string Function to return part of a string Function to push a value onto an array Plug-in for inserting values into a string Plug-in for chaining sequences of plug-ins together  How It Works This plug-in resides within an if   statement and completes only if the string value passed  in expr evaluates to true, like this:  if  eval expr       Figure 7-3  The ship keeps on  sailing until the  space bar is  pressed.      188   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     If it does, the local string temp is created and the calls array is iterated through using   the local variable j as an index into it. This is done because the way the chain keeps  repeating is to continually pass an entire chain as a single statement of a new chain. To  understand this, consider the following pseudo code:  if expr is true then…     Add this statement to a chain     Also add this statement     And then add this statement     Now add all of the above including the if statement to the chain  What is happening here is the same as what the code in the While   plug-in does. It   first evaluates the expression and if it is true it sends all the statements it has been passed  to the Chain   plug-in. Then it also sends all of the preceding statements, so that when the  first sequence has finished executing, the if   statement and associated calls will come up  once again and will be passed once more to the While   plug-in to deal with.  The next time around, if expr evaluates to false, the While   plug-in will finish. But if   it still evaluates to true, then all the statements are again sent to Chain  , followed by all  the code required to make it start over again. And so the process continues, going round  and round until expr evaluates to false, if it ever does.  How the Additional Call to While   Is Added to a Chain In essence, what the preceding does is add a call to While   as one of the items in a chain. To  do this, each element in calls is extracted from the array and appended to the string temp.  This is because the Chain   plug-in, which will be called later, does not accept array   elements that are themselves arrays. Instead, such elements must be a string value that will  later be converted into an array by a call to eval    by the NextInChain   plug-in, which  occurs when it is the statement’s turn to be executed . The code that creates temp is as follows:  var temp = ''  for  var j = 0 ; j < calls.length ; ++j      temp += '"' + calls[j].replace  " g, '\\\"'  + '",'  Each time round the loop the value in calls[j] is extracted, the replace   function is   used to escape any double quotes, changing them from " to \". Because a double quote is  also added to the start and end of each string section  followed by a comma , any double  quotes that appear inside the strings and are not escaped will clash with the outside quotes  and create a syntax error, in the same way that the following statement would fail:  string = "She said "Hello""  The correct version of this statement with escaped double quotes is:  string = "She said \"Hello\""  The Assembled String Let’s assume that calls contains the following two strings:  FadeOut 'obj', 50, 0   FadeIn "Obj", 50, 0       C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    189  After processing through the previous code it will be turned into the following string:  "FadeOut 'obj', 50, 0 ","FadeIn \"Obj\", 50, 0 ",  Now we have a string that can be merged with another string containing the word   Array   to look like the following  once the final comma is removed :  Array "FadeOut 'obj', 50, 0 ","FadeIn \"Obj\", 50, 0 "   The eval   function can then evaluate this string back into an array. As I mentioned, the   final comma needs removing, and this is done by the following line of code, which uses the  substr   function to trim it off:  temp = temp.substr 0, temp.length -1   The new string in temp is now ready to convert into the final string to be added to the   calls array as part of the chain, which is done with the following statement:  calls.push InsVars "While '1', Array 2  ", expr, temp    This uses the InsVars   plug-in to insert the value in expr and the string just assembled   in temp into the string that is passed to the push   call.  In the case of the previous calls.push   statement, if the contents of expr is simply  the number 1  an expression that will always be true , the entire new string would look  like this:  While '1', Array "FadeOut 'obj', 50, 0 ","FadeIn \"Obj\", 50, 0 "    As you can see, this is a perfectly formatted call to the While   plug-in itself and, in   fact, it will always be identical to the call that your code made to the plug-in in the first case.  How To Use It Using this plug-in is much simpler than explaining its workings. All you have to do is make  a call to While  , passing it an expression as a string and an array of calls to be chained if  the expression evaluates to true, like this:  var c = 0  While "c++ < 3", Array "FadeIn 'obj', 50, 0 ", "FadeOut 'obj', 50, 0 "    Here the variable c is assigned the value 0, then While   is called, passing it the   expression c++ < 3. Each time the chain repeats, the value of c will be incremented until it  is 3, at which point the expression will evaluate as false, so the While   will finish. In this  instance, the object ‘obj’ will pulsate three times and then be invisible.  Here’s a much more interesting example that animates a ship sailing on the sea,   including effects such as fading in and out:                   190   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     window.onload = function    {     width  = GetWindowWidth       height = GetWindowHeight       x      = width  - 200     y      = height - 150       Locate 'sea', ABS, 0, height - 50      Resize 'sea', width, 50      S document.body .backgroundColor = 'b7d4dc'     S 'sea' .backgroundColor         = '90a5a6'     Locate 'ship', ABS, 0, y        While "KEY_PRESS != ' '",        Array            "FadeIn 'ship', 500, 0 ",           InsVars "Slide 'ship', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5000,0 ", 0, y, x, y ,           "FadeOut 'ship', 500, 0 ",           InsVars "CallBack 'GoTo \"ship\", 1, 2 ' ", 0, y                  }     The two lines of HTML set up a div to represent the sea and display an image of a   sailing ship. Next, the   section starts off by obtaining the width and height of the  browser and setting x and y to values for the sailing ship to use in a call to the Slide    plug-in.  After this, the sea is given the property style of ‘absolute’ so that it can be placed in an  exact location, and is then resized so that it takes up the bottom 50 pixels of the browser. To  represent the sky and sea colors, the document.body object has its background color  changed, while the ‘sea’ object also has its background color changed. Finally, the ship is  located at its start position of 0,y.  The final part of this example is the While   statement, which passes the following   expression:  "KEY_PRESS != ' '"  KEY_PRESS is a global variable that is automatically set to whatever the value of the last  key pressed happens to be, so this expression will return true until the space bar is pressed.  The first three statements in the chain of calls are pretty obvious; they fade the ship in,   move it across the browser, and then fade it out. However, the final call is a little more  interesting because it’s an example of using the CallBack   plug-in to turn a nonchainable  plug-in  in this case GoTo    into a chainable one, for just this single call.  It uses the InsVars   plug-in to insert the variables and values into the string   containing the GoTo   call. This string is then placed within a call to CallBack   and  becomes chainable.  Therefore, the fourth statement moves the ship back to the start position ready for its   next voyage—if the space bar still hasn’t been pressed.      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    191  note  Because the expression passed to the While   statement is tested only at the start of each   chain of calls, an entire chain will always execute before it can be stopped. If you need more  precise control than this you can always empty the global array CHAIN_CALLS  which contains  all the items in a chain . This will stop a chain after the current statement has finished and can  be done by issuing the statement CHAIN_CALLS.length = 0. If you need an even speedier  reaction to user input, a While   statement is not your best choice of plug-in, and you should  be looking at creating some event-driven code.  The Plug-in function While expr, calls   {     if  eval expr       {        var temp = ''          for  var j = 0 ; j < calls.length ; ++j            temp += '"' + calls[j].replace  " g, '\\\"'  + '",'          temp = temp.substr 0, temp.length -1         calls.push InsVars "While '1', Array 2  ", expr, temp          Chain calls      }  }    56  Pause   There are often times during an animation when you need it to stop for a while, and you  can do this with the Pause   plug-in. With it, you can specify a period of time in  milliseconds until the next plug-in in a chain is called. In Figure 7-4, the example from the  previous plug-in, While  , has a few extra commands inserted into the chain, which zoom      Figure 7-4  Inserting time  delays into chains      192   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     the ship down when it reaches the center of the browser and then pause for 1 second before  zooming it back again to resume its journey.   About the Plug-in This plug-in pauses between commands in a chain for the length of time specified. It takes  the following argument:   	  wait    Length of time to pause in milliseconds  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  setTimeout    NextInChain    Function to create a single interrupt at some point in the future Plug-in to run the next command in a chain  if there is one   How It Works This plug-in is quite straightforward. It simply makes a call to the SetTimeout   function  to make it call the NextInChain   plug-in after wait milliseconds have expired.  Because commands within a chain are linked together via the NextInChain   plug-in,   this is the only means by which the next command in a chain can be run. By setting the  timeout to occur at a future time, the chain will not continue execution until that timeout  occurs and NextInChain   is called.  Unlike the setInterval   function, setTimeout   sets up a single interrupt and then   forgets all about it once it has occurred, so there is no need to clear it.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, insert a string such as the following, which will create an event 1.5 seconds  in the future to resume execution of the chain, into an array of chain commands:  "Pause 1500 "  Here’s a fun example that illustrates the use of Pause   by zooming down the ship in   the previous plug-in, While  , when it reaches the center of the browser, then pausing for a  second before zooming it back in again, letting the ship continue on its course:              window.onload = function    {     width  = GetWindowWidth       height = GetWindowHeight       x      = width  - 200     y      = height - 150     mid				=	width	 	2	-	100         C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    193     Locate 'sea', ABS, 0, height - 50      Resize 'sea', width, 50      S document.body .backgroundColor = 'b7d4dc'     S 'sea' .backgroundColor         = '90a5a6'     Locate 'ship', ABS, 0, y        While "KEY_PRESS != \" \"",        Array            "FadeIn 'ship', 500, 0 ",  									InsVars "Slide 'ship',	0,	1,	2,	1,	2500,0 ",	y,	mid ,	 									"ZoomDown 'ship',	1,	1,	250,	0,	0 ",	 									"Pause 1000 ",	 									"ZoomRestore 'ship',	1,	1,	250,	0,	0 ",	 									InsVars "Slide 'ship',	1,	2,	3,	2,	2500,0 ",	mid,	y,	x ,	          "FadeOut 'ship', 500, 0 ",           InsVars "CallBack 'GoTo \"ship\", 0, 1 ' ", y                  }     The changes from the previous example are highlighted in bold. As you can see, the   main difference is the insertion of a call to Pause   between calls to ZoomDown   and  ZoomRestore  . The Slide   command for moving the ship has also been split into two  halves, and the variable mid is used for the midpoint of the ship’s journey.  note  Where you already know values and they do not require calculating with an expression     or taking them from a variable , there is no need to use the InsVars   plug-in to insert them   into a string because you can simply put the values in the string yourself, as I did with the  FadeIn  , ZoomDown  , Pause  , ZoomRestore  , and FadeOut   calls.  The Plug-in function Pause wait   {     setTimeout "NextInChain  ", wait   }    57  WaitKey   This plug-in is useful for inserting a pause in a chain that waits until a key is pressed. In  Figure 7-5, the chain has been paused and is using this plug-in to wait for a keypress.  About the Plug-in This plug-in halts execution of a chain until a key is pressed. It requires no arguments.      194   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 7-5  A chain waits for   a keypress  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  KEY_PRESS  INTERVAL  GetLastKey    NextInChain    DoWaitKey    SetTimeout    Global variable containing the value of the last key pressed Global variable containing the value 30 Plug-in to return the value of the last key pressed Plug-in to run the next command in a chain Subfunction to wait for a keypress before allowing a chain to  continue execution Function to create a single call to another function at a future time  How It Works This plug-in first calls the GetLastKey   function, which removes any key that has been  pressed and leaves the global variable KEY_PRESS containing the empty string. Next, the  setTimeout   function is called to create an interrupt call to the DoWaitKey   subfunction  in INTERVAL milliseconds. Here is the code for these two statements:  GetLastKey    setTimeout DoWaitKey, INTERVAL   When the DoWaitKey   subfunction is called, it checks the value of KEY_PRESS and, if   it is no longer the empty string, the NextInChain   plug-in is called to allow the next  command in a chain to run  if there is one .  Otherwise, if no key has been pressed, another call to setTimeout   is made, which  calls DoWaitKey   after another INTERVAL milliseconds to see if a key has been pressed,  using this code:  if  KEY_PRESS != ''  NextInChain    else setTimeout DoWaitKey, INTERVAL   Therefore, if there is a keypress, after calling NextInChain   the subfunction returns and  will not be called again unless a new call is made to WaitKey  , otherwise DoWaitKey   will  be repeatedly called every INTERVAL milliseconds until a key is pressed.      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    195  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you will need to insert it as a string within an array of chain commands,  as follows:  "WaitKey  "  You can then choose to ignore the key that was pressed or have a later command in the   chain use the GetLastKey   plug-in to return the key and use it.  The following example replaces the somewhat zany zooming down and back up of the   previous example in the Pause   plug-in section, with a “Press any key” message that fades  in, waits for a keypress, and then fades out again—allowing the ship to sail on its way:           Press	any	key  	      window.onload = function    {     width  = GetWindowWidth       height = GetWindowHeight       x      = width  - 200     y      = height - 150     mid    = width   2 - 100       Locate 'sea', ABS, 0, height - 50      Resize 'sea', width, 50      S document.body .backgroundColor = 'b7d4dc'     S 'sea' .backgroundColor         = '90a5a6'     Locate 'ship', ABS, 0, y      Locate 'note',	ABS,0,	y	+	115 	 			CenterX 'note' 	 			Opacity 'note',	0 	      While "KEY_PRESS != ' '",        Array            "FadeIn 'ship', 500, 0 ",           InsVars "Slide 'ship', 0, 1, 2, 1, 2500,0 ", y, mid ,        			"FadeIn 'note',	1000,	0 ",	 									"WaitKey  ",	 									"FadeOut 'note',	1000,	0 ",	          InsVars "Slide 'ship', 1, 2, 3, 2, 2500,0 ", mid, y, x ,           "FadeOut 'ship', 500, 0 ",           InsVars "CallBack 'GoTo \"ship\", 0, 1 ' ", y                  }     The differences between this and the last example are highlighted in bold. In the HTML   section, a new span has been added with the message text. In the   section, the  span is moved to the location where it will later be displayed, and its opacity is set to zero to  make it invisible.      196   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Finally, within the chain of commands the previous zoom instructions have been   replaced with calls to FadeIn  , WaitKey  , and FadeOut  .  If you press any key except the space bar when the message is displayed, the ship will  then proceed on its way and continue repeating in a loop. However, if the key you press is  the space bar, then the expression at the start of the While   command will evaluate to  true, and the chain will stop repeating.  The Plug-in function WaitKey    {     GetLastKey       setTimeout DoWaitKey, INTERVAL        function DoWaitKey       {        if  KEY_PRESS != ''  NextInChain          else setTimeout DoWaitKey, INTERVAL      }  }    58  Flip   This plug-in provides a professional flip effect that will appear to spin an object around to  reveal its reverse side. Three different spin effects are provided, making this a great way to  provide interesting visual effects and offer more information on your web pages.  In Figure 7-6, the photograph of Albert Einstein is attached to a mouse event so that   when the mouse passes over the image, it flips to reveal more information. It’s not possible to  show you the effect in the medium of a book, but think of the image as a trading or similar  type of card with a picture on the front and further information on the back. Figure 7-7  shows the “reverse” of the image as the mouse is held over it.     Figure 7-6  The image in this  web page is  reversible when  moused over.      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    197     Figure 7-7  When the mouse is  passed over the  image, it smoothly  flips over.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes two objects and then animates them so that they appear to flip over as if  they are attached back to back. It requires these arguments:    An object or object ID—it may not be an array   An object or object ID—it may not be an array If true or 1, the width will be flipped If true or 1, the height will be flipped    The number of milliseconds the flip should take If set, the objects will be padded to retain their overall dimensions during    Variables, Arrays, and Functions  Local string variable containing a command string suitable  for InsVars   to add a call to VisibilityToggle   to a  chain Local string variable containing a command string suitable for  InsVars   to add a 1 millisecond call to ZoomToggle   to  a chain Local string variable containing a command string suitable  for InsVars   to add a call of length msecs   2 to  ZoomToggle   to a chain   	  id1  id2   	 w 	   h 	    	   	  msecs    pad the flip  swap  fast  slow      198   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     ZO_Flag  CallBack    VisibilityToggle    ZoomToggle    Chain    Property of either or both id1 and id2, which is set if a  zooms already in operation on an object Plug-in to enable any command to be added to a chain Plug-in to toggle the visibility of an object Plug-in to toggle the zoom state of an object Plug-in to start a chain of calls executing  How It Works This function first checks the state of both id1 and id2’s ZO_Flag property. If either is  true, a zoom is already in operation on an object, so the function returns, like this:  if  O id1 .ZO_Flag  O id2 .ZO_Flag  return  Next, three local string variables are created as a way to keep the code tidy and stop any   lines wrapping around. They are also efficient as each string is used twice. These are the  assignments:  var swap = "ChainThis 'VisibilityToggle \"1\" ' "  var fast = "ZoomToggle '1', 2, 3,  1, 4, 0 "  var slow = "ZoomToggle '1', 2, 3, 4, 5, 0 "  The variable swap is assigned a string suitable for enabling the VisibilityToggle     plug-in to be used in a chain  by implementing it via the ChainThis   plug-in . The strings  fast and slow contain strings to place calls to the ZoomToggle   plug-in, one of them taking   1 millisecond  and therefore being virtually instantaneous  and the other taking a specified time. The 1, 2, and so on within the strings are variable or value place holders. When these   strings are passed to the InsVars   plug-in, these place holders will be replaced by the  values or variables also passed to it.  The final call in the plug-in is to the Chain   plug-in, passing it a sequence of six   commands, which are all passed through the InsVars   plug-in to combine the strings  with the variables, like this:  Chain Array         InsVars slow, id1, w, h, msecs   2, pad ,        InsVars fast, id2, w, h,            pad ,        InsVars swap, id2                       ,        InsVars slow, id2, w, h, msecs   2, pad ,        InsVars swap, id1                       ,        InsVars fast, id1, w, h,            pad       I have spaced out the code into columns so that you can more clearly see the values   being passed. The sequence of commands performs the following six steps:        1.  Zoom id1 down over half the time specified in msecs  This performs the first   half of the flip animation.  2.  Zoom id2 down over the course of 1 millisecond  This ensures that id2 is quickly   zoomed down so that can be zoomed up shortly at normal speed.      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    199              3.  Toggle id2’s visibility  from hidden to visible    After id2 has been zoomed   down, this makes it safe to make it visible ready for zooming up.  4.  Zoom id2 up over half the time specified in msecs  This performs the second   half of the flip animation.  making id1 invisible.  5.  Toggle id1’s visibility  from visible to hidden    This tidies up after the flip by   6.  Zoom id1 up over the course of 1 millisecond  Once invisible, id1 is zoomed  back up again, and the objects are then in a state where the flip can be reversed.  How To Use It To create a flip animation, you need to first have two objects of equal dimensions. They  must then be overlaid on each other with the second object’s visibility property turned off,  using code such as this:  ids = Array 'a', 'b'   Locate ids, ABS, 10, 10   VisibilityToggle 'b'   Flip 'a', 'b', 1, 0, 1000, 0   This code takes two objects that have been given the IDs of ‘a’ and ‘b’, places their   names in the array ids, and then locates them at the absolute position 10,10 with a call to  the Locate   plug-in. Object ‘b’ then has its visibility turned off by the  VisibilityToggle   plug-in. Finally, the Flip   plug-in is called with the two objects  and set to flip only the width  so that the flip will twist around the vertical axis . A time of  1000 milliseconds is specified and padding is not used.  Here’s an example that creates a mini web page on the subject of general relativity with   a photo of Albert Einstein that flips when you pass the mouse over it, revealing more  information on the reverse side:           General Relativity     General relativity is a theory of gravitation  developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of  general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which  the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational  field  for example when standing on the surface of the Earth  are  physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial  motion; an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects  move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this  being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical  mechanics.         window.onload = function    {     Hide 'c'      width  = GetWindowWidth         200   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Resize 'c', width - 220, 260      Show 'c'      ids = Array 'a', 'b'      Locate ids, ABS, width - 205, 5      Resize ids, 200, 264      VisibilityToggle 'b'      O 'a' .onmouseover = function   { Flip 'a', 'b', 1, 0, 250, 0  }     O 'b' .onmouseout  = function   { Flip 'b', 'a', 1, 0, 250, 0  }  }     The HTML section displays the two images along with a div containing the article text.   The   section then hides the text with a call to Hide   because it is going to be  resized; if it didn’t do this, the Internet Explorer browser would return the wrong browser  width in the next command as it would prepare for possibly requiring a scroll bar. After  resizing the article text, the Show   plug-in is called to display it again and, now that it has  its dimensions reduced to fit within the current window, Internet Explorer will not try to  leave a gap for a scroll bar in case it should need it.  Next, the ids array is populated with the image IDs and is passed to the Locate     plug-in to place them at the top right corner of the browser. The Resize   plug-in is also  called because, unfortunately, odd widths and heights sometimes cause a slight 1-pixel  disturbance to animations depending on the browser used  something to do with the way  they handle rounding , so ensuring that both dimensions of objects passed to Flip   are  even is the easiest way to get the best results. It also ensures that both images have the same  dimensions and will flip neatly.  Next, the second object is set to invisible before setting up the mouse events to call   Flip  . This must be done because the two images are overlaid on each other and could  have varying zIndex values, so you must ensure the correct one is at the front by making  the other one invisible.  In the final two lines, the onmouseover event of object ‘a’ is attached to a flip from   object ‘a’ to ‘b’, while the onmouseout event of object ‘b’ is attached to a flip from object ‘b’  to ‘a’.  Before any flips, object ‘a’ will be visible, so passing the mouse over it will start the flip.  After the flip has finished, object ‘b’ will be visible and the mouse will still be over it  unless  the user quickly moved it away , which is why the onmouseout even of object ‘b’ is attached:  so the animation will flip back again when the mouse moves away.  Objects as well as images Although images give the best flip results, you can pass any kind of object such as a div or  table and so on, to the Flip   plug-in. This means you could, for example, have an e-mail  button that flips over when the mouse passes over it to reveal a small form for entering  your e-mail address to subscribe to newsletters. If you do this, text and objects will flow in  and out of the object rather than rotate the way an image does, so you get a slightly  different—but still interesting—effect.  You can also use Flip   to swap sections of HTML according to the selection of radio   button or clicking of links. And don’t forget that you can flip objects horizontally and  vertically, or you can even do both at the same time to create a zoom-away-and-back-again  effect. Try changing the values in the Flip   calls of the last two lines of the example and  see what different results you get.      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    201  note  As already mentioned, when using objects that have an odd value for one or more dimensions   you may see a slight one pixel jitter occur either horizontally or vertically during a flip. This  happens because there are differences between the way different browsers round fractional  numbers and is fixed by the plug-in remembering the object’s positions before a flip and restoring  them afterwards. Even though it’s almost imperceptible, if you wish to avoid this tiny  disturbance, you should work only with dimensions that have even values. It’s quite easy to  ensure this with a call to the Resize   plug-in prior to using Flip  .  The Plug-in function Flip id1, id2, w, h, msecs, pad   {     if  O id1 .ZO_Flag  O id2 .ZO_Flag  return       var swap = "ChainThis 'VisibilityToggle \"1\" ' "     var fast = "ZoomToggle '1', 2, 3,  1, 4, 0 "     var slow = "ZoomToggle '1', 2, 3, 4, 5, 0 "       Chain Array         InsVars slow, id1, w, h, msecs   2, pad ,        InsVars fast, id2, w, h,            pad ,        InsVars swap, id2                       ,        InsVars slow, id2, w, h, msecs   2, pad ,        InsVars swap, id1                       ,        InsVars fast, id1, w, h,            pad          }     59  HoverSlide   This plug-in places an object on one of the edges of the browser with a small portion of it  revealed and the remainder hidden. When you pass your mouse over it, the object slides  out into the window to reveal itself and then slides back in again when you move the  mouse away.  Figure 7-8 shows an object that has been attached to the top of a browser, showing only   the keys of a piano. In Figure 7-9, the mouse has passed over the keyboard and slid the  object into the browser to reveal itself.  About the Plug-in This plug-in places an object across one edge of a browser boundary with most of it unseen,  outside the browser, and a small area showing that you can pass the mouse over to make  the object slide in and out. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    Either an object or an object ID—this cannot be an array of objects    The edge to which the object should be attached out of ‘top’, ‘left’, ‘right’,    	  where and ‘bottom’      202   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 7-8    An object is  attached to the  browser top  showing only its  bottom.  msecs or out     Figure 7-9  After moving the  mouse over the  object, it slides  into view.   	   	   	    The amount by which the object should be offset from the left or top of the   offset edge—if offset is a number, the amount is an exact offset in pixels, but if it is a  string prefaced with a % symbol  such as “%50” , then the object is to be placed that  percent along the edge showing    The number of pixels by which the object must poke into the browser    The number of milliseconds it should take for the object to slide either in        C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    203  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  w & h  o  t  s  u x, y  ox, oy  HS_X, HS_Y  HS_IID  INTERVAL TP, BM, LT, RT  onmouseover  onmouseout  Math.max    Math.min    setInterval    clearInterval    substr    GetWindowWidth    GetWindowHeight    W    H    GoTo    SlideIn    SlideOut    DoSlideIn    DoSlideOut    Local variables containing the furthest positions along and down an  edge that id can be placed Local variable containing the position in pixels along or down the  edge at which to display id Local variable containing the portion of the object in pixels that isn’t  displayed when id is slid out Local variable containing the number of steps in the animation  Local variable containing the coordinates of  the top left corner of  id Local variable containing the amount by which to move id for each  step when it is sliding Local variables used while updating the HS_X and HS_Y properties  of id Properties of id containing its top left coordinates Property of id used for clearing repeating interrupts set up by  setInterval   Global variable containing the value 30 Global variables standing for ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’, and ‘right’ Event attached to id when the mouse passes over it Event attached to id when the mouse passes out of it Function to return the maximum of two values Function to return the minimum of two values Function to start repeating interrupts Function to end repeating interrupts Function to return part of a string Plug-in to return the width of the browser Plug-in to return the height of the browser Plug-in to return the width of an object Plug-in to return the height of an object Plug-in to move an object to a new location Subfunction to start id sliding into the browser Subfunction to start id sliding out of the browser Sub-subfunction to perform the slide in animation Sub-subfunction to perform the slide out animation      204   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How It Works This plug-in begins by finding the farthest possible position along or down an edge that id  can be placed, by taking the browser width, subtracting the width of id from it, and placing  the result into w. The variable h is also calculated for the vertical edges, as follows:  var w = GetWindowWidth    - W id   var h = GetWindowHeight   - H id   Next, the variable o is set to zero if offset is a number or, if offset is a string   beginning with the % character, o is given the value resulting from dividing the numeric  part of the argument by 100. In the first instance, the value of zero will indicate later that an  exact offset in pixels has been passed in offset, but in the second case, a percentage  distance along the edge has been specified for where id should be located, and that value is  now in o. Here is the code that does this:  var o = offset[0] != '%' ? 0 : offset.substr 1    100  If the Left or Right Edge Has Been Chosen Next, the plug-in needs to determine which edge is going to be used, so it first tests the  value where against the global variables LT and RT  which contain the strings ‘left’ and  ‘right’ . If it is one of these, then the following code is executed:  var t = W id  - showing  var u = Math.min t, msecs   INTERVAL   var x = where == LT ? -t : w + t  var y = o ? h * o : offset  var s = t   u  This assigns the amount of id that isn’t shown by default to t, then u is assigned the   number of steps the animation requires to complete in msecs milliseconds. After this, the x  and y coordinates are determined by checking the where argument again to see if it  contains ‘left’  the value of LT . If it does, it means the left edge is being used, so x is set to  -t, which places id sufficiently off screen so that only showing pixels of the object are  visible. Otherwise, x is set to move the object off the right hand edge of the screen in a  similar fashion.  The y variable is similarly calculated, being set either to the value in offset if o is zero   in other words, an absolute offset along the edge was requested , or set to h * o because o  is a fractional value representing the percent along the edge that the object should be  located, and h is the maximum distance down the edge that the object may appear.  Finally, s, the step distance by which id should be moved for each frame of a slide, is   calculated by dividing t  the amount of id that isn’t shown by default  by u  the number of  steps required to make the animation last msecs milliseconds . These variables will all be  used during the animation stages of the plug-in.  If the Top or Bottom Edge Has Been Chosen If either the top or bottom edge has been chosen for the object’s placement, a very similar  set of calculations is made to obtain the values required for t, u, x, y, and s, as follows:      C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    205  var t = H id  - showing  var u = Math.min t, msecs   INTERVAL   var x = o ? w * o : offset  var y = where == TP ? -t : h + t  var s = t   u  Setting Up the Events The final few lines of code in the setup section move id to the location x,y; store a copy of  each in the HS_X and HS_Y properties; and set up the onmouseover and onmouseout  events to call up the SlideIn   and SlideOut   subfunctions, respectively:  GoTo id, x, y   O id .HS_X = x  O id .HS_Y = y  O id .onmouseover = SlideIn  O id .onmouseout  = SlideOut  The SlideIn   Subfunction The job of this function is to slide the object into view when the mouse passes over any part  of it. The first thing it does is cancel any previously running regular interrupts  for instance,  if the object was in the process of sliding out  with a call to clearInterval  , and then it  sets up a new regular interrupt to the DoSlideIn   sub-subfunction, like this:  if  O id .HS_IID  clearInterval O id .HS_IID   O id .HS_IID = setInterval DoSlideIn, INTERVAL   This sub-subfunction is where all the animation takes place. First, though, to make use   of smaller, more manageable variable names, ox and oy are given the values in the HS_X  and HS_Y properties of id. These are the location of the top left corner of id:  var ox = O id .HS_X  var oy = O id .HS_Y  Next, a group of if… else if… statements test for whether the edge being used is the  top, bottom, left, or right by checking the argument where against the global variables TP,  BM, LT, and RT. Then, as long as id still has further to move, the value of either ox or oy is  incremented or decremented by the step value in s. Otherwise, if there is no further  movement to make, the clearInterval   function is called to stop the repeating  interrupts, like this:  if       where == TP && oy < 0  oy = Math.min 0, oy + s   else if  where == BM && oy > h  oy = Math.max h, oy - s   else if  where == LT && ox < 0  ox = Math.min 0, ox + s   else if  where == RT && ox > w  ox = Math.max w, ox - s   else clearInterval O id .HS_IID       206   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Finally, the object is moved to the new location in ox and oy, and the HS_X and HS_Y   properties are assigned these values, as follows:  GoTo id, ox, oy   O id .HS_X = ox  O id .HS_Y = oy  The SlideOut   Subfunction The job of this function is to slide the object away again when the mouse passes out of it. The  first thing it does is cancel any previously running regular interrupts  for instance, if the  object was in the process of sliding in  with a call to clearInterval  . Then it sets up a  new regular interrupt to the DoSlideOut   sub-subfunction, like this:  if  O id .HS_IID  clearInterval O id .HS_IID   O id .HS_IID = setInterval DoSlideOut, INTERVAL   As with the similar function DoSlideIn  , copies of the properties used are first placed   into shorter variable names, like this:  var ox = O id .HS_X  var oy = O id .HS_Y  Then, if the movement hasn’t completed, the values of ox and oy are modified as   necessary depending upon which edge is being used; otherwise the repeating interrupt is  cancelled, as follows:  if       where == TP && oy > y  oy = Math.max y, oy - s   else if  where == BM && oy < y  oy = Math.min y, oy + s   else if  where == LT && ox > x  ox = Math.max x, ox - s   else if  where == RT && ox < x  ox = Math.max x, ox + s   else clearInterval O id .HS_IID   Finally, the object is moved to the new location in ox and oy, and the HS_X and HS_Y   properties are assigned these values, as follows:  GoTo id, ox, oy   O id .HS_X = ox  O id .HS_Y = oy  note  HoverSlide   is one of the more complicated plug-ins, but it does create great effects, so it’s   worth reading the preceding explanation through a few times if any parts aren’t clear at first.  How To Use It To use the HoverSlide   plug-in, you pass it an object and then tell it where the object  should be placed  out of the ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’, or ‘right’ edges , whereabouts on the edge  to place it, how much of the object to allow showing, and the speed of the sliding animation  in milliseconds, as in these two examples:  HoverSlide 'myobject', 'top', '%50', 60, 1000   HoverSlide 'myobject2', 'right', 15, 20, 1000       C h a p t e r   7 :   C h a i n i n g   a n d   I n t e r a c t i o n    207  The first statement places an object at the top edge of the browser, exactly 50 percent   along, with 60 pixels showing, and with a sliding time of 1 second. The second one does the  same for another object, but it is attached to the right edge starting 15 pixels down and has  only 20 pixels showing.  Before you call the plug-in, it’s important to give the object a style position of either   ‘absolute’ or ‘fixed’, as in these statements:  Position object, FIX   Position 'mydiv', ABS   The first of these has a fixed position  FIX  and places the object in the browser so that   even if you scroll right through the web page, the object will remain on screen exactly where  it was placed. The second has an absolute position  ABS  and places the object absolutely  within a web page so that it will start off looking exactly the same as a fixed object but will  move with the page when you scroll it.  Here’s a fun example using a fixed object to create a dynamic menu for a music store:  <table id='a' width='375' height='160'     cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' bgcolor='black'>                                                            I'll Be Bach Music Store                                                                                                   &nbsp;                                                               New! - Special Offers                    View our Guestbook                    Follow us on Twitter                    Read our Blog                                                                                                 208   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s                                      The "I'll Be Bach" Music Store                           We pride ourselves in having the widest selection of instruments of     any music store, ranging from pianos, violins, flutes, and other     classical and band instruments, to the latest electric guitars,     keyboards, synthesizers and mixing equipment.          window.onload = function    {     Position 'a', FIX      HoverSlide 'a', 'top', '%50', 60, 300   }     The vast majority of this example is plain HTML, which is intentional, because I wanted   to illustrate how easy it is to set up such a feature on your website with only a couple of  lines of JavaScript; the first one of which sets the style position of the object, and the second  displays the object with just the piano keyboard graphic image showing. By the way, the  links shown in the slide in menu are, of course, only for illustrative purposes and cannot be  clicked.   For an even more interesting effect, you could try changing the opacity of the div,    like this:  Opacity 'a', 80   Now that you have  available the full power of chaining and other interactive   techniques, in the next chapter I’ll show you some amazing menu and navigation effects  that will really help your web pages to stand out from the crowd.

Menus    and navigation are probably the areas that make the most use of JavaScript for    this purpose.  In the early days of JavaScript, the interaction was mainly limited to instant changes of  location and color as the mouse passed over a menu, but nowadays savvy web users expect  much more fluid and appealing designs with fades, transitions, and more.  The plug-ins in this chapter give you a variety of solutions that you can use as-is, or you   can build them up into more sophisticated systems. They range from sliding menus to  pop-up and down menus, folding and context menus, and even a dock bar similar to the  one used in Mac OS X.    60  HoverSlideMenu   This plug-in expands on the final one in Chapter 7, HoverSlide  , to build a complete  menu system, rather than just a single slideable menu. With it you can select a group of  objects that will be attached to one of the edges of the browser and which will slide into  view when the mouse passes over the part showing. In Figure 8-1, two almost identical sets  of objects containing links have been attached to the top and bottom of the browser.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an array of objects and then lines them all up along one of the browser edges  where they become a collection of slide in menus. The following arguments are required:   	  ids    An array of objects and or object IDs   	   	   	    The edge the objects should be attached to, either ‘top’, ‘left’, ‘right’, or     How far along the edge to locate the objects—if offset begins with a %   where ‘bottom’ offset symbol, the position will be that percent from the start, otherwise it will be offset  pixels from the start showing pass over them to cause the menu to slide in    The number of pixels to leave showing of each object so the mouse can      Figure 8-1  This plug-in creates  slide-in menus on  any edge of the  browser.      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    213   	  gap    The number of pixels to leave between each object   	  msecs    The number of milliseconds each object should take to slide in or out  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  len  total  start  jump  a  j  TP & BM  W    H    GetWindowWidth    GetWindowHeight    HoverSlide    Local variable containing the number of objects in ids Local variable containing the total width or height that all the  objects take up when brought together, including gaps Local variable containing the position along or down an edge  that the first object should be placed Local array containing the width or height of each object Local variable containing the progressive width of each object  and the gaps while positioning the objects Local variable for indexing into the a array to save the width or  height of each object Global variables containing the values ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ Plug-in to return the width of an object Plug-in to return the height of an object Plug-in to return the width of the browser Plug-in to return the height of the browser Plug-in to slide an object in and out from a browser edge  How It Works The first thing this plug-in does is assign values to some local variables, like this:  var len   = ids.length  var total = gap *  len - 1   var start =  offset[0] != '%'  ? 0 : offset.substr 1    100  var a     = []  var jump  = 0  The variable len is assigned the number of items in the ids array, and total is assigned  the width in pixels of all the gaps. Next, start is set to either 0 or the value of offset   100  if it begins with the character %. Later, if start is 0, the value in offset will be used to  align the objects in their required positions at exact positions. Otherwise, start contains   a percentage value for the start point.  After this, the array a is created to hold the widths of the objects and jump is initialized   to 0; it will store the current widths and gaps so far, as each object is given its location.  Next, there are two sections of code, the first of which is executed if either the top or   bottom of the browser is to be used for the menu:  if  where == TP  where == BM   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < len ; ++j        214   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        {        a[j]   = W ids[j]         total += a[j]     }       start = start ?  GetWindowWidth   - total  * start : offset * 1  }  The first line compares the where argument with TP and BM  global variables containing   the values ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ . If where is one of these values, the menu will be laid out  horizontally, so the for   loop places all the widths of the objects in the a array by fetching  them with the W   plug-in. The variable total is also incremented by this value so that  when the loop has finished it will contain the sum of all the object widths and all the gap  widths  the latter having been assigned earlier .  Then, if start is not zero, it contains the percentage value that was previously assigned,   so the width of the browser, as returned by GetWindowWidth   less the value in total, is  multiplied by start  which is a fractional value less than 1 , and the result is placed in  start. This value represents the percent offset from the start of the edge. However, if start  is 0, then offset contains the exact number of pixels the menus should be located from the  edge. Because this value may be a string, it is multiplied by 1 to turn it into an integer. The  result is then placed in start.  The second part of the if   statement repeats the procedure, substituting values   applicable for the left or right hand edge of the screen, like this:  else  {     for  var j = 0 ; j < len ; ++j      {        a[j]   = H ids[j]         total += a[j]     }       start = start ?  GetWindowHeight   - total  * start : offset * 1  }  Finally, another for   loop iterates through the ids array and calls the HoverSlide     plug-on for each object, placing them all in their correct positions based on the value of start,  plus that in jump. Initially, jump is zero so there is no additional offset, but as each object is  added to the menu, jump is incremented by the previous object width and the size of the gap,  so that each additional object is located at the correct distance from the previous one.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you need to create an object for each of the sliding menu parts. A div is  perfect for the job. Fill each with the images, links, and any other contents you need, and  make sure the edge of the div is a suitable tab that will make people want to pass their  mouse over it. Now all you need to do is call the plug-in, like this:  HoverSlideMenu ids1, 'top', '%50', 20, 10, 200   In this example, the objects in the array ids are passed to the plug-in, telling it to place the   menus at the browser top, 50 percent along the edge  therefore in the middle , with 20 pixels       C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    215  poking into the browser, 10 pixels space between each object, and a slide in and out time of  200 milliseconds.  Here’s an example that places such a set of menus at the top of the screen:     &nbsp;&raquo;  World News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Entertainment News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Tech News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Business News       NEWS           &nbsp;&raquo;  Hurricane News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Long Term Forecast    &nbsp;&raquo;  National Weather    &nbsp;&raquo;  Local Weather       WEATHER           &nbsp;&raquo;  Football News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Baseball News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Soccer News    &nbsp;&raquo;  Hockey News       SPORT           window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'm1', 'm2', 'm3'      Hide ids      Resize ids, 150, 100      Position ids, FIX      S ids, 'backgroundColor', 'red'      S ids, 'color', 'cyan'      Show ids      HoverSlideMenu ids, 'top', '%50', 21, 10, 200   }     This example creates three divs and places simulated links in them using   tags—in   the real world you might use   tags here. Each object is also given a unique ID.  Also the &raquo; HTML entity creates pairs of right pointing brackets.  Then, in the   section, the ids array is populated with the object names and the  Hide   plug-in makes them invisible so they will display neatly when the menus have been  created—and you shouldn’t see them jump around. It also helps to hide any content that  might make some browsers return a value that makes room for a potential horizontal scroll  bar, thus ensuring that everything centers correctly.  After resizing the objects, setting style positions, and assigning their colors, it’s then safe  to show the objects again with Show  . In fact, you must do so in order for the plug-in to be  able to look up their dimensions. Finally, the HoverSlideMenu   plug-in is called and the  menus are displayed.      216   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Note  It isn’t necessary to give all objects the same dimensions—they will still line up neatly,   spaced from each other by the value passed in the gap argument. You can also specify a value of 0  for the gap if you want all the menus to align directly next to each other. Also, don’t forget that if  you use a style position of ‘absolute’, your menus will scroll with the page, but if you use ‘fixed’  they will stay where you put them, even if the page is scrolled.  The Plug-in function HoverSlideMenu ids, where, offset, showing, gap, msecs   {     var len    = ids.length     var total  = gap *  len - 1      var start  =  offset[0] != '%'  ? 0 : offset.substr 1    100     var a      = []     var jump   = 0       if  where == TP  where == BM      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < len ; ++j         {           a[j]   = W ids[j]            total += a[j]        }             start = start ?  GetWindowWidth   - total  * start : offset * 1     }     else     {        for  var j = 0 ; j < len ; ++j         {           a[j]   = H ids[j]            total += a[j]        }             start = start ?  GetWindowHeight   - total  * start : offset * 1     }       for  var j = 0 ; j < len ; ++j      {        HoverSlide ids[j], where, start + jump, showing, msecs         jump += a[j] + gap     }  }    61  PopDown   With this function, you can remove an object from the browser using a variety of different  transitions. This plug-in is especially good for menu effects, as you’ll see in other plug-ins   in this chapter. Figure 8-2 shows four avatars from the resource website art.eonworks.com.       C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    217     Figure 8-2  Attaching four  different  PopDown   effects  to avatars  Each avatar has a different PopDown   style attached to its onmouseover event and will  disappear in different ways as you pass your mouse over them.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object and then removes it from the browser in one of a variety of  styles. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs  type    The type of pop-down—out of ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’  If true or 1, the width of the object  where applicable  will reduce If true or 1, the height of the object  where applicable  will reduce    The number of milliseconds the transition should take, except for the type    	 w 	   h 	    	   	  msecs ‘instant’, which uses no timing interruptible the same object     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  If true or 1, the plug-in can be interrupted with another call on   j  PO_IsUp  FadeOut    Deflate    ZoomDown    Hide    InsVars    Local variable for iterating though id if it is an array Property of id that is false if it is popped down, otherwise it is popped up Plug-in to fade out an object over time Plug-in to reduce an object’s dimensions over time Plug-in to zoom down an object around its center point Plug-in to hide an object so it does not appear in the browser Plug-in to insert values into a string      218   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How It Works This plug-in starts with the standard code that iterates through id if it is an array and  recursively passes each element back to itself to be dealt with individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         PopDown id[j], type, w, h, msecs, interruptible      return  }  Next, a group of four if   … else if   statements check for the different types of   pop-down requested in the argument type, like this:  if  type == 'fade'   {     FadeOut id, msecs, interruptible,        InsVars "Hide '1' ", id    }  else if   …  This first section calls the FadeOut   plug-in and passes the callback function name of   Hide  , with id as its argument, so that the object will be hidden after it has faded. The  other sections call up Deflate   and ZoomDown   in the same way and with the same  callback string, with the final section simply calling the Hide   plug-in when the type of  pop-down requested is ‘instant’.  Finally, the PO_IsUp property of id is set to false to indicate to other plug-ins that the   object is  or is on the process of being  popped down.  How To Use It Using this plug-in is as simple as passing an object  or an array of objects , along with the  pop-down type you want, out of ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’. If type is either ‘inflate’ or  ‘zoom’, you also need to specify whether the width or height  or both  dimensions should be  modified. If type is either ‘fade’ or ‘instant’, you can pass any values for these arguments, such  as 0 or null, as they will be ignored. Finally, you specify the length of time in milliseconds the  pop-down should take  if it’s not ‘instant’  and whether the plug-in can be interrupted.  Here’s an example that displays four images and attaches a different style of pop-down   to each:    Reload      &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;           window.onload = function    {     O 'a1' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a1','fade',   1,1,500,0  }       C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    219     O 'a2' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a2','inflate',1,0,500,0  }     O 'a3' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a3','zoom',   1,1,500,0  }     O 'a4' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a4','instant',1,1,500,0  }  }     The HTML section centers a group of four images and gives them unique IDs. A link is   also made to reload the page. Next, in the   section, four different calls to PopDown    are attached to the different onmouseover events of the images.  When you pass your mouse over any image it will pop down and then hide, and the   other images will all move in to take up the space it previously occupied. This is why there  is the “Reload” link above them, so that you can reload the example and watch it again. Take some time to play with each type of pop-down and note what’s different about  them. For example, the Deflate   plug-in reduces the object’s dimensions in real time,  causing the other objects to reposition as the object is deflating, whereas the ZoomDown    plug-in first zooms the object down and then collapses its width and height. You may also  wish to experiment with the w and h arguments to see how they change the type of pop- down effect.  The Plug-in function PopDown id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            PopDown id[j], type, w, h, msecs, interruptible         return     }       if  type == 'fade'      {        FadeOut id, msecs, interruptible,           InsVars "Hide '1' ", id       }     else if  type == 'inflate'      {        Deflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible,           InsVars "Hide '1' ", id       }     else if  type == 'zoom'      {        ZoomDown id, w, h, msecs, 1, interruptible,           InsVars "Hide '1' ", id       }     else if  type == 'instant'  Hide id        O id .PO_IsUp = false  }      220   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       62  PopUp   This is the partner plug-in for PopDown  . With it, you can pop an object up that has previously  been popped down. Figure 8-3 extends the one in the PopDown   plug-in by providing four  spans, which you can pass the mouse over and out of to pop an object down and back up again.   About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object and then restores its state using one of a variety of styles. It  requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs  type    The type of pop-up, out of ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’  If true or 1, the width of the object  where applicable  will expand If true or 1, the height of the object  where applicable  will expand    The number of milliseconds the transition should take, except for the type    	 w 	   h 	    	   	  msecs ‘instant’, which uses no timing interruptible the same object     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  If true or 1, the plug-in can be interrupted with another call on   j  PO_IsUp  FadeIn    Reflate    ZoomRestore    Hide    InsVars    Local variable for iterating though id if it is an array Property of id that is false if it is popped down, otherwise it is  popped up Plug-in to fade in an object over time Plug-in to expand an object’s dimensions over time Plug-in to zoom up an object around its center point Plug-in to show an object that has been hidden Plug-in to insert values into a string     Figure 8-3  With this plug-in  you can pop  objects back up  again.      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    221  How It Works This plug-in has the usual code at the start that iterates through id if it is an array and  recursively passes each element back to itself to be dealt with individually, as follows:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         PopUp id[j], type, w, h, msecs, interruptible      return  }  Next, since the object will previously have been hidden using the Hide   plug-in, it is   shown by calling Show  :  Show id   This is all that needs to be done at this point if type is ‘instant’. If it isn’t, a group of   if   … else if   statements call one of the FadeIn  , Reflate  , or ZoomRestore    plug-ins, depending on the value in type, as follows:  if  type == 'fade'      FadeIn id, msecs, interruptible   else if  type == 'inflate'      Reflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible   else if  type == 'zoom'      ZoomRestore id, w, h, msecs, 1, interruptible   Finally, the PO_IsUp property of id is set to true to indicate to other plug-ins that the   object is  or is in the process of being  popped up.  O id .PO_IsUp = true  How To Use It You use this plug-in in the same manner as PopDown   to restore an object to its original  state. Following is an example that expands on the PopDown   plug-in to make the images  pop both down and up again:      Image 1     Image 2     Image 3     Image 4                               222   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        window.onload = function    {     Position 'd', 'absolute'      CenterX 'd'        O 'l1' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a1','fade',   1,1,500,1  }     O 'l2' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a2','inflate',1,0,500,1  }     O 'l3' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a3','zoom',   1,1,500,1  }     O 'l4' .onmouseover = function   { PopDown 'a4','instant',1,1,500,1  }       O 'l1' .onmouseout  = function   { PopUp 'a1','fade',   1,1,500,1  }     O 'l2' .onmouseout  = function   { PopUp 'a2','inflate',1,0,500,1  }     O 'l3' .onmouseout  = function   { PopUp 'a3','zoom',   1,1,500,1  }     O 'l4' .onmouseout  = function   { PopUp 'a4','instant',1,1,500,1  }  }     As well as displaying the four images, the HTML section now includes four spans that  you can pass the mouse over and out of to make the associated images pop down and back  up again. The images have their alignment set to make them line up beside each other, and  they are placed in a div that is centered by a statement in the   section.  Also, in the   section, there are four more statements that attach PopUp     plug-ins to the onmouseout events of the spans.  The Plug-in function PopUp id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            PopUp id[j], type, w, h, msecs, interruptible         return     }       Show id        if  type == 'fade'         FadeIn id, msecs, interruptible      else if  type == 'inflate'         Reflate id, w, h, msecs, interruptible      else if  type == 'zoom'         ZoomRestore id, w, h, msecs, 1, interruptible        O id .PO_IsUp = true  }    63  PopToggle   With this plug-in, you can cut down on a lot of code by calling it whenever you want to  reverse the pop-down or up state of an object. Figure 8-4 shows the result of optimizing the  code from the PopUp   plug-in section to use only this plug-in.      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    223     Figure 8-4  With PopToggle    you can  substantially  optimize your code.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object and then toggles its state between popped up and down using  one of a variety of styles. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs  type    The type of pop-up or pop-down, out of ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’  If true or 1, the width of the object  where applicable  will be modified If true or 1, the height of the object  where applicable  will be modified    The number of milliseconds the transition should take, except for the type    	 w 	   h 	    	   	  msecs ‘instant’, which uses no timing interruptible the same object     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  If true or 1, the plug-in can be interrupted with another call on   j  PO_IsUp  PopDown    PopUp    Local variable for iterating though id if it is an array Property of id that is false if it is popped down, otherwise it is  popped up Plug-in to pop down an object Plug-in to pop up an object  How It Works This plug-in starts with the code used by many plug-ins to iterate through id if it is an array  and recursively pass each element back to itself to be processed individually, like this:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         PopToggle id[j], type, w, h, msecs, interruptible      return  }      224   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Next, the PO_IsUp property of id is tested to see whether it has a value. If its type is   UNDEF  or ‘undefined’  then it doesn’t, and the object has to be popped down  since it hasn’t  been popped down yet , so PO_IsUp is set to true, like this:  if  typeof O id .PO_IsUp == UNDEF      O id .PO_IsUp = true  Then a check is again made on PO_IsUp now that it must have a value of either true or  false. If it is true, the PopDown   plug-in is called; otherwise, the object is already popped  down so the PopUp   plug-in is called, as follows:  if  O id .PO_IsUp  PopDown id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   else                 PopUp id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it an object and the type of pop-up and down effect to use, out of  ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’. Then decide whether the width, height, or both  dimensions will resize  if applicable , how long the transition should take, and whether it  can be interrupted, like this:  PopToggle 'object', 'inflate', 0, 1, 500, 0   Here’s an example that rewrites the code used in the previous pop-in example to   significantly shorten it:      Image 1     Image 2     Image 3     Image 4                             window.onload = function    {     Position 'd', ABS      CenterX 'd'        O 'l1' .onmouseover = O 'l1' .onmouseout = fade     O 'l2' .onmouseover = O 'l2' .onmouseout = inflate     O 'l3' .onmouseover = O 'l3' .onmouseout = zoom     O 'l4' .onmouseover = O 'l4' .onmouseout = instant         C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    225     function fade      { PopToggle 'a1', 'fade',    1, 1, 500, 1  }     function inflate   { PopToggle 'a2', 'inflate', 1, 0, 500, 1  }     function zoom      { PopToggle 'a3', 'zoom',    1, 1, 500, 1  }     function instant   { PopToggle 'a4', 'instant', 1, 1, 500, 1  }  }      The HTML section is unchanged, but the   uses a technique I haven’t shown   you yet, which is to assign both the onmouseover and onmouseout events to the same  function, using a single statement, like this:  O 'l1' .onmouseover = O 'l1' .onmouseout = fade  This works because these events are readable as well as writable, so the onmouseout   event is first assigned to the fade   function, and the onmouseover event is then assigned  to the value in the onmouseout event.  This means only four statements are used in place of eight. Likewise, because   PopToggle   can replace both the PopDown   and PopUp   plug-ins, only four functions  are required to manage eight actions.  In fact, the functions can be attached to the events using inline, anonymous functions,   but the line lengths would become rather long and less easy to edit.  The Plug-in function PopToggle id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            PopToggle id[j], type, w, h, msecs, interruptible         return     }       if  typeof O id .PO_IsUp == UNDEF         O id .PO_IsUp = true       if  O id .PO_IsUp  PopDown id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible      else                 PopUp id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   }    64  FoldingMenu   Using the pop-up and down features of the preceding plug-ins, it’s possible to create  professional looking folding menus, which is what this plug-in offers. With it, you can  create a wide variety of different folding menus with different transition styles. For  example, Figure 8-5 shows a folding menu with four headings, each with different sets of  contents.      226   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 8-5  Creating a folding  menu side bar.  About the Plug-in The plug-in requires a pair of arrays of heading and contents objects and then displays a  folding menu based on the styles and actions you supply. It takes the following arguments:   	  headings   	  contents    An array of objects and or object IDs   An array of objects and or object IDs   	  action    The menu action type, either ‘hover’ or ‘click’   	  type  multi   	 w 	 , h     The type of transitions to use, out of ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’   If type is ‘inflate’ or ‘zoom’, these arguments specify whether the width, height,   If true or 1, more than one contents section can be open at a time  or both dimensions will be modified during transitions msecs1    The transition time in milliseconds of popping down   The transition time in milliseconds of popping up  msecs2  interruptible interrupted by another call on the same id     If true or 1, the PopUp   and PopDown   plug-in can be   Variables, Arrays, and Functions  Local variable for iterating through the headings array Property of each heading containing the object in the contents  array to which it refers Property of each object in the contents array, which is false  when an object is popped down, otherwise the object is popped  up Property of each heading’s style object used for changing the  mouse pointer when over the heading   	   	   	  j  FO_C  PO_IsUp  cursor      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    227  onmouseover  onmouseout  slice    PopUp    PopDown    PopToggle    DoFoldingMenu    Event of each heading Event of each heading Function to return a subsection of an array Plug-in to pop up an object Function to pop down an object Function to toggle the popped state of an object Subfunction to perform the transition  How It Works The first thing this plug-in does is pop down all the objects in the contents array except for  the first one, which must remain popped up—and which has its PO_IsUp property set to  true to indicate this, as follows:  PopDown contents.slice 1 , type, w, h, 1, 0   O contents[0] .PO_IsUp = true  The slice   function is used with a value of 1 to pass to PopDown   all elements from  the second element onward  because the first element of an array is 0 . The msecs argument  to PopDown   is 1 so that the transition is set to take only 1 millisecond and is, therefore,  virtually instantaneous.  Next, the headings and contents arrays are iterated though in a for   loop, using j   as an index into them, like this:  for  var j = 0 ; j < headings.length ; ++j   {     O headings[j] .FO_C   = contents[j]     S headings[j] .cursor = 'pointer'       if  action == 'hover'  O headings[j] .onmouseover = DoFoldingMenu     else                   O headings[j] .onclick     = DoFoldingMenu  }  Each heading has its FO_C property assigned the object in the associated contents array.  This will pop up and down the contents associated with a heading. Then each heading has  it cursor property set to ‘pointer’, so that the mouse pointer will change when it passes over  the heading.  After that the action argument is tested. If it is ‘hover’, the DoFoldingMenu     subfunction is attached to the current heading’s onmouseover event so that it will be called  up by passing the mouse over it.  Otherwise, the subfunction is attached to the current heading’s onclick event so that it   will only be called up when the heading is clicked.  The DoFoldingMenu Subfunction Once all the various properties and events are set up for the plug-in, the DoFoldingMenu    subfunction will be called up whenever a change to the menus is required.      228   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     When this happens, the first statement in the function checks the multi argument. If it  is true or 1, it means that more than one set of contents can be popped up at a time; in fact,  all of them can be up  or down  at the same time.  By setting the multi argument, each onmouseover or onclick event of a heading will   toggle the pop-up or pop-down state of the associated contents object with the PopToggle    plug-in, like this:  if  multi  PopToggle this.FO_C, type, w, h, msecs1, interruptible   If multi is not set, then only one contents object can be popped up at a time, so when a  new one is selected to be popped up the previously popped up one must be popped down.  This is worked out by iterating through the headings array in a for   loop, like this:  for  j = 0 ; j < headings.length ; ++j      if  O O headings[j] .FO_C .PO_IsUp && O headings[j]  != this         PopDown O headings[j] .FO_C, type, w, h, msecs1, interruptible   The variable j iterates through each element in the headings array and checks each  one’s associated contents object PO_IsUp property. If it is true or 1, the contents object is  currently popped up, so the heading object is compared with this, which refers to the  current heading that was either clicked or had the mouse passed over it. If they match, they  are one and the same and nothing happens since the currently selected contents object will  be set to a popped up state a couple of lines later in the code.  However, if the contents object that has been found to be popped up is different from   the current heading’s contents object, then it is the one that was previously popped up,  so it is popped down with a call to PopDown  . The time setting used here is from the  argument msecs1.  Finally, the currently selected contents object is set to a popped up state  if it isn’t   already popped up , like this:  if  !O this.FO_C .PO_IsUp      PopUp this.FO_C, type, w, h, msecs2, interruptible   This pop-up action is given its own time setting in msecs2 so that different folding   effects can be achieved by using differing values for msecs1 and msecs2.  How To Use It There are two main ways to use this plug-in. The first is within an accordion or folding  menu, and the other is to separate out the headings from the contents to have the control  objects in a different place from the displayed contents. The first is most suited to being  operated by mouse clicks because, as the transitions occur, new elements could pass under  the mouse cursor, and if onmouseover were used, unwanted selections could be made.  Here’s an example of an accordion-style menu driven by mouse clicks:    News      &nbsp; &raquo;  Local News    &nbsp; &raquo;  World News    &nbsp; &raquo;  Entertainment News         C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    229  &nbsp; &raquo;  Business News    &nbsp; &raquo;  Technology News         Sport      &nbsp; &raquo;  Football    &nbsp; &raquo;  Baseball    &nbsp; &raquo;  Hockey    &nbsp; &raquo;  Soccer         Weather      &nbsp; &raquo;  Movies    &nbsp; &raquo;  Music    &nbsp; &raquo;  Television         Links      &nbsp; &raquo;  Home Page    &nbsp; &raquo;  Articles    &nbsp; &raquo;  Videos    &nbsp; &raquo;  Podcasts          window.onload = function    {     headings = Array 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4'      contents = Array 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4'        FoldingMenu headings, contents, 'click', 'inflate', 0,1,1,200,300,1   }     I designed this and most other plug-ins in such a way that they do not rely on you using  CSS other than to style the menus in the way you want them. Of course, CSS can be used to  apply different styles when the mouse passes over, but the goal of this book is to enable you  to set up objects in standard HTML that you control with a small section of JavaScript.  Therefore, the HTML in this example creates four heading spans, each of which has a   span section of links underneath, although this contents could be any HTML or objects,  such as images and so on. In addition to the four headings, there are four contents sections.  I have specifically chosen spans here because browsers automatically know their   dimensions based on their contents. Divs are different in that their width is effectively  infinite  at least to the browser edge , so you cannot deflate a div’s width dimension unless  you set it, for example, using the ResizeWidth   plug-in.  The   section is very simple. Two arrays are created, one for the headings and  one for the contents. Next, the FoldingMenu   plug-in is called, with an action argument  of ‘click’, a style argument of ‘inflate’, and a multi argument of 0. The w and h arguments  are set to 0 and 1 so that only the height of an object will be adjusted during transitions.  After this, msecs1 and msecs2 are set to 200 and 300 so that popping down will take   200 milliseconds and popping up will take 300. This provides a more interesting effect than  if they are given the same values. I recommend you try altering them yourself, giving first  msecs1 the larger value and then msecs2. You’ll find you can create a wide range of  interesting effects.      230   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     You can also have a lot of fun by changing the type to another value such as ‘fade’,   ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’; you may also want to experiment with modifying the w and h arguments  to change the width and height  or both . Don’t forget that you can also change multi to true  or 1 and have a quite different type of menu, in which the headings toggle their contents  between being popped up and down.  Using the ‘hover’ Action If you plan to offer a hover effect, you’ll need to lay out your HTML slightly differently so  that when objects pop up they don’t do so under the mouse and then cause an automatic   and unwanted  mouseover event to occur—which could result in popping up the wrong  section.  Here’s one way you can modify the HTML to use the ‘hover’ action of the   FoldingMenu   plug-in:    News       Sport       Weather       Links          &nbsp; &raquo;  Local News   &nbsp;  World News   &nbsp;  Entertainment News   &nbsp;  Business News   &nbsp;  Technology News         &nbsp; &raquo;  Football   &nbsp;  Baseball   &nbsp;  Hockey   &nbsp;  Soccer         &nbsp; &raquo;  Movies   &nbsp;  Music   &nbsp;  Television         &nbsp; &raquo;  Home Page   &nbsp;  Articles   &nbsp;  Videos   &nbsp;  Podcasts         window.onload = function    {     headings = Array 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4'      contents = Array 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4'        FoldingMenu headings, contents, 'click', 'inflate', 0,1,1,200,300,1   }         C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    231  The script section is identical to the previous example; only the HTML has been changed  to place all the headings at the top, with the contents sections underneath them as shown in  Figure 8-6.  The Plug-in function FoldingMenu headings, contents, action, type, multi,     w, h, msecs1, msecs2, interruptible   {     PopDown contents.slice 1 , type, w, h, 1, 0      O contents[0] .PO_IsUp = true          for  var j = 0 ; j < headings.length ; ++j      {        O headings[j] .FO_C   = contents[j]        S headings[j] .cursor = 'pointer'          if  action == 'hover'  O headings[j] .onmouseover = DoFoldingMenu        else                   O headings[j] .onclick     = DoFoldingMenu     }       function DoFoldingMenu       {        if  multi  PopToggle this.FO_C, type, w, h, msecs1, interruptible         else        {           for  j = 0 ; j < headings.length ; ++j               if  O O headings[j] .FO_C .PO_IsUp && O headings[j]  != this                  PopDown O headings[j] .FO_C, type, w, h,                    msecs1, interruptible              if  !O this.FO_C .PO_IsUp               PopUp this.FO_C, type, w, h, msecs2, interruptible         }     }  }     Figure 8-6  The plug-in is now  used to create  ‘hover’ action  menus.      232   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       65  ContextMenu   With this plug-in, you can replace the standard mouse right-click menu with your own. Much  more than a way to block casual users from viewing the source of a page, the ContextMenu    plug-in lets you create entire sections of HTML and pop them up at the mouse cursor position  when the user clicks the right mouse button. In Figure 8-7, a simple menu for a hardware store  has been popped up with a right-click.  About the Plug-in This plug-in requires an object that, when right-clicked, should pop up a menu, which you  also pass to it. It takes the following arguments:   	   	   	    An object to which the right-click should be attached—generally, you will  id attach to the document object, but you can be more specific and attach different  context menus to different objects  arrays of objects are not supported  contents    An object containing the menu to be displayed    The type of transition effect for popping the menu up and down, out of   type ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’  w 	    If applicable and this argument is true or 1, the object’s width will be modified   h 	    If applicable and this argument is true or 1, the object’s height will be modified   during the transition  during the transition msecs   	    The number of milliseconds the pop-up transition should take  Figure 8-7    Now you can  create your own  right-click menus.

Next, it moves it off screen to a location thousands of pixels away,  removing it from the browser as quickly as possible so as not to appear within your page.  Next, contents is popped down, ready to be popped up when required, and the   oncontextmenu event of id is attached to the ContextUp   subfunction, which will pop  up contents when id is right-clicked. Here are the three lines of code that do this:  Locate contents, ABS, -10000, -10000   PopDown contents, type, 1, 1, 1, 0   O id .oncontextmenu = ContextUp      234   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The ContextUp   Subfunction The purpose of this subfunction is to react to a right-click event on id. The first thing it  does, though, is check whether it can go ahead by examining the state of flags created by the  PopUp  , PopDown  , Fade  , Deflate  , and Reflate   plug-ins, like this:  if  O contents .PO_IsUp       O contents .FA_Flag       O contents .DF_Flag  return false  If any of these flags is true, then either contents is already popped up, or one of the   transition types is already in action on contents, so the plug-in returns.  If the plug-in can proceed, it next sets the local variables x and y to the current   coordinates of the mouse cursor and then moves the popped down contents to that location  with a call to GoTo  . It calls PopUp   to pop it up, like this:  var x = MOUSE_X  var y = MOUSE_Y  GoTo contents, x, y   PopUp contents, type, w, h, msecs, 1   Next, it’s necessary to ensure that any objects that have been created or had their zIndex   property changed since the contents div was created will not appear in front of it, so the  object’s zIndex property is set to the value in ZINDEX plus 1. ZINDEX is the global variable  that tracks the highest zIndex property so far used by an object, so adding 1 to this value  ensures that contents will appear on top of every other object in the browser. Here’s the  statement that does this:  S contents .zIndex = ZINDEX + 1  The plug-in needs a way to determine whether the mouse has moved out of the area   occupied by contents, and therefore whether it needs to be popped down. You might  think that attaching to the onmouseout event of contents would do the trick but, sadly,  it won’t do so reliably and in all cases. The reason for this is if you include a form input or  other elements within contents, when the mouse passes over them the browser will  think it has passed out of being over the contents object and will prematurely trigger the  onmouseout event.  Therefore, it is necessary to track the position of the mouse and pop the object down   only if it moves out of the object’s bounds. To do this, a repeating interrupt is created to call  up the subfunction ContextDown   every INTERVAL milliseconds to see whether the  mouse is still inside the object, as follows:  O id .Context_IID = setInterval ContextDown, INTERVAL   Finally, the return statement returns a value of false to tell the browser to cancel   pulling up the standard right-click menu:  return false      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    235  The ContextDown Sub-subfunction This function monitors the position of the mouse by checking the MOUSE_X and MOUSE_Y  global variables:  if  MOUSE_X    x + W contents         MOUSE_Y    y + H contents     If the mouse pointer is not within the bounds of contents, the object is popped down   and the repeating interrupts are stopped with a call to clearInterval  , passing it the  value in the property Context_IID that was saved when setInterval   was called. Also,  the property PO_IsUp is set to false because contents has now been popped down:  PopDown contents, type, w, h, msecs, 1   clearInterval O id .Context_IID   O contents .PO_IsUp = false  If the mouse is still within the bounds of contents, the function returns to be called   again in another INTERVAL milliseconds.  Note  With a little tweaking, this plug-in could easily be adapted to create a slight buffer around  the context menu so the menu won’t disappear if the mouse goes slightly outside the boundary.   How To Use It To use this plug-in, use HTML  and CSS if you wish  to create an attractive menu  or  whatever object you want the right-click to call up , and pass it to the plug-in, along with  the object to which it should be attached, the type of pop-up transition to use, and the time  the transition should take.  Here’s an example that creates a simple menu for a hardware store:    Tom's Hardware   Right click anywhere for the main menu                &nbsp;Tom's Hardware&nbsp;     Kitchen     Bathroom     Furniture     Lighting     Flooring     Decorating     Electrical     Heating     Tools     Gardening     Offers                236   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        window.onload = function    {     S 'menu' .backgroundColor = 'abeceb'     S 'menu' .border          = 'solid 1px'     ContextMenu document, 'menu', 'fade', 0, 0, 300   }     The HTML section displays a simple heading and instructional sentence, followed by a   span with the ID ‘menu’, which contains a few links. Of course, the links go nowhere because  they only contain a  symbol, but they display as if they do.  The   section sets the background color of the menu, gives it a solid border,   and then calls up ContextMenu   to prepare the browser for handling right-clicks.  You might want to play with this example by trying different style arguments such as  ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, and ‘instant’. You can also play with the w and h arguments, as well as the  timing in msecs.  Something else you can try is to create an object and attach the menu to that rather than  the entire document. Or, try making a couple of different menus for different objects—once  you have this plug-in in your web toolkit, you are on your way to creating some highly  dynamic and interactive websites.  The Plug-in function ContextMenu id, contents, type, w, h, msecs   {     Locate contents, ABS, -10000, -10000      PopDown contents, type, 1, 1, 1, 0      O id .oncontextmenu = ContextUp       function ContextUp       {        if  O contents .PO_IsUp             O contents .FA_Flag             O contents .DF_Flag  return false          var x = MOUSE_X        var y = MOUSE_Y        GoTo contents, x, y         PopUp contents, type, w, h, msecs, 1         S contents .zIndex = ZINDEX + 1        O id .Context_IID  = setInterval ContextDown, INTERVAL         return false          function ContextDown          {           if  MOUSE_X    x + W contents                  MOUSE_Y    y + H contents              {              PopDown contents, type, w, h, msecs, 1               clearInterval O id .Context_IID        C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    237              O contents .PO_IsUp = false           }        }     }  }    66  DockBar   This plug-in adds a dock bar to the browser similar to the one used by Mac OS X. It’s easily  configurable and can be attached to any of the browser’s four edges. Figure 8-8 shows six  dock bar icons attached to the bottom edge of a browser using this plug-in, with one in the  process of zooming up.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a containing object and list of elements within the object and turns them  into a dock bar that you can affix to any edge of the browser. It requires the following  arguments:   	    A containing object such as a div or span that holds the individual dock bar   id elements—this cannot be an array items    An array of objects located within id, usually comprising images   The edge to which the bar should be attached, out of ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘left’,     The percentage by which an item should enlarge when the mouse     The number of milliseconds the transition should take   	   	   	   	  where or ‘right’ increase passes over it msecs  Figure 8-8  Use this plug-in to create impressive dock bars.      238   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  verticalAlign  j oldw, oldh TP, BM  align  cursor  DB_Parent  DB_Where  DB_Name  DB_OldW, DB_OldH  DB_NewW, DB_NewH  onmouseover  onmouseout  Math.round    Position    GoToEdge    Zoom    DockUp    DockDown    Local variable used for iterating through the items array Local variables containing the original width and height of an item Global variables containing the strings ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ Style property of the elements of the items array Property of the elements of the items array Style property of the elements of the items array to set the mouse  cursor icon Property of each element of the items array containing a copy of id Property of each element of the items array containing a copy of  where Property of each element of the items array containing a copy of the  element Properties of each element of the items array containing the original  width and height of the element Properties of each element of the items array containing the  enlarged width and height of the element Event of each element of the items array used for attaching to  DockUp   Event of each element of the items array used for attaching to  DockDown   Function to turn a floating point number into an integer Plug-in to change the style position of an object Plug-in to move an object to a browser edge Plug-in to zoom an object down or up Subfunction to zoom up an object Subfunction to zoom down an object  How It Works This plug-in starts by releasing the containing object in id from the browser and giving it   a style position of ‘fixed’ to ensure that the dock bar will stay in place even if the browser is  scrolled, as follows  FIX being a global variable with the value ‘fixed’ :  Position id, FIX   Then all the elements in the items array are iterated through in a for   loop with the   local variable j as the index pointer, and the first statements within the loop set the  alignment of each element, like this:  for  var j = 0 ; j < items.length ; ++j   {       C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    239     if  where[1] == TP  where == BM         S items[j] .verticalAlign = where     else       O items[j] .align = where  If the argument where has either of the values ‘top’ or ‘bottom’  tested by the global  variables TP and BM , then the verticalAlign style property of the element is set to the  value in where. Otherwise, where must have a value of either ‘left’ or ‘right’ so the align  property of the element is given that value.  Next, each element’s original width and height is extracted from the W   and H   plug-ins   and placed in the local variables oldw and oldh, like this:  var oldw = W items[j]   var oldh = H items[j]   After that, the cursor to display whenever the mouse is over an element is set to ‘pointer’   and several properties are created, as follows:  S items[j] .cursor    = 'pointer'  O items[j] .DB_Parent = id  O items[j] .DB_Where  = where  O items[j] .DB_OldW   = oldw  O items[j] .DB_OldH   = oldh  O items[j] .DB_NewW   = Math.round oldw + oldw * increase   100   O items[j] .DB_NewH   = Math.round oldh + oldh * increase   100   This causes information about the element and the containing object it is located within   to be stored as new properties of the elements. These properties can then be referenced by  the following DockUp   and DockDown   subfunctions and also be referenced from within  the Zoom   plug-in which this one relies on.  First, the id object is copied to the DB_Parent property. Next, the value in where is   copied so that Zoom   will know where to place the element as it zooms it, and oldw and  oldh are added as properties to tell Zoom   where to zoom up from. The width and height  that an element should be zoomed up to are also calculated by increasing the original width  and height by the percentage value in increase and placed in the DB_NewW and DB_NewH  properties.  The final two statements in this loop attach the DockUp   and DockDown   subfunctions   to the element’s onmouseover and onmouseout events, respectively, as follows:  O items[j] .onmouseover = DockUp  O items[j] .onmouseout  = DockDown  Finally, in the setup section of code, the containing object id is moved to the edge   indicated by the value in where, like this:  GoToEdge id, where, 50   The DockUp   and DockDown   Subfunctions These two functions trigger either the popping up or the popping down of an element by  passing the various properties of the pseudo object this to the Zoom   plug-in; this being  a keyword that represents the object that triggered the event that called the function.      240   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The two functions are very similar and simply swap the positions of the original and   larger dimensions of the element. Here’s the statement that zooms an object up:  Zoom this, 1, 1, O this .DB_OldW, O this .DB_OldH,     O this .DB_NewW, O this .DB_NewH, msecs, 0, 1   And this one zooms it back down again:  Zoom this, 1, 1, O this .DB_NewW, O this .DB_NewH,     O this .DB_OldW, O this .DB_OldH, msecs, 0, 1   How To Use It To use this plug-in to create a dock bar, you first need to create an HTML object to contain  the various elements. Usually a simple span or div is all you need. Next, place the elements  that comprise the dock bar in that container. Generally, you will want to use images, but  you can use other objects if you wish.  Here’s an example that creates a six-icon dock bar:                               window.onload = function    {     Position 'dock', FIX      ids = Array 'i1', 'i2', 'i3', 'i4', 'i5', 'i6'      DockBar 'dock', ids, 'bottom', 32, 256   }     As you can see, it’s all very simple and easy to assemble. I placed only the images in the  span, but you will probably want to enclose each image within an   …   pair  of tags to give them a click action.  In this instance, I placed the dock bar at the bottom, but a quick change to the where   argument from ‘bottom’ to ‘top’ will move it to the top of the browser.  If you wish to place a dock bar on the left or right edge of the browser, you’ll need to   slightly alter the HTML, like this:                          C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    241            Notice that all I added are some   statements to ensure that the   elements line up one below the other. Now you can change the where argument in the    section to either ‘left’ or ‘right’ to attach the dock bar to the left or right edge.  tip  You can apply a background or gradient to the enclosing span to provide a greater effect.  The Plug-in function DockBar id, items, where, increase, msecs   {     Position id, FIX        for  var j = 0 ; j < items.length ; ++j      {        if  where == TP  where == BM            S items[j] .verticalAlign = where        else       O items[j] .align = where          var oldw = W items[j]         var oldh = H items[j]           S items[j] .cursor    = 'pointer'        O items[j] .DB_Parent = id        O items[j] .DB_Where  = where        O items[j] .DB_OldW   = oldw        O items[j] .DB_OldH   = oldh        O items[j] .DB_NewW   = Math.round oldw + oldw * increase   100         O items[j] .DB_NewH   = Math.round oldh + oldh * increase   100           O items[j] .onmouseover = DockUp        O items[j] .onmouseout  = DockDown     }       GoToEdge id, where, 50           function DockUp       {        Zoom this, 1, 1, O this .DB_OldW, O this .DB_OldH,           O this .DB_NewW, O this .DB_NewH, msecs, 0, 1      }       function DockDown       {        Zoom this, 1, 1, O this .DB_NewW, O this .DB_NewH,           O this .DB_OldW, O this .DB_OldH, msecs, 0, 1      }  }      242   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       67  RollOver   You’ve almost certainly seen and used rollover images that change as the mouse passes over  them, but what about making rollover objects do the same? That’s what this plug-in does.  With it, rollovers can contain HTML, images, and anything else you like, making it much  more powerful than simple image rollovers.  Figure 8-9 shows an advertisement from a classified ads site. When you mouse over the ad, it rolls over to show the new details in Figure 8-10.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes two objects that can be images, divs, or spans containing HTML and or  images. It creates a rollover so that the second object is displayed when the mouse passes  across the first. It requires the following arguments:   	   	    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs—if it is an array,   ro1 then ro2 must also be an array with the same number of elements ro2 only be an array if ro1 is an array    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs—this should   Variables, Arrays, and Functions  a w, h x, y  iid  MOUSE_X, MOUSE_Y  Hide    HideToggle    Locate    onmouseover  DoRoll    RollCheck    Local array containing the objects in ro1 and ro2 Local variable containing the width and height of the objects Local variable containing the top left corner coordinates of the objects Local variable containing the result of calling setInterval   used  later for calling clearInterval   Global variables containing the current horizontal and vertical  positions of the mouse pointer Plug-in to hide an object Plug-in to toggle the hidden shown state of an object Plug-in to move an object to another location and assign it a style  position property such as ‘relative’ or ‘absolute’, and so on Event of ro1 that calls up the DoRoll   subfunction Subfunction to perform a rollover from ro1 to ro2 and then set up a  repeating interrupt to the RollCheck   sub-subfunction to see if the  mouse has moved away yet Sub-subfunction that returns every INTERVAL milliseconds when it is  called unless the mouse has moved away from ro2, in which case the  objects are rolled back again  How It Works This plug-in supports arrays as well as single objects and is almost unique among all the  plug-ins in that, if the first argument is an array, then the second one must also be an array.       C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    243     Figure 8-9  A rollover has been  attached to this  “for sale”  classified ad.  Usually, if the first argument is an array the second argument, a single object, is assigned to  all elements of the array, but this plug-in requires either two single objects or two arrays.  In the former case, the first object is rolled over with the second. In the latter case, each   element of the first array will roll over with each matching element in the second array.  The first few lines of code facilitate recursively passing on the elements of both arrays as   individual items back to the same function to be processed as individual items  there is no  error checking, so make sure you pass two matching arrays or two objects :  if  ro1 instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         RollOver ro1[j], ro2[j]      return  }  Next, the local array a is assigned elements ro1 and ro2 to make them easier for later   functions to access them. Then the width and height and horizontal and vertical locations of  the objects are saved in the local variables w, h, x, and y, like this:  var a = Array ro1, ro2   var w = W ro1  + 1  var h = H ro1  + 1  var x = X ro1   var y = Y ro1      Figure 8-10  When the mouse  passes over, the  second object is  displayed.      244   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The width and height each have a pixel added to resolve issues in some browsers where  there might otherwise be an anomaly at the edge boundary, which could cause the rollover  to cycle rapidly.  The final three lines of the main setup section hide ro2 so that only ro1 is visible, then   both ro1 and ro2 are located relative to their enclosing object at an offset of 0,0, so that they  are on top of each other. Finally, an onmouseover event attaches the DoRoll   subfunction  to the onmouseover event of ro1, as follows:  Hide ro2   Locate a, REL, 0, 0   O ro1 .onmouseover = DoRoll  The DoRoll   Subfunction This function swaps the two objects’ visibility properties so that ro2 becomes visible and  ro1 becomes hidden. Then it sets up a repeating interrupt to call the RollCheck     sub-subfunction every INTERVAL milliseconds, like this:  HideToggle a   var iid = setInterval RollCheck, INTERVAL   The local variable iid is give the value returned by setInterval  , which will later be   used by clearInterval   to cancel the repeating interrupts.  The RollCheck   Sub-subfunction This function simply checks whether the mouse has moved out of the space occupied by the  objects. If it has, it swaps the two objects back so that ro1 is visible and ro2 is again hidden.  Then it cancels the repeating interrupts with a call to clearInterval  , like this:  if  MOUSE_X   x + w       MOUSE_Y   y + h   {     HideToggle a      clearInterval iid   }  Why Not Use onmouseout Instead of RollCheck  ? Much as I would like to use onmouseout instead of RollCheck  , it’s not possible to do so  on an object that contains many different items because passing the mouse cursor between  these items will often trigger an unwanted onmouseout event. Therefore the simplest, and  also a 100 percent reliable solution, is to check whether the mouse has moved out of the area  and then call the code that you would otherwise have attached to an onmouseout event.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you need to prepare two objects that have the same width and height.  You can then pass them as arguments. Or, if you prefer, you can create several sets of  matching pairs to use as rollovers and pass two arrays to the plug-in. This saves repeated  calls to the plug-in if you have many sets to create.      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    245  Here’s an example that uses two single objects to create a rollover effect for a classified ad:        For sale: 600 room, 300 year old central London house, located  close to all the amenities, right in the heart of Westminster city.           829,818 sq ft: Historical setting, famous residents, exquisitely  decorated throughout. Phone 555 1234 for more details.        window.onload = function    {     rolls = Array 'r1', 'r2'      S rolls, 'border', 'solid 1px'      Resize rolls, 320, 100      S 'p1' .paddingRight = Px 10      S 'p2' .paddingLeft  = Px 10      RollOver 'r1', 'r2'   }     The HTML section creates two divs and places some text and an image in each. Then the     section creates the array rolls, which adds a border to each object and resizes  them both to 320 by 100 pixels.  A couple of calls to the S   plug-in sets up some padding around the images so that the   text doesn’t align right up against them, and then the RollOver   plug-in is called to  combine the two objects into a single rollover.  The Plug-in function RollOver ro1, ro2   {     if  ro1 instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            RollOver ro1[j], ro2[j]         return     }       var a = Array ro1, ro2      var w = W ro1  + 1     var h = H ro1  + 1     var x = X ro1      var y = Y ro1           Hide ro2      Locate a, REL, 0, 0      O ro1 .onmouseover = DoRoll          function DoRoll       {       246   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s           HideToggle a         var iid = setInterval RollCheck, INTERVAL                 function RollCheck          {           if  MOUSE_X   x + w                MOUSE_Y   y + h            {              HideToggle a               clearInterval iid            }        }     }  }    68  Breadcrumbs   This plug-in provides an automatic trail of “breadcrumbs” leading from a website’s home  page to the current page. With it, users can backtrack to any location between the current  page and the home page with a single click. Figure 8-11 shows the plug-in being used on   a page in a local file system on a Windows PC.  About the Plug-in This plug-in returns the HTML to create a breadcrumb trail from the current web page back  to the home page. It requires the following argument:   	  spacer    A string of characters to place between each breadcrumb  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  parts  crumbs  title  url  display  j  push    InsVars    Local array containing the URL of the current page split into parts Local array that builds the breadcrumbs Local variable containing the title of the current web page, if any Local variable containing the URL of the website Local variable containing the main HTML to return to Local variable for iterating through different arrays Function to push a value onto an array Plug-in to insert values into a string  How It Works This plug-in fetches the path to the current page from self.location.href and splits it at  the ? character  if there is one  to extract the main URL from any query string. Then the half  before the ? is split again at every   character, with the result being placed in the array parts.  After that, the crumbs array is created, which will be built up to contain the path. It is   assigned an initial value of parts[0]  which will be http: or ftp: and so on , followed by  the string ‘  ’, like this:      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    247  Figure 8-11    Breadcrumbs  provide a quick  and easy website  navigation aid.  var parts  = self.location.href.split '?' [0].split ' '   var crumbs = Array parts[0] + '  '   Next a for   loop iterates through all but the first two elements of the parts array to   reassemble the URL into the crumbs array using the push   function, as follows:  for  var j = 2 ; j < parts.length ; ++j   {     if  parts[j] == ''  crumbs[0] += ' '     else crumbs.push parts[j]   }  The next three lines of code extract the title of the page  if any , the main URL of the   website, and the first breadcrumb, named ‘Home’, like this:  var title   = document.title ? document.title : parts[j - 1]  var url     = crumbs[0] + crumbs[1]  var display = InsVars " Home ", url   The InsVars   plug-in inserts the value in url into the string display, replacing the   1. If no title is found, the filename of the current page is used instead. Then, if no argument  was supplied for the spacer to place between each breadcrumb, spacer is given the default  value of a single space:  if  typeof spacer == UNDEF  gap = ' '  After this, another for   loop extracts each element from the crumbs array and   attaches it  prefaced with a   character  to the display string with suitable HTML anchor  tags, like this:  for  j = 2 ; j < crumbs.length - 1 ; ++j   {     url     += ' ' + crumbs[j]     display += spacer + InsVars " 2 ", url, crumbs[j]   }  Finally, the contents of display is returned, prepended to another spacer string,   followed by the page title:  return display + spacer + title      248   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it a string to use as a spacer between the breadcrumbs, and the  breadcrumb string will be returned. Here’s a simple example to do just that:           window.onload = function    {     O 'bc' .innerHTML = Breadcrumbs " &raquo; "   }     The HTML section creates a div in which the result will be placed, while the     section makes a single call and places the result into the innerHTML property of the div.  Because simple, plain HTML is returned, you can use CSS to style the returned string to  make it fit with your web page design.  The Plug-in function Breadcrumbs spacer   {     var parts  = self.location.href.split '?' [0].split ' '      var crumbs = Array parts[0] + '  '        for  var j = 2 ; j < parts.length ; ++j      {        if  parts[j] == ''  crumbs[0] += ' '        else crumbs.push parts[j]      }       var title   = document.title ? document.title : parts[j - 1]     var url     = crumbs[0] + crumbs[1]     var display = InsVars " Home ", url         if  typeof spacer == UNDEF  gap = ' '        for  j = 2 ; j < crumbs.length - 1 ; ++j      {        url     += ' ' + crumbs[j]        display += spacer + InsVars " 2 ", url, crumbs[j]      }       return display + spacer + title  }    69  BrowserWindow   Didn’t you just hate pop-ups before browsers came with blockers? In my view, there is  nothing wrong with the concept of pop-ups, it’s just that it was too easy for websites to  inundate you with them, and once everyone started using them it turned into a nightmare.      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    249  However, when I set up an Internet radio station in the 1990s, I used pop-ups to good  effect by implementing them as an audio player console so that people could listen to the  radio while they continued to surf in the main browser window. Perhaps partly due to the  novelty, most of the website’s visitors kept these pop-ups open for long periods as they  listened to our shows.  Even though they have a bad name nowadays, pop-ups do have plenty of sensible uses,   such as providing alerts and instant message notifications, for example. This plug-in provides  a versatile in-browser pop-up that’s more user friendly than opening a new browser window  pop-up—which will generally only get blocked anyway. It also gives the user full control, as it  can be moved around the browser window and is easily dismissible.  With this plug-in, you can ask a user for their login details, display private messages   from another user in a forum, provide a selection of options, and so on. Or, as in Figure 8-12,  you can pop up a window to provide further details when a user clicks a link. The great  thing about it is that the user has full control. They can keep the widow raised and move it  around to reveal any content it was covering, or they can simply close it.  About the Plug-in This plug-in creates an in-browser pop-up window that can be moved about by the user  and also popped back down again. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID identifying the main container—this may not be an array   	  headerid    An object or object ID identifying the draggable header   An object or object ID identifying the close button  closeid   	 x 	  & y  The top left coordinates of the pop-up  Figure 8-12    Creating an in- browser pop-up  window      250   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        If true, the pop-up is forced to stay within the browser window,    	   	  bounds otherwise it may be moved off the edges type ‘fade’, ‘inflate’, ‘zoom’, or ‘instant’    The type of transition to use when popping the pop-up up or down, either   w 	  & h   If type is either ‘inflate’ or ‘zoom’, w and h specify which dimension s  will     The number of milliseconds a pop-up or pop-down should take  unless   be modified, otherwise these values will be ignored msecs type is ‘instant’    interruptible its pop-up transition   	   	  If true, the pop-up can be interrupted by a pop-down call during   Variables, Arrays, and Functions  browserw,  browserh borderw, borderh  popupw, popuph xoffset, yoffset  x, y  r, b  cursor  onclick  onmousedown MOUSE_X, MOUSE_Y  MOUSE_DOWN  MOUSE_IN  SCROLL_X,  SCROLL_Y  setInterval    clearInterval    Math.max    Math.min    PreventAction    Local variables containing the width and height of the browser  Local variables containing the total widths of the left and right and top  and bottom borders of the pop-up Local variables containing the width and height of the pop-up Local variables of the BWMove   subfunction containing the differences  between the pop-up location and the current mouse positions Local variables of the DoBWMove   sub-subfunction containing the  differences between the current and saved mouse positions Local variables of the DoBWMove   sub-subfunction containing the  right and bottom maximum allowable coordinates for the pop-up if  bounds is true Style property of closeid set to ‘pointer’ when the mouse passes  over it Event of id attached to the BWToFront   subfunction and event of  closeid attached to the BWCloseWindow   subfunction Event of headerid attached to the BWMove   subfunction Global variables containing the coordinates of the mouse cursor Global variable set to true when the mouse button is down Global variable set to true when the mouse cursor is within the  bounds of the browser Global variables containing the number of pixels the document has  been scrolled in the horizontal and vertical directions Function to start repeated interrupts Function to stop repeated interrupts Function to return the maximum of two values Function to return the minimum of two values Plug-in to stop an event from occurring      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    251  GoTo    PopUp    PopDown    BWToFront    BWCloseWindow    BWMove    DoBWMove    Plug-in to move an object to a new location Plug-in to pop up a previously popped down object Plug-in to pop down and object Subfunction to bring a pop-up window to the front Subfunction to close a pop-up window Subfunction to prepare to move a pop-up when it is dragged Sub-subfunction to move a pop-up when it is dragged  How It Works The first thing this plug-in does is move the pop-up to its correct location and initiate the  pop-up process, like this:  GoTo id, x, y   PopUp id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   Next, some local variables are assigned values to keep track of the browser’s dimensions,   the borders  if any  of the pop-up, and its width and height, as follows:  var browserw = GetWindowWidth    var browserh = GetWindowHeight    var borderw  = NoPx S id .borderLeftWidth  +                 NoPx S id .borderRightWidth   var borderh  = NoPx S id .borderTopWidth   +                 NoPx S id .borderBottomWidth   var popupw   = W id   var popuph   = H id   The mouse cursor is then set to become a pointer when it passes over the closeid   object, which is used as the close button. After that, the BWToFront   subfunction is  assigned to the onclick event of the pop-up so that whenever you click anywhere on the  pop-up, if it is partially obscured by another, it is brought to the front.  In addition, the closeid object is assigned to the BWCloseWindow   subfunction so   that clicking the close button will pop the window down, and the BWMove   subfunction is  attached to the headerid object so that you can click and drag the header to move the  pop-up about, like this:  S closeid .cursor       = 'pointer'  O id .onclick           = BWToFront  O closeid .onclick      = BWCloseWindow  O headerid .onmousedown = BWMove  The last couple of lines in the main setup section of code use the PreventAction    plug-in to disable the ‘select’ event on the headerid and closeid objects. If this is not  done, dragging the pop-up quickly may highlight parts of the header text because the  pop-up will drag behind the pointer. This unsightly behavior is prevented like this:  PreventAction headerid, 'select', true   PreventAction closeid,  'select', true       252   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The BWToFront   and BWCloseWindow   Subfunctions The BWToFront   function simply changes the style zIndex property of the pop-up so that  it is brought to the front, like this:  S id .zIndex = ++ZINDEX  Every time an in-browser window such as id is clicked, this function is called, moving   it to the front, and updating the value in ZINDEX.  The BWCloseWindow   function pops the pop-up down, like this:  PopDown id, type, w, h, msecs, interruptible   The BWMove Subfunction The job of this function is to prepare the pop-up for being dragged around. First, the pop-up  is brought to the front with a call to BWToFront   and the mouse cursor is changed to the  operating system’s icon for moving a window, like this:  BWToFront    S headerid .cursor = 'move'  Next, it makes copies of the current difference between the top left corner of the pop-up   and the current mouse position, placing them in xoffset and yoffset, and setInterval    is called to create repeating interrupts to the DoBWMove   sub-subfunction every 10 milliseconds  to allow the object to be dragged about, as follows:  var xoffset = MOUSE_X - X id   var yoffset = MOUSE_Y - Y id   var iid    = setInterval DoBWMove, 10   The DoBWMove   Sub-subfunction This is the function that actually moves the pop-up about. It starts by giving the local  variables x and y the difference between the current mouse location and the location that  was stored in xoffset and yoffset when BWMove   was initially called, like this:  var x = MOUSE_X - xoffset  var y = MOUSE_Y - yoffset  Then the bounds argument is tested. If it is true or 1, then the pop-up must stay within   the main browser window, and the farthest horizontal and vertical locations the pop-up  may go to are placed in the local variables r and b  for right and bottom . These values are  then used to calculate the new values of x and y, using the Math.min   and Math.max    functions to ensure the pop-up stays in bounds, like this:  var r = browserw - popupw - borderw + SCROLL_X  var b = browserh - popuph - borderh + SCROLL_Y  x     = Math.max 0, Math.min x, r    y     = Math.max 0, Math.min y, b    Next, the current mouse position is tested to see whether it is outside the bounds of the  browser window or if the mouse button is no longer down. In any of these cases, dragging       C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    253  of the pop-up must be terminated so the clearInterval   function is called to stop the  repeating interrupts and the mouse cursor icon for the headerid object is restored to the  default, like this:  if  MOUSE_X    browserw + SCROLL_X        MOUSE_Y    browserh + SCROLL_Y        !MOUSE_DOWN  !MOUSE_IN   {     clearInterval iid      S headerid .cursor = 'default'  }  Finally, whether or not the interrupts have been stopped, a call is made to GoTo   to   update the location of the pop-up, like this:  GoTo id, x, y   If the interrupts have not been turned off, DoBWMove   will be called again in another   10 milliseconds, and so on, until dragging the object has stopped.  The use of SCROLL_X and SCROLL_Y means that, as long as they have the style position  property of ‘absolute’, these windows can be made to pop up anywhere within a document,  not just within the viewable area.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you must first create an object that will be the main container for the  plug-in. This can be a div, a span, or even a table. Then you need to place a couple of  different elements within this container, namely a header which will drag the pop-up about  and a close button for dismissing the pop-up. Once this is done, you can place anything else  you want in your pop-up and it will be ready to be called up.  Following is an example that uses a table to create the various elements. Many people   will say this is not the correct use for tables and that I should use CSS. However, my aim in  this example is to avoid styling as much as possible and provide the bare bones to keep it  easy to follow. A simple table is easy to understand and uses less code than CSS styling  would take:    Click me to raise the window                                   In Browser Window                                 X                                                               254   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s                 JavaScript is the free language built into all modern               browsers and is the power behind dynamic HTML and the Ajax              used for Web 2.0 websites.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Plug-in              JavaScript is aimed squarely at people who have learned              basic HTML  and perhaps a little CSS  but are interested              in doing more. For more details please <a href=              'http:  pluginjavascript.com' target='New'>visit the              website .                                     window.onload = function    {     Hide 'window'      x =  GetWindowWidth    - 330    2     y =  GetWindowHeight   - 245    2       S 'window' .border = 'solid 2px'     Position 'window', ABS      PopDown 'window', 'fade', null, null, 1, false      Resize 'window', 330, 245        S 'click' .cursor       = 'pointer'     S 'image' .paddingRight = Px 10      S 'content' .border     = 'solid 1px'     S 'content' .textAlign  = 'justify'       O 'click' .onclick = function       {        BrowserWindow 'window', 'header', 'close', x, y, true,           'fade', null, null, 500, false      }  }     The HTML section starts by creating a div that you can click to raise the pop-up.   Underneath this is a table with three sections: a header, a close button, and a content section.  The   section of code starts by calculating the correct coordinates to place the  pop-up in the center of the browser, gives the pop-up a solid border of 2 pixel’s width, and  uses the Position   plug-in to give the pop-up a style position of ‘absolute’, which  releases is from its place within the HTML so that it can be moved anywhere within the  document. You can use a style position of ‘fixed’ if you prefer to limit the pop-up to  staying only within the browser’s viewport into the document.  The PopDown   plug-in is then called with a value of 1 millisecond to quickly hide the  pop-up away. It’s important to use the transition type of ‘fade’ to later pop the window up  because the transition types must match or you will get strange errors.  The window is then resized to ensure that it is of set dimensions and, to prevent content   overflowing from the pop-up, its overflow style property is set to ‘hidden’.      C h a p t e r   8 :   M e n u s   a n d   N a v i g a t i o n    255  Next, four style properties are set to give the first div a mouse pointer cursor, to give a  little padding to the image, to provide a 1 pixel border between the header and the content,  and to set the text to full justification. None of these things are necessary, but they are  included to show how you can add a little styling from JavaScript as easily as you can from  a   section of HTML.  Finally, the onclick event of the div is set to call the BrowserWindow   plug-in.  Note  Because I used a table as the container object for this pop-up, it does not handle the ‘deflate’   or ‘zoom’ transitions at all well, since table dimensions are fixed and will not collapse on  demand. If you wish to create a pop-up window that uses either of these transition types, you will  need to build your container object using divs, spans, and CSS.

For example, you can enable text scrolling, either to the left or right, and you  can choose how many times the scroll should repeat and its speed.  There are also typewriter and “matrix” effects to make text appear and disappear, as   well as color fading text, flying text into position, and even fancy ripple effects for drawing  attention to important text.    70  TextScroll   With this plug-in, you can scroll selected text either left or right at a speed of your choosing  and for a set number of times. Figure 9-1 shows two phrases. The top one is scrolling left over  the course of three seconds, and the bottom is scrolling right over a period of one second.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object that contains text and then scrolls it. It requires the following  arguments:   	  id   	  dir    An object, object ID, or array of objects and or object IDs   The direction of scrolling, either ‘left’ or ‘right’   	  number   	  msecs    The number of times to repeat the scroll, with 0 indicating infinite repeats   The number of milliseconds a full scroll should take  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  copy  len  freq  iid  ctr1, ctr2  innerText  textContent  TS_Flag  LT  Math.round    substr    SetInterval    clearInterval    DoTextScroll    Html    Local variable for iterating through id if it is an array Local copy of the HTML contents if id Local variable containing the length of copy Local variable containing the period in milliseconds between each call  to DoTextScroll   Local counters for counting the characters in a string and the number  of scroll iterations Local variable returned from the call to setInterval  , to be used  when calling clearInterval   Property of id in non-Firefox browsers containing the object’s text Property of id in Firefox browsers containing the object’s text Property of id that is true when a scroll is in progress on it Global variable with the value ‘left’ Function to turn a floating point number into an integer Function to return a substring Function start repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Subfunction to perform the text scrolling Plug-in to return the HTML content of an object      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    259  Figure 9-1  Scrolling text is easy with this plug-in.  How It Works This plug-in begins by iterating through id if it is an array, recursively calling itself to  individually deal with each element, like this:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         TextScroll id[j], dir, number, msecs      return  }  The TS_Flag property of id is then tested. If it’s true, a scroll is already operating on  the object so the function returns. Otherwise, the property is set to true to indicate that a  scroll is in action on the id, as follows:  if  O id .TS_Flag  return  else O id .TS_Flag = true  Next, some local variables are set up to hold the text content of id, the length of the text,   the frequency at which the DoTextScroll   subfunction must be called in order for the  scroll to take msecs milliseconds, a couple of counters and, finally, the repeating interrupts  are set up with a call to setInterval  , with these statements:  var copy = Html id   var len  = copy.length  var freq = Math.round msecs   len   var ctr1 = 0  var ctr2 = 0  var iid  = setInterval DoTextScroll, freq   The DoTextScroll Subfunction This function is called repeatedly at a frequency that will ensure that a full scroll of the text  will take msecs milliseconds. It first determines whether to scroll left or right by checking the  dir argument and then modifying the string copy accordingly. If scrolling left, characters are       260   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     removed from the beginning of the string and added to the end. If scrolling right, characters  are removed from the end of the string and added to the beginning, like this:  if  dir == LT  copy = copy.substr 1  + copy[0]  else           copy = copy[len - 1]  + copy.substr 0, len - 1   Another test must then be made due to differences between browsers. If the browser   supports the innerText property of an object, then that is assigned the value in copy;  otherwise, the textContent property is assigned the value, as follows:  if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText = copy  else               O id .textContent = copy  Next, an if   statement increments ctr1. If the incremented value equals the value    in len, then the contents of the statement are executed because a full scroll has completed;  otherwise, the function returns to be called again in freq milliseconds. The code looks   like this:  Inside the statement, ctr1 is reset to 0, ready for the next scroll  if there is one . Then   ctr2 is incremented in another if   statement. If that value equals the one in the argument  number, all scrolling is complete, and the TS_Flag property of id is set to false and the  repeated interrupts are stopped with a call to clearInterval  , like this:  if  ++ctr1 == len   {  ctr1 = 0    if  ++ctr2 == number   {     O id .TS_Flag = false     clearInterval iid   }  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you pass it an object, such as a div or span that has some text in it, tell it  whether to scroll left or right, and decide how many times the scroll should repeat and how  long it should take.  Here’s an example that creates two divs with different sentences in the HTML section,  and then in the   section scrolls them in different directions, a different number of  times, and at differing speeds:      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.      My hovercraft is full of eels.            window.onload = function         C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    261  {     TextScroll 't1', LT, 2, 1000      TextScroll 't2', RT, 1, 2000   }     The divs have IDs of t1 and t2, respectively, and the LT and RT arguments are global   variables with the values ‘left’ and ‘right’.  The Plug-in function TextScroll id, dir, number, msecs   {      if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            TextScroll id[j], dir, number, msecs         return     }       if  O id .TS_Flag  return     else O id .TS_Flag = true       var copy = Html id      var len  = copy.length     var freq = Math.round msecs   len      var ctr1 = 0     var ctr2 = 0     var iid  = setInterval DoTextScroll, freq        function DoTextScroll       {        if  dir == LT  copy = copy.substr 1  + copy[0]        else           copy = copy[len - 1]  + copy.substr 0, len - 1           if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText = copy        else               O id .textContent = copy          if  ++ctr1 == len         {           ctr1 = 0             if  ++ctr2 == number            {              O id .TS_Flag = false              clearInterval iid            }        }     }  }      262   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s       71  TextType   This plug-in emulates an old-fashioned typewriter or a teletype machine by outputting the  text contents of an object one character at a time, over a period of time specified by you.  Figure 9-2 shows a phrase being displayed with this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object that contains text and then displays it one character at a time. It  requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object, object ID, or array of objects and or object IDs   	  number   	  msecs    The number of times to repeat the process, with 0 indicating infinite repeats   The number of milliseconds it should take to type out the text  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  html  len  freq  iid  str  ctr1, ctr2  innerText  textContent  TT_Flag  Math.round    substr    SetInterval    clearInterval    Html    DoTextType    Local variable that iterates through id if it is an array Local variable containing the HTML content of id Local variable containing the length of html Local variable containing the period in milliseconds between each call  to DoTextScroll   Local counters for counting the characters in a string and the number  of scroll iterations Local variable returned from the call to setInterval  , to be used  when calling clearInterval   Substring of html used for displaying the characters so far “typed” Property of id in non-Firefox browsers containing the object’s text Property of id in Firefox browsers containing the object’s text Property of id that is true when a call to TextType   is already in  progress on it Function to turn a floating point number into an integer Function to return a substring Function to start repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Plug-in to return the HTML content of an object Subfunction to perform the “typing”      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    263  Figure 9-2  You can emulate a teletype machine or typewriter with this plug-in.  How It Works This plug-in begins by iterating through id if it is an array, recursively calling itself to  individually process each element, like this:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         TextType id[j], number, msecs      return  }  The TT_Flag property of id is then tested. If it’s true, a call to this plug-in is already   operating on the object, so it returns. Otherwise, the property is set to true to indicate that a  call is in progress on the id, as follows:  if  O id .TT_Flag  return  else O id .TT_Flag = true  Next, some local variables are set up to hold the text content of id, the length of the text,   the frequency at which the DoTextType   subfunction must be called in order for the  typing to take msecs milliseconds, a couple of counters and, finally, the repeating interrupts  are set up with a call to setInterval  , with these statements:  var html = Html id   var len  = html.length  var freq = Math.round msecs   len   var ctr1 = 0  var ctr2 = 0  var iid  = setInterval DoTextType, freq   The DoTextType   Subfunction This function starts by assigning the characters so far typed to the local variable str. Next,  an underline character is placed at the end to simulate a cursor, like this:  var str = html.substr 0, ctr1  + '_'      264   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     After that, the ctr1 counter is tested against the value in len. If they match, the text has   completed being typed; otherwise, there is more yet to be typed, so ctr1 is incremented,  like this:  if  ctr1++ == len   {  Inside the if   statement, ctr1 is reset to 0 ready for the next repeat  if there is one  and   ctr2 is incremented within another if   statement and compared with the value in the  number argument. If they match, then all repeats have finished and the TT_Flag property of  id is set to false, the repeating interrupts are cancelled with a call to clearInterval  ,  and the final underline character  which was previously appended to str  is stripped from it  using a call to substr  , as follows:  ctr1 = 0    if  ++ctr2 == number   {     O id .TT_Flag = false     clearInterval iid      str = str.substr 0, len   }  Next, because different browsers use different properties for the value, if the browser   supports the innerText property, it is assigned the value in str; otherwise, the textContent  property of id is assigned the value, like this:  if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText   = str  else                 O id .textContent = str  Then the function returns and, if the repeating interrupts have not been cleared, it will   be called up again in another freq milliseconds.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, put some text in a container, such as a div or span, and pass that container  to the plug-in along with the number of repeats required and the length of time it should take  to complete the typing.  Here’s a simple example that types out a simple phrase once, over a period of five   seconds:       The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.            window.onload = function    {     TextType 'text', 1, 5000   }         C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    265  The Plug-in function TextType id, number, msecs   {      if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            TextType id[j], number, msecs         return     }       if  O id .TT_Flag  return     else O id .TT_Flag = true       var html = Html id      var len  = html.length     var freq = Math.round msecs   len      var ctr1 = 0     var ctr2 = 0     var iid  = setInterval DoTextType, freq        function DoTextType       {        var str = html.substr 0, ctr1  + '_'          if  ctr1++ == len         {           ctr1 = 0              if  ++ctr2 == number            {              O id .TT_Flag = false              clearInterval iid               str = str.substr 0, len            }        }          if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText   = str        else                 O id .textContent = str     }  }    72  MatrixToText   This plug-in provides an effect similar to the one used in the Matrix movies to make text  slowly appear from a random collection of characters. Figure 9-3 shows some text halfway  through being revealed using this plug-in.      266   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 9-3  This plug-in creates an interesting text reveal effect.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object containing some text and replaces it with random characters,  then slowly changes them to reveal the original text. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object, object ID, or array of objects and or object IDs   	  msecs    The number of milliseconds it should take to reveal the text  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  html  len  freq  matrix  count  chars  iid  innerText  textContent  innerHTML  INTERVAL  MT_Flag  Local variable that iterates through id if it is an array Local variable containing the HTML content of id Local variable containing the length of html Local variable containing the period in milliseconds between each call  to DoMatrixTotext   Local string variable originally containing scrambled text Local variable for counting the steps of the transformation Local string variable containing all the upper- and lowercase letters  and the digits 0 to 9 Local variable returned form the call to setInterval  , to be used  when calling clearInterval   Property of id in non-Firefox browsers containing the object’s text Property of id in Firefox browsers containing the object’s text Property of id containing its HTML Global variable with the value 30 Property of id that is true when a call to MatrixToText   is  already in progress on it      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    267  substr    Math.round    Math.floor    Math.random    SetInterval    clearInterval    Html    DoMatrixToText    Function to return a substring Function to turn a floating point number into an integer, rounding the  number up or down, whichever is closest Function to turn a floating point number into an integer, always  rounding the number down Function to return a random number between 0 and 1 Function to start repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Plug-in to return the HTML of an object Function to reveal the original text  How It Works This plug-in begins by iterating through id if it is an array, recursively calling itself to  individually process each element, like this:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         MatrixToText id[j], msecs      return  }  The MT_Flag property of id is then tested. If it’s true, a call to this plug-in is already   operating on the object, so it returns. Otherwise, the property is set to true to indicate that   a call is in progress on the id, as follows:  if  O id .MT_Flag  return  else O id .MT_Flag = true  Next, html is given the HTML contents of id, len its length, and freq the frequency   with which the DoMatrixToText   subfunction needs to be called in order for the transition  to take msecs milliseconds. In addition, the string variable matrix is created, which will  hold the random text as it is slowly revealed; count, the counter for each step, is initialized  to 0; and chars, the string containing all possible characters for scrambling the text, is  populated with the characters a–z, A–Z and 0–9, as follows:  var html   = Html id   var len    = html.length  var freq   = Math.round msecs   INTERVAL   var matrix = ''  var count  = 0  var chars  = 'ABCDEFGHIHJKLMOPQRSTUVWXYZ' +               'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' +               '0123456789'      268   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Next, a for   loop iterates through each character in html, replacing it with a random   character from chars  if it is not a newline or space , like this:  for  var j = 0 ; j < len ; ++j   {     if  html[j] == '\n'  html[j] == ' '  matrix += html[j]     else matrix += chars[Math.floor Math.random   * chars.length ]  }  The value in matrix is then assigned to either the innerText or textContent   property of id, according to which one is supported by the current browser, and the regular  interrupts to the subfunction that will perform the reveal are set up, like this:  if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText   = matrix  else                 O id .textContent = matrix  var iid = setInterval DoMatrixToText, freq   The DoMatrixToText   Subfunction This function does the revealing by using a for   loop each time it is called up to replace  len   20 characters in the string matrix with the correct values. This is sufficient to change  only enough for each step, so that the transition will take msecs milliseconds, as follows:  for  j = 0 ; j < len   20 ; ++j   {     var k  = Math.floor Math.random   * len      matrix = matrix.substr 0, k  + html[k] + matrix.substr k + 1   }  The value of 20 was determined by performing several tests with strings of different   sizes and timing them. It’s not an exact value, so you might find you want to tweak it. The  new value in matrix is then assigned to the correct property of id in order to display it:  if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText   = matrix  else                 O id .textContent = matrix  Finally, the count variable is incremented within an if   statement. If the new value is  the same as INTERVAL, the transition has completed, so the MT_Flag property of id is set to  false to indicate that the transition is over. Its innerHTML property is then restored to its  original value, and the repeating interrupts are cancelled, like this:  if  ++count == INTERVAL   {     O id .MT_Flag = false     O id .innerHTML = html     clearInterval iid   }  The function then returns and, if there are still characters to be revealed, it is called up   again in freq milliseconds time, and so forth, until the transition has finished.

It takes  some text and slowly scrambles it over a period of time specified by you. Figure 9-4 shows  some text that has been fully scrambled with this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object containing some text and replaces it with random characters  over a time period you specify. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object, object ID, or array of objects and or object IDs   	  msecs    The number of milliseconds it should take to scramble the text  Figure 9-4  This plug-in slowly scrambles text over a specified length of time.

You may also notice that I omitted the interruptible argument to FadeOut  .   Therefore, this passes a value of ‘undefined’ for that argument to the function, which will   be treated as if it was the value false and so it saves on typing.

Figure 9-5 shows two elements  that have been set to fade colors. The first continuously alternates between yellow and blue  text and background colors, while the second fades from black to light blue when the mouse  is passed over it.  About the Plug-in This plug-in changes the text or background color of the contents of an object over a specified  period of time. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs   	  color1   	  color2    The start color expressed as a six-digit hexadecimal number   The end color expressed as a six-digit hexadecimal number    The property to change, either ‘text’ for the text color, or ‘back’  or anything   what other than ‘text’  for the background color msecs   	   	   	  number repeats    The number of milliseconds the transition should take   The number of times the transition should repeat, with 0 meaning infinite   Figure 9-5  This plug-in is great for banners and mouseover highlights.      274   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  step  index  count  direc  cols[]  steps[]  prop  iid  temp  CF_Flagtext  CF_Flagback  INTERVAL  DoColorFade    ZeroToFF    DecHex    setInterval    clearInterval    Math.round    Math.max    Math.min    Local variable that indexes into id if it is an array, and for splitting the  colors into triplets Local variable containing the amount of change between each  transition frame Local variable used as a multipliers fort generating color values Local variable containing a counter for counting the repeats Local variable containing the direction of color change, either 1 or –1 Local array containing the ‘from’ color triplets Local array containing the step between each color triplet Local variable containing the property to change either color or  backgroundColor Local variable containing the value returned by setInterval  , to be  used later by clearInterval   Local variable used for building up each transition color Property of id that is true if a color change transition is in effect on it Property of id that is true if a background color change transition is  in effect on it Global variable with the value 30 Subfunction to perform the color changes Sub-subfunction to ensure values are integers between 0 and 255   equal to 00 to FF hexadecimal  Plug-in to convert a decimal value to hexadecimal Function to set up repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Function to turn a floating point number into an integer Function to return the maximum of two values Function to return the minimum of two values  How It Works This function starts by iterating through id if it is an array, recursively calling itself to  process each element individually, like this:   if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         ColorFade id[j], color1, color2, what, msecs, number      return  }      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    275  Next, a pair of flags are checked to see whether a fade is already in process on id. If the   argument what has the value ‘text’, then the CF_Flagtext property of id is tested or set.  Otherwise, if it is ‘back’, its CF_Flagback property is tested or set, like this:  if  O id ['CF_Flag' + what]   {     if  !O id ['CF_Int' + what]  return     else clearInterval O id ['CF_IID' + what]   }  else O id ['CF_Flag' + what] = true  If a fade is running and the plug-in is not set to interruptible, the plug-in returns;   otherwise, any current repeating interrupts are halted, ready for new ones to be set up. If  the flag is not set, it is assigned the value true to indicate that a fade is in progress.  After this, if either of the colors was passed without the preceding required  character,   it is added:  if  color1[0] == ''  color1 = color1.substr 1   if  color2[0] == ''  color2 = color2.substr 1   Next, various local variables are assigned values that will be used later:  var step  = Math.round msecs   INTERVAL   var index = 0  var count = 0  var direc = 1  var cols  = []  var steps = []  The last five are simple initializations, while the first one gives step a value that will  calculate the difference between transition frames so that the whole effect will take msecs  milliseconds.  After this, the cols[] array is populated with the triplet color values, and the steps[]   array with the step values for each triplet between each frame, like this:  for  var j = 0 ; j < 3 ; ++j   {        var tmp  = HexDec color2.substr j * 2, 2          cols[j]  = HexDec color1.substr j * 2, 2          steps[j] =  tmp - cols[j]    step   }  The local variable prop is then assigned a property name, either color or   backgroundColor, depending on the value in the argument what:  if  what == 'text'  var prop = 'color'  else      var prop = 'backgroundColor'  This is what makes the plug-in dual functional: either the foreground or background   color will be changed.      276   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Finally, in the setup section of code, the value in interruptible is saved, and the   setInterval   function is called to set up repeating interrupts to the DoColorFade    subfunction every INTERVAL milliseconds. The value returned by the function is then stored  in CF_IID to be used later when clearInterval   is called:  O id ['CF_Int' + what] = interruptible  O id ['CF_IID' + what] = setInterval DoColorFade, INTERVAL   The DoColorFade Subfunction This function starts off by preparing the variable temp with an initial  character to start a  color string. A for   loop then iterates through the cols[] array, calculating the current  frame’s color values, converting them to hexadecimal, and then appending them to temp.  After that, the value in temp is assigned to the property of id stored in prop:  var temp =''    for  var j = 0 ; j < 3 ; ++j      temp += DecHex ZeroToFF cols[j] + index * steps[j]      S id [prop] = temp  After this, the index variable is incremented by the value in direc. If direc is 1, index   increases by 1; if it is –1, it decreases by 1, like this:  if   index += direc  > step  index < 0   If the new value of index is either greater than step or less than 0, the transition is  complete, so the following code is executed to reverse the direction of fade by negating  direc. Then, if all repeats are finished, it cancels the repeating interrupts:  direc = -direc    if  ++count == number   {     O id ['CF_Flag' + what] = false     clearInterval iid   }  The ZeroToFF   Sub-subfunction This function takes the value passed to it in num and uses the Math.max   function to  ensure it is not less than 0, the Math.min   function to ensure it isn’t greater than 255, and  the Math.round   function to turn it into an integer, like this:  return Math.round Math.min 255, Math.max 0, num     How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it an object, such as a div or span that contains some text; provide  starting and ending values in strings such as ‘123456’; decide whether to change the text or       C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    277  background color by setting an argument for what of ‘text’ or ‘back’; choose a length of time  in milliseconds for the transition; and finally, decide how many times you want the transition  to repeat.  Here’s an example that uses the plug-in in two different ways. One highlights some text   by constantly transitioning it between the two colors supplied, and the other reacts to  onmouseover and onmouseout events to fade between the two colors:                              New - See our latest offers!              Mouseover Me                          window.onload = function    {     ColorFade 't', 'ffffff', '0000ff', 'text', 2000, 0      ColorFade 't', 'ff0000', 'ffff00', 'back', 2000, 0        O 'm' .onmouseover = function   { fade '000000', '0088ff'  }     O 'm' .onmouseout  = function   { fade '0088ff', '000000'  }       function fade a, b      {        ColorFade 'm', a, b, 'text', 200, 1       }  }     The text section creates two spans with the IDs ‘t’ and ‘m’. In the   section, the   first two commands set both the background and text colors of ‘t’ to transition between  yellow  ‘ffff00’  and blue  ‘0000ff’ . Because a number argument of 0 is passed, the  transitions continue infinitely.  Below this, the ‘m’ span has its onmouseover and onmouseout events attached to a   small function called fade   that calls ColorFade   with a number argument of 1, so that  each transition happens only once. This means that when the mouse passes over, the color  fades to light blue  ‘0000ff’ , and when the mouse moves away it fades back to black   ‘000000’ .  Pass your mouse over the second span to see the smooth fading mouseover effect you   can achieve for links and other elements.  Note  Odd transitions change the color of an object from the first to the second color, while even  ones change it back again. This means that number argument values of 1, 3, 5, and so on will  leave the second color on display, while 2, 4, 6, and so on will restore the first color after all  transitions are over.      278   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Plug-in function ColorFade id, color1, color2, what, msecs, number, interruptible   {      if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            ColorFade id[j], color1, color2, what, msecs, number         return     }       if  O id ['CF_Flag' + what]      {        if  !O id ['CF_Int' + what]  return        else clearInterval O id ['CF_IID' + what]      }     else O id ['CF_Flag' + what] = true       if  color1[0] == ''  color1 = color1.substr 1      if  color2[0] == ''  color2 = color2.substr 1        var step  = Math.round msecs   INTERVAL      var index = 0     var count = 0     var direc = 1     var cols  = []     var steps = []       for  var j = 0 ; j < 3 ; ++j      {        var tmp  = HexDec color2.substr j * 2, 2          cols[j]  = HexDec color1.substr j * 2, 2          steps[j] =  tmp - cols[j]    step     }       if  what == 'text'  var prop = 'color'     else      var prop = 'backgroundColor'       O id ['CF_Int' + what] = interruptible     O id ['CF_IID' + what] = setInterval DoColorFade, INTERVAL        function DoColorFade       {        var temp =''          for  var j = 0 ; j < 3 ; ++j            temp += DecHex ZeroToFF cols[j] + index * steps[j]            S id [prop] = temp          if   index += direc  > step  index < 0         {           direc = -direc         C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    279           if  ++count == number            {              O id ['CF_Flag' + what] = false              clearInterval O id ['CF_IID' + what]            }        }          function ZeroToFF num         {           return Math.round Math.min 255, Math.max 0, num           }     }  }    75  FlyIn   With this plug-in, you can make text  or any object  fly into its position in a document from  any location you choose and at whatever speed you wish. Figure 9-6 shows a list of five  items set to fly in from the bottom of the browser, one per second over the course of five  seconds.  About the Plug-in This plug-in flies an object into its final location over a time you specify. It requires these  arguments:  id  	 x 	      An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs If specified, the relative horizontal offset at which the animation should start—   it may be a positive or negative value  y 	    If specified, the relative vertical offset at which the animation should start—   it may be a positive or negative value msecs   	    The number of milliseconds the animation should take  Figure 9-6   Instead of having static objects, why not fly them in at the start?      280   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j tox, toy fromx, fromy  xstep, ystep  count  ABS  FI_Flag  setInterval    clearInterval    DoFlyIn    Position    GoTo  Local variable to iterate through id if it is an array Local variables containing the original  and final  location of id Local variables containing the start location of id for the  animation Local variables containing the amount by which to move id in   each frame Local variable to count the animation frames Global variable with the value ‘absolute’ Property of id that is true if a fly-in is already in progress on it Function to start repeating interrupts Function to end repeating interrupts Subfunction to perform the animation Plug-in to set the style position property of an object Plug-in to move an object to a new location  How It Works This plug-in starts by using j to iterate through id if it is an array and recursively calling  itself to individually process each element:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         FlyIn id[j], x, y, msecs      return  }  Next, the FI_Flag property of id is checked. If it is true, a fly-in is already in progress  on the object so it returns. Otherwise, the property is given the value true to indicate that   a fly-in is running on id, like this:  After that, the various local variables that will be used by the DoFlyIn   subfunction   if  O id .FI_Flag  return  else O id .FI_Flag = true  are set up, as follows:  var tox   = X id   var toy   = Y id   var fromx = tox + x  var fromy = toy + y  var xstep = x    msecs   INTERVAL   var ystep = y    msecs   INTERVAL   var count = 0      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    281  The variables tox and toy save the current location of the object as a record of where to   fly it into. The start location for the animation is then placed in fromx and fromy, the step  value for each dimension of each frame is stored in xstep and ystep, and the counter  count is initialized.  Finally, in the setup section, the id object is released from the HTML and given a style   position property of ‘absolute’, using the global variable ABS. This allows it to be moved  anywhere within the document. Next, the setInterval   function is called to start  repeating interrupts to the DoFlyIn   subfunction every INTERVAL milliseconds. The  result of calling the function is saved in iid to be used later when clearInterval     is called:  Position id, ABS   var iid = setInterval DoFlyIn, INTERVAL   The DoFlyIn   Subfunction This function simply uses the GoTo   plug-in to move id to each location in the animation,  like this:  GoTo id, fromx - xstep * count, fromy - ystep * count   An if   statement then checks count to see whether it has a value greater than or   equal to msecs   INTERVAL. If it does, the fly-in has completed and the following code is  executed, but whether it does or doesn’t equal that value, count is incremented after the  test is made, like this:  if  count++ >= msecs   INTERVAL   {  If the fly-in has finished, the FI_Flag property of id is set to false to indicate this,   GoTo   is called to ensure that id is placed at exactly the correct location  because xstep  and ystep will usually be floating point values and the final values calculated using them  could be off by a pixel or two . Then the repeating interrupts are stopped with a call to  clearInterval  , like this:  O id .FI_Flag = false  GoTo id, tox, toy   clearInterval iid   The function then returns and, if the fly-in hasn’t yet finished, it will be called again in   INTERVAL milliseconds, and so on until the animation has completed.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it an object and specify where you wish the object to fly in from by  providing relative horizontal and vertical coordinates in the next two arguments. You also  have to tell the plug-in how long the animation should take in milliseconds.      282   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Here’s an example that flies some list elements up from the browser bottom, with each   arriving at its destination one second after the one above it:   How to become a millionaire:        Win the lottery         Inherit the money         Marry a millionaire         Become a movie or pop star         Invest $130 month in stocks for 40 years!             window.onload = function    {     h = GetWindowHeight         FlyIn 'a', 0, h, 1000      FlyIn 'b', 0, h, 2000      FlyIn 'c', 0, h, 3000      FlyIn 'd', 0, h, 4000      FlyIn 'e', 0, h, 5000   }     In case you were wondering, statistically the stock market has returned 11 percent on  average per year over the last several decades. And, according to any compound interest  calculator, $130 invested every month over 40 years, and at an average of 11% interest per  year, will return a gross amount of $1,007,490.02, before taxes and fees.  Of course inflation will eat away at that amount, approximately halving its actual value   each decade, so the final amount in today’s money would probably be closer to $250,000,  pre tax and fees. Still, it’s not bad for having invested only $62,400 in total. By the way,   I am not an investment advisor and this doesn’t constitute advice for you to make any  investments.  But I digress, so back to the HTML part of the example. This HTML section creates a   simple list and places its element within spans. The   section then places the height  of the browser into the variable h and issues five calls to FlyIn   with the different object  IDs, a start location just under the bottom of the screen, and animation periods from 1 to   5 seconds.  You can just as easily fly the elements in from the browser top by specifying a y value of   –20 or so, or from the left or right edges by using values of -W 'object'  -50 for the x  argument when flying form the left, or GetWindowWidth   for the x argument if flying in  from the right. In fact, you can specify any relative x and y coordinates you like so objects  can fly in at any angle.  tip  Because objects have to be given a style position property of ‘absolute’ in order to move them   about, if you have not enclosed the object  or a set of objects  in a suitable container with set  dimensions such as a div or span, other elements of the HTML could move themselves to fill in  the space previously occupied by the object  or objects . Tables are also good place holders for  objects that you will be flying in.

Figure 9-7  shows the list elements from the previous plug-in, FlyIn  , but here they have their  onmouseover events attached to this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in performs a wave or ripple effect from the start to end of text contained within  an object. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object, object ID, or an array of objects and or object IDs   	  number   	  msecs    The number of times to repeat the ripple—infinite, if number is 0   The number of milliseconds the ripple should take      284   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 9-7  This plug-in provides a great effect for drawing people’s attention.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  html  len  freq  iid  temp  ctr1, ctr2  innerHTML  innerText  textContent  TR_Flag  Local variable used for iterating through id if it is an array Local variable containing the HTML content of id Local variable containing the length of html Local variable containing the time between each call to  DoTextRipple   in milliseconds, such that the ripple will take  msecs milliseconds to complete Local variables for counting each character in a ripple, and each  repeat of the animation respectively Local variable containing the result of calling setInterval   to  be used later when calling clearInterval   Local variable that holds the HTML for each step of the animation Property of id containing its HTML Property of id in non-Firefox browsers containing its text content Property of id in Firefox browsers containing its text content Property of id which is true when a ripple is in process on it      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    285  Html    InsVars    DoTextRipple    setInterval    clearInterval    substr    Plug-in to return the HTML content of an object Plug-in to insert values into a string Subfunction to perform the animation Function to set up repeating interrupts Function to stop repeating interrupts Function to return a substring  How It Works This plug-in starts by using j to iterate through id if it is an array and recursively calling  itself to individually process each element:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         TextRipple id[j], number, msecs      return  }  Next, the TR_Flag property of id is checked. If it is true, a ripple is already in progress  on the object and it returns. Otherwise, the property is given the value true to indicate that  a ripple is running on id, like this:  if  O id .TR_Flag  return  else O id .TR_Flag = true  After that, the local variable html is given a copy of the HTML content of id; len is set  to its length; freq is assigned the time in milliseconds between each call to DoTextRipple    such that the ripple will take msecs milliseconds; two counters, ctr1 and ctr2, are initialized;  and setInterval   is called to set up repeating interrupts to the DoTextRipple    subfunction every freq milliseconds, like this:  var html = Html id   var len  = html.length  var freq = msecs   len  var ctr1 = 0  var ctr2 = 0  var iid  = setInterval DoTextRipple, freq   The variable iid is given the value returned by setInterval  , which will be used   later when clearInterval   is called.  The DoTextRipple   Subfunction This function starts off by assigning temp the left hand part of html, prior to any font size  changes, with ctr1 indexing the point at which the fonts will be manipulated:  var temp = html.substr 0, ctr1       286   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Next, each character in html that will have its font size changed is processed within a  for   loop such that the outside characters of the group are the smallest, the ones just in  from them are larger, and the largest one is in the center, as follows:  for  var j = 0 ; j < 7 ; ++j      temp += InsVars " 2 ",        4 - Math.abs j - 3 , html.substr ctr1 + j, 1    The part that determines this is 4 - Math.abs j - 3 , which, for the values 0 through   6 of j, gives the following font size values  because the Math.abs   function makes all  negative numbers positive :  1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Once all the font sizes have been calculated and stored in temp using the InsVars     plug-in to insert the values into a string containing   statements, the  innerHTML property of id is assigned this string to display it, along with the remaining,  unchanged portion of html:  Html id, temp + html.substr ctr1 + j    An if   statement then increments ctr1 and checks whether it equals the value in len.   If so, the animation has finished and the code following is executed:  if  ++ctr1 == len   {  If the ripple is finished, then ctr1 is reset and another if   statement checks whether   there are any more repeats of the interrupt remaining, like this:  ctr1 = 0    if  ++ctr2 == number   {     if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText = html     else               O id .textContent = html       O id .TR_Flag = false     clearInterval iid   }  If the repeats have finished, the value in html is saved back into id as text, not HTML    Otherwise, unwanted extra HTML tags would be added by the browser—the time for  saving HTML to the property is only when the font sizes are being changed .  Next, the TR_Flag property of id is set to false to indicate that all ripples have   completed, and the clearInterval   function is called to stop any future calls to the  subfunction, passing it the value previously stored in iid.  The function then returns but will be called up again in freq milliseconds if there are   still outstanding animation frames to display.  How To Use It To use this animation, pass it an object, such as a div or span containing only text with no  HTML markup or other tags; tell it the number of times to repeat the ripple; and give it the  length of time in milliseconds that the animation should take.      C h a p t e r   9 :   t e x t  ef f e c t s    287  Here’s an example that takes the list from the FlyIn   plug-in and attaches each entry   to an onmouseover event to trigger the ripple:   How to become a millionaire:        &nbsp;          Win the lottery         &nbsp;          Inherit the money         &nbsp;          Marry a millionaire         &nbsp;          Become a movie or pop star         &nbsp;          Invest $130 month in stocks for 40 years!             window.onload = function    {     O Array 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' , 'onmouseover', ripple        function ripple       {        TextRipple this, 1, 500      }  }     To prevent the text from moving down on the page as the larger characters in a ripple   increase its height, each line on which a ripple can be triggered has the html <font  size='+4'>&nbsp;  immediately preceding it. This ensures that the height of the  line is always set to the maximum +4 size of font used by the plug-in. You can also use CSS  styling, tables, and other methods to enclose lines that will be rippled and prevent them  moving themselves or other elements about.  The   section passes an array of the objects to the O   plug-in, along with the  ‘onmouseover’ event name as a string, and the name of the function ripple below it. The  ripple function then uses the this keyword, which acts as a pseudo object representing  the object that triggered the event. This saves having to pass arguments to the function,  keeping the code short and simple.  The Plug-in function TextRipple id, number, msecs   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            TextRipple id[j], number, msecs         return     }         288   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     if  O id .TR_Flag  return     else O id .TR_Flag = true       var html = Html id      var len  = html.length     var freq = msecs   len     var ctr1 = 0     var ctr2 = 0     var iid  = setInterval DoTextRipple, freq        function DoTextRipple       {        var temp = html.substr 0, ctr1           for  var j = 0 ; j < 7 ; ++j            temp += InsVars " 2 ",              4 - Math.abs j - 3 , html.substr ctr1 + j, 1             O id .innerHTML = temp + html.substr ctr1 + j         if  ++ctr1 == len         {           ctr1 = 0             if  ++ctr2 == number            {              if  O id .innerText  O id .innerText = html              else               O id .textContent = html                O id .TR_Flag = false              clearInterval iid            }        }     }  }   Chapter 10  audio and Visual effects      290   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     In this chapter, there are a number of handy plug-ins you can use for creating light boxes   and slide shows  or combining the two , making rotating billboards for placing advertising    or news updates, or making objects pulsate as you pass the mouse over them. There are also plug-ins to help you create professional looking charts with the help of   Google Charts, present YouTube videos in a variety of ways with a single function call, and  play sounds in response to events or for any other reason.    77  Lightbox   With this plug-in you can display an image or any object in the center of the browser with  the outside darkened and made transparent by amounts you can specify. Your users can  then view these objects with minimum distraction and simply click them to dismiss the  light box. Figure 10-1 shows a photograph being displayed using this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in displays a photo  or other object  centered in the browser, with a darkened  frame over the web page behind it.

This is so that  they can both be moved about and otherwise modified without these actions being seen by  the user.  After that, the frame is moved to the top left of the browser and resized to fill the entire   window, and its zIndex property is set to the highest value used so far  held in ZINDEX ,  like this:  S document.body .overflow = HID  Hide Array id, 'LB_DIV'    Locate 'LB_DIV', ABS, 0, 0   Resize 'LB_DIV', GetWindowWidth  , GetWindowHeight     S 'LB_DIV' .zIndex = ZINDEX  Having set up the frame, id is processed next by setting its opacity to 0, which releases   it from the HTML by calling Position   to set its style position attribute to ‘absolute’.  Next, its zIndex is set to a value that is 1 higher than the frame’s, and the ZINDEX global  variable is also incremented to contain this higher value:  Opacity id, 0   Position id, ABS   S id .zIndex = ++ZINDEX  With both objects now prepared, the Show   plug-in is called to re-enable the objects in   the browser, and id is centered. Next, the new div  with the ID ‘LB_DIV’  is faded to the  value in opacity over msecs milliseconds, id is faded in to an opacity of 100, and the  background color of the frame is faded between col1 and col2 over the same time period,  like this  remembering that FadeIn   fades an object from 0 percent to 100 percent opacity :  Show Array id, 'LB_DIV'    Center id   Fade 'LB_DIV', 0, opacity, msecs   FadeIn id, msecs, 0   ColorFade 'LB_DIV', col1, col2, 'back', msecs, 1   Finally, in the display section of code, the onclick event of id is set to call up the   DismissLB   subfunction when clicked, as follows:  O id .onclick = DismissLB      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     293  The DismissLB   Subfunction This function is called whenever id is clicked. The first thing it does is fade the frame’s  opacity back down to 0 and its background color from col2 back to col1, like this:  Fade 'LB_DIV', opacity, 0, msecs   ColorFade 'LB_DIV', col2, col1, 'back', msecs, 1   At the same time, a chain is created to perform three actions in sequence: first, fade out   id; second, hide id; and third, restore any scrollbars to document.body, as follows:  Chain Array      InsVars "FadeOut Array '1', 'LB_DIV' , 2, 0 ", id, msecs ,     InsVars "Hide Array '1', 'LB_DIV'  ", id ,     "S document.body, 'overflow', 'auto' "  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you need to have an image  or any other object  already prepared. Most  likely you will also have set its style.display attribute to ‘none’ so that it is not visible in  the web page, like this:     Next you can attach the plug-in to an event such as an onclick or onmouseover to pop   the object up in a light box. Here’s an example that uses an onclick event:   Click Me           window.onload = function    {     O 'link' .onclick = function       {        Lightbox 'photo', '888888', '000000', 80, 500, 1      }  }     The HTML section of this example creates a button with a link to the anonymous inline   function, along with an image object with the ID ‘photo’. The   section simply  contains the function that calls up the Lightbox   plug-in.  When a light box is in use, none of the elements underneath it that are usually clickable    or have onmouseover events attached  will work until the light box is removed. This is  because the div object it creates covers the entire browser window and has a higher zIndex  value than everything except the light box contents, which makes it especially useful when  you wish to force the user to focus only on one thing, such as entering log-in details or  accepting notification of an error, and so on.      294   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Tip  The reason for requiring the two color arguments of col1 and col2 is to allow for web pages of  any color background, which can then be faded to any other color of your choice for the light box  frame. If your website has standard black text on a white background, I recommend you try  fading the light box between the color values 888888  midgray  and 000000  black . Or, you  can be creative and fade between contrasting colors for an even more eye-catching effect. The  value you choose for the opacity argument will also greatly change the transition effect.  The Plug-in function Lightbox id, col1, col2, opacity, msecs   {     S id .cursor = 'pointer'       if  !O 'LB_DIV'       {        var newdiv = document.createElement 'div'         newdiv.setAttribute 'id', 'LB_DIV'         document.body.appendChild newdiv      }       S document.body .overflow = HID     Hide Array id, 'LB_DIV'       Locate 'LB_DIV', ABS, 0, 0      Resize 'LB_DIV', GetWindowWidth  , GetWindowHeight        S 'LB_DIV' .zIndex = ZINDEX       Opacity id, 0      Position id, ABS      S id .zIndex = ++ZINDEX       Show Array id, 'LB_DIV'       Center id      Fade 'LB_DIV', 0, opacity, msecs      FadeIn id, msecs, 0      ColorFade 'LB_DIV', col1, col2, 'back', msecs, 1        O id .onclick = DismissLB          function DismissLB       {        Fade 'LB_DIV', opacity, 0, msecs         ColorFade 'LB_DIV', col2, col1, 'back', msecs, 1         Chain Array            InsVars "FadeOut Array '1', 'LB_DIV' , 2, 0 ", id, msecs ,           InsVars "Hide Array '1', 'LB_DIV'  ", id ,           "S document.body, 'overflow', 'auto' "               }  }      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     295     Figure 10-2  With this plug-in,  one image fades  into another    78  Slideshow   With this plug-in, you can display a sequence of images in a slide show. Figure 10-2 shows  this plug-in being used in conjunction with the previous plug-in, Lightbox  , to create a  slide show on a darkened background.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an empty container such as a div or span and displays a continuously  rotating sequence of images that fade into each other. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID—this may not be an array   	   	   	  msecs  images    An array of images  preferably of the same dimensions    The time each fade transition should take in milliseconds   The time in milliseconds  to wait between each transition—if this value is set   wait to the string ‘stop’, it tells the plug-in to stop any current slide show and exit  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  index  newimg  SS_Stop SS_IMG1, SS_IMG2  src  Local variable used for indexing the array of images Local variable containing a new image object Property of id which, if true, stops the slide show Object IDs of the two new image objects Property of each image object containing its source file      296   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     ABS  setTimeout    DoSlideshow    Locate    Opacity    FadeIn    FadeBetween    createElement    setAttribute    appendChild    Global variable with the value ‘absolute’ Function to set up an interrupt to a function after a specified period Subfunction to perform the fade transitions Plug-in to set an object’s style position property and move it to   a new location Plug-in to set an object’s opacity Plug-in to center an object in the browser Plug-in to fade between two objects Function to create a new HTML element Function to set an attribute of an HTML element Function to append a child HTML element  How It Works This plug-in begins by setting len to the number of items in images and setting the SS_Stop  attribute of id to either true or false, depending on whether the wait argument contains  the string ‘stop’. If it does, the value true is assigned so the subfunction will know to stop  the fade transitions. The line of code looks like this:  var len       = images.length  O id .SS_Stop =  wait == 'stop'  ? true : false  As well as checking the wait arguments to see if it has the value ‘stop’, the SS_Flag   property of id is tested; if it is true, a slide show is already in operation on this id, so the  following code is not executed:  if  !O id .SS_Stop && !O id .SS_Flag   Otherwise, as long as the wait argument contains a number, the previous code is then   entered.  Here, if there is no object with the ID ‘SS_IMG1’, this is the first time the plug-in has   been called, so it populates the id container object with two new image objects having the  IDs ‘SS_IMG1’ and ‘SS_IMG2’. It then overlays these objects over each other by locating the  second one in the same position as the first, like this:  var newimg = document.createElement 'img'   newimg.setAttribute 'id', 'SS_IMG1'   O id .appendChild newimg     newimg = document.createElement 'img'   newimg.setAttribute 'id', 'SS_IMG2'   O id .appendChild newimg     Locate 'SS_IMG2', ABS, 0, 0   These lines illustrate how you can add new elements to a DOM tree at any point. First,   use document.createElement   to create a new element object, then set any attributes       C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     297  using setAttribute  , and finally, use appendChild   to append the new element to   the DOM.  Next, the variable index is initialized to 0; this will be used later to index the next image  in a slide show. The first image object is then assigned the contents of the first element in the  images array, which will be the location of a photo or other image:  var index        = 0  O 'SS_IMG1' .src = images[0]  O id .SS_Flag    = true  Opacity 'SS_IMG2', 0   FadeIn 'SS_IMG1', msecs, 0   The SS_Flag property is also set to true to indicate that a slide show is in progress.   After that, the second image has its opacity is set to 0 to make it invisible, and the first  image is faded in over a period of msecs milliseconds:  Finally, in the setup section of code, the setTimeout   function is called to set up    an interrupt to call the DoSlideshow   subfunction after a period of msecs + wait  milliseconds. This accounts for the time it will take the first image to fade in, plus the time  required for the wait:  setTimeout DoSlideshow, msecs + wait   The DoSlideshow   Subfunction The job of this function is to transition a fade between two images and then initiate an  interrupt to call itself again when the next transition is due  unless it is cancelled .  The first thing this function does is load the first image with the current value in the  images array, as indexed by index. The first time it calls this, nothing happens since the  same image has already been loaded. However, on all future transitions it has the effect of  taking the picture that is being displayed in the second image and duplicating it in the first,  so that they both are showing the same picture:  O 'SS_IMG1' .src = images[index]  Since both images are showing the same picture, it is safe to set the first one to be fully   visible and the second one to invisible, like this:  Opacity 'SS_IMG1', 100   Opacity 'SS_IMG2', 0   Having made this swap, the index variable is incremented to point to the next picture   in the slide show and, if it becomes larger than the number of images in the images array, it  is reset to 0  using the % operator  to start again at the beginning, as follows:  index = ++index % len  Next, it’s time to load in the next picture listed in the images array into the second   image, because the first image is the one currently being displayed, and the second has been  made invisible ready to do this:  O 'SS_IMG2' .src = images[index]      298   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     I will explain the following statement shortly, but here it is for reference:  var next = InsVars "O 'SS_IMG1' .src = '1'",     images[ index + 1  % len]   Now that each image holds a different picture, it’s a simple matter to call the   FadeBetween   plug-in to fade between the two, like this:  FadeBetween 'SS_IMG1', 'SS_IMG2', msecs, next   This makes the second image the visible one and the first one invisible. At this point, the   image states are the same as at the start of the subfunction.  The value of the next argument in the FadeBetween   call is a string containing a   callback function, which is mostly used by chains to link them together. However, in this  case it is just passing a statement to be executed once the plug-in completes its work.  The contents of next, which I previously glossed over, creates a statement that will load  the next picture in the slide show into the first image once the fade between the two images  is finished and the first image is now invisible  and available for use in this way .  This is done to preload the picture so that it is cached in the browser and, next time   round the loop, when the picture is loaded into image 2, it will be fetched from the cache  without any delays while it is downloaded from the server.  This means program execution is ready to go round the loop again. However, the next   interrupt call to the subfunction is only set up if the SS_Stop property of id is false,  because if it is true then a call has been made requesting the slide show to stop:  if  !O id .SS_Stop  setTimeout DoSlideshow, msecs + wait   Otherwise, if the slide show is stopped, the SS_Flag property of id is set to false to   indicate this:  else O id .SS_Flag = false  How To Use It To use this plug-in, prepare an empty div or span and pass it to the plug-in along with an  array containing the URLs of the images for the show and two timers: the first for how long  each fade transition should take and the second for the length of pause between changing  images, both in milliseconds.  Here’s an example that combines this plug-in with the previous one, Lightbox  , to   create a slide show in a light box:   Click Me            window.onload = function    {     Resize 'show', 320, 240      Hide 'show'      photos = Array 'photo1.jpg', 'photo2.jpg',        'photo3.jpg', 'photo4.jpg', 'photo5.jpg'          C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     299     O 'link' .onclick = function       {        Slideshow 'show', photos, 500, 2000         Lightbox 'show', '888888', '000000', 80, 500, 1      }  }     In the HTML section, a button is created that will call the anonymous, inline function   when clicked, while underneath it there’s an empty div. In the   section, the div is  resized  with a call to Resize    to the dimensions required so that the Slideshow    function can center it correctly—without these dimensions, if the contents of the div is not  ready when the Center   call is made, the object might appear off center.  The div is also hidden with a call to Hide   because now that it has dimensions it will   push any content below it out of the way. Then the array photos is populated with the  URLs of five photos, and the function calls both Slideshow   and Lightbox   to merge  the two plug-ins together.  Because the Lightbox   plug-in dismisses its contents when you click it, the slide show   will not stop, even though it isn’t visible. If you click the button again, the Slideshow    plug-in will realize that it is still running and simply continue the slide show.  If you want to turn the slide show off, you need to set the SS_Stop property of ‘show’   to 1 or true, and the next time a slide change is due it will stop:  O 'show' .SS_Stop = true  Tip  This plug-in is designed so that you can place the containing object anywhere you like and the  slide show will occur at that position; you don’t have to use it in a light box if you don’t want to.  The Plug-in function Slideshow id, images, msecs, wait   {     var len       = images.length     O id .SS_Stop =  wait == 'stop'  ? true : false       if  !O id .SS_Stop && !O id .SS_Flag      {        if  !O 'SS_IMG1'          {           var newimg = document.createElement 'img'            newimg.setAttribute 'id', 'SS_IMG1'            O id .appendChild newimg              newimg = document.createElement 'img'            newimg.setAttribute 'id', 'SS_IMG2'            O id .appendChild newimg              Locate 'SS_IMG2', ABS, 0, 0        }         300   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s           var index        = 0        O 'SS_IMG1' .src = images[0]        Opacity 'SS_IMG2', 0         FadeIn 'SS_IMG1', msecs, 0         setTimeout DoSlideshow, msecs + wait      }       function DoSlideshow       {        O 'SS_IMG1' .src = images[index]        Opacity 'SS_IMG1', 100         Opacity 'SS_IMG2', 0           index = ++index % images.length        O 'SS_IMG2' .src = images[index]        var next = InsVars "O 'SS_IMG1' .src = '1'",            images[ index + 1  % len]         FadeBetween 'SS_IMG1', 'SS_IMG2', msecs, 0, next           if  !O id .SS_Stop  setTimeout DoSlideshow, msecs + wait         else O id .SS_Flag = false     }  }    79  Billboard   This plug-in is similar to the Slideshow   plug-in in that it fades between objects in a  sequence. The difference is that the Billboard   plug-in allows you to put any objects in   a show, and they must already exist in the document  whereas the Slideshow   plug-in  pulls images in by their URLs only when needed .  A great use for this plug-in is to rotate banners or other advertisements, which can be   images, divs, spans, or other objects. Figure 10-3 shows one image in a sequence being  displayed using this plug-in.     Figure 10-3  This plug-in creates  a billboard of  rotating objects  and or images.      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     301  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a containing object such as a div or span and an array of objects held  within it, which it then rotates like an automated billboard. It requires the following  arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID—this cannot be an array   	   	   	   	  random    An array of objects or object IDs If true, the objects will be displayed in random order  objects     The time in milliseconds that each fade between objects should take   The time in milliseconds to wait before fading to the next object  msecs  wait  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  len  index  h  rand  BB_Ready  BB_Stop  REL  FadeOut    FadeIn    Locate    H    DoBillboard    setTimeout    clearTimeout    slice    Math.floor    Math.random    Local variable used as an index to iterate through the objects array Local variable containing the number of items in the objects array Local variable used to reference each object to be displayed Local variable containing the cumulative height of each object for  locating them in their required locations Local variable containing a random number between 0 and len – 1 Property of id that is true if the objects have already been  positioned in their places Property of id that is true if the billboard rotation is disabled Global variable with the value ‘relative’ Plug-in to fade out an object Plug-in to fade in an object Plug-in to apply a style position and location to an object Plug-in to return an object’s height Subfunction to rotate the contents of the billboard Function to set up an interrupt to a function in the future Function to stop any timeout that has been set Function to return a portion of an array Function to turn a floating point number into a rounded down integer Function to return a random number  How It Works This plug-in begins by setting the local variable len to the number of items in the objects  array:  var len = objects.length      302   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Next, it checks whether it has already been called by examining the BB_Ready property  of id. If it is not true, then the objects have not yet been moved to their required locations,  so the following code is executed, which begins with setting up some variables.  First len is assigned the number of items in objects, and then the O id .BB_Index   property of id and the local variable h are initialized to 0, like this:  var h          = 0  O id .BB_Index = 0  After setting up the local variables, the BB_Ready property of id is set to true so that  future calls to the plug-in will know that the objects have been properly located. Then all  items in objects other than the first are faded out by passing them through the slice    function to split them off, and a value of 1 millisecond is used for the transition to make it  virtually instantaneous. This has the effect of leaving only the first item visible:  O id .BB_Ready = true  FadeOut objects.slice 1 , 1, 0   After that, a for   loop iterates through all but the first item in objects, subtracting   the height of each previous object from the local variable h. Each object is then released from  its position in the web page and given a style position attribute of ‘relative’  using the global  variable REL .  Each object’s x coordinate is set to 0 to line it up with the left-hand side of the first one,   and its y coordinate is set to h, which is a negative number containing the sum of all the  heights of the objects above the current one, thus moving the object up the browser and  placing it directly on top of the first one:  for  j = 1 ; j < len ; ++j   {     h -= H O objects[j-1]       Locate O objects[j] , REL, 0, h   }  Next, if the wait argument has the value ‘stop’, the BB_Stop property of id is set to  true, indicating that the billboard transitions should stop; otherwise, it is assigned the  value false:  O id .BB_Stop =  wait == 'stop'  ? true : false  After that, as long as BB_Stop is not true and as long as the billboard is not already   running  the BB_Flag property of id will be true if it is , an interrupt is set to call the  DoBillboard   subfunction in msecs + wait milliseconds:  if  !O id .BB_Stop && !O id .BB_Flag      O id .BB_IID = setTimeout DoBillboard, msecs + wait   The result returned by the call is placed in the BB_IID property of id for used when   calling clearTimeout  .      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     303  The DoBillboard   Subfunction This function starts by setting the BB_Flag property of id to true to indicate that the  billboard is running:  It then checks the BB_Stop property of id to see whether it can continue or should stop:  O id .BB_Flag = true  if  O id .BB_Stop   {     O id .BB_Flag = false     clearTimeout O id .BB_IID      return  }  If BB_Stop is true, then a request has been made to stop the transition, so the function  will reset BB_Flag to false, stop any timeout that is due, and return. No more interrupts  will occur on it, unless the plug-in is called again—at which time the transitions pick up  from where they left off. This allows you to, for example, pause the transitions if the mouse  passes over an object and resume them again when it leaves.  Otherwise, the function continues running and the next thing to happen is the currently   displayed object gets faded out:  else FadeOut objects[O id .BB_Index], msecs, 0   Then, if the argument random is true  or 1 , the subsequent object to display should be   selected at random, which is done by this code:  var rand = O id .BB_Index   while  rand == O id .BB_Index       rand = Math.floor Math.random   * len   O id .BB_Index = rand  Here rand is assigned the value of the O id .BB_Index property, which points to the  currently displayed object. Then a while   statement repeatedly selects random numbers,  placing them in the variable rand, until it is not the same as O id .BB_Index. This ensures  that the next object displayed in the billboard won’t be the same as the current one.  Once a value is found, it is placed in O id .BB_Index. Otherwise, if random is not true,   the objects are displayed in sequential order and O id .BB_Index is incremented. If it  becomes greater than the number of items in the objects array, it is reset to 0  using the %  operator :  else O id .BB_Index = ++O id .BB_Index  % len  At this point, O id .BB_Index represents the next object to be displayed, so a call is   made to the FadeIn   plug-in to fade it in:  FadeIn objects[O id .BB_Index ], msecs, 0       304   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Finally, any currently pending interrupt is cancelled and another interrupt is set up to  call the subfunction again in msecs + wait milliseconds, giving enough time for both the  fade transition and the wait period to pass:  clearTimeout O id .BB_IID   O id .BB_IID = setTimeout DoBillboard, msecs + wait   How To Use It To use this plug-in, you need to first prepare a containing object to hold all the items that  will be rotated in the billboard. Then place the subobjects within it, and you’re ready to call  the plug-in from JavaScript.  Here’s an example that combines the divs used in Plug-in 67, RollOver  , with a new   image of the same dimensions:           <img id='p1' src='palace.png' align='left' style=     'padding-right:10px'>For sale: 600 room, 300 year old central London     house, located close to all the amenities, right in the heart of     Westminster city.         <img id='p2' src='plan.png' align='right' style=     'padding-left:10px'>829,818 sq ft: Historical setting, famous     residents, exquisitely decorated throughout. Phone 555 1234 for more     details.                     window.onload = function    {     S 'billb' .border = 'solid 1px'     Resize 'billb', 320, 100      objects = Array 'b1', 'b2', 'b3'      Resize objects, 320, 100      S objects, 'background.Color', 'ffffff'      Show 'billb'      Billboard 'billb', objects, 1, 500, 3000        O 'billb' .onmouseover = pause     O 'billb' .onmouseout  = resume       function pause       {        Billboard 'billb', '', '', '', 'stop'      }       function resume       {       C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     305        Billboard 'billb', objects, 1, 500, 3000      }  }     I laid out the HTML so that you can clearly see the three subobjects within the main   containing object  with the ID ‘billb’ , which has its style display attribute set to ‘hidden’ so  as not to show the subobjects.  In the   section, the containing object is given a solid 1-pixel border  which is  not necessary but improves the look  and resized it to 320 by 100 pixels. The subobjects are  then also resized to those dimensions so that all elements are the same, then Show   is  called to re-enable the displaying of the container div, and then the Billboard   plug-in is  called to start things.  Next, the onmouseover and onmouseout events of ‘billb’ are attached to the functions  pause   and resume  . The pause   function needs only to pass the argument names of  ‘billb’ to reference the container object and the value ‘stop’ in the wait argument. In this  instance, all other arguments will be ignored, so they have been set to the empty string. The  resume   function, however, should be identical to the initial call made to start the billboard  in the first place.  As you pass your mouse over the billboard it will stop rotating, but it will resume once  you move it away. Of course, the objects in this example are not linked to anything, but you  will probably use this plug-in for advertising and make them clickable; you can even  include forms within the objects.  NoTe  To place all the subobjects in the same location, they must start off lined up underneath each  other in the browser. In the case of divs, this will already be the case, but spans and images may  require a   tag placed after them to ensure the correct positioning. The Billboard    plug-in then subtracts the height of all previous objects to place each consecutive one over the  first. Should you forget to line them all up this way, some of the objects will not display correctly,  if at all.  The Plug-in function Billboard id, objects, random, msecs, wait   {     var len = objects.length       if  !O id .BB_Ready      {        var h          = 0        O id .BB_Index = 0          O id .BB_Ready = true        FadeOut objects.slice 1 , 1, 0           for  j = 1 ; j < len ; ++j         {           h -= H O objects[j-1]         306   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s              Locate O objects[j] , REL, 0, h         }     }       O id .BB_Stop =  wait == 'stop'  ? true : false          if  !O id .BB_Stop && !O id .BB_Flag         O id .BB_IID = setTimeout DoBillboard, msecs + wait        function DoBillboard       {        O id .BB_Flag = true          if  O id .BB_Stop         {           O id .BB_Flag = false           clearTimeout O id .BB_IID            return        }        else FadeOut objects[O id .BB_Index ], msecs, 0           if  random         {           var rand = O id .BB_Index            while  rand == O id .BB_Index                rand = Math.floor Math.random   * len            O id .BB_Index = rand        }        else O id .BB_Index = ++O id .BB_Index  % len          FadeIn objects[O id .BB_Index ], msecs, 0         O id .BB_IID = setTimeout DoBillboard, msecs + wait      }  }    80  GoogleChart   Among many other products, Google offers a great program for creating and displaying  charts. However, to make the best use of it there are many options you need to set up and a  lot of documentation to be read. This plug-in distills the main features of the service into a  set of basic arguments you can pass to it, making the service extra easy to use. Figure 10-4  shows the plug-in being used to display a 3-D pie chart.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a container such as a div or span and inserts an image into it, which it  fetches from the Google Charts service. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID—this cannot be an array   	  title   	  tcolor    The chart title   The title color      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     307     Figure 10-4  This plug-in makes  it easy to create  charts from  collections of data.   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  tsize    The title font size   The type of chart, any of ‘line’, ‘vbar’, ‘hbar’, ‘gometer’, ‘pie’, ‘pie3d’, ‘venn’,   type or ‘radar’—see Table 10-1 for more details  and see Figure 10-5 for some example  chart types  bwidth    The bar width if the chart is a bar chart   A string of data labels, separated by  characters   A string of data legends, separated by  characters   A string of colors, one for each item of data, in six digit hex values,   legends  labels  colors separated by commas bgfill    The background fill color as a six-digit hex string   	  data    The data, as a string of numeric values, separated by commas  Table 10-1  The  Supported Values for  the type Argument  and the Charts They  Create  Type value ‘line’ ‘vbar’ ‘hbar’ ‘gometer’ ‘pie’ ‘pie3d’ ‘venn’ ‘radar’  Chart type Standard line chart Vertical bar chart Horizontal bar chart Google Go Meter Standard pie chart 3D pie chart Venn diagram Radar chart      308   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     100  90  30  30  35  40  March  February  50 Kb  April  January  Bar Chart  3D Pie Chart  Apr  May Line Chart  June  100  80  60  40  20  0  0  315  270  45  90  0  25  50  Scatter Chart  75  100  225  135  180  Radar Chart  Compound Chart  Figure 10-5  Some of the chart types supported by Google Charts  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  types  t1  t2  tail  innerHTML  UNDEF  escape    Local associative array used to turn values in the type argument into the  keywords required by Google Charts Local variable containing the escaped title Local variable containing the type of chart as a Google Charts keyword Local variable containing the query string for sending to Google Property of id containing its HTML Global variable containing the string ‘undefined’ Function to escape a string, making it suitable for use in a query string  How It Works This plug-in begins by populating the associative array types with the eight types of chart  names as used by the plug-in and their corresponding keywords, as passed on to Google  Charts, like this:  var types =  {     'line'    : 'lc',     'vbar'    : 'bvg',     'hbar'    : 'bhg',     'gometer' : 'gom',     'pie'     : 'p',     'pie3d'   : 'p3',     'venn'    : 'v',     'radar'   : 'r'  }      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     309  Next, the type argument is tested to see if it has a value. If not, it is given the value   ‘pie’, which, therefore, becomes the default for when no type is given:  if  typeof type == UNDEF  type = 'pie'  Then title is passed through the escape   function to make it suitable for passing in   a query string URL tail, and title is then placed in the variable t1. Meanwhile, the  keyword for the chart type to send to Google is looked up by referencing the type  argument in the types array, as follows  such that if, for example, type has the value  ‘hbar’, t2 will be assigned the value ‘bhg’, and so on :  var t1 = escape title   var t2 = types[type]  After this, a selection of arguments that are required for most charts  such as the chart’s   title, width, height, and so on  are assembled into the variable tail, each separated by an  &amp; entity, like this:  var tail = 'chtt='         + t1           + '&amp;cht='     + t2           + '&amp;chs='     + width + 'x' + height           + '&amp;chbh='    + bwidth           + '&amp;chxt=x,y'           + '&amp;chd=t:'   + data  Then, if values for them have been passed to the plug-in, a set of five if   statements   adds other arguments to tail:  if  tcolor && tsize  tail += '&amp;chts='     + tcolor + ',' + tsize  if  labels           tail += '&amp;chl='      + labels  if  legends          tail += '&amp;chdl='     + legends  if  colors           tail += '&amp;chco='     + colors  if  bgfill           tail += '&amp;chf=bg,s,' + bgfill  With tail now containing the completed query string, it is appended to the Google   Charts URL and then placed in an   tag, which is then assigned to the HTML of id:  Html id, "<img src='http:  chart.apis.google.com chart?" +     tail + "'  >"   This results in the chart displaying within the id container object.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, start with an empty div, span, or other container that has an innerHTML  property, and then pass this object along with all the required parameters to the plug-in, as  in this example:           window.onload = function         310   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     {     title   = 'My Favorite Types of Cheese'     tcolor  = 'FF0000'     tsize   = '20'     type    = 'pie3d'     width   = '530'     height  = '230'     bwidth  = ''     labels  = 'StiltonBrieSwissCheddarEdamColbyGorgonzola'     legends = labels     colors  = 'BD0000,DE6B00,284B89,008951,9D9D9D,A5AB4B,8C70A4,FFD200'     bgfill  = 'EEEEFF'     data    = '14.9,18.7,7.1,47.3,6.0,3.1,2.1'       GoogleChart 'chart', title, tcolor, tsize, type, bwidth, labels,        legends, colors, bgfill, width, height, data        Resize 'chart', width, height      S 'chart' .border = 'solid 1px'  }     To simplify this example, all the arguments have been separately assigned to variables,   which are then passed to the plug-in. Also, the containing div is resized to the width and  height of the chart and is given a 1-pixel, solid border. This results in a fully self-contained  div, displaying the chart as returned by Google. You can get more information about Google  Charts at code.google.com apis chart .  Tip  The Google Charts API has a limit of 50,000 calls per day from each website, so if your site is  making that many calls or more, you should run the plug-in once in your browser, right-click,  save the image, and upload it to your web server. That way, you can display it as often as you like  using   tags.  The Plug-in function GoogleChart id, title, tcolor, tsize, type, bwidth,     labels, legends, colors, bgfill, width, height, data   {     var types =     {        'line'    : 'lc',        'vbar'    : 'bvg',        'hbar'    : 'bhg',        'gometer' : 'gom',        'pie'     : 'p',        'pie3d'   : 'p3',        'venn'    : 'v',        'radar'   : 'r'     }         C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     311     if  typeof type == UNDEF  type = 'pie'       var t1                     = escape title      var t2                     = types[type]     var tail                   = 'chtt='          + t1                                + '&amp;cht='      + t2                                + '&amp;chs='      + width  + 'x' + height                                + '&amp;chbh='     + bwidth                                + '&amp;chxt=x,y'                                + '&amp;chd=t:'    + data       if  tcolor && tsize  tail += '&amp;chts='     + tcolor + ',' + tsize     if  labels           tail += '&amp;chl='      + labels     if  legends          tail += '&amp;chdl='     + legends     if  colors           tail += '&amp;chco='     + colors     if  bgfill           tail += '&amp;chf=bg,s,' + bgfill       Html id, "<img src='http:  chart.apis.google.com chart?" +        tail + "'  >"   }    81  PlaySound   This plug-in lets you play a sound as a result of a mouse move or button event, a keyboard  event, or any other reason. Figure 10-6 reintroduces the avatars used in previous chapters,  but this time their onmouseover events are attached to this plug-in.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an empty container such as a div or span and embeds an audio player in  it to play a sound. It requires the following arguments:   	  id    An object or object ID—this cannot be an array   	   	  file    The URL of an audio file, generally a WAV or similar file    If ‘true’, the sound will loop continuously; if ‘stop’, it will stop a previously   loop playing sound; any other value will play the sound once     Figure 10-6  When you pass the  mouse over these  images, a sound  will play.      312   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  innerHTML  Resize    Locate    InsVars    Property of id containing its HTML Plug-in to resize an object Plug-in to set an object’s style position and location Plug-in to insert values into a string  How It Works This plug-in first resizes id so that it has no width or height and then gives it an ‘absolute’  style position so that it cannot affect any other objects in the web page, like this:  Resize id, 0, 0   Locate id, ABS, 0, 0   Next, if the argument loop contains the string value ‘stop’, then any currently playing   sound is stopped by setting the innerHTML property of id to the empty string, thus  removing any previously embedded sound player:  if  loop == 'stop'  O id .innerHTML = ''  Otherwise, the innerHTML property of id is assigned the correct HTML to embed a   sound player and auto start the sound playing, looping it if loop contains the string value  ‘true’, like this:  else O id .innerHTML =     InsVars "<embed src='1' hidden='true' " +        "autostart='true' loop='2'  >", file, loop   How To Use It Playing a sound is as easy as passing an empty container such as a div or span to the plug-in,  along with the URL of the sound to play and, if required, the value ‘true’ in the argument  loop. Here’s an example that attaches the plug-in to the onmouseover events of four  images:                         window.onload = function    {     ids = Array 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'a4'      O ids, 'onmouseover', bloop        function bloop         C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     313     {        PlaySound 'sound', 'bloop.wav', 0      }  }     NoTe  This plug-in relies on the browser having a plug-in of its own already installed to play   sounds, which is true in the majority of cases. Browsers without a sound plug-in will simply  ignore this code. Also, there may be a slight delay before some sounds begin playing, so this plug- in works best when immediate playback is not essential. If you do need instant sounds, the most  robust way to accomplish this is probably to write a Flash script, or obtain a Flash sound player  and embed it. Also, small files will play quicker than large ones.  The Plug-in function PlaySound id, file, loop   {     Resize id, 0, 0      Locate id, ABS, 0, 0        if  loop == 'stop'  O id .innerHTML = ''     else O id .innerHTML =        InsVars "<embed src='1' hidden='true' " +           "autostart='true' loop='2'  >", file, loop   }    82  EmbedYouTube   With this plug-in, you can forget about all the HTML and other code needed to display a  YouTube video because it’s all handled for you with a single function call. Figure 10-7 shows  the Emmy Award winning movie Dr Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog being played using this plug-in.     Figure 10-7  Displaying YouTube  videos is easy with  this plug-in.      314   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     About the Plug-in This plug-in returns the HTML code required to embed a YouTube video. It requires the  following arguments:   	  video   	  width    A YouTube video identifier such as ‘apEZpYnN_1g’ , height  The width and height at which to display the video   	  hq      	  full   	  auto  If ‘true’  and it is available , the video is played in high quality      If ‘true’, the video is allowed to be viewed in full screen mode If 1, the video starts playing automatically  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  temp  InsVars    Local variable containing the HTML to display the video Plug-in to insert values into a string  How It Works This plug-in begins by assigning to hq the query string to use to display a video in high  quality  if the argument hq is 1 or true ; otherwise, it is assigned the empty string:  if  hq  hq = '&amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18'  else    hq = ''  The next four lines of code account for when one or both of the width or height   arguments are omitted, assigning sensible default values to them that will display a video  in a 4:3 aspect ratio, if required:  if  width && !height  height = width  * 0.7500  if  !width && height  width  = height * 1.3333  if  !width            width  = 425  if  !height           height = 324  This means that, for example, if you want a video to be 300 pixels wide you can enter   that for the width, and set the height to '', and that empty value will be calculated for you   it will be set to 225 in this case .  I will gloss over the remaining statements as they simply build the string variable temp   using the various HTML parameters required and then return the string.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, you need to have prepared a container object such as a div or span and  then pass this, along with the result of calling the plug-in, to the Html   plug-in to insert  the HTML code into the object. The following example shows how:           window.onload = function         C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     315  {     Html 'movie', EmbedYouTube 'apEZpYnN_1g', 320, 240,        'true', 'true', 1    }     All you have to decide is the width and height for the video and whether to allow high  quality, full screen, and auto starting. At the most basic, you can issue a simple call such as  the following to place the video in a web page, ready for the user to click its Play button:  Html 'movie', EmbedYouTube 'apEZpYnN_1g'    The Plug-in function EmbedYouTube video, width, height, hq, full, auto   {     if  hq  hq = '&amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D18'     else    hq = ''       if  width && !height  height = width  * 0.7500     if  !width && height  width  = height * 1.3333     if  !width            width  = 425     if  !height           height = 324          var temp = InsVars " "      +        "<param name='movie' value='http:  www.youtube.com v " +        "3&amp;fs=1&amp;autoplay=45'>", width, height, video,        auto, hq        temp += InsVars " <param name='allowFullScreen' "  +        "value='1'> <param name='allowscriptaccess' "  +        "value='always'> ", full        temp += InsVars "<embed src='http:  www.youtube.com"      +        " v 1&amp;fs=1&amp;autoplay=23' type='application " +        "x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' "       +        "allowfullscreen='true'", video, auto, hq              temp += InsVars "width='1' height='2'>  ",        width, height        return temp  }    83  PulsateOnMouseover   With this plug-in, you can create an onmouseover hover effect for an object that slowly fades  it in and out again, over a time and by an amount you specify. Figure 10-8 shows the same  image attached to this plug-in using three different levels of fading and transition times.      316   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 10-8  Attach this plug-in  to an object and it  will pulsate when  the mouse passes  over it.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes an object and attaches to its onmouseover and onmouseout events to  create a pulsating effect. It requires the following arguments:   	  id   	  op1   	  op1    An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs   The default opacity for the object, between 0 and 100   The opacity to which the object should be faded, between 0 and 100   	  msecs    The number of milliseconds each full cycle should take  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  finish  faded  iid  FA_Level  FA_Flag  onmouseover  onmouseout  PulseateOn    DoPulsate    Fade    setInterval    clearInterval    Local variable used to index into id if it is an array Local variable set to true if the pulsating stops Local variable set to true when the object is faded  or fading , otherwise  false Local variable assigned the result of calling setInterval   to be used  later when clearInterval   is called Property of id used by the Fade   plug-in to set its opacity Property of id used by the Fade   plug-in and set to true to indicate  that a fade transition is in progress, otherwise it is false or ‘undefined’ Event attached to id triggered when the mouse passes over Event attached to id triggered when the mouse passes out Subfunction that sets up the main variables Sub-subfunction that performs the transitions Plug-in to fade an object from one opacity level to another Function to set up repeating interrupts to another function Function to stop the repeating interrupts      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     317  How It Works This plug-in begins by checking whether id is an array. If it is, it iterates through it and  recursively calls itself, separately passing each element of the array to be processed  individually, like this:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            PulsateOnMouseover id[j], op1, op2, msecs      return  }  Next, the variable finish is set to false—it will later be set to true whenever the   mouse passes out of an object and the pulsating has to stop. The iid variable is also  declared, which will be used to store the value returned by the setInterval   function:  After this, the opacity of id is set to the level in the argument op1, to which the FA_Level  property of id is also set. This property is used by the Fade   plug-in, but this plug-in needs  to access it in order to know when an object has faded in or out by the correct amount:  var finish = false  var iid  Opacity id, op1   O id .FA_Level = op1  Finally, in the setup section, the mouse events of id are attached to the PulsateOn    subfunction for starting the pulsations, and to an inline, anonymous function that sets the  variable finish to true when the mouse moves away from an object, like this:  O id .onmouseover = PulsateOn  O id .onmouseout  = function   { finish = true }  The PulsateOn   Subfunction This function’s job is to set up the variables required prior to calling the DoPulsate   sub- subfunction. It first declares the variable faded and assigns it the value of false, indicating  that the object is faded in—it will be true when it is faded out. The finish variable is also  set to false in case the plug-in has been restarted after having been previously stopped:  var faded = false  finish    = false  If the variable iid has a value, a previous call has been made to the plug-in, so it is   passed to the clearInterval   function to stop any repeating interrupts that may  currently be in place. After that, setInterval   is called to set up repeating interrupts to  the DoPulsate   plug-in every INTERVAL milliseconds, like this:  if  iid  clearInterval iid   iid = setInterval DoPulsate, INTERVAL       318   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The DoPulsate   Sub-subfunction This function is where the pulsating is made to occur. and it is in two parts: one for fading  out and the other for fading in. The first part checks the faded variable and, if it is not  true, the object is not faded out. Next it checks the FA_Level property of id and, if it is the  same as the value in op1, then id is at its default opacity and is ready to be faded out. Here  is the line of code that performs these two tests:  if  !faded && O id .FA_Level == op1   Inside the if   statement, a further check is made to see whether the finish variable   has been set to true. If it has, rather than fade the object out, it’s necessary to stop the  repeating interrupts, like this:  if  finish  clearInterval iid   When the function next returns, it will not be called up again unless a new set of   repeating interrupts is triggered by another onmouseover event.  However, if finish is not true, then it’s business as usual for the function, which   instigates a fade out by calling the Fade   plug-in with a final opacity value of op2. The  variable faded is also set to true to indicate that the object is faded or is in the process of  doing so, like this:  Fade id, op1, op2, msecs   2, 0   faded = true  The transition duration of msecs   2 is used because there are two transitions in each   full cycle, so each transition must take only half the value in msecs to complete.  In the second part of this function, if the variable faded is true, the FA_Flag property   of id is tested. This property is set to true by the Fade   plug-in whenever a fade  transition is in progress and is set to false once a transition has completed. If FA_Flag is  true, the function will return because a fade is in progress, and it must not be interrupted:  else if  !O id .FA_Flag   Otherwise, the code within the if   statement will be executed, as follows:  Fade id, op2, op1, msecs   2, 0   faded = false  Here a call to Fade   is made with a final opacity value of op1 to fade the object back to  its default opacity level, and the variable faded is set to false to indicate that the object is  faded in or is in the process of doing so.   How To Use It The plug-in is written so that it will always fade back to the default opacity for an object  when the mouse is moved away. To use it, attach it to any objects that you would like to  pulsate when the mouse passes over them. These can be images, divs, spans, or anything  that has an opacity property that can be changed.      C h a p t e r   1 0 :   au d i o   a n d   V i s u a l  ef f e c t s     319  Here’s an example that uses the same image three times, with each attached to the   plug-in using different arguments:                window.onload = function    {     PulsateOnMouseover 'a', 100, 66,  500      PulsateOnMouseover 'b', 66, 100,  750      PulsateOnMouseover 'c', 100,  0, 1000   }     The first image is set to pulsate between opacity levels of 100 and 66, so it will lighten by   a third and back again on each pulsation, over a duration of 500 milliseconds. The second  one starts with a default opacity level of 66 and a fade value of 100 so, rather than fade out,  it will in fact darken by about a third and lighten back again during each pulsation, which  will take three quarters of a second to complete. The final image simply fades between full  and zero opacity and back again over the course of a second.

It creates a new date object and sets it to the current time and date, like this:  var date = new Date    date.setTime date.getTime   + seconds * 1000   Saving a Cookie Next, the expires variable is given the correct value to make the cookie expire in seconds  seconds, the path variable is assigned the path on the server to which the cookie applies,  the domain and secure arguments are added  if they have values , and the cookie is set by  assigning these values to document.cookie, as follows:  var expires     = seconds ? '; expires=' + date.toGMTString   : ''  path            = path    ? '; path='    + path               : ''  domain          = domain  ? '; domain='  + domain             : ''  secure          = secure  ? '; secure='  + secure             : ''  document.cookie = name + '=' + escape value  + expires + path  Reading a Cookie In the next section, a cookie is read back from the computer, starting by checking whether or  not there are any existing cookies on the computer; if there are not, the value false is  returned:  if  !document.cookie.length  return false      324   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Otherwise, the cookie is looked up by setting the variable start to point to the string  containing the value in name followed by the = sign, by using a call to indexOf  . If it is  not found, a value of –1 is returned, so the value false is returned by the plug-in:  var start = document.cookie.indexOf name + '='   if  start == -1  return false  If both these tests pass, then the cookie has been found, so start is set to point to the   portion of the cookie string directly after the name and = sign:  start += name.length + 1  The variable end is then set to the end of the string by finding the character ; that   terminates all cookie strings bar the last one:  var end = document.cookie.indexOf ';', start    If it is not found, it means this was the last cookie and it is the end of the string. Therefore,  the following line of code returns either the location of the following ;, or the end of the string  and places it back in end:  end =  end == -1  ? document.cookie.length : end  Finally, the cookie value is returned:  return unescape document.cookie.substring start, end    Erasing a Cookie The code to erase a cookie makes use of a recursive call by passing the cookie name and   a value of the empty string, along with a time one minute in the past, back to itself with   an action argument of ‘save’:  ProcessCookie 'save', name, '', -60   How To Use It To use this plug-in, put the action in the action argument, which should be a value of  ‘save’, ‘read’, or ‘erase’, and then pass the cookie’s name and any other values needed.  For example, to set the cookie ‘password’ to the value ‘mypass’ with an expiry date of   one hour from now, you would use the following:  ProcessCookie 'save', 'password', 'mypass', 60 * 60, ' '   Once a cookie has been set, you can read it back like this:  value = ProcessCookie 'read', 'password', '', '', ' '   Or, you can delete a cookie like this:  ProcessCookie 'erase', 'password', '', '', ' '       C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    325  The final path argument specifies which part of the server the cookie applies to. The   value of ‘ ’ means that everywhere, from the document root upward, can access the cookie.  However, you can restrict the scope by, for example, changing the path to a subfolder such  as ‘ chat’. Or you can simply omit the argument to give the same scope as if it had the value  ‘ ’. If you do so, you can also shorten the calls used to read and erase the cookie, like this:  value = ProcessCookie 'read', 'password'   ProcessCookie 'erase', 'password'   Remember that the path  or no path  you use must be the same for all accesses to the   same cookie, otherwise you will not be able to reliably read and write it. Also, you will  probably not need to use the domain and secure arguments, which is why I omitted them  from the preceding examples, but if you do they are available.  Here’s an example that lets you test that cookies are being reliably transferred:     window.onload = function    {     value = ProcessCookie 'read', 'username'      if  value != false         alert "The value returned for 'username' is: '" + value + "'"      else alert "The cookie 'username' has no value."        alert "Click OK to store cookie 'username' with the value 'fred'"      ProcessCookie 'save', 'username', 'fred', 60 * 60 * 24        alert "Click OK to retrieve the cookie"      value = ProcessCookie 'read', 'username'        if  confirm "The value returned for 'username' is: '" + value     +        "'\n\nNow, either click [OK] to delete the cookie, and then\n" +        "reload the page to see if the cookie has been erased.\n\nOr " +        "click [Cancel] to do nothing, and then reload\nthe page to "  +        "see if it has retained its value.\n"          ProcessCookie 'erase', 'username'   }     This JavaScript first fetches the cookie ‘username’ and, if it has a value, it is displayed.  The first time you load this page, that cookie won’t exist so you’ll see an alert pop up and  tell you so.  Next, the cookie is created and assigned the value ‘fred’, with alert messages before and   after so you can see the result of each action.  Finally, a confirm dialog is called up in which you can click either the OK button to  erase the cookie or the Cancel button to leave it alone. I suggest you click OK and then  reload the page to see that the cookie has been erased. Then follow through the alerts again,  but this time click the Cancel button and reload the page, and you’ll see that the cookie’s  value has been retained.      326   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Plug-in function ProcessCookie action, name, value, seconds, path,      domain, secure   {     if  action == 'save'      {        var date = new Date          date.setTime date.getTime   + seconds * 1000           var expires     = seconds ?

'; secure='  + secure             : ''        document.cookie = name + '=' + escape value  + expires + path     }     else if  action == 'read'      {        if  !document.cookie.length  return false        else        {           var start = document.cookie.indexOf name + '='              if  start == -1  return false           else           {              start  += name.length + 1              var end = document.cookie.indexOf ';', start               end     =  end == -1  ? document.cookie.length : end                            return unescape document.cookie.substring start, end             }        }     }     else if  action == 'erase'         ProcessCookie 'save', name, '', -60   }    85  CreateAjaxObject   Ajax is the power behind the vastly improved user interaction of Web 2.0. It stands for  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which is really a contrived acronym for a background  call made to a web server. Using this plug-in, you can easily create a new Ajax object that  can be used to send and request information to and from a web server in the background,  without the user being aware of it.  Unlike in the past, when a POST or GET stopped action in the browser until it completed,   with Ajax the browser handles the request without disrupting the web application.  Figure 11-2 shows a simple HTML file that has been fetched from the web server and   inserted into a div, using this plug-in in conjunction with the next one, GetAjaxRequest  .      C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    327     Figure 11-2  The contents of   a web page has  been inserted   into a div.  About the Plug-in This plug-in creates an Ajax object ready for making background calls to the web server. It  requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object or object ID—this may not be an array  	 callback  The function to pass the returned data to once it has been retrieved  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  ajax  readyState  status  responseText  XMLHttpRequest    ActiveXObject    Local Ajax object Property of ajax containing its state Property of ajax containing its status Property of ajax containing the text returned by the Ajax call Function used by non-Microsoft browsers to create an Ajax object Function used by Microsoft browsers to create an Ajax object  How It Works Since the Ajax request object has to be created in different ways for different browsers, this  plug-in uses pairs of try{} ... catch{} statements to try each method in turn until one  works or until all have been tried and false is returned, like this:  try  {     var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest    }  catch e1   {     try       328   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        {        ajax = new ActiveXObject "Msxml2.XMLHTTP"      }     catch e2      {        try        {           ajax = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP"         }        catch e3         {           ajax = false        }     }  }  The first try   works with any browser but Internet Explorer version 6 or lower, the   second is for Internet Explorer 6, and the third is for Internet Explorer 5. Therefore, the tests  are made roughly in order of popular browser usage.  Assuming one of the try  functions succeeds, ajax is a new Ajax object; otherwise, it  contains the value false. If it isn’t an object, then the plug-in will return false; otherwise  the following code attaches an inline, anonymous function to the onreadystatechange  event of ajax, as follows:  if  ajax  ajax.onreadystatechange = function    {     if  this.readyState   == 4   &&         this.status       == 200 &&         this.responseText != null        callback.call this.responseText   }  This subfunction is called every time the readyState property of ajax changes and   checks whether it has a value of 4, the status property has a value of 200, and the  responseText property is not null. If all these tests are satisfied, it means an Ajax request  was successful, so the function passed in the callback argument is called, passing it the  data returned in this.responseText.  The actual Ajax call is not made by this plug-in. It merely catches the event ready to   populate id with the value that is returned by an Ajax call. The Ajax call itself is made in the  next two plug-ins, GetAjaxRequest   and PostAjaxRequest  .  How To Use It Generally, you will not use this function directly if you call either GetAjaxRequest   or  PostAjaxRequest   to handle your Ajax calls, because they will call it for you; as in the  following code, which loads some data into a div:           window.onload = function         C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    329  {     url = 'ajaxtest.htm'     GetAjaxRequest 'a', todiv, url        function todiv       {        Html 'a', this      }  }     The function todiv   is passed to the plug-in  note that parentheses have been omitted   from the function, otherwise only the value returned by it would be passed  and is later called  back by it when the returned data is ready. At that point, it retrieves the data using the this  keyword and assigns it to the innerHTML property of the div using the Html   plug-in.  You need to know that Ajax is a tightly controlled process to prevent hackers using it to   inject malevolent code from other servers. Therefore, only files or programs on the same  server as the one containing the Ajax can be accessed. For example, if you wanted to pull a  copy of the Google home page into a div on your website, it would not be possible and the  Ajax call would fail.  Therefore, the preceding example will not work if you test it on another server unless   you also copy the ajaxtest.htm file to it. However, you can verify that it works by calling the  script up from the Plug-in JavaScript website, using this URL:  http:  pluginjavascript.com plug-ins example85.htm  The Plug-in function CreateAjaxObject id, callback   {     try     {        var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest       }     catch e1      {        try        {           ajax = new ActiveXObject "Msxml2.XMLHTTP"         }        catch e2         {           try           {              ajax = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP"            }           catch e3            {              ajax = false           }        }     }         330   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        if  ajax  ajax.onreadystatechange = function       {        if  this.readyState   == 4   &&            this.status       == 200 &&            this.responseText != null           callback.call this.responseText      }       return ajax  }    86  GetAjaxRequest   This plug-in uses the previous one, CreateAjaxObject  , to load the Wikipedia home  page into a div. Of course, Ajax can be used for much more than grabbing web pages, such  as checking whether a username is taken when signing up to a website or updating news  feeds, reader comments, or chat, and so on. However, I decided to pull in a web page for the  sake of simplicity, so that you can quickly verify that these plug-ins are working for you, as  shown in Figure 11-3.  About the Plug-in This plug-in fetches data from a website in the background. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object or object ID—this cannot be an array  	 callback  The function to pass the returned data to once it has been retrieved  	 url  The URL with which to communicate  	 args  Any arguments to pass to the URL  Figure 11-3    The Wikipedia  home page has  been inserted   into a div.      C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    331  Variables, Arrays, and Functions nocache  CreateAjaxObject    ajax  open    send    Math.random    Local variable assigned a random string to prevent caching Local variable assigned an Ajax object Plug-in to return a new Ajax object Method of ajax for opening a request Method of ajax for sending a request Function to return a random number  How It Works This plug-in uses the GET method to communicate with a server, which passes data in the  tail of the URL called a query string. However, browser caching will often interfere with  repeated requests of this type, serving up only the cached data from previous requests.  Therefore, the variable nocache is created and assigned a random string to ensure that no  two GET calls will be the same and therefore will not be cached:  var nocache = '&nocache=' + Math.random   * 1000000  Next, the variable ajax is assigned the new Ajax object returned by calling   CreateAjaxObject  , and if the result is not true  meaning the call was unsuccessful  a  value of false is returned:  var ajax = new CreateAjaxObject id   if  !ajax  return false  If execution reaches this point, the Ajax object was successfully created, so the open   method of ajax is called, passing it the string ‘GET’ for the type of request. This is followed  by a string comprising the URL to be called that was passed in url, the arguments supplied  in args, the nocache string just created, and the value true to tell the browser to make an  asynchronous call  a value of false would tell it to make a synchronous call :  ajax.open 'GET', url + '?' + args + nocache, true   Finally, the call is made and the value true is returned to indicate success:  ajax.send null   return true  How To Use It To use this plug-in, decide what data you wish to load and from where, then call the plug-in,   passing it a function to call back when the data has been retrieved and any arguments that  require passing.  The following example is somewhat interesting in that it gets around the problem of   being unable to access websites other than the one the Ajax web page came from by calling  a PHP script on the server, which then fetches the requested data without a hitch:           window.onload = function         332   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     {     url  = 'http:  pluginjavascript.com plug-ins ajaxget.php'     args = 'url=http:  wikipedia.org '     GetAjaxRequest 'a', todiv, url, args        function todiv       {        Html 'a', this      }  }     The ajaxget.php program is a very simple, one-liner that looks like this:     If your server supports PHP  and most do , you can use the same script on it to check  whether the server has been sent a query string looking something like url=http:  website. com?args=vals.  In the case of the preceding example, the args=vals section is specified in the  line that assigns the string url=http:  wikipedia.org to the args variable .  The ajaxget.php script then uses the file_get_contents   PHP function to fetch the   requested data  in this case the Wikipedia home page , which is then returned using the  PHP echo command, which outputs the data it just fetched.  The todiv   callback function, which was passed to GetAjaxRequest  , is then called   back and passed the retrieved data, which it then promptly inserts into the innerHTML  property of the div.  As with the previous Ajax example, the restrictions put in place by browsers require that  the example and PHP files reside on the same server, so here’s a link you can try it out with:  http:  www.pluginjavascript.com plug-ins example86.htm  The Plug-in function GetAjaxRequest id, type, url, args   {     var nocache = '&nocache=' + Math.random   * 1000000     var ajax    = new CreateAjaxObject id, type      if  !ajax  return false       ajax.open 'GET', url + '?' + args + nocache, true      ajax.send null      return true  }    87  PostAjaxRequest   This plug-in is very similar to GetAjaxRequest   except that it uses a POST request to  interact with the web server. In Figure 11-4, the weather at the airport in Anchorage, Alaska,  has been extracted from the weather.gov RSS feed. Here it is displayed in raw form, but you  can easily write some JavaScript to use only the items of data you want and format them to  your requirements.      C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    333     Figure 11-4  With this plug-in  you can extract  data from an   RSS feed into   a code tag.  About the Plug-in This plug-in fetches data from a website in the background. It requires the following  arguments:   	 id  An object or object ID—this cannot be an array  	 callback  The function to pass the returned data to once it has been retrieved  	 url  The URL with which to communicate  	 args  Any arguments to pass to the URL  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  contenttype  CreateAjaxObject    setRequestHeader    ajax  open    send    Math.random    Local variable containing the content type used for   URL-encoded forms Local variable assigned an Ajax object Plug-in to return a new Ajax object Method of ajax for opening a request Method of ajax for setting various headers Method of ajax for sending a request Function to return a random number  How It Works This plug-in is as simple as GetAjaxRequest  . It starts by setting the content type of the  date in the request being sent to that of a URL-encoded form. It then creates the Ajax object  with a call to CreateAjaxObject  , and if the result is not true, returns the value false  as it cannot proceed any further:  var contenttype = 'application x-www-form-urlencoded'  var ajax        = new CreateAjaxObject id, callback   if  !ajax  return false      334   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     If the object creation was successful, it goes on to open up the request, passing a type of   ‘POST’ in POST, the URL in URL, and the value true, for an asynchronous request:  ajax.open 'POST', url, true   Next, the content type, content length, and connection headers are sent:  ajax.setRequestHeader 'Content-type',   contenttype   ajax.setRequestHeader 'Content-length', args.length   ajax.setRequestHeader 'Connection',     'close'   Finally, the request is sent and the value true is returned to indicate success:  ajax.send args   return true  How To Use It You call this plug-in in exactly the same way as GetAjaxRequest  —it’s just that the process  used by the plug-in to perform the Ajax is a POST, not a GET request. Therefore, the target  of the request also needs to respond to the POST request, as is the case with the following  example, which fetches the weather details at Anchorage, Alaska airport:           window.onload = function    {     url  = 'ajaxpost.php'     args = 'url=http:  www.weather.gov xml current_obs PANC.rss'     PostAjaxRequest 'a', todiv, url, args        function todiv       {        var rss = this.replace  \< g, '&lt;'         rss     =  rss.replace  \> g, '&gt;'         rss     =  rss.replace  \n g, ' '         Html 'a', rss      }  }     The URL supplied to the plug-in is the PHP script ajaxpost.php, which is in the same  folder as the example file. It’s another simple one-line PHP script, which looks like this:     This is almost the same as the ajaxget.php script except that it processes POST requests.   You can copy it to your own server, where it should work fine if it supports PHP.  This example is a little more interesting than the previous two in that an RSS feed is   fetched. It’s no different than a web page as far as Ajax is concerned, but displaying it after       C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    335  it has been retrieved poses a problem, in that it contains several XML tags that won’t show  up under HTML.  To correct this, the callback function todiv   has been modified to exchange all   occurrences of the   symbols with their HTML entity equivalents &lt; and &gt; and  all linefeed characters are changed to   tags.  For reasons previously stated, the PHP and example should be in the same folder of the   same server, so here’s a URL you can use to test the example:  http:  www.pluginjavascript.com plug-ins example87.htm  Note  With XML, you would probably want to parse the tree to extract just the elements you want,   but if you are fetching only text or HTML, you have all the tools you need to easily make all  types of Ajax calls and act appropriately on the data they return.  The Plug-in function PostAjaxRequest id, callback, url, args   {     var contenttype = 'application x-www-form-urlencoded'     var ajax        = new CreateAjaxObject id, callback      if  !ajax  return false       ajax.open 'POST', url, true      ajax.setRequestHeader 'Content-type',   contenttype      ajax.setRequestHeader 'Content-length', args.length      ajax.setRequestHeader 'Connection',     'close'      ajax.send args      return true  }    88  FrameBust   This is a simple but always useful plug-in that checks whether it is running inside a frame  and, if it is, busts out of it, placing the current page in its own parent page. This can be  useful when you find that other sites link to your pages, but bury them inside iframes so  that they do not display at their best. Figure 11-5 shows one web page embedded within  another and displaying an optional confirm dialog, offering to bust out of the frame.  About the Plug-in This plug-in can close any embedding frame, making a web page the parent web page for  the current tab or window. It supports the following optional argument:   	 message   If this has a value, it will be displayed in a confirm dialog window   offering the user the option to click OK to close the surrounding frame. If it doesn’t  have a value, the plug-in will automatically and silently close the embedding frame.      336   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 11-5  With this plug-in  you can bust your  web pages out of  embedding frames.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  top  self  top.location  self.location.href  confirm    Object representing the outermost of any frame set Object representing the current document Property of top containing URL of its document Property of self.location containing its URL Function to offer a yes no confirm dialog  How It Works This plug-in either makes the current document the top one by setting its URL to that of the  top object’s, or it displays a message  if the message argument has a value  that offers the  user the choice of breaking out of frames or leaving them as they are.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, either call it without an argument if you never want your pages to be  embedded in frames, or pass a message for a confirm dialog, to which the response is to  click OK to bust out of frames or Cancel to keep the pages as they are. Here’s an example of  passing a message:     FrameBust "This page has been loaded up within a surrounding frame.\n" +     "Please click [OK] if you would like to close the surrounding frame."      You can use \n or other escaped characters in the message to control the way it displays. If you don’t wish to provide a message and want all pages to bust out of frames, just   leave the message string out of the call to FrameBust  .      C h a p t e r   1 1 :   C o o k i e s ,  aj a x ,   a n d   S e c u r i t y    337  The Plug-in function FrameBust message   {     if  top != self      {        if  message         {           if  confirm message                top.location.replace self.location.href         }        else top.location.replace self.location.href      }  }    89  ProtectEmail   Spamming these days is worse than ever now that the spammers have access to huge  botnets of hacked computers and use automated programs to continuously trawl the web  looking for e-mail addresses to harvest. However, e-mail is still extremely important and  you usually need to display your e-mail address prominently on your site.  Thankfully, with this plug-in you can display your e-mail address in such a way that   your users can click or copy it, yet it will be obfuscated from automatic e-mail harvesters, as  shown in Figure 11-6, where the e-mail address is both copyable and clickable but doesn’t  actually appear as a whole in the web page.  About the Plug-in This plug-in obfuscates an e-mail address in such a way that spam harvesting programs  should not be able to find it. It requires as many arguments as you like because you break  your e-mail address into multiple strings and then pass them all as parameters.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  a  arguments  Local variable used to iterate through the arguments array Local variable containing the e-mail address to display Array containing all the arguments passed to a function     Figure 11-6  Use this plug-in to  keep your e-mail  address visible but  unharvestable.      338   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s  How It Works This is a simple function that relies on the fact that all arguments sent to a function can be  accessed via the arguments array. What it does is piece all the arguments it is sent back  together to reconstruct an e-mail address using a for   loop, like this:  var a = ''  for  var j=0 ; j < arguments.length ; ++j      a += arguments[j]  The variable a is then used to create a hyperlink to the e-mail address, with the code  itself using segmented strings to further obfuscate matters. The result is then returned,   like this:  return " " + a + " "   How To Use It To use this plug-in, break your e-mail address up into multiple strings and then pass them  all to the plug-in. Here’s an example showing how to do this for the e-mail address simon. jones@myserver.com.   Please contact me at:   .        window.onload = function    {     Html 'email', ProtectEmail 'sim', 'on.j', 'ones',        '@myserv', 'er.c', 'om'    }     Where you wish the e-mail address to be shown, just place an empty span and give it an   ID. You can then insert the e-mail address into the innerHTML property of the span from  within a section of JavaScript. If you ensure that the e-mail address is completely broken  into parts, it is doubtful that any known automatic harvester will be able to extract it for  spamming purposes.  The Plug-in function ProtectEmail    {     var a = ''       for  var j=0 ; j < arguments.length ; ++j         a += arguments[j]       return " " + a + " "  }   Chapter 12  Forms and Validation      340   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Form validation is something you must do on your web server to ensure that you   receive the data that is required and remove any attempts at hacking or compromising  your server or the data on it. However, it is very helpful to your users if you also   provide validation directly in the browser.  For example, it can be particularly helpful to provide extra assistance when a user is   filling in a form to save it from having to be represented to them if it fails validation at the  server. It also cuts down on your bandwidth usage and keeps the optimum number of  concurrent users on the server.  This chapter includes plug-ins to provide extra hints for blank form fields that must be   filled out, to provide the ability to resize text area inputs if a user types more than the  expected amount of text, to check that e-mail addresses and passwords are valid, to clean  up user input strings, and to check that credit card number checksums validate.     90  FieldPrompt   When a form field hasn’t been entered, there’s a large blank area of white space that isn’t  being used. With this plug-in you can display a prompt in the field that disappears as   soon as the user starts typing into it. Figure 12-1 shows two empty input fields containing  prompts that were created using this plug-in, in a similar way to the new HTML5 placeholder  feature.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a form input object and, if it is blank, displays a prompt of your choosing.  It requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object or object ID—this cannot be an array  	 prompt  The prompt string to display  	 inputcolor  The color to use for displaying user input  	 promptcolor  The color in which to display the font  	 promptstyle  The font style to use for the prompt, such as ‘italic’     Figure 12-1  This plug-in  provides additional  information to your  users.      C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    341  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  FP_Empty  value  fontStyle  color  FP_Off    FP_On    Property of id that is true when the input field doesn’t contain any  input, otherwise false Property of id containing its contents Style property of id containing the font style of the field Style property of id containing the color of the field text Subfunction called when the user moves the cursor into the field Subfunction called when the user moves out of a field  How It Works This plug-in starts by giving the input and prompt colors and styles default values if none  have been passed to it, like this:  inputcolor  = inputcolor  ? inputcolor  : '000000'  promptcolor = promptcolor ? promptcolor : '888888'  promptstyle = promptstyle ? promptstyle : 'italic'  Next, the FP_On   subfunction is called to display the supplied prompt if the field is  empty, and the onfocus and onblur events of id are attached to the FP_Off   and FP_ On   subfunctions so that the prompt can be switched in and out according to whether the  user has clicked within the field or outside of it:  The FP_Off   Subfunction This function is called when the field gains focus. It first checks the value property of id to  see whether it contains the prompt string. If it does, then the prompt needs to be removed  ready for the user to type in some input, like this:  FP_On    O id .onfocus = FP_Off  O id .onblur  = FP_On  O id .FP_Empty  = true  O id .value     = ''  S id .fontStyle = ''  S id .color     = inputcolor  Here, the FP_Empty property of id is set to true to indicate that the field is empty, the  field’s value is set to the empty string, any font style is turned off, and the field text color  is set to the value in the inputcolor argument:  If the field doesn’t contain the value in prompt, then the FP_Empty property is set    to false.  The FP_On   Subfunction This function displays the value in prompt as long as the field doesn’t already have a value  entered by the user, which it checks by examining the value property of id. It also allows  the code within to be executed if the field contains the prompt string. The reason for this is       342   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     that if the user reloads the page while a prompt is displayed, the value property will already  be set to the prompt before this function runs. This is the code that inserts the prompt:  O id .FP_Empty  = true  O id .value     = prompt  S id .fontStyle = promptstyle  S id .color     = promptcolor  Here the FP_Empty property is first set to true to indicate that there isn’t any user   entered text in the field, value is assigned the string in prompt, and the fontStyle and  color properties of the prompt are set.  However, if the value property does contain text entered by the user, the FP_Empty   property of id is set to false to indicate this.    How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it a form field object, a prompt string, and optional color and style  arguments. Here’s an example that creates two fields, both displaying different prompts:   Signup Form      Name:     Email:            window.onload = function    {     FieldPrompt 'name', "Please enter your name",        '000000', '444444', 'italic'      FieldPrompt 'email', "Please enter your email address",        '000000', '444444', 'italic'   }     The two calls to FieldPrompt   can also use the plug-in’s default values, like this:  FieldPrompt 'name', "Please enter your name"   FieldPrompt 'email', "Please enter your email address"   The Plug-in function FieldPrompt id, prompt, inputcolor, promptcolor, promptstyle   {     inputcolor  = inputcolor  ? inputcolor  : '000000'     promptcolor = promptcolor ? promptcolor : '888888'     promptstyle = promptstyle ? promptstyle : 'italic'        FP_On         O id .onfocus = FP_Off     O id .onblur  = FP_On         C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    343     function FP_Off       {        if  O id .value == prompt         {           O id .FP_Empty  = true           O id .value     = ''           S id .fontStyle = ''           S id .color     = inputcolor        }        else O id .FP_Empty = false     }       function FP_On       {        if  O id .value == ''  O id .value == prompt         {           O id .FP_Empty  = true           O id .value     = prompt           S id .fontStyle = promptstyle           S id .color     = promptcolor        }        else O id .FP_Empty = false     }  }    91  ResizeTextarea   When you offer a textarea field in a form in which users can enter more than a single line of  input, it can be difficult to decide how large to make it. If it is too small, users will have to  scroll back and forth through it when making revisions. On the other hand, if it is too large,  it wastes space and can look intimidating, implying that a large amount of text is expected  to be input.  This plug-in provides the solution by allowing you to specify minimum and maximum  vertical heights within which the textarea is allowed to expand or contract, according to the  amount of text entered. In Figure 12-2, a 64 by 3 column textarea is displayed, in which  some text is being entered.  Then, in Figure 12-3, a total of 8 lines of text have been input, and the textarea has   expanded accordingly.  About the Plug-in This plug-in adjusts the height of a textarea field according to the amount of text it contains,  within bounds that you specify. It requires the following arguments:   	 id  An object or object ID or an array of objects and or object IDs  	 min  Optional argument specifying the minimum height that id can be reduced to  	 max  Optional argument specifying the maximum height that id can be enlarged to      344   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 12-2  Some text is being  entered into a  textarea form field.     Figure 12-3  After several more  lines are entered,  the textarea  expands  accordingly.  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  onmouseup  onkeyup  scrollHeight  clientHeight  rows  DoResizeTextarea    Local variable for iterating through id if it is an array Event of id that calls the subfunction after a mouse click Event of id that calls the subfunction after a key press Property of id containing its total height in pixels Property of id containing its visible height pixels Property of id containing its number of rows Subfunction to resize the height of id      C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    345  How It Works This plug-in starts by calling itself recursively if id is an array, passing each element to be  processed individually, like this:  if  id instanceof Array   {     for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j         ResizeTextarea id[j], min, max      return  }  100 lines, respectively:  min = min ? min : 0  max = max ? max : 100  the DoResizeTextarea   subfunction:  O id .onmouseup = DoResizeTextarea  O id .onkeyup   = DoResizeTextarea  Next, if min or max have not been passed values, they are assigned defaults of 0 and    Finally, in the setup section, the onmouseup and onkeyup events of id are assigned to   The DoResizeTextarea   Subfunction This function contains just two while   loops. The first one continuously increases the  number of rows that id has until either the text in the textarea is fully visible, or the  maximum number of rows in the argument max is reached:  while  O id .scrollHeight > O id .clientHeight && O id .rows < max      ++O id .rows  The second while   loop performs the inverse, reducing the height of the textarea so   that it is only as large as the text it contains or until it reaches the minimum height supplied  in the argument min:  while  O id .scrollHeight   min      --O id .rows  Note  While automatically expanding and reducing the textarea seems to work fine on most major   browsers, once the clientHeight property in Firefox has been increased it doesn’t seem to  reduce it back down again if text is deleted, so the textarea will net shrink. If you can think of a  way to get Firefox to reduce as well as increase a textarea according to the text within it, please  let me know via the website.      346   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How To Use It To use this plug-in, prepare the textarea by setting it to the width and height you need, then  pass it to the plug-in, along with an optional minimum and maximum height. This example  shows how:   Please enter a short bio            window.onload = function    {     ResizeTextarea 'ta', 3, 8   }     In this example, a minimum height of 3 and a maximum height of 8 rows have been  passed. However, you can omit one or both of these arguments, in which case minimum  and maximum values of 0 and 10 will be used.  The Plug-in function ResizeTextarea id, min, max   {     if  id instanceof Array      {        for  var j = 0 ; j < id.length ; ++j            ResizeTextarea id[j], min, max         return     }       min = min ? min : 0     max = max ? max : 10       O id .onmouseup = DoResizeTextarea     O id .onkeyup   = DoResizeTextarea       function DoResizeTextarea       {        while  O id .scrollHeight > O id .clientHeight && O id .rows < max            ++O id .rows          while  O id .scrollHeight   min            --O id .rows     }  }    92  ValidateEmail   With this plug-in, you can make a quick test on a supplied e-mail address to determine  whether it is legally structured. This lets you filter out typos, as well as people simply  entering nonsense to see what will happen. Figure 12-4 shows the result of testing the  fictitious e-mail address bill@gates.com, which validates since it is correctly formed.      C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    347     Figure 12-4  This plug-in tests  whether an e-mail  address validates.  About the Plug-in This plug-in checks whether an e-mail address is correctly structured and in a valid format.  It requires the following argument:   	 email  A string containing the e-mail address to validate  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  at  left  right  llen  rlen  test    indexOf    Local variable containing the position of the @ sign in email Local variable containing the part of email before the @ Local variable containing the part of email after the @ Local variable containing the length of left Local variable containing the length of right Function to test for a match in a string Function to locate the first occurrence of one string in another  How It Works This function tests various aspects of a supplied string to check whether it conforms to the  correct standards for an e-mail address. It starts off by seeing if there is an @ symbol in the  string, using a call to indexOf  :  var at = email.indexOf '@'   Then, if there is no @ or the argument contains characters that are not word characters    a–z, A–Z, or 0–9 , hyphens, periods, or the  @, underline, or plus symbols, the plug-in returns  false, as it has already been determined that the e-mail address is invalid, as follows:  if  at == -1   [^\w\-\.\@\_\+] .test email   return false  Next, the variables left and right are assigned the string on either side of the @ symbol,   and the variables llen and rlen are then set to the lengths of each, like this:  var left  = email.substr 0, at   var right = email.substr at + 1   var llen  = left.length  var rlen  = right.length      348   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Using these values, if left is less than 1 or greater than 64 characters, or right is less  than 4 or greater than 254 characters, or if there is no period after the @ symbol, then e-mail  address is invalid, and so the plug-in returns false:  if  llen   64  rlen   254      right.indexOf '.'  == -1  return false  After all these tests, the format of the e-mail address appears to be valid, so the value   true is returned:     return true  Note  A valid e-mail address should be of the form 1–64 characters@4–254 characters. It can   contain the letters a–z or A–Z, the digits 0–9, and the hyphen, period, underline and plus  characters. No other characters are recommended, even though some may seem to be supported,  as they could conflict with shell scripts or other programs used to process emails. If you need to  support other characters place them into the regular expression passed to the test   function in  the second line of the plug-in. Also there should always be a period after the @ symbol to divide  the domain name from the top level domain extension.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it a string containing an e-mail address, and it will return either  true or false, depending on whether the e-mail address is valid. Here’s an example that  will let you test the plug-in by entering different e-mail addresses:  Email:     Submit        window.onload = function    {     O 'button' .onclick = function       {        if  ValidateEmail O 'email' .value   alert "That address is valid"         else alert "That email address is invalid"      }  }     The HTML section creates an input field and then places a button after it. The     section then attaches an anonymous, inline function to the button via its onclick event,  which validates the e-mail address each time it is clicked.  The Plug-in function ValidateEmail email   {     var at = email.indexOf '@'          C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    349     if  at == -1   [^\w\-\.\@\_\+] .test email   return false       var left  = email.substr 0, at      var right = email.substr at + 1      var llen  = left.length     var rlen  = right.length       if  llen   64  rlen   254         right.indexOf '.'  == -1  return false       return true  }    93  ValidatePassword   To help your users pick more secure passwords, you may wish to require them to be of a  certain format, such as including both upper- and lowercase characters, as well as digits   and punctuation. With this plug-in, you can choose any or all of these and the plug-in will  return true or false, depending on whether the user has satisfied your requirements.   In Figure 12-5 the password that has been entered has not verified.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a password string and then returns either true or false, depending on  whether it satisfies the conditions also passed as arguments. It requires the following  arguments:   	 pass  The password to validate  	 min  The minimum password length  	 max  The maximum password length  	 upper   	 lower   	 dig   	 punct   If true or 1, at least one uppercase character must be in pass If true or 1, at least one lowercase character must be in pass  If true or 1, at least one digit must be in pass  If true or 1, at least one nonalphanumeric character must be in pass     Figure 12-5  Ensure your users  enter strong  passwords with  this plug-in.      350   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  len  valid  test    Local variable containing the length of pass local variable that is true if pass validates, otherwise false Function to test for a match in a string  How It Works This plug-in first assigns the length of the password to len and initializes valid with the  value true, which it will retain if it passes the tests to determine its validity:  var len   = pass.length  var valid = true  Next, pass is checked to ensure it is within the lengths required by the min and max   arguments, and valid is assigned the value false if not:  if  len   max  valid = false  The following four tests are made only if the argument they work from is true or has  the value 1. For example, the following statement returns false if the argument upper is  true or 1 and there is not at least one uppercase letter in pass:  else if  upper && ! [A-Z] .test pass   valid = false  The following three statements do the same for lowercase letters, digits, and   punctuation  nonalphanumeric  characters:  else if  lower  && ! [a-z] .test pass          valid = false  else if  dig    && ! [0-9] .test pass          valid = false  else if  punct  && ! [^a-zA-Z0-9] .test pass   valid = false  If pass meets all these tests, then valid will retain its initial value of true, which is  then returned; otherwise, one of the tests will set valid to false, and that value will be  returned:  return valid  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it a password string and the arguments you want for the password  to meet your security requirements. The following example uses the strictest policy the plug-in  supports, in which the password must include at least one each of upper- and lowercase  letters, digits, and punctuation. It also requires passwords to be at least 8 characters long   but no more than 16 :  Password:     Submit             C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    351  window.onload = function    {     O 'button' .onclick = function       {        if  ValidatePassword O 'pass' .value, 8, 16, 1, 1, 1, 1             alert "That password is valid"         else alert "That password is invalid"      }  }      The Plug-in function ValidatePassword pass, min, max, upper, lower, dig, punct   {     var len   = pass.length     var valid = true          if       len   max                valid = false     else if  upper  && ! [A-Z] .test pass          valid = false     else if  lower  && ! [a-z] .test pass          valid = false     else if  dig    && ! [0-9] .test pass          valid = false     else if  punct  && ! [^a-zA-Z0-9] .test pass   valid = false       return valid  }    94  CleanupString   This plug-in provides a number of string manipulation functions that often come in handy.  For example, don’t you hate it when you enter a credit card or phone number into a web  form, only to be told you aren’t allowed to use spaces and must enter it again? If your  content management system doesn’t like spaces either, this plug-in can remove them before  they arrive at your server. It can also remove all digits, text, or punctuation, convert from  lower- to uppercase text  and vice versa , and even change all groups of multiple spaces  into just a single space. Figure 12-6 shows a credit card number being entered into a web  form including spaces.     Figure 12-6  A user has entered  a sequence of  credit card  numbers with  spaces.      352   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Figure 12-7 shows the input after the user has clicked the Submit button—all the spaces   are now removed, leaving only the card number behind.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a string and can perform one or more of several actions on it. It requires  the following arguments:  If true or 1, all spaces in string are removed  If true or 1, all digits in string are removed If true or 1, all text in string is removed If true or 1, all punctuation in string is removed If true or 1, all uppercase characters in string are converted to   If true or 1, all lowercase characters in string are converted to    	 string  The string to clean up  	 allspaces   	 alldigs   	 alltext   	 allpunct   	 uptolow  lowercase  	 lowtoup  uppercase   	 spacestosingle   reduced to a single space  If true or 1, all  groups of multiple spaces in string are   Variables, Arrays, and Functions  replace    Function to replace one value with another in a string  How It Works This plug-in goes through each of the arguments it is supplied in turn. If the argument has  the value true or 1, then the matching replace   function is performed on the string. For  example, the following statement removes all spaces from string when the allspaces  argument is 1 or true:  if  allspaces  string = string.replace  [\s] g, ''   All the remaining statements are very similar, differing only by the regular expressions   used for testing.     Figure 12-7  This plug-in has  automatically  stripped out the  spaces.      C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    353  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it a string along with the arguments needed to perform the changes  required on the string. The modified string will then be returned. Here’s an example that  cleans up a credit card number by removing all spaces, text, and punctuation from it:  Credit Card Number:      Submit        window.onload = function    {     O 'button' .onclick = function       {        O 'ccnum' .value =           CleanupString O 'ccnum' .value , 1 ,0 ,1, 1, 0, 0, 0      }  }     To use this in a web form, you could change the onclick event used in this example to  the onsubmit event of your form. If you do, make sure that when the plug-in has finished  execution, the function you point the event to returns true, because any other value will  likely cancel the form submission, and a return value of false certainly will cancel it.  The Plug-in function CleanupString string, allspaces, alldigs, alltext, allpunct,     uptolow, lowtoup, spacestosingle   {     if  allspaces       string = string.replace  [\s] g, ''      if  alldigs         string = string.replace  [\d] g, ''      if  alltext         string = string.replace  [a-zA-Z] g, ''      if  allpunct        string = string.replace  [^\sa-zA-Z0-9] g, ''      if  uptolow         string = string.toLowerCase       if  lowtoup         string = string.toUpperCase       if  spacestosingle  string = string.replace  [\s] g, ' '        return string  }    95  ValidateCreditCard   With this plug-in, you can check that a credit card number you are given by a user is at least  of the correct format and has the right checksum before submitting it to a card processing  company. Figure 12-8 shows a set of made up credit card details that did not pass the  validation.       354   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 12-8  Checking whether  credit card details  match basic  requirements   About the Plug-in This plug-in takes details about a credit card and returns true or false depending whether  the card passes checksum and date verification. It requires the following arguments:   	 number  A credit card number  	 month  The card’s expiry month  	 year  The card’s expiry year  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  left  cclen  chksum  date  substr    getTime    getFullYear    getMonth    Local variable containing the first 4 digits of number Local variable containing the number of digits in number Local variable containing the card’s checksum Local date object Function to return a portion of a string Function to get the current time and date Function to get the year as a 4-digit number Function to get the month  How It Works This function first ensures that all three parameters passed to it are strings by adding the  empty string to them, like this:  number += ''  month  += ''  year   += ''      C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    355  Next, each argument is processed through the CleanupString   plug-in to ensure that   they are in the formats required:  number = CleanupString number, true, false, true, true   month  = CleanupString month,  true, false, true, true   year   = CleanupString year,   true, false, true, true   After this, the variable left is assigned the first 4 digits of number, cclen is set to the   card number’s length, and chksum is initialized to 0:  var left    = number.substr 0, 4   var cclen   = number.length  var chksum  = 0  Next, several if   ... else if   statements check that left contains a valid   sequence that matches a known brand of credit card and, if it does, that the card number  length in cclen is correct for the card type. If left doesn’t match a known card, or it  matches one but cclen is the wrong length, then the plug-in returns false to indicate that  the card didn’t verify.  If these initial tests are passed, the card’s checksum is then calculated using an algorithm  invented by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn  for further details see en.wikipedia.org wiki Luhn_ algorithm , like this:  for  var j = 1 -  cclen % 2  ; j < cclen ; j += 2      if  j < cclen  chksum += number[j] * 1    for  j = cclen % 2 ; j < cclen ; j += 2   {     if  j < cclen      {        d = number[j] * 2        chksum += d < 10 ? d : d - 9     }  }    if  chksum % 10 != 0  return false  Finally, the date is looked up and compared to the values supplied to the plug-in, so that   even if the card has validated this far, the plug-in will still return false if the card has expired:  var date = new Date    date.setTime date.getTime     if  year.length == 4  year = year.substr 2, 2           if  year > 50                                 return false     else if  year  <  date.getFullYear   - 2000   return false     else if   date.getMonth   + 1  > month        return false     else                                          return true      356   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it a card number, expiry date, and month and it will return true or  false. Of course, this algorithm tests only whether the card meets certain requirements and  not whether the user has entered a genuine card or whether the card has been revoked or is  over the user’s credit limit, and so on. The purpose of the plug-in is mainly to catch typing  errors and people entering random data to see what happens.  This example shows how you might use the plug-in:   Your credit card details:      Card Number:     Expires: Month    Year      Submit Credit Card        window.onload = function    {     O 'button' .onclick = function       {        if  ValidateCreditCard O 'ccnum' .value,           O 'ccmonth' .value, O 'ccyear' .value                alert "That card validated successfully"         else alert "That card did not validate"      }  }     When incorporating the plug-in with your own code you will probably want to replace   the onclick event attachment used in the example with a function attached to the  onsubmit event of your form. Also, make sure that when you do this your function returns  true if the card verifies to allow the form submission to complete, and false  along with  probably displaying an error message  if the card doesn’t validate, to stop the form  submission going through.  Note  Only years up to 2050 are currently supported in order to base card dates around the years   1950 to 2050. If you are reading a well thumbed copy of this book and it’s coming up to mid  century, and JavaScript is still being used, well, you may wish to increase the value 50 in the 4th  to last line to a higher value a few years ahead of the current year.  The Plug-in function ValidateCreditCard number, month, year   {     number     += ''     month      += ''     year       += ''     number      = CleanupString number, true, false, true, true      month       = CleanupString month,  true, false, true, true        C h a p t e r   1 2 :   F o r m s   a n d   V a l i d a t i o n    357     year        = CleanupString year,   true, false, true, true      var left    = number.substr 0, 4      var cclen   = number.length     var chksum  = 0          if  left >= 3000 && left <= 3059          left >= 3600 && left <= 3699          left >= 3800 && left <= 3889      {    Diners Club        if  cclen != 14  return false     }     else if  left >= 3088 && left <= 3094          left >= 3096 && left <= 3102          left >= 3112 && left <= 3120          left >= 3158 && left <= 3159          left >= 3337 && left <= 3349          left >= 3528 && left <= 3589      {    JCB        if  cclen != 16  return false     }     else if  left >= 3400 && left <= 3499          left >= 3700 && left <= 3799      {    American Express        if  cclen != 15  return false     }     else if  left >= 3890 && left <= 3899      {    Carte Blanche        if  cclen != 14  return false     }     else if  left >= 4000 && left <= 4999      {    Visa        if  cclen != 13 && cclen != 16  return false     }     else if  left >= 5100 && left <= 5599      {    MasterCard        if  cclen != 16  return false     }     else if  left == 5610      {    Australian BankCard        if  cclen != 16  return false     }     else if  left == 6011      {    Discover        if  cclen != 16  return false     }     else return false    Unrecognized Card       for  var j = 1 -  cclen % 2  ; j < cclen ; j += 2         if  j < cclen  chksum += number[j] * 1       for  j = cclen % 2 ; j < cclen ; j += 2      {       358   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        if  j < cclen         {           d = number[j] * 2           chksum += d < 10 ? d : d - 9        }     }       if  chksum % 10 != 0  return false       var date = new Date       date.setTime date.getTime          if  year.length == 4  year = year.substr 2, 2           if  year > 50                                 return false     else if  year  <  date.getFullYear   - 2000   return false     else if   date.getMonth   + 1  > month        return false     else                                          return true  }   Chapter 13  Solutions to Common problems      360   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     There are a number of plug-ins that didn’t fit clearly within any of the previous   chapters, so I’ve included them here. They offer features such as keeping your  copyright notices current each new year; a less intrusive, in-browser alert window   that doesn’t prevent you from accessing the rest of the current document; a function to  provide tooltips for any object; the facility to add cursor trails to the mouse pointer; and a  way to make a web page touch enabled for use with tablet computers and other touch  devices.    96  RollingCopyright   This simple plug-in is worth using on any pages where a copyright notice is included,  because no matter how many years ago you last updated the page, it will always show the  current year, as shown by the screen grab in Figure 13-1.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a start year for when the copyright began and returns a copyright string  using that and the current year. It requires the following argument:   	 start  The start year as a four-digit number  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  date  Date    getFullYear    Local date object Function to return a new date object Function to return a four digit year  How It Works This plug-in creates a new date object and assigns it the current year as a four-digit number,  like this:  var date = new Date    date     = date.getFullYear       Figure 13-1  Keep your  copyright notices  up-to-date with this  plug-in.      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    361  Then the two dates are returned preceded by a copyright symbol:  return '&copy; ' + start + "-" + date  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it the starting year for the copyright and then assign the string it  returns to an element in your document, as in the following example:           window.onload = function    {     Html 'copy', InsVars "This website is 1 MyWebProperties Inc",        RollingCopyright 2005     }     The HTML section creates a span that will be used to display the copyright message,   and then the   section uses the InsVars   plug-in to insert the result of calling  RollingCopyright   into a sentence, which is then assigned to the innerHTML property of  the span.  The Plug-in function RollingCopyright start   {     var date = new Date       date     = date.getFullYear         return '&copy; ' + start + "-" + date  }    97  Alert   The built-in JavaScript alert   function is great for help with debugging or for alerting  users about something important. However, the function is a modal dialog, which means  that it takes over the browser, preventing access to anything within it other than the alert  window. What’s worse, if a web page calls alert   in a loop it will effectively lock you out  of the browser, even preventing you from closing it.  This plug-in provides a handy replacement for the function that is much more user   friendly in that it is not modal, and all other parts of the browser remain accessible while it       362   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 13-2  A standard Internet  Explorer alert  message  is displayed. It also features smart scrolling; unlike the regular alert   window that just  gets bigger and bigger depending on the size of message, this plug-in will provide  scrollbars instead, so that it always remains the same size. Figure 13-2 shows a standard  alert   dialog.  Figure 13-3 shows this plug-in used to display the same message as Figure 13-2. It is  fairly similar to the Internet Explorer alert window, but it also uses some styling similar  to that used by Firefox and other web browsers, so it should look good on all major  browsers.  About the Plug-in This plug-in takes a message and displays it in an in-browser alert dialog. It requires the  following argument:   	 value  A string, value, or expression to display     Figure 13-3  A message  displayed by the  Alert   plug-in      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    363  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  divs newdiv warn ok mess html ALERT_DIV & SHADOW_DIV  & ALERT_TITLE & ALERT_ MESSAGE & ALERT_OK innerHTML backgroundColor fontFamily fontSize padding paddingTop textAlign overflow border onclick AlertHide   Position   Resize   Center   GoTo   Opacity   visible   Invisible   createElement   setAttribute   appendChild    Local array containing the IDs of the two main divs Local object used for creating new divs Local variable containing the HTML for the warning triangle Local variable containing the HTML for the OK button Local variable containing the HTML of the message Local variable containing the HTML for the alert contents IDs of the various elements created by this plug-in  Property of various objects containing their HTML Property of various objects containing their background colors Property of various objects containing their fonts Property of various objects containing their font sizes Property of the message area containing its padding Property of the title area containing its top padding Property of the title containing its text alignment Property of the message area containing its overflow setting Property of  the main div containing its border setting Event of the OK button attached to AlertHide   Subfunction to hide the alert Plug-in to set an object’s style position property Plug-in to resize and object Plug-in to center an object both vertically and horizontally Plug-in to move an object to a new position Plug-in to set the opacity of an object Plug-in to make an object visible Plug-in to make an object invisible Function to create a new HTML element Function to set an attribute of an HTML element Function to append a child object to an element  How It Works This plug-in starts by creating an array of the main two divs it uses, then four strings are  created to hold the warning triangle HTML, the OK button, the alert message itself, and two  new subdivs that will contain the alert’s title and message HTML:  var divs = Array 'ALERT_DIV', 'SHADOW_DIV'   var warn = " " +             "&916; &nbsp;"  var ok   = "   "       364   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     var mess = warn + value + '  ' + ok  var html = "  " +             "  "  Next, if the object with the ID ‘ALERT_DIV’ doesn’t exist, it means this is the first time   the plug-in has been called, so the two main divs are created, like this:  var newdiv = document.createElement 'div'   newdiv.setAttribute 'id', 'SHADOW_DIV'   document.body.appendChild newdiv   newdiv = document.createElement 'div'   newdiv.setAttribute 'id', 'ALERT_DIV'   document.body.appendChild newdiv   These statements create new divs with the IDs ‘ALERT_DIV’ and ‘SHADOW_DIV’,   attaching them to the document body. The divs are then released from their location in the  HTML, resized, and centered, and the shadow div has its opacity set to 50 percent, as  follows:  Position divs, ABS   Resize 'ALERT_DIV',  350, 140   Resize 'SHADOW_DIV', 354, 146   Center 'ALERT_DIV'   GoTo 'SHADOW_DIV', X 'ALERT_DIV'  + 4, Y 'ALERT_DIV'  + 6   Opacity 'SHADOW_DIV', 50   Next, the divs are hidden with a call to the subfunction AlertHide  , and the main  div’s innerHTML property is assigned the value of html, which contains the HTML with  which to create the two subdivs, both of which are then resized:  AlertHide    Html 'ALERT_DIV', html   Resize 'ALERT_TITLE',   350, 22   Resize 'ALERT_MESSAGE', 330, 98   After this, a number of style elements are set up, and the innerHTML of the title and   message divs is assigned, like this:  Html 'ALERT_TITLE', 'Message from the webpage'   Html 'ALERT_MESSAGE', mess     S 'ALERT_TITLE' .backgroundColor = 'acc5e0'  S 'ALERT_TITLE' .fontFamily      = 'Arial'  S 'ALERT_TITLE' .paddingTop      = '2px'  S 'ALERT_TITLE' .textAlign       = 'center'  S 'ALERT_TITLE' .fontSize        = '14px'  O 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .innerHTML     = mess  S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .fontFamily    = 'Arial'  S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .fontSize      = '12px'  S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .padding       = '10px'  S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .overflow      = 'auto'  S 'ALERT_DIV' .backgroundColor   = 'f0f0f0'       C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    365  S 'ALERT_DIV' .border            = 'solid 444444 1px'  S 'SHADOW_DIV' .backgroundColor  = '444444'  O 'ALERT_OK' .value              = '      OK      '  These statements set the correct colors, fonts, alignments, padding, and borders for the   elements, and the message alert has its overflow property set to ‘auto’, so that larger  messages will have scrollbars added if necessary to scroll through the content.  Finally, the onclick event of the OK button is attached to the AlertHide   subfunction,   The plug-in ends with the AlertHide   subfunction, which is called when the OK   and the divs are made visible, like this:  O 'ALERT_OK' .onclick = AlertHide  Visible divs   button is clicked:  function AlertHide    {     Invisible divs   }  How To Use It You use this plug-in in the same manner as the built-in alert   function: by simply passing  a value or expression to display, like this:  Alert "You must log-in before you can use this website"   Or, here’s an example that combines a string and an expression:  Alert "The product of 6 and 7 is " + 6 * 7   One of the best things about this plug-in is that you can use it to watch values changing   in real time without having to click OK after each alert message as you would with the  standard alert   function. Here’s an example you can try that creates repeating interrupts  to call the plug-in and display the current mouse coordinates, which change as you move  the mouse about:  window.onload = function    {     setInterval mousecoords, INTERVAL        function mousecoords       {        Alert "Mouse X = " + MOUSE_X + "  Mouse Y = " + MOUSE_Y      }  }  In this particular example, because the calls to Alert   repeat continuously, nothing  will happen if you click the OK button to dismiss the message, as another Alert   call is       366   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     made INTERVAL milliseconds later. If you want to test the plug-in with a single call just try a  command such as this:  Alert "This is a test alert message"   Note  Don’t confuse the two functions because they use the same letters. The original JavaScript  function starts with a lowercase letter ‘a’, and is called alert  , while the new plug-in begins  with an upper case letter ‘A’ and is called Alert  .  The Plug-in function Alert value   {     var divs = Array 'ALERT_DIV', 'SHADOW_DIV'      var warn = " " +                "&916; &nbsp;"     var ok   = "   "     var mess = warn + value + '  ' + ok     var html = "  " +                "  "       if  !O 'ALERT_DIV'       {        var newdiv = document.createElement 'div'         newdiv.setAttribute 'id', 'SHADOW_DIV'         document.body.appendChild newdiv         newdiv = document.createElement 'div'         newdiv.setAttribute 'id', 'ALERT_DIV'         document.body.appendChild newdiv         Position divs, ABS         Resize 'ALERT_DIV',  350, 140         Resize 'SHADOW_DIV', 354, 146         Center 'ALERT_DIV'         GoTo 'SHADOW_DIV', X 'ALERT_DIV'  + 4, Y 'ALERT_DIV'  + 6         Opacity 'SHADOW_DIV', 50      }     AlertHide       Html 'ALERT_DIV', html      Resize 'ALERT_TITLE',   350, 22      Resize 'ALERT_MESSAGE', 330, 98      Html 'ALERT_TITLE', 'Message from the webpage'      Html 'ALERT_MESSAGE', mess        S 'ALERT_TITLE' .backgroundColor = 'acc5e0'     S 'ALERT_TITLE' .fontFamily      = 'Arial'     S 'ALERT_TITLE' .paddingTop      = '2px'     S 'ALERT_TITLE' .textAlign       = 'center'     S 'ALERT_TITLE' .fontSize        = '14px'       C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    367     S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .fontFamily    = 'Arial'     S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .fontSize      = '12px'     S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .padding       = '10px'     S 'ALERT_MESSAGE' .overflow      = 'auto'     S 'ALERT_DIV' .backgroundColor   = 'f0f0f0'     S 'ALERT_DIV' .border            = 'solid 444444 1px'     S 'SHADOW_DIV' .backgroundColor  = '444444'     O 'ALERT_OK' .value              = '      OK      '     O 'ALERT_OK' .onclick            = AlertHide       Visible divs        function AlertHide       {        Invisible divs      }  }    98  ReplaceAlert   If you like the Alert   plug-in, you can use this one to replace the default JavaScript  alert   with it and use it all the time. Figure 13-4 shows the alert   function being called  to display the mouse’s current coordinates but in fact, the Alert   plug-in is handling the  message display, as it has now replaced the default function.  About the Plug-in This is probably the shortest plug-in in the book, and it requires no arguments to change the  default action of alert   to use the new Alert   plug-in.     Figure 13-4  With this plug-in,  all calls to alert    will use the new  Alert   plug-in.      368   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  alert  Property of the window object specifying which code to use for handling alerts  How It Works This plug-in simply attaches the Alert   plug-in to the alert event of the window object,  like this:  window.alert = Alert  How To Use It To replace the default JavaScript alert   function with the new Alert   plug-in, just call  ReplaceAlert  . The following example is modified from the one used in the previous  plug-in, Alert   to call the default alert   function, which has been diverted to use the  new Alert   plug-in:  window.onload = function    {     ReplaceAlert       setInterval mousecoords, INTERVAL        function mousecoords       {        alert "Mouse X = " + MOUSE_X + "  Mouse Y = " + MOUSE_Y      }  }  The Plug-in function ReplaceAlert    {     window.alert = Alert  }    99  ToolTip   With this plug-in, you can add tooltips that fade in and out over a period to any object, with  a range of fully configurable display options. Figure 13-5 shows a tooltip that has been  attached to the Home link of a web page.  About the Plug-in This plug-in displays a tooltip when the mouse passes over an attached object. It requires  the following arguments:   	 id  An object or object ID—this cannot be an array  	 tip  The tip message to display, which may contain HTML  	 font  The font to use      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    369     Figure 13-5  Use this plug-in to  attach smoothly  fading tooltips to  objects.   	 size  The font size to use  	 textc  The text color to use  	 backc  The background color to use  	 bordc  The border color to use  	 bstyle  The border style to use  	 bwidth  The border width to use, in pixels  	 msecs  The time each fade out or in should take in milliseconds  	 timeout  The time after which the tooltip will automatically fade out in  milliseconds; if 0 or not passed, the tooltip will not automatically fade out  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  tt  newdiv  MOUSE_X  MOUSE_Y  ZINDEX  Hidden  IID  zIndex  fontFamily  fontSize  padding  Local variable containing the string ‘TT_’ concatenated with the ID  name of id Local variable containing the new div object Global variable containing the current horizontal location of the mouse  cursor Global variable containing the current vertical location of the mouse  cursor Global variable containing the highest zIndex value so far used Property of the new div: true when the tooltip is hidden, otherwise  false Property of the new div used to cancel any pending interrupt that may  have been set using setTimeoout   Property of the new div set to bring it to the front of all objects Property of the new div containing its font family Property of the new div containing its font size Property of the new div containing its padding      370   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     color  backgroundColor  bordercolor  borderStyle  borderWidth  innerHTML  onmouseover  onmouseout  DoToolTip    ToolTipHide    FadeIn    FadeOut    Px    setTimeout    clearTimeout    Property of the new div containing its text color Property of the new div containing its background color Property of the new div containing its border color Property of the new div containing its border style Property of the new div containing its border width Property of the new div containing its HTML Event of id attached to DoToolTip   Event of id attached to ToolTipHide   Subfunction to display a tooltip Subfunction to hide a tooltip Plug-in to fade an object in Plug-in to fade out an object Plug-in to add the suffix ‘px’ to a number Function to set up an interrupt to a function at a future time Function to cancel an interrupt set by setTimeout    How It Works This plug-in first creates a new div for each different tooltip, with an ID comprising the string  ‘TT_’ and the ID name of id, and then creates a local variable to hold this ID, like this:  var tt = 'TT_' + O id .id  following code:  Next, if the div for the tooltip for id hasn’t yet been created, this is done using the   var newdiv = document.createElement 'div'   newdiv.setAttribute 'id', tt   document.body.appendChild newdiv   The opacity of the new div is then set to 0 to hide it, and it is released from the HTML   by giving it a style position attribute of ‘absolute’, using the global variable ABS:  Next, all the arguments are given default values for any that have not been given a value:  Opacity tt, 0   Position tt, ABS   font   = font   ? font   : 'Arial'  size   = size   ? size   : 'small'  textc  = textc  ? textc  : '884444'  backc  = backc  ? backc  : 'ffff88'  bordc  = bordc  ? bordc  : 'aaaaaa'  bstyle = bstyle ? bstyle : 'dotted'  bwidth = bwidth ? bwidth : 1  msecs  = msecs  ? msecs  : 250      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    371  After that, various style settings based on these values are applied to the new div, and   the contents of the tip argument are placed in its innerHTML property, as follows:  S tt .fontFamily      = font  S tt .fontSize        = size  S tt .padding         = '3px 5px 3px 5px'  S tt .color           = textc  S tt .backgroundColor = backc  S tt .borderColor     = bordc  S tt .borderStyle     = bstyle  S tt .borderWidth     = Px bwidth     Html tt, tip   Finally, in the setup section, the DoToolTip   and ToolTipHide   subfunctions are   attached to the onmouseover and onmouseout events of id, and the Hidden property of id is  set to false to indicate that the tooltip is not currently visible:  O id .onmouseover = DoToolTip  O id .onmouseout  = ToolTipHide  O tt .Hidden      = false  The DoToolTip   Subfunction This function moves the tooltip div referred to by tt to a location 15 pixels to the right and  15 down from the mouse position, sets its zIndex property to the highest value used so far  plus 1  to ensure it displays above all other elements , fades the tooltip in, and sets the  tooltip’s Hidden attribute to false to indicate that it is now visible:  GoTo tt, MOUSE_X + 15, MOUSE_Y + 15   O tt .zIndex = ZINDEX + 1  FadeIn tt, msecs   O tt .Hidden = false  With the tooltip now displayed, if a timeout has been specified then setTimeout   is   called to create an interrupt call to the ToolTipHide   subfunction in timeout milliseconds,  to fade it away again  after first cancelling any timeout that may currently be in place , like  this:  if  O tt .IID  clearTimeout O tt .IID   O tt .IID = setTimeout ToolTipHide, timeout   The ToolTipHide   Subfunction This function simply checks whether the tooltip is currently hidden. If it is, it has nothing to  do and returns; otherwise, it fades out the tooltip and sets its Hidden attribute to true to  indicate the new setting:  FadeOut tt, msecs   O tt .Hidden = true      372   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     How To Use It To use this plug-in, all you need to do is pass it an object and the tip message to display, like  this:  ToolTip 'home', 'Visit the Home page'   You can also pass any or all of the other supported arguments to tailor the output. The   following example illustrates attaching a tooltip to a link using all the available options:      Home     News     Blog     Links           window.onload = function    {     tip = 'Click this link to return to the main home page'     ToolTip 'home', tip, 'Verdana', '12px', '444444', 'eeeeff',        '008888', 'solid', '1', 500, 5000      O 'links' .title = tip  }     The HTML section sets up four links and gives them IDs. Then the   section   attaches a tooltip to the first link. As you can see by the   included in the string  assigned to tip, HTML is supported, enabling you to configure the tooltip any way you like.  There is also a standard title tag attached to the final link so that you can compare the   way it displays with this plug-in by passing the mouse over that link too.  The Plug-in function ToolTip id, tip, font, size, textc, backc, bordc,     bstyle, bwidth, msecs, timeout   {     var tt = 'TT_' + O id .id       if  !O tt       {        var newdiv = document.createElement 'div'         newdiv.setAttribute 'id', tt         document.body.appendChild newdiv         Opacity tt, 0         Position tt, ABS           font   = font   ? font   : 'Arial'        size   = size   ? size   : 'small'        textc  = textc  ? textc  : '884444'        backc  = backc  ? backc  : 'ffff88'        bordc  = bordc  ? bordc  : 'aaaaaa'       C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    373        bstyle = bstyle ? bstyle : 'dotted'        bwidth = bwidth ? bwidth : 1        msecs  = msecs  ? msecs  : 250          S tt .fontFamily      = font        S tt .fontSize        = size        S tt .padding         = '3px 5px 3px 5px'        S tt .color           = textc        S tt .backgroundColor = backc        S tt .borderColor     = bordc        S tt .borderStyle     = bstyle        S tt .borderWidth     = Px bwidth         O tt .innerHTML       = tip     }       O id .onmouseover = DoToolTip     O id .onmouseout  = ToolTipHide     O tt .Hidden      = false       function DoToolTip       {        GoTo tt, MOUSE_X + 15, MOUSE_Y + 15         O tt .zIndex = ZINDEX + 1        FadeIn tt, msecs         O tt .Hidden = false          if  timeout         {           if  O tt .IID  clearTimeout O tt .IID            O tt .IID = setTimeout ToolTipHide, timeout         }     }       function ToolTipHide       {        if  !O tt .Hidden         {           FadeOut tt, msecs            O tt .Hidden = true        }     }  }    100  CursorTrail   This plug-in can provide a great visual aid for your users, or you can use it as a special  effect. It leaves a trail of ten images behind the mouse cursor, with each image a little more  faded out than the one in front of it, so that it gives a smoother flowing appearance than, for       374   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s        Figure 13-6  Add cursor trails to  the mouse pointer  by calling this plug- in.  example, the built-in Windows cursor trail utility. It also allows you to select your own  images for the trail. Figure 13-6 shows a cursor trail created using the mouse pointer image  supplied with this plug-in on the pluginjavascript.com website.  About the Plug-in This plug-in creates a trail of images that follow the mouse pointer. It requires the following  arguments:   	 image  The URL of an image to use for the trail  	 length  The length of the trail, with smaller numbers being shorter  	 state   If 1 or true the trails are turned on; a value of 0 or false turns them off  Variables, Arrays, and Functions  j  w  h  c  newimg  zIndex  ZINDEX  GoTo    Hide    Show    ABS MOUSE_X & MOUSE_Y  Local variable for iterating through the ten images Local variable containing the width of the browser Local variable containing the height of the browser Local variable containing the string ‘CT_’ Local variable containing each new image as it is created Property of each image set to bring them in front of all other  elements Global variable with the value ‘absolute’ Global variables containing the horizontal and vertical mouse  coordinates Global variable containing the highest zIndex property so far used Plug-in to move an object to a new location Plug-in to hide an object Plug-in to show an object that has been hidden      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    375  Position    Opacity    GetWindowWidth    GetWindowHeight    createElement    setAttribute    appendChild    setInterval    clearInterval    Plug-in to set the style position property of an object Plug-in to set the opacity of an object Plug-in to return the width of the browser Plug-in to return the height of the browser Function to create a new HTML element Function to set an attribute of an object Function to attach a child object to an object Function to start repeating interrupts to another function Function to stop repeating interrupts  How It Works To start with, this plug-in saves the width and height of the browser in w and h and sets c to  the string ‘CT_’, a prefix that will be used when assigning IDs to the image objects that will  be created:  var w = GetWindowWidth    var h = GetWindowHeight    var c = 'CT_'  Next, if state is not 1 or true, any repeating interrupts are cancelled, and the plug-in   returns, which turns off the mouse trails:  if  !state  return clearInterval CT_IID   At the next line of code, if no object has the ID ‘TT_0’, it means this is the first time the   plug-in has been called, so all the image objects are created and set to style positions of  ‘absolute’  so that they can be moved about . In addition, their opacity is set to different  levels so that the ones furthest away from the mouse cursor are the most faded, the images  are loaded from the URL supplied in image, and the X and Y properties of each image are  assigned starting values of –9999 to place them well off screen, as follows:  if  !O 'TT_0'    {     for  var j = 0 ; j < 10 ; ++j      {        var newimg = document.createElement 'img'         newimg.setAttribute 'id', c + j         document.body.appendChild newimg         Position newimg, ABS         Opacity newimg,  j + 1  * 9         newimg.src = image        O c + j .X = -9999        O c + j .Y = -9999     }  }      376   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     With everything prepared, the final command in the setup section starts the repeating   interrupts to the DoCurTrail   subfunction:  CT_IID = setInterval DoCurTrail, length   The DoCurTrail   Subfunction This function performs the moving of all the trail images, which it manages with a for    loop, within which the first command moves the image for the current iteration to its new  position:  for  var j = 0 ; j < 10 ; ++j   {     GoTo c + j, O c + j .X + 2, O c + j .Y + 2   For example, when j has the value 5, the image with the ID calculated with the   expression c + j is manipulated, which is ‘CT_5’. The number 2 in the code places the  images down and to the right by two pixels.  Next, the zIndex property of the image is set to the maximum zIndex so far used plus 1,   to ensure that it will display on top of all other elements:  S c + j .zIndex = ZINDEX + 1  Then, if the image is set to display directly under the mouse pointer, the image is   hidden. If it wasn’t hidden, the user could never click a link because a trail image would be  between the mouse pointer and the clickable object underneath it:  if  O c + j .X == MOUSE_X && O c + j .Y == MOUSE_Y  Hide c + j   Otherwise, if the image is away from the mouse pointer, it is shown:  else Show c + j   Next, as long as j has a value greater than 0  and therefore is indexing the nine trail   images above the first , the image location of the image one behind the current one is set to  that of the current image:  if  j > 0   {     O c +  j - 1  .X = O c + j .X     O c +  j - 1  .Y = O c + j .Y  }  Finally, the highest numbered image  with the ID ‘CT_9’  is set either to the current  mouse location or, if the mouse is off screen, to a position well off the start of the screen   with the values 12 and 20 representing the width and height of the mouse pointer :  O c + 9 .X = MOUSE_X <  w - 12  ? MOUSE_X : -9999  O c + 9 .Y = MOUSE_Y <  h - 20  ? MOUSE_Y : -9999      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    377  Only this highest numbered image needs to be given the mouse coordinates, because   each time around the loop the coordinates of each item are copied down to the one behind  it. For example, the next time around the image with the ID ‘CT_8’ will be passed the values  in the image with the ID ‘CT_9’, and so on.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, pass it the URL of an image to display as the trail, a value for how long  the trail should be  with 1 being the smallest , and a value of true or 1 for the state  argument, like this:  CursorTrail 'mousepointer.gif', 20, 1   To turn the effect off, just change the state argument to 0 or false, like this:  For example, Figure 13-7 shows the file snowflake.gif being used in place of mousepointer.  CursorTrail 'mousepointer.gif', 20, 0   gif, with the following code:     window.onload = function    {     CursorTrail 'snowflake.gif', 20, 1   }     tip  For an even more interesting effect, try displaying animated GIFs in the cursor trail instead of   static ones.     Figure 13-7  You can use this  plug-in to provide  seasonal or festive  cursor trails.      378   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     The Plug-in function CursorTrail image, length, state   {     var w = GetWindowWidth       var h = GetWindowHeight       var c = 'CT_'     if  !state  return clearInterval CT_IID        if  !O 'TT_0'       {        for  var j = 0 ; j < 10 ; ++j         {           var newimg = document.createElement 'img'            newimg.setAttribute 'id', c + j            document.body.appendChild newimg            Position newimg, ABS            Opacity newimg,  j + 1  * 9            newimg.src = image           O c + j .X = -9999           O c + j .Y = -9999        }     }       CT_IID = setInterval DoCurTrail, length        function DoCurTrail       {        for  var j = 0 ; j < 10 ; ++j         {           GoTo c + j, O c + j .X + 2, O c + j .Y + 2            S c + j .zIndex = ZINDEX + 1             if  O c + j .X == MOUSE_X && O c + j .Y == MOUSE_Y  Hide c + j            else Show c + j              if  j > 0            {              O c +  j - 1  .X = O c + j .X              O c +  j - 1  .Y = O c + j .Y           }        }          O c + 9 .X = MOUSE_X <  w - 12  ?

Here’s the final plug-in, which allows you to touch-enable a web page. Figure 13-8 shows a  copy of the web page for Plug-in PHP, a companion book to this one, in which a small frame  has been attached to the top of the browser window with links to turn touch-enabling on  and off.  About the Plug-in This plug-in changes the mouse click action so that a click and drag operation becomes a  scroll operation, allowing users of touch-enabled screens to scroll a document up, down,  left, and right simply by touching the screen and moving their finger  or a stylus  about, in  the same manner they would using an iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or other touch device.  It requires the following argument:   	 state   If 1 or true, touch enabling is turned on; otherwise, it is turned off  Figure 13-8  With this plug-in you can touch-enable your web pages.      380   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     Variables, Arrays, and Functions  db  iid  flag oldmousex & oldmousey  Local variable used as shorthand for document.body Local variable containing the result of calling setInterval   to  be used later when calling clearInterval   Local variable set to true when touch enabling is on Temporary copies of MOUSE_X and MOUSE_Y to save the mouse  position when StartTE   is called Temporary copies of MOUSE_X and MOUSE_Y used in DoTE   to  see if the mouse has moved Global variables containing the location of the mouse cursor Global variable set to true if the mouse is within the bounds of  the browser, otherwise false Events of the document body that trigger when the mouse is  clicked and released Subfunction to begin touch enabling Sub-subfunction to scroll the document as required Subfunction to turn off touch enabling Plug-in to prevent the default action of an event Function to set up repeated interrupts to another function Function to stop repeated interrupts Function to scroll the document body by a specified amount  tempmousex &  tempmousey MOUSE_X & MOUSE_Y  MOUSE_IN  onmousedown &  onmouseup  StartTE    DoTE    StopTE    PreventAction    setInterval    clearInterval    scrollBy    How It Works This plug-in starts by making a copy of document.body in the local variable db, thus creating  a shorthand reference to shorten the code:  var db = document.body  The state argument is then tested and, if it is 1 or true, touch enabling is being turned   on, so the variables iid and flag are initialized, PreventAction   is called to disable the  default actions for drag and select operations on the document body, and the onmousedown  and onmouseup events of the document body are attached to the StartTE   and StopTE    subfunctions, as follows:  var iid  = null  var flag = false  PreventAction db, 'both', true   db.onmousedown = StartTE  db.onmouseup   = StopTE   If state is 0 or false, then touch enabling is to be turned off, so PreventAction   is   called to restore the default actions for drag and select operations on the document body, its  onmousedown and onmouseup event hooks are removed, and the plug-in returns:      C h a p t e r   1 3 :   S o l u t i o n s   t o   C o m m o n  pr o b l e m s    381  PreventAction db, 'both', false   db.onmousedown = ''  db.onmouseup   = ''  return  The StartTE   Subfunction This function first checks the flag variable to see whether touch control has already been  enabled. If it has, false is returned; otherwise, copies of the mouse cursor position are  placed in temporary variables to compare later to see if the document body should be  scrolled, like this:  var oldmousex  = MOUSE_X  var oldmousey  = MOUSE_Y  var tempmousex = MOUSE_X  var tempmousey = MOUSE_Y  flag = true  iid  = setInterval DoTE, 10   Next, flag is set to true to indicate that touch control has been enabled, and   setInterval   is called to set up repeating interrupts to DoTE  :  The DoTE   Sub-subfunction This function first checks whether the mouse button is currently held down and is within  the bounds of the browser, like this:  if  MOUSE_DOWN && MOUSE_IN   If the mouse button is either not down or not within the browser’s bounds, the StopTE    subfunction is called to release the current scroll. Otherwise, a test is made to see whether the  mouse has moved from the position that was stored in the variables tempmousex and  tempmousey when StartTE   was first called:  if  MOUSE_X != tempmousex  MOUSE_Y != tempmousey   If the mouse has moved, tempmousex and tempmousey are updated to the new mouse   location, like this:  tempmousex = MOUSE_X  tempmousey = MOUSE_Y  Next, the window is scrolled by the difference between the current mouse location and   the one that was stored in oldmousex and oldmousey when StartTE   was first called,  like this:  window.scrollBy oldmousex - MOUSE_X, oldmousey - MOUSE_Y       382   p l u g - I n   J a v a S c r i p t :   1 0 0  p o w e r   S o l u t i o n s     This causes oldmousex and oldmousey to retain the location of the mouse at the point  when the mouse button was clicked, and this location is compared to the current mouse  location to determine the amount by which the document body should be scrolled.  However, the variables tempmousex and tempmousey are used only to see whether the   mouse has moved since the last interrupt to the DoTE   sub-subfunction and to decide  whether a scroll is required. The scrolling is always relative to the values stored in  oldmousex and oldmousey, not those in tempmousex and tempmousey.  The StopTE   Subfunction This function simply sets the flag variable to false to indicate that a scroll is not currently  in operation and clears the repeating intervals. The document will not scroll again until the  mouse button is held down once more—the same action as touching a touch screen.  How To Use It To use this plug-in, call it up with a value of 1 or true, like this:  TouchEnable 1   TouchEnable 0   To turn it off again, call it with a value of 0 or false, like this:  The following example shows how you can embed on and off controls for this feature in   a web page, in a similar way to the one shown in Figure 13-8:      This webpage has been  touch enabled . &nbsp;  <a href="javascript:TouchEnable 1 "  title="Turn on touchscreen control">Activate  &183;  <a href="javascript:TouchEnable 0 "  title="Turn off touchscreen control">Deactivate  &183;  [<a href="javascript:ZoomDown 'enabled', 1, 1, 1000 ;  FadeOut 'enabled', 1000 "title="Remove this panel">x ]       When activated you can touch anywhere to scroll this page  using a touch screen         Locate 'enabled', 'fixed', 0, -100   S 'enabled' .backgroundColor = 'eeeeaa'  S 'enabled' .padding         = '2px 5px 2px 5px'  S 'enabled' .border          = 'dotted black 1px'  Opacity 'enabled', 0   GoToEdge 'enabled', 'top', 50   FadeIn 'enabled', 1000      Just add this code to any existing web page that is long enough to require scrolling.

I visit  the forum regularly and I am always pleased to hear from readers. I will do my best to try and  help you solve any problems you may have with your current coding projects.
