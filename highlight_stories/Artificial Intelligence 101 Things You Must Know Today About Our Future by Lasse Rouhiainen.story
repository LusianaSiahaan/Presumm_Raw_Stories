ABOUT	THE	AUTHOR 	   	  INTRODUCTION  Did	you	know	that	artificial	intelligence	 AI 	is	changing	our	world	faster than	we	can	imagine?  Try	to	envision	all	the	mind-boggling	benefits	of	a	world	where	AI	can help	us	to	enjoy	almost	every	area	of	our	lives.	This	world	will	be	a	reality in	the	very	near	future,	but	along	with	the	benefits	will	come	new challenges	as	well.  AI	will	impact	every	area	of	our	lives,	in	some	ways	that	we	can’t	even predict,	whether	we	like	it	or	not.  Would	you	like	to	know	more	about	this	fascinating	technology?  In	this	non-technical	guidebook,	you	will	discover	the	many	ways	in	which AI	is	already	changing	our	world,	and	how	you	can	adjust	to	these changes.	You	will	also	learn	practical	methods	you	can	use	to	apply	AI	in your	own	personal	and	professional	life.  Artificial	intelligence	will	help	us	to	do	almost	everything	better,	faster	and cheaper,	but	it	will	also	bring	about	some	considerable	challenges	that we	need	to	start	preparing	for	now.  One	common	misconception	is	that	only	big	technology	companies	can work	with	and	benefit	from	AI.	In	this	book	you	will	discover	several creative	ways	in	which	you	can	do	the	same.  Chapter	I:	Introduction	to	Artificial	Intelligence Chapter	II:	How	Artificial	Intelligence	Is	Changing	Many	Industries  Chapter	III:	How	Artificial	Intelligence	Is	Changing	Business Processes Chapter	IV:	Chatbots	and	How	They	Will	Change	Communication  Chapter	V:	How	Artificial	Intelligence	Is	Changing	the	Job	Market   Chapter	VI:	Self-Driving	Cars	and	How	They	Will	Change	Traffic	as We	Know	It  Chapter	VII:	Robots	and	How	They	Will	Change	Our	Lives Chapter	VIII:	Artificial	Intelligence	Activities	of	Big	Technology Companies  Chapter	IX:	Frequently	Asked	Questions	About	Artificial	Intelligence –	Part	I Chapter	X:	Frequently	Asked	Questions	About	Artificial	Intelligence –	Part	II  While	all	the	chapters	include	valuable	insights	and	important information,	I	personally	consider	the	topic	of	job	loss	 covered	in Chapter	5 	to	be	the	most	critical,	as	there	will	be	social	unrest	and	other dire	consequences	if	this	issue	is	not	addressed	by	leaders,	politicians and	legislators.  To	enhance	your	learning	experience	and	help	make	the	concepts	easier to	understand,	I	have	included	more	than	30	visual	presentations throughout	the	book.  My	main	purpose	in	writing	this	book	was	simply	to	share	important	ideas and	insights	about	AI	and	its	impact	on	the	world,	as	I	believe	everyone should	be	informed	about	this	topic.	I	also	feel	strongly	that	there	needs to	be	more	discussion	and	education	about	how	everyone	in	society could	benefit	from	AI.  I	hope	the	information	in	this	book	will	inspire	you	to	learn	more	about artificial	intelligence,	and	provide	you	with	a	framework	for	better understanding	this	new	AI-era	world	we	are	living	in.

In	this	chapter,	you’ll	find	an	overview	of	artificial	intelligence	from	a	non- technical	point	of	view.	We’ll	cover	some	basic	definitions	of	AI,	reasons   why	it	is	so	important	right	now,	its	role	in	our	lives,	and	several	other related	topics.	I’ll	also	share	some	of	the	reasons	why	I’ve	become	so fascinated	with	AI,	in	addition	to	some	of	the	most	useful	applications	for AI	that	I’ve	found	in	digital	marketing.  I’ll	also	discuss	some	of	the	methods	that	you	can	use	to	introduce	AI	into your	own	personal	and	professional	life,	and	provide	basic	guidelines	for creating	AI-based	products	and	services.	More	in-depth	information	on ways	to	apply	AI	will	be	covered	in	Chapter	8,	which	talks	about	some	of the	companies	that	are	currently	involved	in	AI	development.  This	chapter	was	designed	to	ignite	your	curiosity	and	share	some	ideas for	implementation.	While	it	is	not	meant	to	be	an	all-encompassing source	of	information	on	artificial	intelligence,	I	hope	that	the	valuable resources	you	find	here	will	inspire	you	to	delve	deeper	into	the	world	of artificial	intelligence	and	its	applications.  At	the	end	of	this	chapter,	you	will	also	find	a	comprehensive	list	of current	leaders	and	experts	in	the	field	of	artificial	intelligence.	These innovators	and	futurists	were	a	large	source	of	my	inspiration	for	the writing	of	this	book	and	I	highly	recommend	learning	more	about	their views	and	accomplishments.  	   1.	What	Exactly	Is	Artificial	Intelligence?  If	someone	asked	you	what	your	definition	of	AI	or	artificial	intelligence was,	what	would	you	say?  Artificial	intelligence	is	a	complex	topic.	For	that	reason,	there	are	several definitions	that	you	might	encounter.	Here	is	one	of	the	most	accurate ones	by	Google:  “The	theory	and	development	of	computer	systems	able	to	perform	tasks normally	requiring	human	intelligence,	such	as	visual	perception,	speech recognition,	decision	making,	and	translation	between	languages.”{1}  Figure	1.2.	Examples	of	Where	Artificial	Intelligence	Could	be	Used.  	  In	my	own	seminars,	I	try	to	keep	things	simple,	defining	AI	as	using computers	to	do	things	that	normally	require	human	intelligence.	For	a   more	detailed	and	complete	definition,	however,	I	personally	like	this	one from	the	online	publication	Quartz:  “Artificial	intelligence	is	software	or	a	computer	program	with	a mechanism	to	learn.	It	then	uses	that	knowledge	to	make	a	decision	in	a new	situation,	as	humans	do.	The	researchers	building	this	software	try to	write	code	that	can	read	images,	text,	video,	or	audio,	and	learn something	from	it.	Once	a	machine	has	learned,	that	knowledge	can	be put	to	use	elsewhere.”{2}  In	other	words,	we	might	say	that	AI	is	the	ability	of	machines	to	use algorithms	to	learn	from	data,	and	use	what	has	been	learned	to	make decisions	like	a	human	would.	Unlike	humans,	though,	AI-powered machines	don’t	need	to	take	breaks	or	rest	and	they	can	analyze massive	volumes	of	information	all	at	once.	The	ratio	of	errors	is	also significantly	lower	for	machines	that	perform	the	same	tasks	as	their human	counterparts.  This	book	aims	to	provide	examples	of	the	ways	that	the	development and	adaptation	of	artificial	intelligence	will	open	up	new	opportunities	and challenges	to	both	the	business	world	and	society	as	a	whole.	For	this reason,	you	won’t	find	a	lot	of	detailed	explanations	of	the	technical aspects	of	AI	here.	However,	at	the	end	of	this	section,	you	can	find	a	list of	resources	that	you	can	consult	if	you’d	like	to	dive	deeper	into	the technical	world	of	artificial	intelligence.  The	idea	that	computers	or	software	programs	can	both	learn	and	make decisions	is	particularly	significant	and	something	that	we	should	be aware	of,	as	their	processes	are	growing	exponentially	over	time. Because	of	these	two	skills,	AI	systems	can	now	accomplish	many	of	the tasks	that	were	once	reserved	for	humans.  AI-based	technologies	are	already	being	used	to	help	humans	benefit from	significant	improvements	and	increased	efficiency	in	nearly	every area	of	life.	As	the	development	of	AI	continues	to	grow,	it	will	change	the ways	we	live	and	work	more	and	more.  AI	technologies	are	now	beginning	to	offer	the	ability	to	see	 computer vision ,	hear	 speech	recognition ,	and	understand	 natural	language processing 	more	than	ever	before.	Figure	1.3	showcases	this	concept   processing 	more	than	ever	before.	Figure	1.3	showcases	this	concept well.	While	all	three	of	these	sensing	capabilities	will	be	important, computer	vision	may	be	the	most	significant,	as	it	offers	the	most beneficial	use	cases	for	things	like	self-driving	cars,	facial	recognition, and	powerful	robotics.  Consider	your	own	work	for	a	moment.	How	could	the	application	of	one or	more	of	these	three	AI	technologies	 computer	vision,	speech recognition,	and	natural	language	processing 	help	you	to	perform	your work	more	efficiently?  	  Figure	1.3.	Artificial	Intelligence	is	Able	to	See,	Hear	and	Comprehend.  Another	benefit	of	AI	is	that	it	allows	machines	and	robots	to	perform  	   Another	benefit	of	AI	is	that	it	allows	machines	and	robots	to	perform tasks	that	humans	consider	to	be	difficult,	boring,	or	dangerous.	In	turn, this	will	enable	humankind	to	do	things	that	were	once	thought impossible.  One	drawback	to	AI	technologies	is	that	machines	will	also	be	able	to perform	many	tasks	that	currently	require	a	human	touch,	which	will significantly	disrupt	the	labor	market.	AI	also	has	the	potential	to	cause political	power	struggles.	We’ll	cover	both	of	these	topics	in	other sections	of	this	book.  AI	can	be	applied	to	just	about	every	situation	and	offers	the	possibility	of transforming	our	experiences,	making	things	better	and	more	effective.  Here	are	just	a	few	of	the	fast-growing	technical	applications	for	AI	that are	currently	in	place:   	Static	Image	Recognition,	Classification	and	Tagging:	These  tools	are	helpful	in	a	wide	array	of	industries.   	Algorithmic	Trading	Strategy	Performance	Improvements:	This  has	already	been	implemented	in	various	ways	in	the	financial sector.   	Efficient,	Scalable	Processing	of	Patient	Data:	This	helps	to  make	patient	care	more	effective	and	efficient.   	Predictive	Maintenance:	This	is	yet	another	tool	that	is	widely  applicable	to	different	industries.   	Object	Detection	and	Classification:	This	can	be	seen	in	the	self- driving	car	industry,	but	has	potential	for	use	in	many	other	sectors as	well.   	Content	Distribution	on	Social	Media:	This	is	primarily	a  marketing	tool	used	with	social	media,	but	can	also	be	used	to raise	awareness	for	non-profit	organizations	or	to	quickly	spread information	as	a	public	service.   	Protection	from	Cybersecurity	Threats:	This	is	an	important	tool  for	banks	and	systems	that	send	and	receive	payments	online.{3}   While	some	of	the	examples	above	are	a	little	more	technical,	it	is	clear to	see	that	AI	will	give	us	the	potential	to	better	see,	hear,	and understand	the	world	around	us.	Because	this	was	once	a	uniquely human	characteristic,	AI	will	open	up	a	whole	new	world	of	possibilities.  AI	will	be	able	to	make	our	lives	easier	by	offering	suggestions	and predictions	relating	to	important	questions	in	our	lives,	impacting	areas like	our	health,	wellbeing,	education,	work,	and	how	we	interact	with others.  It	will	also	transform	the	way	we	do	business	by	providing	competitive advantages	to	the	companies	that	seek	to	understand	and	apply	these tools	quickly	and	effectively.  Sometimes	the	term	“artificial	intelligence”	can	tend	to	scare	people	off. One	top	AI	expert,	Sebastian	Thrun,	thinks	it	would	be	better	to	call	it “data	science,”	a	less	intimidating	term,	which	would	probably	lead	to increased	public	acceptance.{4}  	  Figure	1.4.	Artificial	Intelligence,	Machine	Learning,	and	Deep	Learning.   Machine	Learning  	  Machine	learning	is	one	of	the	primary	approaches	to	artificial intelligence.	In	short,	machine	learning	is	an	aspect	of	computer	science in	which	computers	or	machines	have	the	ability	to	learn	without	being explicitly	programmed.	A	typical	result	would	be	suggestions	or predictions	in	a	particular	situation.{5}  Consider	the	first	personal	computers	that	became	available	to consumers	in	the	1980s.	These	machines	were	explicitly	programmed	to be	able	to	do	certain	things.	In	contrast,	thanks	to	machine	learning, many	technical	devices	that	you’ll	use	in	the	future	will	gain	experience and	insight	from	the	way	they	are	used	to	be	able	to	offer	a	personalized user	experience	for	each	individual.	Already,	basic	examples	of	this include	the	personalization	you	see	in	social	media	sites	like	Facebook, or	in	Google	search	engine	results.  Machine	learning	uses	algorithms	to	learn	from	data	patterns.	For example,	email	spam	filters	use	machine	learning	to	detect	which	emails are	spam	and	then	separate	those	from	legitimate	emails.	This	is	a simple	example	of	how	algorithms	can	be	used	to	learn	from	data patterns,	and	the	knowledge	acquired	can	be	used	to	make	decisions.  Figure	1.5	below	showcases	three	subsets	of	machine	learning	that	can be	used:	supervised	learning,	unsupervised	learning,	and	reinforcement learning.  	   Figure	1.5.	Types	of	Machine	Learning.  	  In	supervised	learning,	algorithms	use	data	that	has	already	been labeled	or	organized.	With	this	method,	human	input	is	required	to	be able	to	provide	feedback. Unsupervised	learning	implements	algorithms	in	which	data	is	not labeled	or	organized	ahead	of	time.	Instead,	relationships	must	be discovered	without	human	intervention.{6}  Lastly,	with	reinforcement	learning,	algorithms	are	able	to	learn	from experience.	They	are	not	given	explicit	goals,	except	to	maximize	some reward.{7}  Deep	Learning  One	of	the	most	powerful	and	fastest	growing	applications	of	artificial intelligence	is	deep	learning,	which	is	a	sub-field	of	machine	learning. Deep	learning	is	being	used	to	solve	problems	which	were	previously   Deep	learning	is	being	used	to	solve	problems	which	were	previously considered	too	complex,	and	normally	involve	huge	amounts	of	data.  Deep	learning	occurs	through	the	use	of	neural	networks,	which	are layered	to	recognize	complex	relationships	and	patterns	in	data.	The application	of	deep	learning	requires	a	huge	dataset	and	powerful computational	power	in	order	to	work.	Deep	learning	is	currently	being used	in	speech	recognition,	natural	language	processing,	computer vision,	and	vehicle	identification	for	driver	assistance.{8}  One	example	of	this	can	be	seen	in	the	translations	being	done	at Facebook.	Recently,	Facebook	revealed	that	thanks	to	deep	learning they	are	able	to	make	about	4.5	billion	translations	every	day.{9}		These tend	to	be	short	translations	for	things	like	status	updates	posted	by people	to	their	Facebook	profiles.	Facebook	AI	tools	are	able	to	translate these	messages	automatically	into	different	languages.	It	would	be incredibly	expensive	and	require	a	huge	team	of	people	to	offer	the	same translations	without	deep	learning.  In	order	to	better	understand	the	technical	sides	of	deep	learning	and	its applications,	I	recommend	the	online	course	taught	by	Andrew	Ng,	a	top expert	in	the	field	of	deep	learning.	This	course	can	be	found	at deeplearning.ai.	You	can	also	check	out	deeplearningbook.org	to	learn more.  I	also	recommend	taking	at	least	one	of	the	online	courses	related	to artificial	intelligence	and	machine	learning	that	are	available	at udacity.com	or	edx.org.  For	the	sake	of	simplicity,	in	this	book	I	mainly	use	the	term	artificial intelligence,	although	many	times	I	might	technically	mean	deep	learning or	machine	learning.	Keep	in	mind	that	artificial	intelligence	is	often	used in	a	more	general	sense	throughout	the	book.  	   2.	What	Makes	Artificial	Intelligence	So	Important Right	Now?  What	is	it	exactly	that	makes	artificial	intelligence	such	an	essential	and special	technology	right	now?  Artificial	intelligence	and	deep	learning	expert	Andrew	Ng	probably	said	it best	when	he	described	artificial	intelligence	as	the	new	electricity.	In saying	this,	he	demonstrated	his	belief	that	AI	will	soon	power	most	of our	activities	in	society	and	business,	drastically	changing	the	ways	we work	and	live.  I	personally	believe	that	learning	how	AI	works	and	understanding	its implications	for	our	lives	is	at	least	as	important	as	learning	to	read	and write.	In	other	words,	I	recognize	that	we	are	now	beginning	to	live	in	an era	of	AI,	so	it’s	important	to	learn	as	much	as	we	can	about	it	early	on.  While	there	are	many	reasons	to	prioritize	learning	about	AI,	here	are	a few	that	I	believe	are	most	important:   	Speed	of	AI	Implementation:	New	AI	technologies	are	being  introduced	at	an	incredibly	fast	pace	and	it	can	be	difficult	to	keep up.	At	this	point	in	time,	only	a	handful	of	people	truly	understand all	of	the	implications	these	quickly	evolving	technologies	will	have for	our	world.	Obviously,	these	rapid	changes	will	generate	a number	of	challenges,	as	we’ll	cover	in	later	chapters	of	the	book.   	Potential	Impacts	on	Society:	It’s	hard	to	imagine	the	sheer number	of	things	that	AI	will	be	able	to	improve,	transform	or create,	as	we	begin	to	apply	it	to	so	many	different	areas	of	life.   	Prioritizing	of	AI	by	Every	Large	Tech	Company:	Even	Google,  a	company	that	used	to	say	that	mobile	was	its	first	priority,	has shifted	its	focus	toward	AI.	Nearly	every	tech	company	is	heavily investing	in	AI	research	and	development,	which	clearly demonstrates	the	importance	that	AI	holds	for	businesses	in general.    	Shortage	of	Knowledgeable	Workers:	Because	AI	is	growing	so  rapidly,	there	is	a	great	need	for	more	data	scientists,	machine learning	experts,	and	other	technical	professionals	who	can	build out	AI	solutions	and	services.	There	is	also	a	shortage	of	other professionals,	such	as	teachers	and	consultants,	to	help	to	explain the	implications	of	the	growth	of	AI,	which	will	in	turn	help businesses	and	individuals	adapt	to	the	new	realities.   	Competitive	Advantages	for	Companies	who	First	Apply	AI  Correctly:	Both	big	and	small	companies	can	apply	AI,	and	those who	do	it	first,	and	correctly,	will	enjoy	stunning	competitive advantages.   	Legal	Implications	Worldwide:	In	almost	every	country,	laws	and regulations	will	need	to	be	reviewed	and	updated	to	incorporate	the new	trends	of	the	AI	era.	There	is	also	a	demand	for	information	on the	ways	that	societies	can	benefit	by	applying	AI	to	various	fields like	healthcare	and	transportation.   	Ethical	Development:	As	we	prepare	for	the	growth	of	AI,	we	need  to	push	companies	to	develop	new	technologies	ethically	and responsibly,	to	better	serve	humanity	and	improve	standards	of living	around	the	world.	While	this	is	easier	said	than	done,	these types	of	policies	really	need	to	be	implemented	sooner	rather	than later	as	AI	continues	to	develop.   	Communication	of	Advantages	and	Opportunities:	People	who work	for	tech	companies	tend	to	offer	the	most	positive	outlook	on the	future	opportunities	that	will	be	afforded	by	AI.	However, outside	of	that	sector,	people	often	have	negative	impressions about	AI	tools	due	to	a	lack	of	understanding.	Sharing	information about	the	benefits	offered	by	AI	will	be	an	important	factor	in helping	people	to	feel	comfortable	with	adopting	these	new technologies.	In	the	future,	the	most	productive	members	of	society will	work	together	with	AI,	forming	robot	to	human	partnerships, making	their	endeavors	much	more	efficient.	It	is	important	to	share knowledge	with	everyone	on	how	this	can	be	done	properly.    	Collaboration	Between	Private	and	Public	Sectors:	Research  and	development	of	AI	should	not	only	be	taking	place	in	large	tech companies.	Instead,	there	needs	to	be	strong	and	open collaboration	internationally,	as	well	as	between	companies	of	all sizes,	and	between	the	public	and	private	sectors.  These	are	just	a	few	of	the	reasons	why	everyone	should	begin	seeking out	more	information	about	AI	technologies.	At	the	end	of	this	book,	you’ll find	a	set	of	20	questions	and	answers	that	cover	a	number	of	topics related	to	those	listed	above.  I	hope	that	as	you	read	through	the	topics	covered	in	this	book,	you	will not	only	become	more	interested	in	AI,	but	will	also	be	challenged	to speak	more	openly	and	often	about	it,	and	perhaps	even	begin	to	work with	new	AI	tools	for	yourself.  	   3.	Is	Data	the	New	Oil?  As	you	think	about	artificial	intelligence,	you	may	ask	questions	like:	Why is	AI	is	so	important?	Why	are	so	many	large	tech	companies	focusing their	efforts	on	developing	and	applying	AI	tools?  From	a	development	standpoint,	one	obvious	reason	for	the	growth	of	AI is	that	computer	processing	power	has	become	exponentially	better, which	in	turn	allows	computers	to	process	more	complex	algorithms. These	are	the	same	kinds	of	advanced	algorithms	that	power	AI.  Data	is	the	other	important	element	that	has	propelled	the	development of	AI.	In	the	most	basic	terms,	without	data,	it	would	be	nearly	impossible to	create	AI	products	and	applications.  One	well-known	saying	often	heard	in	the	tech	community	is	that	“data	is the	new	oil.”	Today,	the	world’s	most	valuable	companies	are	often	the ones	that	have	access	to	the	largest	quantities	of	data.	It	is	not	only	the volume	of	the	data	that	is	important	in	business,	but	the	quality	as	well.  Personally,	though,	I	would	argue	that	data	is	even	better	than	oil.	In	the years	when	oil	was	one	of	the	most	valuable	commodities	in	the	world, only	a	few	companies	were	able	to	reap	the	benefits	from	it.	Today, however,	when	almost	anyone	can	learn	the	basics	of	AI	and	machine learning	and	use	these	skills	to	create	valuable	tools,	and	it	is	so	easy	to access	free	data	sources	online,	everyone	can	benefit	from	the	value	of data.  Access	to	Data  In	the	modern	world,	we	have	an	abundance	of	data	that	can	be	used.	In contrast,	30	years	ago,	there	was	not	nearly	as	much	data	about healthcare,	traffic,	finance,	and	other	important	industries	and	topics,	so	it was	impossible	to	create	AI-based	solutions	for	basic	problems	in	these areas.  Using	the	same	logic,	it	is	safe	to	assume	that	the	technologies	we	have now	will	be	even	more	powerful	ten	years	from	now	as	access	to	more data	becomes	available.   One	example	of	this	concept	can	be	found	in	observing	the	development of	self-driving	cars	and	interconnected	smart	cities.	The	underlying component	that	makes	these	things	possible	is	the	volume	of	data	that can	be	collected	and	analyzed	to	improve	the	performance	of	AI	systems.  Data	analysis	usually	relies	on	two	kinds	of	information:	structured	data and	unstructured	data.	To	really	comprehend	AI	systems,	it	is	important to	recognize	the	key	differences	between	these	two	types	of	data.  Traditionally,	structured	data	has	been	used	more	often	than unstructured.	Structured	data	includes	simple	data	inputs	like	numerical values,	dates,	currencies,	or	addresses.	Unstructured	data	includes	data types	that	are	more	complicated	to	analyze,	such	as	text,	images,	and video.	However,	the	development	of	AI	tools	has	made	it	possible	to analyze	more	kinds	of	unstructured	data,	and	the	resulting	analyses	can then	be	used	to	make	recommendations	and	predictions.  Powerful	analytics	will	allow	us	to	apply	AI	tools	throughout	society	in	the future.  	  Figure	1.6.	Structured	Data	and	Unstructured	Data.   	  Merrill	Lynch	has	estimated	that	between	80	and	90	percent	of	all	of	the business	data	in	the	world	is	unstructured,	meaning	that	the	analysis	of this	particular	type	of	data	is	extremely	valuable.{10}		Results	from	analysis of	this	unstructured	data	could	lead	to	a	number	of	advantages	in	our modern	society,	including	better	healthcare	options,	safer	traffic	patterns, and	increased	access	to	education,	among	others.  Use	of	Data	in	Business	and	Society  Big	data	is	also	helping	large	companies	to	improve	their	internal	and external	operations.	Kai-Fu	Lee,	a	venture	capitalist	and	CEO	of Sinovation	Ventures,	illustrates	the	reasons	why	data	is	critical	to	large tech	companies	in	a	description	of	five	steps	that	companies	use	to improve	their	AI	solutions:   	Obtaining	More	Data:	The	Google	search	engine	encompasses	a  huge	amount	of	data.	Likewise,	Facebook	would	not	be	such	a powerful	social	network	without	having	access	to	data	on	people’s social	trends.	The	key	idea	here	is	that	tech	companies	can	create services	that	are	so	powerful	and	useful	that	people	are	willing	to allow	their	data	to	be	used	by	the	service.   	Better	AI-trained	Product:	With	Google	and	Facebook,	your  experience	as	a	user	is	custom-tailored	to	be	relevant	and	useful	to you.	This	is	possible	because	of	AI-based	tools	that	craft	a personalized	experience.   	Greater	Number	of	Users:	When	users	have	a	good	experience  with	a	product	or	service,	they	tend	to	recommend	it	to	their	friends.  	Higher	Revenues:	A	larger	number	of	users	almost	always	means  access	to	more	revenue.   	Access	to	High-quality	Data	Scientists	and	Machine-Learning  Experts:	As	companies	grow	in	revenue,	they	are	better	able	to attract	some	of	the	world’s	top	experts	in	AI.{11}  Eventually,	the	more	data	scientists	and	machine	learning	experts	that come	to	work	for	a	company,	the	more	significant	their	research	in	AI	can   come	to	work	for	a	company,	the	more	significant	their	research	in	AI	can be,	which	then	allows	the	company	to	become	not	only	more	valuable	but also	better	prepared	for	the	future.  These	five	steps	are	illustrated	below	in	Figure	1.7.	Although	American tech	companies	were	specifically	used	in	the	example,	these	steps	are also	valuable	to	other	international	companies	that	rely	on	AI,	such	as Alibaba,	Baidu,	and	Tencent.  	  Figure	1.7.	Data	is	Critical	to	Artificial	Intelligence.  	  Because	data	is	such	a	vital	piece	in	the	development	of	AI,	many experts	have	demanded	that	big	tech	companies	should	release	at	least some	of	the	data	that	they	possess	so	that	a	greater	number	of	useful   some	of	the	data	that	they	possess	so	that	a	greater	number	of	useful applications	and	products	can	also	leverage	this	information.  While	this	notion	brings	about	significant	questions	to	be	answered,	it	is an	unmistakable	fact	that	in	the	future,	it	will	be	important	to	have	data sets	like	these	available	for	the	continued	development	of	AI	products and	services.  This	chapter	offers	just	a	short	introduction	to	the	importance	of	data	for AI,	but	hopefully,	as	you	read,	you’ll	begin	to	think	about	the	potential	AI- based	applications	that	you	could	design	or	develop	in	the	future.	As	with many	other	topics	in	this	book,	if	this	concept	has	caught	your	attention,	I recommend	that	you	dive	deeper	into	learning	more	about	it	in	detail.  	   4.	Can	Machines	Really	Learn	and	Why	Does	It Matter?  As	you	may	already	know,	computers	are	becoming	more	and	more powerful	and	can	now	handle	even	the	most	complex	tasks.	Not	only	are they	able	to	work	faster	and	more	efficiently,	but	they	are	also	starting	to be	able	to	do	things	that	once	required	a	human,	including	language translation,	composing	music,	and	even	driving	cars.  You	may	have	seen	headlines	in	the	news	about	some	of	the	things machines	powered	by	artificial	intelligence	can	do.	However,	if	you	were to	consider	all	the	tasks	that	AI-powered	machines	could	actually perform,	it	would	be	quite	mind-boggling!  In	2016,	Sebastian	Huembfer	wrote	an	article	highlighting	100	things	that machines	were	well	suited	for	and	had	learned	to	do	that	year.	You	can read	the	whole	article	here	https:  goo.gl fgKVAu.  The	figure	below	showcases	each	of	these	100	things.	It	is	worth mentioning	that	the	items	listed	occurred	only	in	2016.	For	each	year	that passes,	the	list	only	gets	longer.  	   Figure	1.8.	100	Things	Machines	Learned	to	Do	in	2016.  	  One	of	the	key	features	of	artificial	intelligence	is	that	it	enables	machines to	learn	new	things,	rather	than	requiring	programming	specific	to	new tasks.	Therefore,	the	core	difference	between	computers	of	the	future and	those	of	the	past	is	that	future	computers	will	be	able	to	learn	and self-improve.  In	the	near	future,	smart	virtual	assistants	like	Apple’s	Siri	and	Amazon’s Alexa	will	know	more	about	you	than	your	closest	friends	and	family members	do.	Can	you	imagine	how	that	might	change	our	lives?	These   members	do.	Can	you	imagine	how	that	might	change	our	lives?	These kinds	of	changes	are	exactly	why	it	is	so	important	to	recognize	the implications	that	new	technologies	will	have	for	our	world.  One	easy	way	to	get	a	sense	of	the	kinds	of	things	computers	are learning	to	do	is	by	reviewing	some	of	the	ways	that	AI-powered computers	have	been	able	to	conquer	some	of	the	world’s	best	human competitors	in	a	variety	of	games:   	1996:	IBM’s	Deep	Blue	won	against	the	world’s	best	chess	player,  Garry	Kasparov.   	2011:	IBM’s	Watson	won	against	the	best	Jeopardy!	players.   	2016:	Google’s	DeepMind	won	against	the	world’s	best	Go	player.  {12}   	2017:	Libratus,	an	artificial	intelligence	program	developed	by  Carnegie	Mellon	University,	won	against	the	world’s	best	poker players.{13}   	2017:	AlphaGoZero,	developed	by	DeepMind,	reached	the	highest level	of	Go	without	any	human	data,	simply	by	teaching	itself	how to	play.{14}  This	last	achievement,	in	which	DeepMind,	a	leading	AI	research company	owned	by	Google,	was	able	to	create	an	AI	Go	player	that learned	the	game	from	scratch,	was	quite	a	big	deal.	Although	in	this instance	AI	was	used	simply	to	master	a	game,	similar	technologies	will be	employed	in	the	future	to	do	things	like	research	cures	for	terminal diseases.{15}  If	AI	continues	to	develop	at	its	current	pace,	can	you	imagine	what	the world	will	look	like	in	just	30-50	years?	While	it’s	difficult	to	make predictions	for	so	far	out	in	the	future,	in	this	book	we’ll	take	a	look	at	the ways	that	AI	is	changing	our	world	in	the	immediate	future,	particularly within	the	next	3-10	years.  	   5.	What	Is	The	Fourth	Industrial	Revolution	and	How Is	It	Related	to	Artificial	Intelligence?  The	staggering	growth	of	technology	is	dramatically	affecting	our societies	and	business	landscapes	around	the	world.	It	is	changing	how we	live,	work,	enjoy	our	free	time,	and	communicate	with	others.  In	recent	years	there	has	been	an	enormous	digital	revolution,	which initially	began	in	the	1980s	with	the	rise	of	personal	computers	and	the birth	of	the	Internet.  Today	there	are	several	new	technologies	that	are	little	known	by	the public	but	are	already	beginning	to	impact	how	we	live	and	conduct business.	This	adds	to	the	complexity	of	a	world	in	which	it	is	challenging just	to	keep	up	with	the	innovations	we	do	know	about.	Further complicating	matters,	many	of	these	emergent	technologies	can	also	be combined,	leading	to	exponential	growth	across	multiple	categories.  One	of	the	most	important	modern	technologies	that	will	greatly	impact our	world	is	artificial	intelligence.	However,	there	are	also	a	multitude	of other	noteworthy	technologies	that	will	change	lives,	including	3D printing,	robotics,	the	Internet	of	Things,	autonomous	vehicles, nanotechnology,	and	quantum	computing.  Personally,	I	find	all	of	these	new	technologies	to	be	extremely fascinating,	and	I	am	convinced	that	each	will	offer	significant	benefits	for all	of	mankind.	At	the	same	time,	they	will	likely	cause	us	to	face	a	lot	of confusion	and	new	challenges,	as	new	technologies	are	often implemented	at	a	faster	rate	than	the	average	person	takes	to understand	them.  Klaus	Schwab,	founder	and	Executive	Chairman	of	the	World	Economic Forum,	was	the	first	to	call	this	new	era	the	“Fourth	Industrial Revolution.”{16}  The	figure	below	highlights	the	primary	characteristics	of	the	First, Second,	Third	and	Fourth	Industrial	Revolutions.   	  Figure	1.9.	The	Fourth	Industrial	Revolution.  	  Some	experts	believe	that	the	technologies	included	in	the	Fourth Industrial	Revolution	are	generally	of	equal	importance.	However,	I	would argue	that	artificial	intelligence	is	at	the	core	of	this	particular	revolution, making	it	the	most	important	element	and	a	subject	about	which	we should	all	learn	as	much	as	we	can.  With	electricity	becoming	easily	accessible,	mass	production	and assembly	lines	were	introduced	during	the	Second	Industrial	Revolution. Andrew	Ng,	a	leading	expert	in	the	fields	of	artificial	intelligence	and machine	learning,	has	been	quoted	as	saying,	“Artificial	intelligence	is	the new	electricity.”	Essentially,	this	means	that	AI	is	the	crucial	element	for this	era	and	will	be	used	to	power	other	technologies	as	it	becomes embedded	in	our	lives.  There	are	incredible	opportunities	available	to	anyone	who	truly   There	are	incredible	opportunities	available	to	anyone	who	truly understands	the	potential	created	by	the	Fourth	Industrial	Revolution. Want	to	be	relevant	in	the	future	job	market	or	create	a	successful business	venture?	Start	studying	artificial	intelligence,	3D	printing, robotics,	the	Internet	of	Things,	autonomous	vehicles,	nanotechnology, and	quantum	computing,	and	you’ll	have	more	opportunities	at	your fingertips	than	you	could	ever	fulfill!  However,	as	mentioned	above,	we	will	also	face	challenges	in	the	new technological	landscape.	Klaus	Schwab	argues	that	the	speed	at	which these	new	technologies	will	affect	our	world	can	cause	a	number	of problems.  Humans	tend	to	experience	things	at	a	linear	pace,	so	the	exponential growth	of	innovations	currently	being	developed	makes	it	hard	to	keep up.{17}  An	additional	challenge	comes	from	the	way	that	technological	growth can	change	our	lives	very	quickly	and	dramatically.  How	can	we	cope	with	these	kinds	of	changes?	While	it	is	important	to learn	as	much	as	possible	about	each	new	technology,	it	is	also	crucial that	we	make	an	effort	to	appreciate	the	characteristics	that	make	us uniquely	human,	valuing	skills	like	social	intelligence,	emotional intelligence,	and	creativity.  Lastly,	we	are	faced	with	the	challenge	of	not	only	understanding	these technologies,	but	also	of	knowing	how	to	use	them	well.	For	many	years, literacy	was	the	most	valuable	currency	necessary	to	succeed	in	life. Within	the	last	few	years,	however,	digital	literacy	and	the	ability	to understand	digital	marketing	have	become	the	primary	skills	needed	to help	people	achieve	success.  I	would	argue	that	in	the	short	term,	artificial	intelligence	literacy	and	an understanding	of	the	technologies	of	the	Fourth	Industrial	Revolution	are the	key	skills	that	people	need	to	develop.	As	we	learn	new	things,	it	is also	important	to	share	as	much	of	this	knowledge	as	we	can	with	those around	us.   To	delve	deeper	into	these	concepts,	one	great	resource	for	learning about	the	impacts	of	the	Fourth	Industrial	Revolution	and	AI	is	the	book The	Fourth	Industrial	Revolution	by	Klaus	Schwab.  	   6.	What	Are	the	Most	Common	Advantages	and Disadvantages	of	AI?  As	AI	technologies	continue	to	grow	and	impact	our	lives	and businesses,	we	need	to	take	a	holistic	view	of	these	developments, understanding	both	the	positive	and	negative	effects	that	such	growth creates.  As	I	mention	in	various	chapters	throughout	this	book,	one	of	the	major challenges	presented	by	the	growth	of	AI	is	the	way	it	is	portrayed	in	the mainstream	media.	Because	negative	news	stories	tend	to	drive	fear	and garner	more	coverage,	those	related	to	AI	are	usually	cast	in	a	negative light.  This	was	one	of	the	reasons	why	I	was	so	enthusiastic	to	write	this	book —to	dispel	the	myths	and	misperceptions	about	AI	and	share	the	many amazing	benefits	it	will	offer	to	millions	of	people	around	the	world—as well	as	to	help	individuals	and	organizations	prepare	for	the	changes	it will	bring.  One	of	the	most	significant	applications	of	AI	will	take	place	in	the	field	of healthcare.	We	can	safely	say	that	over	the	coming	years,	AI technologies	will	be	used	to	save	lives,	improve	health,	and	help	us discover	cures	for	serious	diseases.  However,	there	are	many	other	important	benefits	to	AI	that	are	often forgotten	about.	Here	are	just	a	few	more	advantages	that	AI	can	offer, all	of	which	are	covered	more	in-depth	throughout	the	book:   	AI	and	Poverty:	AI	will	be	used	to	fight	extreme	poverty	and  improve	quality	of	life	for	people	in	remote	areas.   	AI	and	Everyday	Life:	AI	and	robotics	can	take	on	tasks	that	are  dangerous,	boring	or	difficult	for	humans.   	AI	and	Travel:	AI	will	power	autonomous	vehicles,	which	will	help  to	generate	improved	traffic	efficiency,	cheaper	mobility	options	and greater	safety	on	the	streets.    	AI	and	World	Peace:	AI	research	and	development	can	be	used	to  help	in	the	quest	for	world	peace.   	AI	and	Businesses	Opportunities:	AI	will	create	amazing  opportunities	for	entrepreneurs	and	businesses	worldwide	and	also increase	productivity.   	AI	and	Business	Processes:	AI	will	generate	improvements	to  almost	every	business	process.   	AI	and	Industries:	AI	will	drastically	transform	almost	every  commercial	industry.  As	is	the	case	with	all	new	technologies,	it	is	also	important	to	critically analyze	the	negative	impacts	AI	may	have.  Arguably,	the	most	daunting	challenge	we	will	face	due	to	the	AI explosion	is	how	it	might	change	us	as	humans.	As	AI	technology continues	to	grow,	it	will	become	increasingly	more	vital	for	us	to recognize	and	celebrate	the	traits	that	are	innate	to	humans,	a	concept that	is	covered	in	various	parts	of	this	book	as	well.  Additional	challenges	that	will	be	addressed	throughout	the	book	include:  	AI	and	the	Job	Market:	AI	will	significantly	change	the	job	market  and	might	create	a	considerable	amount	of	job	losses.   	AI	and	Loneliness:	The	growth	and	development	of	AI	will	most  likely	increase	loneliness	and	isolation	for	many	people.   	AI	and	Ethics:	It	is	of	the	utmost	importance	to	establish	ethical  guidelines	regarding	the	development	and	use	of	AI-powered products	and	services.   	AI	and	Political	Propaganda:	AI	is	already	being	used	for	political  propaganda	and	this	practice	is	only	increasing	over	time.   	AI	and	Geopolitical	Inequality:	The	growth	of	AI	could	lead	to  significant	geopolitical	inequalities	around	the	world.    	AI	and	Fear:	The	rapid	growth	of	AI	is	generating	a	lot	of  unnecessary	public	fear	and	confusion.   	AI	and	Weaponization:	Unfortunately,	AI	can	be	weaponized,  creating	serious	challenges	that	must	be	addressed	quickly.   	AI	and	Hype:	There	is	a	great	deal	of	hype	surrounding	AI,	which many	perceive	as	an	exaggeration	of	the	possible	benefits	of	AI.  The	list	of	advantages	and	disadvantages	is	endless	and	I	hope	that reading	this	book	will	spark	your	interest	and	creativity.  All	in	all,	I	always	recommend	considering	the	growth	of	AI	as	something that	will	be	extremely	powerful	for	the	world	in	general,	as	long	as	we take	the	time	necessary	to	tackle	the	challenges	that	will	accompany	it.  	   7.	How	Did	I	Become	Interested	in	AI	and	How	Can	It Change	Digital	Marketing?  Years	ago,	I	heard	news	that	a	computer	had	won	a	match	against	the world	chess	champion,	Garry	Kasparov.	It	got	me	thinking	about	how interesting,	yet	scary,	it	was	to	consider	the	ways	that	computers	were getting	better	and	better	at	performing	various	tasks	that	could	previously only	be	done	by	humans.  This	happened	back	in	1996	with	Deep	Blue,	a	chess-playing	computer developed	by	IBM.	Since	that	time,	I	always	kept	an	eye	out	for	news relating	to	artificial	intelligence,	although	it	had	never	been	my	primary interest.  Over	the	past	10	years,	I	have	presented	many	lectures	and	seminars	on social	media	and	digital	marketing.	As	such,	an	important	part	of	my	work is	keeping	up	with	trends	and	what	the	major	technology	companies	are planning	for	the	future.  A	few	years	ago,	out	of	the	blue,	I	noticed	that	most	of	the	major	tech companies,	like	Google	and	Amazon,	had	started	to	research	and develop	applications	for	AI	in	all	of	their	products	and	services.	This sparked	my	curiosity	and	I	have	been	closely	following	developments	in the	field	ever	since.  More	recently,	it	became	evident	that	the	future	of	social	media	and digital	marketing	will	include	numerous	applications	for	AI	as	well.	As Silicon	Valley	venture	capitalist	Mark	Andreessen	famously	said, “Software	is	eating	the	world.”  To	borrow	from	that	quote,	I	might	argue	that	“AI	is	eating	the	world,” particularly	starting	with	social	media	and	digital	marketing.	For	example, nearly	everything	you	see	on	Facebook	is	shown	to	you	because	of decisions	made	by	an	AI-based	algorithm.	The	same	is	true	of	your Google	search	results.  Looking	Ahead	to	the	Future  The	figure	below	highlights	various	digital	marketing	and	social	media   The	figure	below	highlights	various	digital	marketing	and	social	media activities	and	the	ways	that	they	will	likely	change	in	the	future	because of	the	potential	applications	of	artificial	intelligence.	Please	note	that	the descriptions	in	the	column	marked	“in	the	future”	are	not	based	on	fact, but	rather	on	my	own	predictions	as	to	the	ways	these	activities	could develop.  	  Figure	1.13.	Digital	Marketing	Today	and	in	the	Future.  	  For	instance,	when	you	create	content	online	today,	it	is	often	a	manual process.	In	the	future,	however,	AI	will	likely	be	able	to	recommend content	for	you	to	post	to	your	Facebook	or	Instagram	account	based	on your	past	data,	so	that	all	you	would	need	to	do	is	approve	it	for publication.  These	are	hypothetical	scenarios,	but	I	could	easily	envision	them happening	in	the	future	across	the	various	aspects	of	digital	marketing.  After	researching	AI’s	potential	impacts	on	digital	marketing	and	social media,	I	began	looking	into	other	sectors	and	noticed	that	AI	is	already drastically	affecting	nearly	every	industry,	and	many	of	our	day-to-day activities	as	well.	Many	of	these	changes	are	positive,	but	we	will	also	be   activities	as	well.	Many	of	these	changes	are	positive,	but	we	will	also	be faced	with	new	challenges	as	these	technologies	continue	to	develop. For	this	reason,	it	is	important	for	society	to	be	proactive	in	adapting	to the	changes	that	AI	will	bring.  As	you	read	this	book,	consider	the	ways	that	AI	might	change	your	own life,	as	well	as	the	world	around	you,	and	ask	yourself	how	you	might	be able	to	help	yourself	as	an	individual,	and	society	as	a	whole,	adjust	to these	changes.  	   8.	What	Are	Some	Common	AI	Applications	for Digital	Marketing?  In	this	section,	you’ll	find	some	of	the	interesting	tools	that	can	leverage AI	to	be	used	for	your	everyday	workflow,	especially	if	you	perform	any kind	of	digital	marketing	tasks.	These	tools	represent	just	a	few	of	the ones	available	right	now	and	there	are	new	resources	being	released every	day.  First,	we’ll	take	a	look	at	some	of	groundbreaking	and	innovative companies	and	apps	that	use	AI-powered	technologies	to	help	users create	better	video	content.  Why	is	this	so	important?	According	to	the	Cisco	Visual	Networking Index,	video	traffic	will	account	for	up	to	82	percent	of	all	consumer Internet	traffic	by	the	year	2021.{18}  Also,	there	are	already	a	multitude	of	powerful	tools	and	providers employing	AI	that	can	help	you	design	better	videos,	and	the	amount	of these	will	undoubtedly	increase.  Although	there	are	many	more	than	could	fit	in	the	list	below,	here	are some	of	the	most	noteworthy	AI-powered	resources	for	video	content:   	Magisto:	Run	by	a	company	based	out	of	Israel,	this	video	editing software	can	be	used	to	upload	videos	and	photos,	which	are	then analyzed	by	artificial	intelligence	programs	to	provide	suggestions. According	to	their	website,	Magisto’s	algorithms	use	three	kinds	of analyses:	visual,	auditory	and	storytelling.	This	software	is	available for	business	users	and	casual	content	creators	on	their	website	at www.magisto.com   	VAU:	This	Finnish	video	company	combines	automation	and artificial	intelligence	to	put	together	video	content	that	is	both personalized	and	dynamic.	Visit	their	website	at https:  vau.company	to	learn	more.    	Wibbitz:	The	Wibbitz	service	is	targeted	toward	publishers	and advertisers,	helping	them	to	create	video	content	from	text.	It	is primarily	useful	for	designing	video	news	stories.	To	find	out	more, visit	their	website	at	www.wibbitz.com   	Graava:	Designed	for	action	filming,	this	self-editing	camera	uses  computer-based	vision	and	artificial	intelligence	to	optimize	content by	removing	elements	that	are	uninteresting	or	unclear.	Visit	their website	at	http:  graava.camera   	Soloshot:	This	product	is	marketed	as	a	personalized	robot  cameraman.	Learn	more	by	visiting	their	website	at www.soloshot.com  It	is	also	worth	mentioning	that	Google	has	recently	launched	an	AI- powered	camera	known	as	Clips,	which	in	addition	to	taking	traditional photographs,	can	record	video	clips	of	up	to	7	seconds	long.	It	also	has the	ability	to	remain	on	continuously,	recognize	the	faces	of	users	and their	friends,	and	use	machine	learning	to	take	pictures	at	appropriate times.	This	software	can	also	learn	to	take	better	photos	and	clips	over time.  There	are	some	who	fear	that	these	cameras	might	share	their	private photos	with	Google,	but	the	company	has	released	assurances	that	all pictures	and	videos	taken	with	Clips	will	stay	within	the	camera	itself.{19}  This	technology	is	representative	of	the	newest	kinds	of	photo	and	video software,	which	do	not	require	the	user	to	decide	when	to	create	content, but	instead	can	stay	on	all	the	time	and	use	AI	to	determine	which moments	should	be	captured	on	film	or	video.  	   Figure	1.11.	Clips	Camera.   Image	Credit	https:  youtu.be JXh1yyvXpwo   	  In	the	future	we’ll	likely	see	the	majority	of	video	content	creation,	as	well as	editing	and	marketing	related	tasks,	implementing	artificial	intelligence for	better	results.	However,	the	use	of	these	same	tools	will	require	us	to be	aware	of	potential	impacts	on	consumer	privacy	as	well.  Text	and	Speech-based	Applications	for	AI  Some	of	the	text	and	speech-based	applications	available	on	the	market today	are	powered	by	artificial	intelligence.	Although	this	may	feel	like	a novelty	now,	in	the	future	there	will	likely	be	many	more	programs	and devices	that	will	allow	us	to	quickly	and	easily	translate	text	between languages	or	convert	text	to	speech	and	speech	to	text.  Below	are	two	of	these	incredible	technologies	that	are	already	available:  	Microsoft	Translator:	This	is	one	of	the	most	accurate	translation  programs	powered	by	artificial	intelligence	neural	networks,   providing	extremely	high	quality	translated	texts.	In	my	own	tests with	this	software,	I	used	it	to	translate	content	from	English	to Spanish,	seeing	only	occasional	and	minor	style	errors	in	the results.  Microsoft	Translator	is	even	available	as	a	preloaded	app	on	some smartphones,	including	Huawei’s	Mate	10.	Visit https:  translator.microsoft.com neural	to	learn	more.   	Google	Voice	Typing:	This	is	one	of	my	favorite	tools	when	I	want  to	transcribe	a	video	or	create	text	quickly.	This	tool	works	with Google	Docs	 available	at	docs.google.com 	and	recognizes	an impressive	119	different	languages.{20}  Although	I	speak	English	with	an	accent,	this	program	does	a	great	job writing	out	the	text	correctly.	Several	of	my	friends	who	use	the	software in	different	languages	have	also	found	this	to	be	true.  In	the	figure	below,	you’ll	see	a	short	overview	on	how	to	begin	using Google	voice	typing,	by	opening	a	new	document	in	Google	Docs, selecting	Tools	and	then	Voice	typing.	The	microphone	that	appears	on the	left	will	then	allow	you	to	initiate	the	voice	typing	feature.  	   Figure	1.12.	Example	of	Google	Voice	Typing,	Which	can	be	Found	at  Google	Docs.  	  According	to	research	conducted	at	Stanford	University,	voice	typing	can be	up	to	three	times	faster	than	traditional	keyboard	transcription.{21}	This may	eventually	lead	to	keyboards	being	phased	out	from	some	devices	in the	future.  For	this	reason,	it	is	a	good	idea	to	start	getting	familiarized	with	these kinds	of	free	tools	that	can	help	you	to	generate	text	more	quickly	and efficiently.  	   9.	How	Can	You	Apply	AI	in	Your	Life?  Historically,	those	who	knew	how	to	read	and	write	have	had	better opportunities	to	get	ahead	in	life	than	those	who	did	not.	I	believe	that	the same	thing	will	soon	begin	to	happen	with	artificial	intelligence.	Those who	understand	AI	and	how	to	apply	it	appropriately	will	have	more opportunities	than	those	who	don’t.  For	this	reason,	I	encourage	you	to	think	about	the	ways	that	you	might be	able	to	apply	AI	in	your	life.	You	should	also	consider	how	you	can better	understand	the	kinds	of	developments	that	will	take	place	as	AI continues	to	grow,	and	how	they	will	impact	you	and	the	world.  Is	there	an	application	or	service	that	you	could	create	using	AI?	What common	problems	do	you	and	those	in	your	community	face	that	might be	able	to	be	solved	with	AI?  I	would	personally	argue	that	in	any	new	endeavor	that	you	undertake, you	should	consider	how	you	might	use	AI	to	accomplish	it.	For	example, if	you	want	to	open	a	new	business,	think	about	the	ways	in	which	you might	be	able	to	incorporate	AI	into	it,	so	that	your	business	can	be competitive	in	the	era	of	AI.	Understanding	the	big	picture,	and	how things	will	be	changed	by	AI	in	the	future,	will	help	you	tremendously, both	professionally	and	personally.  Because	AI	can	be	applied	to	so	many	areas	of	life	and	provide	so	many benefits,	I’ve	created	a	simple	framework,	illustrated	in	the	figure	below, to	help	you	develop	new	ideas:  	   Figure	1.10.	Artificial	Intelligence	and	You.  	   	You:	In	an	era	where	we	are	surround	by	technology,	it	is	so  essential	to	take	care	of	yourself	physically,	mentally	and emotionally.	Reserving	enough	time	for	self-improvement	will	allow you	more	creative	space	with	which	to	develop	your	AI-related ideas.	Also,	creativity	and	social	skills	will	be	more	valuable	in	the future	because	humans	can	master	these	better	than	robots	and	AI products.	Therefore,	it	is	important	that	you	mark	it	as	an	objective to	improve	your	creative	and	social	skills.    	World:	Try	to	seek	out	solutions	for	the	common	good	by  considering	problems	that	are	faced	by	your	community	and	the world.	What	is	the	true	meaning	and	purpose	of	your	AI	idea?	If you’re	only	looking	to	make	money,	your	idea	will	probably	not	go very	far.	However,	if	instead	it	offers	real	meaning	and	benefit	to others,	it	will	likely	be	much	more	successful.   	Artificial	Intelligence:	Finally,	think	about	how	your	idea	can	apply AI	and	who	might	be	able	to	help	you	with	your	project.	Don’t	think that	you	can’t	use	AI	just	because	you	don’t	have	technical experience	or	a	degree	in	a	relevant	field.	Today,	almost	anyone with	a	good	idea	can	create	interesting	products	and	solutions because	it	is	easier	than	ever	to	hire	talented	AI	professionals, which	we’ll	talk	about	in	Chapter	5.	The	most	essential	skill	is understanding	the	big	picture	of	how	AI	can	be	applied	in	so	many different	ways	and	how	the	world	around	you	will	change	as	a result	of	its	development.  I	hope	that	this	framework	both	inspires	and	excites	you	to	begin	working with	AI.	Artificial	intelligence	is	the	kind	of	field	that	spawns	more	and more	ideas	the	deeper	you	delve	into	it.	I	also	encourage	you	to	use	it	as a	general	framework	for	your	own	personal	development.	It	is	important to	focus	on	your	personal	well-being	while	fostering	skills	that	will become	more	valuable	in	the	future,	including	creativity,	social intelligence	and	resilience.  It	is	also	vital	to	consider	the	ways	that	your	ideas	could	help	and	serve others.	This	will	not	only	increase	your	chances	of	attracting	quality	talent to	your	project	and	achieving	success,	but	will	also	enable	you	to	enjoy	a higher	degree	of	personal	fulfillment	from	your	project.  Lastly,	knowing	the	technical	aspects	of	artificial	intelligence	can	be valuable,	but	it	is	even	more	important	to	have	the	skills	and	abilities	to recognize	the	ways	that	AI	will	change	our	world	in	the	near	future.  	   10.	Who	Are	the	Most	Interesting	Artificial Intelligence	Experts	to	Follow	and	What	Are	Some Key	AI	Terms?  As	the	artificial	intelligence	industry	grows,	there	is	increasing	access	to	a number	of	talented	experts	who	are	willing	to	share	their	insights	into	the development	of	AI.	One	of	the	best	ways	to	keep	up	with	the	latest	and most	important	updates	in	AI	is	to	seek	out	the	opinions	of	different industry	leaders	and	follow	those	you’re	most	interested	in	learning	from.  Below	is	a	list	of	some	of	my	favorite	AI	experts	to	follow.	Almost	all	of them	have	written	books	on	the	subject,	sharing	a	variety	of	important perspectives.

Expert	systems	are	rule-based	and	normally	use	“if-then” statements.{27} 	 Natural	Language	Generation	 NLG  The	ability	of	software	to	turn	structured	data	into	understandable	written text,	similar	to	that	of	a	human	being	but	at	a	much	faster	pace	of thousands	of	pages	per	second.{28}		NLG	is	a	form	of	Natural	Language Processing	 NLP 	and	has	been	increasing	in	popularity	lately,	as	it	can be	used	to	produce	a	wide	variety	of	outcomes	such	as	product descriptions,	financial	reports	or	news	stories. 	 Natural	Language	Processing	 NLP  The	ability	of	computers	to	recognize	and	understand	human	language as	it	is	spoken,	and	to	take	action	based	on	spoken	instructions.	This	is the	basic	technology	used	by	Siri,	Google	Assistant,	Amazon	Alexa,	and   other	smart	personal	assistants.	Due	to	improvements	in	NLP technology,	products	like	smart	personal	assistants,	translation	services and	chatbots	now	have	greater	understanding	abilities,	making	them more	useful	to	humans.{29} 	 Speech	Recognition The	technology	that	enables	computers	to	recognize	and	translate spoken	language	into	text.{30} 	 Turing	Test The	classic	test,	developed	by	mathematician	Alan	Turing,	to	ascertain whether	a	computer	has	the	ability	to	“think”	like	a	human.	This	test	is basically	an	“imitation	game”	in	which	a	person	tries	to	figure	out	whether they	are	communicating	with	a	computer	or	another	person.{31} 	 These	are	just	some	of	the	many	AI-related	words	and	phrases	you	may start	to	hear	more	of	in	the	future. 	 Weak	AI,	Strong	AI	and	Super	AI  One	other	significant	AI-related	concept	is	that	there	are	three	main levels	of	artificial	intelligence.	These	levels	are	Artificial	Narrow Intelligence,	Artificial	General	Intelligence	and	Artificial	Super Intelligence.   	Artificial	Narrow	Intelligence	 also	called	weak	AI 	is	basically	the  present-day	AI	that	we	are	currently	using.	This	consists	of	basic applications	of	AI	like	Amazon	product	recommendations, Facebook	newsfeeds	and	self-driving	cars,	just	to	name	few. Basically,	the	idea	is	that	AI	is	good	at	performing	one	single	task but	cannot	handle	multiple	domains	simultaneously	and	does	not have	human-level	intelligence.{32}   	Artificial	General	Intelligence	 or	strong	AI ,	which	has	not	yet  been	achieved,	refers	to	AI	that	can	perform	tasks	across	domains as	skillfully	and	flexibly	as	humans	can.{33}		The	aim	of	artificial general	intelligence	is	to	build	“thinking	machines”	with	intelligence comparable	to	that	of	the	human	mind.{34}   AI	experts	have	conflicting	opinions	on	when	we	will	achieve artificial	general	intelligence	and	some,	including	Google’s research	director	Peter	Norvig,	believe	that	it	will	never	be achieved.{35}   	Artificial	Super	Intelligence,	according	to	Swedish	philosopher and	AI	expert	Nick	Bostrom,	will	be	achieved	when	AI	becomes significantly	smarter	than	the	smartest	humans	in	virtually	every field.{36}  Much	of	the	news	in	mainstream	media	focuses	on	predictions	about when	we	will	reach	artificial	general	intelligence	or	artificial	super intelligence	 or,	in	other	words,	when	AI	will	become	equally	as,	or	more intelligent	than,	humans .	These	types	of	discussions	can	create	a	sense of	worry,	or	even	panic,	in	some	people.	In	this	book,	we	don’t	spend	a lot	of	time	on	those	possible	future	scenarios,	but	rather	on	how	AI	is being	applied	right	now,	as	well	as	its	potential	applications,	and	the changes	they	will	likely	generate,	in	the	future.  Artificial	intelligence	technologies	and	applications	have	started	to become	a	leading	topic	in	the	news.	Unfortunately,	there	are	a	lot	of misleading	stories	and	articles	that	have	generated	widespread	confusion among	the	general	public.	One	of	the	best	and	most	trustworthy	sources of	up-to-date	AI-related	news	is	the	AI	Index.	This	comprehensive website	presents	a	wide	array	of	reliable	information	about	AI,	including the	latest	trends	and	insights	from	leading	AI	experts	like	Sebastian Thrun,	Erik	Brynjolfsson,	Kai-Fu	Lee,	and	Andrew	Ng.	This	website	can be	found	at:	www.aiindex.org   CHAPTER	II  HOW	ARTIFICIAL	INTELLIGENCE	IS  CHANGING	MANY	INDUSTRIES  	  Figure	2.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	II.  	   Did	you	know	that	artificial	intelligence	is	impacting	nearly	every	industry in	our	society	today?  In	this	chapter	we’ll	discuss	ten	different	industries	and	how	they	are being	changed,	and	in	some	cases	even	revolutionized,	by	artificial intelligence.  Whether	you’re	an	entrepreneur	interested	in	starting	your	own	business, or	simply	wish	to	make	yourself	more	valuable	at	the	job	you	currently have,	check	to	see	if	your	industry	is	one	of	the	ten	highlighted	in	this chapter	so	that	you	can	adequately	prepare	for	the	ways	in	which	it	will be	changed	and	challenged	by	AI.  While	many	industries	other	than	those	listed	here	will	be	impacted	by	AI technologies,	the	ten	covered	in	this	chapter	are	great	examples	of	how AI	will	change	industries,	which	will	in	turn	change	our	lives,	forever.  	   11.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Transforming Finance?  According	to	a	recent	report	from	Accenture	Consulting,	entitled	Banking Technology	Vision	2017,	up	to	79	percent	of	bankers	agree	that	AI	will drastically	change	the	ways	they	will	receive	data	about	customers,	as well	as	how	they	will	engage	with	those	customers.{37}		Put	more	simply, they	believe	that	artificial	intelligence	will	soon	be	at	the	center	of	all	of their	financial	services.  Here	are	just	a	few	of	the	ways	that	AI	is	improving	the	financial	industry:   	Better	Customer	Service:	Many	basic	customer	interactions	will take	place	through	automated	bot	systems	in	the	future.	It	will	be simple	to	use	such	a	bot	on	a	service	like	Facebook	Messenger	or a	bank’s	website	to	quickly	inquire	about	your	mortgage	options, account	balances,	or	other	banking	services.	As	the	technology improves,	chances	are	that	these	bots	will	replace	many	traditional human	customer	service	agents,	and	those	who	call	in	to	speak with	someone	will	not	necessarily	even	realize	they	are	conversing with	a	robot	rather	than	a	human.  According	to	the	report	mentioned	above	from	Accenture,	76 percent	of	bankers	believe	that	by	the	year	2020,	most	financial institutions	will	have	an	AI	interface	as	their	primary	point	of engagement	with	customers.{38}	For	high-end	clients,	there	will probably	still	be	personalized	services	offered	by	human	bankers, but	for	everyday	interactions,	bots	will	likely	perform	the	necessary customer	service	tasks.   	More	Reliable	Investment	Services	with	Robot	Advisors:	Even  now,	asset	management	companies	are	beginning	to	introduce robot	advisors	that	can	offer	financial	advice	and	portfolio management	services	with	little	or	no	human	intervention.	This technology	means	that	fewer	human	errors	are	being	made	and transaction	fees	are	lower.	These	kinds	of	tools	also	allow	users	to   create	individual,	personalized	settings	for	their	preferences regarding	risk	management	and	investment	styles.  The	pioneers	for	robot	advisors	in	finance	are	Betterment,	LLC, and	Wealthfront,	Inc.,	both	of	which	offer	tailored	online	services	in the	U.S.	that	allow	investors	to	personalize	their	risk	tolerance	and other	preferences	while	using	AI	tools	to	make	investment decisions	based	on	those	preferences.  There	are,	however,	some	ethical	concerns	that	using	these	types of	robot	advisors	may	create	conflicts	of	interest,	as	some	AI programs	might	favor	specific	funds	or	stocks	that	are	sponsored by	companies	that	make	payments	to	the	advising	company,	as listed	on	disclosures	from	the	banks.{39}   	Greater	Efficiency	with	Less	Paperwork:	In	the	U.S.,	JPMorgan  Chase	&	Co.	has	introduced	a	machine	learning	program	called COIN,	which	has	eliminated	over	360,000	hours	of	work	for	lawyers each	year,	saving	a	huge	amount	of	money	and	increasing productivity	immensely.{40}  COIN,	which	is	short	for	Contract	Intelligence,	uses	AI	to	review and	interpret	commercial	loan	agreements	in	just	seconds, performing	the	kinds	of	analyses	that	would	take	a	team	of	lawyers hundreds	of	hours	to	complete.	As	large	banks	begin	to	use	this kind	of	technology,	they	will	likely	be	able	to	save	millions	of	dollars every	year.{41}   	Improved	Financial	Security:	AI-powered	security	systems	can  identify	potential	illegal	access	points	to	a	financial	institution’s	data or	funds	by	simulating	various	situations	in	which	a	financial	crime could	be	committed.	Using	machine	learning	technology,	these tools	can	anticipate	how	someone	might	plan	to	attempt	money laundering	or	committing	fraud,	and	then	develop	and	implement preventative	measures	to	stop	these	crimes	before	they	happen.{42}  AI	technologies	will	soon	be	a	core	feature	at	all	banks	and	financial institutions.	As	with	any	new	tool,	some	consumers	may	be	resistant	to trying	these	technologies	when	they	are	first	introduced.	However,	just like	with	ATM	machines	 automated	teller	machines ,	which	are	now   like	with	ATM	machines	 automated	teller	machines ,	which	are	now commonplace,	most	customers,	once	they	become	accustomed	to	these tools,	will	soon	recognize	the	significant	advantages	of	utilizing	AI- powered	assistance	over	traditional	banking	resources.  It	is	important	to	point	out	that	since	AI	and	automatization	will	render	a lot	of	jobs	redundant	in	the	financial	sector,	leaving	many	unemployed, there	will	be	a	pressing	need	to	re-educate	those	people	and	help	them find	their	place	in	the	new	job	market.  	   12.	How	Will	Artificial	Intelligence	Modernize	the Travel	Industry?  Did	you	know	that	travel	is	one	of	the	largest	industries	in	the	world	in terms	of	global	economic	contribution	 direct,	indirect	and	induced ,	with over	$7.6	trillion	in	value	in	2016	alone?{43}  As	we	have	seen	with	other	industries,	travel	will	likewise	be	changed drastically	by	AI	and	other	emerging	technologies.  During	the	summer	of	2017,	I	gave	a	presentation	in	Seville,	Spain	on	AI and	the	travel	industry	at	a	conference	for	hotel	owners	and	managers. As	I	spoke	to	various	participants	in	the	hallways	after	my	presentation,	I was	amazed	to	hear	that	many	hotels	and	organizations	were	already working	on	plans	to	implement	various	AI	services.  	  Figure	2.2.	AI	Technologies	That	Will	Impact	the	Travel	Industry.  	  Here	are	some	of	the	ways	that	travel	is	likely	to	be	impacted	by	AI	in	the near	future:   near	future:   	Hotel	Bookings	by	Voice	Command:	The	ability	to	search	by voice	command	is	becoming	more	powerful	and	effective	every day.	Soon,	we’ll	find	voice-powered	reservation	systems	in	place	at many	hotels.	For	those	who	own	hotels	and	similar	businesses,	it	is a	good	idea	to	learn	what	kinds	of	results	come	up	when	you search	for	your	hotel	or	tourist	attraction	by	voice	on	Google.   	AI	Concierge	Services:	Both	Amazon	 Alexa 	and	Apple	 Siri   want	to	be	able	to	operate	in	hotel	rooms	around	the	world,	serving as	virtual	assistants	to	guests	by	activating	appliances	and answering	basic	questions.	Already,	the	Wynn	Hotel	in	Las	Vegas is	planning	to	equip	each	of	its	4,700	rooms	with	Amazon’s	Alexa	to provide	its	patrons	with	a	more	modern	and	efficient	experience.{44}  	Travel	Service	Chatbots:	As	mentioned	elsewhere	throughout	this  book,	AI-powered	chatbots	will	soon	serve	as	the	primary	method of	customer	interaction	for	many	businesses,	including	those	in	the travel	industry.	There	are	already	several	chatbots	available through	the	Facebook	Messenger	platform.	Many	of	these	will	also soon	be	available	for	use	on	websites	for	travel	companies,	helping clients	to	make	reservations	and	answering	their	questions	along the	way.	You	can	learn	more	about	chatbots	in	the	corresponding section	of	this	book.   	Check-in	Through	Facial	Recognition:	Because	of	the	many advancements	in	biometric	technologies,	facial	recognition	tools are	being	used	more	often	in	various	businesses,	helping	people	to save	time	at	airports,	in	hotels,	and	even	at	large	conferences	and events.	Facial	recognition	technologies	also	make	it	easier	to identify	and	catch	criminals,	which	in	turn	leads	to	better	safety	for those	who	are	traveling	or	attending	events	at	tourist	attractions.  Already,	Finnair,	an	airline	company	based	in	Finland,	has	started to	test	the	use	of	facial	recognition	tools	at	its	Helsinki	airport,	with the	eventual	goal	of	having	customers	check	in	without	having	a physical	boarding	pass,	which	will	make	their	wait	times	much   shorter.	Hotels	may	also	use	tools	like	this	to	replace	room	keys	in the	future.{45}   	Self-Driving	Cars	and	Mobility	as	a	Service:	Over	the	next	few years,	we’ll	likely	see	many	cities	adapting	to	the	use	of	more	self- driving	cars,	buses	and	taxis.	Since	self-driving	vehicles	virtually eliminate	the	factor	of	human	error,	their	use	will	greatly	reduce	the number	of	traffic	accidents.	Also,	because	many	traffic	jams	are caused	by	the	improper	driving	habits	of	humans,	an	increase	in the	number	of	self-driving	cars	will	lead	to	a	decrease	in	heavy traffic	congestion.  Mobility	as	a	service	 MaaS 	is	a	movement	that	aims	to	reduce	car traffic	by	making	it	easier	for	travelers	to	get	around	using	other modes	of	transportation	 http:  maas.global  .	This	concept,	which is	growing	in	popularity	and	has	been	nicknamed	the	Netflix	of transportation,	is	already	being	implemented	by	a	Finnish	company with	its	app	called	Whim.	This	app	offers	travelers	the	best	options, as	alternatives	to	driving	a	car,	for	getting	to	their	destinations door-to-door	as	quickly	and	inexpensively	as	possible.	These options	could	be	in	any	number	or	combination	of	modes	of transportation,	including	public,	private,	and	even	cycling.	It	will even	handle	booking	and	payment	for	you,	making	it	as	convenient as	possible	to	leave	your	car	at	home,	or	even	give	up	owning	a car	completely.	In	addition	to	Helsinki,	Finland,	Whim	has	also started	testing	in	West	Midlands	in	the	UK,	with	plans	to	expand	to other	regions	soon.{46}   	Other	Robotic	Tools:	Hotels,	tourism	offices,	and	other	travel- based	businesses	will	soon	be	able	to	employ	robots	in	place	of traditional	human	workers.	We’ll	take	a	deeper	look	at	this	concept in	the	chapter	devoted	to	robots	in	this	book,	where	you	can	read about	the	Henn	na	Hotel	in	Japan,	which	is	operated	almost entirely	by	robots.  In	addition,	several	AI-powered	applications	will	change	the	travel industry,	such	as	language	translation	apps,	which	will	help	tourists	to better	communicate	anywhere	in	the	world,	thereby	making	the	travel experience	easier	and	more	enjoyable.   experience	easier	and	more	enjoyable.  Chatbots	will	also	be	widely	used	in	the	travel	industry	for	things	like making	hotel	reservations	or	booking	flights,	making	almost	every	aspect of	planning	a	trip	easier	and	more	convenient.	This	book	has	an	entire chapter	devoted	to	chatbots,	in	which	they	are	discussed	in	detail.  	   13.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Improving	Health Care?  The	contributions	that	artificial	intelligence	can	bring	to	the	health	care industry	will	change	how	the	medical	field	works	in	groundbreaking	ways, allowing	people	around	the	world	to	receive	safer	and	more	efficient	care and	making	it	easier	to	prevent	and	cure	diseases.  Traditionally,	analysis	of	health	records,	medical	literature,	and	historical trends	was	extremely	time	consuming,	but	these	kinds	of	tasks	are perfectly	suited	to	AI	tools.  IBM	recently	deployed	its	AI	assistant,	Watson,	in	a	test	to	analyze	1,000 cancer	diagnoses.	In	99	percent	of	the	cases	reviewed,	the	treatment plans	recommended	by	Watson	matched	those	suggested	by	the patients’	oncologists.{47}	You	can	review	a	video	about	Watson’s	cancer diagnostic	test	here:	https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=tmI89fY_w5U  Using	AI	tools	like	this	can	change	the	way	diseases	are	diagnosed	and treated,	enabling	patients	to	get	the	care	they	need	faster	and	more efficiently.	Watson	is	already	being	used	in	hospitals	around	the	world, providing	IBM	with	incredible	opportunities	for	growth	while	also	helping to	improve	health	care	worldwide.{48}  Another	AI-based	tool	being	used	in	health	care	was	created	by DeepMind,	an	AI	lab	based	in	the	UK	that	was	bought	by	Google	in	2014. This	AI	assistant	analyzed	over	1	million	anonymous	eye	scans	to	train itself	to	be	able	to	identify	the	early	signs	of	eye	disease.{49}  There	are	many	other	examples	of	AI-based	technology	being implemented	to	aid	in	the	practice	of	medicine.	Because	AI	tools	can review	health	records	and	medical	data	with	so	much	more	speed	and accuracy	than	humans,	their	use	can	greatly	increase	the	accuracy,	and reduce	the	likelihood	of	human	error,	in	diagnostics,	treatment	plans	and overall	patient	care.  Another	trend	that	has	developed	because	of	the	availability	of	AI- powered	health	tools	is	at-home	testing	and	personalized	health	care. Using	features	on	their	smartphones,	people	can	now	perform	certain   Using	features	on	their	smartphones,	people	can	now	perform	certain diagnostic	tests	from	the	comfort	of	their	own	homes,	cutting	down	on health	care	costs	and	reducing	the	workload	on	doctors	and	medical staff,	while	also	helping	to	improve	the	health	of	those	using	the	tools. This	is	especially	valuable	in	rural	areas,	where	quality	and	timely	health care	is	less	accessible.  AICure.com	is	one	company	that	has	created	an	at-home	AI	assistant	for medication	tracking.	This	patented	technology	allows	patients	to	confirm whether	their	medication	has	been	ingested	as	prescribed	by	using	an app	on	their	smartphone.	One	study	revealed	a	50	percent	improvement in	adherence	to	dosing	instructions	when	this	app	was	utilized.{50}  There	are	also	many	different	wearable	sensors	and	devices	that	send data	to	smartphones	to	help	people	monitor	various	aspects	of	their health,	including	blood	pressure,	oxygenation,	heart	rate,	sleep	patterns, and	other	indicators.  However,	human	health	is	quite	complex	and	the	use	of	AI	technologies in	health	care	can	lead	to	several	questions	in	regard	to	ethics.	For example,	who	is	responsible	when	a	patient	receives	an	incorrect diagnosis	from	their	smartphone?	Also,	who	should	be	able	to	access sensitive	medical	information	about	a	patient	who	uses	their	smartphone to	monitor	it?  	   Figure	2.3.	Robot-Assisted	Health	Care.  	  While	there	are	certainly	questions	to	be	answered,	there	are	incredibly helpful	and	exciting	applications	of	AI	software	coming	to	the	medical industry	in	the	near	future.	According	to	Accenture	Consulting’s	report, Artificial	Intelligence:	Health	Care’s	New	Nervous	System,	here	are	the top	AI	applications	that	will	soon	be	available:   	Robot-Assisted	Surgery	 $40	billion	industry    	Virtual	Nursing	Assistants	 $20	billion	industry    	Administrative	Workflow	Assistance	 $18	billion	industry {51}  Over	the	next	few	years,	we	will	likely	see	exponential	growth	in	the medical	field	due	to	the	advances	made	possible	by	AI-powered technologies.	AI	tools	will	help	more	people	to	be	able	to	have	access	to high-quality	health	care,	provide	fast	and	efficient	analysis	of	data	for doctors	and	hospitals,	and	enable	patients	to	better	track	their	own health.   	   14.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Transforming	the Transportation	Industry?  Are	you	ready	to	ride	a	supersonic	train	that	can	take	you	from	Los Angeles	to	San	Francisco	in	just	30	minutes?	Perhaps	you’d	rather	soar in	the	sky	aboard	an	electric	aircraft	that	you	can	navigate	without needing	a	pilot’s	license.  Thanks	to	artificial	intelligence	technologies,	transportation	as	we	know	it will	soon	be	changed	forever.	The	new	kinds	of	transportation	that	are being	developed	right	now	use	renewable	energies	or	electricity	and	will be	able	to	help	people	around	the	globe	to	travel	faster	and	more	safely than	ever	before.  These	innovations	are	possible	because	of	the	exponential	growth	of various	kinds	of	technologies,	but	especially	due	to	the	recent advancements	in	artificial	intelligence.  Here	are	just	a	few	examples	of	the	various	kinds	of	transportation affected	by	AI	technologies	that	will	likely	be	implemented	in	the	future:   	Hyperloop:	This	high-speed	ground	transportation	network	was  originally	proposed	by	Elon	Musk,	co-founder	of	Tesla	and	founder of	SpaceX.	Today,	several	companies	are	contributing	to	this	effort and	various	cities	around	the	world	are	considering	how	they	can implement	their	part	of	the	finished	design.	According	to	Musk, Hyperloop	may	be	able	to	transport	someone	from	Los	Angeles	to San	Francisco	in	about	half	an	hour.	You	can	learn	more	about Hyperloop	from	Musk’s	2013	white	paper	at: http:  www.spacex.com sites spacex files hyperloop_alpha.pdf   	High-Speed	Tunnel	Networks:	The	Boring	Company,	also  developed	by	Elon	Musk,	aims	to	ease	traffic	congestion	in	large cities	by	using	a	series	of	tunnels	underground,	reachable	by	an elevator-type	system	and	a	moving	platform	that	can	transport traditional	cars	much	faster	than	they	could	travel	on	their	own. Although	many	are	skeptical	about	the	feasibility	of	implementing this	technology,	if	successful,	it	will	create	huge	opportunities	in	big   cities.	You	can	learn	more	about	the	Boring	Company	at	its website,	https:  www.boringcompany.com faq 	or	watch	a	quick overview	on	YouTube	at:	https:  youtu.be u5V_VzRrSBI   	Self-Driving	Cars:	Right	now,	every	major	car	company,	as	well	as  a	few	of	the	other	technology	giants,	like	Google	and	Baidu,	are working	toward	the	development	of	a	self-driving	car.	You	can	learn more	about	autonomous	vehicles,	including	examples	of	their current	phases	of	development,	in	later	sections	of	this	book.  	Self-Flying	Aircraft:	There	are	currently	numerous	projects  benefiting	from	AI-powered	flight	technologies.	One	of	the	most interesting,	the	Kitty	Hawk	Flyer,	which	was	developed	by	a company	funded	by	Google	founder	Larry	Page,	is	a	fully	electric aircraft	that	can	be	flown	over	water	without	a	pilot’s	license.{52}  These	are	just	a	few	examples	of	the	ways	that	conventional transportation	is	being	changed	by	AI.	Everything	that	moves,	including cars,	trains,	planes	and	ships,	will	likely	be	electric,	as	well	as autonomous,	in	the	future.	We’ll	discuss	additional	examples	in	later chapters,	particularly	in	regard	to	self-driving	vehicle	technologies.  	   15.	How	Will	Artificial	Intelligence	Revolutionize	the Retail	Industry?  In	recent	years,	technology	has	taken	on	a	crucial	role	in	the	retail business,	as	e-commerce	solutions	have	been	developed	and	small, local	stores	without	effective	online	strategies	have	been	forced	to	go	out of	business.  In	fact,	in	the	U.S.,	bankruptcies	for	retail	stores	have	increased	by	110 percent	in	the	first	half	of	2017	alone,	according	to	the	research organization	Reorg	First	Day.{53}  Amazon	has	been	a	strong	player	in	the	online	retail	market,	but	it	has also	begun	to	venture	into	physical	retail	stores,	using	new	models	that incorporate	artificial	intelligence	technologies.	In	December	of	2016, Amazon	launched	a	grocery	store	that	does	not	require	a	traditional checkout,	which	is	currently	being	tested	as	a	retail	model	by	Amazon employees.	Similar	experimental	stores	in	Finland	and	Sweden	have	had success	with	these	kinds	of	programs.  	   Figure	2.4.	Amazon	Go	Grocery	Store	 image	credit  www.amazon.com b?node=16008589011 .  	  According	to	Amazon,	this	store	is	possible	because	of	some	of	the	same AI	technologies	used	in	self-driving	cars,	including	computer	monitoring, sensor	fusion,	and	deep	learning	processes.	Within	the	store,	there	are tools	to	detect	when	a	product	is	removed	from	its	shelf,	and	these	items are	then	charged	to	an	individual’s	Amazon	account	as	they	leave	the store,	making	the	shopping	experience	fast	and	efficient	for	customers. You	can	learn	about	the	details	of	the	shoppers’	experiences	here: https:  www.amazon.com b?node=16008589011  Other	shopping	systems	that	work	without	human	clerks	are	being developed	all	over	the	world.	For	example,	there	is	a	grocery	store	next to	my	office	in	Spain	that	offers	four	automatic	payment	machines.	While their	automation	is	not	as	high-level	as	Amazon’s,	I	generally	enjoy	using the	automated	payment	systems	and	appreciate	the	time	they	save	me.  Several	startup	companies	have	begun	to	create	robots	that	are specifically	designed	to	assist	in	retail	stores.	They	can	perform	duties like	restocking	shelves,	notifying	the	manager	of	items	that	need	to	be reordered,	providing	basic	information	to	customers,	and	even	cleaning the	store	when	it	is	closed	for	the	night.  American	supermarket	chain	Walmart	is	expected	to	introduce	robots	at 50	of	its	stores.	These	robots	will	help	to	manage	inventory	and	keep product	shelves	in	order.	According	to	Walmart	CTO	Jeremy	King,	robots are	50	percent	more	effective	than	humans	at	performing	the	same	jobs. {54}  In	the	future,	we’ll	likely	see	grocery	stores	that	offer	a	blend	of automated	technologies	and	just	a	few	human	assistants	to	make	sure that	everything	runs	seamlessly	for	the	shoppers.  In	addition	to	automated	payment	systems	and	robots,	biometrics	is another	way	that	AI	will	change	the	way	retail	stores	operate.	Right	now, biometric	technologies	are	primarily	being	used	on	mobile	phones	and	in airports	to	scan	fingerprints.	However,	facial	recognition	tools	are	gaining   airports	to	scan	fingerprints.	However,	facial	recognition	tools	are	gaining momentum	in	the	marketplace	and	will	likely	be	implemented	in	stores	in the	future,	analyzing	your	facial	expressions	as	you	examine	various products	and	creating	personalized	promotions	based	on	the	sensors’ observations.  Biometric	technologies	have	a	huge	potential	for	stores	that	are interested	in	personalizing	their	promotional	efforts,	but	are	also	cause for	concern	when	it	comes	to	consumer	privacy.  On	a	larger	scale,	McKinsey	&	Company	has	begun	to	examine	the macroeconomic	impacts	that	are	likely	to	occur	from	the	use	of	artificial intelligence	in	retail.  Here	are	some	of	the	findings	from	its	report	entitled	Artificial	Intelligence: The	Next	Digital	Frontier,	which	discusses	the	kinds	of	benefits	that	can be	achieved	in	retail	with	AI	tools:   	20	percent	stock	reduction	by	using	deep	learning	to	predict	e-  commerce	purchases.   	2	million	fewer	product	returns	per	year.   	30	percent	reduction	of	stocking	time	by	using	autonomous	vehicles  in	warehouses.   	50	percent	improvement	in	assortment	efficiency.   	4-6	percent	sales	increase	using	geospatial	modeling	to	improve  micro	market	attractiveness.   	30	percent	online	sales	increases	from	the	use	of	dynamic	pricing  and	personalization.{55}  Thanks	to	artificial	intelligence,	the	retail	industry	will	be	dramatically altered	within	the	next	few	years.	Some	of	the	primary	benefits	will include	faster	and	more	enjoyable	shopping	experiences	for	consumers, but	at	the	same	time	we	need	to	remember	that	large	numbers	of	sales clerks	will	be	among	the	first	to	have	their	jobs	replaced	by	technology. This	will	generate	a	significant	unemployment	problem	in	the	retail	sector. Therefore	new	initiatives	will	be	urgently	needed	to	re-educate	and	re- train	those	who	have	lost	their	jobs,	to	better	equip	them	with	the	skills   train	those	who	have	lost	their	jobs,	to	better	equip	them	with	the	skills necessary	for	new	employment	opportunities.  	   16.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Changing Journalism?  One	of	the	potentially	surprising	areas	where	we	can	see	artificial intelligence	technologies	today	is	in	the	field	of	journalism.	Although	there are	several	ways	that	AI	is	used	in	this	field,	one	of	the	most	interesting	is called	natural	language	generation	 NLG ,	which	can	transform	pieces	of data	into	readable	articles.	One	such	program	that	is	currently	available is	called	Wordsmith.{56}  AI	tools	also	use	machine	learning	to	discover	what	makes	various	kinds of	content	popular	and	engaging,	applying	those	observations	back	to their	content	generation	process,	which	allows	the	tools	to	become	more effective	over	time.  Reported	news	relies	quite	heavily	upon	the	evaluation	of	facts	and pieces	of	information,	which	are	easy	for	AI	tools	to	compile	and	analyze. Also,	these	AI-powered	writing	tools	can	be	customized	in	accordance with	the	target	audience	of	an	article,	creating	specialized	content	for local	news	or	fans	of	specific	sports	teams,	for	example.  More	creative	and	complex	styles	of	writing,	like	poetry	and	storytelling, will	likely	take	longer	for	AI	tools	to	learn.	This	learning	process	will	still be	fairly	quick,	however.	Already,	one	AI	program	from	Japan	has	been able	to	put	together	a	short	novel,	which	came	close	to	winning	a	literary prize.{57}  The	process	of	gathering	information	for	news	articles	will	become	more efficient	as	AI	tools	become	increasingly	utilized	in	place	of	traditional investigative	methods.	One	example	of	this	comes	from	MOGIA,	which	is an	AI	system	developed	by	a	startup	in	India.	This	tool	has	been	used	to successfully	predict	the	outcomes	of	the	last	three	presidential	elections in	the	U.S.  Sanjiv	Rai,	founder	of	MOGIA,	describes	the	advantages	of	this technology	this	way:   “Artificial	intelligence	has	advantages	over	more	traditional	data	analysis programs.	Most	algorithms	can	get	influenced	by	a	programmer’s	or developer’s	bias.	MOGIA,	on	the	other	hand,	develops	its	own	rules	at the	policy	layer	and	develops	expert	systems	without	discarding	any data.”{58}  As	with	other	fields,	the	key	in	using	journalistic	AI	tools	responsibly	is	not to	hand	over	every	task	that	has	traditionally	been	done	by	a	human	to	a robot,	but	rather	to	delegate	processes	that	once	took	a	long	time	and	a lot	of	effort	to	robotic	partners.	Human	oversight	will	always	be	essential to	maintaining	journalistic	integrity	and	high	quality	creative	content,	but using	AI	tools	properly	can	lead	to	better	content	that	is	delivered	faster and	more	effectively	to	target	audiences.  	   17.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Improving Education?  In	my	last	book,	The	Future	of	Higher	Education:	How	Emerging Technologies	will	Change	Education	Forever,	I	described	the	ways	that various	advances	in	technology	will	change	and	improve	educational systems	around	the	world.  In	fact,	it	was	while	researching	and	writing	that	book	that	I	became	more fascinated	by	artificial	intelligence	technologies	and	how	they	can	impact all	areas	of	our	lives,	not	just	education.	It	was	because	of	that fascination	that	I	wanted	to	be	able	to	expand	on	the	topic,	which	is	what led	me	to	write	this	book.  Over	the	past	ten	years,	I	have	taught	online	courses	in	various	forms, both	on	my	own	website	and	through	different	universities.	I	have	seen firsthand	the	benefits	that	e-learning	opportunities	can	bring	to	students, like	providing	access	to	courses	24 7,	scaling	classes	to	meet	the	needs of	larger	populations	without	sacrificing	the	quality	of	the	experience,	and allowing	students	the	chance	to	learn	independently	at	their	own	pace.  However,	the	exponential	growth	of	artificial	intelligence	technologies	will bring	educational	experiences	and	opportunities	to	a	whole	new	level.  Here	are	four	examples	of	how	AI	will	impact	education	that	are	also highlighted	in	my	last	book:   	Personalized	Learning	Platforms:	Imagine	a	course	in	which	30  students	begin	to	learn	about	the	same	topic	online,	but	rather	than having	the	same	experience,	the	course	could	be	personalized	in 30	different	ways,	customized	to	the	previous	knowledge	and	skills of	each	student,	making	it	a	more	enjoyable	and	successful learning	experience	for	all.	Not	only	could	each	individual	student study	at	their	own	pace,	but	instructors	could	also	provide	each student	with	personalized	feedback,	support	and	motivation.	As	a result,	each	of	the	30	students	would	maximize	their	own	learning experience	attained	from	the	course,	and	student	dropout	rates would	decrease.    	Individualized	Artificial	Intelligence	Tutors:	One	application	of  this	kind	of	tutor	would	be	a	personalized	AI	teaching	assistant created	for	a	particular	course,	to	perform	tasks	such	as	answering basic	questions	from	students	regarding	a	given	topic	 such	as deadlines	or	assignment	formats ,	helping	to	keep	students	on track	with	coursework	as	needed,	or	providing	information	about the	university	or	institution.	In	most	cases,	such	AI	teaching assistants	could	be	run	through	voice	recognition	software,	which would	allow	the	students	to	speak	directly	to	them.	These	AI	tutors could	also	incorporate	additional	data,	such	as	personality	test results,	to	enable	them	to	personalize	responses	to	individual students.   	Personalized	Games:	Several	recent	studies	have	revealed	that  playing	games	can	be	one	of	the	best	ways	to	learn	something new.	Creating	effective	games,	however,	requires	a	lot	of	time	and creativity,	which	can	be	challenging.	As	we	employ	artificial intelligence	tools,	the	generation	of	these	kinds	of	games	will become	easier,	allowing	instructors	to	customize	games	to	their students’	personalities	and	learning	needs.	With	these	highly entertaining	games,	students	will	benefit	from	increased	motivation and	enjoyment,	leading	to	better	learning.   	Crafting	a	More	Enjoyable	Learning	Experience:	Another  potential	benefit	of	AI	tools	in	the	field	of	education	is	their	ability	to keep	students	engaged	in	the	coursework	by	making	the experience	more	fun.	It	is	easy	to	see	why	students	who	have	fun while	they	learn	tend	to	remember	the	material	better,	making	the learning	experience	more	effective.	In	the	future,	learning	platforms powered	by	AI	will	be	able	to	incorporate	interactive	tools	designed to	continuously	engage	the	learner,	dispelling	boredom	and	lack	of motivation.{59}  This	is	just	a	small	taste	of	the	ways	that	AI	can	potentially	change	the future	of	education.	While	not	everything	mentioned	above	is	available	on the	market	today,	there	are	numerous	companies	currently	developing tools	to	make	these	experiences	possible	soon.  Additionally,	AI	will	make	it	easier	for	teachers	to	do	their	jobs	effectively.   Additionally,	AI	will	make	it	easier	for	teachers	to	do	their	jobs	effectively. For	example,	AI-powered	tutors	can	provide	teachers	with	feedback, sharing	meaningful	insights	into	the	performance	of	individual	students, thereby	enabling	teachers	to	improve	their	teaching	methods	and personalize	coursework	to	better	meet	the	needs	of	their	students.  AI	will	also	allow	teachers	to	focus	more	on	mentoring	their	students, inspiring	them	to	learn,	and	less	on	menial	or	repetitive	tasks	such	as grading	papers	and	sending	out	reminders.  As	learning	platforms	become	more	powerful	and	accessible	through	the help	of	AI	tools,	they	will	lower	the	costs	of	education,	perhaps	even bringing	free	educational	opportunities	to	remote	or	underdeveloped areas.  When	it	comes	to	education,	I	would	urge	all	universities	and	educational institutions	to	swiftly	add	to	their	curriculums	more	courses	related	to artificial	intelligence,	like	machine	learning	and	deep	learning.	Since	the workplace	of	the	future	will	need	many	employees	who	understand	the drastic	changes	created	by	AI	and	how	we	can	adapt	to	them,	artificial intelligence	should	be	taught	to	everyone,	not	just	computer	science students.  At	the	same	time,	it	is	advisable	to	also	teach	“people	skills”	such	as emotional	intelligence,	social	intelligence	and	creativity,	since	the	value	of those	skills	will	increase	significantly	in	tomorrow's	workplace	as	well.  As	Nelson	Mandela	once	said,	“education	is	the	most	powerful	weapon which	you	can	use	to	change	the	world.”	With	the	help	of	AI,	we	are starting	to	see	the	benefits	of	those	changes	right	now.  	   18.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Revolutionizing Agriculture?  Did	you	know	that	roughly	70	percent	of	the	fresh	water	supply	in	the world	is	used	for	agriculture	?{60}	How	about	the	fact	that	giving	up	meat at	meals	would	do	more	to	save	the	environment	than	giving	up	your	car ?{61}  Agriculture	is	one	the	primary	areas	where	AI	can	make	a	substantial impact	on	the	sustainability	of	resources	and	our	quality	of	life.	Although agriculture	is	one	of	the	oldest	practices	in	the	world,	AI	can	provide	new opportunities	that	will	change	the	way	we	farm	forever.  Here	are	some	of	the	technologies	that	can	make	this	possible:   	Agricultural	Drones:	These	robotic,	unmanned	drones	are	able	to  monitor	the	growth	and	production	of	crops,	while	also	identifying weeds	and	damaged	plants.	Additionally,	they	can	be	deployed	to analyze	the	potential	of	a	given	terrain	using	cameras	and	other sensors	for	precision	farming.	Already,	the	market	for	agricultural drones	is	on	track	to	exceed	$1	billion	in	value	by	the	year	2024, according	to	Global	Market	Insights.{62}   	Autonomous	Tractors:	Self-driving	tractors	can	reduce	the workload	on	farm	staff,	while	collecting	information	about	the conditions	and	moisture	of	the	soil	from	attached	sensors.	The	data gathered	and	human	labor	spared	by	this	kind	of	equipment	can lead	to	better	farming	practices	and	lowered	fuel	and	labor	costs, offering	a	greater	return	on	investment	than	traditional	farming tools.	Since	the	technology	is	in	its	early	stages,	it	will	most	likely require	some	form	of	human	participation,	although	the	end	goal will	be	completely	unmanned	operation.{63}   	Vertical	Farms	Powered	by	AI:	Vertical	farming	is	the	term	used  to	describe	the	growth	of	crops	in	a	controlled	environment,	usually without	soil	or	natural	light.	According	to	a	number	of	experts,	this type	of	farming	will	help	to	ease	food	shortages	around	the	world.   Because	of	the	delicacy	of	this	kind	of	farming,	artificial	intelligence can	be	used	to	assist	in	its	analysis	and	tracking.  Bowery	Farming	 http:  www.boweryfarming.com 	is	one	company	that has	developed	its	own	system,	which	relies	on	computer	monitoring	and machine	learning	to	track	the	growth	of	plants	using	sensors	for	light	and nutrients.	This	system	can	also	recommend	when	to	harvest	certain plants,	a	task	that	would	otherwise	require	careful	human	monitoring	and intuition.{64}  Figure	2.5.	Agricultural	Drone	Flying	Over	Fields.  	  Additionally,	the	agricultural	industry	can	benefit	tremendously	from	the Internet	of	Things	 IoT 	and	the	development	of	new	kinds	of	sensors, which	will	make	it	easier	to	perform	duties	that	previously	required	human labor,	such	as	monitoring	the	health	and	wellbeing	of	livestock.  As	AI	technologies	continue	to	be	deployed	in	agriculture,	they	will	bring increasing	returns	on	investment	and	offer	many	potential	solutions	to traditional	agricultural	problems,	such	as	lack	of	space,	droughts,	or	food   traditional	agricultural	problems,	such	as	lack	of	space,	droughts,	or	food shortages.  	   19.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Altering	the	World of	Entertainment?  In	October	of	2016,	I	was	a	presenter	at	a	video	marketing	conference	in Los	Angeles	called	VidSummit,	which	gathers	some	of	the	best	video marketers	in	the	industry.  During	my	presentation,	I	shared	that	one	important	aspect	to	consider	in the	future	of	video	marketing	is	the	impact	of	artificial	intelligence,	as	at least	part	of	the	traditional	video	editing	process	will	likely	be	done	by	AI- powered	tools.	This	surprised	much	of	my	audience,	many	of	whom approached	me	afterwards,	excited	to	learn	more	about	the	potential uses	of	AI	in	their	own	professional	endeavors.  As	with	many	other	industries,	AI	technologies	will	soon	play	a	large	role in	the	entertainment	business,	taking	over	tasks	like	data	collection, market	research,	and	even	content	creation.  Here	are	just	a	few	of	the	ways	that	AI	is	being	introduced	into	the entertainment	industry:   	Trailers	Edited	by	AI:	Already,	IBM’s	Watson	has	created	the	first movie	trailer	produced	entirely	by	an	AI-based	resource.	This	was accomplished	via	the	use	of	intelligent	learning	processes, combined	with	the	analysis	of	over	100	trailers	for	similar	films, enabling	Watson	to	discover	the	components	that	come	together	to make	a	high-quality	movie	trailer.	These	analyses	included elements	like	points	of	view,	audio,	visuals,	and	emotional	tones, as	well	as	the	movie	in	its	entirety.  The	film	for	which	Watson	created	this	trailer	is	called	Morgan,	and it	would	be	difficult	for	most	people	to	recognize	that	it	was	not produced	by	a	professional	human	trailer	editor.{65}	You	can	watch a	YouTube	video	that	describes	the	trailer’s	creation	process	here: https:  youtu.be gJEzuYynaiw  	   Figure	2.6.	Trailer	for	the	Movie	Morgan   image	credit	https:  youtu.be gJEzuYynaiw .  	   	Facial	Recognition	and	Analysis:	In	addition	to	facial	recognition  tools	being	introduced	at	hotels,	airports	and	retail	stores,	large entertainment	companies	are	now	able	to	use	this	technology	to analyze	the	facial	expressions	of	audience	members	to	determine their	reactions	to	certain	kinds	of	viewing	content.  This	is	a	great	way	for	studios	to	receive	accurate	audience feedback,	which	could	help	them	to	improve	their	bottom	line	in	a business	that	is	often	expensive	and	risky.  Obviously,	there	are	some	directors	who	are	so	highly	invested	in maintaining	creative	control	of	their	content	that	they	would	be	resistant to	the	introduction	of	AI	tools	into	their	filmmaking	process.	However,	it will	probably	be	the	largest	movie	studios	that	will	want	to	gain	the	market leverage	offered	by	AI	insights	and	will	therefore	adopt	these technologies	first.{66}  In	the	end,	the	best	potential	for	truly	high-quality	creative	content	will probably	come	from	a	mixture	of	AI	tools	and	human	talents.   	Pop	Songs	Produced	by	AI:	In	September	of	2016,	Sony  announced	that	its	research	laboratory	had	created	a	system	that   was	able	to	produce	music	based	on	certain	algorithms{67}	.	To accomplish	this,	its	AI	assistant	analyzed	13,000	samples	of	music and	was	then	programmed	to	be	able	to	create	songs	in	different styles.	With	this	technology,	the	potential	for	rapid	content	creation that	fits	into	various	music	genres	is	endless.  Historically	the	entertainment	field	has	been	heavily	associated	with creativity,	which	might	lead	some	to	think	that	this	is	one	industry	that	will not	embrace	AI	tools	as	eagerly.	However,	the	race	to	gain	market	share and	profits	in	many	of	the	largest	studios	in	Hollywood	may	prove	to	be	a powerful	incentive	for	the	use	of	AI	tools	in	the	creative	process.	In	the end,	the	best	potential	for	truly	high-quality	creative	content	will	probably come	from	a	mixture	of	AI	tools	and	human	talents.  As	AI	tools	are	used	in	conjunction	with	other	developing	technologies, like	virtual	reality,	there	is	even	greater	potential	to	create	impactful	and immersive	entertainment	experiences,	leading	some	experts	to	fear	that people	will	be	left	with	fewer	opportunities	to	interact	with	others	and	to develop	crucial	social	skills.	For	this	reason,	the	best	results	will	likely come	from	moderate	and	discerning	use	of	these	technologies.  	   20.	How	Will	Artificial	Intelligence	Impact Governments?  Although	some	may	not	think	of	government	as	being	an	industry,	it	is	an important	field	that	will	be	strongly	impacted	by	artificial	intelligence technologies.  Here	are	two	concrete	examples	of	the	ways	that	AI	technologies	can improve	the	processes	and	tasks	of	governments	around	the	world:   	Public	Safety	and	Security:	Although	it	may	never	happen	as  portrayed	in	the	2002	futuristic	movie	Minority	Report,	starring	Tom Cruise,	some	police	departments	have	already	begun	using	AI- based	software	to	predict	crime	trends	and	form	solutions	in advance.	The	nature	of	machine	learning	makes	it	a	perfect technology	for	crime	prediction	and	prevention.  One	such	tool	that	provides	customized	reports	of	potential locations	and	windows	of	time	in	which	crime	is	more	likely	to	occur is	known	as	PredPol.	This	software	analyzes	various	kinds	of crimes,	including	the	locations	in	which	they	are	committed,	along with	the	dates	and	times,	to	produce	its	predictive	reports.{68}  As	of	the	time	of	this	writing,	there	is	no	independent	research available	analyzing	the	effectiveness	of	the	PredPol	system,	but	if	it can	perform	as	described,	it	will	be	able	to	provide	significant	help for	state	and	federal	police	forces.  However,	one	concern	raised	by	experts	against	this	type	of technology	is	that	it	may	lead	to	an	increase	in	racial	profiling	and other	forms	of	bias	against	minorities.{69}  Another	type	of	AI	tool	that	can	be	beneficial	for	public	safety	and security	is	biometric	facial	recognition	technology,	which	can	help with	tasks	like	border	control,	identifying	criminals	much	more effectively	than	traditional	passport	monitoring.	These	tools	can also	make	screening	processes	faster,	but	may	raise	privacy concerns	for	travelers.    	Bureaucratic	Efficiency:	As	we’ll	see	in	other	industries,  government	workers	can	save	huge	amounts	of	time	by	automating basic,	repetitive	tasks,	like	data	entry	and	analysis.	According	to	a report	from	Deloitte	entitled	AI-Augmented	Government, automation	measures	could	save	the	federal	government	over	96.7 million	man-hours	and	over	$3.3	billion	annually	in	the	U.S.	alone. {70}  In	many	countries,	red	tape	and	documentation	create	huge challenges	for	governments,	limiting	their	efficiency	and effectiveness.  There	are	many	other	potential	benefits	that	governments	can discover	by	implementing	AI	solutions.	The	governments	that	adapt quickly	and	educate	their	citizens	and	institutions	about	these technologies	will	experience	the	most	extensive	benefits	from them.  The	governments	of	some	countries,	such	as	Finland,	Canada,	the UK	and	China,	have	assembled	specific	committees	and	research groups	to	provide	consulting	services	and	recommendations	to those	governments	regarding	the	growth	of	AI	and	how	their countries	could	benefit	from	it.	All	countries’	governments	should follow	this	example,	being	proactive	and	working	together	to research	the	best	ways	for	society	to	adapt	to,	and	benefit	from, the	rapid	growth	of	artificial	intelligence.

In	this	chapter,	you’ll	learn	about	ten	different	business	processes	that will	be	drastically	altered,	becoming	exponentially	more	efficient,	with	the introduction	of	AI-powered	tools.  Are	you	aware	of	the	many	ways	in	which	artificial	intelligence	will	forever change	how	business	is	done?  Businesses	of	all	sizes,	even	individual	entrepreneurs,	will	be	able	to improve	almost	all	of	these	processes	with	the	help	of	AI	tools.  I	would	love	to	see	more	business	owners	becoming	familiar	with	the benefits	and	applications	of	artificial	intelligence,	as	early	adoption	of these	tools	will	provide	them	with	a	huge	competitive	advantage.  In	this	chapter,	I	have	provided	several	examples	of	how	AI-powered tools	are	being	applied	in	business.	As	you	read,	consider	which	two processes	within	your	business	you’d	like	to	improve	first	with	the application	of	AI	tools,	and	then	develop	a	plan	of	action	to	get	started.  Antti	Merilehto,	author	of	the	book	AI	for	Business	Leaders,	shares	this recommendation	with	companies	that	are	interested	in	applying	AI:  “The	growth	of	artificial	intelligence	is	crucial	for	all	businesses.	The moment	when	AI	will	be	democratized,	it	means	that	all	companies	willing to	use	AI	have	the	possibility	to	do	that.  In	the	beginning	you	can	take	advantage	by	leveraging	good	quality	data, but	the	key	issue	for	your	company	will	be	how	you	apply	that	to	solve your	business	problems,	your	customers’	problems.	Create	great services	based	on	good	data.  Time	for	just	defining	new	concepts	is	gone,	and	it	is	the	time	to	start running	small	experiments	with	your	own	data	to	achieve	small	wins.  The	impact	of	artificial	intelligence	in	business	will	grow	significantly	in the	next	two	years,	so	it’s	best	to	start	taking	action	today.	And	don't worry	too	much,	as	most	other	businesses	are	also	just	starting.”  -	Antti	Merilehto,   author	of	the	book	AI	for	Business	Leaders  	   21.	How	Can	Your	Business	Use	Smart	Virtual Personal	Assistants?  Chances	are	that	you’ve	already	encountered	and	used	some	of	the basic	AI	assistants	that	are	available	today,	such	as	Siri	from	Apple, Cortana	on	the	Windows	operating	system,	or	Google	Voice	Search, which	is	available	through	the	Google	Assistant	app.	These	basic assistants	can	help	you	to	do	things	like	open	programs,	find	out	about the	weather,	or	get	directions.  The	latest	version	of	Apple’s	Siri	can	perform	tasks	in	third	party applications,	such	as	send	a	message	to	your	LinkedIn	friend	or	send	a WhatsApp	message	to	your	spouse	by	following	your	voice	command. According	to	Gartner,	Inc.,	a	leading	information	technology	research company,	20	percent	of	user	interactions	with	smartphones	will	take place	via	virtual	personal	assistants	by	2019.{71}  As	of	the	time	of	this	writing,	most	of	these	assistants	are	unable	to perform	more	complicated	tasks,	like	making	hotel	reservations	or conducting	high-level	research	into	a	topic	or	question.	As	the	technology is	improving	all	the	time,	it’s	very	likely	that	these	tools	will	become	more powerful	over	the	next	few	years,	offering	more	advanced	features.  If	you’re	just	getting	started	with	AI	assistants,	there	are	several	tools	that allow	you	to	give	voice	commands	for	basic,	everyday	tasks.	Windows’ Cortana	responds	to	commands	to	organize	your	files	or	open	specific apps.  Many	consider	Amazon’s	Alexa	to	be	a	leader	in	this	space.	In	addition	to being	able	to	perform	simple	tasks	like	turning	on	music	or	activating appliances	in	your	home,	third	party	applications	can	be	built	and	added to	Alexa.	These	are	called	“skills,”	of	which	Alexa	has	more	than	25,000 as	of	the	time	of	writing	this	book.{72}  These	skills	range	from	simple	tasks	to	more	complicated	ones	like booking	hotel	rooms.{73}	.	Some	experts	believe	that	Amazon	Alexa	may be	one	of	the	most	advanced	virtual	assistants	on	the	market	today.   	  Figure	3.2.	Amazon	Echo,	a	Product	Powered	by	Amazon	Alexa.  	  Google	has	developed	a	similar	assistant	called	Google	Home,	which	is also	getting	a	lot	of	attention	and	can	perform	a	wide	variety	of	tasks. However,	Amazon	Alexa	still	seems	to	be	the	leader	in	this	market.  These	tools	offer	excellent,	free	services	that	can	allow	you	to	become familiar	with	voice	commands,	a	feature	that	is	likely	to	be	available	on many	devices	in	the	near	future.	They	can	also	help	you	to	save	time	and energy	on	tasks	throughout	your	day.  Here	are	some	of	the	other	AI	assistants	that	are	available	on	the	market today:    	Facebook	M:	As	of	the	time	of	this	writing,	access	is	still	limited	for this	assistant.	When	it	is	released	to	everyone,	it	is	likely	to	become one	of	the	most	powerful	AI	assistants	available,	performing	more complex	tasks	like	requesting	refunds	on	purchases.   	X.AI:	This	AI	assistant	was	created	for	one	purpose:	to	schedule  meetings.	To	learn	more	about	it,	you	can	type	x.ai	into	your Internet	browser.   	Brin.ai:	Available	at	http:  brin.ai	for	iOS	or	Android	operating  systems,	this	is	a	business	advisor	assistant	that	provides reminders	and	tips	on	the	best	ways	to	run	your	business successfully.	When	I	first	started	using	this	assistant,	it	provided	me with	cost	saving	tips	for	my	business,	along	with	an	interesting video	tutorial	on	the	topic	for	me	to	watch.	This	free	resource	is	the number	one	AI	business	assistant	right	now	and	includes	an extensive	video	library.   	Braina:	With	a	basic	freeware	version	or	professional	edition	priced  at	$29,	the	Braina	assistant	allows	you	to	run	apps,	open	files, navigate	to	websites,	set	up	alarms,	and	create	notes	and reminders.	Learn	more	at	https:  www.brainasoft.com braina   One	interesting	fact	that	many	experts	have	noticed	is	that	nearly	all	of the	AI	assistants	on	the	market	today	have	women’s	first	names.  It’s	very	likely	that	more	advanced	AI	tools	will	soon	be	released	from virtually	all	major	companies,	and	that	we	will	be	using	these	tools throughout	our	daily	lives.	However,	since	this	means	that	more	of	our private	data	will	be	on	the	cloud	and	more	vulnerable	to	hacking,	it	raises important	privacy	and	security	concerns.  	   22.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Changing	Market Research?  Imagine	if	you	could	quickly	and	easily	have	access	to	the	high	caliber	of market	research	that	was	once	afforded	only	to	the	largest	and	wealthiest of	companies	–	those	that	could	outsource	this	task	to	the	best	market research	firms.	Would	you	be	interested?  In	the	past,	the	market	research	process	was	time-consuming,	and	the reliability	of	the	insights	gained	into	the	thoughts	and	decisions	of consumers	were	far	from	perfect.  Now,	free	online	tools	that	use	artificial	intelligence	are	available	from Google	and	Facebook,	including	Google	Trends	and	Facebook	Audience Insights,	making	it	possible	for	any	business	to	take	advantage	of	high- quality,	real-time	information.	These	tools	allow	the	companies	that	use them	to	anticipate	and	prepare	for	trends	within	their	industry,	providing them	with	a	competitive	advantage.  While	only	a	handful	of	companies	are	currently	taking	full	advantage	of these	incredible	resources,	the	growth	of	artificial	intelligence	tools,	such as	IBM’s	Watson,	will	allow	everyone	to	benefit	from	all-encompassing market	research	data	on	nearly	any	industry	faster	than	ever	before.  Using	AI-powered	business	insights	can	help	a	company	react	quickly	to new	trends	in	the	marketplace,	enabling	it	to	become	a	leader	within	its industry,	which	can	make	a	big	difference	to	its	bottom	line.  While	there	are	many	kinds	of	information	that	these	AI	tools	can generate,	here	are	some	of	the	most	impactful	and	important:   	Detailed	Information	on	Your	Competitors:	This	includes	insights  into	their	revenue	streams,	more	successful	products,	personnel, key	competitive	advantages,	challenges	they	face,	and performance	on	social	media.   	Consumer	Insights	and	Predictive	Data:	With	ever-increasing amounts	of	data	available,	AI	tools	will	make	it	easier	to	analyze   signals	from	consumers	and	create	predictive	reports	for	future trends.	For	example,	businesses	can	now	use	Google	Trends	or Facebook	Audience	Insights	to	determine	what	kinds	of	Halloween costumes	consumers	will	be	searching	for	this	season,	but	it	may take	some	time	to	get	the	results	manually.	AI	will	make	this process	faster,	more	efficient,	and	more	effective	by	analyzing consumer	signals	automatically.   	Product	Personalization	Possibilities:	AI	tools	play	an	important  role	as	product	advertising	becomes	more	individualized	and precise	for	product	personalization.	These	resources	can	help companies	to	identify	key	audiences	and	reach	them	more effectively	on	an	individual	level,	by	tailoring	a	user’s	experience	of an	ad	to	factors	like	their	gender,	age,	location,	or	profession.	This is	truly	where	the	future	of	advertising	lies.   	List	of	Top	Consumer	Influencers:	Artificial	intelligence  instruments	can	help	companies	to	recognize	and	then	utilize	the most	effective	channels	for	reaching	a	particular	market.	This	is especially	helpful	on	social	media	platforms	like	YouTube	and Instagram,	where	individuals	can	influence	a	massive	set	of followers	quickly	and	effectively.	Using	the	individuals	who	have	the greatest	reach	into	a	target	audience	to	promote	your	products	or services	through	tailored	reviews	is	known	as	influencer	marketing and	holds	a	lot	of	potential	for	success	when	done	correctly	and authentically.  The	kinds	of	market	research	that	once	took	months	to	generate	can	in the	future	be	completed	in	hours	or	even	minutes,	thanks	to	the incredible	abilities	of	AI	tools.	While	businesses	of	all	sizes	will	likely begin	to	leverage	these	AI-powered	market	research	tools	in	the	future, the	best	opportunities	will	be	available	for	solo	entrepreneurs	who	want	to be	able	to	quickly	launch	new	products	successfully	and	can	use	these resources	to	get	ahead	of	their	competitors.  In	this	section	I	have	purposely	not	named	any	specific	market	research tools	that	can	perform	all	of	the	tasks	mentioned	above,	since	there	are currently	very	few	affordable	ones	that	can	do	so.	However,	for	medium and	large-sized	companies,	IBM’s	Watson	could	be	one	possible	option   and	large-sized	companies,	IBM’s	Watson	could	be	one	possible	option to	start	with.	The	possibilities	in	market	research	are	endless	with	the	aid of	artificial	intelligence.  	   23.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Changing	Sales?  With	the	sheer	number	of	ways	that	consumers	view	advertisements	on	a daily	basis,	both	online	and	offline,	getting	your	brand	message	to actually	reach	your	customers	effectively	has	become	increasingly complicated	over	the	last	few	years.  In	recent	years,	marketers	and	small	to	medium-sized	companies	have started	to	design	customer	purchasing	personas	as	a	way	to	define	what their	ideal	buyer	looks	like.	These	are	typically	developed	from	a	blend	of data	gathered	from	past	clients	and	insights	offered	by	Facebook	and Google	Analytics.	Traditionally,	however,	this	approach	has	also	included a	large	degree	of	guesswork.  Today,	some	companies	have	started	testing	out	the	use	of	AI-powered sales	tools,	and	have	witnessed	staggering	results.	For	example,	Harley Davidson	has	increased	its	sales	leads	by	an	unbelievable	2,930	percent at	its	New	York	store	with	the	use	of	one	such	tool.{74}  The	tool	used	by	Harley	Davidson,	an	AI	interface	called	Albert,	analyzes data	on	existing	customers	by	using	a	CRM	 customer	relationship management 	tool,	which	defines	what	high-value	customers	have	looked like	in	past	transactions,	and	then	compares	this	information	with	other data	points	such	as	analytics	on	website	visitors.  The	Harvard	Business	Review	examined	the	difference	between	the traditional	creation	of	a	buyer	persona	against	the	use	of	AI	tools	in	sales and	had	this	to	say:  “Marketers	have	traditionally	used	buyer	personas	–	broad,	behavior- based	customer	profiles	–	as	guides	to	find	new	ones.	These	personas are	created	partly	out	of	historic	data,	and	partly	by	guesswork,	gut	feel, and	the	marketers’	experiences.	Companies	that	design	their	marketing campaigns	around	personas	tend	to	use	similarly	blunt	tools	 such	as gross	sales 	–	and	more	guesswork	–	to	assess	what’s	worked	and	what hasn’t.   AI	systems	don’t	need	to	create	personas;	they	find	real	customers	in	the wild	by	determining	what	actual	online	behaviors	have	the	highest probability	of	resulting	in	conversions,	and	then	finding	potential	buyers online	who	exhibit	these	behaviors.”{75}  The	example	of	Harley	Davidson,	along	with	other	companies	using similar	resources,	demonstrates	how	sales	will	be	done	in	the	future, using	AI	tools	that	offer	astonishing	results.  Albert	can	be	found	at	https:  albert.ai	and	represents	just	one	of	the many	companies	that	are	developing	new	kinds	of	AI-based	techniques to	improve	the	sales	process.  Inbound	marketing	company	Hubspot	offers	another	tool	that	can	help companies	to	personalize	their	advertising	and	create	predictive	lead scoring,	among	other	features.	More	information	about	the	ways	that Hubspot	is	using	AI	can	be	reviewed	at https:  www.hubspot.com artificial-intelligence  Yet	another	notable	development	in	the	world	of	sales	can	be	seen	in	the partnership	between	Salesforce,	a	leader	in	CRM	solutions	for	the	B2B market,	and	Watson,	one	of	the	most	powerful	AI	tools	on	the	market today,	created	by	IBM.	Using	a	combination	of	traditional	and	AI-based resources	will	likely	create	a	powerful	and	effective	sales	process.  	   24.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Changing	the	Way We	Do	Marketing?  The	development	of	artificial	intelligence	will	drastically	change	the	way companies	market	their	services	and	products	to	consumers.  According	to	a	survey	of	3,500	global	marketing	leaders	conducted	by Salesforce	Research,	51	percent	are	using	or	expect	to	use	artificial intelligence	during	the	period	of	2017	to	2019.	These	results	are highlighted	in	Salesforce’s	fourth	annual	“State	of	Marketing”	report.{76}  The	same	survey	revealed	that	64	percent	of	marketing	leaders	who	use AI	report	that	it	has	substantially	improved	their	overall	marketing efficiency.{77}	It	is	worth	mentioning	that	the	AI	tools	they	have	access	to now	is	nothing	compared	to	those	that	will	be	available	in	the	near	future. Therefore,	I	see	that	percentage	only	increasing	over	time.  The	report	also	lists	the	three	most	challenging	obstacles	faced	by marketing	leaders	in	the	employment	of	AI	strategies.	These	obstacles are:	budgetary	constraints,	privacy	concerns,	and	the	need	to	store	data in	separate	systems.{78}  AI	is	also	starting	to	play	a	more	important	role	in	paid	advertising.	Both Google	and	Facebook	have	already	applied	a	lot	of	AI	features	to	their paid	advertising	platforms.	According	to	a	study	conducted	by	Juniper Research,	“nearly	75	percent	of	all	delivered	digital	ads	will	use	artificial intelligence	as	a	means	of	user	targeting	in	2022.”{79}		This	essentially means	that	the	future	of	paid	advertising	will	be	heavily	dependent	on	AI. Here	are	just	a	few	of	the	ways	that	artificial	intelligence	will	change	the landscape	of	marketing	forever:   	Chatbots:	Small	to	medium-sized	companies	will	begin	to	build  their	marketing	funnels	 or	purchasing	funnels,	which	showcase	a customer’s	journey	toward	the	purchasing	of	a	product	or	service  around	information	derived	from	intelligent	chatbots.	These chatbots	will	be	able	to	provide	product	information	to	customers, which	will	enable	them	to	personalize	the	products	and	services they	purchase.	Soon,	the	information	gathered	from	this	process   will	help	companies	to	create	effective	and	personalized	marketing funnels	and	sales	processes.   	SEO	 Search	Engine	Optimization :	Voice	search	technologies are	growing	rapidly.	As	these	tools	become	increasingly	better	at processing	language	in	a	more	natural	way,	more	users	will	turn	to voice	searches	over	traditional	typed	search	queries.	This	will change	the	way	that	keywords	are	used,	as	people	express themselves	differently	when	communicating	verbally	instead	of	in written	form.   	Predictive	Searches:	One	of	the	goals	of	the	Google	search  engine	is	to	be	able	to	predict	what	kinds	of	searches	you	may want	to	do,	suggesting	results	in	advance.	Thanks	to	machine learning,	the	Google	Assistant	tool,	a	kind	of	bot,	can	observe	what you	search	and	suggest	potential	searches	for	the	future	based	on your	results.   	Intelligent	AI	Tools:	Every	major	tool	for	online	marketers	today applies	some	kind	of	AI	element.	Personally,	I	use	Quill	Engage  www.quillengage.com ,	derived	from	Google	Analytics,	which sends	me	personalized	reports	on	the	performance	of	my	website, explaining	the	results	in	simple	terms	and	providing	suggestions	for improvement.	These	kinds	of	tools	can	help	entrepreneurs	to	save time	and	money.  These	are	just	a	few	of	the	ways	that	AI	technologies	will	change	the	way we	do	marketing,	but	there	are	many	others.	By	my	best	estimates,	all aspects	of	marketing	will	involve	some	form	of	artificial	intelligence	within the	next	few	years,	so	the	first	to	adopt	these	tools	and	use	them	well	will get	ahead.  	   25.	How	Can	You	Improve	Your	Email Communications	with	AI?  Email	marketing	has	been	one	of	the	most	effective	digital	marketing techniques	in	recent	years.	As	AI	technologies	continue	to	grow	and develop,	we	will	see	more	and	more	companies	using	artificial intelligence	to	make	their	email	marketing	even	better.  In	order	for	AI	to	work,	a	large	quantity	of	data	is	usually	needed. Therefore,	most	of	the	first	AI-based	email	marketing	tools	will	probably be	created	for	large	companies.  One	key	area	where	AI	could	improve	email	marketing	is	the	optimization of	results.	For	example,	AI	software	could	analyze	the	elements	of	an email	that	a	company	has	sent	to	prospective	clients	in	the	past.	Then, based	on	that	analysis,	it	could	recommend	improvements	to	elements	of that	email,	such	as	the	subject	line,	call-to-action,	and	content.  The	future	of	effective	email	marketing	will	probably	consist	mainly	of mass	personalization	of	emails	based	on	client	profiles.	This	will	require	a lot	of	data	analysis,	for	which	AI	is	perfect.  Boom	Train	is	a	company	that	uses	AI	to	analyze	a	website’s	user behavior.	It	then	provides	personalized	email	communications	based	on that	analysis.  You	can	find	more	about	the	company	here:	www.boomtrain.com  Google	is	also	integrating	AI	into	all	of	its	products,	including	its	email service,	known	as	Gmail.  Right	now,	Google’s	Smart	Reply	tool	works	on	its	iOS	and	Android mobile	applications.	It	works	by	reviewing	the	messages	you	receive	and providing	three	suggestions	of	short	potential	responses	you	may	want	to send.	Once	you	have	chosen	the	appropriate	prewritten	response,	you can	add	additional	text	to	your	message	or	send	it	immediately	as suggested.	This	is	a	great	timesaving	feature	that	will	probably	start being	used	across	a	variety	of	other	applications	as	well.  Another	helpful	AI	tool	within	your	email	system	is	known	as   Another	helpful	AI	tool	within	your	email	system	is	known	as Respondable.	Made	to	work	with	Google	Gmail,	this	resource	offers	you suggestions	on	ways	to	improve	the	content	of	your	email	message, providing	indicators	such	as	the	subject	of	the	email,	basic	forms	of courtesy,	and	the	length	of	the	text	being	sent.  Figure	3.3.	Boomerang	for	Gmail	at  www.boomeranggmail.com respondable  	  This	email	resource	can	be	found	at http:  www.boomeranggmail.com respondable 	Start	taking	advantage	of Respondable	and	Smart	Reply	now	to	become	familiar	with	the technology,	as	more	advanced	tools	and	features	will	likely	be	available soon.	Whether	you	are	implementing	AI-powered	email	assistants personally	or	for	your	business,	you	can	use	them	to	communicate	more quickly	and	effectively.  	  	   26.	Can	Artificial	Intelligence	Be	Members	of Leadership	Teams?  Artificial	intelligence	technologies	are	starting	to	have	a	seat	at	the	table when	it	comes	to	making	leadership	decisions	within	companies.  At	the	highest	levels	within	a	company,	the	decisions	being	made	are often	complex,	requiring	advanced	analysis	of	data	and	the	ability	to predict	the	effects	a	decision	may	have	on	the	company	on	a	larger scale.	This	is	the	perfect	environment	in	which	AI	tools	can	thrive.  	   Figure	3.4.	Leadership	Team.  	  The	Finnish	company	Tieto	has	already	begun	to	implement	an	AI assistant,	known	as	Alicia,	who	is	considered	to	be	a	full	member	of	the team	and	even	has	voting	rights.{80}  In	a	recent	interview,	Tieto’s	Taneli	Tikka	confirmed	that	Alicia	has reminded	the	company’s	board	members	of	important	data	and	statistics, helping	them	to	make	smarter	business	decisions.{81}		Companies	like   Tieto	exemplify	excellent	use	of	AI-powered	tools	that	will	soon	be commonplace	within	businesses	of	all	sizes,	but	particularly	the	largest ones.  The	kinds	of	tasks	assigned	to	AI	members	of	leadership	teams	will	likely include	analysis	and	recommendations	on	decisions	like	whether	to	enter into	a	new	market,	buy	out	a	competitor,	or	develop	a	new	product.  Already,	AI	assistants	like	IBM’s	Watson	can	bring	together	complex	data from	various	external	sources,	analyze	their	trends	against	a	company’s internal	metrics	and	business	objectives,	and	present	suggestions	to	that company	based	upon	its	findings.  Additionally,	because	of	the	ability	of	these	tools	to	continually	learn	and improve	themselves,	they	will	be	able	to	process	higher	quantities	of	data more	efficiently	and	effectively	over	time,	becoming	increasingly indispensable	partners	to	the	companies	they	serve.  	   27.	Can	Artificial	Intelligence	Be	the	New	Customer Service	Department?  One	of	the	first	business	processes	that	will	likely	experience	dramatic change	through	artificial	intelligence	technologies	is	customer	service.  In	the	next	few	years,	you	will	probably	be	able	to	call	any	large	bank, Internet	service	provider	or	major	company,	and	experience	a	natural, lifelike	conversation	with	an	AI-enhanced	robot	or	chatbot	that	was	built to	respond	in	conversation	or	written	text	like	a	human	would,	but	to	find solutions	to	customer	issues	faster	and	more	efficiently	than	a	traditional customer	service	team	could.  According	to	Gartner,	a	leading	research	company,	“by	2020,	customers will	manage	85%	of	their	relationship	with	the	enterprise	without interacting	with	a	human.”{82}		That	is	quite	a	significant	change	and	will be	largely	possible	thanks	to	the	growth	of	artificial	intelligence technologies.  There	are	two	primary	reasons	why	customer	service	is	likely	to	be affected	greatly	by	AI	technologies.  First,	modern	consumers	expect	businesses	to	provide	incredibly	fast response	times	and	adequate	solutions	to	their	problems.	This	has proven	to	be	a	challenge	for	many	companies	as	they	try	to	meet	the needs	and	demands	of	their	customers	without	hiring	in	large	teams	that are	available	24	hours	a	day,	7	days	a	week.  Secondly,	many	customer	support	activities	are	repetitive	in	nature, drawing	on	particular	sets	of	data	to	resolve	specific	issues,	which	is	well suited	to	an	AI	tool.	While	there	are	some	business	models	that	require more	creativity	and	custom	solutions	for	customer	service	inquiries, which	would	be	too	complicated	for	chatbots	and	AI	resources,	most businesses	will	find	that	AI	tools	are	more	than	adequate	for	their customer	service	needs.  Many	small	to	medium-sized	companies	have	already	started implementing	chatbot	technologies	in	their	business	models,	drawing	on free	or	inexpensive	tools	like	manychat.com	or	chatfuel.com.	These   free	or	inexpensive	tools	like	manychat.com	or	chatfuel.com.	These services	are	easy	to	use	and	do	not	require	advanced	coding	knowledge, which	makes	them	accessible	to	nearly	any	entrepreneur	or	organization seeking	to	improve	their	customer	service	processes.  As	more	companies	become	interested	in	AI-powered	customer	service tools,	there	will	likely	be	a	greater	degree	of	development	invested	back into	these	technologies,	helping	to	refine	and	improve	their	abilities	and responsiveness.	Early	versions	of	customer	service	chatbots	may	not	be perfect,	but	there	have	already	been	rapid	and	powerful	developments	in this	arena.  There	are	tremendous	advantages	for	companies	that	take	advantage	of AI-based	customer	service	tools,	including	decreased	labor	costs,	faster customer	response	times,	and	the	ability	to	personalize	and	scale responses.	We’ll	take	a	more	in-depth	look	at	these	and	other advantages	in	our	upcoming	chapter	on	chatbots.  	   28.	How	Can	You	Save	Time	With	AI-Powered Accounting?  Let’s	face	it…for	most	entrepreneurs	and	business	owners,	accounting	is an	activity	that	not	only	takes	a	lot	of	time	and	energy,	but	also	requires mathematical	skill.	However,	the	very	things	that	make	accounting difficult	and	tedious	for	a	human	are	the	same	factors	that	make accounting	a	perfect	fit	for	AI	technologies.  One	business	that	is	currently	using	AI-powered	accounting	tools	well	is called	Dooer.	This	is	a	Swedish	AI	startup	that	uses	visual	recognition and	artificial	intelligence	to	automate	basic	tasks	of	accounting.	A	recent quote	from	Business	Insider	reveals	how	their	process	works:  	  Figure	3.5.	Dooer	Website	at	www.dooer.com  	  “Some	examples	of	these	tasks	are	taking	photos	of	receipts	and invoices	or	providing	income	and	salary	statements.	These	are	entered into	Dooer’s	platform,	which	is	integrated	with	the	customer’s	bank   account	and	the	Swedish	tax	authorities.	Dooer	then	matches	the customer’s	bank	transactions	with	the	provided	receipts	and	invoices, and	sends	through	a	summary	for	approval	by	month’s	end.”{83}  As	the	technology	continues	to	develop,	there	will	probably	be	other	AI tools	like	this	one	that	will	help	entrepreneurs	do	their	accounting	more quickly	and	easily.	However,	in	larger	companies,	accountants	will probably	continue	to	be	needed	to	handle	the	tasks	that	have	greater degrees	of	complexity.  	   29.	How	is	Artificial	Intelligence	Changing	Human Resources	and	Hiring?  Do	you	want	to	quickly	confirm	your	benefits	or	check	how	many	vacation days	you	have	left	to	use	this	year?	Simply	ask	your	company’s	chatbot to	get	answers	immediately.  Imagine	not	having	to	check	your	company’s	employee	handbook	or	call your	human	resource	 HR 	representative,	instead	being	able	to	rely	on	a highly	intelligent	AI	resource	to	quickly	and	easily	get	answers	to	your basic	HR	questions.  AI	technologies	are	a	perfect	fit	for	many	of	the	daily	activities	of	human resources	employees.	As	more	HR	processes	are	performed	with	AI tools,	labor	costs	for	companies	will	decrease	as	productivity	rises.  One	of	the	leading	companies	at	the	forefront	of	this	kind	of	technology	is Talla,	Inc.	This	business	develops	chatbots	that	are	focused	on	improving the	internal	communications	within	a	company	while	allowing	managers to	quickly	and	easily	create	meeting	announcements	and	send	scheduled messages	to	their	teams.{84}	These	features,	along	with	several	others, make	it	simple	to	improve	a	company’s	efficiency.  As	AI-based	human	resources	tools	improve,	we	will	likely	see	a	greater number	of	large	and	small	businesses	using	chatbots	and	similar	tools	to boost	their	internal	communications.  AI-powered	tools	can	also	be	applied	to	the	hiring	process.	Traditionally, companies	have	had	to	spend	countless	hours	to	find	just	the	right candidate	to	fill	a	position,	searching	through	databases	or	reviewing resumes	to	compare	applicants.	Now,	AI	assistants	can	rapidly	gather detailed	information	about	candidates	from	social	media	and	professional sites	like	LinkedIn,	analyze	their	findings,	and	provide	hiring recommendations	to	managers.  The	value	of	these	tools	extends	far	beyond	the	hiring	process,	however, as	companies	can	also	use	AI-based	resources	to	analyze	the	work performance	of	their	personnel,	examining	information	such	as	how	often a	person	has	been	tardy	or	the	monetary	value	of	contracts	lost	by	a   a	person	has	been	tardy	or	the	monetary	value	of	contracts	lost	by	a particular	employee.	Managers	can	review	this	data	and	use	it	to	make personnel	decisions.	In	the	future,	employees	may	even	be	fired	solely based	on	the	analytical	recommendations	of	this	type	of	AI	software.  Futurist	Gerd	Leonhart,	author	of	the	book	Technology	vs.	Humanity, which	I	highly	recommend	reading,	has	created	the	term	“androrithms”	to suggest	that	there	are	particular	important	human	qualities,	including empathy,	creativity	and	storytelling,	that	cannot	be	directly	measured	by machines.{85}	He	suggests	that	for	this	reason,	even	the	best	AI	tools should	never	be	used	alone	to	make	HR	decisions,	but	rather	should	be used	along	with	careful	consideration	and	input	from	managers.	You	can learn	more	about	androrithms	by	visiting	androrithms.com.  	   30.	Can	Artificial	Intelligence	Be	Your	New	Legal Team?  When	I	first	tested	out	the	AI	chatbot	at	donotpay.co.uk,	now	available	at https:  donotpay-search-master.herokuapp.com	I	was	astounded	by	the speed	at	which	it	was	capable	of	communicating	with	me.  	  Figure	3.6.	Do	Not	Pay	Website	at  https:  donotpay-search-master.herokuapp.com  	  This	remarkable	chatbot,	which	provides	free	and	fast	legal	aid,	can assist	with	a	multitude	of	minor	legal	issues,	such	as	disputing	a	parking ticket.	In	fact,	according	to	an	article	in	The	Guardian,	this	legal	chatbot assistant	has	now	been	able	to	successfully	fight	over	160,000	parking tickets	in	major	cities	like	London	and	New	York	at	no	cost	to	its	users.{86}  In	the	press,	this	chatbot	has	been	given	the	title	of	the	world’s	first chatbot	lawyer,	leading	many	to	predict	that	in	the	future,	tools	like	this will	end	the	need	for	traditional	lawyers.	At	the	same	time,	it	is	important   to	recognize	that	currently,	this	service	is	fairly	limited,	and	cannot perform	many	of	the	tasks	of	a	human	attorney,	such	as	representing	you in	court	or	visiting	you	at	your	place	of	business.{87}  What	is	clear,	however,	is	that	many	of	the	less	complex	legal	tasks currently	performed	by	professional	lawyers	will	soon	be	transferred	to AI-powered	chatbots.  Apart	from	fighting	traffic	tickets,	AI	chatbots	can	also	be	used	to research	patents	and	pull	information	from	legal	databases,	which	will make	them	an	enticing	tool	for	small	to	medium-sized	companies.  While	legal	professionals	will	still	handle	the	larger	or	more	complex tasks,	many	of	these	lawyers	themselves	will	probably	begin	to	utilize	AI- powered	chatbots	to	assist	them	in	their	daily	duties.   CHAPTER	IV  CHATBOTS	AND	HOW	THEY	WILL	CHANGE  COMMUNICATION  	  Figure	4.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	IV.  	   Because	of	their	simplicity	and	usefulness,	chatbots	are	quickly becoming	one	of	the	most	accessible	and	popular	ways	for	companies	to start	using	AI.	Some	types	of	chatbots	can	work	independently	from	AI. However,	I	thought	it	was	important	to	cover	the	topic	thoroughly,	as experts	believe	that	AI-powered	chatbots	will	take	on	a	larger	role	in	our communication	with	companies	in	the	future.	This	chapter	will	address the	different	ways	that	chatbots	can	be	used	to	improve	communication between	companies	and	their	customers.	It	will	also	cover	some	of	the other	advantages,	as	well	as	some	disadvantages,	of	chatbots.  While	chatbots	are	still	in	the	early	stages	of	being	adopted	by companies,	I	believe	it	is	worth	taking	the	time	to	learn	about	chatbot technologies,	as	many	companies	are	leaning	in	this	direction	as	a solution	for	customer	service	needs	in	the	future.  	   31.	What	Are	Chatbots	and	Why	Do	They	Matter?  In	essence,	chatbots	are	computer	programs	that	conduct	conversations through	text	or	audio.	These	are	becoming	more	commonplace,	so	it	is important	to	understand	how	they	work	and	how	you	can	benefit	from them.  Eduardo	Manchón,	a	Spanish	tech	entrepreneur	and	founder	of Panoramio	 a	service	sold	to	Google	in	2007 ,	believes	that	consumers will	primarily	communicate	with	companies	through	chatbots	in	the	future, as	it	is	a	more	natural	process	for	starting	a	conversation	than	filling	out forms	on	a	website.	For	this	reason,	he	predicts	that	chatbots	will	be more	popular	than	websites	or	mobile	apps.{88}  Personally,	I	foresee	this	happening	someday	as	well,	especially	when the	technologies	develop	to	the	point	where	chatbots	are	able	to	operate with	voice-based	input.  Similarly,	Stan	Chudnovsky,	vice	president	of	Facebook	Messenger, believes	that	in	the	future	people	will	seek	to	communicate	with businesses	more	often	through	messaging	platforms,	preferring	a	quick and	easy	conversational	experience	to	a	long	wait	on	the	phone.  According	to	Chudnovsky,	over	100,000	developers	are	currently	building chatbots	for	the	Facebook	Messenger	platform.	This	lends	some credibility	to	the	theory	that	the	best	form	of	advertising	in	the	future	will come	from	a	blend	of	human	and	chatbot	services.{89}	In	this	scenario, humans	could	take	over	the	conversation	when	questions	or	problems cannot	be	answered	or	solved	by	the	chatbot.	At	the	moment,	these kinds	of	blended	chatbot	models	seem	to	offer	the	best	results.  There	are	two	basic	kinds	of	chatbot	technologies.	The	first	operates under	simple,	predefined	rules,	while	the	second	runs	with	artificial intelligence.	One	of	the	primary	benefits	of	using	chatbots	is	that	they	can increase	the	speed	of	communication	while	offering	responses	24 7.  There	are	a	variety	of	ways	that	chatbots	can	be	used,	such	as	ordering a	pizza,	reviewing	travel	arrangements,	asking	for	product	information	or receiving	beauty	tips.   receiving	beauty	tips.  As	the	technology	grows	and	evolves,	chatbots	will	be	implemented	in new	and	innovative	ways.	Here	are	just	a	few	surprising	statistics	about the	rise	of	chatbot	tools:   	47	percent	of	consumers	say	that	they	would	be	open	to	purchasing  items	through	a	chatbot.	37	percent	would	buy	items	from Facebook.{90}	67	percent	of	consumers	have	interacted	with	a chatbot	for	customer	support	within	the	past	year.{91}   	On	an	Adidas	chatbot,	over	2,000	people	signed	up	to	participate  within	the	first	two	weeks	after	launch,	with	repeated	use	at	80 percent.	After	the	first	week,	retention	was	at	60	percent,	which	the brand	claims	is	much	better	than	could	have	been	accomplished with	an	app.{92}   	80	percent	of	businesses	say	that	they	want	to	offer	chatbots	by	the  year	2020.{93}  One	major	factor	paving	the	way	for	the	growth	of	chatbot	usage	is	the mobile	app	ecosystem,	which	is	becoming	increasingly	crowded,	making it	more	difficult	for	people	to	get	their	voices	heard.	Although	the	mobile app	market	may	be	oversaturated,	most	smartphone	owners	only	actually use	a	few	mobile	apps	on	a	daily	basis.	This	creates	a	perfect environment	for	chatbots	to	really	catch	on.	Chatbots	are	still	relatively new	and	have	that	novelty	factor,	making	them	an	intriguing	option	for people	who	are	looking	to	try	something	different.  Over	time,	chatbots	will	become	better	at	matching	human	conversation, allowing	a	larger	portion	of	customer	interactions	and	internal	company communications	to	occur	through	chatbots.  	   32.	What	Are	the	Different	Tools	and	Platforms	for Chatbots?  You	might	be	wondering	which	are	the	main	chatbot	companies	and which	tools	could	help	you	to	get	started.	There	are	actually	a	huge variety	of	tools	currently	available,	with	more	being	created	each	day	as chatbots	are	become	increasingly	important	for	companies.  In	Figure	4.2,	you	will	see	some	well-known	companies	and	tools	in	the chatbot	landscape.   	Instant	Messaging	Platforms:	These	are	platforms	where	your  customers	or	clients	would	use	the	chatbot.	For	example,	for	most B2C	 business-to-consumer 	companies,	Facebook	Messenger would	be	the	main	choice,	whereas	many	B2B	 business-to- business 	companies	could	build	their	chatbots	for	Slack,	an	instant messaging	tool	frequently	used	by	B2B	companies.   	Chatbot	Builder	Tools:	These	are	different	tools	that	can	be	used to	help	you	build	your	own	chatbot.	Probably	the	most	well-known options	for	small	and	medium	companies	are	Chatfuel	and Manychat.	I	personally	recommend	Chatfuel,	which	is	also	used	by many	large	and	well-known	companies.   	AI	Tools:	These	are	chatbot	building	tools	that	allow	for	AI-based  features	like	natural	language	processing	 NLP 	or	even	voice- enabled	chatbots.	IBM’s	Watson,	Amazon	Lex,	Microsoft	Azure, and	Google’s	Dialogflow	are	the	most	recognized	providers	in	this category.   	Smart	Personal	Assistants:	These	are	personal	assistants	like  Google	Assistant,	Amazon’s	Alexa,	Microsoft’s	Cortana	and Apple’s	Siri.	Out	of	these,	Amazon’s	Alexa	is	the	one	where	most companies	have	built	their	voice-enabled	chatbots,	although	this has	been	done	primarily	by	big	companies.	However,	it	is	possible that	in	the	future,	most	small	companies	will	also	be	able	to	have their	chatbots	integrated	with	these	smart	personal	assistants	as well.   	  Figure	4.2.	Chatbot	Landscape.  	   33.	What	Are	the	Greatest	Benefits	Offered	by Chatbots?  When	a	company	develops	and	implements	a	chatbot,	it	is	usually seeking	to	automate	at	least	some	portion	of	communication	with	its clients	or	customers.	For	example,	up	to	80	percent	of	customer	inquiries regarding	particular	products	are	repetitive	questions	rather	than	unique communications.	For	this	reason,	creating	a	chatbot	that	can	share	basic product	information	makes	sense,	as	customers	can	receive	instant, effective	responses	at	any	time	of	the	day	or	night.  There	are	many	different	advantages	to	using	chatbot	tools.	These	not only	apply	to	businesses,	but	also	to	various	other	kinds	of	organizations. Here	are	some	of	the	top	benefits	afforded	by	chatbot	technologies:   	Instantaneous	Communication:	Waiting	on	hold	to	talk	to  customer	support	is	one	of	the	worst	aspects	of	trying	to communicate	with	a	company	traditionally.	Chatbots	offer immediate	responses	to	basic	customer	needs.   	Decreased	Costs	of	Operation:	After	the	chatbot	itself	is  developed,	there	are	often	little	to	no	costs	associated	with	the	use of	the	tool,	as	opposed	to	paying	hourly	rates	and	benefits	to human	customer	service	workers.	In	an	upcoming	section,	I’ll	share a	free	and	effective	way	to	make	chatbots.   	Ease	of	Access:	There	is	no	need	to	download	special	software	to  communicate	with	a	chatbot,	as	most	chatbot	tools	can	work	on popular	services	like	Facebook	Messenger,	Slack,	Telegram,	Kik, or	even	websites.	This	also	means	that	companies	can	reach	large audiences	with	simple	chatbots.   	Time	Savings:	In	addition	to	the	cost	benefits	mentioned	above, companies	can	also	decrease	the	amount	of	time	they	spend	on communication	tasks	by	using	chatbots.   	Mobile	Services:	For	most	businesses	and	organizations,	it	is  more	efficient	and	cost-effective	to	develop	a	chatbot	than	a	mobile   app.	While	user	retention	on	apps	tends	to	be	low,	it	is	much	higher on	chatbots.   	High	Volume	Communication:	It	is	much	easier	to	communicate or	offer	services	to	a	large	audience	in	a	short	period	of	time	using a	chatbot	than	with	the	traditional	methods	of	conversation	afforded by	a	call	center	or	customer	service	group.   	Improved	Personalization	Over	Time:	When	chatbots	employ	AI  and	machine	learning,	they	can	remember	what	a	user	asked	in prior	communications,	and	personalize	the	current	conversation based	on	information	from	all	previous	ones.	This	provides	a	much better	user	experience	and	higher	degree	of	customer	satisfaction, while	offering	more	effective	communication	patterns	than	human operators	would	be	able	to	provide.   	Increased	Open	Rates:	When	a	bot	interacts	with	a	user,	it	can  send	various	types	of	notifications.	These	messages	tend	to	bring high	“open”	rates,	usually	between	85-90	percent.	This	is	incredible when	compared	to	traditional	email	communications,	which	are opened	only	about	25-30	percent	of	the	time.  In	marketing,	an	additional	benefit	offered	by	chatbots	is	the	ability	to receive	data	and	analytics	on	your	potential	customers,	which	can	then be	used	to	improve	your	marketing	efforts	and	increase	sales.  There	are	also	a	few	drawbacks	to	implementing	chatbots,	especially when	an	organization	doesn’t	plan	responses	effectively.	Poorly	made chatbots	can	lead	to	frustrated	customers	and	users.	However, companies	that	carefully	and	intentionally	craft	custom	chatbots	can experience	a	competitive	edge,	in	addition	to	the	numerous	benefits offered	by	this	technology.  Main	Benefits	of	Workplace	Chatbots  Most	people	who	follow	trends	in	digital	marketing	are	familiar	with	the explosion	of	growth	in	chatbots,	particularly	those	used	for	the	purposes of	improving	the	marketing	or	customer	service	processes	of	a	business. In	many	cases,	these	chatbots	have	been	developed	for	use	with Facebook	Messenger.   Facebook	Messenger.  However,	many	people	don’t	realize	that	chatbots	can	also	be	used	for internal	communications	within	a	company.	They	can	be	particularly beneficial	for	large	companies,	offering	greater	efficiency	and	improved communication	between	staff	members.  The	larger	an	organization	grows,	the	more	it	can	benefit	from	having	a chatbot.	This	is	because	large	businesses	usually	handle	higher quantities	of	data,	and	have	more	complex	operations	and	rules	in	place than	smaller	businesses.  	  Figure	4.3.	Chatbot	Communication.  	  Here	are	just	a	few	of	the	ways	that	workplace	chatbots	can	assist	large companies:   	Faster	Receipt	of	Information:	Instead	of	spending	hours  searching	for	a	supplier	that	will	meet	your	company’s	needs,   chatbots	can	help	you	find	the	best	option	in	a	matter	of	seconds, while	answering	your	questions	along	the	way.{94}   	Better	Training	Opportunities	for	Employees:	Having	a	chatbot  can	decrease	the	time	needed	to	train	each	new	employee	who joins	an	organization.	Also,	companies	that	create	a	basic	logic tree-based	chatbot	can	offer	their	employees	better	access	to	all	of their	internal	information	because	this	type	of	chatbot	can	be designed	around	all	the	data	that	exists	within	the	intranet	of	an organization.   	Improved	Communication	with	Human	Resources:	Planning	a  vacation	in	the	next	two	months?	Chatbots	can	easily	calculate	how many	vacation	days	you	have	left	and	whether	there	are	any scheduling	conflicts	with	your	coworkers.{95}   	Increased	Motivation	for	Your	Staff:	Using	chatbots,	you	can	very  quickly	and	easily	send	positive,	uplifting	notes	to	your	staff members,	congratulating	them	on	reaching	milestones	or	simply recognizing	their	accomplishments.   	More	Rapid	Communication:	Traditionally,	important	news	is usually	communicated	within	an	organization	over	email	or	an internal	intranet.	However,	a	chatbot	can	share	new	information with	all	members	more	quickly,	which	can	be	helpful	in	sudden	or complicated	situations	such	as	mergers	and	acquisitions.  These	are	just	a	few	of	the	advantages	that	chatbots	can	offer	to	big companies	and	the	list	will	likely	grow	as	the	technologies	continue	to improve.  	   34.	What	Are	the	Primary	Challenges	for	Chatbots?  Businesses	using	chatbots	to	communicate	with	customers	is	a	fairly recent	concept.	These	simple	tools	will	help	to	improve	communication between	organizations	and	the	people	they	serve,	especially	as	they continue	to	be	developed	in	the	future.  Currently,	chatbot	technology	is	still	in	an	early	stage.	As	with	most	new technologies,	there	are	often	obstacles	to	overcome	along	the	way. However,	I’m	certain	that	within	the	next	few	years	we’ll	be	interacting with	chatbots	in	various	ways	throughout	the	day,	experiencing	the numerous	benefits	they	provide.  As	you	plan	out	the	initial	design	for	your	own	chatbot,	you	may	want	to consider	some	of	the	most	common	challenges	experienced	by developers	working	in	this	space	today:   	Lack	of	High	Quality	Examples	of	Chatbots:	If	you	were	looking to	create	a	website,	you	could	easily	jump	onto	Google	or	YouTube and	find	a	number	of	tutorials	and	best	practices	to	help	you	along the	way.	However,	because	chatbot	technology	is	fairly	new,	it	can be	hard	to	find	good	information	on	the	design	process	and potential	pitfalls	to	be	avoided.   	Lack	of	Ability	to	Answer	Complex	Questions:	When	a	person  interacts	with	a	chatbot,	they	can	get	easily	frustrated	if	their questions	are	not	answered	quickly	or	appropriately.  Some	of	the	most	commonly	used	chatbots	today	are	built	with	the logic	of	a	decision	tree,	working	with	information	from	a	large database	and	providing	great	resources	when	you	choose	from	the options	provided.	One	example	of	this	would	be	the	recipe supermarket	chatbot	from	Whole	Foods.  However,	if	you	enter	in	a	more	complicated	request	or	question, these	chatbots	may	not	understand	some	of	the	phrases	you	use or	may	not	return	the	right	information.	As	natural	language processing	 NLP 	and	artificial	intelligence	tools	continue	to improve	in	the	future,	the	responsiveness	of	chatbots	will	as	well.   improve	in	the	future,	the	responsiveness	of	chatbots	will	as	well.  	Lack	of	Empathy	and	Conversational	Quality:	Most	people	who  interact	with	a	chatbot	want	to	be	able	to	have	a	meaningful conversation,	similar	to	one	they	might	have	with	a	human customer	service	representative.	This	means	that	chatbots	need	to be	able	to	recognize	and	respond	appropriately	to	human emotions,	showing	empathy	and	other	social	skills.	While	chatbots may	be	better	able	to	achieve	this	in	the	future,	their	conversational abilities	today	tend	to	be	rather	boring	and	lifeless.   	Lack	of	Voice	Recognition	and	Advanced	Features:	Currently, most	chatbots	don’t	work	well	with	voice	recognition,	although	they may	be	better	equipped	for	this	in	the	future.	The	addition	of	voice recognition	and	other	advanced	features	will	help	to	increase	the desirability	and	popularity	of	chatbots.   	Lack	of	Quality	Artificial	Intelligence:	Many	chatbots	in	use	today must	be	preprogrammed	and	only	offer	a	limited	degree	of	artificial intelligence.	Machine	learning	will	greatly	expand	the	capabilities	of chatbots.	For	example,	if	you	were	to	search	for	flight	tickets	for	an upcoming	trip,	a	chatbot	with	good	AI	could	alert	you	as	more economical	ticket	deals	became	available.{96}  Because	chatbots	can	become	overcomplicated,	it	is	a	good	idea	to design	a	very	simple	chatbot	when	you	are	first	starting	out,	while keeping	in	mind	the	challenges	listed	above.  	   35.	What	Are	Some	Common	Elements	of	Chatbots?  Before	venturing	into	plans	to	create	your	own	chatbot,	it’s	a	good	idea	to set	aside	some	time	to	work	with	a	few	of	the	most	common	kinds	of chatbots.	This	can	help	you	to	understand	how	they	work,	and	learn some	best	practices,	which	will	help	you	to	build	the	best	possible chatbot	service	later.  To	begin	your	analysis,	look	for	three	to	five	chatbots	and	observe	the following	elements	about	them:   	Is	it	easy	to	understand	their	purpose	and	how	to	use	them?   	Are	their	responses	clear	and	helpful?   	What	features	do	you	especially	like	about	them?   	What	do	you	find	confusing	or	difficult	to	understand?  Write	down	your	answers	to	these	questions	and	analyze	which	aspects of	the	chatbots	you	consider	to	be	the	most	positive	and	negative.	This will	help	you	to	identify	which	elements	you	may	want	to	implement,	as well	as	specific	mistakes	to	avoid	making,	when	creating	your	own chatbot.  Two	great	resources	you	can	use	to	help	you	find	chatbots	are https:  botlist.co	and	https:  chatfuel.com bots	 which	features	chatbots created	with	Chatfuel .  There	are	a	number	of	well-designed	chatbots	out	there	that	you	can analyze.	For	example,	Marriott	International,	Inc.,	a	large	hotel	and	resort chain,	is	currently	putting	many	resources	into	the	development	of	useful chatbots	for	its	guests.	One	such	chatbot	can	be	found	at m.me marriottrewards.	I	particularly	enjoy	the	introduction	video	to	this chatbot,	which	clearly	highlights	the	different	ways	the	service	can	be used.  Another	interesting	chatbot	worth	taking	a	look	at	is	GrowthBot.	Created by	HubSpot,	it	was	designed	to	serve	sales	and	marketing	professionals,   and	provides	a	lot	of	helpful	information	pertaining	to	that	industry.	For example,	you	can	ask	GrowthBot	for	a	list	of	the	topics	that	are	currently trending	on	Twitter,	the	main	Google	keyword	search	rankings	for	any company,	or	what	software	is	used	to	run	a	particular	website.	You	can try	out	this	chatbot	for	yourself	at	https:  m.me growthbot.  Developing	Your	Chatbot  As	you	start	planning	the	development	of	your	first	chatbot,	try	to	identify the	key	elements	that	you	want	to	include.	Here	are	some	basic examples	of	factors	you	should	take	into	consideration:   	Type	of	Chatbot:	Are	you	looking	to	create	a	rule-based	chatbot, or	a	more	complex	one	that	offers	AI-powered	elements	such	as natural	language	processing?	In	most	cases,	I’d	recommend starting	with	a	rule-based	chatbot	designed	to	provide	basic information.   	Communication	Style:	Depending	on	your	company’s	needs,	you  may	want	to	customize	your	chatbot’s	conversational	tone	to	be either	on	the	friendlier	side	or	a	little	more	serious.	Generally,	it’s	a good	idea	to	keep	conversational	responses	friendly	and	light.   	Use	of	Emojis:	When	studying	other	chatbots,	take	notice	of	the  kinds	of	Emojis	they	use	in	conversation.	When	used	properly, Emojis	tend	to	improve	the	effectiveness	of	textual	communication. Because	they	add	emotional	cues,	Emojis	can	make communication	feel	more	humanlike,	which	helps	to	build	the	user’s trust.   	Content:	What	kinds	of	content	will	you	curate	for	your	chatbot? For	example,	you	can	offer	videos,	PDFs	or	audio	files	to	users through	your	chatbot	service,	so	carefully	consider	which	forms	of media	will	best	communicate	to	your	target	audience.	For	an	even more	effective	user	experience,	and	to	encourage	engagement,	I recommend	creating	exclusive	content	for	the	chatbot.   	Facebook	Messenger	Chatbots:	One	of	the	primary	benefits	of  building	a	chatbot	on	the	Facebook	Messenger	platform	is	the   ability	to	have	ongoing	broadcasts,	which	allows	you	to	be	in	more frequent	communication	with	your	subscribers.	If	you	choose	this option,	always	plan	your	content	out	in	advance.	Also,	avoid sending	out	too	many	messages	within	a	short	period	of	time. Otherwise,	your	subscribers	might	feel	as	if	they	are	being bombarded	with	messages	or	receiving	spam.  Example	of	a	Chatbot  One	simple	example	of	a	high	quality	chatbot	comes	from	Whole	Foods, which	is	an	American	supermarket	chain	now	owned	by	Amazon.	It	is hosted	on	the	Facebook	Messenger	platform.  To	find	the	Whole	Foods	chatbot,	visit: www.messenger.com t wholefoods  As	with	all	chatbots	on	Facebook	Messenger,	to	begin,	you’ll	want	to	look for	the	button	near	the	top	that	says,	“Get	Started”	and	click	on	it.  1.	Welcome	Message:	In	this	area,	you	can	greet	the	user	and	give	an overview	of	the	kinds	of	information	the	bot	provides.	It’s	best	to	keep	this content	short	and	simple.	Notice	how	Whole	Foods	also	offers	a	quick sentence	about	how	to	start	over,	if	needed.	From	here,	the	user	clicks on	“Got	It.”  	   Figure	4.4.	Chatbot	of	Whole	Foods	–	Welcome	Message.  	  2.	Main	Menu	Items:	This	section	is	a	place	to	provide	various	options and	a	picture,	if	desired.	It	is	usually	a	good	idea	to	limit	your	menu	items to	three	options,	if	possible,	so	that	your	menu	does	not	become	overly complicated.	Try	to	consider	the	things	that	your	ideal	clients	would	most likely	want	to	find.  In	the	example	provided,	the	options	for	the	Whole	Foods	chatbot include:   	Search	for	recipes   	Browse	recipes   	Find	a	store  Here,	I’ve	selected	the	option	to	“Browse	recipes”.  	   Figure	4.5.	Chatbot	of	Whole	Foods	–	Menu.  	  3.	Dive	Deeper	Into	the	Options	Available:	After	I’ve	selected	“Browse recipes”,	the	chatbot	then	offers	me	three	more	options	to	choose	from, which	include	type	of	dish,	cuisine,	and	special	diets,	in	addition	to	an option	to	go	a	step	back	in	the	menu.  I	select	“Type	of	Dish.”  4.	Ask	More	Specific	Questions:	Based	on	the	answer	I	chose	above, the	chatbot	follows	up	by	asking	which	part	of	the	meal	I’m	planning,	so that	it	can	customize	the	information	that	it	presents	appropriately.  I	select	“Apps,	soups	&	salad.”  	   Figure	4.6.	Chatbot	of	Whole	Foods	–	Giving	Options.  The	chatbot	responds	with	a	pleasant	message	and	allows	me	to	be even	more	specific	in	my	request,	checking	to	see	whether	I	am	looking for	appetizers,	salads,	or	soups	and	stews,	while	again	providing	a	way to	step	back	one	level	in	the	menu.  Figure	4.7.	Chatbot	of	Whole	Foods	–	Giving	More	Recipe	Options.  I	select	“Salads.” 5.	Information	is	Presented:	Based	on	the	options	I	selected	above,	the chatbot	provides	several	recipes,	which	I	can	navigate	easily	with	the directional	arrows.  	  	  	  	   Figure	4.8.	Chatbot	of	Whole	Foods	–	Different	Recipe	Options.  	  As	I	select	the	option	to	“View	recipe,”	I	am	directed	back	to	the	Whole Foods	website,	where	I	can	view	the	recipe	in	its	entirety.  By	navigating	through	the	Whole	Foods	chatbot,	you	can	not	only	see how	the	bot	is	created	to	work,	but	also	enjoy	a	more	engaging experience	than	you	might	through	a	traditional	web	search	on	the company	website.	You	may	not	need	quite	as	many	steps	for	your clients,	depending	on	what	kinds	of	things	you	will	be	offering,	but	it	is	a good	idea	to	include	relational,	conversational	responses	along	with	your menu	options.  In	this	instance,	as	well	as	in	many	other	chatbots	for	large	companies, the	bot	message	structure	looks	something	like	this:   	Welcome	message   For	smaller	companies	or	consultant	services,	you	might	consider	using	a slightly	different	structure,	illustrated	below:   	Three	options	provided   	Specify	the	search   	Offer	results   	Welcome	message   	Three	options  ○	Join	our	course  ○	Contact	us  ○	Get	information	about	our	products  I	would	recommend	taking	some	time	now	to	test	and	review	a	number	of different	chatbots,	not	only	from	large	companies,	but	also	from	some	of the	smaller	ones.  	   36.	What	Are	Some	of	the	Most	Common	Enterprise Chatbot	Providers?  Although	small	to	medium-sized	businesses	may	be	more	comfortable using	simple	and	basic	chatbot	providers,	some	of	the	larger	B2B  business-to-business 	organizations	may	want	to	choose	a	more	robust and	well-known	technology	company	to	partner	with	as	they	build chatbots	for	their	customers	or	staff.  Below	are	some	of	the	top	companies	that	currently	provide	chatbot services,	each	of	which	does	require	some	basic	technical	knowledge	to use.   	IBM’s	Watson:	IBM	created	the	technology	used	to	power	Watson,  and	now	offers	a	tool	which,	through	the	use	of	Watson	services, assists	you	in	creating	your	own	conversational	chatbot,	known	as a	cognitive	chatbot.	This	tool	includes	features	called	Watson	Tone Analyzer	and	Watson	Conversation,	both	of	which	allow	for	better interpretation	of	conversational	cues,	helping	users	to	design	more powerful	features	and	applications	than	are	possible	with	basic chatbots.	This	product	is	currently	employed	by	several	large companies	in	the	U.S.,	including	1-800-Flowers,	major	retailer Macy’s,	and	office	supply	chain	Staples. https:  www.ibm.com cloud-computing bluemix watson cognitive- chat-solution  To	begin	creating	a	chatbot	with	the	help	of	IBM’s	Watson,	I recommend	reviewing	the	detailed,	step-by-step	tutorial	entitled Build	a	Chatbot	in	Ten	Minutes	with	Watson. www.ibm.com blogs watson 2016 12 build-chat-bot   	Amazon	Lex:	This	chatbot	building	tool	is	available	through  Amazon	Web	Services	 AWS ,	which	has	been	used	for	years	as	a website	hosting	service.	Amazon	Lex	enables	users	to	employ automatic	speech	recognition	 ASR 	and	natural	language understanding	 NLU ,	the	same	deep	learning	technologies	behind Alexa,	the	intelligent	personal	assistant	developed	by	Amazon.	For   help	in	starting	to	use	Amazon	Lex,	you	can	review	this	guide: https:  aws.amazon.com lex getting-started   	Microsoft	Bot	Framework:	Microsoft	is	also	investing	heavily	in  chatbots,	partnering	with	other	companies	to	develop	stronger chatbot	technologies.	Through	Microsoft	Bot	Framework,	users	can create	their	own	powerful	AI	chatbots	that	can	be	hosted	in	a variety	of	platforms,	including	Skype,	a	telecommunications software	product	that	is	also	owned	by	Microsoft.	You	can	review	a list	of	the	chatbots	developed	through	the	Microsoft	Bot	Framework here:	tps:  bots.botframework.com  You	can	also	view	guides	on	how	to	get	started	using	the	tool	for yourself	here:	https:  dev.botframework.com  All	of	these	resources	require	some	degree	of	technical	knowledge	and are	somewhat	more	complex	to	use	than	basic	chatbot	providers,	but	in return	they	are	able	to	offer	greater	benefits	and	features,	including image	and	speech	recognition.  	   37.	What	Are	Some	of	the	Most	Valuable	Expert	Tips on	Chatbots?  Lior	Romanowsky,	founder	&	CEO	of	Spartans	AI	Innovation,	has	a	lot	of experience	creating	and	implementing	chatbots	for	companies	in	different industries.	Spartans	also	happens	to	be	the	company	that	made	my chatbot,	where	you	can	find	additional	information	related	to	this	book and	which	can	be	found	at:	m.me lassevideo.  In	the	short	interview	below,	Romanowsky	shares	some	of	the	key mistakes	companies	make	when	creating	chatbots,	as	well	as	why	he recommends	using	Chatfuel	for	anyone	who	is	interested	in	getting started	in	chatbot	design.  Why	do	you	think	chatbots	are	becoming	so	important	and	the	use of	chatbots	is	growing	so	fast?  “Chatbots	have	been	around	since	the	age	of	mIRC,	but	today	they	are finally	blossoming	for	several	reasons.	First,	messaging	applications	are becoming	increasingly	popular	and	they	are	a	rapidly	growing	segment	of the	social	world.	We	see	applications	like	Whatsapp,	Messenger,	Viber and	others	reach	billions	of	active	users,	and	people	use	them	to communicate	with	each	other	on	a	daily	basis.	Following	the	example	of the	Asian	markets	and	WeChat,	Facebook	and	other	leading	social	apps have	started	opening	up	their	developing	platforms	to	chatbots.	This allows	businesses	and	brands	to	offer	a	more	efficient	and	convenient	 in most	cases 	way	to	interact.	I	definitely	see	chatbots,	both	textual	and vocal,	taking	on	a	much	more	significant	role	in	our	lives	over	the	next	ten years.	They	will	be	all	around	us,	from	our	refrigerator	chatbots	to	our cars	that	will	be	asking	us	where	to	go	next.”  What	are	the	biggest	mistakes	companies	normally	make	with chatbots?  “One	of	the	biggest	mistakes	companies	are	making	in	the	world	of chatbots	is	trying	to	recreate	interfaces	from	the	world	of	mobile	or	web. Chatbots	are	quite	different	and	the	user	experience	should	be	designed differently.	There’s	no	point	in	recreating	something	that	users	already   love	using	on	other	interfaces.	With	chatbots	what	works	best	is	bringing automated	insights,	updates	and	offerings	and	not	just	plain	information like	what	is	so	often	presented	on	the	company	websites.  Another	common	mistake	is	the	lack	of	clear	guidance	in	chatbots.	The chatbot	entity	should	guide	the	user	to	the	most	relevant	option	or solution	for	his	or	her	needs	and	not	just	wait	for	him	to	ask.	A	lot	of	large companies	have	invested	time	and	effort	into	developing	AI-powered chatbots	that	work	with	natural	language	processing	 NLP 	capabilities which	have	failed.	People	still	prefer	to	press	stuff	and	not	just	make	up questions	about	what	they	need.	When	designing	the	chatbots	we	need to	anticipate	the	users’	needs	correctly.”  What	are	the	advantages	of	Chatfuel	over	other	chatbot	creation tools?  “Chatfuel	is	a	real	market	leader	in	the	world	of	chatbot	builders.	It	allows a	wide	spectrum	of	users	 novice	and	advanced	users 	to	easily	create simple	chatbots	with	very	good	integration	capabilities	and	without coding.	Another	useful	tool	called	Chatflow	allows	for	short implementation	time	and	validation	of	ideas,	and	is	easy	to	use,	even	for non-technical	people.	It's	easy	to	use,	free	for	the	most	part,	and	a	very good	starting	point	for	anyone	that	wants	to	experience	chatbot development.  Solutions	like	Watson,	Lex,	Wit	and	DialogFlow	are	definitely	services that	are	less	accessible	and	clear	to	users	without	the	proper	chatbot coding	skills.	Those	services	bring	a	lot	of	added	value	in	terms	of	AI- powered	natural	language	processing	 NLP 	capabilities	 that	Chatfuel lacks 	and	are	basically	complementary	to	Chatfuel.	Nowadays,	in addition	to	Chatfuel,	we	mainly	use	DialogFlow,	Wit.ai	and	Rasa	 which	is a	server-side	solution 	to	add	NLP	capabilities	to	our	custom-made platforms	and	projects.”  You	can	find	more	information	about	Lior	Romanowsky	and	Spartans	AI at:	www.spartans.tech  	   38.	How	Can	You	Promote	Your	Chatbot?  Once	you’ve	created	a	chatbot,	the	next	priority	is	to	make	sure	that users	can	easily	find	and	engage	with	it.	Because	chatbots	are	still relatively	new	and	offer	a	novel	experience,	users	might	be	more interested	in	using	your	chatbot	than	they	would	be	in	subscribing	to	your email	list.  There	are	a	number	of	ways	that	you	can	entice	users	to	try	out	your chatbot.	Here	are	just	a	few	ways	you	can	promote	your	chatbot	if	it	runs through	Facebook	Messenger:   	Facebook	Ads:	In	the	past	few	years,	the	use	of	Facebook	ads	has  become	one	of	the	most	effective	ways	to	promote	online	content. Although	the	marketing	space	on	Facebook	is	considerably	more crowded	now,	ads	that	specifically	promote	Facebook	Messenger bots	are	not	all	that	common,	so	they	can	be	an	effective	tool	to	set your	chatbot	apart.	You	can	use	these	ads	to	highlight	the	added value	users	can	experience	by	joining	your	chatbot	service.   	M.Me	Links:	These	are	shortened	links	that	can	direct	people  straight	to	your	chatbot	while	being	shared	easily	through	a	variety of	mediums,	including	your	website,	YouTube	videos,	email newsletters,	instant	messaging	services,	and	more.   	Facebook	Page:	Make	sure	to	market	your	chatbot	on	your  Facebook	page	as	well,	so	that	visitors	and	fans	can	easily	access and	use	your	chatbot	directly	through	your	page.   	Search:	Users	can	also	find	your	chatbot	by	searching	for	it	on  Facebook	Messenger.	While	this	method	can	help	you	get	a	few new	users,	people	tend	to	rely	more	heavily	on	Google	searches	to find	content,	as	Google.com	is	so	well-known	as	a	reliable	search engine.   	Discover	Tab:	This	is	a	relatively	new	feature	to	the	Messenger  mobile	app,	where	users	can	go	to	find	new	bots	to	try.	In	order	to have	your	chatbot	appear	in	Discover	Tab,	you’ll	need	to	submit	it   here:	https:  developers.facebook.com docs messenger- platform discovery discover-tab   	Web	Plugins:	It	is	fairly	easy	to	set	up	plugins	on	your	website	that  allow	visitors	to	engage	with	your	chatbot	directly	from	the	site.   	Sharing:	Facebook	also	allows	chatbot	users	to	share	the	content they	discover	with	others.	Increase	your	rate	of	sharing	by	curating interesting	chatbot	content	and	implementing	a	share	button	to make	it	easy	for	users	to	pass	it	along	to	their	friends.   	Messenger	Codes:	This	is	a	trendy	new	code	system	that	is generally	not	yet	well-known	among	the	general	public.	This system	basically	provides	users	with	codes,	through	their	Facebook pages	or	smartphones,	that	allow	them	to	easily	access	your chatbot.	These	codes	could	work	particularly	well	for	local businesses,	as	they	could	be	placed	in	a	store	window,	allowing people	who	walk	by	to	quickly	and	easily	scan	the	code	to	join	the chatbot	service.  	   Figure	4.9.	Techniques	to	Promote	Facebook	Chatbots.  	  To	truly	maximize	the	results	you	can	derive	from	your	chatbot,	think about	the	best	ways	that	you	can	drive	users	toward	your	chatbot,	while also	promoting	the	features	and	benefits	that	your	chatbot	can	offer	to subscribers.  	   39.	How	Can	Chatbots	Be	Used	in	the	Health	and Education	Fields?  When	most	people	hear	the	word	“chatbot,”	they	think	of	customer support.	While	many	of	the	chatbots	currently	in	operation	were	indeed created	for	customer	service	needs,	I	believe	that	some	of	the	greatest benefits	chatbots	have	to	offer	are	yet	to	be	seen.	In	particular,	I	predict that	chatbots	will	have	tremendous	positive	impacts	on	the	fields	of health	and	education.  Because	many	of	the	tasks	performed	in	these	industries	are	simple	yet important,	chatbots	could	be	an	excellent	tool	for	these	areas	in	the future,	providing	automated	assistance	that	can	generate	profound benefits.  Educational	Chatbots  In	the	future,	many	basic	learning	opportunities	will	likely	begin	with	an interaction	with	a	chatbot.	In	the	past,	a	person	who	wanted	to	learn something	new	had	to	find	the	right	book	and	take	the	time	to	read	it thoroughly	to	understand	a	new	concept.	Today,	we	can	learn	by	simply visiting	a	website	or	watching	a	video.	However,	none	of	those	activities have	the	same	potential	power	as	interacting	with	a	well-designed educational	chatbot.  In	the	future,	educational	chatbots	will	probably	be	developed	to	be	able to	incorporate	information	about	a	particular	student’s	knowledge	level about	a	given	topic.	It	could	then	use	this	information	to	provide customized	recommendations	on	the	educational	materials	that	would best	meet	that	student’s	needs.	Because	of	its	flexibility	and	relational design,	a	chatbot	provides	an	interactive	experience	with	the	potential	to be	much	more	interesting	and	engaging	than	watching	a	video	or	reading a	book,	both	of	which	are	fairly	passive	activities.  This	is	not	to	say	that	we	will	no	longer	need	teachers,	instructors	or coaches,	but	rather	to	suggest	that	chatbots	could	provide	people	in those	roles	with	incredible	tools	to	offer	learning	experiences	that	are more	personalized	and	effective.   Some	educational	institutions	could	begin	implementing	chatbots	right now	to	offer	supplemental	information	to	their	students.	One	example	of	a basic	learning	chatbot	that	is	available	already	is	called	SoccerAI.	This chatbot,	which	is	available	on	the	App	Store	for	iOS	devices,	can	be	used to	learn	the	basics	about	how	to	play	soccer.	A	friend	of	mine	told	me	that her	child	developed	an	interest	in	the	sport	after	using	the	chatbot, something	that	may	not	have	happened	by	simply	visiting	a	website	or watching	an	educational	video.  	  Figure	4.10.	Soccer	AI	Chatbot.  	   SoccerAI	was	developed	by	HeadAI,	one	of	the	leading	companies	in	the field	of	educational	chatbots.	Harri	Ketola,	the	CEO	of	the	company,	told me	that	the	instructional	content	for	this	chatbot	is	curated	through artificial	intelligence.	As	most	of	SoccerAI’s	content	is	in	the	form	of YouTube	videos,	an	AI	process	is	used	to	sort	through	massive quantities	of	videos,	find	the	ones	that	are	most	relevant	and	interesting, and	organize	them	for	the	chatbot’s	purposes.	You	can	learn	more	about this	chatbot	here:	www.headai.com soccerai  Health	Therapy	Chatbots  Currently,	there	is	an	ever-increasing	demand	for	the	development	of technology	to	improve	healthcare.	As	I’ve	mentioned	in	other	chapters, one	of	the	challenges	that	we’ll	likely	face	is	an	increase	in	mental disorders	related	to	overdependence	on	technology	and	reduced	social interactions.  Chatbots	could	offer	one	potential	solution	to	this	problem.	One	example of	such	a	chatbot,	which	is	hosted	on	Facebook	Messenger,	is	called Woebot.	This	chatbot	uses	cognitive-behavioral	therapy	 CBT 	to	help users	work	on	solving	their	emotional	problems	by	changing	harmful thought	and	behavioral	patterns.	{97}  The	Woebot	chatbot	tracks	a	user’s	mood	by	asking	simple	questions and	learning	from	the	responses	given	over	time.	You	can	get	more information	about	this	chatbot	at	https:  woebot.io  Based	on	the	answers	the	user	provides,	Woebot	offers	suggestions	or links	to	helpful	videos	or	games	with	the	objective	of	helping	the	person to	change	their	outlook	and	start	to	feel	better.  Researchers	at	Stanford	conducted	a	randomized	controlled	trial	test	of this	chatbot	with	a	number	of	young	adults	who	experienced	symptoms	of depression	and	anxiety.	Here	are	just	a	few	of	the	comments	the	users shared:  “I	love	Woebot	so	much.	I	hope	we	can	be	friends	forever.	I	actually	feel super	good	and	happy	when	I	see	that	it	‘remembered’	to	check	in	with me!”	{98}   “I	really	was	impressed	and	surprised	at	the	difference	the	bot	made	in my	everyday	life	in	terms	of	noticing	the	types	of	thinking	I	was	having and	changing	it.”{99}  “Woebot	is	a	fun	little	dude	and	I	hope	he	continues	improving.”{100}  The	answers	above	showcase	the	gratitude	some	users	felt	toward	the chatbot,	and	how	they	enjoyed	its	humanlike	qualities,	with	one	user even	personifying	it	to	the	point	of	calling	it	“little	dude.”  Imagine	the	possibilities	in	the	future,	when	we	might	be	able	to	have	a personalized	AI	doctor	that	can	offer	basic	diagnostic	questions	and suggestions,	while	letting	us	know	when	we	need	to	make	an appointment	with	a	human	physician.	We	could	also	benefit	from personal	coaching	chatbots	designed	to	help	us	reach	our	personal	and professional	goals.  There	is	an	abundance	of	ways	that	we	could	benefit	from	similar	health- based	chatbots	in	the	near	future.	As	with	any	medical	advice,	it’s	always a	good	idea	to	seek	out	scientific	evidence	supporting	any	claims	made about	the	health	benefits	a	chatbot	can	provide.	Likewise,	the	creators	of these	chatbots	have	a	high	degree	of	ethical	responsibility	to	their	users, as	these	tools	can	be	used	to	alter	human	behavior	for	better	or	for worse.  One	final	challenge	for	many	of	these	kinds	of	health	bots	will	be	the issue	of	privacy.	Users	will	undoubtedly	be	concerned	about	whether their	personal	comments	regarding	their	wellbeing	will	be	saved	on	a cloud-based	hosting	service	that	could	be	vulnerable	to	hackers.	For	this reason,	security	is	a	very	important	issue	that	will	need	to	be	addressed by	chatbot	developers.  	   Figure	4.11.	Woebot’s	Website	Shows	What	Woebot	is	Able	to	Do.  	   40.	What	Are	Some	Helpful	Chatbot	Terms	and Resources?  In	this	section,	we’ll	cover	some	of	the	most	common	terms	related	to chatbot	design,	in	addition	to	some	helpful	resources	you	can	use	to learn	more	about	employing	this	type	of	technology.  Common	Chatbot	Terms  Broadcast:	A	message	that	is	sent	proactively,	rather	than	reactively,	to your	chatbot’s	users.	A	single	broadcast	can	be	delivered	to	all	users	or to	a	particular	segment	of	your	list	of	subscribers.	For	chatbots	that operate	through	Facebook	Messenger,	users	need	to	subscribe	to	your chatbot	service	in	order	to	receive	your	broadcasts. Conversational	Flow:	The	degree	to	which	a	chatbot	is	able	to	mimic the	rhythms	and	tones	of	natural	human	conversation	when communicating	with	users.	As	you	design	your	own	chatbot,	you	should consider	how	you	want	the	conversational	flow	to	occur	between	chatbot and	user.  Conversational	User	Interface	 UI :	An	interface	that	is	designed	to	be used	based	on	written	or	verbal	human	speech,	rather	than	graphics, links	or	buttons.	When	designing	a	chatbot,	it	is	important	to	consider	the ways	that	you	can	make	your	conversational	UI	simple	and	intuitive	for your	users.{101} Dialogue:	The	chatbot’s	part	in	conversation	with	users.	A	chatbot’s dialogue	should	be	purpose	driven	and	engaging.  Entity:	An	entity	represents	a	data	type	that	provides	specific	information on	what	the	chatbot	user	wants.{102} Get	Started	Button:	A	button	that	users	can	press	to	begin	interacting with	the	chatbot.	On	Facebook	Messenger,	a	chatbot	will	not	begin	a conversation	until	the	user	clicks	on	the	“Get	Started”	option.  Intent:	The	intended	meaning	of	the	user’s	input.	Intent	is	particularly important	for	chatbots	built	using	natural	language	processing	 NLP ,	but   less	so	for	traditionally	designed,	rule-based	chatbots.{103}  Suggested	Responses:	Examples,	offered	by	the	chatbot,	of	ways	the user	can	answer	a	question.	This	is	a	way	for	the	chatbot	to	provide	the user	with	conversational	guidance,	as	well	as	insight	into	the	kinds	of services	it	offers. Web	Plug-Ins:	A	type	of	software	that	can	add	customized	features	to	a website.	The	Facebook	Messenger	platform	allows	users	to	begin	a conversation	with	a	chatbot	on	a	website	through	the	use	of	various	web plug-ins.  Welcome	Message:	The	initial	message	users	see	when	they	begin interacting	with	a	chatbot.	This	message	should	be	brief	and	clear,	while communicating	what	the	user	can	do	with	the	chatbot.	Alternatively,	you can	use	a	welcome	video.  Recommended	Resources	on	Chatbots  BotMock:	A	visual	tool	that	allows	you	to	build	and	test	the conversational	flow	for	your	chatbot.

In	this	chapter,	we’ll	explore	the	potential	changes	and	challenges	facing the	job	markets	in	the	future	as	a	direct	result	of	the	new	technologies being	created	today.  Most	of	these	changes	will	occur	because	of	the	proliferation	of	artificial intelligence	technologies.	They	will	impact	our	lives	and	societies	in countless	ways,	as	will	the	exponential	growth	of	other	technologies	like nanotechnology,	quantum	computing,	blockchain,	biotechnology,	the Internet	of	Things,	virtual	and	augmented	reality,	and	3D	printing.  As	these	tools	are	developed	and	adapted	to	work	together,	there	will likely	be	dramatic	and	rapid	changes,	which	society	may	or	may	not	be fully	prepared	for.  It	is	nearly	impossible	to	predict	with	any	degree	of	certainty	what	our future	will	look	like.	In	a	report	called	Megatrends	2017,	the	Finnish Innovation	Fund	Sitra	described	the	nature	of	work	in	the	future,	including two	possible	outcomes:  1.	One	possibility	is	that	only	relatively	few	people	will	be	employed,  and	even	fewer	will	reap	the	benefits	of	their	work.  2.	The	other	possibility	is	that	the	nature	of	work	will	change,	but  there	will	be	plenty	of	paid	work	for	everyone.{104}  While	no	one	knows	for	sure	what	the	future	holds,	the	only	certainty	is that	these	technologies	will	bring	change.	While	millions	of	jobs	will	likely be	replaced	by	new	kinds	of	automation,	artificial	intelligence	and robotization,	there	is	also	great	potential	for	new	types	of	work opportunities	to	be	created.  For	this	reason,	we	should	begin	to	seriously	consider	this	matter	now,	to better	enable	ourselves	to	proactively	approach	the	technologies	of	the future.  In	this	chapter,	you’ll	learn	about	some	of	the	issues	concerning	people being	displaced	from	their	jobs	due	to	a	rise	in	robotic	and	automated technologies.	You’ll	also	discover	which	industries	are	currently	growing, as	well	as	some	of	the	interesting	AI-related	jobs	that	will	soon	be available.   Lastly,	we’ll	take	a	look	at	the	concept	of	a	basic	universal	income, including	the	benefits	and	disadvantages	associated	with	this	idea.  available.  	   41.	How	Many	Jobs	Will	Be	Lost	Due	to	Automation and	Robotic	Technologies?  Perhaps	one	of	the	biggest	questions	that	arises	as	AI	technologies continue	to	develop	is	whether	humans	will	be	replaced	in	the	workforce as	robots	become	capable	of	doing	the	same	tasks	as	traditional laborers.  In	a	widely-cited	report	called	The	Future	of	Employment:	How Susceptible	are	Jobs	to	Computerisation?,	Oxford	researchers	Carl Benedikt	Frey	and	Michael	A.	Osborne	indicate	that	up	to	47	percent	of U.S.	workers	will	face	the	threat	of	losing	their	jobs	to	automated technologies	over	the	next	two	decades.	This	was	the	first	study	of	its kind	to	suggest	that	a	large	number	of	human	workers	could	be	replaced by	robotics	and	AI	technologies.{105}  A	report	called	A	Future	That	Works:	Automation,	Employment,	and Productivity,	based	on	a	study	by	the	McKinsey	Global	Institute,	predicts that	nearly	half	of	our	work	tasks	will	be	performed	by	some	form	of	robot by	the	year	2055.	Interestingly,	this	report	focuses	on	specific	tasks	and activities	that	are	likely	to	be	automated,	rather	than	on	complete	jobs.{106}  Another	study	done	more	recently	by	McKinsey	estimates	that	between 400	and	800	million	workers	could	lose	their	jobs	to	automated	systems by	the	year	2030.{107}  Clearly,	this	will	create	a	huge	need	for	individuals	to	be	able	to	learn new	skills	to	enable	them	to	take	on	different	kinds	of	work.	For	this reason,	it	is	important	for	governments	to	create	retraining	programs now,	in	addition	to	coming	up	with	ways	to	help	ease	the	financial	burden so	many	will	suffer	due	to	losing	their	jobs.	For	example,	governments could	help	by	implementing	supplemental	income	programs,	such	as basic	universal	income,	which	we’ll	discuss	later	in	this	chapter.  This	period	of	transition	is	probably	one	of	the	toughest	challenges	we’ll face	in	the	near	future	as	a	result	of	the	rapid	changes	in	technology.	It	is an	issue	that	will	require	proactive	collaboration	between	countries,	and between	entities	in	the	public	and	private	sectors,	as	well	as	input	from experts	in	a	variety	of	disciplines.   experts	in	a	variety	of	disciplines.  These	changes	may	seem	startling,	but	it	is	important	to	remember	that every	technological	advance	throughout	history	has	generated	new	kinds of	jobs	that	did	not	exist	previously.	It	is	always	difficult	to	imagine	all	the ways	that	new	technologies	will	change	our	current	circumstances	ahead of	time.	However	in	this	scenario,	it	is	very	possible	that	the	amount	of jobs	lost	to	AI	and	robots	may	outnumber	the	additional	jobs	created	to sustain	the	new	workflow.  We	cannot	predict	the	future	with	any	certainty,	but	with	the	rapid technological	developments	and	advancements	currently	taking	place	in companies	worldwide,	it	is	best	to	be	prepared	for	the	socioeconomic changes	that	may	occur	on	a	global	scale.  	   42.	Which	Jobs	Will	Be	Replaced	by	Robots	First?  Want	to	know	whether	your	job	is	likely	to	be	filled	by	a	robot	in	the	next	5 to	10	years?  As	AI	technologies	continue	to	grow	and	develop,	many	people	are becoming	increasingly	concerned	about	the	number	and	kinds	of	jobs	in which	robots	are	likely	to	replace	human	workers	in	the	future.	This	is	not an	unfounded	concern.	In	fact,	it	has	never	been	more	important	to spread	knowledge	about	the	future	of	jobs	than	it	is	now,	so	that	working people	can	have	a	chance	to	study	and	acquire	new	skill	sets,	preparing ahead	of	time	for	the	upcoming	changes	in	the	workforce.  Taiwanese	venture	capitalist	and	technology	executive	Dr.	Kai-Fu	Lee	is the	founder	of	Sinovation	Ventures,	an	early-stage	venture	capital	firm that	invests	in	many	AI	companies.	One	of	the	leading	experts	on	the growth	of	artificial	intelligence,	he	has	developed	a	fascinating	formula	to help	identify	which	jobs	are	most	likely	to	be	replaced	by	robots	in	the future,	stating	that:  “Every	job	which	takes	less	than	5	seconds	to	think	will	be	done	by robots.”{108}  I	am	personally	quite	fond	of	this	theory	and	find	it	to	be	a	very	helpful guideline.	Take	a	few	moments	to	consider	your	own	job,	and	as	you	do, ask	yourself	which	of	your	typical	daily	tasks	you	can	perform	without taking	5	seconds	or	longer	to	think	about	first.	Could	you	acquire	new skills	that	would	allow	you	to	perform	more	complex	or	creative	tasks	in place	of	these?  Martin	Ford,	author	of	Rise	of	the	Robots,	also	highlights	the	fact	that	the kinds	of	tasks	that	are	routine	and	repetitive	will	be	the	first	to	be assigned	to	robots,	saying:  “I	personally	believe	that,	in	the	future,	we	could	well	get	into	a	situation where	jobs	simply	disappear.	And	it	will	be	especially	any	kind	of	job	that is	routine	or	repetitive	on	some	level.	A	lot	of	those	jobs	are	going	to disappear.”{109}  When	discussing	tasks	that	are	automated	or	repetitive,	most	people   When	discussing	tasks	that	are	automated	or	repetitive,	most	people tend	to	think	first	of	low-income	jobs.	However,	robots	and	AI technologies	will	be	able	to	replace	a	lot	of	white-collar	workers	as	well.  According	to	several	experts	in	the	field,	jobs	that	require	analysis	of	data and	trends	will	also	be	among	the	first	to	be	given	to	robots.	This	includes jobs	in	the	healthcare	and	financial	industries,	both	of	which	rely	on analytics	and	trends.  There	are	already	examples	of	white-collar	jobs	being	lost	to	robotic technologies.	In	the	financial	field,	the	American	investment	bank Goldman	Sachs	Group,	which	once	employed	600	traders	in	its	New York	office,	now	has	the	same	tasks	being	performed	by	only	two	human traders	and	an	array	of	AI	tools.{110}  An	additional	change	in	the	workforce	that	is	likely	to	occur	is	within	the transportation	industry.	Already,	self-driving	cars	are	beginning	to	replace traditional	jobs	like	taxi	driving.	Over	time,	it	will	become	increasingly more	common	to	see	vehicles	of	all	kinds,	including	boats	and	delivery trucks,	that	do	not	require	human	drivers.	The	implementation	of	this technology	will	likely	take	some	time,	however.  Figure	5.2.	illustrates	64	jobs	that	will	likely	be	endangered	by	the	new era	of	self-driving	cars.	This	information	was	compiled	by	futurist	Thomas Frey,	who	believes	that	as	we	begin	to	adopt	self-driving	cars,	many more	kinds	of	jobs	may	actually	be	replaced	as	well.  	   Figure	5.2.	64	Jobs	That	Will	Disappear	in	the	Self-Driving	Car	Era.  	  One	helpful	way	of	predicting	which	human	jobs	will	probably	be	replaced by	robotic	workers	is	to	consider	which	tasks	require	little	use	of	basic human	qualities	like	empathy,	intuition,	emotional	intelligence, negotiation,	complex	communication,	coaching,	and	creativity.  The	McKinsey	report	suggests	that	one	of	the	ways	we	can	predict	which kinds	of	jobs	will	be	the	first	to	be	automated	is	by	identifying	those	that involve	physical	labor	in	a	predictable	environment.	Examples	of	these   kinds	of	positions	might	include	assembly	line,	cleaning,	or	fast	food	jobs. {111}  Interested	in	learning	whether	your	job	is	likely	to	become	automated? Take	a	look	at	these	tools:   	Will	Robots	Take	My	Job?:	Simply	type	in	an	occupation	and	you can	discover	the	probability,	in	the	form	of	a	percentage,	of	it	being converted	from	human	to	robotic	workers.	The	results	shown	are based	on	the	report	mentioned	earlier	by	Frey	and	Osborne	called The	Future	of	Employment:	How	Susceptible	are	Jobs	to Computerisation?{112}	https:  willrobotstakemyjob.com   	Can	a	Robot	Do	Your	Job?:	This	tool,	which	was	created	by	the Financial	Times	based	on	research	conducted	by	McKinsey,	is	a helpful	resource	that	focuses	on	specific	tasks,	rather	than	entire jobs,	that	are	likely	to	be	automated.{113}	https:  ig.ft.com can-a- robot-do-your-job  	   Figure	5.3.	Can	a	Robot	Do	Your	Job	by	Financial	Times	at  https:  ig.ft.com can-a-robot-do-your-job  	  For	example,	if	you	were	to	select	that	you	are	a	postsecondary teacher,	the	tool	would	show	that	9	out	of	the	57	activities	that	you perform	regularly	could	be	done	by	a	robot,	while	also	listing	the remaining	48	tasks	that	robots	cannot	currently	perform,	according	to McKinsey’s	research.  These	kinds	of	tools	and	studies	can	help	us	to	transform	our	thought processes	about	the	nature	of	work,	while	also	aiding	in	the	design	of future	tasks	and	opportunities	that	will	be	best	suited	to	human	workers.  	   43.	Which	Jobs	Will	Be	Harder	to	Replace	with Robotic	Technologies?  As	we	have	discussed	in	other	sections,	there	are	many	jobs	that	will likely	be	replaced	with	AI	technologies	in	the	future.	However,	there	are still	many	categories	of	work	that	robots	are	not	well	suited	to	perform.  A	study	by	the	Oxford	Martin	School	grouped	the	jobs	that	are	less	likely to	be	replaced	by	robots	into	three	basic	categories,	which	are	listed below	with	examples:  1.	Jobs	that	Require	Hands-on	Manipulation   	Oral	Surgeons   	Makeup	Artists  	Chiropractors   	Firefighters   	Choreographers   	Curators  	Art	Directors  2.	Jobs	that	Require	Creativity  3.	Jobs	that	Require	Social	Perception   	Mental	Health	Workers   	Clergy   	Nurses  	Coaches	and	Scouts{114}  The	figure	below	illustrates	these	categories,	as	well	as	the	probability	of each	of	the	above	examples	becoming	automated.   	  Figure	5.4.	Jobs	That	Can’t	Be	Automated.  	  In	each	of	the	categories,	there	are	also	a	number	of	other	skills	and occupations	that	are	not	mentioned	here.  This	study	is	just	one	example	of	an	analysis	of	the	kinds	of	jobs	that would	be	difficult	to	replace	with	robot	workers.  From	my	own	observations,	I	have	identified	several	additional	factors that	make	some	jobs	harder	to	automate,	which	include	the	following:  1.	Jobs	that	Don’t	Involve	Large	Quantities	of	Data:	None	of	the jobs	listed	in	the	three	categories	above	deal	with	the	analysis	or collection	of	large	amounts	of	data.	In	contrast,	consider	the	kinds of	work	performed	by	someone	in	the	financial	sector,	in	which numbers	and	trends	are	a	big	part	of	everyday	tasks.	Obviously, this	does	not	imply	that	all	jobs	in	a	field	like	finance	will	be	lost	to AI	technologies;	simply	that	they	will	be	generally	easier	to	replace than	those	that	do	not	deal	with	data.	Additionally,	the   implementation	of	AI	tools	that	collect	and	analyze	data	may create	new	kinds	of	jobs	that	do	not	yet	exist.  2.	Jobs	Based	on	Human	Interaction:	Each	of	the	jobs	listed	above  involves	some	degree	of	interpersonal	communication.	This	will always	be	an	area	in	which	humans	will	be	superior	to	AI	systems. For	this	reason,	developing	strong	communication	skills	will	likely raise	your	value	in	the	job	markets	for	these	types	of	occupations in	the	future.  3.	Jobs	that	Have	Minimal	Repetition	or	Routine:	Because  repetitive	tasks	are	one	thing	that	robotic	tools	excel	at,	the	jobs that	vary	greatly	from	day	to	day	are	less	likely	to	be	replaced easily	by	AI	technologies.  4.	Jobs	that	are	Difficult	to	Learn	Through	Simple	Observation: AI	tools	rely	on	monitors	and	cameras	to	collect	data	and	to	learn. Therefore,	jobs	requiring	a	high	degree	of	intuition	or	flexibility	will be	harder	to	replace.  Take	a	moment	to	consider	these	four	factors,	thinking	of	several occupations	and	where	they	might	land	on	a	scale	of	jobs	that	are	easier or	harder	to	replace	with	AI	tools.	The	more	often	you	repeat	this exercise,	the	better	you’ll	be	able	to	comprehend	the	skills	and	job markets	that	will	continue	to	thrive	in	the	future.  Also,	jobs	that	require	planning	or	cross-domain	thinking	are	poorly suited	for	robots	and	should	therefore	be	more	actively	promoted	by universities	and	other	educational	institutions.{115}		In	addition,	jobs	that are	unpredictable	in	nature	tend	to	be	more	difficult	for	robots	to	perform.  My	suggestion	to	everyone	is	to	consider	the	ways	in	which	AI	could	be used	to	benefit	your	workflow.	This	includes	educating	yourself	about	the potential	applications	for	AI	and	testing	out	various	AI-based	solutions. You	may	also	wish	to	research	other	emerging	technologies	and	how they	could	help	you	at	work,	like	3D	printing,	nanotechnology,	quantum computing,	blockchain,	biotechnology,	the	Internet	of	Things,	virtual reality	and	augmented	reality.   	   44.	Which	Industries	Will	Offer	the	Best	Job Opportunities	in	the	Future?  As	the	technologies	we’ve	discussed	continue	to	grow	and	expand,	being applied	in	new	and	innovative	ways,	there	will	probably	be	a	multitude	of jobs	and	business	opportunities	arising	that	would	be	difficult	to	predict	in advance.  While	these	emerging	technologies	will	undoubtedly	bring	many	changes to	our	workforce,	not	all	of	these	changes	will	be	negative.	AI technologies	will	also	generate	many	new	opportunities	for	human workers	to	take	on	different	kinds	of	tasks	and	jobs.  According	to	John	Koetsier,	a	journalist	and	tech	analyst,	the	13	fields below	will	offer	new	jobs	and	opportunities	for	innovation	in	the	future. Each	of	these	fields	is	also	more	likely	to	be	staffed	primarily	by	human workers	than	delegated	to	automated	services.	These	13	fields	are:   	Artificial	Intelligence  	Augmented	or	Mixed	Reality  	Virtual	Reality  	Drones  	Robotics	and	Automation  	Genomics  	Brain-machine	Interfaces  	Data	Science  	Blockchain  	Internet	of	Things  	Nanotechnology	and	Swarm	Intelligence  	Quantum	Computing  	3D	Printing{116}   In	addition,	a	study	by	Forrester	Research	estimates	that	approximately 15	million	new	jobs	will	be	created	in	the	United	States	alone	over	the next	10	years	as	a	direct	result	of	AI	and	automation.	This	is	equivalent	to 10	percent	of	the	American	workforce	today.{117}  One	of	the	industries	that	will	continue	to	generate	numerous opportunities	is	health	care.	Not	only	will	technology	create	new applications	and	tools	to	aid	in	the	practice	of	medicine,	but	it	will	also probably	create	a	need	for	additional	types	of	treatments	for	symptoms resulting	from	addictions	to	technological	applications	and	devices. These	symptoms	might	include	a	lack	of	interpersonal	skills	stemming from	overuse	of	devices	or	virtual	reality	environments,	for	example, which	is	why	I	recommend	moderation	in	any	implementation	of	new technologies.  Due	to	the	requirements	of	the	Paris	Climate	Accord,	many	countries	will soon	need	to	take	measurable	actions	toward	implementing	renewable energy	technologies.	This	will	create	significant	job	opportunities	in	the manufacturing,	construction,	and	installation	of	products	that	serve	these needs.	One	study	found	that	this	alone	could	create	up	to	10	million	new jobs	in	the	fields	of	wind	energy,	solar	energy,	and	energy	efficiency.{118}  Additionally,	any	field	related	to	what	is	known	as	“soft	human	skills,” including	emotional	intelligence,	creativity	and	social	skills,	will	have	a higher	value	in	the	job	market	of	the	future,	providing	people	who	have those	skills	with	new	and	interesting	job	options.  	   45.	Will	Artificial	Intelligence	Help	the	Economy Grow?  Experts	believe	that	artificial	intelligence,	automation	and	robotics	will generate	significant	gains	in	productivity	and	efficiency,	enabling products	and	services	to	be	produced	and	provided	faster	than	ever before.	That	in	turn	will	generate	fantastic	opportunities	for	the businesses	on	the	leading	edge	of	these	technologies.  In	his	book	Epiphany	Z,	futurist	Thomas	Frey	highlights	an	interesting concept	known	as	the	law	of	exponential	capabilities,	saying,	“With automation,	every	exponential	decrease	in	effort	creates	an	equal	and opposite	exponential	increase	in	capabilities.”	Basically,	this	means	that when	it	takes	less	time	to	perform	a	task,	we	can	perform	a	greater number	of	tasks	overall.{119}  Many	of	the	world’s	leading	AI	experts	believe	that	artificial	intelligence will	assist	and	improve	the	working	experience	for	people	around	the world.	Manoj	Saxena,	the	first	general	manager	for	IBM’s	Watson,	puts	it this	way:	“There	are	1.3	billion	global	workers	whose	jobs	will	be dramatically	enhanced	and	improved	through	AI.”{120}  Personally,	I	agree	with	Saxena’s	views,	but	I	also	believe	that	there	is	a huge	knowledge	gap	that	will	need	to	be	addressed	in	order	for	people	to understand	the	benefits	and	applications	of	AI	to	their	workflows.	This	is one	of	the	main	reasons	why	I	was	motivated	to	write	this	book.  Considering	the	many	business	processes	that	AI	can	improve	upon,	it	is easy	to	imagine	how	AI	will	be	able	to	significantly	enhance	productivity. One	study	done	by	Accenture	concluded	that	in	some	countries, including	Finland,	Sweden	and	the	United	States,	labor	productivity	could increase	by	35-37	percent	by	the	year	2035	because	of	these technologies.{121}  The	same	study	found	that	artificial	intelligence	tools	have	the	capability to	double	the	GDP	of	12	developed	countries	by	the	year	2035.	It	also concluded	that	there	are	three	channels	by	which	AI	can	lead	to	growth:    	Intelligent	Automation:	Because	AI	tools	are	capable	of	self-  learning	and	can	automate	even	complex	physical	tasks,	they	can lead	to	a	greater	level	of	efficiency	in	production.   	Labor	Capital	Automation:	AI	can	help	workers	to	focus	on  performing	only	the	tasks	they	do	best.   	Innovation	Diffusion:	AI	has	the	potential	to	propel	innovation  forward.{122}  When	AI	is	used	to	automate	repetitive	or	data-heavy	tasks,	it	creates opportunities	for	human	workers	to	focus	on	the	tasks	that	only	they	can do,	leveraging	the	most	potential	from	both	the	AI	and	the	human resources.  While	AI	developments	are	sometimes	portrayed	negatively	in	the	media, these	kinds	of	studies	can	help	to	highlight	the	many	potential	benefits we	can	experience	from	their	applications.  In	order	to	gain	the	greatest	economic	benefits	from	AI,	it	will	be	crucial for	us	to	share	knowledge	and	insights	across	our	society.	Building	AI research	and	development	centers	in	every	major	city	could	further facilitate	the	application	of	AI	to	various	industries,	while	also	benefitting small	businesses	and	entrepreneurs.	The	more	open	our	society	is	to sharing	information	about	AI,	the	more	the	entire	world	will	benefit	from its	growth	and	development.  	   46.	What	Will	Be	Some	of	the	Most	Common	AI- Related	Jobs?  If	you’re	interested	in	some	of	the	technical	aspects	of	AI,	there	are	a number	of	fantastic	employment	opportunities	available	to	you	already. The	development	of	AI	technologies	is	a	top	priority	for	most	of	the leading	companies	right	now,	and	they	are	on	the	lookout	for	talented	AI workers.  These	are	some	of	the	AI-related	job	titles	that	are	currently	in	the highest	demand	on	job	search	portals:	data	scientists,	software engineers,	research	scientists,	machine	learning	experts,	and	deep learning	experts.  You	can	learn	about	these	topics	through	a	number	of	different	online courses.	Most	of	these	courses,	once	completed,	usually	offer	either	a diploma	or	certificate	that	can	add	accreditation	to	your	resume,	or	a badge	that	can	be	showcased	on	your	LinkedIn	profile.  However,	there	will	be	an	even	greater	demand	for	professionals	who understand	how	AI	works	in	general,	as	well	as	how	to	help	companies and	individuals	apply	these	technologies	for	the	benefit	of	businesses and	society.	Below	are	some	of	the	most	interesting	examples	of	these types	of	jobs,	which	I	believe	will	be	in	demand	in	the	future:   	AI	Chatbot	Designer:	A	professional	who	knows	how	to	design	AI-  based	chatbots	that	can	attend	to	basic	customer	service	needs and	provide	a	positive	user	experience.   	AI	Digital	Marketing	Expert:	Someone	who	understands	how	to  leverage	various	digital	marketing	and	social	media	tools	that employ	AI	to	create	more	effective	marketing	strategies.   	AI	Business	Strategy	Consultant:	An	expert	who	analyzes	a  company	and	recommends	ways	that	company	can	build	AI services	and	products	with	tools	like	IBM’s	Watson,	Microsoft Azure,	or	Amazon	Web	Services.	While	it	can	be	helpful	to	develop   internal	AI	tools,	it	is	also	possible	to	purchase	existing	solutions from	well-known	providers	like	the	ones	listed	above.   	AI	Strategy	Consultant	for	the	Public	Sector:	An	expert	who	can identify	potential	challenges	that	will	arise	due	to	the	introduction	of AI	into	society	and	can	solve	problems	through	AI	training.	This	is an	important	role	for	helping	society	to	become	familiar	and comfortable	with	the	use	of	new	AI	technologies.	This	type	of professional	could	also	serve	those	who	have	lost	their	jobs	to	AI and	automation	by	matching	individuals	with	suitable	retraining programs	to	help	them	obtain	new	types	of	employment.   	Tech-Addiction	Counselor	or	Coach:	A	skilled	counselor	or  coach	who	understands,	and	knows	how	to	treat,	the	emotional	and physical	impacts	of	the	rapid	growth	of	AI	and	the	problems	that may	arise	from	overuse.	With	the	increasing	presence	of	AI technologies	in	our	everyday	lives	comes	the	potential	for	users	to become	addicted	to	some	of	these	products.	Also,	some	people may	suffer	from	negative	emotional	consequences	due	to	an overreliance	on	AI	at	the	expense	of	normal	social	interactions	and relationships	with	humans.   	Creativity	Coach:	A	trained	professional	with	experience	in	helping  others	to	develop	human-based	skills	including	social	and emotional	intelligence,	and	creativity.	This	is	an	important	role	that, because	it	cannot	be	filled	by	robots,	will	hold	a	great	deal	of	value for	people	in	the	future.  The	list	above	includes	just	a	few	of	the	jobs	that	I	believe	will	be	in	high demand	as	AI	continues	to	grow	and	develop.	There	will	also	be	plenty	of new	careers	that	we	can’t	even	imagine	yet,	which	will	arise	from	the	new challenges	and	opportunities	created	by	AI	technologies.  In	addition	to	those	listed	above,	there	are	also	several	interesting	jobs related	to	AI	that	are	already	being	posted	on	job	search	websites.	The list	below	was	gathered	from	the	Glassdoor	website,	and	each	requires	a combination	of	AI-related	skills	and	additional	skillsets:    	AI	Journalists:	Reporters	who	are	able	to	write	articles	about	AI	for  mainstream	news	outlets.   	AI	Attorneys:	Legal	professionals	who	handle	intellectual	property  and	technical	cases	related	to	AI.   	AI	Technical	Sales	Directors:	Salespeople	who	are	able	to  understand	and	market	AI-based	products	to	consumers.   	AI	User	Interface	Designers:	Developers	who	can	apply	AI	to  customer	interfaces	to	improve	their	experiences.   	AI	Marketing	Managers:	Professionals	who	build	awareness	for  companies	that	provide	AI	products	and	services.{123}  Because	artificial	intelligence	will	have	an	impact	on	so	many	business models,	we	will	likely	see	a	whole	range	of	similar	job	descriptions	for familiar	roles	that	will	incorporate	AI	components,	creating	a	variety	of new	career	opportunities.  As	previously	mentioned,	perhaps	the	most	important	skill	in	the	future will	be	the	ability	to	understand	the	complex	ways	in	which	AI	will	change business	and	society.	Such	an	understanding	will	be	valuable	in	so	many ways	to	help	companies	and	individuals	transition	into	this	new	way	of life.  Starting	a	Company	in	the	Era	of	AI  People	often	dream	about	starting	their	own	business,	perhaps envisioning	it	as	a	way	to	be	their	own	boss,	feel	more	professionally fulfilled,	or	achieve	financial	success.	However,	starting	a	business	can also	mean	facing	challenges	that	many	average	people	are	not	ready	to handle.	Tough	questions	arise,	like:	Where	will	I	find	clients?	How	will	I pay	my	expenses?	What	if	I	fail?  One	of	the	main	challenges	that	entrepreneurs	encounter	is	a	lack	of education	on	what	it	takes	to	succeed	in	business.	I	believe	this	is something	that	should	be	taught	from	an	early	age,	as	well	as	how	to recognize	and	utilize	personal	strengths	and	weaknesses.   As	mentioned	earlier	in	the	chapter,	according	to	a	recent	McKinsey report,	between	400	and	800	million	people	may	need	to	switch occupations	by	the	year	2030,	which	will	clearly	create	some	big challenges	in	our	society.{124}  Some	of	these	people	might	want	to	simply	find	a	new	place	of employment,	but	for	many,	a	more	helpful	approach	may	be	to	start	their own	business.  Past	methods	of	hiring	the	staff	needed	to	start	a	new	business	can	often be	cost	prohibitive	in	today’s	world.	Traditionally,	most	new	businesses would	hire	full-time	employees	to	take	on	roles	in	sales,	marketing, customer	support,	graphic	design	and	administration.	However,	when starting	a	business	from	scratch	today,	it	can	be	difficult	to	generate	the funds	necessary	to	support	that	kind	of	infrastructure	without	the	aid	of outside	investors	or	government	grants.  One	potential	solution	to	this	would	be	to	apply	a	new	model,	leveraging both	the	power	of	artificial	intelligence	tools	and	outsourced	talent,	to	get a	business	up	and	running.	In	the	figure	below,	you	can	take	a	look	at	the differences	between	the	old	patterns	of	building	a	company	and	the	new methods	available	in	the	era	of	AI.  The	new	approach,	a	combination	of	using	AI	services	provided	by	large tech	companies	and	outsourced	talent	in	the	form	of	freelancers,	offers significant	cost	savings	and	huge	gains	in	productivity	and	efficiency. Additionally,	this	method	provides	a	more	flexible	structure	which	can	be changed	or	stopped	at	a	moment’s	notice,	as	well	as	location independence.  	   Figure	5.5.	New	Company	Organizational	Chart.  	  Here	are	some	of	the	ways	that	you	can	leverage	AI	services	and outsourced	talent	as	you	start	your	company:   	AI	Services:	Large	tech	companies	like	IBM,	Google	and	Amazon offer	cloud-based	AI	services,	which	allow	you	to	basically	“buy”	AI from	them.	Currently,	you	can	use	these	types	of	AI	services	to help	with	things	like	market	research,	digital	marketing	automation, and	even	basic	administrative	assistance	tasks.	They	can	also	be used	to	help	you	build	your	own	customized	chatbots.	These	are invaluable	tools	that	can	help	your	company	handle	basic	customer service	support	functions	while	reducing,	or	even	eliminating,	the need	for	hiring	staff.   	Freelance	Talent:	There	are	many	freelancing	sites	available  where	you	can	post	job	openings	in	a	variety	of	fields.	For	example, you	can	find	graphic	designers,	administrative	assistants,	and	even AI	programmers	through	these	platforms	who	can	help	you	to accomplish	more	than	you	could	on	your	own.	Hiring	help	this	way   enables	you	to	avoid	all	of	the	overhead	costs	associated	with traditional	employment,	such	as	office	space,	benefits,	and vacation	time.  As	more	people	take	advantage	of	this	model,	we	will	likely	see	an increase	in	single-person	companies	that	are	better	prepared	to	adapt	to the	changing	technological	environment	of	our	world.  This	is	not	to	say	that	nobody	should	hire	workers	in	the	traditional manner,	but	rather	to	encourage	entrepreneurs	to	consider	new	models that	incorporate	AI	and	freelance	talent,	as	these	models	are	usually more	suitable	for	the	current	technological	climate.  For	every	small	business,	it	will	be	critical	to	examine	the	kinds	of	tasks for	which	AI	can	be	used.	In	Chapter	8,	we’ll	discuss	some	of	the	AI- related	services	provided	by	large	tech	companies,	although	there	are more	than	we	have	room	to	discuss	in	this	book.  	   47.	What	Are	the	Skills	to	Strive	for	in	the	Future	Job Markets?  Because	the	introduction	of	AI	technologies	will	bring	huge	changes	to the	job	markets	of	the	future,	it	is	imperative	to	start	developing	skills	that will	add	value	to	your	resume	now.  With	this	in	mind,	I’ve	compiled	a	list	of	some	of	the	skills	that	will	be	the most	valuable	in	the	coming	years.	While	there	is	no	guarantee	that these	skills	will	land	you	a	job	on	their	own,	they	will	make	you	a	more attractive	candidate	to	employers,	while	also	adding	to	the	quality	of	your personal	life	and	relationships.  The	excerpt	below	includes	a	description	of	24	skills	that	I	published previously	in	a	book	entitled	The	Future	of	Higher	Education	-	How Emerging	Technologies	Will	Change	Education	Forever.{125}  People	Skills	for	the	Future  1.	Self-awareness	and	Self-assessment:	In	today’s	rapidly changing	and	complex	world,	self-awareness	is	extremely valuable,	helping	people	to	recognize	their	full	potential	and	areas that	might	need	to	be	improved.	It	can	also	help	people	to	identify and	accept	their	uniqueness,	which	can	add	self-esteem	and motivation	for	learning.	This	skill	is	particularly	valuable	for entrepreneurs	and	freelancers.  2.	Emotional	Intelligence:	By	one	common	definition,	emotional  intelligence	is	one’s	capacity	to	be	aware	of	and	express emotions.	Historically,	showing	or	talking	about	emotions	was once	viewed	as	a	sign	of	weakness	in	many	cultures,	but	in	recent years,	more	and	more	professionals	are	starting	to	discover	the benefits	of	emotional	intelligence.	I	personally	believe	that	we	are only	beginning	to	discover	the	power	of	this	skill.  3.	Social	Intelligence:	This	skill	relates	to	how	one	is	able	to	interact with	others	in	various	situations.	It	involves	a	basic	understanding of	the	thoughts	and	opinions	of	others.   4.	Interpersonal	Intelligence:	The	ways	that	we	communicate	and socialize	with	our	close	family	and	friends	can	actually	help	us	to have	a	more	balanced	life	and	a	greater	sense	of	well-being	and happiness.	This	in	turn	allows	us	to	put	greater	efforts	into	your work.  5.	Empathy	and	Active	Listening:	Maintaining	a	deep  understanding	of	the	ways	that	people	experience	things	will	help us	to	move	forward	in	business	and	in	our	personal	lives.  6.	Cultural	Flexibility:	This	is	the	ability	to	quickly	adapt	to	new  cultures	and	new	ways	of	working	and	living.	This	goes	beyond cultural	understanding,	allowing	people	to	be	flexible	when	they encounter	different	belief	systems	and	cultural	values.  7.	Perseverance	and	Passion:	Many	people	pursue	quick	fixes	and instant	gratification,	so	teaching	patience	for	long-term	gratification is	vital.	One	way	to	teach	this	skill	is	to	share	inspiring	role	models and	case	studies	of	people	who	have	had	success,	especially when	the	examples	offered	relate	in	some	way	to	what	the students	are	learning.  8.	A	Focus	on	the	Common	Good:	Recognizing	the	value	of	the  common	good,	rather	than	simply	focusing	on	individual	wants	and needs,	can	help	people	to	work	together.  9.	Mindfulness	and	Meditation:	There	are	countless	studies	that  show	the	benefits	of	these	practices,	and	there	are	more	and	more stories	of	high	achievers	in	various	industries	 sports,	business, finance,	and	more 	finding	success	through	mindfulness	and meditation.  10.	Physical	Training:	Maintaining	physical	balance	can	help	you	to  enjoy	clarity,	mental	focus,	and	a	healthier	life	in	general.	As people	begin	to	spend	more	time	in	front	of	the	screen,	physical motion	will	become	even	more	vital.  11.	Storytelling:	Storytelling	is	one	of	the	most	natural	ways	for  humans	to	communicate	with	each	other	through	common   understanding.	Thousands	of	years	ago,	storytelling	was	the primary	form	of	communication	and	this	same	form	is	still	very helpful	today.	Stories	are	powerful	tools	to	evoke	emotion	and	to understand	complex	situations.  Business	Skills	for	the	Future  12.	Problem	Solving:	This	skill	is	more	relevant	than	ever	due	to	the  speed	of	technological	innovation	and	the	changing	nature	of	the way	people	do	business.	Problem	solving	skills	can	help	people	to understand	their	co-workers,	environments,	and	even	the	tools and	machines	that	they	interact	with.  13.	Creativity:	It	is	easy	to	overlook	this	simple	skill,	but	it	will	be	a  critical	part	of	many	career	markets	going	forward.	As	more technology	is	introduced	into	business	and	education,	it	will become	increasingly	important	for	people	to	use	their	creativity	to develop	unique	and	innovative	ways	to	implement	that	technology.  14.	Adaptability	to	New	Technology:	Moving	forward,	the	people  who	are	willing	and	able	to	adapt	to	new	technologies	and	the opportunities	they	provide	are	going	to	have	the	best	orientation towards	success,	while	those	who	resist	new	technologies	are likely	to	fall	behind	or	miss	out.	While	it	is	important	for	universities to	teach	students	how	to	be	proactive	with	new	technologies,	they should	also	put	resources	into	training	teachers	about	creative ways	to	use	technology	within	the	classroom.  15.	Entrepreneurial	Mindset:	Within	the	next	5-10	years,  advancements	in	robotics	and	machinery	will	likely	change	the kinds	of	jobs	available	on	the	job	market.	People	who	have	strong entrepreneurial	skills	and	know	how	to	seek	advice	in	the	right places	will	be	able	to	experience	the	benefits	of	these	changes.  16.	Sales	and	Marketing:	More	than	ever	before,	people	are  creating	businesses	centered	around	their	passions.	For	this	to work,	they	need	to	understand	the	fundamentals	of	sales	and marketing	techniques,	including	how	to	communicate	what	they can	offer	and	how	to	acquire	new	customers.   17.	Data	Analysis:	According	to	Clive	Humby,	“Data	is	the	oil	of	the  21st	century.”	As	more	things	become	digitalized,	data	analysis becomes	an	increasingly	important	skill.  18.	Presentation	Skills:	One	important	business	skill	that	is	not  likely	to	change	in	the	future	is	the	ability	to	speak	and	present	to diverse	groups	of	people.	Those	who	can	master	this	skill	often find	themselves	in	leadership	positions,	both	on	smaller	projects and	on	larger	teams.  19.	Environmental	Intelligence:	As	people	begin	to	consider	the value	of	preserving	resources	over	time,	it	will	be	important	for them	to	understand	how	technology	can	help	make	that	happen. Finding	value	in	our	common	resources	should	be	a	skill	that	is taught	to	students	early	and	often.  20.	Large-scale	Thinking:	As	the	world	becomes	ever	more  connected,	the	ability	to	think	about	and	analyze	large	entities becomes	vital.	While	it	is	important	to	be	able	to	consider	the	small details	of	a	project,	big-picture	thinking	that	accounts	for complexities	and	interwoven	elements	will	be	valuable	and	should be	highly	emphasized	in	the	world	of	education.  21.	Accounting	and	Money	Management:	Not	only	can	basic  accounting	principles	help	people	in	their	personal	lives,	but	it	can also	help	them	to	understand	the	complexities	of	starting,	running, or	participating	in	a	business.  22.	The	Ability	to	Unplug:	As	strange	as	it	may	seem	to	include	this  as	a	business	skill,	consider	the	fact	that	it	is	becoming	harder	to find	places	that	don’t	have	Internet	connections	nowadays.	People who	are	able	to	disconnect	from	their	devices	and	connect	in	more intimate	ways	with	others	will	experience	greater	joy	and	less stress	than	those	who	are	addicted	to	their	devices.  23.	Spotting	Trends:	In	a	rapidly	changing	world,	being	able	to recognize	the	signals	of	potential	opportunities	in	the	future	is immensely	helpful.	Not	only	is	this	skill	accessible	to	people	of	all backgrounds,	but	it	can	also	help	entrepreneurs	to	take	advantage   of	business	ventures,	simply	by	learning	how	to	see	trends	and take	action	at	the	right	time.  24.	Design	Thinking	and	Design	Mindset:	In	the	future	we	will  have	products	and	services	that	we	cannot	even	imagine	today. Design	mindset	is	a	solution-focused	approach	where	you	find desired	solutions	to	complex	problems.	This	is	a	skill	that everyone	can	learn	and	will	be	increasingly	valuable	in	the	future.  In	addition	to	helping	you	get	or	keep	a	job,	the	skills	listed	above	are particularly	useful	if	you	are	interested	in	developing	your	own	business in	the	future.  Figure	5.6.	below	showcases	some	of	the	skills	covered	above,	while also	adding	in	some	additional	skills	that	will	be	important	in	the	future. These	are	separated	out	into	four	different	sections:   	Technical	Skills	Related	to	AI	and	Blockchain:	Technical	skills that	relate	to	deep	learning,	machine	learning,	robotics	and	data science	will	be	in	high	demand	over	the	next	few	years.	There	will also	be	an	increasing	demand	for	engineers	to	work	in	the	self- driving	car	industry	and	programmers	who	can	do	cryptocurrency and	blockchain	work.   	Social	Intelligence	Skills:	We	will	also	see	a	rise	in	demand	for skills	that	relate	to	helping	others,	including	consulting,	retraining and	coaching.	Empathy	and	emotional	intelligence	will	become more	valuable	job	skills	in	the	future.   	A	Creativity	Mindset:	This	includes	the	ability	to	create	something from	the	ground	up,	in	addition	to	skills	related	to	design.	Having	a creative	mindset	can	help	with	personal	branding	and	professional self-promotion,	which	are	essential	for	individuals	who	want	to	set themselves	apart	and	get	noticed	in	a	crowded	job	market.   	Learning	How	to	Learn:	This	category	includes	skills	like	self-  awareness	and	the	ability	to	learn	something	at	a	faster	pace	than others,	in	addition	to	“unlearning”	bad	habits	or	outdated	practices. The	Future	of	Life	Institute	has	identified	two	particularly	interesting   examples	of	such	skills.	The	first	is	known	as	computational	sense- making,	which	refers	to	the	ability	to	understand	machine	and human-based	work.	The	second,	contextualized	intelligence,	refers to	the	ability	to	derive	meaning	from	surrounding	cultures, individuals	and	business	environments,	and	from	society	as	a whole.{126}  	  Figure	5.6.

What	Is	the	Best	Way	to	Hire	Talent	to	Work	with Artificial	Intelligence	Technologies?  One	of	the	questions	I	get	asked	most	frequently	in	my	seminars	and workshops	is	how	entrepreneurs	and	small	businesses	can	start	to	use artificial	intelligence	in	the	projects	they	are	currently	working	on.  Big	tech	companies	like	Google,	Facebook,	Amazon,	Microsoft,	IBM,	and Baidu	are	able	to	employ	some	of	the	best	AI	engineers	in	the	world. However,	there	are	still	plenty	of	opportunities	for	the	rest	of	us	to	work with	skilled	AI	professionals	as	well,	by	hiring	those	who	offer	their services	as	freelancers.  The	practice	of	hiring	freelancers	is	becoming	increasingly	more	popular and	I	highly	recommend	it	for	small	businesses	and	startups,	as	it	can enable	you	to	quickly	access	high-quality	talent	from	all	over	the	world	in a	more	flexible	manner.	In	fact,	it	is	estimated	that	up	to	50	percent	of	the workforce	in	the	U.S.	will	be	comprised	of	freelancers	by	2020.  Before	you	hire	someone	as	a	freelancer,	it	is	important	to	build	a	clear description	of	exactly	what	you	need	to	be	done,	as	well	as	what	type	of person	you	want	to	work	with.  There	are	plenty	of	freelancer	websites	you	can	use	to	find	qualified candidates,	but	by	far,	my	favorite	is	Upwork,	which	can	be	accessed	at www.upwork.com.	Upwork	is	currently	the	largest	platform	for	freelancers in	the	world,	and	according	to	its	statistics,	freelancers	on	its	site	offer over	3,500	different	kinds	of	skills	and	earn	more	than	$1	billion	each year.{127}  I	have	personally	used	this	site	over	the	last	eight	years	and	find	it extremely	useful.	You	can	find	freelancers	with	all	kinds	of	specialties, including	data	scientists,	machine	learning	experts	and	deep	learning engineers,	available	to	be	hired	for	one-time	or	ongoing	projects.  The	ability	to	work	on	or	with	artificial	intelligence	technologies	is	actually one	of	the	most	highly	sought-after	skills	on	Upwork	currently.	The	figure below	shows	that	as	of	the	third	quarter	of	2017,	the	Quarterly	Skills   Index	placed	robotics	as	Upwork’s	fastest-growing	skill,	with	deep learning	at	number	eight,	and	natural	language	processing	and	machine learning	in	the	top	20.	Each	of	these	skills	directly	relates	to	artificial intelligence,	demonstrating	how	popular	this	kind	of	technology	is becoming.{128}  	  Figure	5.7.	20	Fastest-Growing	Skills	for	Freelancers	in	Q3	2017   Upwork   	  According	to	Stephane	Kasriel,	CEO	of	Upwork,	artificial	intelligence	is creating	incredible	opportunities	for	companies	that	hire	talent	through sites	like	Upwork,	stating:  “It’s	much	easier	to	see	when	jobs	go	away	than	it	is	to	envision	the	jobs that	will	be	created,	but	our	data	clearly	shows	that	businesses	are embracing	AI	and	that	it’s	creating	enormous	opportunity.”{129}  To	learn	more	about	hiring	professionals	through	Upwork,	or	to	set	up	a project	on	the	site,	I	suggest	reviewing	this	article	from	its	help	center, found	at:   found	at:  www.upwork.com hiring education simple-safe-hiring-upwork,  or	reading	other	useful	articles	on	Upwork’s	blog	at:  https:  www.upwork.com blog   	   49.	Universal	Basic	Income:	Can	it	Help	as	Jobs	Are Automated?  As	experts	consider	the	problem	of	the	many	jobs	that	will	inevitably	be lost	to	automation,	one	possible	solution	that	is	often	debated	is	the option	of	Universal	Basic	Income	 UBI .  Unlike	current	welfare	models	that	require	recipients	to	prove	they	are actively	seeking	employment,	this	model	would	provide	the	same	amount of	money	to	all	citizens,	regardless	of	employment	or	financial	status, with	no	strings	attached.  When	discussing	the	issue	of	universal	basic	income,	one	problem	that often	arises	is	the	fact	that	many	of	the	politicians	who	offer	opinions	on the	matter	don’t	always	have	a	clear	understanding	of	how	drastically	the introduction	of	automation	and	artificial	intelligence	will	change	the	job market.	For	this	reason,	they	have	a	hard	time	imagining	the	number	of people	who	might	suddenly	find	themselves	out	of	work.  Currently,	the	idea	of	universal	basic	income	is	closely	related	to	work,	so it	has	been	generating	heated	political	arguments	from	all	sides. Personally,	I	believe	that	some	form	of	government	subsidies	will probably	need	to	be	offered	to	those	who	will	be	left	without	a	job	in	the coming	years.	However,	it	will	probably	take	many	attempts	and refinements	to	build	a	model	that	truly	works	for	everyone.  UBI	is	already	being	tested	in	countries	such	as	Finland,	Canada	and Kenya	as	a	way	to	help	individuals	and	societies	adjust	to	the	new	digital economy	where	automation	has	been	taking	over	and	human employment	has	been	dwindling.  In	Finland,	the	program	provides	over	560	euros	 approximately	661 USD 	per	month	to	participants.	This	basic	income	allows	individuals	to take	part-time	employment	or	even	pursue	their	own	business	ideas	by giving	them	a	base	amount	with	which	to	buy	necessities.	Also,	this amount	is	distributed	regardless	of	whether	the	recipients	work	or	not.   As	of	the	time	of	this	writing,	the	program	in	Finland	has	been	running	for several	months	with	about	2,000	participants	between	the	ages	of	25	and 58.	Some	of	those	receiving	the	income	have	reported	that	they	feel	less stress	and	are	more	inclined	to	look	for	work	or	to	try	out	their	own business	ideas.	{130}  One	recipient,	Juha	Järvinen,	told	The	Economist	that	the	program	has allowed	him	to	take	more	part-time	work,	which	previously	would	have cost	his	family	their	welfare	payments.{131}  Finland’s	pilot	program	is	the	first	of	its	kind	in	Europe.	It	was	introduced as	a	way	to	handle	Finland’s	unemployment	problem,	which	stands	at around	10	percent.  A	similar	program	has	been	announced	in	Ontario,	Canada.	This	test program	was	introduced	by	the	province’s	leader,	Premier	Kathleen Wynne,	in	an	effort	to	address	the	challenges	of	the	modern	economy. The	program	will	give	thousands	of	dollars	a	year	to	4,000	residents between	the	ages	of	18	and	64,	whether	they	are	married,	single, employed	or	unemployed.{132}  Other	UBI	programs	include	one	operated	by	GiveDirectly,	a	nonprofit organization	that	allows	donors	to	send	money	directly	to	those	who	need it	in	Kenya.	In	addition,	a	group	called	Y	Combinator	in	Oakland, California	started	a	test	research	project	at	the	beginning	of	2017, donating	up	to	$2,000	a	month	to	100	families.	This	test	is	expected	to run	for	between	six	months	and	a	year.  Benefits	of	Universal	Basic	Income  Although	the	pilot	programs	are	quite	new,	some	early	research	has revealed	that	those	who	received	basic	income	have	had	a	decrease	in healthcare	costs,	were	less	likely	to	purchase	alcohol	or	tobacco,	and worked	more.{133}	There	were	also	fewer	incidents	of	domestic	violence and	improvements	in	childcare,	as	well	as	other	positive	changes.  According	to	some	experts,	these	types	of	programs	could	actually	end up	saving	governments	money,	arguing	that	the	exorbitant	amounts previously	spent	on	community	programs	for	the	homeless	would	be   more	wisely	spent	investing	in	a	universal	basic	income	to	be	given directly	to	each	individual	citizen,	regardless	of	their	circumstance.{134}  The	theory	behind	this	idea	was	supported	by	an	experiment	conducted in	London	in	2009.	13	homeless	individuals	were	each	given	a	lump	sum of	£3,000	 about	4,500	USD 	to	spend	as	they	wished	with	no	strings attached.	A	year	later,	11	out	of	the	13	people	were	no	longer	homeless. Some	experts	claim	this	validates	the	argument	that,	given	the opportunity,	most	individuals	will	use	money	that	is	given	to	them	outright to	better	their	situations.  Advocates	of	UBI	claim	that	the	technology	boom	has	been	displacing many	workers	and	a	basic	income	distribution	would	help	individuals	and society	adjust	to	the	new	economy.  At	the	World	Government	Summit	in	Dubai,	Elon	Musk	of	Tesla	explained that	artificial	intelligence,	automation	and	job	displacement	will	mean	that many	people	around	the	world	will	need	a	basic	income	from	their governments	in	order	to	survive.{135}  In	fact,	there	are	numerous	big	name	supporters	of	UBI	in	Silicon	Valley’s tech	industry,	including	Facebook’s	Mark	Zuckerberg.	The	founder	of eBay,	Pierre	Omidyar,	has	announced	that	his	Omidyar	Network	will	be donating	about	$500,000	to	GiveDirectly,	to	provide	a	basic	income	for 6,000	people	in	Kenya	over	the	next	12	years.{136}  One	researcher	in	Finland,	Roope	Mokka,	claims	that	many	of	those	in the	tech	industry	have	been	outspoken	supporters	of	UBI	because	they are	protecting	their	own	businesses.	Mokka	argues	that	there	is	a	fear among	Silicon	Valley’s	tech	giants	that	in	the	future,	AI	advances	will	lead to	greater	wealth	that	will	only	be	in	the	hands	of	investors	and entrepreneurs.	That	in	turn	will	mean	a	shortage	of	average	customers who	can	afford	to	buy	their	products.	However,	a	UBI	would	prevent	that problem	by	putting	money	in	the	hands	of	all	consumers.{137}  To	learn	more	about	universal	basic	income,	you	can	review	articles	at www.basicincome.org ,	a	website	that	provides	insight	into	the	most interesting	news	related	to	the	topic.   	  	  Figure	5.8.	Basic	Income	Earth	Network	website	at  www.basicincome.org.   50.	Universal	Basic	Income:	What	Are	the Challenges?  With	the	rise	of	AI	and	automation	technologies	in	the	workforce,	and	all the	human	workers	who	will	be	displaced	as	a	result,	the	idea	of	a universal	basic	income	has	been	a	real	hot	topic.	This	issue	has	divided the	opinions	of	experts	around	the	world,	and	many	concerns	about implementing	this	practice	have	been	voiced,	including	the	biggest challenge,	which	is	how	governments	would	be	able	to	afford	it.  Economists	estimate	that	for	a	country	the	size	of	the	United	States,	in order	to	pay	every	citizen	a	basic	sum	of	$10,000	per	year,	taxes	would need	to	be	raised	by	nearly	10	percent.{138}  Additionally,	if	20	percent	of	the	human	workforce	lost	their	jobs	through automation,	governments	would	also	lose	the	equivalent	in	taxable income	from	those	workers.	However,	AI	technologies	could	also	help	the governments	themselves	to	run	more	efficiently,	saving	them	money	in administrative	costs.  A	final	concern	is	that	the	workforce	could	be	further	harmed	by	offering	a universal	basic	income,	as	it	may	provide	less	incentive	for	people	to enter	the	workforce	or	to	accept	less	desirable	jobs.  In	2016,	voters	in	Switzerland	rejected	the	proposal	of	a	universal	basic income,	with	fewer	than	25	percent	of	the	voters	supporting	it.	A	key concern	in	this	country	was	its	open	borders,	and	a	fear	that	foreigners may	flood	the	country	seeking	free	money,	according	to	the	BBC.{139}  Another	potential	option	for	governments	seeking	to	ease	the	challenges presented	by	the	changes	in	the	job	market	is	known	as	negative	tax income.	This	would	basically	mean	that	a	government	would	establish	a certain	acceptable	income	level	and	offer	only	those	who	earn	less	than this	amount	what	they	would	need	to	meet	the	base	income	criterion.  Negative	tax	income	models	overcome	some	of	the	challenges	posed	by universal	basic	income,	as	only	citizens	earning	less	than	a	certain amount	would	qualify	to	receive	aid,	creating	less	of	a	financial	burden	on governments.   governments.  Both	universal	basic	income	and	negative	tax	income	models	have benefits	and	drawbacks	that	must	be	considered.	Each	represents	a	shift in	the	ways	that	countries’	governments	would	operate	amid	the	new technologies.  Mokka	argues	that	societies	themselves	will	need	to	change	in	more ways	than	one,	stating,	“Somehow,	we	need	to	be	able	to	convene	both the	automation	of	demeaning	tasks	and	take	into	consideration	the	desire to	work	that	right	now	energizes	politics	like	no	other	idea.”{140}  He	also	points	out	that	work	has	a	purpose	for	the	state	and	for individuals	that	will	need	to	be	redefined	as	technologies	change	the	way we	operate,	saying	that	“Metaphorically	speaking,	basic	income	is	not	an app	to	save	the	industrial	society,	but	it	could	be	the	start	of	a	new operating	system	for	the	post-industrial	society.”{141}  Advocates	of	universal	basic	income	believe	that	it	will	help	individuals adjust	to	the	realities	of	changes	that	arise	in	a	new	economy.	They	also claim	that	it	will	open	doors	for	people	to	become	entrepreneurs, therefore	boosting	the	economy	even	further.  However,	there	are	still	many	opponents	of	these	practices,	who	are concerned	about	the	financial	viability	of	UBI	and	its	potential	to	harm	the economy	by	negatively	impacting	the	willingness	of	individuals	to	work.  Because	those	on	both	sides	of	the	issue	hold	strong	views,	as	well	as the	fact	that	any	existing	programs	are	still	in	testing,	it	may	be	many years	before	we	see	a	UBI	program	fully	in	place.   CHAPTER	VI  SELF-DRIVING	CARS	AND	HOW	THEY	WILL  CHANGE	TRAFFIC	AS	WE	KNOW	IT  	  	  Figure	6.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	VI.   51.	What	Are	Autonomous	Vehicles	and	Self-Driving Cars? Amid	all	the	latest	advancements	in	artificial	intelligence,	one	of	the technologies	with	the	greatest	potential	to	impact	our	daily	lives,	the economy,	and	society	as	a	whole,	is	that	of	self-driving	cars.  Do	you	know	what	an	autonomous	vehicle	is?  Autonomous	vehicles	can	include	cars,	as	well	as	ships	and	planes.	Also known	as	driverless	cars,	self-driving	cars,	or	automated	cars,	these vehicles	are	created	to	be	able	to	go	from	one	location	to	the	next	without any	input	from	a	human	operator.{142}	.  Currently,	all	cars	that	offer	some	form	of	self-driving	ability	still	rely	on humans	to	be	able	to	take	over	at	the	steering	wheel	if	necessary. However,	in	the	future,	autonomous	cars	will	probably	not	even	have steering	wheels,	turning	each	of	the	vehicles’	occupants	into	passengers, allowing	them	plenty	of	time	to	do	what	they	wish	during	the	ride.  Although	it	may	be	hard	to	imagine	“driving”	without	ever	needing	to	be	in control	of	your	car,	this	idea	is	well	on	its	way	to	becoming	a	reality,	and with	it	will	come	enormous	implications	for	our	day-to-day	lives.  	   Figure	6.2.	Self-Driving	Car.  	   52.	What	Are	the	Biggest	Benefits	of	Self-Driving Cars?  There	will	probably	be	more	benefits	to	self-driving	vehicles	in	the	future than	we	can	even	imagine	now.	Here	are	some	of	the	key	benefits	that we	can	expect:   	Greater	Safety	on	the	Streets:	According	to	recent	statistics,  between	1.2	and	1.4	million	people	die	in	car	accidents	every	year around	the	world.	Worrying	about	drunk	drivers	and	drivers distracted	by	their	cell	phones	will	no	longer	be	an	issue	with autonomous	cars.	With	the	car’s	computers	monitoring	its surroundings,	the	streets	will	be	safer	not	only	for	that	car’s occupants,	but	for	pedestrians,	cyclists,	and	other	drivers	and passengers	as	well.   	Decreased	Hospital	Expenses:	With	fewer	car	accidents,	we	will  also	see	a	reduction	in	hospital	expenses	from	the	decrease	in injuries	caused	by	these	accidents.	Within	the	U.S.	alone,	the	total cost	associated	with	roadway	crashes	in	2012	was	$212	billion.{143} .   	Increased	Productivity:	Because	the	car	will	be	responsible	for	all  the	driving	and	navigational	duties,	everyone	in	the	car	can	work, play	or	study	during	their	trip.	This	will	impact	businesses,	whose workers	will	gain	back	time	previously	lost	to	commuting,	as	well	as individuals,	who	can	enjoy	spending	personal	time	between destinations.   	Faster	Distribution	for	Businesses:	With	navigational	systems  that	can	determine	the	quickest	routes	and	calculate	updates	along the	way,	deliveries	can	be	made	more	efficiently,	positively impacting	individual	businesses	and	the	overall	economy.   	Improved	Traffic	Efficiency:	Because	autonomous	cars	will	not have	the	improper	driving	habits	of	humans,	there	will	be	better traffic	flow	and	less	congestion.	An	additional	advantage	of	this	will be	that	police	officers	will	not	need	to	focus	nearly	as	much	on   traffic-related	accidents,	incidents	or	tickets,	leaving	them	more time	to	spend	on	other	important	law	enforcement	issues.   	Fewer	Parking	Problems:	Because	self-driving	car	services	will	be  able	to	pick	up	and	drop	off	passengers,	operating	around	the clock,	fewer	parking	lots	will	be	needed,	allowing	more	space	to	be used	for	other	purposes	such	as	commercial	and	residential buildings.	In	many	countries,	a	large	amount	of	space	is	designated for	parking	lots.	For	example,	according	to	current	estimates,	there are	nearly	2	billion	parking	spaces	in	the	United	States.{144}	.   	Cheaper	Mobility	Options:	Using	self-driving	car	services	will  make	it	more	affordable	for	people	to	get	where	they	need	to	go,	as fewer	people	will	need	to	own	or	lease	cars,	thereby	eliminating	the need	for	them	to	pay	for	car	insurance,	fuel,	or	repairs.	Already,	it	is estimated	that	self-driving	taxis	would	be	roughly	60	percent	less expensive	than	current	taxi	fares,	because	no	taxi	drivers	would	be needed.   	Fewer	Negative	Environmental	Impacts:	Many	of	the	self-driving cars	will	run	on	renewable	energy	sources	or	electricity,	which	will result	in	the	emission	of	fewer	climate	and	health	damaging	gases like	carbon	dioxide	and	nitrogen	oxide.	Also,	since	self-driving	cars will	always	go	from	point	A	to	point	B	using	the	most	efficient	route possible,	they	will	require	less	fuel	 regardless	of	which	type	of	fuel is	being	used 	than	human	drivers,	thus	cutting	down	on	overall energy	consumption.  These	are	just	a	few	examples	of	the	kinds	of	positive	changes	we	can expect	to	experience	as	self-driving	cars	become	more	prominent	and available.  	   Figure	6.3.	Self-Driving	Car	Parking.  	   53.	What	Are	the	Potential	Challenges	with	Self- Driving	Cars?  Traditionally,	cars	have	played	an	important	role	in	the	design considerations	for	major	cities,	including	details	such	as	the	building	of roads,	and	the	design	and	placement	of	parking	lots.	Cars	have	also traditionally	played	a	crucial	role	in	the	ability	of	people	to	get	around	as, in	the	past,	most	people’s	ability	to	be	mobile	has	been	dependent	on their	personal	vehicles.  All	of	that	will	likely	change	as	self-driving	cars	become	more	popular.	As mentioned	earlier,	these	autonomous	cars	will	offer	many	benefits, including	safer	roads	and	reduced	health	costs.  However,	moving	forward,	there	are	also	some	daunting	challenges	that will	need	to	be	tackled	by	governments	and	scientists,	which	include	the following:   	Data	Security:	Self-driving	cars	will	depend	in	large	part	on	the  data	that	can	be	collected	and	used	to	optimize	their	performance. This	raises	numerous	privacy	and	security	concerns	that	will	need to	be	addressed.  A	report	developed	by	Intel	and	Strategy	Analytics	called Accelerating	the	Future:	The	Economic	Impact	of	the	Emerging Passenger	Economy	describes	the	situation	in	the	following	way:  “The	‘who,	what,	where	and	when’	of	our	lives	will	be	captured	and stored.	The	points	of	entry	will	cover	our	smartphones,	our vehicles,	our	credit	cards,	and	potentially	a	number	of	sensory inputs	tied	to	personal	security	and	biometrics.	Firms	without rigorous	data	security	measures	and	vigilance	will	quickly	face consumer	and	regulatory	backlash.”{145}  Governments	at	the	national	and	regional	levels	should	start considering	the	guidelines	that	should	be	in	place	now,	while	the technologies	are	still	relatively	new,	to	ensure	that	self-driving	cars can	be	utilized	in	a	manner	that	protects	consumer	privacy.    	Unexpected	Situations:	It	will	be	complicated	for	self-driving	cars  to	be	programmed	to	correctly	interpret	and	respond	to	every possible	scenario,	such	as	being	waved	down	by	a	pedestrian,	or detecting	an	unfamiliar	object	in	the	roadway.{146}	.   	Ethical	Issues:	With	ethical	challenges	in	mind,	researchers	at	the  Massachusetts	Institute	of	Technology	 MIT 	designed	what	they call	the	“Moral	Machine,”	which	allows	people	to	see	what	they might	do	in	certain	situations	that	could	happen	with	a	self-driving car,	like	in	the	event	of	the	death	of	a	passenger	or	hitting	a pedestrian.	Part	of	the	reason	why	this	tool	is	so	interesting	is because	it	showcases	the	kinds	of	moral	dilemmas	we	could	be faced	with	while	using	a	self-driving	car.  You	can	view	this	tool	here:	http:  moralmachine.mit.edu  	  Figure	6.4.	Moral	Machine	by	MIT	at:  http:  moralmachine.mit.edu  	    	Adapting	to	Weather	Conditions:	Self-driving	cars	will	need	to	be  able	to	quickly	shift	the	way	they	operate	in	response	to	changing weather	patterns,	such	as	falling	hailstones	or	slippery	roads	due	to heavy	rain.	According	to	John	Leonard,	a	roboticist	at	MIT,	snow	is a	particularly	difficult	condition	for	self-driving	car	sensors	to recognize,	a	problem	that	is	currently	being	worked	on	by	several experts	in	the	field.{147}	.  These	are	just	a	few	of	the	challenges	and	issues	that	companies, individuals	and	governments	will	need	to	consider	as	self-driving	cars become	more	widely	available.	Perhaps	the	toughest	challenge	of	all	will be	convincing	the	public	to	understand	and	accept	that	self-driving	cars are	safer	than	traditional	vehicles.  Personally,	I	believe	that	politicians	and	world	leaders	will	need	to	be educated	about	the	benefits	and	challenges	surrounding	self-driving	cars, so	that	they	can	be	better	prepared	to	lead	legislatively,	creating solutions	for	potential	problems	before	these	kinds	of	cars	enter	the market	on	a	large	scale.  	   54.	What	Are	the	Different	Levels	of	Self-Driving	Car Technologies?  At	the	time	of	this	writing,	there	is	still	a	long	way	to	go	for	companies	to develop	driverless	cars	that	can	travel	between	locations	without	any human	input	or	intervention.  To	better	explain	this	process,	SAE	International	 a	global	association	of engineers	and	related	technical	experts	in	the	aerospace,	automotive	and commercial	vehicle	industries 	has	developed	a	list	of	six	levels	of automation	that	will	need	to	occur	for	cars	to	be	able	to	be	used	without	a human	driver.	This	list	can	help	people	to	understand	the	incremental development	process	necessary	to	achieve	fully	autonomous	vehicles.  Within	the	first	three	levels,	human	drivers	are	required	to	monitor	the driving	environment,	while	in	the	final	three	levels,	the	automatic	driving system	takes	over	this	task.  Here	are	the	levels,	as	laid	out	by	SAE:   	0	-	No	Automation:	At	this	level,	the	human	driver	maintains	100  percent	control,	performing	all	tasks,	even	when	receiving warnings	from	car	systems.   	1	-	Driver	Assistance:	At	Level	1,	small	and	specific	functions,	like  steering,	can	be	done	automatically	by	the	car,	but	all	other functions	are	under	human	control.   	2	-	Partial	Automation:	At	Level	2,	the	human	driver	is	still  responsible	for	primary	tasks,	but	the	assistance	system	in	the car	can	help	with	some	elements	of	the	driving	experience,	like acceleration	or	deceleration,	by	using	information	detected about	the	driving	environment.	A	driver	is	still	required	to	be ready	and	able	to	take	control	at	any	point.	Tesla’s	Autopilot	has remained	at	this	level	since	2014.   	3	-	Conditional	Automation:	At	Level	3,	the	car	can	drive	under  most	conditions,	even	performing	tasks	like	changing	lanes,	but   can	also	ask	the	driver	to	take	control	as	needed.	The	driver may	also	choose	to	intervene	at	any	time,	but	is	not	required	to monitor	the	environment	in	the	same	way	that	they	would	in	the earlier	three	phases.   	4	-	High	Automation:	At	Level	4,	the	car	has	the	ability	to	drive	in nearly	any	situation	without	human	input.	Cars	at	this	level	can be	programmed	not	to	drive	in	severe	weather	conditions. Google’s	self-driving	cars	have	been	test-driving	at	this	level.  	5	-	Full	Automation:	At	Level	5,	vehicles	use	a	fully	automated  system	that	can	handle	even	the	most	difficult	conditions	without any	human	intervention.{148}	{149}	{150}  	  Figure	6.5.	Levels	of	Autonomous	Driving.  	  Manufacturers	of	self-driving	cars	are	competitively	racing	to	get	their vehicles	to	Level	4	or	5,	since	the	first	ones	to	achieve	these	levels	will be	able	to	grab	a	higher	portion	of	the	market.   However,	the	success	of	any	company’s	vehicles	will	depend	not	only	on the	capabilities	of	their	technologies,	but	also	on	the	legislation	in	place and	the	readiness	of	the	cities	where	they	are	implemented	to accommodate	autonomous	cars,	as	we’ll	discuss	in	a	later	section	of	this chapter.  	   55.	What	Makes	Self-Driving	Cars	Possible?  There	is	a	tremendous	amount	of	advanced	technology	that	goes	into	the development	of	self-driving	cars.	The	process	is	extremely	complex, which	is	one	of	the	reasons	why	it	takes	so	long	to	create	such	a	vehicle. In	fact,	it	can	take	many	years	to	get	the	design	right.  Regardless	of	the	time	it	takes	to	build	a	self-driving	vehicle,	it	is	vitally important	for	cities	all	over	the	world	to	start	preparing	now	for	the eventuality	that	they	will	someday	be	on	the	road.  Here	are	some	of	the	specific	details	about	the	technology	involved	in	the creation	of	self-driving	cars,	as	well	as	what	makes	these	vehicles	so unique	and	capable	of	driving	unaided	on	the	streets.  According	to	McKinsey	&	Company,	there	are	10	elements	that	make	a self-driving	car	possible.	These	include:   	Actuation:	This	refers	to	the	creation	of	the	steering,	braking	and  acceleration	elements.   	Cloud:	Self-driving	vehicles	will	navigate	with	the	help	of	maps,  traffic	data	and	algorithms,	and	will	therefore	need	to	be	connected to	the	cloud.   	Perception	and	Object	Analysis:	Since	these	vehicles	will	need	to be	able	to	detect	and	maneuver	around	obstacles,	this	is	one	of	the most	important	elements	that	needs	to	be	developed.   	Drive	Control:	For	the	car	to	be	able	to	move,	it	will	need	to  convert	the	algorithm	output	into	a	drive	signal.   	Decision	Making:	This	is	simply	the	vehicle’s	ability	to	plan	its	own  route	and	the	maneuvers	required	to	arrive	at	its	destination.   	Localization	and	Mapping:	To	safely	operate	on	roadways,	a	self-  driving	car	must	be	able	to	put	together	data,	which	will	include environmental	information,	mapping,	and	vehicle	localization.    	Analytics:	A	self-driving	vehicle	will	also	be	able	to	detect	problems  within	its	own	system.	These	will	include	design	flaws	and	repair recommendations.   	Middleware	or	Operating	System:	This	is	the	software	needed	to  run	the	algorithms	and	is	essential	to	proper	functioning	of	the vehicle.   	Computer	Hardware:	Developers	have	been	working	on	a	high-  performance	system	with	low	power	consumption	for	these vehicles,	which	they	have	been	able	to	produce	as	a	system	on	a chip	 SOC .   	Sensors:	Detecting	obstacles	is	a	crucial	function	of	a	self-driving  vehicle,	and	as	such	there	will	need	to	be	many	sensors incorporated	into	the	design.	These	will	include	lidar,	sonar,	radar, and	cameras.{151}  	  Figure	6.6.	How	Self-Driving	Car	Sees	the	Road	-	NVIDIA	Self-Driving  Car	Demo	at	CES	2017.	 https: youtu.be fmVWLr0X1Sk .  	   While	the	idea	of	a	self-driving	car	has	been	around	for	many	years, turning	it	into	a	reality	takes	a	very	long	time.	It	requires	sophisticated technology	to	develop	all	the	important	elements	necessary	to	produce	a practical	automobile	that	can	function	safely	on	the	road.  Despite	a	long	development	process,	it	is	essential	that	countries	and cities	begin	to	prepare	now	for	the	inevitability	of	self-driving	cars	on	the roads	in	the	near	future.  	   56.	When	Will	Self-Driving	Cars	Be	Ready	to	Hit	the Streets?  With	all	the	buzz	around	autonomous	cars,	you	might	be	curious	as	to when	you’ll	be	able	to	purchase	one	for	yourself.	This	is	a	difficult question	to	answer,	as	the	release	of	these	kinds	of	cars	for	consumer use	is	limited	by	several	factors,	including	tests	by	the	carmakers	to ensure	that	the	vehicles	manufactured	are	safe.  Here	are	the	most	current	estimated	timelines	for	the	release	of	self- driving	cars,	as	predicted	by	different	manufacturers:   	Tesla:	Tesla	is	currently	on	the	forefront	of	the	technology	behind  self-driving	cars.	Elon	Musk,	the	CEO	and	co-founder	of	Tesla, estimates	that	by	the	year	2019,	his	company	will	be	able	to produce	Level	4	self-driving	cars	that	will	be	able	to	operate	without input	from	a	human	driver.{152}   	Audi	and	Nvidia:	These	companies	believe	that	they	will	be	able	to  have	autonomous	vehicles	on	the	market	by	2020.{153}	.	Audi	also estimates	that	it	will	launch	Level	3	autonomous	cars	by	2018, while	Nvidia	says	its	self-driving	car	computer	systems	will	be ready	by	the	end	of	the	year	2018.   	Ford:	Even	the	oldest	carmaker	in	the	world,	Ford,	is	participating  in	autonomous	vehicle	technologies	and	predicts	that	its	self-driving vehicles	will	be	ready	for	consumers	by	2021.{154}   	Volvo:	This	company	believes	it	will	have	its	first	models	of  autonomous	vehicles	on	the	road	by	2021.	Volvo	is	also	running	a large	autonomous	driving	project	called	“Drive	Me,”	which	was designed	to	test	its	self-driving	vehicles	using	human	drivers	in Gothenburg,	Sweden.{155} If	you	are	interested	in	participating	in	these	tests,	you	can	send	in your	application	here: https:  securewww.volvocars.com intl about our-innovation- brands intellisafe autonomous-driving drive-me drive-me-form    	Honda:	By	its	own	estimates,	Honda	will	likely	be	one	of	the	slower  carmakers	to	get	driverless	vehicles	on	the	road.	It	currently expects	to	have	Level	4	autonomous	cars	available	by	2025,	but	is seeking	to	be	able	to	release	these	cars	at	an	affordable	price	of just	$20,000.{156}   	Waymo:	This	is	Google’s	self-driving	car	project,	which	has	already  logged	over	3	million	miles	on	public	roads.	As	of	this	time, information	has	not	been	released	regarding	an	exact	date	for	the use	of	this	technology	or	which	carmakers	it	will	be	used	with.{157}  While	you	may	think	that	Tesla	and	Google	would	be	the	primary	leaders in	self-driving	car	technologies,	simply	based	on	their	own	estimates,	a study	conducted	by	Navigant	Research	has	revealed	that,	surprisingly, the	current	leaders	are	Ford	and	General	Motors,	followed	by	Renault- Nissan	Alliance	and	Daimler.	This	is	good	news	for	traditional	car manufacturers.{158}  This	same	study	placed	Google’s	project,	Waymo,	at	6th	place	and	Tesla at	12th	place.  The	criteria	used	for	this	study	included	factors	such	as	the	go-to-market strategies,	production	competence,	technology,	staying	power,	sales, marketing,	and	distribution.{159}  	   Figure:	6.7.	Results	of	the	Self-Driving	Car	Study	Conducted	by	Navigant  Research.	 Image	Credit:	www.navigantresearch.com .  	  Meanwhile,	the	transportation	network	company	Lyft	has	announced	that the	majority	of	its	rides	will	be	offered	through	self-driving	cars	by	2021. Lyft	has	made	a	strategic	partnership	with	General	Motors	and NuTonomy,	a	company	that	makes	a	version	of	software	that	serves	self- driving	cars.	Lyft’s	main	competitor,	Uber,	has	also	embraced	new technologies	and	has	already	begun	to	test	self-driving	cars	in	Pittsburgh and	Arizona.{160}  Most	likely,	self-driving	cars	will	be	introduced	to	the	public	roads	in stages,	using	various	levels	of	the	technology	under	tightly	controlled   stages,	using	various	levels	of	the	technology	under	tightly	controlled conditions	in	limited	locations.	However,	they	will	probably	come	sooner than	we	may	expect,	bringing	about	huge	changes	to	cities,	job	markets and	services,	as	we’ll	discuss	in	a	later	section	of	this	book.  Business	Insider	estimates	that	by	2020,	there	will	be	over	10	million	self- driving	cars	on	the	roads,	but	full	adoption	of	self-driving	technologies	will probably	take	place	by	roughly	2030.{161}  	   57.	Which	Countries	and	Cities	Will	Be	First	to	Test Self-Driving	Vehicles?  In	their	insightful	book	on	autonomous	vehicles	entitled	Driverless: Intelligent	Cars	and	the	Road	Ahead,	authors	Hod	Lipson	and	Melba Kurman	point	out	that	self-driving	cars	will	first	be	used	in	specific	areas, saying:  “The	first	autonomous	vehicles	will	appear	in	special	environments	before they	appear	on	mainstream	roads.	Mines	and	farms	already	use autonomous	vehicles.	Freight	trucking	will	likely	also	be	an	early	adopter. In	cities,	at	first,	driverless-car	adoption	will	be	cautious,	taking	the	form of	low-speed	shuttles	that	drive	slowly	in	enclosed	and	structured environments	such	as	airports	or	resorts.”  Below,	we’ll	explore	a	few	of	the	places	that	have	already	begun	to implement	driverless	car	technologies	and	tests.  Finland	and	the	Driverless	Robot	Bus  The	testing	of	slow-speed,	self-driving	shuttles	has	already	begun	in Finland,	my	home	country,	as	of	2016.	One	of	the	primary	reasons	why Finland	is	a	pioneer	of	autonomous	vehicle	technologies	is	because	it	is legal	to	operate	driverless	vehicles	in	real	traffic	situations	in	that	country.  Finland	was	also	one	of	the	first	countries	to	adopt	the	mindset	that	self- driving	vehicles	should	first	serve	public	transportation,	rather	than individual	cars.	This	belief	makes	sense	when	you	consider	the	concerns of	city	planning,	public	safety,	traffic	congestion	levels,	and	the environmental	benefits	offered	by	this	technology.  The	company	behind	the	original	robot	bus	test	project	is	called	Sohjoa. Harri	Santamala,	a	project	director	for	the	company,	who	is	also	a director	of	the	Smart	Mobility	program	at	Helsinki	Metropolia	University	of Applied	Sciences,	shared	a	brief	description	of	the	bus:  “These	small	robot	busses	are	programmed	to	drive	a	certain	route, which	differs	from	what	big	car	companies	are	developing,	which	is	self-   driving	cars	that	can	go	anywhere	and	with	whoever	is	driving	them.”{162}  In	early	tests,	the	speed	of	these	busses	was	set	to	11	km	 about	7 miles 	per	hour.  Similar	forms	of	robot	busses	are	expected	to	begin	testing	soon	in Norway.	Norwegians	are	currently	the	world	leaders	in	the	purchase	of electric	vehicles	and	represent	one	of	the	largest	markets	for	companies like	Tesla.{163}  Singapore	and	San	Francisco	Offering	Rides	in	Self-Driving	Taxis  Singapore	was	the	first	country	to	introduce	self-driving	taxis	in	2016. These	taxis	were	operated	by	NuTonomy,	a	technology	startup	that creates	the	software	needed	for	self-driving	cars	to	run,	allowing consumers	to	order	a	ride	in	one	of	its	taxis	from	a	smartphone	app.  So	far,	the	tests	have	resulted	in	one	minor	incident	in	which	a	single	car collided	with	a	truck,	but	there	have	been	no	injuries.{164}  General	Motors	is	running	a	similar	test	program	in	San	Francisco,	in which	it	allows	some	of	its	employees	to	use	self-driving	cars	for	rides	at no	cost.	This	is	a	clever	idea	for	testing,	as	the	employees’	technical knowledge	enables	them	to	provide	valuable	feedback,	and	their employee	status	makes	them	less	likely	than	“civilians”	to	mention	any technical	flaws	on	social	media,	which	could	negatively	influence	public opinion	before	the	technology	is	complete.{165}  In	the	future,	we	can	expect	to	see	more	cities	and	countries	participating in	test	programs	for	driverless	public	transportation	systems	as	well.  	   58.	What	Will	Be	Changed	by	Autonomous	Vehicles?  In	reality,	everything	that	transports	people	or	things	will	probably	be autonomous	and	driverless	very	soon.	The	advancements	in	artificial intelligence	technologies	will	be	used	to	assist	all	types	of	vehicles	to become	self-driving.	Along	with	cars,	there	will	be	a	full	range	of	other vehicles	that	will	be	able	to	go	from	point	A	to	point	B	without	a	human operator.  Here	is	just	a	short	list	of	some	of	the	vehicles	that	will	be	autonomous	in the	future:  Ships  Tractors  Autonomous	shipping	vessels	will	be	a	huge	advancement	for	the international	shipping	industry.	In	Norway,	they	have	already	developed the	first	environmentally	friendly,	self-driving	ship	–	one	that	has	zero emissions	and	can	go	from	point	A	to	point	B	without	assistance.{166}  The	Yara	Birkeland,	which	runs	on	battery	power,	is	set	to	begin	working in	2018,	transporting	fertilizer	to	a	production	plant.  This	autonomous	ship	navigates	by	using	a	GPS	system,	radar,	camera and	sensors.	It	will	also	have	electric	cranes	to	help	it	with	loading	and unloading.  Japan	is	one	of	the	countries	that	is	the	most	advanced	in	this	area	and	it will	soon	be	collecting	crops	with	the	help	of	autonomous	tractors.  With	government	support,	self-driving	tractors	have	been	developed	to make	farming	in	the	country	easier.	In	an	effort	to	encourage	the	creation of	such	machines,	Japan’s	Ministry	of	Agriculture	has	established	safety standards.	Media	reports	indicate	that	the	driverless	tractors	could	be fully	operational	by	2020.{167}  These	tractors	will	maneuver	by	using	GPS	and	satellites	to	help	them identify	their	exact	locations.	The	trial	versions,	which	were	released	in June	of	2017,	have	been	priced	at	about	50	percent	higher	than	current   June	of	2017,	have	been	priced	at	about	50	percent	higher	than	current traditional	tractors.  A	full	range	of	self-driving	tractors	is	expected	to	be	released	in	Japan	as early	as	2018,	when	a	new	satellite	becomes	operational.  Airplanes  This	will	be	the	most	significant	development,	considering	that	about	3.8 billion	people	travel	on	airplanes	every	year.	It	is	also	a	change	that	will likely	take	the	longest	adjustment	time	for	passengers,	as	many	people may	be	hesitant	to	board	a	plane	without	a	pilot.{168}  The	advancements	in	computer	systems	and	artificial	intelligence	will	be used	to	assist	in	the	takeoff	and	landing	of	these	autonomous	airplanes.  Boeing	has	announced	that	it	has	been	looking	to	test	pilotless	airplanes in	response	to	the	increasing	numbers	of	travelers	and	decreasing numbers	of	pilots.	It	expects	to	begin	testing	in	the	summer	of	2018.{169}  Would	you	be	willing	to	fly	in	a	plane	without	a	pilot?	I	don’t	think	I	would!  Helicopters  Dubai	was	the	first	city	to	test	pilotless	helicopter	taxis	as	a	way	to	beat backed-up	traffic.	Regardless	of	a	lack	of	guidelines	or	regulations,	Dubai was	apparently	determined	to	be	the	first	city	to	test	autonomous helicopters,	with	the	Dubai	Roads	and	Transit	Authority	indicating	that	it would	still	push	ahead.	In	this	effort,	Dubai’s	government	has	agreed	to let	German	startup	Volocopter	run	tests	there	in	late	2017.{170}  The	helicopter	itself	is	about	2	meters	 6.5	feet 	tall	with	a	diameter	of	7 meters	 23	feet .	Autonomous	air	taxis	 AAT 	have	been	reported	to	be able	to	cruise	for	30	minutes	at	a	speed	of	50	km	 	about	31	miles 	per hour.{171}  As	with	airplanes,	it	will	be	interesting	to	learn	how	hesitant	passengers will	be	to	board	these	self-flying	air	taxis.	It	is	likely	that	not	many	people would	want	to	be	the	test	passengers	to	find	out	if	these	pilotless helicopters	are	safe	or	not.   Delivery	Drones  Could	you	imagine	placing	an	order	online	and	having	it	delivered	within minutes?	Drones	have	been	predicted	to	be	the	future	of	shopping	and shipping.  E-commerce	giant	Amazon	has	shown	a	great	interest	in	the development	of	drones	for	shipping.	When	the	machines	work	properly they	can	help	reduce	shipping	costs,	as	well	as	the	time	it	takes	for delivery	in	urban	areas.{172}  In	tests	done	by	Amazon	in	2016,	it	took	less	than	15	minutes	for	a	drone to	deliver	an	order	that	would	otherwise	take	at	least	a	few	hours,	or	even a	few	days.	The	cost	savings	for	both	the	company	and	the	customer have	been	the	primary	motivations	behind	Amazon’s	attempted	adoption of	the	use	of	drones.{173}  In	fact,	Domino’s	Pizza	proved	that	deliveries	could	be	made	with	drones in	November	of	2016,	when	it	successfully	used	a	drone	to	deliver	a customer’s	order	in	New	Zealand.  However,	experts	have	stated	that	they	believe	mass	adoption	of	drone delivery	will	be	held	back	by	regulatory	barriers,	technical	issues	and customer	preference.	It	has	been	predicted	that	drones	will	become	more common	methods	of	delivery	after	2020.  There	have	also	been	some	ethical	concerns	over	what	kinds	of	data	the drones	will	collect	from	customers’	homes.	One	media	report	claims	that Amazon	may	use	its	drones	to	scan	homes	from	the	air	in	an	effort	to tailor	its	advertising	to	its	customers.{174}  It	may	come	down	to	a	question	of	convenience	versus	privacy.	Another drawback	to	drone	delivery	is	that	a	large	amount	of	people	who	work	in the	package	delivery	industry	will	be	out	of	work.  As	with	self-driving	cars,	the	development	and	testing	of	other autonomous	vehicles	will	also	occur	over	incremental	phases	and	will take	some	time.	This	will	probably	be	a	good	thing	for	most	passengers, as	it	will	give	them	time	to	adjust	to	self-driving	vehicles	gradually,	rather than	all	at	once.   than	all	at	once.  	   59.	What	Are	Some	Common	Self-Driving	Car Terms?  Here	is	some	of	the	common	terminology	used	in	regard	to	self-driving cars.   	Automated	Highway	System	 AHS :	This	is	a	kind	of	intelligent transportation	system	technology	designed	primarily	for	driverless cars.	Also	called	“Smart	Road,”	AHS	will	make	it	possible	for	roads to	be	less	congested	with	traffic.   	Autonomous	Cars:	Fully	autonomous	vehicles	that	can	drive  without	any	human	input	or	intervention.	Typically,	this	means	that the	car	has	no	steering	wheel.	These	cars	will	be	connected	to each	other	wirelessly	and	will	be	able	to	handle	basic	traffic patterns,	including	the	ability	to	navigate	roundabouts	and	interpret traffic	lights	correctly.   	Central	Computer:	This	is	where	all	the	information	collected	by the	sensors	is	analyzed.	The	central	computer	is	also	responsible for	the	steering,	acceleration	and	braking	of	the	vehicle.   	GPS:	GPS,	which	stands	for	Global	Positioning	System,	uses satellites,	tachometers,	altimeters	and	gyroscopes	to	allow	the vehicle’s	location	to	be	pinpointed	to	within	1.9	meters	 about	6 feet .   	Infrared	Camera:	This	camera	picks	up	infrared	beams	that	are  shone	through	the	headlights	to	better	equip	the	self-driving	car	for driving	at	night.   	Lane	Guidance:	Self-driving	vehicles	are	able	to	stay	within	their  own	lanes	through	the	use	of	sophisticated	cameras	located	on	the rearview	mirror.	These	cameras	can	monitor	lane	markings	and differentiate	them	from	the	road	surface.   	Lidar:	Lidar	stands	for	Light	Detection	and	Ranging.	It	consists	of	a laser-based	variation	on	radar	technologies.	A	Lidar-equipped	tool   is	typically	attached	to	the	roof	of	a	vehicle,	providing	it	with uninterrupted,	360-degree	views	of	the	travel	environment.   	Radar:	Radar	systems	are	used	to	detect	any	objects	that	might	be in	the	road.	Radar,	which	stands	for	Radio	Detection	and	Ranging, uses	radio	waves	to	help	self-driving	cars	to	monitor	their surroundings.   	Semi-Autonomous	Cars:	These	are	cars	that	are	somewhat autonomous,	but	can	still	take	or	require	human	input.	Current examples	of	semi-autonomous	cars	include	the	Tesla	Model	S	and the	Mercedes-Benz	E-Class.   	Sensors:	Sensors	can	be	used	to	detect	any	number	of	different factors	that	might	better	enable	a	self-driving	car	to	operate	within its	surroundings.	These	might	include	sensors	for	weather	patterns, road	conditions,	or	the	presence	of	pedestrians	or	obstacles	in	the vehicle’s	path,	among	other	things.   	Stereo	Vision:	This	refers	to	the	two	3D	cameras	on	the	windshield  of	the	self-driving	vehicle	that	help	to	watch	for	obstructions	in	the road	ahead.   	Wheel	Encoders:	These	are	sensors	located	on	the	wheels	of	a  self-driving	vehicle	that	help	track	its	speed	as	it	moves.{175}	{176}	{177} {178}	{179}  	   Figure:	6.8.	How	Self-Driving	Cars	Work.  	   60.	What	Are	Some	Recommended	Resources	to Learn	More	About	Self-Driving	Cars?  There	are	currently	many	resources	from	which	you	can	obtain	more information	about	self-driving	cars.	Here	are	some	of	the	ones	that	I recommend.  Book:  Driverless:	Intelligent	Cars	and	the	Road	Ahead  Written	by	Hod	Lipson	and	Melba	Kurman	and	published	by	MIT	Press, this	book	offers	great	insights	into	the	world	of	self-driving	cars	and surrounding	issues.	It	is	not	very	technical,	so	it	is	an	easy	read	for anyone	interested	in	learning	about	autonomous	vehicle	technologies,	as well	as	their	impacts	on	politics	and	other	areas	of	daily	life. https:  www.amazon.com dp B01K13FURS   Resources	on	the	Impacts	of	Self-Driving	Cars	on	Cities:  If	you	work	for	a	city	or	are	simply	interested	in	the	ways	that	cities	can adapt	to	self-driving	car	technologies,	I	recommend	following	the	Global Initiative	on	Autonomous	Vehicles	for	Cities,	created	by	Bloomberg Philanthropies	and	the	Aspen	Institute.  https:  www.bloomberg.org press releases five-cities-join-bloomberg- philanthropies-aspen-institutes-global-initiative-autonomous-vehicles   Free	Lectures	on	Self-Driving	Cars:  MIT	has	a	great	collection	of	lectures,	PowerPoint	presentations	and guest	talks	in	its	class,	Deep	Learning	for	Self-Driving	Cars.  You	can	access	the	material	for	free	at: http:  selfdrivingcars.mit.edu   I	also	recommend	subscribing	to	and	following	professor	Lex	Fridman’s YouTube	channel	where	he	shares	interesting	lectures	on	self-driving cars:   https:  www.youtube.com user lexfridman videos  Technical	Resources:  If	you	want	to	learn	about	the	technologies	behind	the	creation	of	self- driving	cars,	or	are	interested	in	working	in	the	field	yourself,	Udacity	has an	innovative	curriculum	that	was	developed	with	some	of	the	top	players in	the	companies	creating	autonomous	vehicles.	Sebastian	Thrun,	who founded	Google’s	self-driving	car	program,	is	the	director	of	this	program, which	offers	a	nanodegree. https:  www.udacity.com course self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree-- nd013   ROBOTS	AND	HOW	THEY	WILL	CHANGE	OUR  CHAPTER	VII  LIVES  	  Figure	7.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	VII.  	   In	this	chapter	you’ll	learn	about	developments	in	the	field	of	robotics, and	how	they	will	impact	society	and	the	way	we	do	business	on	a	daily basis.	This	topic	is	expansive	and	cannot	be	covered	comprehensively	in a	single	chapter,	so	I’ve	also	included	a	list	of	recommended	reading	for those	who	would	like	to	delve	deeper	into	particular	themes.  You’ll	also	discover	some	of	the	basic	ethical	issues	that	will	need	to	be addressed	and	how	we	can	prepare	to	adapt	as	robots	become	utilized	in more	significant	ways	within	the	next	few	years.  As	you	read,	keep	in	mind	that	the	purpose	of	robots	is	to	serve humanity,	rather	than	the	other	way	around.	Robots	will	soon	be	an essential	part	of	our	everyday	lives,	both	personally	and	professionally, so	it	is	a	good	idea	to	become	familiar	with	their	potential	uses	and limitations	early	on.  	   61.	What	Is	a	Robot?  Hollywood	has	created	a	myriad	of	movies	that	depict	robots	in	a negative	light,	which	in	turn	has	negatively	affected	many	people’s impressions	about	robots.	However,	in	reality,	robots	and	automated machines	have	little	in	common	with	those	scary	creatures	we	see	on	the silver	screen.	Real	life	robots,	which	are	extremely	complex,	were basically	created	to	help	with	tasks	that	are	too	dangerous	or	difficult	for humans,	and	are	predominantly	used	for	good	rather	than	evil.  Essentially,	a	robot	is	any	machine	that	can	be	programmed	to	carry	out complex	actions.	The	word	robot	stems	from	the	Slavic	word	robota{180}, which	means	forced	laborer.  	   Figure	7.2.	Example	of	a	Robot.  	  The	idea	of	an	intelligent	machine	has	been	around	since	ancient	times, with	many	myths	promoting	the	idea	of	an	artificial	human.	Many	religions feature	such	characters	in	their	tales.  The	first	electronic	autonomous	robots	 or	“modern-day”	robots 	were created	in	Bristol,	England	in	1948	by	William	Grey	Walter.{181}  There	is	general	agreement	that	for	a	machine	to	be	defined	as	a	robot by	today’s	standards,	it	needs	to	meet	the	following	criteria:   	Can	be	electronically	programmed.    	Can	process	data	or	physical	perceptions.  	Can	work	autonomously.  	Can	move	around.  	Can	operate	some	of	its	physical	parts	or	a	process.  	Can	sense,	and	change	according	to,	its	environment.  	Can	show	intelligent	behavior	similar	to	a	human	being’s.  Today’s	robots	are	most	commonly	used	for	industrial	tasks	such	as manufacturing,	but	they	are	becoming	more	and	more	commonplace	for other	purposes	 e.g.,	medical	operating	robots,	dog	therapy	robots .	They are	also	increasingly	being	utilized	for	tasks	that	are	too	dangerous	for humans,	such	as	the	use	of	drones	in	military	situations.  Since	robots	were	originally	created	purely	for	entertainment	purposes, many	of	the	early	ones	were	developed	to	look	like	animals	or	humans. However,	during	the	Industrial	Revolution	these	automated	machines began	to	be	used	for	more	practical	reasons,	for	which	they	no	longer needed	to	look	human.	Today,	robots	have	come	a	long	way	in	both aspects	 their	abilities	to	look	like	humans	or	animals	and	their	practical capabilities .	As	a	result,	there	is	an	enormous	variety	of	robots	with different	combinations	of	functions	and	physical	appearances.  Over	the	last	few	decades,	many	types	of	robots	have	returned	to	being designed	to	increasingly	look	and	act	more	like	humans,	but	they	have not	yet	reached	the	complexity	where	they	can	make	their	own	decisions without	preprograming.  Today	one	of	the	most	widely	recognized	robots	is	the	Roomba,	a	small, circular	vacuum	cleaner	that	can	adjust	to	its	environment	through	built-in sensors.	Over	14	million	Roombas	have	been	sold,	according	to	the	CEO of	iRobot,	the	company	that	makes	the	Roomba.{182}  Roomba	works	at	vacuuming	a	room	based	on	preprogrammed	modes including	spot	mode,	max	mode	and	dock	mode.	Each	mode	instructs	the machine	to	perform	a	specific	task	in	a	specific	way.	For	example,	spot cleaning	mode	causes	the	Roomba	to	clean	a	small	area	by	working	in an	outward-then-inward	spiral	motion.   Roomba	is	also	preprogrammed	with	“reactions”	to	bumping	into	objects, which	causes	it	to	reverse	and	change	paths.  Despite	how	robots	are	portrayed	in	movies,	there	are	many	types	and styles	of	automated	machines,	from	factory	robots	to	companion	ones,	all of	which	are	designed	to	be	helpful	to	humans.  	   62.	How	Many	Robots	Are	There?  Robots	have	become	commonplace	in	many	industries.	In	fact,	the number	of	robots	being	ordered	and	shipped	has	dramatically	increased over	the	last	few	years.  The	Robotics	Industries	Association	 RIA 	has	announced	record- breaking	sales	of	robots	in	early	2017,	with	nearly	10,000	robots	ordered in	North	America	alone.	Those	orders	were	worth	$516	million	for	the robotics	industry.	The	statistics	show	a	32	percent	increase	over	the	first quarter	of	2016.{183}  Shipments	of	robots	have	also	increased,	with	over	8,000	being	sent	to North	American	companies	in	the	first	few	months	of	2017.	That	is	a	24 percent	increase	over	the	first	quarter	of	2016.  The	majority	of	the	robots	ordered	in	early	2017	 53	percent 	were	for	use in	the	automotive	industry.	Robot	orders	for	use	in	other	industries, including	metals,	semiconductors,	electronics,	food,	and	consumer goods,	were	also	behind	the	boost	for	the	robotics	industry.  There	are	now	about	250,000	robots	being	used	in	various	industries	in North	America,	according	to	the	RIA{184}.	It	has	been	estimated	that	there will	be	over	1.4	million	new	robots	being	sent	to	factories	around	the world	by	2019.{185}  Currently	the	European	Union	and	China	are	leading	the	way	with	65 percent	of	EU	countries	having	a	high	average	of	industrial	robots	per 10,000	employees.	However,	China	is	expected	to	reach	40	percent	of the	market	volume	of	industrial	robots	by	2019.  Joe	Gemma,	President	of	the	International	Federation	of	Robotics,	was quoted	as	saying,  “Automation	is	a	central	competitive	factor	for	traditional	manufacturing groups,	but	is	also	becoming	increasingly	important	for	small	and medium-sized	enterprises	around	the	world.”{186}   The	Federation	estimates	that	2.6	million	industrial	robots	will	be deployed	by	2019.	According	to	statistics,	70	percent	of	all	robots	are currently	being	used	in	the	automotive,	electronic,	and	metal	or machinery	industries.{187}	The	robotics	industry	saw	a	record-breaking year	in	2015,	with	254,000	units	sold	globally.  	   63.	What	Types	of	Robots	Are	There?  There	are	many	different	varieties	of	robots	that	have	been	designed	for use	in	the	metal,	electronic	and	automotive	industries,	but	those	are certainly	not	the	only	types	of	robots	that	have	been	created.	There	are	a multitude	of	sizes,	shapes	and	styles	of	robots	that	are	used	for	a	wide array	of	reasons	around	the	world.  For	example,	the	medical	industry	has	been	using	robots	for	numerous purposes	including	surgery,	guided	vehicles	and	lifting	aides.	Robots have	also	been	designed	to	help	out	at	home.	From	vacuum	cleaners	to lawnmowers,	there	are	robots	that	have	been	created	to	perform	various domestic	chores.	There	are	also	military	robots	that	help	with	tasks	such as	bomb	disposal	and	transportation,	as	well	as	robots	for	use	in	law enforcement	environments.	In	addition,	robots	have	been	designed	for children’s	entertainment,	such	as	toy	dinosaurs,	for	hobby competition purposes,	and	for	space	exploration,	such	as	the	Mars	Rovers.  In	addition	to	their	many	purposes,	robots	also	come	in	a	variety	of shapes,	sizes	and	mobility	capabilities.	There	are:   	Stationary	robots,	which	can	include	robotic	arms	with	limited  movement.   	Wheeled	robots.  	Legged	robots.  	Flying	robots.  	Swimming	robots.  Some	of	the	more	fascinating	robots	are	the	ones	that	are	human-shaped that	have	been	designed	as	companions.  One	such	robot,	named	Pepper{188},	has	been	created	to	recognize human	emotions.	This	robot	has	been	used	in	some	stores	in	Japan	and is	considered	a	domestic	companion.	Pepper	has	been	programmed	to recognize	emotions	based	on	facial	expressions,	body	movements	and words	spoken.	The	robot	then	selects	a	behavior	to	react	to	the	emotion it	recognizes.   As	technology	advances,	so	does	the	field	of	robotics,	leading	to	a	vast array	of	sizes,	shapes	and	types	of	automated	machines	–	or	robots. From	assembling	cars	to	assisting	customers	in	stores,	robots	have	been designed	and	programmed	to	perform	tasks	in	many	different	industries including	manufacturing,	the	military,	medicine	and	retail,	just	to	name	a few.  	   64.	Which	Country	Has	the	Most	Robots?  Many	countries	have	large	numbers	of	working	robots,	and	studies	have shown	that	those	countries	with	the	most	robots	have	lower unemployment	rates	than	other	countries.  In	2016	Japan	was	considered	to	be	the	country	with	the	most operational	robots,	according	to	research	done	by	Bank	of	America	and Merrill	Lynch.	At	the	time	the	country	had	310,508	robots{189}.	The	United States	came	in	second	place	with	168,623	operational	robots,	while Germany	took	third	place	with	161,988.  Recently,	South	Korea	was	documented	as	having	the	highest	density	of robots	than	any	other	country	in	the	world,	according	to	one	media	outlet. {190}	In	addition,	the	government	of	South	Korea	announced	that	over	the next	five	years	it	will	invest	$450	million	into	the	robotics	industry.  In	2016	the	International	Federation	of	Robotics	published	a	report	which included	some	interesting	statistics	on	the	number	of	robots	per	100 workers	in	different	countries.	South	Korea	was	number	one	with	5.31 robots	per	100	workers,	while	the	global	average	was	only	0.69	robots per	100	workers.{191}	Figure	7.3.	illustrates	some	other	statistics	revealed in	this	report.  	   Figure	7.3.	Robot-to-Worker	Ratios	are	Growing	Worldwide.  	  In	one	study	researchers	found	a	link	between	robotics	and	economic growth.	They	concluded	that	10	percent	of	GDP	growth	and	16	percent	of productivity	improvements	were	linked	to	the	number	of	robots	in	a country.{192}  While	there	has	been	speculation	that	automation	brings	higher	rates	of unemployment,	that	has	not	always	proven	to	be	true.	One	economic publication	notes	that	9	to	12	million	new	jobs	were	created	by	the robotics	industry	between	2000	and	2016{193},	arguing	that	those countries	with	higher	numbers	of	robots	are	also	the	countries	with	lower unemployment	rates.	The	theory	behind	this	is	that	although	robots	may replace	labor-intensive	jobs,	they	also	create	new	ones	in	the	technology field	for	robot	designers,	manufacturers,	programmers,	and	the	like.  While	Asian	countries	tend	to	have	higher	numbers	of	working	robots, western	countries	like	the	United	States	are	not	so	far	behind.	It	is	also clear	that	the	robotics	industry	will	continue	to	grow	in	the	coming	years, as	will	the	creative	jobs	market	along	with	it.   	   65.	What	Are	Some	of	the	Home	Robots?  In	the	future,	your	home	will	probably	be	full	of	different	types	of	robots performing	various	tasks	that	you	prefer	not	to	do.	There	will	likely	be robots	anywhere	from	your	kitchen	to	your	living	room	to	your	garden doing	things	that	will	help	you	to	automate	and	save	time.	By	saving	us time,	robots	will	help	enable	humans	to	focus	on	the	things	we	enjoy doing,	rather	than	filling	up	our	days	with	the	mundane	tasks	and	chores we	must	do.  Following	are	some	of	the	most	common	types	of	robots	that	are currently	being	developed,	and	some	that	have	already	reached	the market.	Keep	in	mind,	however,	that	in	the	future	there	will	be	many	more advanced	versions	of	these	robots.  Kitchen	Robots  One	of	the	most	interesting	types	of	kitchen	robots	currently	under development	is	a	cooking	one	by	Moley,	which	can	reportedly	prepare over	100	meals	by	top	chefs	including	Thomas	Keller,	Alain	Ducasse	and Gordon	Ramsay.  This	robotic	kitchen	comes	with	cabinetry,	appliances	and	two	robotic motion	capture	systems,	as	well	as	other	features	that	allow	this automated	chef	to	cook	sophisticated	meals.	The	company	has	also been	working	on	a	feature	that	would	add	a	dishwashing	and	kitchen cleaning	element	to	this	product.  Moley’s	robotic	kitchen	will	reportedly	be	available	by	2018	and	cost about	$15,000.	It	is	quite	likely	that	future	homes	will	be	sold	with	robotic kitchens	already	installed.{194}  Cleaning	Robots  The	most	familiar	cleaning	robot	is	the	Roomba	by	iRobot.	The	company is	considered	an	industry	leader	because	it	was	the	first	one	in	this market,	with	the	Roomba	robotic	vacuum	cleaner.	iRobot	was	founded	in 1990	and	first	released	the	Roomba	in	2002,	according	to	its	website{195}. The	company	now	sells	several	home	cleaning	robotic	models,	including   the	Braava	jet	mopping	robot,	all	of	which	it	is	constantly	working	on improving.	iRobot	has	been	developing	a	variety	of	other	home	robotic products	as	well.  Today	there	are	other	companies	moving	into	this	space	as	well,	such	as bObsweep,	ILIFE	and	ECOVACS	Robotics,	all	of	which	have	developed floor	cleaning	robots.  	  Figure	7.4.	iRobot	Scooba	450.   Image	Credit	http:  media.irobot.com   	  Ironing	Robots  Ironing	robots	promise	to	be	huge	time	savers,	as	ironing	can	be	a	big headache	for	busy	people.   The	first	ironing	robot	was	the	Dressman	from	Siemans,	which	will	prove to	be	a	valuable	utility	for	those	looking	to	save	time{196}.  This	machine,	which	is	in	the	shape	of	an	upper	torso,	works	by	using	hot air	on	a	damp	shirt.	The	shirt	is	placed	on	the	robot	and	the	hot	air inflates	and	dries	it	while	removing	creases	at	the	same	time. Gardening	Robots  An	innovative	robot,	called	the	Tertill,	can	assist	with	maintaining	a garden	by	weeding	it	for	you{197}.	It	can	move	around	your	garden, measure	the	size	of	every	plant,	and	cut	all	of	those	that	are	less	than	an inch	long.	It	also	has	a	way	to	protect	your	smaller,	growing	plants	from being	cut.  Also,	because	the	Tertill	is	solar	powered,	it	can	stay	right	in	the	garden itself,	allowing	it	to	work	the	ground	daily.	The	Tertill	was	designed	by one	of	the	team	members	that	also	worked	on	the	Roomba.  Lawnmowing	Robots  There	are	several	companies	that	have	already	produced	robotic lawnmowers,	including	Gardena	and	Husqvarna,	among	others.  However,	the	current	versions	of	these	robots	have	only	received average	consumer	ratings	at	online	stores	such	as	Amazon.com.	As	with other	types	of	robots,	the	lawnmower	robot	will	only	improve	with	time.  Basic	Home	Robots  This	type	of	robot	is	more	of	a	companion	style	and	many	have	been designed	to	recognize	human	expressions	and	emotions.	Because	there are	so	many	companies	currently	working	in	this	space,	there	will	be	a wide	variety	of	home	robots	on	the	market	in	the	future.  An	example	of	one	such	companion	robot	is	Kuri,	which	was	developed by	Mayfield	Robotics,	a	company	based	in	California.	Like	Kuri,	many	of the	home	companion	robots	are	still	in	the	early	days	of	design	and	thus are	rudimentary	compared	to	what	we	can	expect	in	the	future.	The	home companion	robots	of	the	future	will	likely	be	equipped	to	learn	about	the   home	and	family	members,	record	videos,	and	help	out	in	a	variety	of ways.{198}  Smart	Home	Robots  In	the	future,	everything	in	our	homes	will	be	connected	through	the Internet	of	Things	 IoT .	It	will	be	commonplace	to	have	robots	and everything	will	be	connected.	This	will	include	all	the	home	items	like	the refrigerator	and	other	appliances,	and	may	even	extend	to	other	home items	like	furniture.	Home	robots	will	also	be	commonplace	in	the	future, and	these	will	be	connected	to	the	IoT	as	well.  The	creator	of	the	Roomba	believes	that	in	the	future	all	robots	will	be invisible.  “Consumers	want	a	spotless	floor;	not	a	machine	buzzing	around underfoot,”	Joe	Jones	wrote	in	a	blog	post{199}.	“People	want	the	things	a robot	can	do	for	them;	the	robot	itself	may	just	get	in	the	way.”  The	positive	side	of	home	robotics	and	smart	homes	will	be	that	the robots	can	automate	mundane	tasks	and	help	us	save	time.	They	will allow	people	to	stop	doing	many	of	the	chores	they	dislike,	leaving	them more	time	to	do	what	they	enjoy.  However,	a	possible	negative	effect	could	be	that	people	may	start	to lose	the	ability	to	engage	and	interact	with	other	human	beings	due	to spending	too	much	time	with	robots	in	their	homes.	We	must	keep	in mind	that	the	basic	idea	of	having	robots	is	to	help	us	with	tasks,	not	to change	who	we	are	as	human	beings.  Another	concern	regarding	home	robots	is	the	possible	loss	of	privacy. Most	home	robots	will	be	connected	to	the	cloud	and	might	also	be capable	of	recording	private	conversations	and	other	personal information	within	the	home.	Knowing	that	their	privacy	could	potentially be	violated	will	make	many	people	feel	nervous	about	allowing	these robots	into	their	homes.	This	apprehension	will	likely	cause	consumers	to adapt	to	home	robots	at	a	slower	pace,	which	in	turn	will	slow	down	the growth	of	home	robots	in	general.   	   66.	Which	Are	the	Most	Sophisticated	Robots?  Boston	Dynamics	has	emerged	as	the	leading	robotics	company	with	the most	advanced	robots	we	have	seen	to	date.  The	company	got	its	start	at	the	Massachusetts	Institute	of	Technology  MIT 	as	a	project	with	the	objective	of	building	robots	that	maneuvered like	animals.	The	majority	of	Boston	Dynamics’	initial	robot	developments were	funded	by	military	contracts.	That	changed,	however,	when	the company	was	bought	by	Google	 Alphabet	Inc. 	in	2013{200}		and subsequently	bought	from	Alphabet	by	SoftBank	in	June	of	2017.  The	reason	why	Boston	Dynamics	is	so	significant	is	because	it	was	the first	company	to	create	and	showcase	robots	that	are	extremely sophisticated	in	design	and	agility.	These	robots	have	demonstrated	the ability	to	perform	complicated	tasks	that	until	now	have	only	been	seen	in the	movies.  Thanks	to	social	media	sites	such	as	YouTube	and	Facebook showcasing	videos	of	their	robotic	creations,	Boston	Dynamics	has	been getting	a	great	deal	of	attention.	This	attention	has	brought	a	whole	new awareness	to	the	public	of	what	robots	can	really	do	and	the	wide	range of	possibilities	robots	provide	for	enriching	our	lives.  	   Figure	7.5.	Image	of	Video	Showing	Boston	Dynamics’	Atlas	Robot  Jumping	on	an	Object.   Image	Credit:	https:  youtu.be fRj34o4hN4I   	  Following	are	just	three	examples	of	the	innovative	robots	Boston Dynamics	has	designed.   	Handle:	The	Handle	model	of	robot	is	a	biped	that	combines  wheels	and	limbs,	giving	it	lots	of	strength	and	mobility.	The	wheels allow	the	robot	to	move	quickly	on	flat	surfaces	while	the	legs	give it	the	ability	to	handle	nearly	any	terrain.	Handle	can	also	make	4- foot	jumps,	adding	to	the	already	impressive	6.5-foot	height	of	the machine.{201}		The	robot	has	10	actuated	joints,	enabling	it	to	lift heavy	items	and	maneuver	in	all	kinds	of	spaces.	It	can	travel	15 miles	on	a	full	charge	at	a	speed	of	9	miles	per	hour,	and	comes equipped	with	both	electric	and	hydraulic	actuators.	Handle	was first	featured	in	a	video	at	the	2015	DARPA	Robotics	Challenge. Wired	magazine	has	called	the	robot	an	“evolutionary	marvel.”{202}   	Spot:	In	keeping	with	its	history	of	robotic	animal	creations,	Boston  Dynamics	introduced	Spot,	a	robotic	dog	intended	to	deliver packages,	at	the	TED	2017	conference.	This	robot	was	designed   by	the	company	in	an	effort	to	find	ways	to	commercialize	its creations.	Boston	Dynamics	has	been	getting	Spot	to	practice delivering	packages	to	employees’	homes	to	help	refine	its	abilities and	design.	{203}		Spot	has	12	joints,	is	electrically	powered,	and	has hydraulic	actuation.	It	has	been	designed	to	tackle	both	indoor	and outdoor	tasks,	and	can	run	for	45	minutes	on	a	single	charge.	Also, according	to	the	company’s	website,	by	using	its	LIDAR	and	stereo vision,	Spot	can	sense	rough	terrain.{204}   	Spot	Mini:	A	smaller	version	of	Boston	Dynamics’	robot	dog	has been	designed	as	a	helpful	worker	in	office,	home,	and	outdoor environments.	Spot	Mini	can	carry	up	to	30	pounds,	has	17	joints, and	has	the	ability	to	climb	stairs.	Altogether	Spot	Mini	weighs	25 pounds	and	can	run	for	90	minutes	when	fully	charged.	The	Mini	is more	mobile	than	the	larger	version,	and	it	comes	with	an	arm	that can	be	used	to	pick	up	and	deliver	objects.	It	also	comes	equipped with	stereo	cameras,	depth	cameras,	and	position force	sensors	in the	limbs	that	assist	with	navigation	and	mobility.	In	addition,	the company	claims	that	this	is	the	quietest	robot	they	have	built.{205}  Boston	Dynamics	CEO	Marc	Raibert	has	been	quoted	as	saying	that	the company’s	long-range	plans	are	to	build	robots	for	everyday	use.	“Our goal	is	really	to	build	robots	that	are	equal	to	or	greater	than	people	in terms	of	their	mobility,	manipulation	dexterity,	perception	and intelligence,”	Raibert	said.{206}		Raibert	also	believes	that	robotics	will	be bigger	than	the	Internet.{207}  These	robots	are	just	a	few	examples	of	those	that	are	being	designed today,	and	there	will	be	many,	many	more	in	the	future.	Because	robots will	soon	be	prevalent	in	the	commercial	space,	now	is	the	time	to become	more	familiar	with	different	types	of	robots	and	their	capabilities for	everyday	life.  Another	company	that	has	been	in	the	media	spotlight	is	Hanson Robotics,	which	has	created	an	amazingly	human-looking	robot	called Sophia.	According	to	the	company’s	website,	Sophia	can	do	things	like teach	kids,	help	elderly	people,	and,	most	remarkably,	even	mimic human	facial	expressions.{208}   In	October	of	2017,	Saudi	Arabia	awarded	an	honorary	citizenship	to Sophia	the	robot,	a	move	which	was	considered	by	many	to	be	nothing more	than	a	publicity	stunt.	This	was	widely	believed	because	of	the country’s	well-known	ambition	of	transforming	its	oil-dependent	economy into	a	more	digitally-based	one.	Also,	many	experts	agree	that	granting citizenship	rights	to	an	inanimate	object	like	a	robot	could	be	problematic for	several	reasons.{209}  	  	  Figure	7.6.	Sophia	the	Robot	by	Hanson	Robotics.

While	there	are	plenty	of	examples	of	artificial	intelligence	being	used	to assist	businesses	in	the	service	and	hospitality	industries,	the	Henn	na Hotel	in	Japan	is	in	a	class	by	itself.	This	remarkable	hotel,	founded	by Hideo	Sawada,	is	the	first	in	the	world	to	be	run	by	a	“staff”	that	is composed	almost	completely	of	robots.  The	primary	objective	of	this	innovative	experiment	was	to	determine whether	operating	the	hotel	almost	exclusively	through	the	use	of	robots would	maximize	its	overall	efficiency	and	service.	The	initial	results	have been	positive	and	Henn	na	is	already	beginning	to	expand,	replicating this	hotel	in	other	locations,	with	the	goal	of	eventually	opening	similar hotels	across	Japan	and	around	the	globe.  Here	are	a	few	examples	of	how	the	Henn	na	Hotel	uses	robot	workers:  	Receptionists:	These	robotic	receptionists	look	almost	human	and  can	speak	English,	Japanese	and	Korean.   	Bellhops:	These	robotic	assistants	can	deliver	your	luggage  directly	to	your	room.	Additionally,	the	hotel	is	keyless,	with	rooms being	opened	based	on	facial	recognition	technology.   	Concierge:	This	voice-activated	concierge	bot	operates	within	the hotel	room	to	turn	appliances	on	and	off,	and	provide	information about	the	weather	and	more,	all	with	a	few	simple	verbal commands.  There	are	a	variety	of	other	robots	utilized	at	Henn	na,	including	one	that is	available	to	guard	your	luggage.	To	get	a	better	picture	of	how	the Henn	na	Hotel	operates,	check	out	this	documentary	on	YouTube: https:  youtube mpzIQt6l4xY  In	total,	Henn	na	has	about	140	robots,	in	addition	to	7	human	staff members	for	oversight	and	quality	control.	With	a	team	of	primarily robotic	workers,	the	management	for	this	hotel	doesn’t	have	to	worry about	overtime	pay,	vacations,	bonuses,	or	other	traditional	staffing   about	overtime	pay,	vacations,	bonuses,	or	other	traditional	staffing issues.  The	Henn	na	Hotel	is	a	key	example	of	how	the	service	industry	will	be helped	by	robotic	technology,	although	this	hotel	may	certainly	be	too extreme	for	some;	many	tourists	prefer	having	a	sense	of	human connection	during	a	hotel	stay.	In	all	likeliness,	the	ideal	combination	for businesses	in	the	hospitality	industry	will	come	from	offering	a	blend	of traditional	human	connection	with	robotic	assistants.  In	the	future,	we	will	probably	see	more	and	more	businesses	in	the service	and	hospitality	industries	introducing	robotic	aides	working together	with	traditional	human	staff	members.	As	this	happens,	their focus	should	continue	to	be	on	providing	quality	experiences	and	offering excellent	customer	service.  	   68.	What	Are	Some	of	the	Ethical	Questions	of	Life with	Robots?  There	is	no	doubt	that	the	fields	of	robotics	and	artificial	intelligence	will generate	a	lot	of	good	things	in	the	world.	This	can	include	faster research	into	serious	illnesses	and	their	cures,	diminishing	the	number	of fatalities	in	traffic	accidents,	and	helping	to	stimulate	economic	growth, among	other	things.  In	spite	of	this,	there	are	still	a	number	of	fundamental	ethical	issues	that arise	with	the	use	of	robotic	technologies.	One	basic	premise	that	has been	proposed	by	experts	in	the	field	for	years	is	that	the	creation	of robotic	aides	should	always	be	done	with	an	eye	toward	helping	us	to	live better	lives,	promoting	the	welfare	of	mankind.	There	is	no	guarantee, however,	that	every	individual	or	company	that	implements	these technologies	will	adhere	to	this	guideline.	Furthermore,	many	are	likely	to encounter	complex	ethical	issues	in	their	search	for	economic	gain	using AI	tools.  As	you	consider	the	ways	in	which	robotic	and	AI	technologies	can	be implemented,	here	are	some	of	the	ethical	questions	you	should	keep	in mind:   	How	Can	We	Ensure	That	Robotics	Will	Not	Promote	Inequality  in	the	World?	Because	it’s	very	likely	that	a	small	number	of wealthy	people	will	be	the	first	to	invest	in	robotics,	it	will	be important	to	create	initiatives	to	spread	information	and	educational opportunities	to	all	socioeconomic	groups	in	regard	to	the	benefits of	AI-powered	resources.	How	can	this	be	accomplished?   	How	Can	We	Preserve	Social	Skills	as	Interactions	with  Robotics	Increase?	Every	time	a	new	kind	of	technology	becomes widely	adopted,	it	changes	the	way	people	interact,	not	only	with that	tool,	but	also	with	each	other.	What	are	some	of	the	ways	we can	encourage	positive	human	relationships	in	the	midst	of	AI technologies	so	that	we	don’t	lose	essential	communication	skills?    	Should	We	Trust	Robots	Fully?	Robotic	tools	are	already	being  used	in	surgical	centers	and	hospitals,	the	military,	and	other potentially	life-or-death	situations,	a	trend	that	is	likely	to	grow.	As the	use	of	robotics	continues	to	increase	in	other	industries,	and	for serious	purposes,	how	should	we	respond	if	AI	tools	fail	to	do	what they	are	supposed	to	do,	or	even	cause	harm?	What	happens when	people	begin	to	doubt	their	own	judgment,	relying	instead	on robots	to	provide	answers	to	important	questions?	One	idea	is	to create	an	“ethical	black	box”	to	be	embedded	in	all	robots,	which would	allow	them	to	explain	their	decision-making	processes,	an idea	that	I	firmly	agree	with.	You	can	read	more	about	this suggestion	here:	https:  goo.gl SnCv2z   	What	Rights	Should	Robots	Have?	While	humans	have	basic intrinsic	rights	agreed	upon	and	protected	by	most	governments, what	rights,	if	any,	should	intelligent	robots	have?   	How	Do	We	Effectively	Legislate	the	Use	of	Robots?	As	robotic  technologies	become	less	expensive	and	time-consuming	to create,	what	kinds	of	legislative	decisions	will	we	need	to	make,	as a	society,	to	help	us	avoid	making	mistakes	with	dire consequences	in	the	development	and	application	of	these	tools?  This	is	just	a	sampling	of	some	of	the	ethical	issues	that	need	to	be addressed	now,	in	the	early	developmental	stages	of	robotic technologies,	in	both	the	public	and	political	realms.	Because	it’s	possible that	much	of	the	source	code	data	for	robots	will	be	“open	source”  meaning	available	to	everyone ,	there	is	great	potential	for	these	tools	to have	a	huge	impact	on	our	lives,	for	better	or	for	worse.  Already,	some	of	the	companies	that	participate	in	the	development	and use	of	AI	tools	and	robotics	have	come	together	to	create	the	Partnership on	AI	 more	information	about	that	can	be	found	at www.partnershiponai.org ,	which	seeks	to	advance	public	understanding of	AI	and	robotic	technologies	and	to	encourage	discussion	on	related topics.	Another	similar	initiative,	which	is	spearheaded	by	Reid	Hoffman, founder	of	the	Omidyar	Network,	the	Knight	Foundation	and	LinkedIn,	is called	the	Ethics	and	Governance	of	Artificial	Intelligence	Fund.  Currently,	however,	these	initiatives	are	not	widely	known,	so	many   Currently,	however,	these	initiatives	are	not	widely	known,	so	many people	aren’t	aware	of	the	speed	at	which	robotics	are	developing	and how	important	it	is	for	individuals,	businesses,	and	even	governments	to start	thinking	and	talking	about	the	impacts	of	robotic	technologies	right now.  	   69.	How	Can	We	Successfully	Adapt	to	Life	with Robots?  History	has	shown	that	as	new	technologies	come	along,	most	people are	slow	to	adapt,	taking	time	to	become	familiar	and	comfortable	with the	new	tools	and	their	impacts	and	applications.	The	problem	that	arises with	AI	and	robotics	is	that	these	resources	are	growing	exponentially, making	it	all	the	more	important	to	discuss	their	uses	and	implications now.  One	important	question	is:	how	can	we	prepare	to	adapt	for	a	future	in which	we	live	and	work	with	robots	on	a	daily	basis?	While	there	is	no absolute,	perfect	answer	to	this	question,	one	very	important	thing	to keep	in	mind	is	that	the	purpose	of	robotic	aides	is	to	improve	our	lives	in a	measurable	way.  	   Figure	7.7.	Human-Robot	Collaboration.  	  As	more	AI-powered	tools	begin	to	take	on	the	tasks	that	were	once performed	by	us,	it’s	possible	that	the	original	purpose	of	robotics	will eventually	be	forgotten.	We	need	to	remember	that	robotic	tools	are	here to	serve	us,	not	the	other	way	around.  While	I	don’t	have	every	answer	when	it	comes	to	the	best	ways	to	adapt to	life	with	robots,	here	are	some	of	the	questions	you	can	consider	that may	help	guide	your	thought	process	and	inspire	you	to	take	action:   may	help	guide	your	thought	process	and	inspire	you	to	take	action:   	What	can	you	do	personally	to	help	society	as	a	whole	to	adjust	to  living	and	working	alongside	robots?   	What	do	politicians	and	world	leaders	need	to	know	about	robotics  and	AI	to	help	them	to	be	successful?   	How	can	we	educate	our	children	about	the	uses	and	implications  of	robotics?   	How	can	we	foster	an	increase	in	the	number	of	educators	who	can  communicate	the	importance	of	robotic	tools	and	teach	ways	to work	together	with	robotic	aides?   	What	are	some	ways	that	educational	institutions	can	develop  programs	to	share	positive	information	about	robots?   	What	are	some	of	the	important	ethical	guidelines	that	should	be	in place	regarding	the	use	of	robots	and	how	can	we	implement	them effectively?   	How	can	we	ensure	that	robotic	tools	are	available	to	all  socioeconomic	groups?   	How	can	we	avoid	potential	drawbacks	or	harm	that	may	be	caused  by	robots?   	How	do	we	make	sure	that	everyone	in	society	has	the	same  opportunities	to	learn	about	and	benefit	from	robots	and	robotics, rather	than	just	the	wealthy?   	How	do	we	make	sure	that	interpersonal	communication	skills	don’t suffer,	in	a	world	where	many	people	might	choose	to	communicate and	spend	most	of	their	time	with	robots	instead	of	humans?  My	own	reflection	on	this	is	that	we	urgently	need	more	public	education and	conversation	about	the	roles	of	robots	in	society.	We	must	address issues	like	how	their	roles	will	evolve	as	they	become	more	popular	and lifelike,	what	their	relationships	will	be	to	humans,	and	how	the	roles	of humans	may	change	as	a	result.	We	need	to	engage	in	these	types	of discussions	and	education	before	there	is	a	major	proliferation	of	human-   discussions	and	education	before	there	is	a	major	proliferation	of	human- like	robots.	If	we	are	not	properly	prepared	in	advance,	then	a	sudden influx	of	these	robots	could	lead	to	social	unrest,	including	a	lot	of confused,	angry,	and	otherwise	unhappy	people.  The	most	important	thing	is	to	start	taking	action	now,	rather	than	waiting until	advanced	robotic	technologies	have	already	flooded	the	market	and our	lives.	International	laws	and	restrictions	will	play	a	key	role	in	how robots	are	created	and	used	within	the	next	few	years,	so	the	education of	politicians	and	leaders	around	the	globe	should	be	a	core	focus surrounding	the	continued	development	of	robotic	technologies.  	   70.	What	Are	Some	Recommended	Resources	on Robots	and	Robotics?  If	you’re	interested	in	learning	about	the	inner	workings	of	robotic technologies,	there	are	plenty	of	books	related	to	the	technical	side	of robotics	available	on	Amazon.com.	If,	however,	the	applications	and implications	of	these	technologies	are	of	interest	to	you,	check	out	some of	the	resources	that	I	recommend	below.  Perhaps	one	of	the	most	well-known	books	on	robotics	and	their	potential impacts	is	called	Rise	of	the	Robots:	Technology	and	the	Threat	of	a Jobless	Future	by	Martin	Ford.	This	book	was	one	of	the	first	to	address the	topic	of	changes	in	the	workforce	due	to	robotics.	It	illustrates	the dramatic	implications	possible	in	the	future	as	robots	are	developed	and used	in	more	ways.	It	particularly	highlights	the	potential	for	human	job loss.  For	something	with	a	little	more	focus	on	the	human	side,	I’d	recommend Gerd	Leonhard’s	book,	Technology	vs.	Humanity:	The	Coming	Clash Between	Man	and	Machine,	which	discusses	exponential	growth technologies	and	their	possible	impact	on	humans.	I	especially	enjoy Leonhard’s	focus	on	the	importance	of	humanity	preserving	its	essence and	power	over	technology,	as	well	as	the	ethical	issues	that	may	arise from	these	robotic	tools.  If,	instead,	you	are	interested	in	learning	how	to	build	robots,	I	would suggest	a	more	interactive	resource,	the	free	online	course	from	Udacity entitled	Artificial	Intelligence	for	Robotics,	which	can	be	found	here: https:  www.udacity.com course artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373. This	web-based	video	course	is	taught	by	Sebastian	Thrun,	a	German computer	scientist	who	led	Google’s	self-driving	car	team	and	is	known as	one	of	the	top	experts	in	the	field	of	robotics	and	artificial	intelligence in	the	world	today.  Lastly,	as	a	reliable	and	up-to-date	source	of	quality	information	on	the continued	development	of	robotic	technologies,	you	can	take	a	look	at the	World	Economic	Forum’s	articles	on	AI	and	robots,	which	can	be found	at:   found	at:  https:  www.weforum.org agenda archive artificial-intelligence-and- robotics    CHAPTER	VIII  ARTIFICIAL	INTELLIGENCE	ACTIVITIES	OF  BIG	TECHNOLOGY	COMPANIES  	  Figure	8.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	VIII.  	   Nearly	every	large	technology	company	out	there	has	placed	a	high priority	on	the	development	and	application	of	artificial	intelligence.	In	this chapter,	we’ll	talk	about	ten	of	these	companies,	taking	an	in-depth	look at	the	ways	in	which	they’ve	already	applied	AI,	as	well	as	how	they	are developing	and	researching	it.  Because	the	field	is	ever-changing,	it	can	be	complicated	to	keep	up	with all	of	the	developments	in	AI.	For	this	reason,	I	recommend	following these	companies	closely	as	they	continue	to	release	interesting	AI-based products	and	services.  Although	all	of	the	ten	companies	highlighted	in	this	chapter	are	sizeable and	international,	there	are	also	numerous	startups	around	the	world	that are	working	on	fascinating	applications	for	AI.	Investments	into	AI startups	have	grown	significantly	over	the	past	few	years,	which	has opened	up	the	sector	to	smaller	players	who	are	taking	on	challenges	in new	and	exciting	ways.  You	may	also	notice	that	the	first	seven	companies	we’ll	address	are	all based	out	of	the	United	States.	However,	innovation	and	development	in AI	is	happening	across	the	globe,	so	be	on	the	lookout	for	world- changing	AI	products	and	services	from	outside	the	U.S.	as	well.  In	particular,	the	last	three	companies	on	our	list	are	based	out	of	China, which	is	quickly	becoming	a	leader	in	artificial	intelligence	tools.	To	stay up-to-date,	I	recommend	that	you	closely	follow	the	AI-based developments	coming	out	of	China.  	   71.	What	Are	Google’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Google	is	one	of	the	largest	data-based	companies	in	the	world,	in possession	of	data	from	millions	of	users	obtained	through	Google.com searches,	YouTube,	Gmail,	and	other	Google-owned	products	and services.	Having	access	to	such	an	enormous	quantity	of	data	has provided	Google	with	the	perfect	head	start	to	becoming	one	of	the	world leaders	in	artificial	intelligence.  Artificial	intelligence	is	one	of	the	key	priorities	for	Google	and	its	parent company,	Alphabet	Inc.	Google	is	considered	one	of	the	most	advanced AI	companies,	as	almost	all	of	its	new	products	and	services	apply artificial	intelligence	technology	in	some	way.  How	Google	Applies	Artificial	Intelligence	in	its	Products  The	following	are	some	practical	examples	of	how	Google	applies	AI:   	Basic	Google	Search:	Each	time	you	search	something	on  google.com,	you	get	results	based	on	Google’s	machine	learning algorithm,	which	learns	from	your	every	search	and	personalizes the	results	for	you.	Google	wants	to	develop	its	search	capabilities so	that	it	would	even	be	able	to	predict	what	you	want	to	search,	all thanks	to	machine	learning	and	artificial	intelligence.{210}   	Google	Assistant:	Google’s	personal	assistant	can	help	you	by  informing	you	about	the	current	weather	conditions,	translating	your text	into	over	100	languages,	and	updating	you	on	the	status	of your	flight.	It	can	be	used	to	create	reminders,	make	dinner reservations,	and	even	dim	the	lights	in	your	home	when	used	with the	Google	Home	service.  As	it	becomes	more	common	to	use	smart	assistants	like	these,	some critics	are	voicing	concerns	over	the	privacy	of	the	data	being	exposed, such	as	the	conversations	you	have	with	your	Google	Assistant.	For	this reason,	Google	has	added	a	support	section	to	Google	Assistant,	with easy	tools	that	allow	users	to	modify	their	settings	and	permissions,	and   even	delete	past	Assistant	data	if	desired.	This	support	section	can	be found	here:	www.goo.gl GPjkCf.	You	can	also	learn	more	about	Google Assistant	in	general	here:	https:  assistant.google.com  	  Figure	8.2.	Google	Assistant	Website.  https:  assistant.google.com  	   	Google	Photos:	This	has	been	used	in	image	recognition	to	assist  with	the	sorting	and	indexing	of	photos	uploaded	to	the	Internet. Google	has	expanded	its	use	to	include	image	enhancement, which	can	add	details	that	are	missing	from	an	image.   	Speech	Recognition:	Google	Assistant	uses	deep	learning	to  recognize	commands,	questions,	and	other	spoken	instructions. This	has	also	extended	into	Google’s	translation	service.{211}    	YouTube:	Google	uses	machine	learning	to	better	track	users’ viewing	habits,	which	helps	to	improve	the	accuracy	of	its	video recommendations.   	Google	Pixel	Buds:	Pixel	Buds	are	a	brand	of	Bluetooth	ear	buds  from	Google.	They	are	marketed	as	being	able	to	provide instantaneous	translation	services	for	over	40	supported languages.	Currently,	Google’s	AI-powered	language	translation service	is	one	of	the	best	available.	Using	the	Pixel	Buds,	a	person could	press	down	on	the	right	ear	bud	and	say,	“Help	me	speak Italian.”	The	left	ear	bud	would	then	translate	everything.	While	the first	release	of	this	product	will	probably	not	be	perfect,	over	time	it could	become	a	tremendous	asset	for	people	both	professionally and	personally.{212}   	Google’s	Self-Driving	Cars:	Google’s	self-driving	cars	are powered	by	artificial	intelligence	and	machine	learning,	and according	to	reports	the	company	has	already	spent	more	than $1.1	billion	on	their	development.{213}  In	addition,	there	are	many	other	areas	in	which	Google	applies	AI, including	healthcare	projects	and	its	cloud	services.  AI	Companies	Google	Has	Acquired  In	2014	Google	bought	DeepMind	which,	according	to	some	experts, might	be	one	of	the	most	advanced	AI	companies	in	the	world.  Additionally,	Google	has	acquired	12	other	artificial	intelligence companies	such	as	Halli	Labs,	Kaggle,	and	Api.ai,	a	free	application	that you	can	use	to	build	your	own	AI	assistant.  Best	Achievements	of	Google’s	AI  Some	of	the	best	examples	that	demonstrate	the	capabilities	and possibilities	of	Google’s	AI	programs	include:   	AlphaGo:	This	AI	software	developed	by	DeepMind	demonstrates the	power	of	deep	learning	by	being	the	first	computer	program	to ever	defeat	a	human	player	at	the	extraordinarily	complex	Chinese   strategy	game	of	Go.	According	to	DeepMind	CEO	Demis Hassabis,	AlphaGo	uses	deep	neural	networks	to	play	the	ancient Chinese	game	of	Go	against	itself	thousands	of	times,	learning from	its	mistakes	along	the	way.{214}  In	October	of	2017,	DeepMind	announced	that	AlphaGo	Zero	had learned	how	to	play	Go	completely	without	human	input.	This	new machine	learning	system	was	able	to	defeat	the	previous	version	of AlphaGo	in	just	three	days,	ending	with	a	score	of	100	games	won to	0.	All	previous	versions	of	AlphaGo	had	required	data	entered	by humans	in	order	to	learn	how	to	play	the	game.	In	contrast, AlphaGo	Zero	teaches	itself	solely	through	self-play	that	begins with	random	moves.{215}   	Bot	Learns	to	Walk:	A	Google	AI	bot,	also	developed	by  DeepMind,	taught	itself	how	to	walk,	run	and	jump	without	human instruction.	Through	the	use	of	reinforcement	learning,	meaning reward	signals	sent	to	the	machine	when	it	performs	certain behaviors,	the	bot	was	able	to	find	its	own	way	over	obstacles.{216}   	TensorFlow:	This	an	open	source	library	that	assists	in	machine  learning	for	developers	and	researchers.	Google	first	released Tensorflow	in	November	of	2015.	The	Internet	giant	later	released TensorFlow	Lite,	TensorFlow’s	lightweight	solution	for	mobile	and embedded	devices	in	November	of	2017.{217}  Google’s	AI	Services	and	Experiments   	Google’s	AI	Services	for	Companies:	Google	has	also	opened	its  AI	cloud	services	to	other	companies	for	use	in	applying	powerful machine	learning	services.	This	service	offers	great	advantages	to companies	who	understand	how	to	leverage	this	platform. https:  cloud.google.com products machine-learning   	Google’s	Cloud-Based	AI	Tools:	Google	has	a	website	that  focuses	exclusively	on	AI,	displaying	different	AI	tools	the	company recommends	that	everyone	should	use,	as	well	as	news	related	to its	AI	projects.	One	interesting	such	project	is	Kaggle.com	which, according	to	the	website,	is	the	world’s	biggest	community	for	data   science	and	machine	learning,	and	includes	competitions	and experiments.{218}	https:  ai.google   	Google’s	AI	Experiments:	Google	has	implemented	a	program called	AI	Experiments,	where	anyone	can	submit	their	AI-related projects	and	the	most	creative	and	notable	ones	are	presented	on the	website	https:  experiments.withgoogle.com ai.	One	example	of such	a	project	is	called	AutoDraw,	a	tool	that	guesses	what	you	are trying	to	draw	and	offers	more	realistic	looking	versions	as	options. You	can	try	it	yourself	at:	www.autodraw.com   	Do-it-Yourself	AI:	Google	has	a	website	dedicated	to	providing everyone	with	tools	and	development	kits	to	help	them	build	their own	AI-related	products.	The	first	project	Google	has	shared	on this	website	is	called	AIY	Projects	Voice	Kit,	which	is	a	natural language	recognizer	that	can	be	connected	to	Google	Assistant, and	basically	allows	you	to	build	your	own	application	for	Google Assistant.	https:  aiyprojects.withgoogle.com voice  	  Figure	8.3.

Recently	Google	CEO	Sundar	Pichai	said	that	the	company’s	machine learning	software	could	even	be	used	to	produce	more	machine	learning software,	to	help	remedy	the	talent	shortage	in	the	industry.	The company	seems	to	be	determined	to	take	AI	to	the	next	level,	using	it	to enhance	its	applications	and,	in	turn,	users’	experiences.{219}  You	can	learn	more	about	Google’s	machine	learning	publications	at:  https:  research.google.com pubs MachineIntelligence.html  	   72.	What	Are	Facebook’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Facebook	has	been	able	to	accumulate	such	an	enormous	user	base thanks	to	machine	learning	and	AI,	combined	with	the	massive	amounts of	detailed	personal	information	users	share	on	their	profiles.	Facebook’s AI-powered	algorithm	is	able	to	analyze	and	learn	from	people’s	shared personal	data	to	understand	their	individual	preferences	and	interests. This	allows	Facebook	to	provide	each	user	with	their	own	unique	and personalized	Facebook	experience,	contributing	significantly	to	the	social network’s	popularity.  Artificial	Intelligence	has	become	a	big	priority	for	Facebook.	The company	has	been	using	AI	to	create	new	products	and	will	doubtlessly feature	it	in	future	projects	as	well.	Some	of	these	projects	will	include technologies	like	virtual	reality	and	augmented	reality,	which	are	powered by	AI.  Practical	Examples	of	Artificial	Intelligence	at	Facebook   	Facebook	Photo	Search:	This	feature	enlists	the	help	of	AI,	which enables	Facebook	to	understand	the	content	of	photos.	The	benefit for	users	is	that	image	searches	can	be	done	using	keywords	on the	social	media	platform.{220}   	FBLearner	Flow:	As	mentioned	above,	basically	everything  Facebook	does	is	made	possible	thanks	to	the	effective	use	of artificial	intelligence.	FBLearner	Flow,	which	Facebook	refers	to	as its	“AI	backbone,”	analyzes	all	the	user	content	posted	and	then personalizes	everyone’s	experience	in	a	unique	way.{221}	If	you	want to	learn	more	about	how	it	works,	visit: https:  code.facebook.com posts 1072626246134461 introducing- fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone   	   Figure	8.4.

Currently,	DeepText	can	understand	the	textual	content	of posts	in	over	20	languages.{222}  The	social	media	giant	has	started	to	use	text	analysis	as	a weapon	in	the	fight	against	terrorism.	In	a	post	on	Facebook, Facebook	CEO	Mark	Zuckerberg	wrote	that	the	company	had	been relying	on	reports	from	users	to	learn	about	any	terrorism-related posts,	but	since	that	is	not	the	most	effective	way	to	monitor extremist	activity,	the	company	has	started	using	AI	to	quickly	and efficiently	filter	out	any	content	that	may	be	connected	to	any terrorist	activities	or	threats.	That	includes	teaching	the	system	to recognize	text	and	photos	related	to	unwanted	activity.{223}   	Pattern	Recognition	to	Prevent	Suicides:	Facebook	now	has	a  deep	learning	algorithm	that	can	analyze	users’	posts	and comments	to	spot	possible	suicide	plans	and	then	alert	the   appropriate	professionals.	The	company	started	testing	this	in	the U.S.	in	March	of	2017,	and	plans	to	extend	it	to	other	countries once	testing	in	the	U.S.	has	been	successfully	completed.{224}   	Improving	360	Degree	Photos:	Using	deep	neural	networks,	the company	has	been	adjusting	the	orientation	of	photos	to	provide	a better	viewing	experience	for	users.{225}   	Computer	Vision:	Facebook	has	also	been	developing	a	method for	computer	analysis	that	can	understand	images.	While	it	is	just starting	to	use	AI	for	computer	vision,	the	company	has	stated	that it	has	been	researching	computer	vision-related	topics	including computational	photography,	visual	dialogue,	content	and	image understanding,	virtual	reality	and	even	satellite	images.{226}   	Facebook	Personal	Assistant	M:	Facebook	Messenger	now  offers	an	option	for	a	personal	assistant	called	Facebook	M,	which can	provide	users	with	recommendations	to	enhance	their experiences.	For	example,	it	can	remind	users	to	save	information to	review	later,	and	send	users	birthday	reminders.	M	can	also recommend	video	or	voice	calls	that	can	be	completed	right	in	the app.	However,	these	features	are	not	yet	available	to	all	users.{227}  	Facebook	Messenger	Platform	Chatbots:	Facebook	Messenger  also	has	a	platform	for	chatbots.	This	is	one	of	the	most	popular chatbot	platforms	today	and	is	covered	in	more	detail	in	the	chapter about	chatbots.  AI	Companies	Facebook	Has	Acquired  To	accomplish	all	of	these	achievements	Facebook	has	been	developing its	own	AI,	but	has	also	purchased	some	significant	AI	companies.	One of	those	is	Ozlo,	which	is	a	conversational	AI	developer.	The	company became	known	for	its	consumer-facing	app	and	its	knowledge	graph,	a database	of	facts	about	the	world.{228}  Facebook	has	also	acquired	Wit.ai,	which	deals	in	API	 application programming	interface 	development	and	voice-activated	AI	interfaces. {229}	In	addition,	Masquerade	Technologies,	which	develops	facial   recognition	technology,	and	Zurich	Eye,	a	computer	vision	company, have	also	been	added	to	Facebook's	AI	arsenal.{230}  Facebook’s	AI	Research	Activities  Facebook	has	a	research	division	devoted	exclusively	to	artificial intelligence,	which	is	called	Facebook	AI	Research	 FAIR .	FAIR’s website	shares	articles,	news,	and	insights	on	how	Facebook	is	working with	AI-related	technologies.	On	this	site	you	can	also	read	AI-related publications	written	by	FAIR	researchers	and	download	different	machine learning	or	deep	learning	models.

Facebook	AI	Research	 FAIR 	Website.  https:  research.fb.com category facebook-ai-research-fair  	  Facebook	has	recently	opened	a	research	lab	in	Montreal	where scientists	and	engineers	will	work	on	a	variety	of	AI	projects.	Known	as FAIR	Montreal,	it	is	designed	to	examine	all	aspects	of	AI	issues,   including	applications,	both	software	and	hardware	components,	and	how to	get	knowledge	from	data.{231}		Interestingly,	Google	has	opened	an	AI research	base	in	Montreal	as	well.  Facebook’s	CEO	and	founder	Mark	Zuckerberg	believes	that	eventually AI	will	be	better	than	humans	at	almost	every	task	and	shares	these insights	on	the	topic:  “I've	previously	predicted	that	within	5-10	years	we'll	have	AI	systems that	are	more	accurate	than	people	for	each	of	our	senses	--	vision, hearing,	touch,	etc.,	as	well	as	things	like	language.	It's	impressive	how powerful	the	state	of	the	art	for	these	tools	is	becoming,	and	this	year makes	me	more	confident	in	my	prediction.  In	a	way,	AI	is	both	closer	and	further	off	than	we	imagine.	AI	is	closer	to being	able	to	do	more	powerful	things	than	most	people	expect	--	driving cars,	curing	diseases,	discovering	planets,	understanding	media.	Those will	each	have	a	great	impact	on	the	world,	but	we're	still	figuring	out what	real	intelligence	is.”{232}  	   73.	What	Are	Amazon’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Amazon’s	exceptionally	popular	e-commerce	platform,	Amazon.com,	has been	implementing	machine	learning	technology	for	quite	a	long	time.	It is	machine	learning	that	enables	Amazon.com	to	recommend	similar products	when	customers	purchase	something,	or	send	relevant promotions	to	users	who	viewed	certain	products	but	didn’t	buy	them.  Amazon	is	clearly	one	of	the	forerunners	in	the	way	it	leverages	the productivity	and	efficiency	advantages	created	by	the	use	of	robots, which	in	turn	allows	the	company	to	offer	better	customer	features	like fast	delivery.	In	fact,	according	to	the	latest	reports,	there	are	currently over	100,000	orange	robots	in	use	at	Amazon	warehouses	and	over 1,000	employees	who	build,	program,	and	work	beside	them.{233}  	   Figure	8.6.	Amazon	Warehouse	Robot.   Image	Credit:	Amazon	Pressroom   	  Amazon	is	pouring	resources	into	artificial	intelligence	development	in many	other	areas	as	well.	From	drone	deliveries	to	personal	assistant Alexa,	as	well	as	customer	data	research,	the	company	has	been	finding various	ways	to	enhance	their	products	and	services	through	the employment	of	AI.  Practical	Uses	of	Artificial	Intelligence	at	Amazon  Amazon	has	been	employing	AI	to	enhance	some	of	its	e-commerce  and	Internet	services.	Some	of	the	ways	it	has	been	using	the technology	include:   	Amazon	Recommended	Products:	One	of	Amazon’s	top	behind-  the-scenes	applications	of	AI	is	its	ability	to	gather	and	analyze customer	data	to	make	more	accurate	product	suggestions.	For Amazon	and	its	suppliers,	keeping	consumers	spending	is	key,	and AI	has	been	helping	them	keep	the	orders	pouring	in.   	Alexa	Personal	Assistant:	Amazon's	personal	assistant	has recently	been	given	a	boost	with	the	addition	of	Echo,	a	digital speaker	device	that	makes	interaction	with	Alexa	even	easier. Speech	activated	Echo Alexa	can	be	used	to	search	for	information like	the	time	or	the	weather,	to	play	music,	and	for	many	other tasks.{234}   	Cloud	Storage:	AI	has	been	applied	to	Amazon’s	cloud	storage  service	to	help	secure	data.	Called	Amazon	Macie,	it	uses	machine learning	to	find,	sort	and	protect	confidential	information.	Macie	was created	in	reaction	to	a	security	breach	that	occurred	on	Amazon S3,	the	company’s	simple	cloud	storage	service,	when	over	60,000 sensitive	files	belonging	to	the	U.S.	government	became	accessible to	the	general	public.	Thanks	to	AI,	the	more	sophisticated	Macie can	now	search	out	this	type	of	confidential	data	and	secure	it,	as   well	as	track	how	the	data	is	accessed	in	order	to	detect	any suspicious	activity.{235}  Amazon’s	AI	Cloud	Services	for	Companies  Amazon	will	be	one	of	the	most	competitive	companies	to	offer	its artificial	intelligence	services	to	businesses,	much	like	Google,	Microsoft and	IBM	are	already	doing.	For	a	long	time,	Amazon	has	been	a	provider of	website	hosting	services	for	many	corporate	clients,	and	is	now starting	to	offer	AI	capabilities	for	other	companies	as	well.  For	example,	Intuit,	the	financial	software	company	behind	some	popular financial	products	such	as	TurboTax,	uses	Amazon’s	AI	platform	to	inject machine	learning	into	its	products.{236}  Amazon’s	AI	platform	offers	these	core	products	and	services	to companies:   	Amazon	Lex:	Allows	you	to	build	powerful	chatbots	with	audio  capabilities.	It	works	with	the	same	technology	that	powers	Amazon Alexa	and	uses	automatic	speech	recognition	 ASR 	and	natural language	understanding	 NLU .   	Amazon	Polly:	Text	to	speech	service	that	allows	you	to	create  applications	that	speak	in	several	languages.   	Amazon	Recognition:	Allows	you	to	add	image	analysis	to	any  application.  I’m	quite	sure	that	Amazon’s	AI	platform	will	be	very	popular	among	all types	of	businesses,	especially	small	and	medium-sized	ones	that understand	the	importance	of	starting	to	work	with	artificial	intelligence. You	can	find	more	information	at:	https:  aws.amazon.com amazon-ai  	   Figure	8.7.	Amazon’s	AI	Platform. https:  aws.amazon.com amazon-ai  	  Although	the	company	already	has	AI	running	on	most	of	its	products,	it is	still	counting	on	future	developments	in	AI	to	enhance	its	offerings.  According	to	Amazon	CEO	Jeff	Bezos,	AI	is	vital	to	the	company’s success:  “Machine	learning	drives	our	algorithms	for	demand	forecasting,	product search	ranking,	product	and	deals	recommendations,	merchandising placements,	fraud	detection,	translations,	and	much	more.	Though	less visible,	much	of	the	impact	of	machine	learning	will	be	of	this	type	-- quietly	but	meaningfully	improving	core	operations.”{237}  Bezos	has	also	said	that	he	believes	AI	is	going	to	be	the	key	to	making all	businesses	and	governments	better.{238}  Matt	Wood,	General	Manager	of	Deep	Learning	and	AI	for	Amazon	Web Services	 AWS ,	mentioned	recently	that	the	online	e-commerce	giant has	the	biggest	AI	platform	in	the	world.{239}  	   74.	What	Are	Microsoft’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Microsoft,	one	of	the	most	well-known	and	traditional	tech	companies, has	been	making	a	lot	of	transitions	lately	by	moving	away	from traditional	software	and	into	selling	cloud-based	services.	In	May	of	2017 the	company	announced	some	impressive	numbers,	having	500	million monthly	active	users	of	Windows	10,	100	million	commercial	users	of Office	365,	and	140	million	monthly	active	users	of	Cortana	 Microsoft’s personal	assistant .{240}  In	recent	years	the	company	has	also	placed	less	of	a	priority	on	mobile developments	and	increased	its	focus	on	artificial	intelligence	research and	development.	In	fact,	under	the	leadership	of	CEO	Satya	Nadella, Microsoft	has	been	integrating	AI	into	most	of	its	products.	In	one	of	its recent	annual	reports,	the	company	indicated	the	shift	by	adding	artificial intelligence	into	its	core	vision	statement	and	removing	references	to mobile	development.	This	basically	means	that	Microsoft	will	implement AI	in	all	of	its	future	products.{241}  Microsoft	has	also	been	investing	heavily	in	AI	development,	which signals	that	it	is	hoping	to	revitalize	its	product	line.	The	company’s	aim	is to	reclaim	the	success	it	enjoyed	many	years	ago	as	the	top	name	in	the personal	computer	industry.  This	ambition	is	evidenced	by	the	strategic	hiring	it	has	been	doing recently.	Microsoft	has	starting	working	with	well-known	AI	and	deep learning	expert	Yoshua	Bengio,	who	has	agreed	to	serve	as	a	strategic advisor	to	the	company	and	is	expected	to	help	place	Microsoft	as	the third	biggest	AI	company.{242}  How	Microsoft	Is	Applying	Artificial	Intelligence  There	are	several	products	that	Microsoft	has	been	developing	and improving	using	AI,	including:   	Cortana:	The	company’s	personal	digital	assistant	has	been	quite  stable	as	one	of	the	most	popular	ones	in	the	category.	It	uses	AI	to   learn	from,	and	adapt	to,	tasks	assigned	by	users.	Cortana	can remind	users	of	appointments	or	activities	with	either	time-based	or location-based	specifics.	It	is	also	able	to	find	information	upon request	and	coordinate	information	among	a	variety	of	popular apps.

IBM	is	over	100	years	old	and	its	current	flagship	is	Watson,	an	AI phenomenon	that	fascinated	the	world	after	beating	2	human	champion players	on	the	TV	game	show	Jeopardy!	in	2011.	Watson’s	development began	in	2005	after	researchers	had	already	decided	in	2004	that	they would	build	it	to	compete	on	Jeopardy!.	After	collecting	the	$1	million	in prize	money	from	the	game	show,	IBM	got	to	work	expanding	Watson’s capabilities,	to	which	the	company	often	refers	as	“cognitive	computing” rather	than	AI.{248}  Since	then	Watson,	which	was	originally	stored	on	several	servers	and	is now	located	in	the	cloud,	has	made	tremendous	progress,	most	notably in	the	medical	field.	Watson’s	resume	now	boasts	many	important contributions	to	society,	rather	than	just	“game	show	contestant.”  Although	Watson	is	now	being	used	in	17	industries,	including	retail,	law, music	and	hospitality,	Watson	has	been	particularly	successful	in	the	field of	medicine,	applying	its	“cognitive	computing”	or	AI	power	to	enhance the	proficiencies	of	physicians.	For	example,	one	of	the	biggest developments	for	IBM	has	been	Watson	Oncology,	a	program	introduced in	2013	that	allows	doctors	to	use	Watson	to	help	them	make	the	best possible	diagnoses	and	treatment	plans	for	cancer	patients.{249}  In	a	study	conducted	by	the	University	of	North	Carolina’s	School	of Medicine,	Watson	was	given	1,000	cancer	cases	to	analyze.	In	99 percent	of	these	cases,	Watson’s	recommended	patient	treatment	plans matched	those	suggested	by	physicians.	In	addition,	The	AI	superstar offered	options	that	doctors	overlooked	about	30	percent	of	the	time. Largely	attributed	to	its	superior	processing	power,	Watson	was	able	to incorporate	research	papers	and	clinical	trials	that	doctors	may	have missed	or	not	known	about.{250}  IBM’s	Watson	has	also	been	contributing	to	the	world	of	medicine	by partnering	with	Quest	Diagnostics	to	form	IBM	Watson	Genomics	from Quest	Diagnostics.	This	is	a	highly	advanced	genomic	sequencing service	designed	to	help	oncologists	provide	cancer	patients	with	the most	precise	treatment	possible.   A	large	part	of	Watson’s	success	in	being	so	invaluable	to	the	medical community	has	been	attributed	to	the	reportedly	$4	billion	IBM	has	spent buying	up	companies	that	deal	in	medical	data.{251}  Watson’s	contributions	are	not	limited	to	the	field	of	medicine.	Following are	some	examples	of	other	areas	in	which	Watson	has	been	making	its mark	on	society.   	Watson	Analytics:	IBM	has	also	excelled	at	visualization.	Using	its  AI	expertise,	it	has	designed	a	system	that	can	discover relationships,	correlations	and	outlooks	from	datasets.	These	can help	businesses	garner	useful	information	from	their	data,	including trends	and	forecasts	for	their	companies.	Website: www.ibm.com watson-analytics   	Enterprising	Watson:	To	further	expand	its	reach,	IBM	has	been  looking	to	make	strategic	connections	with	other	companies.	To that	end,	it	has	partnered	with	Salesforce,	which	will	render information	from	Watson	available	on	Salesforce’s	customer service	platform	dubbed	“Einstein.”{252}   	Watson	in	Education:	Watson	has	even	been	helping	to	train  university	students.	Georgia	Tech	has	released	“Jill	Watson,”	an	AI teaching	assistant.	This	AI	assistant	was	developed	by	Professor Ashok	Goel	and	a	team	of	Georgia	Tech	graduate	students	to	help answer	the	questions	from	students	taking	an	online	Georgia	Tech course.	Although	not	an	IBM	product,	Jill	Watson	is	based	on	IBM’s Watson	platform.{253}  Chairman,	president	and	CEO	of	IBM	Ginni	Rometty	has	said	that	she expects	Watson	to	reach	over	one	billion	people.  “Within	a	few	years,	every	major	decision	–	personal	or	business	–	will	be made	with	the	help	of	AI	and	cognitive	technologies,”	she	has	been quoted	as	saying.{254}  It	has	also	been	estimated	that	Watson	will	bring	in	$6	billion	by	2020	and $17	billion	by	2022	for	the	company.   IBM	AI	Cloud	Services  IBM	offers	powerful	cloud-based	AI	services	for	both	large	and	small businesses.	These	services	enable	companies	to	build	AI	products	and services	using	computer	vision,	image	recognition	and	speech recognition	tools	that	are	similar	to	those	offered	by	Amazon. Additionally,	IBM	provides	AI-based	data	insight	services,	which	can	be helpful	in	market	research.  Try	Free	Demonstrations	to	See	How	Watson’s	AI	Works  IBM	offers	a	variety	of	Watson	products	and	services,	all	of	which implement	AI.	Included	below	are	demos	for	four	of	the	most	interesting ones	that	you	can	test	out	for	yourself	to	determine	potential	applications:   	Tone	Analyzer:	Uses	linguistic	analysis	to	identify	emotions  conveyed	in	written	text.

You	can	find	detailed	information	about	it	at:	www.ibm.com us- en marketplace deep-learning-platform  IBM’s	Chief	Technology	Officer	Rob	High	refers	to	Watson,	and	AI	in general,	as	“augmented	intelligence.”	He	says	that	it	is	not	so	much about	fooling	someone	into	thinking	they	are	dealing	with	another	human, but	instead	training	the	machine	to	solve	complex	problems	in	the	way	a human	mind	would.	In	that	respect,	IBM	has	been	a	pioneer	in	the	world of	AI	and	its	ability	to	solve	many	practical	problems	for	the	world, especially	in	the	field	of	health	care.{255}  IBM’s	AI	Research  IBM	has	developed	a	number	of	resources	for	AI	research,	also	known as	cognitive	computing	research.	On	the	company’s	main	research website,	you	can	learn	about	their	primary	research	areas	and	their partnerships,	and	also	read	insightful	articles	and	watch	TED	Talks	by some	of	the	cognitive	computing	experts	at	IBM.

What	Are	Apple’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  For	years,	Apple’s	iOS	has	been	one	of	the	primary	operating	systems	in the	smartphone	industry,	together	with	Google’s	Android.	However,	some experts	believe	that	Apple	may	be	falling	behind	in	the	race	for	artificial intelligence	leadership,	with	Google	and	Amazon	outpacing	Apple	in	AI research	and	development,	and	possibly	dominating	in	the	area	of	AI operating	systems	as	well.{256}  Some	believe	that	Apple’s	personal	assistant,	Siri,	is	significantly	less effective	than	its	competitors	like	Google	Assistant	or	Microsoft’s Cortana.{257}		At	the	same	time,	however,	it	is	important	to	note	that	Siri	is currently	the	most	widely	used	personal	assistant.	Although	it	can	still only	handle	simple	requests,	hopefully	Siri	will	become	much	more powerful	in	the	near	future.  How	Apple	Is	Applying	Artificial	Intelligence	to	its	Products  All	of	Apple’s	future	products	will	likely	be	powered	by	AI,	but	here	are some	of	the	ways	in	which	artificial	intelligence	is	currently	being employed	in	Apple	products:   	Speech	Recognition	on	Siri:	Apple’s	personal	assistant	tool,	Siri,  is	able	to	understand	basic	human	speech	in	several	different languages.   	QuickType:	When	typing	something	on	your	iPhone	or	iPad,  Apple’s	QuickType	offers	predictive	suggestions	for	the	words	you might	be	typing.	Because	of	machine	learning,	this	feature	also becomes	increasingly	smarter	the	more	you	use	it,	and	is	even	able to	learn	your	own	unique	conversational	style.   	iPhone	8	and	iPhone	X:	The	iPhone	X	includes	an	“A11	Bionic  chip,”	which	was	custom	built	by	Apple	to	manage	AI-related	tasks. Inside	this	chip	is	a	“neural	engine,”	which	manages	machine learning	algorithms	to	power	many	of	the	advanced	features	of	the   iPhone	X.	This	same	chip	also	provides	iPhone	app	developers with	the	ability	to	include	AI	in	their	new	apps.{258}   	Apple	Music:	The	Apple	Music	service	also	uses	machine	learning  to	gain	an	understanding	of	the	kinds	of	music	we	prefer	so	that	it can	offer	suggestions	for	additional	music	we	might	enjoy.	This	is similar	to	the	way	in	which	Netflix	is	able	to	offer	suggested	viewing content	to	its	customers.   	Apple	HomePod:	The	initial	version	of	the	HomePod	speaker	does not	include	an	advanced	AI	assistant.	Instead,	Apple	is	promoting	it as	providing	superior	sound	quality	while	using	AI-powered microphones	to	determine	the	best	ways	to	shape	the	sound coming	out	of	the	speaker.{259}   	Apple	Photos	App:	Due	to	improvements	that	have	been	made	to  the	Apple	Photos	app,	this	software	now	offers	facial	recognition, and	can	also	analyze	your	photos	to	determine	which	ones	are	the best,	making	photo	management	much	easier.{260}  AI	Startups	Acquired	by	Apple  As	of	this	writing,	Apple	has	not	been	able	to	acquire	any	significant	AI companies.	In	contrast,	Google’s	purchase	of	DeepMind	in	2014	has given	the	company	a	huge	boost	in	its	AI	research	and	development capabilities.  Apple	has	been	able	to	acquire	some	AI-based	startups,	however,	which include:   	Lattice	Data,	which	specializes	in	the	transformation	of	unstructured  dark	data	into	structured	data.   	Emotient,	which	uses	AI	to	recognize	emotions	by	reading	facial   	SensoMotoric	Instruments,	which	offers	AI-powered	eye-tracking  expressions.  technology.   	Regaind,	a	computer	vision	startup.   Core	ML	–	Machine	Learning	Framework	for	App	Developers  Core	ML	is	a	new	machine	learning	framework	created	by	Apple	that allows	developers	to	easily	create	apps	leveraging	machine	learning technologies.	According	to	their	website,	this	framework	is	designed	to	be used	across	Apple	products	and	features	like	Siri	and	QuickType.	You can	learn	more	at:	https:  developer.apple.com machine-learning   Project	Titan	–	Apple’s	Self-Driving	Car	Component  Although	Apple	has	been	working	on	self-driving	car	technologies,	there is	currently	very	little	information	about	it	that	has	been	confirmed	and shared	with	the	public.	This	project,	which	has	been	code-named	“Project Titan,”	appears	to	be	focused	on	the	development	of	a	self-driving component	that	would	be	installed	into	the	roof	rack	of	a	vehicle.{261}  Rather	than	trying	to	build	a	self-driving	car	from	the	ground	up,	which would	be	exceedingly	expensive	and	time-consuming,	especially considering	the	head	start	that	other	tech	and	car	companies	have,	Apple is	taking	quite	a	unique	approach.	If	Project	Titan	is	successful,	it	could be	a	significant	product	for	the	auto	industry.  Apple’s	AI	Research	Activity  In	comparison	with	other	tech	giants,	Apple	has	not	been	as	active	in research	geared	toward	artificial	intelligence.	In	fact,	the	company’s	first AI	research	paper	was	published	only	in	December	of	2016.{262}  Also,	Apple	did	not	hire	its	first	director	of	AI	research	until	October	of 2016,	when	it	brought	on	board	Ruslan	Salakhutdinov,	a	deep	learning expert	from	Carnegie	Mellon	University.{263}  The	fact	that	Apple	got	started	later	than	many	other	companies	could	be an	indication	that	its	AI	technologies	will	also	run	further	behind.  Still,	AI	is	at	the	heart	of	many	of	Apple’s	products,	including	the	Apple Watch,	iPhone,	HomePod	smart	speaker,	and	Apple	TV.	As	they continue	to	create	and	refine	their	product	lines,	it	will	be	interesting	to see	whether	Apple	can	keep	up	with	Amazon	and	Google	in	the	race	to lead	AI	applications	in	technology.   You	can	read	more	about	the	machine	learning	research	happening	at Apple	in	the	company’s	Machine	Learning	Journal,	found	at https:  machinelearning.apple.com  	  	  Figure	8.10.	Apple	Machine	Learning	Journal.  https:  machinelearning.apple.com   77.	What	Are	Nvidia’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Nvidia	is	an	American	tech	company	that,	although	not	known	about	by many	people,	is	becoming	an	extremely	powerful	player	in	the	world	of artificial	intelligence.	Based	in	Santa	Clara,	California,	Nvidia’s	major presence	in	the	AI	industry	is	mostly	behind-the	scenes,	as	its	products and	services	cater	to	other	companies	rather	than	individual	consumers.  Originally,	Nvidia’s	primary	product	was	graphics	processing	units  GPUs ,	which	were	used	to	power	video	game	systems	such	as	Sega, Xbox	and	PS3.	Today,	Nvidia’s	main	priority	is	making	GPUs	known	as “AI	chips”	for	other	companies	that	are	building	AI-powered	products. These	chips	are	a	sort	of	supercomputing	hardware	that	can	handle	the most	demanding	and	complex	computational	executions.  Enormous	quantities	of	these	AI	chips	are	being	used	in	the	data	centers of	big	technology	giants	like	Amazon,	Google,	Facebook	and	Microsoft. {264}		Although	Nvidia	provides	AI	chips	to	power	innumerable	devices	for many	different	companies,	its	most	important	contribution	to	AI	is probably	in	the	self-driving	car	industry.  Nvidia	is	a	key	player	in	the	self-driving	car	industry,	having	established strategic	partnerships	with	most	of	the	top	brands.	In	addition	to	being	the leading	company	powering	the	driverless	car	industry,	Nvidia	also	aspires to	be	the	top	provider	of	AI	chips	for	a	wide	variety	of	other	sectors	that will	be	AI-powered	in	the	future.	Examples	of	such	industries	would	be retail,	health	care,	robotics,	smart	cities	and	warehousing,	just	to	name	a few.{265}  Nvidia	CEO	Jensen	Huang	was	quoted	as	saying:  “AI	is	one	of	the	most	important	inventions	in	the	history	of	humanity.	Its potential	to	bring	joy,	productivity	is	surely	unquestionable,	but	you	could also	imagine	these	powerful	technologies	used	in	improper	ways.”{266}  “We	at	Nvidia	believe	that	the	best	way	to	keep	the	tech	in	good	hands	is to	democratise	it.	That's	why	Nvidia's	GPU	technology,	and	CUDA,	are   open.	It's	in	every	single	cloud,	it's	in	every	single	computer	and	we	make it	available	to	anybody	who	wants	to	use	it.”{267}  Although	there	are	other	companies	competing	in	this	same	space,	like Intel	and	Qualcomm,	Nvidia	has	a	good	head	start	to	becoming	the indisputable	market	leader.	Silicon	Valley	Venture	capitalist	Marc Andreessen	was	quoted	as	saying,	“It's	like	when	people	were	all building	on	Windows	in	the	'90s	or	all	building	on	the	iPhone	in	the	late 2000s.”	Today,	Nvidia	is	the	main	platform	being	used	by	virtually	all startups	and	companies	building	AI-powered	products.{268}  Nvidia’s	AI	Training  To	keep	up	with	the	demand	for	AI,	which	has	been	growing	at	a staggering	pace,	Nvidia	has	created	the	Deep	Learning	Institute,	which aims	to	train	about	1,000	new	deep	learning	developers	per	year.{269}		The Deep	Learning	Institute	offers	free,	self-paced	online	courses	for	data scientists	and	developers,	providing	an	excellent	opportunity	for	those who	wish	to	work	in	this	field.	You	can	see	the	courses	offered	at: https:  www.nvidia.com en-us deep-learning-ai education   	  	   Figure	8.11.	Nvidia’s	Deep	Learning	Institute.	https:  www.nvidia.com en-  us deep-learning-ai education  	  Among	producers	and	suppliers	of	AI	chips,	Nvidia	is	poised	to	be	the unquestionable	market	leader.	Thanks	to	the	partnerships	it	has	formed with	the	most	important	self-driving	car	companies,	Nvidia	has	a	huge competitive	advantage	over	competitors	such	as	Intel	and	Qualcomm. Nvidia	will	also	probably	be	the	number	one	AI	chip	provider	for	smart appliances	and	other	products	that	will	be	developed	to	work	with	the Internet	of	Things.	In	essence,	Nvidia	may	quietly	become	the	most powerful	tech	company	of	them	all,	even	including	the	famous	giants	we have	all	come	to	know	as	household	names.	As	the	hidden	force	making it	possible	for	other	tech	companies	to	successfully	do	their	work	in	AI development,	one	might	even	call	Nvidia	“the	power	behind	the	power.”  	   78.	What	Are	Alibaba’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  As	the	largest	online	retail	company	in	China,	and	possibly	even	the world,	Alibaba	handles	huge	quantities	of	data	on	their	e-commerce websites.	Like	another	retail	giant,	Amazon,	Alibaba	uses	artificial intelligence	to	improve	every	aspect	of	a	customer’s	shopping experience.  For	example,	with	the	help	of	AI	technology,	Alibaba	offers	personalized product	recommendations,	customized	storefronts	showcasing information	to	shoppers	based	on	their	unique	preferences,	and	many other	subtle	features	that	can	help	consumers	find	and	purchase	more products	they	might	be	interested	in.{270}  How	Alibaba	Applies	Artificial	Intelligence   	Robots	Run	the	Warehouses:	Similar	to	e-commerce	giant  Amazon,	Alibaba	uses	smart	robots	in	its	warehouses	to	increase operational	efficiency.	According	to	the	website	Business	Insider, robots	currently	handle	up	to	70	percent	of	the	work	done	in Alibaba’s	warehouses,	can	carry	loads	up	to	500	kilograms  approximately	1100	pounds 	in	weight,	and	use	specialized sensors	to	avoid	collisions.{271}		This	is	a	prime	example	of	how	this e-commerce	leader	in	China	is	taking	advantage	of	the opportunities	afforded	by	robots	to	promote	company	growth.   	AI-Powered	Product	Recommendation	Algorithm:	Alibaba’s  algorithm	for	product	recommendations	examines	product	reviews and	website	user	behavior	to	make	smart	product	suggestions.{272}	 This	feature	is	similar	to	the	one	implemented	by	Amazon	and helps	Alibaba	to	generate	more	online	sales.   	AI-Powered	Drone	Deliveries:	Alibaba	has	started	using	drones	to  deliver	packages.	In	October	of	2017,	in	a	versatility	experiment, Alibaba	managed	to	achieve	drone	delivery	of	packages	over	open water	for	the	first	time.	These	packages,	which	weighed	a combined	total	of	roughly	12	kilograms	 approximately	26.5   pounds 	were	carried	by	the	drones	for	a	distance	of	about	5.5 kilometers	 3.4	miles .{273}		Alibaba	says	that	in	the	future	it	hopes	to also	be	able	to	deliver	items	like	fresh	food	and	medical	supplies.   	Fashion	AI	Shopping	Consultant:	Alibaba	has	developed	a powerful	new	AI-based	service,	called	FashionAI,	designed	to increase	sales	in	brick-and-mortar	retail	stores.	Comprised	of several	different	AI	technologies,	the	FashionAI	system	is	installed into	clothing	store	dressing	rooms.	A	screen	in	the	dressing	room can	recognize	the	articles	of	clothing	the	customer	has	brought	in based	on	tiny	sensors	embedded	into	the	garments.	The	screen then	uses	this	information	to	suggest	matching	clothing	or accessories,	or	outfits	in	a	similar	style,	for	the	customer	to	try	on. {274}		The	customer	can	even	push	a	button	on	the	screen	to	call	a salesperson	to	bring	these	items	to	the	dressing	room.  There	are	currently	13	stores	around	the	country	that	offer	this specialized	user	experience.	When	this	kind	of	technology	is adopted	on	a	larger	scale,	it	will	offer	companies	new	ways	to	drive profits,	encouraging	customers	to	visit	traditional	shopping	centers in	addition	to	shopping	online.	This	is	a	perfect	example	of	a practical	application	of	computer	vision	and	other	AI	technologies to	provide	an	easier,	more	personalized	shopping	experience.   	Customer	Service	Chatbot:	Alibaba	has	also	created	an  impressive	chatbot	to	help	their	customers	have	quick	and	effective experiences	with	customer	service.	For	example,	when	you	make	a call	to	Alibaba,	you	don’t	actually	speak	with	a	human,	but	rather with	Ali	Xiaomi,	Alibaba’s	assistant	chatbot,	which	can	answer	both spoken	and	written	inquiries.	Ali	Xiaomi	can	be	used	to	deal	with concerns	about	transactions,	answer	frequently	asked	questions, and	offer	product	recommendations.	According	to	Alibaba,	this customer	service	chatbot	is	equipped	to	handle	up	to	95	percent	of the	queries	that	come	in	for	customer	service.{275}   	Powerful	Computational	Engine:	Alibaba	has	a	particularly  powerful	computational	engine	that	allows	the	company	to	quickly   complete	even	the	most	complex	AI	functions,	such	as	processing over	175,000	transactions	in	a	single	second.{276}  Alibaba’s	AI	Research  Alibaba	Innovative	Research	 AIR 	focuses	on	a	number	of	key technologies	and	future	applications,	including	machine	learning	and natural	language	processing.  Alibaba’s	Damo	Academy,	which	focuses	on	AI	research	and development,	will	also	be	creating	new	laboratories	to	expand	their capabilities	in	mainland	China,	the	U.S.,	Russia,	Singapore,	and	Israel. {277}  	  Figure	8.12.	Alibaba’s	AI	Research	and	Development	Website.  https:  102.alibaba.com news index  Role	in	China’s	National	AI	Team  	  The	Ministry	of	Science	and	Technology	in	China	recently	created	the country’s	first	national	artificial	intelligence	team,	charged	with	the	task	of   making	China	the	world	leader	in	AI	by	the	year	2030.	Alibaba	has	been invited	to	participate	in	this	effort,	in	addition	to	other	corporate	leaders	in China	like	Baidu	and	Tencent.	Alibaba’s	current	assignment	in	this endeavor	is	a	project	known	as	“city	brains,”	which	aims	to	use	AI solutions	such	as	smart	transportation	to	help	improve	urban	life.{278}  	   79.	What	Are	Baidu’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Baidu	is	one	of	the	largest	companies	employing	AI	technology	in	China. With	its	most	well-known	product	being	China’s	biggest	search	engine, Baidu	has	access	to	vast	amounts	of	user	search	data.	This	gives	the company	leverage	similar	to	that	of	Google	in	the	Western	world, affording	it	the	advantage	of	being	able	to	understand	consumers’	buying habits.	Baidu	has	plans	to	incorporate	AI	technologies	into	its	search engine	in	the	near	future.	This	will	even	better	enable	it	to	provide suggestions	based	on	users’	searches.  Baidu	is	also	investing	heavily	in	the	technologies	behind	self-driving	cars and	has	already	released	a	free	operating	system	for	self-driving	auto manufacturers	called	Apollo.	The	company	has	also	entered	into	a partnership	with	another	leader	in	the	self-driving	vehicle	industry,	Nvidia, which	will	give	Baidu	further	access	to	pertinent	research	data	and	a commanding	lead	over	its	competitors.{279}  Additionally,	Baidu	is	a	recognized	leader	in	AI-powered	facial	recognition systems,	which	have	already	been	tested	in	some	cities	in	China,	serving as	an	entry	pass	for	tourists	into	their	hotels.{280}	These	kinds	of	biometric facial	recognition	technologies	will	soon	be	implemented	in	hotels	and airports	around	the	world,	while	also	being	used	to	increase	travel	safety, reduce	wait	times,	and	assist	with	crime	solving.  According	to	Baidu,	its	facial	detection	programs	are	more	accurate	than a	human	could	be	at	manually	checking	identification.	While	there	are many	companies	attempting	to	sell	facial	recognition	technologies	to airports,	hotels	and	other	tourist	sites,	Baidu	has	a	clear	lead	in	this regard.	However,	some	detractors	say	that	there	may	be	privacy	issues at	stake	when	such	a	large	commercial	company	has	access	to	and control	over	so	much	of	our	personal	data.{281}  Smart	Speaker	and	Robots  Baidu	recently	launched	a	smart	speaker	called	Raven	H.	Just	like Amazon	Echo	and	Google	Home,	it	can	do	all	the	same	basic	tasks	as   the	other	leading	home	personal	assistants,	such	as	playing	music	or getting	the	weather	forecast.	However,	unlike	the	others,	Raven	H	is equipped	with	DuerOS,	an	advanced	voice	technology	that	enables	the user	to	move	around	the	home	and	still	stay	connected	to	the	device.{282}  Baidu	has	also	created	a	home	robot	called	Raven	R,	which	is	reported to	have	emotional	intelligence.	This	robot	is	powered	by	AI	tools	such	as computer	vision,	facial	recognition,	and	the	company’s	own	Apollo autonomous	driving	technology.{283}	At	the	time	of	this	writing,	it	has	yet	to be	announced	when	Raven	R	will	be	available	for	sale	or	how	much	it	will cost.  Baidu’s	AI	Research  Baidu’s	leadership	role	in	AI	research	dates	back	to	2013,	when	it opened	its	first	AI	laboratory	in	Silicon	Valley.	Currently,	over	1,300	AI researchers	work	for	Baidu.	This	team	was	formerly	led	by	Andrew	NG, the	foremost	expert	on	artificial	intelligence,	which	has	given	the company	additional	advantages	in	their	AI	programs.{284}  You	can	learn	more	about	the	company’s	current	research	initiatives	by visiting	http:  research.baidu.com	Baidu	also	hosts	a	website	with information	about	its	AI	products	and	services,	but	this	site	is	currently offered	only	in	the	Chinese	language	at	http:  ai.baidu.com   	   Figure	8.13.	Baidu’s	Research	Website.  http:  research.baidu.com  Role	in	China’s	National	AI	Team  	  Baidu’s	role	in	the	national	AI	team	backed	by	the	Chinese	government will	be	to	focus	on	the	development	and	implementation	of	self-driving cars.	This	role	was	wisely	chosen,	as	Baidu	has	been	long	recognized	as a	leader	in	self-driving	car	technologies	in	Asia.{285}  	   80.	What	Are	Tencent’s	Artificial	Intelligence Activities?  Tencent	is	the	company	behind	the	largest	social	media	network	in China.	This	company	offers	products	and	services	related	to	social media,	maps,	mail,	entertainment,	gambling,	video	streaming,	gaming, and	education.  As	the	creator	of	WeChat,	Tencent	is	another	major	player	in	the	world	of artificial	intelligence.	This	company	is	currently	worth	more	than	$300 billion.	In	addition	to	implementing	AI	technologies	in	its	instant messaging	app,	WeChat,	Tencent	is	working	on	a	variety	of	other	AI technologies,	including	image	recognition	and	self-driving	cars.  WeChat	is	more	deeply	integrated	into	its	users’	daily	activities	than	other popular	instant	messengers	like	WhatsApp	and	Facebook	Messenger. With	WeChat,	you	can	do	things	like	order	a	taxi,	shop	online,	read	the news,	send	money	to	a	friend,	and	many	other	activities.	WeChat	is striving	to	be	the	only	app	anyone	needs	in	China.  Thanks	to	the	daily	activities	of	millions	of	WeChat	users,	Tencent	has access	to	enormous	amounts	of	data	regarding	its	customers’	personal habits.	According	to	many	experts,	this	kind	of	data	is	more	valuable	than the	search	data	Baidu	has	or	the	e-commerce	data	available	to	Alibaba, which	puts	Tencent	in	an	excellent	position	to	create	cutting-edge	AI products	and	services.{286}  Tencent’s	AI	Research  Tencent	has	opened	an	AI	laboratory	in	Seattle	and	is	investing	heavily	in AI	research	and	development	projects.{287}	In	addition	to	having	its	own	AI lab,	Tencent	has	also	started	investing	in	a	number	of	AI-related	startups. Tencent’s	AI	research	focuses	on	machine	learning,	computer	vision, speech	recognition	and	natural	language	processing,	and	their	potential applications	for	gaming,	social	and	content-based	products,	and	AI platforms.	More	information	can	be	found	about	the	company’s	AI research,	along	with	some	publications	in	English,	at: http:  ai.tencent.com ailab index.html   	  Figure	8.14.	Tencent	AI	Lab	Website. http:  ai.tencent.com ailab index.html  Role	in	China’s	National	AI	Team  	  As	a	part	of	China’s	national	AI	team,	Tencent’s	role	will	be	to	focus	on the	development	of	computer	vision	technology	to	help	improve	medical diagnostics.{288}  Along	with	the	three	leading	Chinese	companies	discussed	above,	there are	many	other	successful	startups	and	companies	in	China	that	are working	hard	to	develop	more	powerful	AI	technologies,	and	we	can	look forward	to	seeing	greater	results	from	them	over	time.   CHAPTER	IX   FREQUENTLY	ASKED	QUESTIONS	ABOUT  ARTIFICIAL	INTELLIGENCE	PART	I  	  Figure	9.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	IX.  	  During	the	lectures	and	seminars	I	have	presented	in	recent	months,	I have	been	inundated	with	attendees’	questions	and	doubts	about	artificial   intelligence	and	how	it	is	developing.  Some	of	the	questions	covered	in	this	chapter	are	more	generic	in nature,	such	as	what	kinds	of	AI	do	we	already	use	in	our	daily	lives	and how	can	we	best	apply	artificial	intelligence	in	business.	Others	address more	complex	issues	like	how	the	development	of	artificial	intelligence will	affect	our	privacy	and	why	it	is	crucial	to	have	clear	ethical	guidelines for	the	development	of	AI	products	and	services.  In	answering	these	questions,	I	try	to	provide	a	balance	between concrete	data	and	my	own	personal	opinions,	but	my	main	goal	is	to spark	your	interest	in	AI,	inspiring	you	to	want	to	learn	more	about	it	on your	own.  	   81.	What	Are	Some	AI	Resources	You	May	Already Be	Using?  There	are	plenty	of	ways	that	people	already	use	artificial	intelligence every	day	without	even	thinking	about	it	or	realizing	it.	Here	are	some	of the	most	common	examples:   	Smart	Virtual	Personal	Assistants:	Siri,	Cortana,	and	Google Assistant	are	prime	examples	of	widely	used	AI	tools,	and	are covered	extensively	in	other	areas	of	this	book.   	Personalized	Media	Recommendations:	Have	you	ever	used  Netflix	or	Spotify?	Each	of	these	companies	uses	AI	resources	to recommend	movies	or	music	based	on	your	previous	selections.  	Smart	Searches	on	Facebook:	Facebook’s	AI	tools	allow	you	to search	for	photos	by	content	using	image	recognition	programs. For	example,	you	can	search	for	images	related	to	“family”	or “pizza”	and	the	Facebook	AI	tools	will	find	them	for	you.{289}   	Product	Recommendations:	When	you	purchase	something through	Amazon.com,	its	machine	learning	algorithm	provides recommendations	for	similar	or	related	products	that	you	might	also be	interested	in	buying.   	Google	Searches:	For	many	years,	Google	search	results	have  been	a	direct	product	of	machine	learning,	personalizing	your results	based	on	your	location	and	past	searches.   	Speech	Recognition	in	Google	Search:	In	addition	to	text-based searches,	you	can	also	input	voice	commands,	which	Google	can interpret	using	AI	technology	known	as	speech	recognition.   	Facebook	Messenger	Bots:	Many	businesses	now	use	chatbots in	Facebook	Messenger	to	respond	to	everyday	customer	service requests.   	Online	Fraud	Protection:	PayPal,	the	online	payment	system,  uses	machine	learning	for	fraud	protection	by	analyzing	large   quantities	of	customer	data	to	help	evaluate	risk.	AI	is	a	key technology	for	all	online	financial	services,	since	they	are	frequent targets	of	cyber	criminals.{290}   	Online	Advertising:	Online	advertising	works	most	effectively when	enhanced	by	the	application	of	artificial	intelligence.	For example,	Facebook	advertising	uses	deep	learning	algorithms	to analyze	ad	performance	data	in	order	to	understand	how	best	to target	the	ads.	This	makes	it	much	likelier	that	the	ads	will	be viewed	by,	and	clicked	on	by,	the	intended	audience.  	  Figure	9.2.	Google	Voice	Search.  	  These	are	just	a	few	simple	examples	to	give	you	some	insight	into	the ways	that	AI	is	already	being	used	in	our	daily	lives,	but	there	are	many more	out	there.	In	the	future,	we’ll	probably	engage	in	the	use	of	even more	AI	tools	that	operate	behind-the-scenes,	often	going	unnoticed,	but providing	solutions	that	make	our	lives	easier	and	more	efficient.  	   82.	What	Are	Some	Common	Fears	Surrounding Artificial	Intelligence?  Based	on	my	conversations	with	others,	I	have	noticed	that	many	people have	at	least	some	degree	of	fear	when	it	comes	to	artificial	intelligence. In	most	cases,	this	stems	from	a	lack	of	understanding	about	what	AI	is or	an	overreliance	on	what	the	mainstream	media	says	about	these technologies.  Negative	news	captures	more	attention	than	positive	news,	which	is	why many	news	outlets	maximize	their	audiences	by	focusing	on	negative	or exaggerated	stories,	as	is	the	case	with	much	of	the	coverage surrounding	artificial	intelligence.  Almost	anything	that	is	new	and	complex	generates	confusion	and	fear among	humans.	Researchers	call	this	“negative	bias,”	which	refers	to	our collective	tendency	to	want	to	hear	and	remember	bad	news.{291}  Because	most	people	are	uneducated	about	artificial	intelligence,	the topic	has	become	a	target	for	negative	stories.	For	example,	in	the summer	of	2017,	many	news	outlets	ran	embellished	headlines	regarding Facebook’s	AI	experiments.	Consider	this	example	of	one	headline	run on	Yahoo	News:  “Facebook	engineers	panic,	pull	plug	on	AI	after	bots	develop	their	own language”  –	Yahoo	News  While	this	headline	certainly	captured	attention,	it	was	quite	a	departure from	the	truth,	as	the	event	did	not	cause	Facebook	engineers	to	panic. Instead,	the	media	altered	the	story	to	generate	more	traffic	and	gain more	attention.  An	article	by	Tom	McKay,	entitled	No,	Facebook	Did	Not	Panic	and	Shut Down	an	AI	Program	That	Was	Getting	Dangerously	Smart,	which	was published	on	the	website	Gizmodo,	explains	what	really	happened.	You can	read	the	article	here:   http:  gizmodo.com no-facebook-did-not-panic-and-shut-down-an-ai- program-1797414922  I’m	sure	we	will	continue	to	see	headlines	like	this	in	the	future,	as	AI applications	become	increasingly	more	common.	For	this	reason,	it’s always	a	good	idea	to	look	past	exaggerated	headlines,	follow	sources, and	do	your	own	independent	research.  One	of	the	most	common	fears	surrounding	the	development	of	artificial intelligence	is	that	eventually	we	will	create	some	type	of	super	artificial intelligence	that	will	harm	or	even	kill	the	humans.  One	source	of	this	fear	is	Hollywood’s	outrageous	depictions	of	AI,	which for	many	years	have	often	been	negative	or	scary,	repeatedly	showing terrifying	images	of	robots	destroying	their	creators.	Another	reason	is that	the	AI	technology	we	are	able	to	create	today	is	more	lifelike	than ever	before,	in	that	it	can	essentially	see,	hear,	understand,	reason,	and in	some	cases	walk,	talk,	and	even	look	human.	This	can	pave	the	way for	some	people’s	imaginations	to	run	wild	when	thinking	about	what these	machines	might	become	capable	of	doing.  Another	factor	possibly	fanning	the	flames	of	public	fear	could	be	that many	respected	scientists	and	AI	researchers	have	been	seen	on	the news	discussing	issues	that	could	be	legitimate	causes	for	concern. Some	of	these	famous	experts,	such	as	Stephen	Hawking	and	Elon Musk,	have	publicly	warned	that	the	development	of	AI	could	be dangerous	to	humans	if	we	don’t	prepare	and	plan	accordingly.	Sharing these	concerns	could	have	had	the	unintended	consequence	of exacerbating	the	public’s	fears	about	artificial	intelligence.  There	are	hundreds	of	experts	already	working	on	the	issue	of	public fear,	including	some	of	the	world’s	most	brilliant	minds	in	AI	and	other fields	of	science.	There	are	also	organizations,	like	the	Future	of	Life Institute,	implementing	a	lot	of	initiatives	in	this	regard.	I	strongly	believe that	they	are	all	doing	good	work	in	their	efforts	to	rid	the	general	public of	its	unfounded	fears.  The	figure	below	showcases	some	of	the	most	typical	fears	about advanced	AI.	The	content	of	this	image	is	originally	from	the	Future	of Life	Institute	and	is	a	great	representation	of	the	myths	and	truths   Life	Institute	and	is	a	great	representation	of	the	myths	and	truths regarding	advanced	AI.  	  Figure	9.3.7	Top	Myths	About	Advanced	AI by	Future	of	Life	Institute .  	  Throughout	this	book,	we’ve	covered	many	different	aspects	of	our	daily lives	that	will	be	positively	impacted	by	AI.	While	there	are	still	some issues	and	challenges	that	will	need	to	be	resolved,	leading	experts	are already	looking	for	solutions.	So	instead	of	worrying	about	hyped-up media	headlines,	start	thinking	about	how	you	can	apply	AI	in	your	own life,	both	now	and	in	the	near	future.   life,	both	now	and	in	the	near	future.  	   83.	What	Are	the	Key	Privacy	Concerns	About	AI Technologies?  One	of	the	many	challenges	facing	society	due	to	the	rapidly	increasing use	of	artificial	intelligence	is	how	to	maintain	privacy	of	information.  Can	you	remember	the	days	before	social	media	and	Google,	when	no one	could	search	for	you	by	name	online	and	obtain	information	about you?	From	that	time	until	now,	our	expectations	and	thoughts	about privacy	have	changed	immensely.	In	many	cases,	Google	and	Facebook know	more	about	our	daily	lives	and	decision-making	processes	than	we do,	just	by	the	sheer	amount	and	kinds	of	data	they	have	access	to.	This has	caused	many	people	to	become	concerned	about	their	loss	of privacy	to	large	tech	companies.  Over	the	next	few	years,	AI	will	become	prevalent	in	many	areas	of	our lives.	We	will	be	able	to	experience	incredible	improvements	in	health care,	education,	public	safety,	and	more,	all	thanks	to	artificial intelligence.	This	is	becoming	possible	because	of	the	ability	of	AI	tools	to work	quickly	and	accurately	to	collect	and	analyze	large	quantities	of data.  However,	with	so	much	data	being	available,	questions	arise	as	to	how we	can	ensure	that	our	private	information	is	not	used	inappropriately	or for	commercial	ends.	These	kinds	of	questions	need	to	be	addressed both	at	the	individual	level	and	in	the	political	realm,	where	legislation	can be	changed	or	introduced	to	protect	the	privacy	of	citizens.  Smart	digital	assistants	like	Apple’s	Siri,	Amazon’s	Alexa,	and	Google Assistant	can	be	extremely	useful	tools,	but	also	have	a	large	degree	of insight	into	the	places	we	go	and	the	things	we	do.	For	this	reason,	many people	are	already	hesitant	to	use	these	kinds	of	devices,	concerned	that the	companies	behind	them	could	use	or	sell	their	personal	information for	advertising	or	worse.  To	that	end,	many	have	argued	that	individuals	should	always	have access	to	the	data	the	technology	companies	have	about	them.	A	simple example	of	this	is	Google’s	My	Activity	service,	which	you	can	sign	in	to   from	your	Google	account	to	see	what	you	have	searched,	watched,	or visited	on	Google	sites.	You	can	use	this	service	here: https:  myactivity.google.com myactivity  The	concept	of	privacy	also	varies	from	country	to	country.	For	example, privacy	policies	in	the	U.S.	differ	greatly	from	those	in	Europe,	which	are often	more	strict	and	up-to-date	regarding	technology	trends.  One	such	piece	of	legislation	in	the	European	Union	is	called	the	General Data	Protection	Regulation	 GDPR ,	which	takes	effect	on	May	25th, 2018.	The	basic	premise	behind	this	set	of	laws	is	that	citizens	of	the	EU will	have	more	control	over	the	ways	in	which	their	personal	data	can	be used.  Here	are	three	interesting	highlights	from	this	legislation:   	The	Right	to	Be	Forgotten:	This	allows	every	EU	citizen	to  request	that	his	or	her	personal	data	be	deleted	from	the	records	of a	company.   	Informed	Consent:	Under	this	portion	of	the	law,	companies	will not	be	allowed	to	use	long	or	confusing	terms	and	conditions.	Any request	for	user	consent	must	be	easily	understandable	and accessible.	This	may	pose	a	big	challenge	for	some	of	the	services that	run	from	AI-powered	tools,	like	Alexa,	Google	Assistant	and Siri.   	Data	Portability:	Any	EU	citizen	can	also	ask	for	his	or	her	data	to  be	transmitted	over	to	another	provider.  You	can	examine	the	full	content	of	this	legislation	here: http:  www.eugdpr.org key-changes.html  	   Figure	9.4.	EU	GDPR	Website	at	eugdpr.org  	  It	will	likely	be	difficult	for	some	of	the	largest	companies	that	offer	AI tools	to	be	able	to	adapt	to	the	restrictions	imposed	by	this	set	of	laws. Gartner,	Inc.	estimates	that	50	percent	of	companies	will	not	be	able	to fully	comply	with	the	GDPR	by	the	end	of	2018.{292}  The	GDPR	represents	a	paradigm	shift	for	large	tech	companies	and	a step	forward	for	individuals’	rights	to	privacy.	As	tech	companies	in	the EU	are	forced	to	adapt	their	business	practices	to	comply	with	the	GDPR, hopefully	other	countries	will	begin	to	introduce	similar	kinds	of	legislation to	protect	their	citizens.  	   84.	Could	Technological	Advancements	Increase Loneliness,	Isolation,	and	Detached	Behaviors?  Over	the	years,	researchers	have	found	that	people	are	becoming	more attached	to	the	technological	devices	in	their	lives.	Think	back	…	can	you remember	the	last	time	you	spent	a	whole	day	without	your	smartphone? How	would	you	feel	if	you	had	to	give	up	your	phone	starting	tomorrow?  Thomas	Friedman,	a	best-selling	author	and	three-time	Pulitzer	Prize winner,	has	a	special	talent	for	analyzing	the	growth	of	technological developments	and	their	impacts	on	society.	In	his	latest	book,	Thank	You for	Being	Late,	he	reminds	us	that	it’s	vital	to	combine	technological development,	including	the	advancements	in	AI	and	other	exponential technologies,	“with	all	the	things	you	can’t	download—good	values,	good teaching,	good	educating,	things	that	take	time	and	are	slow”	and	that	if we	fail	to	do	so	we	are	in	trouble	as	a	society.{293}  Our	smartphones	give	us	instant	access	to	an	enormous	amount	of information,	help	us	to	communicate	more	effectively	and	solve	difficult problems,	but	constant	use	over	time	also	comes	with	a	price.  A	recent	report	indicates	that	spinal	surgeons	have	been	seeing	an increase	in	the	number	of	patients	with	neck	and	upper	back	pain,	which may	be	caused	by	the	posture	problems	that	often	result	from	extensive use	of	smartphones.{294}  Most	people	find	that	they	are	unable	to	detach	from	their	phones.	This	is just	one	example	of	the	kinds	of	long-term	challenges	that	are	associated with	the	use	of	new	technologies.  A	similar	situation	is	becoming	evident	with	the	rise	of	social	media. While	social	media	platforms	can	provide	us	with	networks	through	which we	can	communicate	and	share	information,	they	can	also	have	social drawbacks.	According	to	psychologists	in	the	UK,	for	example,	excessive use	of	social	media	is	directly	related	to	an	increased	feeling	of loneliness.{295}  In	fact,	some	people	already	spend	more	time	interacting	with	their computers	or	smartphone	screens	than	with	other	people.	For	others,   computers	or	smartphone	screens	than	with	other	people.	For	others, seeing	how	many	“likes”	their	picture	gets	on	Instagram	has	become more	important	than	having	social	interactions	in	real	life.	These	are	just some	of	the	examples	of	the	ways	that	technology	can	cause	problems when	not	used	in	moderation.  If	we	don’t	adhere	to	recommendations	for	moderate	use,	it’s	very	likely that	similar	problems	will	occur	with	AI	technologies.  For	example,	in	the	future,	smart	personal	assistants	like	Siri	and	Google Assistant	will	be	much	more	powerful,	capable	of	performing	just	about any	task,	even	communicating	with	our	friends.	If	we	depend	on	artificial intelligence	tools	to	do	everything	for	us,	this	overdependence	could threaten	some	of	the	very	qualities	that	make	us	human,	like	the	ability	to form	social	connections,	which	in	turn	could	have	negative	consequences for	us	as	individuals	and	as	a	society.  While	AI	offers	tremendous	potential	for	life-changing	applications,	it should	still	be	used	in	moderation.	More	than	anything	else,	AI	should	be used	to	create	solutions	by	which	people	can	embrace	that	which	makes them	uniquely	human.  	   85.	Is	There	Hype	Surrounding	Artificial	Intelligence?  Almost	anything	that	is	new	and	exciting	generates	some	degree	of	hype, and	the	same	is	true	for	artificial	intelligence.  By	the	most	common	definition,	hype	refers	to	the	exaggeration	of	the benefits	and	possibilities	of	something	and	is	normally	associated	with marketing	and	promotional	efforts.  The	figure	below	displays	the	Google	search	data	for	searches	of	the term	“artificial	intelligence.”  	  Figure	9.5.	Search	Results	for	Keywords	"Artificial	Intelligence"	 by  Google	Trends .  	  As	you	can	clearly	see,	searches	for	this	term	have	grown	significantly   As	you	can	clearly	see,	searches	for	this	term	have	grown	significantly over	time.	This	is	most	likely	because	of	the	expansion	of	AI	technologies into	different	industries	and	applications,	as	well	as	the	fact	that	these tools	are	gaining	more	attention	in	the	media.  Because	of	the	enormous	increase	in	Internet	searches	on	these keywords,	some	companies	promote	false	information	relating	to	AI	in order	to	gain	more	views	of	their	advertising.	Any	new	tech	startup	or product	can	easily	claim	to	be	“AI-powered,”	whether	it	is	true	or	not, simply	to	increase	the	number	of	people	who	might	see	or	click	on	its marketing	posts.  In	a	post	on	the	website	Quora,	Dr.	Zeeshan	Zia	makes	several	insightful observations	regarding	the	practice	of	hyping	AI	technologies.	For example,	according	to	Zia,	while	AI	is	typically	not	overhyped	in discussions	among	the	academic	research	community,	the	same	cannot be	said	about	many	AI-related	commercial	ventures.{296}  For	this	reason,	it	is	always	a	good	idea	to	check	the	sources	for	any claims	made	regarding	AI	tools	and	their	capabilities.  	   86.	What	Role	Should	Ethics	Play	in	Artificial Intelligence?  For	as	long	as	humans	have	inhabited	the	planet	Earth,	ethics	have	been used	to	help	us	define	what	is	right	or	wrong,	and	what	kinds	of	things should	be	permitted	or	banned.  In	a	way,	ethics	provide	society	with	the	framework	necessary	to	move together	and	coexist	with	a	common	set	of	accepted	rules.  In	the	field	of	artificial	intelligence,	one	of	the	most	ardent	proponents	of establishing	ethics	in	relation	to	emergent	technologies	is	Gerd Leonhard,	author	of	the	book	Technology	vs.	Humanity:	The	Coming Clash	Between	Man	and	Machine.	Leonhard	argues	that	everyone	is responsible	for	the	things	they	create,	saying,	“Many	of	the	companies are	cheap	on	the	ethical	side.	They	need	to	self-regulate.	They	need	to accept	responsibility.	And	if	they	don’t	do	that,	then	I	think	we	need	to	do it	for	them.”{297}  I	wholeheartedly	agree	with	this.	After	following	Leonhard’s	work,	I	have become	more	convinced	of	the	importance	of	ethics	in	the	world	of	AI and	believe	this	concept	should	be	taught	at	universities	and	other educational	institutions.	I	also	recommend	that	everyone	read	his	latest book	on	the	topic	to	learn	more	about	the	interaction	between	ethics	and technology.  Swedish	philosopher	Nick	Bostrom,	who	founded	the	Future	of	Life Institute	and	wrote	the	book	Superintelligence:	Paths,	Dangers, Strategies,	has	been	another	advocate	for	setting	ethical	guidelines around	the	development	of	AI	technologies.  Together	with	several	top	AI	experts,	the	Future	of	Life	Institute	has established	a	set	of	AI	principles	that	are	divided	into	three	sections: Research	Issues,	Ethics	and	Values,	and	Longer-term	Issues.  In	this	set	of	principles,	the	Ethics	and	Values	section	includes	the following:    	Safety:	AI	systems	should	be	safe	and	secure	throughout	their  operational	lifetime,	and	verifiably	so	where	applicable	and	feasible.   	Failure	Transparency:	If	an	AI	system	causes	harm,	it	should	be  possible	to	ascertain	why.   	Judicial	Transparency:	Any	involvement	by	an	autonomous  system	in	judicial	decision-making	should	provide	a	satisfactory explanation	auditable	by	a	competent	human	authority.   	Responsibility:	Designers	and	builders	of	advanced	AI	systems  are	stakeholders	in	the	moral	implications	of	their	use,	misuse,	and actions,	with	a	responsibility	and	opportunity	to	shape	those implications.   	Value	Alignment:	Highly	autonomous	AI	systems	should	be  designed	so	that	their	goals	and	behaviors	can	be	assured	to	align with	human	values	throughout	their	operation.   	Human	Values:	AI	systems	should	be	designed	and	operated	so as	to	be	compatible	with	ideals	of	human	dignity,	rights,	freedoms, and	cultural	diversity.   	Personal	Privacy:	People	should	have	the	right	to	access,	manage  and	control	the	data	they	generate,	given	AI	systems’	power	to analyze	and	utilize	that	data.   	Liberty	and	Privacy:	The	application	of	AI	to	personal	data	must  not	unreasonably	curtail	people’s	real	or	perceived	liberty.   	Shared	Benefit:	AI	technologies	should	benefit	and	empower	as  many	people	as	possible.   	Shared	Prosperity:	The	economic	prosperity	created	by	AI	should  be	shared	broadly,	to	benefit	all	of	humanity.   	Human	Control:	Humans	should	choose	how	and	whether	to  delegate	decisions	to	AI	systems,	to	accomplish	human-chosen objectives.    	Non-Subversion:	The	power	conferred	by	control	of	highly  advanced	AI	systems	should	respect	and	improve,	rather	than subvert,	the	social	and	civic	processes	on	which	the	health	of society	depends.   	AI	Arms	Race:	An	arms	race	in	lethal	autonomous	weapons	should  be	avoided.{298}  I	believe	that	these	guidelines	should	be	followed	in	the	development	of all	AI-related	projects,	as	well	as	taught	in	educational	institutions.

Image	Credit:	https:  youtu.be h0962biiZa4   	  To	learn	more	about	ethics	in	artificial	intelligence,	I	recommend	watching this	one-hour	video,	which	features	a	number	of	prominent	AI	experts, including	Elon	Musk,	Stuart	Russell,	Ray	Kurzweil,	Demis	Hassabis,	Sam Harris,	Nick	Bostrom,	David	Chalmers,	Bart	Selman	and	Jaan	Tallinn, sharing	their	opinions	on	the	growth	of	AI	and	how	we	can	prepare	to tackle	the	ethical	challenges	they	will	bring.	https:  youtu.be h0962biiZa4   	   87.	How	Can	You	Apply	Artificial	Intelligence	in Your	Daily	Life?  Did	you	know	that	there	are	ways	you	can	start	utilizing	artificial intelligence	tools	in	your	life	right	now,	even	if	you	don’t	work	for	a company	like	Google	or	Facebook?  It’s	a	good	idea	to	start	now	to	think	about	how	we	can	use	automation and	AI	tools	to	make	our	lives	more	efficient,	to	better	prepare	ourselves for	the	future.  You	can	start	by	imagining	the	ways	that	your	life	will	change	and	how the	everyday	tasks	you	perform	now	will	be	impacted	by	the	information you’ve	read	in	this	book.	Consider	some	of	the	things	that	caught	your interest	the	most	and	set	aside	time	to	delve	deeper	into	each	one.  Here	are	three	other	quick	things	that	you	can	do	today	to	become	more familiar	and	comfortable	with	AI	tools:   	Use	Voice	Commands	on	Your	Smartphone:	Rather	than	typing in	your	requests	to	Siri	or	Google	Assistant,	use	voice	commands to	do	simple	tasks	like	setting	an	alarm	or	adding	an	event	to	your calendar.	You	can	also	use	voice	commands	through	Microsoft Cortana	on	computers	and	can	even	search	Google	with	simple verbal	requests.	Becoming	familiar	with	tools	like	this	will	help	you to	be	ready	as	these	personal	assistants	become	more	powerful and	adept	at	completing	complex	tasks.   	List	the	Things	You’d	Like	to	Automate:	Even	grocery	shopping  can	be	done	through	an	app	and	delivered	to	your	door	in	some areas.	I	personally	began	to	do	this	a	few	months	back	and	found that	it	really	helps	to	save	time	in	my	day.   	Experiment	with	Bots:	Search	for	various	chatbots	and	begin  testing	them	to	see	what	they	can	help	you	with.	The	directory	at https:  botlist.co 	is	a	great	place	to	start.  For	businesses,	one	of	my	favorite	bots	is	GrowthBot,	which	offers	a wealth	of	interesting	information	about	sales	and	marketing.	This	tool	was   wealth	of	interesting	information	about	sales	and	marketing.	This	tool	was created	by	HubSpot	and	works	on	Facebook	Messenger	and	the	team collaboration	tool	Slack.  Figure	9.7.	Botlist	Website	at	botlist.co  	  These	are	just	a	few	examples	of	ways	that	you	can	begin	to	automate your	life	by	using	AI	technologies.	If	you	want	to	delve	deeper	into	other topics	related	to	artificial	intelligence,	you	can	review	the	recommended resources	sections	found	at	the	end	of	the	chapters	on	self-driving	cars and	robotics.  	  	   88.	How	Can	You	Apply	Artificial	Intelligence	at Your	Business?  Many	of	the	largest	technology	companies	have	placed	a	high	priority	on implementing	artificial	intelligence	tools	throughout	their	organizations.  Whether	you	run	a	large	corporation	or	work	for	a	small	company,	it’s	a good	idea	to	do	the	same,	as	those	who	are	the	first	to	implement	and adapt	to	these	technologies	will	reap	the	greatest	rewards.  Take	a	moment	to	review	the	chapter	on	how	AI	is	changing	business processes,	and	identify	which	two	out	of	the	ten	processes	listed	are most	relevant	to	your	business.	What	steps	can	you	take	toward	applying AI	tools	to	them	now?  For	most	companies,	the	easiest	way	to	start	is	by	creating	a	simple chatbot	for	Facebook	Messenger	that	can	start	handling	simple	customer service	queries	and	can	be	developed	later	to	deal	with	more	complex tasks.  Don’t	stop	there,	however.	Actively	look	for	ways	that	you	can	apply	AI solutions	within	your	company.	Research	the	ways	that	your	competitors and	others	in	similar	sectors	are	leveraging	these	tools.	Then	use	the results	of	your	research	as	inspiration	for	ideas	about	how	you	can	make the	best	use	of	AI	tools	to	benefit	your	own	business.  You	can	also	get	in	touch	with	some	of	the	largest	providers	of	AI	tools, like	IBM’s	Watson	team,	to	see	if	they	offer	suitable	AI	solutions	for	your industry.	You	can	learn	more	about	the	IBM	Watson	team	at: www.ibm.com watson  Economists	Erik	Brynjolfsson	and	Andrew	Mcafee	argue	that	for businesses	seeking	to	apply	AI	tools,	the	biggest	bottlenecks	occur	in management,	implementation,	and	imagination.	For	some	companies,	it is	difficult	for	leaders	to	imagine	all	the	things	that	AI	can	help	them	to	do, like	creating	more	innovative	products	and	services,	or	improving	their workflow.{299}  With	this	in	mind,	as	we	continue	making	our	way	into	the	future,	one	of   With	this	in	mind,	as	we	continue	making	our	way	into	the	future,	one	of the	most	valuable	skills	for	business	owners	will	probably	be	imagination, something	that	is	good	for	each	of	us	to	try	to	apply	to	our	companies regularly.  	   89.	What	is	the	Impact	of	Artificial	Intelligence	on Other	Exponential	Technologies?  There	is	a	wide	variety	of	exponential	technologies	being	used	today	to improve	the	ways	we	live	and	work.	Some	of	the	most	prominent examples	of	exponential	technologies	include	the	IoT	 Internet	of	Things , blockchain,	nanotechnology,	augmented	and	virtual	reality,	3D	printing, and	quantum	computing.  Each	of	the	technologies	listed	above	are	worth	following.	When	paired with	artificial	intelligence,	it	is	astonishing	just	how	powerful	they	can	be.  Internet	of	Things   	Definition:	According	to	Wikipedia,	the	IoT	is	essentially	defined	as  connections	between	devices	through	the	Internet,	whether	they come	from	vehicles,	buildings	or	elsewhere,	that	include	sensors, software	and	networking	capabilities,	that	provide	ways	for	data	to be	collected	and	exchanged.{300}   	AI	Applications:	In	the	future,	everything	will	be	connected	to	the  Internet,	and	the	IoT	will	provide	a	global	infrastructure.	The quantity	of	data	from	the	multitude	of	devices	connected	to	the	IoT will	be	extremely	large,	making	it	a	perfect	fit	for	artificial intelligence	tools.  For	example,	the	IoT	can	be	used	to	help	self-driving	cars	operate more	safely	and	to	enable	cities	to	use	data	for	predicting	crime trends.  According	to	the	Global	Big	Data	Conference,	there	are	three	core elements	in	which	AI	can	help	the	IoT.	These	are:  ○	Analysis	of	Imaging	Data:	AI	can	help	computers	to	interpret  images	on	a	screen	by	offering	contextual	information.  ○	Personalization:	Cognitive	systems	can	assist	in	creating	a  highly	individualized	user	experience.	For	example,	AI	can	use data	to	create	new	recipes	to	match	the	tastes	and	preferences   of	a	particular	individual,	suggest	ingredient	adaptations	based on	that	person’s	locale,	and	recommend	customized	menus.  ○	Increased	Sensory	Capabilities:	New	kinds	of	sensors	will  allow	computers	to	replicate	the	experience	of	hearing	by collecting	sonic	information	from	the	user’s	surroundings.{301}  3D	Printing   	Definition:	3D	printing	is	defined	as	the	creation	of	solid,	three- dimensional	objects	from	a	digital	file.	3D	printers	are	becoming more	common	and	are	even	available	to	be	purchased	in	stores today.	The	capabilities	of	3D	printing	technology	are	currently limited	mostly	to	smaller	objects.	However,	in	the	future,	we	will likely	be	able	to	use	3D	printing	technologies	to	manufacture	larger items	such	as	clothing,	and	perhaps	someday	even	houses	or certain	types	of	food.{302}   	AI	Applications:	Traditionally,	most	3D	printers	have	been  operated	by	humans.	However,	there	are	currently	a	number	of projects	being	developed	that	will	use	AI-powered	robots	to	run	3D printers,	offering	more	efficient	production	capabilities.  One	London-based	company	called	Ai	Build	is	currently	using	3D printers	with	robot	arms	and	computer	vision	to	build	large-scale objects	at	a	remarkably	fast	speed.{303}  In	the	figure	below,	you	can	see	an	object	measuring	5	meters  about	16	feet 	tall	that	was	created	by	a	3D	printer	with	a	robotic arm	and	computer	vision.	This	is	a	perfect	example	of	what	can	be accomplished	by	combining	the	applications	of	AI	with	3D	printing.  	   Figure	9.8.	Structure	Constructed	with	Robot-Armed	3D	Printer	Using	AI-  Powered	Computer	Vision.	Source:	http:  3dp.ai-build.com  Blockchain  	   	Definition:	Blockchain	is	basically	a	distributed	ledger	that  maintains	a	permanent	record	of	data	transactions.  The	most	common	application	of	blockchain	today	can	be	seen	in digital	currency	like	Bitcoin.	However,	this	technology	will	be expanded	to	a	number	of	additional	applications	in	the	future.	For example,	in	Estonia,	blockchain	has	been	used	to	authenticate electronic	voting,	allowing	citizens	to	vote	online	while	reducing	the risk	of	voter	fraud.   Blockchain	will	also	be	used	in	other	important	fields	like	law, health	care,	and	digital	identity	verification.	Some	experts	have already	begun	to	refer	to	blockchain-enabled	Internet	as	“Web 3.0.”{304}   	AI	Applications:	As	more	businesses	begin	to	embrace	the  possibilities	afforded	by	blockchain,	we	will	likely	see	a	greater number	of	blockchain	partnerships	with	AI	technologies.  One	example	of	AI	being	used	with	blockchain	comes	from	a	U.S.- based	startup	known	as	doc.AI,	which	brings	these	technologies together	to	offer	a	better	and	more	personalized	health	care experience.  According	to	blockchaintechnology-news.com,	the	service	works as	follows:  “Blockchain	is	used	to	time-stamp	and	store	datasets,	while	the sophisticated	AI	uses	the	data	to	answer	patient	queries	about	their care.”{305}  As	exponential	technologies	and	AI	continue	to	grow	and	become more	powerful,	we	will	likely	see	more	examples	of	partnerships between	these	extraordinary	tools.  	   90.	When	Will	Artificial	Intelligence	Be	Able	to Perform	Tasks	Better	Than	Humans?  Even	with	all	the	information	that	exists	in	regard	to	the	growth	of	AI technologies,	it	is	still	quite	challenging	to	predict	how	it	will	develop	in the	future.  Throughout	this	book,	we	have	discussed	a	number	of	amazing	AI advancements	that	are	being	implemented	right	now	or	within	the	next few	years.	However,	one	question	that	is	often	asked	among	researchers is	whether	there	will	come	a	time	when	AI	technologies	are	able	to perform	ALL	tasks	better	than	humans,	and	if	so,	when	that	might	be.  The	most	all-encompassing	study	of	AI	advancements	done	to	date	was conducted	by	the	Future	of	Humanity	Institute	at	Oxford	University.	The results	of	this	study,	in	which	352	artificial	intelligence	researchers	were interviewed,	are	explained	in	a	report	called	When	Will	AI	Exceed	Human Performance?	Evidence	from	AI	Experts.	You	can	read	the	report	in	its entirety	here:	https:  arxiv.org pdf 1705.08807.pdf  Here	is	a	brief	summary	of	some	of	the	study’s	most	interesting	findings:  Artificial	intelligence	will	likely	progress	according	to	the	estimated timeline	below,	becoming	able	to	outperform	humans	at	the	following tasks	by	the	corresponding	years:   	Translating	languages:	2024  	Writing	high	school	essays:	2026  	Driving	trucks:	2027  	Working	in	retail:	2031  	Writing	best-selling	books:	2049  	Performing	surgeries:	2053  The	study	also	found	that	there	is	up	to	a	50	percent	chance	of	artificial intelligence	tools	outperforming	humans	in	all	tasks	within	45	years	and of	automating	all	human	jobs	within	120	years.{306}   If	this	is	your	first	time	learning	about	such	predictions,	it	may	be	a	little bit	shocking.	It’s	easy	to	let	your	imagination	run	wild,	thinking	that	AI	will take	over	the	world	or	that	there	will	be	nothing	left	for	people	to	do	in light	of	such	advanced	technologies.  However,	it	is	my	firm	conviction	that	AI	will	primarily	perform	the repetitive	tasks,	affording	us	more	time	to	focus	on	the	creative	and innovative	work	humans	do	best,	and	to	participate	in	the	fun	and interesting	activities	we	enjoy	most.  Finally,	most	of	the	researchers	interviewed	in	the	study	believed	that	as AI	begins	to	outperform	humans	in	basic	tasks,	it	will	most	likely	have	a positive	impact	on	humanity	overall.{307}  To	learn	more	about	this	topic	I	highly	recommend	the	book	by	Max Tegmark	called	Life	3.0:	Being	Human	in	the	Age	of	Artificial	Intelligence, which	gives	an	insightful	view	about	artificial	intelligence	in	the	future.   CHAPTER	X   FREQUENTLY	ASKED	QUESTIONS	ABOUT  ARTIFICIAL	INTELLIGENCE	PART	II  	  Figure	10.1.	Topics	in	Chapter	X.  	  In	this	chapter	I	will	answer	some	additional	commonly	asked	questions about	artificial	intelligence.	Included	will	be	discussions	about	some	of   the	extraordinary	benefits	that	AI	could	help	bring	to	the	world,	such	as putting	an	end	to	poverty	and	maybe	even	someday	achieving	world peace.	Conversely,	I	will	also	address	some	very	serious	challenges	we could	be	faced	with,	such	as	the	weaponization	of	artificial	intelligence and	the	abuse	of	AI	for	the	purposes	of	political	propaganda.  Also,	there	is	an	interesting	analysis	on	which	countries	are	likely	to	lead the	AI	development	race	in	the	future,	as	well	as	an	examination	of whether	countries	should	establish	governmental	ministries	of	artificial intelligence.  I	hope	you	find	these	topics	interesting,	and	that	you	will	start	following them	in	more	detail	as	they	continue	to	develop	and	evolve,	as	these issues	are	vitally	important	for	our	future.  	   91.	Could	Artificial	Intelligence	Help	Us	to	Achieve World	Peace?  Of	all	the	applications	for	which	artificial	intelligence	technologies	could be	used,	perhaps	one	of	the	most	complicated	and	important	is	that	of achieving	world	peace.  For	the	past	30	years,	Finnish	professor	Timo	Honkela	has	been researching	artificial	intelligence	and	machine	learning,	with	a	focus	on the	ways	in	which	AI	could	serve	humanity	and	help	us	to	achieve	a	more peaceful	world.  Specifically,	he	has	been	working	on	creating	an	AI-based	“peace machine”	that	would	be	used	to	bring	harmony	and	understanding	in	the midst	of	international	conflicts.  Recently,	Honkela	was	quoted	as	saying:  “Machines	and	artificial	intelligence	can’t	substitute	[for]	human	beings, but	they	can	provide	knowledge,	possibilities,	and	support	for	peace processes.	Those	processes	are	often	about	understanding	the language,	culture,	and	marginalization.”{308}  Honkela	highlights	that	a	true	understanding	of	language	and	culture	is based	on	two	questions:  1.	How	Can	We	Understand	Others	Better?	Even	when	we	speak the	same	language,	a	single	word	can	have	different	meanings	or connotations	in	a	conversation	between	two	people.	For	example, think	of	what	a	word	like	“justice”	or	“fairness”	means	to	you.	What preconceptions	do	you	bring	to	language,	based	on	your experiences?{309}  AI	can	help	us	to	overcome	obstacles	in	communication	by	offering recommendations	or	hints	when	we	say	something	that	could potentially	be	understood	in	multiple	ways.  2.	How	Can	We	Resolve	Conflicts	That	Are	Highly	Emotional?	In  many	cases,	our	past	emotional	experiences	can	influence	the   way	we	might	respond	to	a	certain	situation.	Oftentimes,	we	are completely	unaware	of	the	emotional	baggage	we	bring	to	our conversations	and	relationships,	making	it	difficult	for	us	to recognize	when	we	are	not	communicating	appropriately.{310}  In	these	cases,	AI	tools	could	offer	recommendations	on	ways	to recognize	and	deal	with	our	emotions,	allowing	us	to	respond	more effectively.  	  Figure	10.2.	Timo	Honkela's	Book	Entitled	Rauhankone,	Peace	Machine  in	English.  	  Although	Honkela	realizes	there	can	never	be	a	perfect	AI-powered	tool capable	of	magically	resolving	all	human	conflicts,	he	is	still	hopeful	that his	work	toward	the	creation	of	a	“peace	machine”	will	be	a	step	in	the right	direction.   	   92.	What	Is	the	General	Public’s	Opinion	About Artificial	Intelligence?  Recently,	I	have	heard	all	kinds	of	comments	from	the	general	public	in connection	with	artificial	intelligence.	Some	people	are	truly	afraid,	thanks to	scary	images	portrayed	by	Hollywood.	Others	are	excited	to experience	the	advances	available	in	health	care	through	AI technologies.	Still	others	are	uninterested	and	don’t	seem	to	understand how	quickly	and	profoundly	AI	will	impact	their	lives.  For	the	most	part,	the	general	public	is	unaware	of	the	progress	in artificial	intelligence	and	corresponding	technologies,	especially	when	it comes	to	the	ways	in	which	these	tools	will	change	society.	That	is	one reason	why	I	felt	compelled	to	write	this	book.  One	recent	study	conducted	in	the	UK	by	the	Royal	Society	sought	to learn	about	public	perceptions	in	regard	to	machine	learning.	Of	those asked,	most	respondents	were	at	least	aware	of	the	term.{311}  The	study	found	that	the	general	public’s	greatest	fear	in	relation	to machine	learning	is	having	these	tools	in	their	homes	and	cars.	Since these	are	places	where	most	people	currently	feel	a	high	degree	of privacy,	it	is	easy	to	understand	where	this	apprehension	stems	from.  With	advanced	AI	technologies	becoming	increasingly	present	in	homes and	cars,	people	are	starting	to	ask	questions	about	what	would	happen if	hackers	gained	access	to	these	systems,	or	if	governments	were	able to	monitor	their	private	conversations.	These	kinds	of	fears	will	most likely	cause	some	individuals	to	be	resistant	to	adding	AI-based applications	to	their	homes	and	cars	when	they	are	first	released.  The	study	also	discovered	that	most	of	the	general	public	perceives	the health	care	industry	as	having	the	greatest	potential	for	positive	change as	a	result	of	advancements	in	AI	technology.  Vanity	Fair	magazine	collaborated	with	the	CBS	television	program	60 Minutes	to	take	a	poll	on	this	topic	as	well.	The	results	showed	that	two-   thirds	of	those	surveyed	believe	that	human	intelligence	poses	a	greater threat	to	humanity	than	artificial	intelligence.  Participants	in	this	poll	were	also	asked	which	decisions	they	were	most likely	to	delegate	to	computers	first.	Of	those	asked,	33	percent responded	that	retirement	planning	decisions	would	be	the	first	they would	feel	comfortable	enough	to	assign	to	a	computer.{312}  The	Royal	Society's	report	highlighted	the	importance	of	creating	an environment	of	“careful	stewardship”	to	help	ensure	that	the	benefits	of all	these	new	AI	technologies	will	be	experienced	broadly	in	society.	As	a whole,	I	believe	that	this	is	a	sound	initiative	that	should	be	promoted publicly.{313}  	   93.	Should	Countries	Have	an	Artificial	Intelligence Minister?  Traditionally,	countries	have	assigned	ministers	or	secretaries	to	oversee various	sectors	or	industries,	such	as	agriculture,	education,	or commerce.  In	the	near	future,	governments	will	also	need	to	consider	the	possibility of	establishing	a	position	such	as	a	“secretary	of	technology,”	who	would be	responsible	for	handling	the	important	issues	and	challenges	related to	artificial	intelligence	and	robotics.  In	fact,	some	of	the	most	fundamental	questions	that	countries	will	need to	answer	include	how	to	ensure	that	AI	is	used	ethically,	and	how	to guarantee	that	its	benefits	will	be	spread	across	all	layers	of	society, rather	than	simply	being	used	within	technological	companies	or	only enjoyed	by	the	wealthy.  In	October	of	2017,	the	United	Arab	Emirates	became	the	first	country	in the	world	to	create	a	position	for	an	artificial	intelligence	minister, appointing	Omar	Bin	Sultan	Al	Olama	as	the	Minister	of	State	for	Artificial Intelligence.{314}	Taking	this	important	step	clearly	demonstrates	that	the UAE	is	being	proactive	in	preparing	for	the	future	of	AI,	and	doing	so	will hopefully	serve	as	an	example	for	other	governments	to	do	the	same.  In	February	of	2017,	Denmark	became	the	first	country	to	designate	a technology	ambassador,	who	is	based	in	Silicon	Valley.	Leading	the	way in	this	regard	shows	that	the	country	is	taking	initiative	in	planning realistically	for	the	future.  Denmark’s	Foreign	Minister,	Anders	Samuelsen,	commented	on	the need	for	the	role,	saying:  “The	tech	ambassador	will	spearhead	our	efforts	to	establish	a	more comprehensive	dialogue	with	a	broad	range	of	tech	actors	–	companies, research	institutions,	countries,	cities,	authorities	and	organizations.”{315}  Hopefully,	other	countries	will	follow	the	example	set	by	the	United	Arab Emirates	and	Denmark	in	creating	a	specialized	leadership	role	in   Emirates	and	Denmark	in	creating	a	specialized	leadership	role	in technology	within	the	government.	This	will	help	other	leaders	to	keep	up with	the	latest	technological	advances,	while	also	taking	on	key	issues like	privacy,	ethical	use,	and	public	benefits.  	   94.	Can	Artificial	Intelligence	Help	to	End	Poverty?  Usually,	when	we	read	about	the	benefits	of	AI	in	the	news,	it	pertains	to the	ways	that	businesses	can	be	improved	or	become	more	efficient. However,	AI	may	actually	be	suitable	to	take	on	even	greater,	worldwide challenges,	such	as	poverty.  One	way	that	AI	can	be	used	to	fight	poverty	comes	from	a	combination of	satellite	imagery	and	machine	learning	technologies.	A	team	of researchers	based	out	of	Stanford	University	is	currently	using	these tools	to	identify	which	areas	have	the	highest	concentrations	of	poverty and	what	kinds	of	help	they	might	need	in	Sub-Saharan	Africa.  One	indicator	of	poverty	that	can	be	observed	through	these	tools	is	low night	light	intensity.	Large	cities	often	have	abundant	light	sources,	even at	night.	In	contrast	poorer,	more	rural	areas	are	likely	to	have	lower	light intensity,	even	during	evening	hours.	These	artificial	intelligence	systems can	also	compare	images	of	lighting	quality	at	night	against	those	taken in	daytime	to	separate	out	roads,	farmland	and	other	areas,	to	further pinpoint	the	locations	with	the	highest	concentrations	of	poverty.  The	basic	objective	of	this	research	is	to	create	detailed	maps	of	where poverty	might	be	the	most	severe,	which	can	then	be	shared	publically	to begin	to	raise	awareness	and	aid	for	those	areas.{316}  According	to	World	Bank,	an	organization	that	seeks	to	end	extreme poverty	by	2030,	“extreme	poverty”	is	characterized	as	having	$1.90	or less	per	day	to	live	on.{317}  The	research	described	above	is	just	one	example	of	the	kinds	of projects	that	are	being	worked	on	right	now,	using	AI	tools	to	assist	those around	the	world	who	need	help	the	most,	and	to	try	to	put	an	end	to poverty.  	   95.	Can	Artificial	Intelligence	Help	in	Remote	Places Like	Sub-Saharan	Africa?  The	next	few	years	will	be	very	exciting	times,	as	startup	hubs	will continue	to	expand	across	the	US,	China	and	Europe,	where entrepreneurs	are	developing	astonishing	AI	applications	and	solutions.  Although	many	of	these	advancements	will	most	directly	affect	First World	countries,	there	are	also	plenty	of	applications	for	less	developed nations,	like	those	of	Sub-Saharan	Africa.  In	the	chapter	about	how	AI	is	changing	various	industries,	we	discuss the	ways	in	which	agriculture	will	be	transformed	due	to	the	capabilities	of AI	tools.	These	tools	can	also	help	to	provide	relief	to	some	of	the	poorer, more	remote	locales	around	the	world.  AI-powered	drones	will	also	provide	solutions	not	only	for	monitoring crops,	but	also	for	problems	like	poaching.	Traditionally,	it	has	been difficult	to	identify	where	poachers	were	operating	from,	but	drones	will help	to	make	this	much	easier.{318}  There	are	also	some	new	AI	ventures	intended	to	help	people	in	remote locations.	One	example	is	a	chatbot	called	Kudi	AI,	which	allows	people to	use	messaging	to	send	money	to	friends	in	faraway	places	like Nigeria.	It	can	also	help	users	to	keep	track	of	their	own	spending	habits and	protect	them	from	fraud.  	   Figure	10.3.	Kudi	AI	Home	Page	at	kudi.ai  	  Another	example	is	an	AI	app	developed	by	a	Nigerian	startup	called Aajoh.	This	tool	allows	patients	without	direct	access	to	quality	medical care	to	input	their	symptoms	through	text,	audio	or	photographs,	and then	receive	a	medical	diagnosis	based	on	the	information	provided.{319}  These	are	just	a	few	examples	of	the	ways	that	AI	technologies	can provide	positive	solutions	for	global	problems	including	poverty,	hunger, and	lack	of	medical	care,	even	in	the	most	remote	locations.  	   96.	Which	Countries	Are	Currently	Winning	the	Race for	AI	Leadership?  Currently,	the	countries	with	the	greatest	number	of	AI	startups	and	the most	advanced	AI	research	are	the	United	States	and	China.  For	a	long	time,	the	U.S.	has	led	the	way	in	artificial	intelligence,	offering some	of	the	most	commonly	used	AI	tools,	as	it	is	home	to	companies like	Google,	Facebook,	Amazon,	and	other	tech	giants	that	create, develop,	and	apply	AI	resources.  However,	China	is	currently	making	great	efforts	to	take	America’s	place as	world	leader	in	AI	technologies,	and	has	already	begun	to	achieve success	in	the	commercialization	of	facial	recognition	tools	and	other	AI resources.{320}	{321}	  	  Figure	10.4.	U.S.	and	China.  	  According	to	the	Chinese	government,	by	the	year	2025	the	country’s	AI industry	should	be	generating	more	than	$59	billion	in	output	annually. Also,	the	country	aspires	to	be	the	number	one	leader	in	AI	technologies by	2030.   Considering	the	amount	of	effort	being	put	into	AI	developments	by	both the	public	and	private	sectors,	it’s	highly	likely	that	China	will	be	the	world AI	leader	in	2030	or	even	sooner.	Furthermore,	while	China	has	been putting	increasingly	more	of	its	resources	into	AI,	the	U.S.	has	been cutting	back	on	science	funding,	giving	China	an	even	better	opportunity to	achieve	its	goals.{322}  One	report,	by	Accenture	PLC	and	Frontier	Economics,	estimates	that	AI tools	have	the	potential	to	increase	China’s	annual	growth	rate	by	1.6 percentage	points	by	the	year	2035	in	terms	of	gross	value	added.{323}  Malcolm	Frank,	co-author	of	the	book	What	to	Do	When	Machines	Do Everything,	posits	that	India	is	another	country	that	will	take	a	leadership role	in	the	artificial	intelligence	revolution,	as	it	hosts	numerous	large	tech companies	and	offers	a	dynamic	environment	for	startups.{324}  	   97.	Which	Other	Countries	Are	Striving	to	Be	AI Leaders?  In	addition	to	the	U.S.	and	China,	which	are	leading	the	world	in	AI development	and	implementation,	there	are	a	number	of	other	countries that	have	begun	to	invest	heavily	in	AI	tools.  Canada	has	introduced	several	innovative	initiatives	that	will	allow	AI	to be	used	more	effectively	in	the	country.	It	has	also	welcomed	an	influx	of talent	in	the	fields	of	machine	learning	and	artificial	intelligence.  One	reason	behind	the	migration	of	technology	leaders	to	Canada	is	the Vector	Institute,	an	organization	that	seeks	to	delve	deeply	into	AI applications	and	produce	more	deep	learning	graduates	than	any	other institution	in	the	world.{325}  More	information	on	the	Vector	Institute	can	be	found	at	their	website, http:  vectorinstitute.ai  	  Figure	10.5.Vector	Institute	Website	at	vectorinstitute.ai   	  Alphabet’s	DeepMind,	formerly	run	by	Google,	opened	its	first international	research	lab	in	Edmonton,	Canada,	where	the	field	of	deep learning	was	first	created	by	Canadian	academics	Geoffrey	Hinton	and Yoshua	Bengio.{326}	Facebook	has	also	announced	that	it	will	open	an	AI lab	in	Montreal,	Canada	that	will	initially	employ	10	artificial	intelligence researchers.	In	short,	Canada	has	all	of	the	elements	necessary	to become	an	AI	super	power.{327}  In	the	education	and	high	technology	fields,	Finland	is	also	becoming	a leader	in	AI.	Prime	Minister	Juha	Sipilä	has	already	spoken	about	his desire	for	the	country	to	lead	the	world	in	these	technologies.{328}	As	a small,	digitalized,	and	innovative	country	with	a	vibrant	environment	for startups,	Finland	has	great	potential	for	global	AI	leadership.	Finland	has also	been	selected	by	IBM,	a	world	leader	in	AI,	to	use	Watson,	IBM’s famous	AI	tool,	to	develop	personalized	health	care	and	spark	economic growth.{329}  Many	other	countries	are	mimicking	the	examples	of	these	leading countries	in	the	world	of	artificial	intelligence.	As	governments	and organizations	become	more	interested	in	the	applications	of	AI,	additional countries	will	likely	follow	suit.  	   98.	Is	Artificial	Intelligence	Used	for	Political Propaganda?  In	the	past,	the	spread	of	information	prior	to	an	important	election	was done	largely	through	flyers	and	posters.	Today,	this	type	of	information	is primarily	disseminated	in	digital	form,	using	advanced	technologies	to impact	voters’	opinions	on	a	more	personal	level.  With	the	enormous	amount	of	data	available	on	services	like	Facebook, it’s	possible	to	identify	the	genders,	ages	and	ethnic	backgrounds	of individual	voters,	as	well	as	their	hobbies	and	even	some	of	their emotional	experiences.	This	type	of	information	can	be	used	by	political candidates	as	the	basis	upon	which	to	create	personalized	campaign messages.  One	UK-based	company	called	Cambridge	Analytica	has	been	accused by	some	of	using	AI	technology	to	unfairly	influence	the	outcome	of	the 2016	U.S.	presidential	election.	On	its	website,	the	company	states	that	it “uses	data	to	change	audience	behavior.”{330}  The	company	also	claims	to	have	over	5,000	data	points	on	more	than 230	million	American	voters.{331}  According	to	the	website	scout.ai,	Cambridge	Analytica	is	“leveraging automated	emotional	manipulation	alongside	swarms	of	bots,	Facebook dark	posts,	A B	testing,	and	fake	news	networks,	and	these	make	up	a nearly	impenetrable	voter	manipulation	machine.”  Cambridge	Analytica’s	services	have	also	reportedly	been	used	in	the pro-Brexit	campaign	in	the	United	Kingdom.	According	to	Wikipedia,	the company	is	currently	subject	to	ongoing	criminal	investigations	in	both the	U.S.	and	the	UK.{332}  The	alleged	misconduct	of	this	company	is	just	one	example	of	how	large quantities	of	data,	data	science,	and	artificial	intelligence	are	being	used to	influence	political	elections.	It	is	often	difficult	to	detect	the	use	of	these kinds	of	programs	and	services	in	the	political	arena.	Clearly,	however, these	practices	raise	some	ethical,	moral	and	legal	concerns.	Therefore rules	and	laws	pertaining	to	these	issues	will	need	to	be	put	in	place	as   rules	and	laws	pertaining	to	these	issues	will	need	to	be	put	in	place	as these	technologies	continue	to	grow.  	   99.	Will	Artificial	Intelligence	Create	Geopolitical Inequality	or	Imbalance?  One	of	the	greatest	challenges	our	society	is	faced	with	due	to	the	growth of	artificial	intelligence	technologies	is	the	replacement	of	human	workers with	automation	and	robotic	tools,	as	we	have	explored	in	other	chapters of	this	book.  However,	as	the	issues	surrounding	AI	are	discussed,	one	topic	that	is not	often	addressed	is	the	potential	for	these	technologies	to	bring imbalance	between	countries.  The	development	of	AI	technologies	is	happening	at	a	staggering	pace. Most	of	that	large-scale	development,	however,	is	concentrated	in	the United	States	and	China,	where	the	eight	largest	AI	companies	 Google, Amazon,	Facebook,	Microsoft,	IBM,	Baidu,	Tencent	and	Alibaba 	have their	home	offices.  Dr.	Kai-Fu	Lee,	president	of	the	Artificial	Intelligence	Institution	and chairman	of	Sinovation	Ventures,	discusses	this	challenge	in	a	column	in the	New	York	Times	called	The	Real	Threat	of	Artificial	Intelligence.	Dr. Lee	argues	that	because	every	nation	will	need	artificial	intelligence	tools to	stay	competitive	politically	and	economically,	smaller	or	poorer countries	may	be	forced	to	negotiate	deals	with	the	U.S.	and	China	to obtain	the	software	they	need.{333}  He	also	points	out	that	many	countries’	governments	may	need	to provide	some	form	of	universal	basic	income	or	subsidies	to	assist	those who	have	lost	their	jobs	to	automation,	while	also	dealing	with	the	loss	of income	tax	funds	from	those	same	people.  Dr.	Lee’s	observations	are	insightful	and	should	serve	as	an encouragement	for	the	technology	companies	and	governments	to	work together,	as	large	tech	companies	don’t	always	recognize	the	impact their	tools	will	bring	on	a	societal	or	global	scale.{334}  One	potential	solution	to	the	global	disparities	in	availability	of	AI	tools would	be	to	offer	more	“open	source”	AI	software,	research	and	data, meaning	accessible	to	anyone	around	the	world,	which	would	encourage   meaning	accessible	to	anyone	around	the	world,	which	would	encourage more	sustainable	and	equitable	development.  	   100.	Can	Artificial	Intelligence	Be	Weaponized?  Unfortunately,	the	answer	to	this	question	is	“yes.”  Consider	some	of	the	tools	used	throughout	history.	In	many	cases,	they were	first	created	to	help	people	to	perform	tasks	better	or	faster,	but were	also	adapted	later	for	the	purposes	of	warfare.  As	AI	and	robotics	continue	to	develop,	military	organizations	will	most likely	figure	out	ways	they	can	be	used	for	their	benefit.  In	August	of	2017,	Elon	Musk,	along	with	116	CEOs	and	AI	researchers from	a	collection	of	26	countries,	came	together	to	sign	an	open	letter asking	the	United	Nations	to	ban	the	use	of	AI	weapons.{335}  You	can	view	the	contents	of	this	letter,	as	well	as	the	names	of	those who	signed	it,	at:	https:  futureoflife.org autonomous-weapons-open- letter-2017  One	important	line	from	this	open	letter	states	that:  “Once	[lethal	autonomous	weapons]	are	developed,	they	will	permit armed	conflict	to	be	fought	at	a	scale	greater	than	ever,	and	at timescales	faster	than	humans	can	comprehend.	Once	this	Pandora’s Box	is	opened,	it	will	be	hard	to	close.	We	therefore	implore	the	High Contracting	Parties	to	find	a	way	to	protect	us	all	from	these	dangers.”{336}  Hopefully,	the	support	garnered	by	leaders	in	the	field	of	robotics	and	AI will	encourage	others	in	the	industry	to	follow	suit.  A	similar	type	of	open	letter,	published	by	Toby	Walsh,	admonishes countries	against	starting	a	military-based	AI	arms	race.	This	letter	has been	signed	by	3,105	researchers	in	the	AI	and	robotics	industries,	along with	17,701	others.	You	can	view	the	letter	and	sign	it	yourself	at: https:  futureoflife.org open-letter-autonomous-weapons  Max	Tegmark,	founder	of	the	Future	of	Life	Institute,	warns	that	we	need to	properly	prepare	for	the	future	by	getting	advanced	AI	right	the	first time.	According	to	Tegmark,	with	other	inventions	and	discoveries,	such as	fire,	humans	had	a	chance	to	make	mistakes	and	learn	from	them,	but   as	fire,	humans	had	a	chance	to	make	mistakes	and	learn	from	them,	but we	don’t	have	that	luxury	with	advanced	super	AI.  In	the	field	of	advanced	super	AI,	even	small	mistakes	in	planning	could lead	to	big	problems	in	the	future.	To	prevent	this	from	happening, Tegmark	urges	everyone	involved	to	engage	in	“safety	engineering.”	Key examples	of	this	would	be	banning	the	use	of	lethal	autonomous weapons,	and	ensuring	that	the	benefits	generated	by	AI	are	fairly distributed	throughout	society.{337}  Additionally,	if	you	are	interested	in	following	and	learning	more	about these	kinds	of	issues,	I	encourage	you	to	get	involved	with	the	Future	of Life	Institute,	which	can	be	found	at:	https:  futureoflife.org get-involved   	   101:	How	Can	You	Prepare	for	the	Era	of	AI?  Have	you	enjoyed	the	ideas	and	insights	that	you’ve	encountered	in	the book	so	far?	The	last	recommendation	I	would	like	to	offer	is	simply	to make	your	own	AI	plan	and	take	action!  Think	about	the	ideas	that	have	been	presented	on	the	ways	that	AI	will change	our	future.	Which	do	you	personally	find	to	be	the	most fascinating	and	relevant	for	your	work	or	personal	life?	Pick	three	key ideas	and	form	a	plan	to	either	learn	more	about	them	or	start	to implement	them.  I	would	also	encourage	you	to	consider	this	wise	recommendation	from Gerd	Leonhard:	“Embrace	technology,	but	don’t	become	it.”  It	is	a	great	thing	to	learn	new	ways	to	implement	AI	and	other	kinds	of technology	in	your	life	or	work,	but	at	the	same	time,	it	is	even	more important	to	work	on	yourself,	focusing	on	becoming	a	better,	stronger, and	healthier	human	being.  It	is	also	important	not	to	go	to	extremes,	like	avoiding	AI	altogether	or depending	on	it	too	much.	As	with	most	things	in	life,	moderation	is	key. Let	artificial	intelligence	assist	you	in	your	life,	but	don’t	let	it	take	over	or become	your	life.	Don’t	lose	sight	of	the	importance	of	appreciating	the wonders	of	the	human	experience.	We	should	never	stop	trying	to	learn and	grow	and	improve	ourselves.	We	should	also	always	work	hard	on those	qualities	that	can	enhance	the	human	experience,	like	social	and emotional	intelligence,	creativity,	and	overall	wellbeing.  Remember	that	there	will	be	plenty	of	people	you	will	meet	who	may need	help	recognizing	the	applications	and	benefits	of	new	technologies. Be	willing	to	share	what	you	know!  Last,	but	not	least,	take	action	and	see	how	far	you	can	go!
