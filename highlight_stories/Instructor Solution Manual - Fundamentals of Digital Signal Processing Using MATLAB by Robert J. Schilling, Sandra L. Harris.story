Is this also true for noncausal signals?  Solution  For a causal signal xa t , the one-sided Laplace transform can be extended to a two-sided transform without changing the result.  Xa s  = Z ∞  −∞  xa t  exp −st dt  If s is now replaced by j2πf , this reduces to the Fourier transform Xa f   in  1.2.16 . Thus the spectrum of a causal signal can be obtained from the Laplace transform as follows.  Xa f   = Xa s s=j2πf  if  xa t  = 0 for t < 0  This is not true for a noncausal signal where xa t  6= 0 for t < 0.  9    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Solution   a  From Appendix 2  xa t  = sin 4πt  + sin 4πt  cos2 2πt   = sin 4πt  + .5 sin 4πt [1 + cos 4πt ]  = sin 4πt  + .5 sin 4πt  + .5 sin 4πt  cos 4πt  = sin 4πt  + .5 sin 4πt  + .25 sin 8πt   Thus the highest frequency present in xa t  is F0 = 4 Hz.   b  From Proposition 1.1, to avoid aliasing fs > 8 Hz.

Interesting enough, this informal formulation is not quite correct. To verify this, consider the following simple signal.  xa t  = sin 2πt    a  Find the magnitude spectrum of xa t , and verify that the highest frequency present is  F0 = 1 Hz.   b  Suppose xa t  is sampled at the rate fs = 2 Hz. Sketch the magnitude spectrum of xa t   and the sampled signal, ˆxa t . Do the replicated spectra overlap?   c  Compute the samples x k  = xa kT   using the sampling rate fs = 2 Hz. Is it possible to reconstruct xa t  from x k  using the reconstruction formula in Proposition 1.2 in this instance?   d  Restate the sampling theorem in terms of the highest frequency present, but this time  correctly.  Solution   a  From Table A2 in Appendix 2  Xa f   =  j[δa f + 1  − δa f − 1 ]  Thus the magnitude spectrum of xa t  is  Aa f   =  δa f + 1  + δa f − 1   2  2  Clearly, the highest frequency present is F0 = 1 Hz. See sketch.   b  Yes, the replicated spectra do overlap  see sketch . In this instance, the overlapping  spectra cancel one another.   c  When fs = 2, the samples are  No, it is not possible to reconstruct xa t  from these samples using Proposition 1.2.   d  A signal must be sampled at a rate that is higher than twice the highest frequency  present to avoid aliasing.  x k  = sin 2πkT    = sin πk  = 0  13    2012 Cengage Learning.

Use the impulse response,  ha t , to explain your answer.  Solution  From Example 1.4, an ideal lowpass ﬁlter with gain one and cutoﬀ frequency B has the following impulse response  ha t  = 2Bsinc 2Bt   Therefore ha t  6= 0 for t < 0. This makes the impulse response a noncausal signal and the system that produced it a noncausal system. Noncausal systems are not physically realizable because the system would have to anticipate the input  an impulse at time t = 0  and respond to it before it occurred.  15    2012 Cengage Learning.

In order for σyx k  to reach its maximum positive value at k = 2, one must have maximum positive correlation starting at k = 2.

Since L is a power of two and N is the smallest power of two such that N ≥ 2L − 1, it follows that  Thus from  4.4.10 , the number of complex FLOPs required to compute Hz is L log2 2L . From  4.5.7  there a four real multiplications per complex multiplication. Thus the compu- tation of Hz requires the following number of real FLOPs.  N = 2L  n1 = 4L log2 2L  FLOPs  Next consider step 2 of Alg. 4.1. From  4.4.10 , the computation of Xiz requires L log2 2L  complex FLOPs, and from Algorithm 4.4, the computation of yi requires L log2 2L  + 2L complex FLOPs plus 2L real FLOPs to scale by 1 N . Thus the number of real FLOPs per iteration is 8L log2 2L  + 8L + 2L. From step 2, there are Q iterations where Q = M L.

Let xz k  be a zero-padded version of x k  using M − N zeros. Suppose a radix-two FFT is used to ﬁnd Xz i .   a  Find a lower bound on M that ensures that the frequency precision of Xz i  is no larger  than 2 Hz.   b  How much faster or slower is the FFT of xz k  in comparison with the DFT of x k ? Ex- press your answer as a ratio of the computational eﬀort of the FFT to the computational eﬀort of the DFT.  Solution   a  From  4.8.11  the frequency increment is ∆f = fs M . Thus we want fs M ≤ ∆f or   b  From  4.4.2 , the number of FLOPs for the N -point DFT of x k  is  To apply a radix-two FFT M ≥ 800 must be a power of two. Thus M = 1024.

Suppose the data x k  is real.   a  Find the number of complex FLOPs needed if the DFT is used.   b  Find the number of complex FLOPs needed if the FFT is used.  Solution   a  Since x k  is real, the multiplications by the window w k  are real FLOPs. The ith row of the spectrogram requires an L-point DFT and there are 2M − 1 rows. From  4.4.2  an L-point DFT requires L2 2 complex FLOPs. Thus the total number of complex FLOPs per spectrogram using a DFT is   b  Assuming L is a power of 2, a radix 2 FFT can be used. From  4.4.10 , an L-point FFT requires L log2 L  2 FLOPs. Thus the total number of FLOPs per spectrogram using an FFT is  mDF T =   2M − 1 L2  2  mF F T =   2M − 1 L log2 L   2  323    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Use complex FLOPs to measure the computational eﬀort and assume x k  is real.   c  Does the modiﬁed spectrogram have improved frequency resolution? If not, how can the  frequency resolution be improved and what is the tradeoﬀ?  Solution   a  Let xm k  be the mth subsignal deﬁned in  4.9.1 . Next let xmz  k  be the zero-padded version of xm using L zeros padded to the end of xm k . Thus xmz k  is of length 2L.  xmz  k  ∆=  cid:26  xm k   0  , 0 ≤ k < L , L ≤ k < 2L  Next let ˆw k  be a window of length 2L, The modiﬁed spectrogram ˆG m, i  is then a  2M − 1  × 2L matrix deﬁned  ˆG m, i  = DFT{ ˆw k xmz k }   b  Since x k  is real, the multiplications by the window are real FLOPs. If the FFT is used, then an N -point FFT requires N log2 N   2 complex FLOPs. Since there are 2M − 1 rows, the total number of FLOPs for the two cases are  Thus the percent increase in computational eﬀort measured by complex FLOPs is  mF F T =  ˆmF F T =   2M − 1 L log2 L   2M − 1 2L log2 2L   2  2  p =  100  ˆmF F T − mF F T    mF F T  =  =  100[ 2M − 1 L log2 2L  − .5 2M − 1 L log2 L ]  .5 2M − 1 L log2 L   100[ log2 2L  − .5 log2 L ]  .5 log2 L   324    2012 Cengage Learning.

This improves the frequency precision, but not the frequency resolution. To improve frequency resolution more data samples must be added to xm k  by increasing L. The tradeoﬀ is that by increasing L one increases frequency resolution, but at the expense of decreasing time resolution because now M must be decreased since M L = N .  325    2012 Cengage Learning.

This is particularly the case when no overlap of subsignals is used.   a  Use the trigonometric identities in Appendix 2 to show that the Hanning window in  Table 4.10 can be expressed as  w k  = .5 + .5 cos cid:20  2π k − L 2   L   cid:21   ,  0 ≤ k < L   b  If a 50% overlap of subsignals is used for the power density spectrum estimate, then each overlapped sample gets counted twice, once with weight w k  and once with weight w k + L 2 . Show that if the Hanning window is used, the overlapped samples are weighted equally. Find the total weight for each overlapped sample.   c  Are there any other windows in Table 4.10 for which the total weighting of the overlapped  samples is uniform when a 50% overlap is used? If so, which ones?  Solution   a  Using the cosine of the diﬀerence trigonometric identity from Appendix 2  w k  = .5 + .5 cos cid:20  2π k − L 2   L   cid:21   L  cid:19  cos π  + sin cid:18  2πk = .5 + .5 cid:20 cos cid:18  2πk = .5 − .5 cos cid:18  2πk L  cid:19   L  cid:19  sin π  cid:21   wT  k  = w k  + w k + L 2   = .5 − .5 cos cid:18  2πk  L  cid:19  + .5 + .5 cos cid:18  2πk L  cid:19   = 1   b  With a 50 percent overlap, each overlapped sample is counted twice. Using the results of part   a , the total sample weight using the Hanning window is   c  The only other window for which the total weighting of the overlapped samples is uniform,  when a 50 percent overlap is used, is the rectangular window.  326    2012 Cengage Learning.

What happens to the phase response at f = F0?  Solution   a  From  5.3.5 , the polar form of the amplitude response is  Ar f   = A f   exp[jβ f  ]  Here β f   is piecewise constant with values jumping between 0 and π when A f   = 0. Thus  A f   = Ar f     b  If A f   6= Ar f   for f > F0, then they diﬀer by a sign with  Ar f   = −A f    ,  f < F0  This occurs if β f   jumps from 0 to π at f = F0. Therefore the phase response φ f   jumps by π at f = F0.  403    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Solution   a  For a linear-phase ﬁlter the impulse response must exhibit either even or odd symmetry  about the midpoint as in h m − k  = ±h k . Thus there are two solutions.  h1 k  = [2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 2] h2 k  = [2, 4, 3,−3, −4,−2]   b  From Table 5.1, h1 k  is a type 2 linear-phase ﬁlter, and h2 k  is a type 4 linear-phase  ﬁlter.   c  Again from Table 5.1, the phase oﬀsets for the two ﬁlters are α1 = 0 and α2 = π 2.  406    2012 Cengage Learning.

Solution   a  The factored numerator polynomial is  b z  = 2 z + 1.25  z + j.5  z − j.5   Thus the only zero outside the unit circle is z1 = −1.25. Using  5.4.9 , replace  z − z1  by  z − 1 z1  and multiply by −z1.   b  One must replace the zeros inside the unit circle with their reciprocals and multiply by  the negative of each replaced zero. The zeros inside the unit circle are z2,3 = ±j.5.  Hmin z  = −z1 z − 1 z1 H z   z − z1  2.5 z + .8 2 z2 + .25   =  z z2 − .81   Hmax z  =  z2z3 z − 1 z2  z − 1 z3 H z    z − z2  z − z3   .25 z − j2  z + j2 2 z + 1.25   z z2 − .81  .5 z2 + 4  z + 1.25   =  =  z z2 − .81    c  Since there are three zeros, there are potentially 23 = 8 separate transfer functions. However, for real coeﬃcients, the complex conjugate zeros must remain complex con- jugate pairs. This reduces the number distinct transfer functions to four: a minimum phase, a maximum phase, and two mixed phase transfer functions.  408    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

H z  =  1 + 3z−1 +  α + β z−2 + 2z−3 2 +  α − β z−1 + 3z−2 + z−3  Solution  The coeﬃcients of an allpass transfer function must exhibit the reﬂective structure or reverse symmetry property in  5.4.7 . From inspection, this requires  α + β = α − β  Thus 2β = 0 or β = 0. There is no constraint on α.  409    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Solution   a  The factored numerator polynomial is  b z  = 10 z − 2  z + 2  z − j.5  z + j.5   Thus there are two zeros outside the unit circle at z1,2 = ±2.

If so, construct an example. If not,   b  Is it possible for H z  to be an allpass ﬁlter? If so, construct an example. If not, why  why not?  not?  Solution   a  The general form of a FIR ﬁlter of order m = 2 is  H z  = b0 + b1z−1 + b2z−2  For H z  to be linear phase, h k  = bk must exhibit even or odd symmetry about k = 1. For H z  to be minimum phase, the zeros must not lie outside the unit circle. Yes, it is possible for a linear-phase FIR ﬁlter to be minimum phase. The following is a general type 1 example where 0 ≤ θ < 2π.  H z  =  =  z2  α[z − exp jθ ][z − exp −jθ ] α{z2 − [exp jθ  + exp −jθ ]z + 1 α[z2 − 2 cos θ z + 1]  z2  = = α[1 − 2 cos θ z−1 + z−2]  z2   b  From  5.4.7 , the coeﬃcients of the transfer function for a second-order allpass ﬁlter  must exhibit reverse symmetry as follows.  H z  =  a2 + a1z−1 + a0z−2 a0 + a1z−1 + a2z−2  For an FIR Filter, the denominator coeﬃcient vector is a = [1, 0, 0]T. Thus for a second- order FIR ﬁlter to be allpass, it is necessary that  However, h k  = δ k − 2  does not exhibit even or odd symmetry about k = 1, which means that it is not linear-phase. Therefore it is not possible for a second-order linear- phase FIR ﬁlter to be an allpass ﬁlter.  H z  = z−2  413    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Find a nonzero periodic signal x k  that gets completely attenuated by the ﬁlter.   b  If a zero of a second-order block starts out on the unit circle, will the radius of the zero change as a result of the coeﬃcient quantization? That is, will the zero still be on the unit circle?   c  If a zero of a second-order block starts out on the unit circle, will the angle of the zero change as a result of the coeﬃcient quantization? That is, will the frequency of the zero change?  Solution   a  Here fs = 300 Hz and z0 = exp jπ 3 . The zero z0 is on the unit circle at  Thus 2f0T = 1 3 or  z0 = exp j2πf0T    = exp jπ 3   f0 =  1 6T  = 50 Hz  The following periodic signal  a pure tone at f0 = 50 Hz  will be completely blocked by the ﬁlter. Here a 6= 0 and ψ are arbitrary.  x k  = a cos 2πf0kT + ψ   = a cos πk 3 + ψ    b  Using second-order blocks and  6.9.18 , the radius of the zero will not change due to  coeﬃcient quantization. Therefore, the zero will still be on the unit circle.   c  Yes, the frequency of the zero of a quantized second-order block will change because the  middle coeﬃcient in  6.9.18  depends on the zero angle θ0.  501    2012 Cengage Learning.

Solution   a  The transfer function can be written as  H z  =  z4 + 25.04z2 + 1  z2  = 1 + 25.04z−1 + z−2  Thus the impulse response is h k  = {1, 25.04, 1}.

Ha s  =  β s − z1  s − z2  · · ·  s − zm   s − p1  s − p2  · · ·  s − pn   An alternative way to convert an analog ﬁlter into a digital ﬁlter is to map each pole and zero of Ha s  into a corresponding pole and zero of H z  using z = exp sT  . This yields:  H z  =  b0 z + 1 n−m[z − exp z1T  ][z − exp z2T  ] · · · [z − exp zmT  ]  [z − exp p1T  ][z − exp p2T  ] · · ·[z − exp pnT  ]  Note that if n > m, then Ha s  has n − m zeros at s = ∞.

To achieve the same average power of the quantization noise at the output, but without using oversampling, how many bits are required?  Solution  From  8.7.12 , the quantization noise power of a B-bit ADC with oversampling by a factor of M is the same as the quantization noise power of an N -bit ADC without oversampling. Thus one can set B = 12, M = 64 and solve for N .  N = B +  log2 M    log2 64   2  2  = 12 +  = 12 + 3  = 15 bits  Note that each additional bit corresponds to oversampling by a factor of four.  725    2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Solution   a  Since x k  is white noise uniformly distributed over [a, b] it can be represented as follows.  x k  = µx + v k   Here µx =  a + b  2 is the mean and v k  is zero-mean white noise uniformly distributed over [−c, c] where c =  b − a  2.

Consider the following input.  x k  = 2 + sin πk 2  + v k   Find the input auto-correlation matrix R. Does your answer reduce to that of Problem 9.4 when c = 0?  Solution  When two signals are statistically independent, the expected value of their product is equal to the product of the expected value. From  9.2.15 , Deﬁnition 9.1, and the trigonometric identities in Appendix 2, the auto-correlation matrix is  Rij = rxx j − i   = E[x k x k − j + i ] = E[{2 + sin πk 2  + v k }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2  + v k − j + i }] = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 } + {2 + sin πk 2 }v k − j + i  +  v k {2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 } + v k v k − j + i ]  = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] + E[2 + sin πk 2 ]E[v k − j + i ] +  E[v k ]E[2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2  + E[v k v k − j + i ]  Since v k  is uniformly distributed about [−c, c], its mean is zero. Thus  Rij = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] + E[v k v k − j + i ]  The samples of the white noise are statistically independent of one another. Thus when i 6= i, E[v k v k− j + i ] = E[v k ]E[v k− j + i ]. Hence from  9.2.8 , the expression for the input auto-correlation matrix reduces to  Rij = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] + δ i − j E[v k v k − j + i ]  = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] + δ i − j E[v2 k ] = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] + δ i − j Pv = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] + δ i − j  cid:26  c3 −  −c 3 3[c −  −c ] cid:27  = E[{2 + sin πk 2 }{2 + sin π[k − j + i] 2 }] +  c2 3 δ i − j   773    2012 Cengage Learning.

During normal operation of the linear system, the input x k  has relatively poor spectral content.   a  Which of the modiﬁed LMS methods would appear to be an appropriate choice? Why?   b  How might the input be modiﬁed slightly to improve identiﬁcation without signiﬁcantly  aﬀecting the normal operation of the system?  Solution   a  The leaky LMS method would be best because it has the aﬀect of adding low-level white noise to the input thereby improving the spectral content. This makes the algorithm more stable when the input has poor spectral content.   b  The input could be modiﬁed by explicitly adding low-level white noise to improve its spectral content. By keeping the noise low level, this should not signiﬁcantly interfere with the normal operation of the system.  If Px is the average power of the original input, then the average power of the white noise should be small in comparison with Px.  For example, if v k  is white noise uniformly distributed over [−c, c], then v k  has zero mean and from  9.2.8  the average power of v k  is  Thus the bound on the amplitude of the uniform white noise should satisfy c2 3  cid:28  Px or  ˆx k  = x k  + v k   Pv  cid:28  Px  Pv =  =  c3 −  −c 3 3[c −  −c ] c2 3  c  cid:28  p3Px  783    2012 Cengage Learning.

Gi z  =   cos2i cid:16  πz  2  cid:17  ,  0  ,  z ≤ 1 z > 1   a  Show that Gi z  qualiﬁes as an RBF for i ≥ 1.  b  Does Gi z  have compact support?  c  Show that Gi z  reduces to the raised-cosine RBF when i = 1.  Solution   a  The function Gi z  is continuous for i ≥ 1 because cos2i ±π 2  = 0. Next  Similarly, it is clear that  Gi 0  = cos2i 0   = 1  Gi z  → 0 as z → ∞  Thus the two properties in  9.9.17  hold. Hence Gi z  is a valid radial basis function for i ≥ 1.   b  The function Gi z  does have compact support because Gi z  = 0 for z  ∈ S where S is  the compact  closed and bounded  set S = [−1, 1].   c  Let i = 1.

Show that the RBF model S0 converges uniformly to the nonlinear system Sf as d approaches inﬁnity. That is, show that  Solution  The function f : U → R is continuously diﬀerentiable. Let ∇f = ∂f  u  ∂u be the gradient vector of partial derivatives of f  u  with respect to the elements of u. Consider the following norms.  Since f  u  is continuously diﬀerentiable, ∇f  u  is continuous. But ∇f : U → R and U ⊂ Rp is compact. Therefore k∇f  u k∞ achieves a maximum value on the set U . Let  Suppose wi = f  ui  for 0 ≤ i < r.

Suppose the weight vector w is constant. Taking the transpose of  9.2.3 , and replacing the actual output by the desired output, yields  uT  k w = d k   ,  0 ≤ k < N  Let d = [d 0 , d 1 , . . . , d N − 1 ]T and let X be an N ×  m + 1  past input matrix whose ith row is uT  i  for 0 ≤ i < N . Then the N equations can be recast as the following vector equation.  When N >  m + 1 , this constitutes an over-determined linear algebraic system of equations. A weight vector that minimizes the squared error E =  Xw − d T  Xw − d  is obtained by Normal premultiplying both sides by X T . This yields the normal equations  equations  Xw = d  X T Xw = X T d  w =  X T X −1X T d  The coeﬃcient matrix X T X is  m + 1  ×  m + 1 . If x k  has adequate spectral content, X T X will be nonsingular. In this case the optimal weight vector in a least-squares sense can be obtained by premultiplying by the inverse of X T X which yields  Write a MATLAB function called f lsﬁt that computes the optimal least-squares FIR ﬁlter weight vector, b = w, by solving the normal equations using the MATLAB left division operator, \.

This second edition text focuses on the fundamentals of digital signal processing with an emphasis on practical applications. In order to motivate students, many of the examples illustrate the processing of speech and music. This theme is also a focus of the course software that features facilities for recording and playing sound on a standard PC. The accompanying website contains a comprehensive MATLAB software package called the Fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing (FDSP) toolbox version 2.0. The FDSP toolbox includes chapter GUI modules, an extensive library of DSP functions, direct access to all of the computational examples, figures, and tables, solutions to selected problems, and onliine help documentation. Using the interactive GUI modules, students can explore, compare, and directly experience the effects of signal processing techniques without any need for programming.
