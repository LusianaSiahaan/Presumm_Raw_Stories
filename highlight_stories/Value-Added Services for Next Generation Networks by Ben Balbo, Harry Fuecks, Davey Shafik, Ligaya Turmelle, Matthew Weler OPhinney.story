In  this  book,  let’s  undertake  a  quest  for  the  real  “added  value”  of  modern   I  never  liked  general  statements  such  as  “eﬃcient  communications  increase  productivity” or “social persons communicate frequently.” Aren’t our buddies and  colleagues being ﬂooded by the numerous calls, messages and streaming media?  What are we, our employers or advertisers willing to pay for true communication  means? Are our children going to adopt them or will they invent their own? Will  our machines start communicating in unpredictable ways?  This book is not only about technology itself; also on how it is being used and   could be used in the best possible way.  We have a long way to go to be able to conceive Value-Added Services  VAS  for  Next Generation Networks  NGN  — at least that’s my feeling at the start of this  book. A NGN is not so easy to deﬁne either.  It’s going to be a dangerous journey; we might lose ourselves in the wilderness  of networks, the ecosystem of companies, or daunting traﬃc predictions. We might  end up with a list of dozens of possible services with no way to prioritize or even  understand their extent.  Let’s therefore weapon ourselves for the trip! In this chapter, we’ll take a helicopter tour over the basic forces  “dimensions”?    which to my opinion are structuring modern communication means:   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   Means and appropriateness Contextual and interactive portions Device, connectivity and service  1   2  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Traditionally, communication means would have been classiﬁed as   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78    cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   cid:78   Cellular, mobile and wireless Presence and availability Immediate and deferred mode On-demand, triggered and periodic Personal contacts and tribes Location based  Fixed or mobile Voice, text, video or data Pre- or postpaid Retail or wholesale Circuit- or packet-switched Point-to-point or multiparty Best-eﬀort or guaranteed Quality-of-Service Private or public  But in the context of the Next Generation Networks, these refer to the properties of  bit pipes  connectivity  rather than to recognizable communication services.  And this book is about genuine communication services, not about connectivity.  Figure 1.1 Basic forces structuring modern communication means.   Basic Forces   cid:78  3  Let’s therefore try and walk a diﬀerent path; let’s try and uncover the essence of   a communication service.  But before that, perhaps we can start by deﬁning and delineating communica- tion against its two natural rivals: storage and computing. The relationship between  communication, storage and computing is in constant evolution; allied to provide  one communication service, they are enemies for the next one.  1.1 Symbolic Devices  We all know, from what we experience and within ourselves, that our  conscious acts spring from our desires and our fears. Intuition tells us  that that is true also of our fellows and of the higher animals. We all  try to escape pain and death, while we seek what is pleasant. We are all  ruled in what we do by impulses; and these impulses are so organized  that our actions in general serve for our self preservation and that of   Figure 1.2 Albert Einstein playing the violin.   4  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  the race. Hunger, love, pain, fear are some of those inner forces which  rule the individual’s instinct for self preservation. At the same time,  as social beings, we are moved in the relations with our fellow beings  by such feelings as sympathy, pride, hate, need for power, pity, and so  on. All these primary impulses, not easily described in words, are the  springs of man’s actions. All such action would cease if those powerful  elemental forces were to cease stirring within us. Though our conduct  seems so very diﬀerent from that of the higher animals, the primary  instincts are much alike in them and in us.  The most evident diﬀerence springs from the important part which is  played in man by a relatively strong power of imagination and by the capac- ity to think, aided as it is by language and other symbolic devices.  Thought is the organizing factor in man, intersected between the  causal primary instincts and the resulting actions. In that way imagina- tion and intelligence enter into our existence in the part of servants of  the primary instincts. But their intervention makes our acts to serve ever  less merely the immediate claims of our instincts.  —Albert Einstein  Following the reasoning of the great scientist, language and symbolic devices help  us to construct imagination and intelligence: the tools that mitigate the eﬀect of  our primary instincts on our acts.  From the picture above, I’m sure Einstein would have named music as one of   the symbolic devices.  Some symbolic devices such as the mathematical and physical formalisms have  helped mankind to construct the intelligence to address basic impulses such as cold   with electricity from nuclear energy , fear  with insight on the origin and evolution  of the universe  and need for power  with atomic weapons .  Science,  art,  medicine,  religions,  political  systems,  law  and  economics  have   become the major symbolic devices in today’s world.  It is in that prestigious enumeration that we would like to add telecommunica- tions one day: not what is said in the billions of daily phone calls, messages, and  Web pages; not the copper wire, glass ﬁber, and ethereal networks themselves; but  the set of underlying protocols, network structures, and procedures used by man- kind to communicate.  Communication  is  essential  for  life  —  would  the  Darwinist  evolution  have   taken place without it?  But in the big picture of things, speech and languages are relative novelties. Early humans must have developed speech and languages for rather functional  reasons, such as to give each other simple orders, to teach children faster how to  survive, or to join forces when hunting. Speech and languages were born as the  direct servants of the primary instincts.   Basic Forces   cid:78  5  As cognitive intelligence grew, so did the number of abstract topics  e.g., love,  war, religion, possessions, tribes  and the number of words available to construct  spoken phrases. Speech and languages became tools to construct intelligence and  imagination, through a process of sustained communication.  It is indeed hard to imagine building intelligence and imagination in complete  isolation. As the great Einstein would say, “The secret of creativity is knowing how  to hide your sources.”  The relationship between communication, intelligence and imagination is fas- cinating. Our knowledge economy depends on people ﬁnding the right balance.  What will be the future role of communication?  1.2 Communication and Storage Did communication grow out of knowledge or the reverse?  The human need for communication fuelled the development of diﬀerent means  which today we would call “media.” In order of appearance: speech, theatre, the  telegraph, telephone, radio, TV, cellular communications, sms, chatting, blogging,  podcasting, and so on.  Most of these communication channels could not have emerged without an  underlying support at the end points  some “storage” means : more brain cells for  speech, the grotto wall for paintings, papyrus for writing, printed books, newspa- pers, photo paper, movie ﬁlm, vinyl records, magnetic storage, computer memory,  ﬁle systems, optical storage  CD, DVD , nonvolatile memory, and so on.  These storage means are the support for all our knowledge. The rest are thoughts,   experience and imagination.  In the course of history, communication and storage have gone hand in hand.  More brain cells meant more speech. More writing skills meant an increased need  for papyrus. Gutenberg’s printed bible was read by a whole new category of readers,  who couldn’t have aﬀorded the medieval calligraphy. And so on.  But today, communication and storage seem to compete with each other on a   daily basis, and to exclude each other for various reasons.  Should  we  have  a  conference  call  on  this  project   communication   or  await  everyone’s written input  storage ? Knowing that most conference calls are not min- uted  stored  anymore …  Should I e-mail this document to my colleagues  communication  or post it on   our intranet  storage ?  leave a voicemail  storage ?  Am I going to take incoming calls  communication , or are the callers going to   Is attending that Webinar  communication  really going to be more useful than   using a search engine on the same topic  storage ?  In my instant messenger, do I say hello  communication  or do I just publish   my presence  storage ?   6  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Is digital TV a truly interactive experience with potentially thousands of chan- nels on very specialized and local topics  communication , or will it only allow me to  watch previous shows and download movies on demand  storage ?  Why  is  wireless  broadband  access   WiFi   suddenly  built  into  this  new  por- table gaming device? For multiplayer games  communication  or to download new  games  storage ?  The line may seem thin between “genuine” communication and “just” the elec-  tronic transmission of stored media. But it isn’t!  Genuine communication diﬀerentiates itself from stored media transmission   with timeliness, expectation, and unpredictability.  As the time increases between the production of the data and their transfer,  such as in the case of books, art exhibitions or song downloads, people tend not to  qualify this as communication anymore. Even though press critics clearly provide  feedback on books, movies and recorded music  the bidirectional aspect .  If the initiator expects a response, communication takes place, even if technically  no response may actually come. Sending an application letter to a company would  qualify as genuine communication, posting your curriculum vitae online wouldn’t. Unpredictability is required too. Is using a search engine genuine communica- tion? No — do the same query in 5 minutes and it will result in the same results.  In a corporate organization, the outcome of a Web training is less predictable  in  terms of questions from the attendants, unexpected disagreement, next actions aris- ing, etc.  than the outcome of a written note on the same subject, to the same list  of persons  of which the impact will probably be more limited . The Web training  would qualify as genuine communication; the note would be only transmission of  stored media.  The volume of data, or the pace at which it is transferred, plays no role to qual- ify an interaction as “communication.” For example, one sigh says more  can better  be qualiﬁed as genuine communication  than a thousand words. And people are  willing to pay 50 cents to send one byte of information  a single digit  in a televot- ing sms taking 10 seconds to reach the TV show. But 1 Euro sounds expensive for  a megabyte of high-speed mobile data traﬃc  for example, containing 10 e-mails .  A higher volume and speed are not necessarily perceived as more valuable com- munication. There’s a common belief that broadband services actually kill more  value   the  revenue  of  narrowband  services   than  the  amount  of  new  value  they  create. Volume and bandwidth are rapidly commoditized, genuine communication  services probably won’t be.  Is  genuine  communication  more  attractive  and  valuable  than  long-term   storage?  Not necessarily. Things change with age. Teenagers may have many contacts  with peers, but as life advances, elderly people love their music collection, movies,  books and photo albums.  For sure, the transfer of stored media over IP networks has become a commodity,  and it is still a question whether the residential end user is willing to pay for    Basic Forces   cid:78  7  some quality of service, even if enforced end-to-end — even if corporations,  large and small, might find telepresence  videoconferencing over IP  extremely  valuable.  It is essential for modern telecommunication service providers to position them- selves relative to genuine communication versus the transmission of stored media:  should they invent and launch new communication means, or provide high quality  bit pipes for stored contents they don’t interpret? Are they going to deliver Value- Added Services or just Next Generation Networks? Are they going to be the diplomat  or the pigeon?  Failing to specialize and be successful in the one or the other, some of them  may be tempted to become the bard — the creators of stored content — resulting in  investments in portals to walled gardens, movie-on-demand servers, soccer broad- casting rights, music catalogs, and so on.  These digressions from the original company mission and core business cannot  be justiﬁed with the need to demonstrate the usefulness of the bit pipes. Remember  these nineteenth-century railway-owned station buﬀets — passengers arrived there  by very useful trains  the bit pipes  but who would have considered them to be rep- resentative for the visited town’s culinary scene  the content ? Railway companies  don’t attract the best cooks or the most motivated waiters.  In conclusion, it sounds fair to say that storage  including the commoditized  transmission of stored media  on one side, and genuine communication means on  the other, have today become enemies, and can tear apart each other’s business  models, companies and end users.  1.3 Communication and Computing True communications are clearly fuelled by the advances in computing.  It sounds unbelievable that the major inventions for the digital age  the transistor,  the microchip, magnetic and optical storage  all happened less than 50 years ago, that  the Internet appeared less than 20 years ago. That the GSM handsets evolved from a  cell phone to a networked personal computer in less than 10 years — at the center of  their own personal access network of Bluetooth headsets, car kits and keyboards.  Computing is still in its expansion phase and the movement seems to accelerate. Wireless broadband technology is going to expand the reach of the Internet  into remote areas without copper pairs or even without electricity; therefore creat- ing new markets for low cost computing devices  laptop PCs, batteries and solar  panels .  The  expansion  of  computing  is  not  restricted  by  the  number  of  humans  —  therefore by the human assimilation bandwidth or human desire to communicate.  Cars and household appliances contain computers. Our electricity meters might  soon contain one. Radio-frequency identiﬁcation  RFID  tags would allow every  item in a clothes shop to contain a disposable computer. Watches will soon contain    8  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  a computer transmitting the heartbeat rate to the Internet, via Wibree and your  mobile phone, during your jogging. A personal trainer might even return advice to  you, in real time, to your Bluetooth headset, again containing a computer.  As computing expands toward the edges, so will transmission and storage, but  will the telecommunication sector  i.e., telecommunication service providers  ben- eﬁt from this movement?  Also, what are the forces limiting this expansion? Some  people  feel  unhappy  about  the  ineﬃcient  use  of  computing  resources  made by modern operating systems and distributed software. It is not sure that  people will keep buying ever more computing power to cope with this. Virtual- ization, Web services and Display-over-IP  DoIP  terminals will save computing  resources, by simplifying the user device and recentralizing computing, storage and  software as a pool of on-demand resources.  The success of memory sticks and media players using media compression tech- nology  e.g., MP3, AAC, MPEG4  resulted from the need to save on nonvolatile  memory but also illustrates a trend away from computing power. Today’s consumers  appear to be willing to pay the same price for a high-end portable media player as  for a basic desktop computer.  Can true, valuable communication appear between computers, rather than  the mere transmission of stored media? We are not so far from this. Comput- ers have started relaying packets for peer-to-peer services, without their human  owners knowing about it. The next step could be that these computers would  make autonomous purchasing decisions for evolving communication services:  for  example,  “quality-of-service”   high  bandwidth  and  throughput,  low  jitter  and  delay ,  “least-cost  routing,”  “unpredictable  results  from  peer  computers.”  The  prerequisite  would  be  that  they   yes,  the  computers!   have  some  form  of  revenue — for example, from humans wishing to pay for better person-to-person  services. Computers could then become targets for some form of “advertising”  by telecom service providers!  One  can  imagine  a  business  model  in  which  telecom  service  providers  would embrace and develop peer-to-peer technology rather than combat it —  for instance, peer-to-peer networks as the wholesale customers of the Next Genera- tion Networks.  Not so unrealistic, since Skype, in 2005, selected four established international  carriers worldwide, to terminate the SkypeOut calls to plain old telephone net- works worldwide.  A next release of Skype and other peer-to-peer clients might automatically estab- lish call segments  probably still packetized voice  over managed quality networks,  in case low voice quality is detected. Skype might submit these calls to gateways,  whose performances  traﬃc handled and voice quality increase  would be assessed  and rewarded  e.g., in the form of SkypeOut credit . Voice quality could be mea- sured technically  e.g., in terms of packet loss, latency, jitter  but also by a network  of human test users granting Mean Opinion Scores  MOS  in real time.   Basic Forces   cid:78  9  Figure 1.3 Storage is the cornerstone of computing, which is likely to fuel com- munication. But storage also pushes back the need for communication.  Managed communication networks and computing end-points may one day   become better allies than communication and storage.  1.4 Means and Appropriateness The explosion of number of available communication and storage methods requires  the originator of the communication, but also the author of stored media to make  frequent choices, based on the context of the communication.  The degree to which timely arrival, a response or unpredictable reactions   i.e., genuine communication  are desired by the originator author will drive him  her to one of the readily available communication means or stored media transmis- sion means.  The ultimate selection of some means requires judgment and careful decision.  The receiver of the genuine communication or the transmitted stored media will  indeed make a judgment whether the means are appropriate for the subject of the  communication or message.  The appropriateness may simply be a matter of common sense, personal inter- pretation and company policy. “Do not send large attachments to our entire staﬀ,  but  post  your  document  on  our  intranet  and  distribute  the  link  only,”  your  IT  administrator might say. “And use YouTube to post your funny joke videos rather  than sending them around as e-mails to your colleagues.”  In some cases, the choice could be so complex that it requires public debate,   laws and or court decisions.  Is it legal to ﬁre an employee by sms? Has the sms delivery notiﬁcation message   the proof that the sms was delivered to the mobile phone  got the legal value of an  assigned letter in such case?   10  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  In the category of stored media transmission, is it appropriate to post someone’s  last words as an MP3 track on the Internet? Is it socially acceptable to set up a Web  site regarding someone’s death and funeral? Or is only the newspaper’s necrology  page regarded as socially acceptable?  How is law going to deal with the subtle distinction between distributing copy- righted electronic content by e-mail  legal , making it available for download on a  home page  illegal , and all forms in between  e.g., peer-to-peer networks, blogs,  chat sessions ?  Is it legal for a content provider to encode protect the contents so it can be  decoded read only on a given computing device? Or be distributed only through a  given telecommunications network?  At present, I am not aware of any law school teaching Digital Rights Manage-  ment  DRM .  Is it a good idea to set up a Web site about your community, advocating the  merits of its shops, restaurants and leisure clubs in good faith? If your site attracts  many visitors, the baker might start giving you your Sunday sandwiches for free,  for his shop to appear on top of the list. Is that socially appropriate behavior, or a  new kind of corruption?  As the number of social conventions and rules also keep growing, the origina- tors and authors could become tired of having to make such decisions of appropri- ateness. The combinatory explosion of mappings between communication means  and social conventions is diﬃcult to learn and to remember.  If the receiver’s availability and preferences are ignored, it may also generate a  sentiment of intrusiveness on the receiver’s side and we’ll discuss that in Section 1.8.  But the point here is that the originator is tired of having to guess what communi- cation means or content format will most please the receiver s , be socially accept- able, legal, and so forth.  The result may be no genuine communication and no production of stored media   at all: a post-Communication society comparable to today’s post-Industrial Age.  Therefore, it may be time to ease the life of originators and authors, by shifting   some of the burden and responsibility to the receiving end.  But have they  the receivers  got the choice today to select the communication   means that are going to be used?  In genuine telecommunications, to a certain degree, the answer is yes. One can  switch oﬀ a mobile phone  a radical method  and expect the callers to try other means   leave a voicemail, call a landline number or interact via instant messaging instead .  Often, the callers won’t. In an average ﬁxed or mobile telecom network today, less  than half of the calls are successfully established between two human end users.  For the transmission of stored media, the receivers have the choice of the deliv- ery channel. For blockbusters, one has the choice to go and see the movie, rent the  DVD, use digital TV  pay-per-view , or download the movie to a computer or set- top box  in divX format , burn it on DVD, and so on. But in most cases, the author    Basic Forces   cid:78  11  will not be able to reproduce the content itself in many formats  e.g., as movie,  book, comic strip, Web site, piece of art .  For genuine telecommunication services to be more successful, things could and  should  be  improved  on  the  receiving  end.  Receivers  of  genuine  communications  deserve a similar degree of choice as the receivers of stored media.  Telecom service providers would then take on the duties to let the user subscribe  to, select, ﬁlter, translate, adapt, store, organize and reroute incoming communica- tions and information, rather than today passively conveying the outgoing communi- cation or information to the selected destination — a commodity.  This paradigm shift is probably too large a step for today’s communication  service providers to take, meaning that new, dedicated organizations will emerge  which will successfully deal with these aspects.   The  knowledge  economy  needs  to  tackle  the  problem  of  communication  means and appropriateness, if it does not want to create a class of the super-  communicating, super-informed, who can assimilate the information streams com- ing in through dozens of channels, and a class of isolated and noninformed people  who feel ﬂooded and anxious. We need a middle class too!  1.5 Contextual and Interactive Portions The  potential  intrusiveness  of  incoming  communications  was  recognized  in  the  corporate and business environment, where human or automated telephone atten- dants,  receptionists  and  call  centers  were  introduced  to  handle  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the call, before connecting the caller through to the ﬁnal destination  the correct  department or most knowledgeable professional .  It is similar to the physical lay-out of many companies, with a reception desk  where the employees provide the ﬁrst layer of interaction with the external world.  The ﬁrst  and sometimes the only  impression that a company makes, is made at  that reception desk.  Modern directory inquiry services are partially human, partially automated.  After a welcome prompt, the system selects an available human attendant. He she  asks  for  the  name  or  address,  looks  up  the  directory  number,  and  immediately  transfers  control  to  the  system,  which  reads  the  number  by  text-to-speech.  The  system then proposes to connect the caller through to the ﬁnal destination, to send  the number by SMS, and so on. It’s been a cost-saving trend: a minimal interactive  human portion is complemented with a growing automated portion.  Calling card services require you to call a free number, key in your card num-  ber, followed by the number you want to reach.  The most basic ﬁxed telephone call today still starts with a sequence where the  caller gets dial tone from the ﬁrst  local  telephone exchange, dials the number and  hears the ring tone produced by the last telephone exchange.   12  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  In the beginning of the twentieth century, before the advent of automatic tele- phone exchanges, the caller would be connected to a switch board attendant and  ask to be connected to a given number.  Part of a telephone communication is contextual; part of it is truly interactive. It is the mix of both which seems to make communication means attractive   and successful.  When the communication is mainly interactive, the contextual portion on the  other hand gives the originator the time to structure his her thoughts. Didn’t you  ever feel confused when  by some technical fault  no ring tones were played but the  called party suddenly took the call?  Some  modern  communication  means  that  used  to  be  purely  interactive  are   evolving to also include a contextual portion.  Chatting and instant messaging, for example, used to be purely interactive. Some  IM users then started to modify their display name every day, telling about their  mood or upcoming activities. Later it was added in as a feature, separate from the  nickname. IM VoIP clients allow users to add a picture, some proﬁle information,  and so forth, that can be viewed by the caller before the actual communication takes  place. Some mobile operators allow their users to select the ring tone that callers will  hear  known as “Personalized Ring Back Tone” or “Colored Ring Tone”  and this  service is a smash hit in some countries  Korea .  Conversely, communication means that used to have only the contextual por-  tion, are now adding the interactive part.  Most company Web sites  and intranets  used to be contextual only. But air- line, insurance company and utility Web sites have been transformed to include  an interactive portion, where people can ﬁll in their phone number and click “Call  Me” buttons. “Skype Me” buttons, which you can insert, for example, in your e- mail signature, make the persons who click this button use their Skype VoIP client  to contact you. On some public and intranet sites, it’s already possible to directly  click other employees, departments or knowledge areas to set up voice-on-Web calls  and video-on-Web sessions.  In the television space, there’s a similar trend where viewers are invited to use SMS,   e-mail or the show’s Web site to participate to the quiz or give their opinion.  Of course people will use diﬀerent communication means in parallel, in some  particular situations. The typical example is chatting during a conference call or  Webinar. Another one is photographing or ﬁlming the surroundings with your  cam  phone,  and  transmitting  that  as  a  video  call,  while  continuing  the  voice  conversation using your Bluetooth headset. These are referred to as combinatory  services.  In the long run, the contextual part of the communication may thus become  extended to cover the entire duration of the interactive part, as illustrated on the  diagram below.   Basic Forces   cid:78  13  ABSTRACTION  TOPICS  INTERACTIVE PORTION  CONTEXTUAL PORTION  TIME  Figure 1.4 Structure of a communication session.  For  a  single,  mainstream  communication  means  to  be  successful,  it  should  today probably always be conceived as a contextual part followed by an interactive  part.  If not, the missing portion will have to be added as a bolt-on feature and this   can never be as successful as incorporating it in the original design.  1.6 Device, Connectivity, and Service Both true communication and stored media transfer involve consumers purchasing  more or less tightly packaged oﬀers including a device  e.g., a pocket PC , some  connectivity  e.g., WiFi and DSL for Internet access  and some services: e-mail,  Web  browsing,  instant  messaging,  search  engines,  VoIP  just  to  name  the  most  popular on the Internet. These three components can, together, be considered to  form a “communication means.”  As we will see in Chapter 6, developing and delivering an actual service to the  end user involves much more than writing the software application and installing  it on some server. Without entering into details here, a “service” can best be consid- ered as an “application” surrounded by “enablers.”  Is the consumer really in the driving seat to select the three components of a   communication means?   14  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Stage 1  1.6.1 In the 1980s and early 1990s, most decisions would have been made by the — then  tightly coupled — connectivity and service provider, by the equipment manufac- turer or by some corporate IT department.  The engineers in there would have made decisions on signaling standards in  access and core networks, but also on “approved” end user devices  e.g., ﬁxed ana- logue and digital phones, private branch exchanges, telematic terminals .  1.6.2 Stage 2 In the late 1990s, with the mass adoption of digital cellular communications, the  communication consumer gained power through the mobile device manufacturers:  no new network technology  i.e., connectivity or service  would become successful  if it wasn’t spreading down quickly enough from high-end devices to the lower end.  A few examples were SMS, WAP, GPRS, CDMA2000, UMTS, CMDA1X, and  MMS.  The joint selling and cross-subsidies between connectivity and device lead to  strange technical solutions such as CDMA TDMA phones without SIM, locking  in the consumer to a given CDMA TDMA connectivity provider. On GSM side,  phones were programmed to lock in the SIM, forcing to use the connectivity pro- vider which had subsidized the phone.  The joint selling of connectivity and service was also a common practice, result- ing in 50 50 deals for premium SMS services, “walled gardens” for mobile data and  a ﬂourishing ring tone market. Service A could exclusively be used through con- nectivity A, and service B only through connectivity B.  This second period ended in a fragmented market of dozens of “communica- tion silos”  tightly coupled device connectivity service combinations , with no new  communication means really emerging — most people continued to only talk and  text. Seen from a distance, the chance that mobile service providers would have  succeeded to combine the killer device  O2s XDA?  with the killer connectivity   UMTS with roaming?  and the killer service  a music store?  was thin.  1.6.3 Stage 3 With the advent of Internet connectivity and more open operating systems in the  early 2000s, even if the actual use of IP services on mobile devices is still in its  infancy in 2006, a third period has started, in which the markets for devices, con- nectivity and services started to diverge.  The mobile device consumer’s attention shifted from communication technol- ogies to “local” functions such as cameras, storage cards and local connectivity   Bluetooth, WiFi . According to the Mobile Life Report 2006 by The Carphone    Basic Forces   cid:78  15  Warehouse, price comes second. Third are style factors: form factor  e.g., clam shell,  slidephone, PDA , weight, design, and brand image.  The  consumer  of  mobile  connectivity  lost  attention  for  the  complex  tariﬀ  plans of mobile service providers, but was attracted by practical services such as  new prepaid top-up methods, Web-based prepaid  oﬀered by MVNOs — Mobile  Virtual Network Operators , or single-stop shopping for communications, Internet,  and TV.  The  “Full  MVNO”  trend,  where  independent  organizations  operate  their  own  HLRs and prepaid platforms, is a perfect illustration of how services can be split oﬀ from  connectivity. Of course both layers continue to communicate in real time to control the  routing and duration of calls, sessions, messages, and hopefully one day which media  are allowed and what QoS is applied  we’ll discuss that further in Section 3.3.2 .  In such an environment, the choice of services can and will thus still be made  later. Televoting, gaming, navigation, music download, community services and  telemetry will not necessarily come from your current mobile and Internet con- nectivity providers.  Evolution  1.6.4 The cellular communications industry isn’t quite there yet, but a similar evolution took  place in the personal computing and Internet space, around 15 years earlier.  Since the early 1990s, the markets for computing devices, Internet connectivity   and services evolve completely independently.  Specialized  form  factors   e.g.,  laptop,  pocket  PC,  cube,  server  blade,  set-top   box  and designs appeared on the device market.  Connectivity  technologies  evolved  from  dial-up  to  digital  subscriber  lines,   cable, wireless and soon mobile.  The services market is probably also 10 years ahead of what we see in the cellular  space, where the usage of search engines for example, is marginal. The usage of Web- based address books is nil from cellular devices  people use the local address book  in the SIM and or the phone . But it is substantial in the PC Internet world — for  example, with free services such as Plaxo and LinkedIn.  New  communication  means  should  be  developed  and  positioned  either  as  a  device feature, or as a connectivity mode, or as a service. It won’t be possible to  bundle the three aspects anymore.  1.7 Cellular, Mobile, and Wireless In an ideal world, the service plane would be completely decoupled from the con- nectivity plane; therefore we wouldn’t need to consider these connectivity proper- ties when discussing services.   16  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  But the possible usage patterns of services are today strongly inﬂuenced by the   degree to which this connectivity is cellular, mobile or wireless.  A good example is the current situation within IEEE* LAN MAN Standards  Committee  LMSC , where three competing long-range broadband wireless access  systems  have  been  standardized:  802.16-2004   Wireless  MAN,  “WiMAX” ,  802.16e-2005   “Mobile  WiMAX,”  February  2006   and  802.20   “Mobile-Fi” .  These three connectivity technologies can be diﬀerentiated by their degree of mobil- ity  handover speed  and degree of being wireless  the range , among other impor- tant factors such as throughput per cell and spectral eﬃciency  i.e., bit s Hz .  By the way, it must be said that in the most recent simulations,1 Mobile WiMAX,  based on an OFDM air interface, achieves remarkable results in comparison to CDMA- based 3GPP HSPA and 3GPP2 EVDO. For the ﬁrst time, for example, Mobile WiMAX  will break the magic line of 1 bit s per Hz and achieve downlink throughputs of 6 to 14  Mbit s per cell  compared to 4 Mbit s for HSPA and EVDO .  Of course, some nontechnical considerations will come into play as well  econom- ics, politics . Mobile-Fi is technically better suitable for mobile VoIP  faster handover,  lower latency , but more 3G-threatening due to its low frequency bands below 3.1GHz.  And anyway, the actual implementation of Mobile-Fi would be further ahead, as Mobile  WiMAX development is now almost completed. Therefore, the IEEE Standards Author- ity just decided to freeze the Mobile-Fi work for a few months.  1.7.1 Cellular In a cellular network, small groups of devices share a single local resource  antenna,  base station  based on their current geographic location.  IEEE Mobile WiMAX, 3GPP, and 3GPP2 are of course standardized cel-  lular networks.  But cellular networks, in our opinion, are not necessarily wireless: a LAN  can perfectly be considered to be a cell, with the IEEE 802.3 hub as the shared  resource.  Even a Virtual LAN  VLAN , spanning multiple physical locations and using the   IEEE 802.1Q-1998 tagging protocol, but no IP routing, can be considered to be a cell. Examples of noncellular networks are DSL and cable networks, in which a ded- icated resource  copper wire, coax cable  is used to connect the end device  modem   to the core network  DSLAM, CMTS .  1.7.2 Mobile In a mobile network, devices users have the rights to roam across multiple geographic  locations within a same city, same country, across countries and — increasingly —  across diﬀerent networks, technologies and devices. Coming back to the example   *  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.   Basic Forces   cid:78  17  of the enterprise network, such network will often oﬀer a degree of mobility  I can  plug in my laptop in any meeting room .  Handover is the process of keeping communications active across the boundaries  of cells, regions and technologies. Handover needs to happen fast for a technology  really to be considered mobile; for example, Mobile WiMAX will allow handover at  vehicle speeds up to 120 km h and Mobile-Fi up to 250 km h.  If a technology uses more widely available frequency bands, such as Mobile-Fi com- pared to Mobile WiMAX, it can also be considered to be more mobile, as it has the  potential to be deployed in more countries. Mobile WiMAX has been deﬁned to work in  ﬁve distinct frequency bands  “Release-1 System Proﬁles”  between 2.3 and 3.8 GHz.  Let’s note that some cellular networks are nonmobile: CDMA cellular technol- ogy is currently used in India to connect Public Central Oﬃces  PCO, ﬁxed phone  shops  in rural areas. But speciﬁc software in the network will prevent such PCO  devices to be moved to the next village.  Finally, some mobile networks are noncellular: digital video broadcasting by   satellite  DVB-S and DVB-S2 , for example.  1.7.3 Wireless In a wireless network, the physical communication takes place over the ether.  Most networks today are wired. Even in a modern cellular mobile network, a   call or message uses wires for more than 99% of the distance.  The  general  technology  trend  is  even  to  lower  the  range  which  the  wireless  devices have to bridge  the wireless reach . Cells can then accommodate more users  or  deliver  more  throughput  per  user,  fewer  transmission  errors,  and  less  power  consumption.  Health considerations and the use of unlicensed frequency bands will also force   us to reduce power and wireless reach.  In this sense, the degree to which networks can be considered to be “wireless”   is decreasing.  In developing countries, the demand for wireless access will be stronger due to   the relative scarcity of copper wires, coax cables and ﬁber glass.  Trends  1.7.4 More than the need to remove a popular confusion between these three aspects  of modern communication, it is important to be able to position communication  technologies along these three axes and to notice trends.  Technologies  which  used  to  cover  the  three  aspects   e.g.,  UMTS   may  be  attacked by cocktails of more “specialized” technologies  e.g., DSL  cid:11  WiFi  cid:11  Mobile  IP . DSL technology does not need to consider cellular aspects, WiFi standards are  not polluted by mobility, and Mobile IP does not worry about cellular or wireless.   18  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Figure 1.5 Cellular mobile wireless networks can fence you in!  Typical mobile procedures such as in-call handover may leave the realm of stan- dardized technology. To perform good in-call WiFi-to-GSM handover may not  require a new 3GPP standard, but may require ﬁne real-time analysis of the voice  quality, for example.  Is there a trend toward more cellular technologies such as HSPA, against non- cellular such as VDSL? No. IP rules the world, and uses whatever underlying tech- nology to get to the end user.  Is there a need for more mobility? Or have GSM and CDMA fully satisﬁed our  demand? Well, new demand for mobility could for example come from in-vehicle devices  such as car entertainment systems, the on-board computer or the alarm system.  Are we going more wireless? For sure, there’s a demand for broadband wireless  Internet access in emerging markets, but also covering cities, trains, petrol stations  and holiday resorts.  Presence and Availability  1.8 Timeliness,  expectation  and  unpredictability  are  the  cornerstones  of  genuine  communications.  However, these three aspects can create an “on call” atmosphere in which com- munication users feel forced to be reachable within the shortest possible time at  unpredictable moments and in inconvenient situations.  As a reaction, they might start shutting down their mobile phones, mobile e- mail clients and computers for too long, and might  probably after a few bad expe- riences  develop a sentiment of anxiety to miss an important communication or  piece of information — either good or bad news.   Basic Forces   cid:78  19  In the end, the user may feel unsatisﬁed both when the communications device  is  on  and  oﬀ  —  something  all  telecommunications  and  information  providers  should of course try and avoid at all cost.  To counter-balance the sentiment of intrusiveness, the root cause of the trouble,  modern communication means should be able to track and take into account the pres- ence, availability and preference of the user on the receiving end.  Presence was largely ignored by the Plain Old Telephone System  POTS ; it was  impossible for the receiving user to publish his her presence, namely to signal that  he she was or wasn’t physically in the neighborhood of the black phone. Hence the  caller simply had to try and wait for someone to pick up the horn.  Answering  machines  and  Interactive  Voice  Response   IVR   systems  started  taking calls in the 1970s, and people would have them switched on even when they  would be around — either at home or in the enterprise. This may be interpreted  as an expression of protective attitude against intrusiveness  you could delete these  unwanted messages, ﬁlter out callers not having a customer number, etc. , but also  the  attractiveness  of  deferred  communication   the  messages  could  be  answered  later . We’ll address immediate vs. deferred communication in Section 1.9.  Basic presence is suﬃciently addressed by existing mobile cellular networks, and  this convenience has most certainly contributed to their success. Mobile phones  may be switched oﬀ, set to vibrate and to silent mode. The mobile network can  forward incoming calls in case the called person is unreachable, busy, or doesn’t  answer the call. The phone’s on oﬀ status is known by the network, but once the  handset is powered on, the decision to answer the call can still be made based by  the called user  based on who’s calling: Calling Line ID Presentation .  Fixed enterprise telephony solutions  Private Branch eXchanges, but increasingly  Centrex and VoIP Centrex  oﬀer advanced incoming call handling. Automated or  human  attendants  can  limit  the  intrusiveness.  Increasingly,  these  attendants  are  able to take into account of calendar information  appointments, meetings, holi- days . Call centers are the school example of the practical use of presence and avail- ability information to handle inbound calls.  Company e-mail servers allow you can set an automatic reply message, when on  holidays. Web-based e-mail servers usually don’t. On the other hand, as with your  letter box, your e-mail server can’t refuse to take an incoming e-mail. Therefore,  lists of senders and keywords can be set up to ﬁlter junk e-mail. The IETF devel- oped an e-mail ﬁltering language called Sieve  RFC 3028 .  Instant Messaging programs oﬀer a good view on the presence and availability  of buddies in a buddy list, but then again not on their presence on other devices   mobile phone, gaming console, IPTV set-top box .  The availability of the user is sometimes discovered by the device itself — for  example, the availability is set to “Away” when the keyboard and mouse are not  touched for a while.  Some IM programs now allow logging in as invisible, which shows that peo- ple are maybe not that willing to show their actual presence anymore. Could the    20  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  solution  be  to  publish  diﬀerent  presence  and  availability  to  diﬀerent  groups  of  buddies?  Other communication means have until now remained presence-, availability-  and preference-agnostic: SMS, for example, does not allow the sender to see the  destination’s presence in advance of sending the message.  On the inbound side, SMS does not allow you to set an autoreply, to forward   inbound SMSs to another terminal, or to bar messages from some sources.  Are presence and availability going to spice up existing communication means?   They could, for example in the case of SMS, or even the POTS.  If your PC detects keystrokes or mouse movements, this could be communi- cated to a presence server in the POTS, assuming that your telephone is on your  desk next to your PC. Callers could then hear that you are away, if you didn’t use  your PC for say 10 minutes.  Conversely, if the upgraded, presence-aware ﬁxed telephony network detects  that you make or receive a call, it might be conﬁgured to inform your IM provider,  so your IM contacts can now see that you are “at work.”  Or are presence and availability going to enable completely new communica-  tion means?  For sure, presence and availability information would pave the way for “push” ser- vices. Today, most content and services are consulted in “pull” mode, in which the end  user has to take the initiative. If the user could let his her presence and availability be  notiﬁed to a selected set of applications, these applications could send “fresh,” relevant  content, rather than continuously pushing down needless streams of information that  are going to remain unread in some Inbox. This notify-and-push principle exists in an  embryonic format on the Internet, as “syndication”  even though today the RSS Web  feeds — Really Simple Syndication — are in fact a pull technology .  Selectiveness and trust are essential; users would be reluctant to let their pres- ence information be notiﬁed to all contacts, tribes and applications, for unknown   worse:  undesired   communications  and  content  to  be  pushed  down.  Similarly,  today people are  rightfully!  increasingly reluctant to provide their contact details   e-mail addresses and telephone numbers .  Obviously this sector will mature, and the presence and availability of informa- tion may be merged into a larger functional entity such as personal homepages,  Web-based address books or social networks.  Communication service providers should consider presence and availability as  one of the healthy ingredients in the cooking recipe for any new communication  service.  They should inspire the conﬁdence that the users will always be able to do the   following:  Grant and revoke permissions to their personal contacts, tribes, and appli-  cations to watch their own presence   Basic Forces   cid:78  21  Make sure that their own presence data will never be watched nor modiﬁed   by nonauthorized individuals and applications  Handle incoming communication based on their presence and availabil-  ity data  1.9 Immediate and Deferred Communications Maybe as a consequence of the protective measures against intrusiveness, commu- nication users have discovered the beneﬁts of deferred communications.  We saw that timeliness is essential for genuine communication to take place: a   short time span between the production and the reception of information.  When it used to be humans receiving the information, machines  e.g., answer- ing machines, IVR systems, voicemail systems, e-mail clients, SMS MMS-enabled  mobile phones  are now receiving these calls and messages. Humans now have the  comfort to read, interpret and react on them later.  Communication is deferred, and sometimes buried among stored information   requiring no action.  Has it therefore become less “genuine”? To some extent, yes. In large companies, there’s today a noticeable erosion of  the value of an e-mail, for example. Senior executives and their assistants receive,  skip, archive, interpret and send hundreds of e-mails a day. A certain error rate is  accepted by the originators. The expected time of reaction is, after having gone  down since the adoption of e-mail and mobility, increasing again. Senders “esca- late” by using multiple communication means, which is worsening the problems.  How many voicemails start with “Hey I sent you an e-mail,” and vice versa?  Are  users  expecting  their  communication  service  providers  to  play  a  role  in  improving things, by sending reminders for pending messages or actions? Perhaps,  if these notiﬁcations could be limited and aggregated  providing a daily summary  instead of a continuous stream .  Perhaps someone could also suggest priorities to all these messages, by learning from   the priorities we assigned ourselves, our past reaction time to that sender, and so on.  As for most basic forces structuring modern communications, value-added ser- vices relying on them will become more successful if they can be provided spanning  multiple communication means. Today this is not the case; you would be notiﬁed  by your cell phone, your instant messenger, your online game, and so forth.  The idea of the communication service provider as a personal Inbound Com-  munications Handler  ICH  will come back throughout this book.  In  the  meanwhile,  our  pending  and  archived  communications  are  stored  in giant data centers around the world, for example, in the order of 3 PB* for   *  A petabyte  cid:29  more than 1015 bytes  cid:29  more than a million billion bytes.   22  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  a 50,000-person company, or 60 GB cid:10  per employee. Across all communication  means, world demand could be estimated to be in the order of 5 EB† today.‡  Further demand could arise from storing media in these data centers; that is, if  people would be allowed to leave all their e-mails and attachments on the servers, or  if video would start prevailing over voice communication, we would be on a steep  curve to the ZB.§  Whereas this calls for advances in database technology and economies of scale,  a second aspect are the networks to access all these messages. Broadband connec- tivity providers are perhaps not connecting users to other users, but users to their  message library.  The evolution to deferred communications could end up in a world where mes- sages  and  multimedia  content  are  stored  and  universally  accessible,  and  people  communicate in terms of “links”  pointers  to stored content. A world where know- ing how and where to ﬁnd the info is a more precious skill than knowing much or  producing much new information.  In that sense it would be useful for people to be able to talk about these pointers;  for communication service providers to invent and promote extensions to language.  Universal Resource Locators  URL  are obviously not appropriate.  After all, haven’t SMS and IM users invented their own “pointers” to longer   expressions?  1.10 On-Demand, Triggered, and Periodic The  circumstances  in  which  communications  are  launched   originated   have  an  increasing inﬂuence on their frequency.  It’s a pretty vague statement, so let’s pick an example. Newspapers, for example, are available in three modes: on demand at a news- paper  outlet,  triggered  by  events  such  as  major  catastrophes,  or  periodically,  in  subscription mode.  On-demand communications require repeated purchase decisions by the end  user, therefore limiting commercial success in the long term, certainly in a world  where communication means are abundant and compete with each other. Their  beneﬁt, on the other hand, is that they look less obtrusive.  * A gigabyte  cid:29  more than 109 bytes  cid:29  more than a billion bytes. † An exabyte  cid:29  more than 1018 bytes  cid:29  more than a billion billion bytes. ‡ According to a September 2006 report of industry analyst IDC, shipped storage capacity grew  to 704 PB in the second quarter of 2006, representing 51.5% year-on-year growth. With an  average system lifetime of 12 quarters, total installed capacity should be at around 7 times that  number  4  cid:11  2  cid:11  1 . §  A zettabyte  cid:29  more than 1021 bytes.   Basic Forces   cid:78  23  Triggered communications are a relative novelty. SMS, e-mail, IM and RSS are  examples where the communication is accomplished when the recipient user “sur- faces”  powers on the device or launches a program . Diﬀerent events could be imag- ined to trigger such communications, from world news, over stock quote changes, a  car accident, to a particular location or mood of the recipient user. The possibilities  of such communication means are yet to be explored fully. What is their degree of  perceived obtrusiveness in the long term?  Periodic communications are probably the most obtrusive, if established between  humans. Even if touted as more acceptable between machines  e.g., for telemetry ,  cost-conscious communication consumers  i.e., of mobile data megabits  are look- ing for less “chatty” applications. Consumers may end up feeling trapped in a sys- tem they subscribed to, with no possibility to cancel. The periodic mode is probably  more suitable for the transfer of stored information, than for true communication  services. Online gaming providers who impose to their end users to be online at  certain times of the week could soon discover the negative eﬀects of periodicity.  When conceiving new communication means, the on-demand, triggered and   periodic aspects need to be evaluated in great detail.  The role of the communication service providers could be expanded from grant- ing permissions for on-demand services today  calls being made thanks to an exist- ing billing relationship or prepaid account  to storing all information regarding  triggers and subscriptions to communication and information services, tomorrow. It is just another weapon in the battle against the growing commoditization of   connectivity, communication and information.  1.11  Contact Lists and Tribes During the course of their social lives, individuals build personal contact lists which  are today maintained on mobile phones, on PCs, and on the Internet.  According to the Mobile Life Report 2006 by The Carphone Warehouse, mobile  phones have allowed us “to return to the more natural and humane communication  patterns of preindustrial society, when we lived in small, stable communities and  enjoyed frequent communication with a tightly integrated social network of family,  neighbours and friends.”  The  report  further  ﬁnds  six  socio-demographic  segments  which  it  labels  as  “Tribes”  Generation Mobile, Phonatics, Practical Parents, Smart Connected, Fin- ger and Thumbs and Silver Cynics . These are, however, merely market segments:  though these people must certainly have a common usage pattern of mobile phones,  they don’t necessarily communicate more with people within the same segment.  Also, it is diﬃcult to say whether or not these segments are also applicable to diﬀer- ent communication means such as instant messaging.  Through  our  social  life  we  become  members  of  schools,  companies,  sports  clubs, interest groups, political parties and unions — “real” organizations. In the    24  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Internet  era,  we  subscribe  to  newsletters,  use  Web  applications   banking ,  cre- ate Web passports and log in to various machines and applications, and become  members of Web communities. The distinction between the former organizations  and the new “electronic organizations” is getting more blurred every day. A generic  name for these groups of users could be “tribes.”  The ability to maintain these contacts and tribe memberships has become an  important aspect of everyday life; who would like to lose his her personal login  passwords ﬁle without having a backup? Who has never experienced the frustration  of transferring the contacts list from an old to a new mobile phone? Or to log in to  your company’s Web mail portal and discover that you can’t send e-mails because  your contacts are not in there?  1.11.1 Contact lists The  Internet  Mail  Consortium’s  standard  vCard  format  is  an  XML  document  allowing storage of a personal contact’s e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, home  pages and geographic address. It allows the PC’s address book to be synchronized  with most mobile devices.  As  for  presence  and  availability,  one  can  wonder  whether  this  information   belongs only within devices or also within the network.  Plaxo, for example, oﬀers individuals the opportunity to copy personal contacts   to a Web application, and to keep them synchronized.  Web-based e-mail programs rely entirely on Web-based contact lists. People however are not ready for a Web-only contacts list: synchronization can  be a tedious task, but it should remain possible to watch the contacts without hav- ing network access.  1.11.2 Tribe Memberships How about the tribe memberships?  Let’s here consider a tribe from the strict communications sense: the list of users   Today the tribe’s own member list is maintained in  hopefully a set of redun-  of a given service.  dant  servers.  Tribe members themselves have their own schemes  from text ﬁles to spread- sheets   to  maintain  their  personal  list  of  memberships.  There  are  no  standards   yet?  to store and synchronize this information between the tribe and the member.  Higher security services such as Web banking now even require additional physical  signature devices.  Without local address books, people would make fewer outgoing calls and send   fewer text messages from mobile phones.  Would it therefore be a fair explanation of today’s low success of mobile data  services, that there’s simply no tribe membership ﬁle on today’s mobile handsets?    Basic Forces   cid:78  25  That there’s no “single sign-on” procedure to the services, except maybe to the ser- vices in the walled garden of the connectivity service provider?  If these contact lists and tribe memberships are well thought of, it should be   possible to organize them in the following ways:  With multiple identities: I may be identiﬁed by application X as a company,   and by application Y as an individual.  With multiple proﬁles: I may not wish to reveal my personal vCard in a   professional context, and vice versa.  By category: it is diﬃcult on today’s phones to organize contacts in various  categories  e.g., family, friends, colleagues, recently used , and to keep  that organization while synchronizing.  With extensible attributes: it should be possible to add future contact details   through new communication means  e.g., the SIP address .  Relationally: it should be possible to jump from contact to contact, along  relationships representing the real structure of our social networks  e.g.,  brother, employer, coach of .  With two-way handshaking: when contact B is added in person A’s address  book, it should be possible to invite person B to add contact A in person  B’s own address book.  1.11.3 Evolution As in the case of presence and availability, various industry players are going to  ﬁght to hold contact lists  historically the domain of mobile phone manufacturers  and e-mail client producers  and tribe memberships  e.g., for the production and  distribution of security certiﬁcates .  Maybe a new industry will emerge. Alternatively, contact lists and tribes will migrate from the domain of e-mail  and telecommunications into the realm of various industries related to authentica- tion, security, identity management and electronic purses.  1.12  Location Much  has  been  said  about  location  and  its  beneﬁts,  for  example  the  possibility  to  adapt  content,  tariﬀs  or  incoming  call  handling  based  on  the  user’s  current  location.  The mobile communications industry has tried to assess which granularity of  location information would be required for which services. For sure, navigation  requires  the  granularity  of  GPS.  But  could  so-called  home oﬃce  zone  services   lower tariﬀs  be provided based on the GSM cell ID, in an attempt to displace the  landlines?   26  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Would people be willing to pay a premium to ﬁnd the nearest pizza restaurant  in Paris  an iconic example at GSM congress presentations , rather than just asking  someone?  Some people started to think about location-based services  in mobile networks   as a remedy to poor user input interface on the terminal  small display : “the mobile  device would automatically display the map of where I am.” OK, but that’s precisely  what a GPS navigation system does.  Or as input data for push services: “walk into the shopping center and receive a   targeted advertisement,” another example in the same series.  A few niche services have been launched, but in general, location based services   have not delivered on the promise.  Worse, the market is so immature that an Italian operator saw a sudden decrease  of subscriber numbers once their current location became available on the Internet,  even if previous permissions had to be granted by the mobile subscriber. People did  not even want to enter the debate on whether they would grant the viewing permis- sions or not; they simply cancelled their subscription to get rid of the problem.  In the recipe of a new communication service, I would therefore qualify loca- tion as the garlic: excellent for health, deterring to many, and always to be used in  extreme moderation.   Chapter 2 A SWOT Analysis  for Communication  Service Providers  In this chapter, let’s land our chopper on the grounds of the Communication Service  Providers  CSP : Fixed and Mobile Operators, including new entrants such as Quad  Play* Service Providers, Instant Messaging and VoIP Service Providers, and Web- based Mobile Virtual Network Operators  MVNO .  Let’s consider their assets in terms of strengths and weaknesses, and the oppor-  tunities and threats oﬀered by the immediate surroundings of our landing spot.  2.1 Strengths Today, Mobile and Fixed Operators have highly valuable assets.  GSM CDMA cellular radio coverage and copper lines have both proven to be  able to carry IP traﬃc in always-on mode, using GPRS, CDMA2000 and DSL tech- nologies. The bandwidth is suﬃcient for many services, and can still be increased,  at the cost of huge investments though  3G on the mobile side, VDSL on the ﬁxed  side . This should enable streaming services such as digital radio, digital TV and  video calls to be carried over these packet networks — services which put quite  stringent requirements on the underlying bit pipes in terms of Quality of Service:   *  Simultaneously providing ﬁxed, mobile telecom, Internet access and digital TV.  27   28  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  high availability, throughput, latency, jitter and error rate. This transport Quality- of-Service is diﬃcult to oﬀer on copper pairs you don’t own, or using unlicensed  frequencies.  In the ﬁxed network, the unbundling of the local loop has allowed Internet Ser- vice Providers  ISPs  to oﬀer broadband Internet access to the residential and business  communities. But the last mile of copper has remained the property of the telephone  company.  Second,  Mobile  and  Fixed  operators  share  the  valuable  asset  of  the  E.164  addressing space, and, related to this, the existing commercial customer relation- ships for postpaid or prepaid telephony. New NGNSPs could be tempted to invent  a new address space  personal nicknames, e-mail addresses, etc  which do not allow  valuable  inbound  calls  and  messages   i.e.,  no  inter-operator  accounting .  If  they  want to use E.164 numbers, these NGNSPs could have to crawl to painful issues  such as licenses, interconnections and number portability — the key skills of Mobile  and Fixed operators.  Mobile and Fixed Operators have proven to be able to market messaging  services on a per-message basis  SMS and MMS; person-to-person, person-to- application and application-to-person  — as opposed to ISPs and new NGNSPs, which  have to let instant messaging services be used for free  at least to the end user .  Last but not least, Mobile and Fixed Operators have gained great in-house expe- rience with the core network aspects of IP technology  e.g., addressing, routing,  QoS, security  and packetization in general  e.g., WAP, GPRS, MMS  — maybe as  opposed to ISPs, who have concentrated on providing higher-level services on top  of basic Internet access  e.g., Web design ad hosting, e-mail, DNS .  2.2 Weaknesses Most Mobile and Fixed Operators face some internal structural weaknesses, when  attacking the market of new NGN services.  Two rating and account management systems are still in place: typically an  online IN-based system for prepaid subscribers and an oﬀ-line billing system for  postpaid  subscribers,  inter-operator  accounting,  and  many  more  functions.  Few  Operators have gone through the organizational and technical process to rational- ize this situation.  At Mobile Operators, Value-Added Services  e.g., voicemail, SMS, WAP, MMS,  Prepaid, VPN, PoC  have been deployed as vertically integrated stove-pipe appli- cations, each with their own network interfaces, databases, provisioning, billing,  supervision and CRM mechanisms. The intricate Web of cross-vendor intercon- nections is now becoming an impediment to launch any new application in such  an environment.  Whereas many Mobile Operators now belong to supranational groups, impor- tant processes such as purchasing, engineering and operations have shown to be  too diﬃcult to centralize  or to distribute to specialized centers . NGN technology    A SWOT Analysis for Communication Service Providers   cid:78  29  clearly  has  the  potential  to  be  deployed  at  supranational  level,  but  the  lack  of  technical group strategy could hamper such deployments.  Finally, the lack of collaboration between Mobile and Fixed operators is a  handicap, when facing NGN service providers, for which the distinction between  mobile and ﬁxed are just access methods  i.e., a diﬀerent version of their SIP user  agent software . Fixed-Mobile Convergence  FMC  is the key objective of the IP  Multimedia Subsystem, but will the Operators be able to introduce the correspond- ing organizational changes?  2.3 Opportunities This being said, NGN technology will open a series of opportunities for Mobile  and Fixed Operators.  Quad play  the joint sale of ﬁxed and mobile telephony, Internet access and  broadcasting  should allow increasing revenues, even though NGN technology is  not a prerequisite to realize it. Introducing NGN technology is just an additional  opportunity to streamline the oﬀer in these three domains  e.g., to oﬀer one pre- paid account or one bill .  Virtual Operators  low-cost, Web-based, prepaid, targeted at a niche segment   is a new way to market telecom services under various brands. Any new NGN service  platform should be conceived to be shared by multiple service providers.  The great commercial uptake and natural attraction of residential broadband  Internet access is a great opportunity for Fixed Operators in general. Adding a NGN  and VAS layer on top should enable them to move further up the value chain. For example, instant messaging users are accustomed to the convenience of avail- ability  e.g., Away, Busy, Appear Oﬄine . In the next future, they will demand  subscription-based  and  push-type  telecom  services  that  take  into  account  their  willingness, activities, preferred communication types and devices, calling buddies,  location, agenda, time zone, mood, and so on. This personal policy should be stored  in an open environment shared by multiple services, companies and even indus- tries. Personal contact pages will entertain and inform the caller with personalized  ring-back tones, pictures and animations, selected by the called party.  NGN  technology  should  also  allow  the  Operators  to  reverse  the  business  model for some services. We will look at this in further detail in this book  i.e., in  Sections 4.8 and 5.6 , but the general idea is that not all revenue should come from  the end user of the VAS.  Further specialization by layer  e.g., into Access, NGN Core, VAS and IT cost  centers  is an opportunity for Mobile and Fixed operators to fundamentally reduce  the cost to serve. A commercial alliance of WiMAX access provider, NGN core  service provider and MVNO makes perfect sense, but each of them needs to focus  on their core competencies and be proﬁtable at a larger scale. A single company  will fail.   30  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  These NGN, VAS and IT service providers may choose to ensure service con- tinuity across legacy  POTS, GSM  and new  NGN, IMS  Access networks. An  example  of  this  is  presence-based  routing  of  inbound  communications,  which  could also take into account the presence events on POTS side — for example, an  incoming telephone call currently being answered.  Finally, it is generally expected that NGN VoIP technology will be the trigger  for  corporate  organizations  to  outsource  their  internal  communication  services  to networked PBX  “IP Centrex”  operators, which the ﬁxed line operators  with  experience in Centrex  are deﬁnitely well placed to become.  2.4 Threats High-quality peer-to-peer services  e.g., for instant messaging, address books, ﬁle  sharing, telephony, video telephony  today threaten the concept itself of a Network  Operator. Residential broadband access seems to have been Pandora’s Box and the  results are unpredictable for the telecom industry as a whole.  With the phenomenal uptake of broadband IP in the home,* the broadcasting  industry  based on coaxial cable  and telecommunication providers  with DSL on  copper pairs  are engaged in a ﬁerce battle for market share. Seen from the other side,  the entertainment industry  including TV, movies, music, sports, and so on  now  has a new do-it-all channel to the end user, called IPTV†. But will entertainment  mainly ﬂow through IPTV, or just over IP? The variety of content and richness of  user experience on the Internet is staggering, and youth stopped watching TV.  Internet communities have huge commercial power, as they are organized by  groups of people sharing the same interests. Telco’s do not know their customers so  well  their knowledge stops at an E.164 number, a calling pattern and sometimes  a billing address . Broadcasters don’t know their customers at all  except a billing  address . Advertising revenues will therefore ﬂow more easily to a targeted audience  within these communities‡, rather than down the SMS MMS, NGN IMS or IPTV  pipe.  But also in their access networks  the last mile , Mobile and Fixed Opera- tors  will  face  competition  from  new  entrants  using  new  wireless  broadband  access  technologies   WiMAX  and  OFDM-based  in  general   over  unlicensed  spectrum. Please note that the WiMAX speciﬁcations support both unlicensed   * Over 70% of American homes will have broadband connectivity by 2009. † Though this channel is mainly oﬀered by telecom service providers  the Incumbent and Com- peting  Local  Exchange  Carriers   today,  it  is  clearly  not  a  communications  service  but  the  transmission of stored content  cf. Chapter 1 .  ‡ People searching for “Gevrey-Chambertin” can automatically be considered to be member of  the Bourgogne wine amateurs’ community, therefore the search engine will make sure that the  right sponsored links appear in the search results, and even on the target Web site.   A SWOT Analysis for Communication Service Providers   cid:78  31  spectrum  in the 5–6 GHz range  and licensed spectrum  below 11 GHz or in  the 10–66 GHz band  — we’ll review the standards in Section 3.7. Short-range  unlicensed spectrum technologies  e.g., WiMAX, WiFi, Bluetooth, Wibree  may  cause a move from Mobile  2.5G, 3G  to Fixed access  DSL, cable .  Finally, the third billion mobile users, to be connected before 2010, will yield  much lower ARPU  average revenue per user  than the ﬁrst and second one. If the  Operators do not succeed to reduce costs structurally  i.e., with all-IP networks and  converged billing systems , going after this next billion users could turn out to be  nonproﬁtable.  2.5 Conclusion Introducing SIP NGN technology will allow Mobile and Fixed Operators to miti- gate their Weaknesses and fully exploit their Strengths. But it won’t inﬂuence the  important new Opportunities or Threats that they are currently facing: these com- mercial battles have to be fought.  Multiple  industries   e.g.,  telecom,  broadcasting,  instant  messengers,  search   engines  are currently converging to the use of these consistent technologies.  Standardization is a way to create global, successful markets for these industries.  Figure 2.1 Opportunities for NGN communication services.   32  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  It creates the landscape, the battleﬁeld in which the competitors are going to   diﬀerentiate themselves with service oﬀers.  The  following  diagram  presents  the  commercial  landscape  for  connectivity,   communication and content services, in a typical, mature market.  Consumers  and  enterprises  are  willing  to  pay  for  content  and  mobility,  but  historically, competing technologies and devices had divided the market in very  distinct industries such as broadcasting and GSM.  The uniﬁed NGN technology will allow addressing new segments — literally by  undercutting most of today’s technologies and communication methods in price, but  also by providing a new customer experience across the diﬀerent terminals.  On the far left and the far right side of the diagram, communication consum- ers might be willing to give up some services, in return for the broad, horizontally  uniﬁed user experience. On the left-hand side for example, the electric power on  an analog telephone line, which guarantees emergency calling in all circumstances,  might be sacriﬁced in the NGN. On the right-hand side, consumers might be will- ing  to  sacriﬁce  the  national  coverage  of  mobile  cellular  networks,  in  return  for  higher  wireless  speed,  content  or  even  social  networking  at  well-located  digital  media kiosks.  In the next chapter let’s review the past and ongoing standardization work for  this NGN. Despite our eﬀorts to summarize, interpret and position these standards  relative to each other, we have to warn that the next chapter remains the most arid  part of this book, and contains the most acronyms.  Fasten seat belts!   Chapter 3 Review of the  Standardization Work  for Next Generation  Networks  In this chapter we take a tour through the work of the standards bodies that are  currently driving Next Generation Networks.  When a telecommunication technology is successfully standardized, it results   in a world market for devices, services and business models.  At ﬁrst sight, it may seem an arid world of acronyms, architectures, procedures   and protocols, driven by strong industrial interests.  But  people  should  try  and  form  a  personal  opinion:  not  only  engineers  and  managers at communication service providers and their equipment vendors but also  the consumers of devices, connectivity and services — a large group.  Is it still worth reviewing technology standards from the perspective of a com-  munication service provider only?  Yes, insofar as these technologies could lead to operational eﬃciencies, better  business  models  and  a  better  end  user  experience.  Yes  also  if  introducing  these  improves the SWOT-situation of the communication service providers, in general. Should businesses buy a 3G phone ﬂeet now, or wait for IEEE Mobile WiMAX   to be built into the next laptops?  Are nonstandard IM VoIP clients going to be marketed as freeware, adware, and  spyware, versus standard SIP clients under a licensed, pay-per-call, ﬂat-free model?  33   34  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Should the car industry adopt communication standards such as SIP today,  wait for new ones, or develop their own? Considering their recent  and maybe not  so successful  experience in navigation systems ….  It helps to look at the new standards from the perspective of past success for- mulas. Are the features still there  e.g., echo cancellation for voice ? Are known  issues and imitations of past technologies  e.g., long call setup delays  successfully  addressed in the new one?  Some services such as video calling were even developed throughout multiple  standards  ISDN; 3GPP Release 1999 circuit switched; SIP , which helps to form  an opinion on the beneﬁts of each standard.  Also, uncovering the main drivers behind an organization’s work one can shed   some light on the usefulness of a technology.  But before we dive into the organizations and standards in the area  in order of  relevance , it is time for some ﬁrst attempts to deﬁne a Next Generation Network.  Not too broad, not too narrow.  3.1 Deﬁnition of a Next Generation Network A Next Generation Network is a set of servers that allows User Agents to establish and be  charged for Sessions, within which they can convey Media streams.  This statement is too trivial; it’s like deﬁning the Internet as a network in which  we use HTTP to browse sites hosted on Web servers — which ignores the myriad  of other applications on IP.  Under this basic NGN deﬁnition, user agents may, once they have established  the session, exchange media streams freely, outside of the control of the Next Gen- eration Network Service Provider  NGNSP .  We will use this new acronym, NGNSP, throughout the book, in analogy with  ISP  Internet service providers  mainly providing connectivity to the Internet  but  also e-mail, hosting, name servers and other services  and CSPs  communication  service providers  providing traditional ﬁxed and mobile communication services.  For the moment, let’s park the question whether NGNSPs will ever be part of the  CSP family.  One can wonder whether a NGNSP is required, and could claim revenue, for   such simple task as setting up SIP sessions to telephone numbers at domains.  Some people have even started to think of SIP as a peer-to-peer protocol, remov-  ing the need for a NGNSP to switch  analyze and route  these addresses.  Would it help to add the following conditions to the deﬁnition? The Media streams will be forced to use a Border Gateway of the same organization  as the one charging for the Session establishment. This NGNSP will take the responsi- bility to deliver adequate Quality-of-Service, according to the codec negotiated for the  media stream.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  35  OK, this would justify the existence of a NGNSP, only if Quality-of-Service   QoS  turns out to be an issue in peer-to-peer mode and if that issue cannot be  resolved  by  just  installing  more  transmission  bandwidth  and  more  IP  routing  capacity. Peer-to-peer services are, by the way, very good at consuming a larger  portion of the available bandwidth than client-server applications  or spoke wheel  architectures .  At the heart of the discussion about whether we’ll see more NGNSPs or more  ISPs in the future lies the question of whether the NGN can eat away enough Inter- net bandwidth from peer-to-peer applications.  Today,  an  ISP  installing  additional  bandwidth  only  improves  the  quality  of   peer-to-peer services — not necessarily that of other applications.  The abilities to make outgoing communications to any destination outside of  the NGN, or to receive incoming sessions from the outside world, are also not jus- tifying the existence of a NGNSP either. Today these services are already oﬀered  to SIP users directly, by outbound VoIP carriers and inbound TDM collectors.  Sometimes these companies are not even establishing public interconnections or  operating media gateways themselves anymore.  Another  aspect  of  such  deﬁnition  is  that  it  does  not  diﬀerentiate  the  NGN  from the “Current Generation Networks” such as ISDN, the Integrated Services  Digital Network from the late 1980s  Section 3.6.1 , on which GSM networks are  also based.  The ITU-T’s ISDN could be used to set up various types of channels  speech,  fax, and circuit-switched data such as video  which could be considered as media  streams. Strong QoS was guaranteed by the fact that these media streams were con- veyed on dedicated circuits — which is why NGNSPs would deploy QoS-enabled  border gateways.  Diﬀerentiation of the NGN is possible only with an extra  architectural  condi-  tion in the deﬁnition:  Media and Border Gateways.  In an NGN, there’s an open interface between the Session Control Layer and the   But is the communication service consumer going to care? And if the session control and media gateway planes are split in the core of a  traditional GSM network — splitting up today’s MSC in an MSC server and a  media gateway — does it then become a Next Generation Network?  It could be worth examining whether diﬀerent organizations could deploy the ses- sion control layer and the media and border gateways. Probably this would lead to  economies of scale, but slow down the implementation of QoS enforcement.  In conclusion of this little deﬁnition exercise, please ﬁnd below an overall dia-  gram deﬁning the architecture of the NGN, to our best current knowledge.  This diagram should allow us to position the work of multiple standards bodies   which are active in the telecommunications ﬁeld.   36  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Figure 3.1 A layered deﬁnition of the Next Generation Network.  Under our deﬁnition, an NGN consists of ﬁve logical layers:  1. An IT and Services layer, containing the   cid:78   cid:78    cid:78   cid:78    cid:78   Telecom Management Network  TMN  for supervision Home Subscribe Server  HSS , supposed to become the master data- base and mobility manager for all subscribers in an IP Multimedia  Subsystem  IMS  Application Servers  AS , executing subscriber-dependent service logic Operations  Support  System   OSS ,  the  IT  system  for  subscribers,  product catalogs and provisioning processes Billing Support System  BSS , the charging system receiving network  information after the facts  oﬀ-line  or before the facts  online   2.The Session Control layer, conveying the necessary signaling to let end   users establish multimedia communication sessions  3.The Resource and Admission Control layer, allocating bandwidth resources  to individual media streams, and admitting or refusing users to the NGN 4.The Media and Border Gateways layer, conveying the IP packets contain- ing encoded media  voice, video , performing the necessary conversions  and enforcing the policies decided by the Resource and Admission Con- trol layer   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  37  5.The  Layer  2  Termination,  where  devices  such  as  a  Broadband  Remote  Access Server are terminating layer 2 tunnels to the customer premises  equipment  i.e., a DSL modem , but also of course using various wireless  technologies  From  a  service  provider  perspective,  this  diagram  is  also  designed  to  better  illustrate “real life” rather than only their own network: interconnections to other  service  providers,  to  enterprises,  northbound  integration,  the  competition  from  non-SIP services on the public Internet are items that do not appear in traditional  telco-space standardization diagrams.  Even though that won’t be a major point of attention in this book, IP probes  containing content ﬁlters, policy enforcers, and traﬃc metering functions will need  to be integrated in the NGNSP’s admission control and billing systems — certainly  if the NGNSP organization  the communication service provider  is also playing  the role of the ISP  Internet service provider . However, for sake of simplicity and  in order not to blur our NGN deﬁnition with non-SIP-based services, let’s not con- sider such equipment to be part of the NGN itself.  The interconnection to peer networks and applications deserves special atten- tion, due to the security risks involved. Let’s discuss that aspect later, in a dedicated  Chapter 4.  Chapter 5 will address the charging and rating requirements for communica-  tion means in the NGN.  We will take a closer look at the Service layer in Chapter 6.  3.2 IETF The Internet Engineering Task Force can be considered to be the founder of the  Next Generation Network, but, as we will see, not the author.  Its Internet, Operations and Management, Routing, Security, and Transport   Areas are laying the groundwork for a solid NGN.  More speciﬁcally, the Internet Area delivers a network layer, which can be used   for both session signaling and media transport.  The Real-Time Applications and Infrastructure Area  a confusing name  stan-  dardizes the session and media layers.  The Applications Area deals with e-mail, Web authoring, calendar sharing, and  so forth, but not speciﬁcally in relation to an underlying NGN. Therefore, we won’t  discuss its work in this book.  The IETF also created SIGTRAN  Signaling TRANsport , a set of important  standards for the reliable transport of signaling over IP networks. The stream con- trol  transmission  protocol   SCTP,  RFC  2960,  year  2000   laid  the  groundwork  to carry signaling protocols requiring the reliability of the Transmission Control Protocol  TCP, RFC 793, 1981  without its slowness in networks with packet loss.   38  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  SCTP was designed to carry adaptation layers for ITU-T SS7  see Section 3.6 .  But today, SCTP is considered as a viable alternative to UDP and TCP, in order to  carry SIP  RFC 3261 in 2002 uses UDP; RFC 4168 in 2005 proposes SCTP  but  also DIAMETER  RFC 3588 in 2003 used TCP .  3.2.1 Internet Area The Internet area puts a lot of energy into mobility management, through diﬀerent  working groups.  3.2.1.1 netlmm The  Network-Based  Localized  Mobility  Management   netlmm   working  group  is developing a two-stage mobility architecture similar from what we know from  mobile data networks  e.g., GPRS, CDMA  and from 3GPP’s IP Multimedia Sub- system  described in Section 3.3 .  Local mobility involves movements across some administratively and geograph- ically contiguous set of subnets, while global mobility involves movements across  broader administrative, geographical and topological domains.  During such movements, at least within a geographic area such as a city or  campus, the objective is to preserve the higher-layer communication  e.g., a TCP  session  by very fast handover and limited packet loss. Other objectives are low  signaling overhead.  This work is relevant in a NGN context, as very promising unlicensed access   standards  WiMAX  are about to be launched commercially.  3.2.1.2 mipshop, mip4, mip6 The  MIP  Performance,  Signaling,  and  Handoﬀ  Optimization   mipshop   work- ing group has proposed a suitable mobility architecture for low overhead as the  Hierarchical Mobile IPv6  HMIPv6 . The standard for fast handover was named  FMIPv6.  Previous work in the IETF mip4 and mip6 working groups had focused on  the mobility management protocols themselves  MIPv4 and MIPv6 , which would  allow the devices to announce their current position  real IPv4 or IPv6 address   to a mobility manager in the network. However, these protocols have not known  enough commercial success on the IP devices  wireless or wired. cellular or not .  In the cellular space for example, MIPv4 was adopted by 3GPP2 CDMA2000 but  not by 3GPP GPRS.  On the contrary, commercial WiFi switches appeared to be capable to track a  device’s mobility across a set of hot spots, without speciﬁc mobility protocols on the  device. The device keeps its allocated IP address, and the handover is performed fast  enough for advanced communication applications such as voice not to be aﬀected.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  39  So  the  IETF  netlmm  working  group  is  now  chartered  to  standardize  an   approach that has become a de facto market trend.  3.2.1.3 Other Working Groups Other  working  groups  have  addressed  the  mobility  theme.  For  example,  the  Seamoby group proposed Candidate Access Router Discovery  CARD, experimen- tal RFC 4066  and Context Transfer Protocol  CXTP, experimental RFC 4067   to speed up the handover of authentication, authorization, accounting, PPP and  header compression contexts when the Mobile Node is moving or may be moving  from one Access Router  AR  to another.  Redirecting the incoming IP packets as fast as possible to the new AR may not   be the sole goal of a mobility management solution.  Of course, the Internet Area includes multiple other working groups aiming for  the support of IP  v6 and or v4  over new physical layers such as 802.16 WiMAX,  low power Wireless Personal Access Networks  WPAN  or Digital Video Broadcast   DVB .  Tunneling, for example for remote access to enterprise intranets, also remains a   continuous point of attention.  3.2.2    Real-Time Applications and Infrastructure  Area — Media Layer  Within this area, the Audio Video Transport  AVT  working group has delivered  the cornerstone for media transport in the NGN: the Real Time Protocol  RTP,  IETF RFC 3550, which superseded RFC 1889 .  RTP implements application-level framing and integrated layer processing, as  deﬁned in David D. Clark and David L. Tennenhouse’s paper, “Architectural Con- siderations for a New Generation of Protocols,” ACM, 1990. The sequence numbers  in RTP allow the receiver to reconstruct the sender’s packet sequence, or the loca- tion of a packet in a video stream. RTP supports underlying transport layers with  possible packet loss and out-of-sequence arrival  UDP .  Embedded in RFC 3550 is the Real Time Control Protocol  RTCP , of which  the aims are to monitor the quality of service and to convey information about  the participants in an on-going session. Indeed, RTP and RTCP were designed to  make use of IP Multicast at the lower layer. Hence for example, each participant to  an audio conference will periodically multicast a reception report plus the name of  its user on the RTCP control port.  RFC 3550 also introduces two important RTP relay nodes: mixers and translators.  Mixers are able to convert media  RTP packets  from multiple sources into a new out- going RTP stream, with its own timing. Translators are able to receive multicast RTP  packets and send out unicast RTP, for example, to go through a company ﬁrewall.   40  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  RFC 3550 is not a ﬁnal protocol speciﬁcation and makes no assumption about  the media stream being conveyed; for each new media type, RFC 3550 needs to be  completed with two companion documents:   cid:78   cid:78   “RTP Proﬁle”: the RFC 3551 for audio and video. “RTP Payload Format”: how, for example, H.261-encoded video is carried  in an RTP packet.  RTCP was extended in 2003 with the eXtended Report  XR  message  RFC 3611 ,  allowing intermediates and end users to discover new objective metrics for media qual- ity: packet loss and discard, burst, delay, Mean Opinion Scores, and so on.  3.2.3    Real-Time Applications and Infrastructure  Area — Session Control Layer  3.2.3.1 mmusic Here we enter the work of the Multiparty Multimedia Session Control  mmusic   working group. I would consider them to be the inventors of IP television.  The Real Time Streaming Protocol  RTSP, IETF RFC 2326, 1998  is sometimes  described as “the VCR remote control of multimedia networks.” Very similar to  HTTP, this protocol allows participants to setup, play, pause and teardown media  streams within a session. It is used by the major video players today  RealPlayer,  Windows Media Player and Quicktime . The group drafted RTSP 2.0, known as  RFC 2326bis, and which can be regarded as a correction of RTSP 1.0.  Immediately next, mmusic catered for a way to describe the media present in a  streaming session — the Session Description Protocol  SDP, RFC 2327  and the  way these media can be negotiated during session establishment, using an oﬀer  answer model  RFC 3264 . In 2006, RFC 2327 was superseded by RFC 4566.  Next, mmusic is preparing a way for clients to announce not only their media  capabilities, but also their capabilities to negotiate the media which will be used in  a session.  Mmusic is also chartered to deliver an Internet Media Guide  IMG : a collection   of multimedia session descriptions, comparable to a television program guide.  3.2.3.2 SIP SIPPING This brings us to the work of the Session Initiation Protocol  SIP  working group, in  fact a spin-oﬀ from mmusic, and the SIP Investigation  SIPPING  working group,  which considers new services and feeds requirements into sip.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  41  IETF’s cornerstone speciﬁcation in the session control layer is the Session Initia- tion Protocol  SIP, RFC 3261 , complemented with a procedural RFC on how to  extend it  RFC 3427 .  SIP is built on a comparable syntax to HTTP, SMTP, RTSP and other IETF   signaling protocols.  Whereas RTSP’s primary focus was to set up RTP media streams to IP mul- ticast addresses and make it more suitable for broadcasting, SIP creates an infra- structure of clients and servers, comparable to a telephony network, even though IP  multicast sessions should also be set up using SIP.  With HTTP, the client  browser  always issues GET or POST requests. With  SMTP, the client uses SEND to submit an outgoing e-mail to a SMTP server. With  RTSP, the client is the only one issuing the PLAY request.  However, SIP user agents  UA  are able to register to the network previously   using the SIP REGISTER method . Actually the UA consists of a User Agent Cli- ent  UAC  side and a User Agent Server  UAS  side, and it’s the UAC performing  that registration. Following the registration, the network  SIP Proxy server, UAC   can direct incoming session requests  SIP INVITE , messages  SIP MESSAGE  or  capability discovery requests  SIP OPTIONS  from the entire world to the destina- tion UA  more speciﬁcally its UAS side .  As RFC 3261 says, SIP supports personal mobility: users can maintain a single  externally visible identiﬁer  e.g., sip:32496127638@ngvas.com  regardless of their  network location. The managers of this mobility are the SIP servers of the domain  of that identiﬁer  e.g., sip1.ngvas.com and sip2.ngvas.com . External sources will  ﬁnd these SIP servers by querying the public Domain Name Server  DNS  infra- structure, as explained in RFC 3263  Locating SIP servers .  The IETF’s enum group went as far as submitting a DNS directory structure to  IANA for the e164.arpa domain  e.g., 8.3.6.7.2.1.6.9.4.2.3.e164.arpa , in an attempt  to let SIP servers discover the next hop to reach any telephone number on the planet.  Some countries  e.g., Austria  tried to launch a public ENUM infrastructure. But  this attempt to attract the E.164 numbering plan into the Internet has not been very  successful, for security, performance, and organizational reasons — who would have  had the authority to update this DNS information? To allocate number ranges?  Worse, to deal with number portability processes?  Of course, the originating UA  UAC  can also submit outbound requests to a  SIP server  UAS; e.g., sip.ngvas.com , in order to reach the rest of the world.

SIMPLE inher- ited the PIDF from the impp, but extended it to cater for watcher information,  contact information, rich presence extensions and timed status information.  3.2.4 Security Area Next to mobility aspects, security is a rising general concern for new communica- tion protocols and architectures. The success of a technology like GSM is partly  due to the facts that nobody ever succeeded to break GSM authentication  i.e., to  impersonate someone else’s Subscriber Identity Module  nor to pull down a GSM  network with a Denial-of-Service attack.  Current Internet Protocol security protocol  IPsec , Transport Layer Security   TLS  and Internet Key Exchange protocol  IKE  present somewhat of an all-or- nothing alternative; these protocols provide protection from a wide array of possible  threats, but, as the Better-Than-Nothing Security  BTNS  working group recog- nizes, are sometimes not deployed because of the need for preexisting credentials,  such as the ones inside a GSM SIM.  3.2.5 Conclusion for the IETF NGN The IETF continues to deliver, by far, the most solid standardization work for the  NGN. It could beneﬁt from a more coherent approach toward mobility manage- ment, though.  At Network level, the IETF promoted device-impacting technologies such as  IPv6, MIPv4 v6, HMIP FMIP, and, in general, IP over new bearers. It now realizes that it could have decoupled the non-device-impacting mobility inside a local area,  from whatever mobility protocol in the core of the Internet  e.g., MIPv4, MIPv6,  3GPP GPRS Tunneling Protocol, SIP REGISTER .  In the Media and Border Gateways layer, IP multicast and RTP are brilliant  technologies but the generally perceived VoIP quality is low on the public Internet,  except with QoS enforcement or peer-to-peer protocols.  In the Session Control layer, the IETF also came to the conclusion that mobil- ity needs to be hierarchical, namely as hierarchical as there will be SIP proxies in  the path of an incoming SIP INVITE. In theory, IETF’s DNS queries are going  to  be  slower  than  3GPP’s  DIAMETER  queries  to  a  Home  Subscriber  Server   HSS .  But the degree of mobility communication consumers are expecting is rapidly  increasing anyway: cross-network, cross-technology and with seamless in-session  handover.  This brings us to the work of the 3GPP.   44  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  3.3 3GPP The 3rd Generation Partnership Project  3GPP  is the current owner, from network  standards perspective, of GSM  2G* , the packet-based GPRS  2.5G† , and related  higher-speed cellular mobile wireless technology  2.75G‡–3G§–3.5G¶ . 3GPP inher- ited the responsibility for 2G technology from ETSI SMG  Special Mobile Group .  Some of the 3GPP technologies are pure radio network technologies  EDGE,  UMTS,  HSPA ,  designed  to  enhance  access  speeds   for  packetized  data   in  the  radio access network, with as little impact as possible on the core network. In fact  there’s only one technology for the packet-based core network: GPRS.  It is on top of this packet-switched domain that 3GPP deﬁned its “NGN plus”   as the IP Multimedia Subsystem  IMS .  3GPP’s strategy is one of Fixed-Mobile Convergence  FMC , with as midterm  target that the IMS would become the umbrella core network not only above the  mobile packet-switched radio access network but also above the ﬁxed broadband  access networks  e.g., DSL, cable modems, DVB . The IMS would oﬀer solutions  for universal problems such as strong authentication, mobility management across  access networks, and quality-of-service over packet networks.  The assumption is that the mobile and ﬁxed networks in a same country will be   run by a same administrative entity, oﬀering multiplay services.  The  services  layer,  the  supervision,  provisioning  and  charging billing  infra- structures could then be shared among ﬁxed broadband and mobile access divi- sions, producing cost savings in these FMC-ready organizations.  3.3.1 UMA Step zero of FMC has been the adoption by 3GPP of Unlicensed Mobile Access   UMA  technology, where the WiFi hot spot federation needs to be directly con- nected to the GSM Network SubSystem  via the so-called A-interface  for voice,  and to the Packet-Switched Core  via Gb Iu interface  for data. Thus, UMA access  could not be oﬀered from say a hotel’s WiFi hot spot in a foreign visited country, as  the hotel’s ISP is not connected to a GSM GPRS core network.  UMA is an extension of the 2G-2.5G authentication and local  access network    mobility schemes to cover the WiFi domain.  Due to the immaturity of IETF’s SIP technology for authentication and mobil- ity management issues, 3GPP was forced to adopt the GSM A-interface protocols   BSSMAP DTAP, 3GPP TS 04.08  and to rely on the GSM SIM.  * Global System for Mobile communications, the second generation cellular network. † General Packet Radio Service. ‡ EDGE: Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution. § UMTS: Universal Mobile Telephony System, also known as Wideband CDMA  W-CDMA . ¶ HSDPA: High Speed Downlink Packet Access.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  45  Figure 3.2 Unlicensed Mobile Access — a strategic mistake?  UMA is probably a historic missed opportunity to extend the 2.5G 3G global  mobility management  GPRS UMTS core network  toward independent, visited  federations of WiFi hot spots, connected to the GPRS Roaming eXchange  GRX   backbone via the GPRS Tunneling Protocol  GTP, 3GPP TS 09.60   29.060 . Some  independent companies* had built these bridges between hot spot federations and  the GRX providers, but mobile service providers, having ambitions to roll out their  own hot spots in the homes, never adopted this principle.  The local mobility protocol  across the hot spots of a single federation  would then  have been out of scope of 3GPP. It could have been IETF MIPv4, MIPv6, a propri- etary non-device-impacting solution, or better, the upcoming non-device-impacting  work of IETF netlmm.  Authentication  could  have  used  Extensible  Authentication  Protocol  in  the  access network  EAP, IETF RFC 3748  and Mobile Application Part in the core   MAP, 3GPP TS 09.02   29.002 . Or SMS authentication, a very strong scheme in  which the mobile phone owner requests a password to be sent by SMS to the mobile  handset, and enters his mobile phone number plus that password to access the hot  spot  or service in general . Or any other mechanism to verify an existing active  charging billing relationship with the home mobile operator.  *  That is, the WeRoam.com oﬀer by Comfone of Switzerland, part of the Togewa holding.   46  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Some will see the hand of the GSM Association, who would have refused to  grant full membership to ISPs and WiFi federations, therefore would have denied  them the rights to  Close roaming agreements, specifying their inter-operator tariﬀs  IOT  for   Internet access via WiFi and other broadband access technologies  Connect to the international SS7 networks  using MAP for authentication   and mobility procedures   Use CAMEL  Customized Application of Mobile Enhanced Logic, 3GPP  TS 03.78   23.078   09.78   29.078  for real-time charging to the mobile  prepaid account  Connect  to  roaming  clearing  houses,  for  inter-operator  CDR  exchange   and settlement  The aforementioned scheme  let’s call it UMA 2.0  was actually realized and  is currently in commercial operation by a few hot spot federations owned by, or  closely linked to, mobile operators.  From a macroeconomic perspective, it would have made sense to reuse the exist- ing charging, top-up, billing and customer care resources  infrastructure, employ- ees  of the  home  mobile operators. Broadband Internet service providers and hot  spot federations could have  become  diligent and loyal  resellers of  what remains  essentially a basket of mobile operator services.  It is also a safe bet that the addition of unlicensed Internet access would have   increased the general adoption and turnover of mobile data.  But UMA 2.0, by supporting VoIP and IM, would have put circuit-switched  voice and sms revenue and price under strong pressure. It’s a battle the GSM opera- tors aren’t prepared to ﬁght. Today’s regulatory threats to roaming revenues are a little  teaser compared to what could happen in case of widespread UMA 2.0.  UMA  1.0  market trials have indeed shown that in practice, 70% of communi-  cations were made through the residential hot spot, and 30% via GSM.  3.3.2 IMS Fundamentally, the 3GPP IMS’s goal is to be an IETF NGN “plus.”  But, as we will see in the upcoming Section 3.5, it soon became a TISPAN   NGN “minus.”  3GPP has used its recognized experience in the domains of authentication and  mobility to address the main “holes” in the IETF NGN: security, mobility, service  hooks and QoS enforcement. These are actually area’s which are still open, con- stantly evolving and where it’s not sure whether a dominant solution will emerge.  Let’s therefore consider them more closely in the upcoming sections.  Besides these topics, 3GPP IMS also  Deﬁned private and public user identities   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  47  Extended SIP  in IMS Stage 3, TS 24.229 Release 7, Section 7 , and adopted   SIP signaling  header  compression  in Section 8   Speciﬁed the interworking of the IM core network with the circuit-switched  domains   GSM UMTS PSTN ISDN   using  ISUP  and  BICC   in  TS  29.163 Release 7   Embraced some services such as presence, instant messaging, conferencing,   group management  It should be noticed that 3GPP uses slightly diﬀerent terminology for the func-  tional planes:  “Control Plane” for session control “User Plane” for the border and media gateways  3.3.2.1 Security Whereas the distribution of authentication credentials is not addressed in an IETF  NGN, 3GPP speciﬁed an own access security mechanism  AKA: Authentication  and Key Agreement, TS 33.203  based on SIP registration and on a secret number  in the ISIM, rather than on IETF’s lower layer protocols  IPsec TLS IKE . The  IMS User Entity  UE  thus consists of a SIP User Agent  UA  and the IP Multime- dia Subscriber Identity Module  ISIM .  Maybe 3GPP should have been more forward-looking and adopted the Exten-  sible Authentication Protocol  EAP, RFC 3748  instead of SIP REGISTER.  The  security  algorithm  itself,  which  the  ISIM  uses  to  calculate  a  response   XRES  for a random challenge, with the ISIM’s secret number as the other input,  is not part of standardization.  Good access security also means that the UE should also be able to authenticate  the IMS. Therefore, the UE receives a message authentication code  MAC  from  the network, and calculates an expected message authentication code  XMAC  to  see if these match. The algorithm is also out of scope of standardization.  Once the ISIM has been authenticated by the IMS, and vice versa, SIP signaling   between the User Agent and the network is encrypted using an agreed session key.  In an IMS, the IETF’s lower layer security protocols are only used for network   domain security  between the SIP servers and HSS, see 3GPP TS 33.210 .  3.3.2.2 Mobility Contrary to the IETF which is still struggling, ETSI and 3GPP have always real- ized the beneﬁts of hierarchical mobility architectures. The structure of the GSM  radio and core networks reﬂects this:  The  Base  Transceiver  Station   BTS   preserves  radio  contact  while  the   Mobile Station  MS  moves within one or a few cells.  The Base Station Controller  BSC  manages the mobility of the MS across   a set of BTS.   48  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  The Visited Mobile Switching Center  VMSC  manages the mobility of the  MS across multiple BSCs. When the MS moves from VMSC to another,  the Home Location Register  HLR  keeps track of where to ﬁnd the MS    i.e., at which VMSC , should there be incoming calls or messages. If the  new VMSC is within the same network  i.e., the MS is not roaming out to  a foreign VMSC , ongoing calls are seamlessly handed over from the old to  the new VMSC  but the old VMSC remains involved in the call .  The Gateway Mobile Switching Center  GMSC  is able to direct inbound  calls to the correct VMSC, by querying the HLR  the HLR then obtains  a temporary number from the VMSC . For incoming calls, the GMSC  and HLR thus manage the top level mobility in a 2G network. The same  design  philosophy  is  present  in  the  Packet-Switched  domain   2.5G– 2.75G–3G–3.5G PS  and in the IMS  see 3GPP 23.228, IMS Stage 2 .  The  node-B  preserves  radio  contact  while  the  User  Entity   UE   moves   within one or a few cells.  The  Radio  Network  Controller   RNC   and  Packet  Coding  Unit   PCU   manage the mobility of the UE within a Routing Area  i.e., a set of cells . The Serving GPRS Support Node  SGSN  manages the mobility of the  UE across multiple Routing Area’s. When the MS moves from SGSN to  another, the Home Subscriber Server  HSS  keeps track of where to ﬁnd  the MS, should there be network-requested Packet Data Protocol  PDP   contexts. If the new SGSN is within the same network  i.e., the MS is  not roaming out to a foreign SGSN , active PDP contexts are seamlessly  handed over from the old to the new SGSN.  The Gateway GPRS Support Node  GGSN  forms the permanent point of  interconnection with Public Data Networks  PDN  such as the Internet.  PDP contexts are created between the SGSN and GGSN using a proto- col called GTP  GPRS Tunneling Protocol . The GGSN is informed by  GTP if the UE moves to a new SGSN while a PDP context is active. The  GGSN is also capable to query the HSS to ﬁnd the UE’s current SGSN,  for network-requested PDP context activation toward that UE.  A Proxy Call Session Control Function  P-CSCF  is the ﬁrst point of con- tact for all SIP messages between the UE and the IMS; it receives the SIP  REGISTER request from the UE, and proxies it to an Interrogating CSCF   I-CSCF , which queries the HSS. The HSS allocates a suitable Serving  CSCF   S-CSCF   and  the  I-CSCF  proxies  SIP  REGISTER  to  that  S- CSCF. The P-CSCF proxies outbound  i.e., UE-originated  SIP INVITE  directly to a S-CSCF in the Home Network. The P-CSCF is also the ﬁrst  point of contact for inbound sessions to the Visited Network.  The I-CSCF in the Home Network is capable of querying the HSS in order  to ﬁnd the UE’s current S-CSCF, for inbound sessions toward that UE. The I-CSCF and HSS thus manage the top-level mobility in an IMS, for   inbound sessions.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  49  However, the need to break the CSCF into three entities, or even the need for an  open interface between CSCF and HSS has gone away, since 3GPP recognized that  the IMS would be accessed solely through GGSNs of the Home PLMN.  Indeed, in the early days of IMS  2000-2002 , it was believed that a P-CSCF  in Visited Network A  just next to Visited GGSN A  would have to communicate  with an I-CSCF in Home Network B, via SIP and over an international network  called IPX  IP eXchange . Also, a S-CSCF may have been assigned in the Visited  Network A  just next to Visited GGSN A , to communicate with the HSS in Home  Network B.  Today,  we  know  that  in  practice,  the  SGSN  A  will  only  communicate  to  a  GGSN  B  in  the  Home  Network,  over  the  GRX   GPRS  Roaming  eXchange .  Indeed, as many services  e.g., real-time charging, IP content ﬁltering  are Home  GGSN-based, using Visited GGSNs is not an option anymore. Moreover, there  had been the unsolved questions about how the inbound roamer B would ﬁnd the  Access Point Name to GGSN A in a visited network, why he she would even try to,  and whether that APN would be have been provisioned in his her HLR B  or just a  default setting then allowing any APN .  Hence  as  all  elements   P-CSCF,  I-CSCF,  S-CSCF,  HSS  but  also  SBC  and  MGCF  are all in the subscriber’s home network anyway, the functional separation  into diﬀerent logical entities is not needed anymore, and just makes ineﬃcient use  of resources, compared to a traditional architecture of Class 5 and Class 4 NGN  softswitches. The elements waste a lot of energy  CPU power  to encode decode  messages between each other, rather than spending these cycles on the interfaces to  the external world  user entities and other networks .  3.3.2.3 Service Hooks Besides session-level mobility, 3GPP provides the hooks to let the session plane trigger   invite the service plane, but only at call session setup stage.  The  2G-2.5G-3G  mechanism  is  CAMEL.*  The  HLR  holds  the  necessary  CAMEL subscription information  CSI, including the address of the Service Con- trol Function . For originating calls, the HLR inserts O-CSI into the Visited Net- work  Visited MSC VLR  when the mobile phone is initially powered on  more  speciﬁcally  during  the  Location  Update Insert  Subscriber  Data  procedure .  For  terminating calls, the T-CSI is interpreted by the Home Network  Gateway MSC   when received from the HLR  in response to a Send Routing Info request .  The IMS mechanism is the “evaluation of initial ﬁlter criteria” and is performed  by the S-CSCF in the Originating or in the Terminating Home Network, which can  invite SIP Application Servers  AS . Again the HSS holds the necessary criteria.  The session plane needs to trigger invite important “originating” services such  as prepaid real-time charging, lawful interception, and centrex. But increasingly,   *  Customised Application of Mobile Enhance Logic.   50  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  the session plane will need to trigger and invite services regarding terminating calls  and sessions.  A destination user may indeed have chosen to receive the inbound call session  in a non-GSM or non-IMS environment, meaning without having informed the  HLR HSS about its location in that new environment. Maybe the user has devices  located simultaneously in both 3GPP and non-3GPP networks.  Examples include the following:  An instant messaging, gaming user, or IPTV watcher wishing to receive  inbound calls, messages and sessions inside an IM program, online game  or MPEG2 stream, when logged on there  rather than to the cell phone  A business user away from his her desktop PC, and expecting the incoming   calls to be handled by the company’s receptionist  The mobile user of a standard dual-mode GSM WiFi phone, supporting  VoIP and maybe SIP, but not necessarily IMS, and expecting seamless  WiFi-to-GSM handover  An outbound roamer, for whom it is cheaper to receive incoming VoIP calls  on a plain vanilla VoIP WiFi handset than on the roaming GSM phone An American mobile user, who pays for incoming calls to the mobile side   but not for incoming VoIP calls through a WiFi hotspot  With revenues from subscriptions, outbound, and international roaming traﬃc  decreasing, it becomes very important for 3GPP network operators to attract more  inbound traﬃc through its GMSCs and I-CSCFs as the anchor points.  Though 3GPP networks would support these terminating services  as well as of  course the originating  in a basic form, the hooks in the session plane are insuﬃ- cient to compete with nonstandard implementations, hence to keep attracting that  inbound traﬃc.  When interrogated by the I-CSCF in the Terminating Home Network, a ﬁrst  hurdle is that the HSS should accept to reply with a default S-CSCF, if the destina- tion subscriber is not registered in the HSS  or even unknown . It is a design ﬂaw that  the I-CSCF cannot query the SIP AS directly  as the GMSC can query the CSE* .  The service plane can then instruct the session plane to proxy the call or session   to the non-3GPP environment, via a conversion gateway.  Second, 3GPP GSM and IMS oﬀer no hooks in the call session plane to provide  seamless, in-call handover from one environment  e.g., inbound VoIP over WiFi  to  the other  e.g., GSM . This is true for both terminating calls sessions to the E.164  telephone number, as for calls sessions originating in a 3GPP network which need  to be handed over to a non-3GPP environment.  *  CAMEL Service Environment.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  51  The key decision when to perform that handover can be made only by the service  plane, based on presence, availability or VoIP quality measurements. But the ser- vice plane would then need to instruct the session plane “mid-call’’ “mid-session.” Third, can the 3GPP IMS session plane invite the service selectively, only for   certain media types, origins or destinations  e.g., not for emergency calls ?  Next, is the 3GPP IMS session plane going to be capable of inviting multiple  services  for example, prepaid and lawful interception  for a given session, in parallel  or sequentially? Or will the SIP AS have to proxy one to another? It’s too easy for  3GPP to push out the service orchestration issues to the service plane.  In summary, 3GPP networks do support some hooks to the service plane, but   will need to progress in this area.  For inbound traﬃc, communication service subscribers today demand added  value: the convenience to be reachable behind an expensive E.164 mobile phone  number is not enough anymore.  If 3GPP fails to enable the new FMC and multiplay services, in the near future  we might well set up our calls and sessions using SIP to e-mail addresses instead of  to E.164 telephone numbers.  3.3.2.4 QoS Enforcement In the 3GPP IMS, the P-CSCF contains a Policy Decision Function  PDF , which  can instruct the access network node  Gateway GPRS Support Node, Mobile IP  Home Agent or Broadband Remote Access Server  to apply a given IP Quality of  Service  IP QoS  via Common Open Policy Service  COPS  protocol on the Go  interface. This is the COPS response to an initial query by the GGSN.*  In order to understand the IMS session binding and QoS enforcement, let’s  consider the case of an IMS session being set up between two User Entities  UE 1  and UE 2 . UE 1 is registered to the Originating IMS 1, and UE 2 to the Terminat- ing IMS 2. Therefore, a primary access channel  e.g., PDP context, PPPoE session   must have been created to convey the SIP signaling in IMS 1.  Upon SIP INVITE, the Originating S-CSCF as well as the Terminating S- CSCF will verify that UE 1 and UE 2 are entitled to set up the media streams  proposed by UE 1  described in the SDP, RFC 2327 . Indeed, the HSS contains  the allowed media.  SIP  INVITE  is  acknowledged  hop-by-hop  with  a  “100  Trying”  provisional   response, in order to avoid time-outs.  The PDF at the Terminating P-CSCF produces an IMS Authorization Token   and adds it in the SIP INVITE toward UE 2.  *  And, in the future, by a Home Agent  HA  for Mobile IP networks, or a Broadband Remote   Access Server  BRAS  for DSL networks.   52  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  A  A  A  Figure 3.3 Session setup and quality-of-service enforcement in IMS.  UE 2 communicates its SDP information  according to RFC 3264  in a backward   SIP 183 Session Progress message, which will be authorized by both S-CSCF.  Also  at  this  point,  UE  2  already  generates  Flow-IDs,  for  each  secondary  access  channel   PDP  context   that  will  be  set-up  for  a  media  type  listed  in  the  SDP. The PDF at the Terminating P-CSCF in IMS 2 authorizes the use of these  resources:  “is  there  enough  overall  bandwidth  left  to  set  up  all  these  secondary  access channels?”  So does the PDF at the Originating P-CSCF in IMS 1, upon receipt of SIP 183   Session Progress. It also produces an Authorization Code.  Upon receipt of the SIP 183 message, UE 1 produces Flow-IDs for the Autho-  rization Token, and informs UE 2  SIP PRACK .  Now  UE  2  activates  secondary  access  channels  for  each  of  the  media  types  involved, passing the combination of Authorization Token and Flow-ID. While  doing so, UE 2 requests an appropriate access QoS for each media type listed in the  SDP. Strangely, in IMS, it is up to the UE to select the access QoS, so it could request  a high UMTS QoS for media not requiring it!  The local GGSN veriﬁes the bindings between Authorization Token and Flow- IDs, via COPS protocol on the Go interface. Go is set up between a Policy Control    Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  53  Function  PCF, terminating GGSN in this case  and the PDF  at the Terminating  P-CSCF . “Yes, these resources have been previously authorized …”  During this process, the PDF informs the PCF about the maximum IP QoS  to be applied for each access channel. The PCF will also inform the PDF P-CSCF  about the Charging Correlation Identiﬁers  IMS Charging ID, GPRS Charging  ID  which will allow correlating duration-based IMS charging with volume-based  access charging. When a time-based IMS session took place, the corresponding  access volume charges will probably be waived.  When all secondary access channels are successfully set up, and the bindings veri- ﬁed, UE 2 informs UE 1 by acknowledging the PRACK message  with SIP 200 OK . UE 1, the Originating GGSN and PDF P-CSCF in IMS 1 now also set up the   secondary access channels and verify the bindings.  At the end, SIP UPDATE informs IMS 2 and UE 2, and when UE 2 acknowl-  edges  SIP 200 OK , the QoS is ﬁnally enforced.  Next  not shown anymore on the diagram , IMS 2 will send a backwards SIP  180 Ringing signal, which will be acknowledged by IMS 1 with a forward PRACK   and IMS 2 acknowledges that PRACK with backwards 200 OK .  When UE 2 ﬁnally accepts the session  takes the call , a backwards 200 OK  message ﬂows to UE 1, which acknowledges that to UE 2  forward SIP ACK .  Media can then ﬁnally ﬂow between UE 1 and UE 2.  The IP QoS can be of the DiﬀServ type, where access network router sets the  IP Type of Service  ToS  bits, also called DiﬀServ Code Point  DSCP, IETF RFC  2427 . DiﬀServ is a coarse QoS mechanism, as the same QoS is then applied for all  packets in that access channel  e.g., PDP context   Optionally in some PCF, the IP QoS can be of the IntServ type, a ﬁne-grained  QoS mechanism by which the access node  e.g., GGSN  will use Reservation Pro- tocol  RSVP  to request a QoS better than best eﬀort, for each uplink and down- link media stream within a single access channel  e.g., PDP context .  IMS QoS enforcement not only impacts the access network nodes  e.g., GGSN   but also the User Entities of each present and future access technology. That is, it  requires new mobile phones, which link the SIP layer to the transport technology   e.g., GPRS, UMTS .  As such, IMS QoS enforcement may actually never happen. Seen in the broad picture of a User Plane, a Session Plane and an Service Plane,   again is diﬃcult to see how the Service Plane will:  Be  informed  about  the  proposed  and  the  ultimately  negotiated  media   streams  e.g., for prepaid tariﬀ determination   Inﬂuence the QoS being applied  e.g., increase the QoS for calls to from   the operator’s own IP access networks   So, last but not least, QoS enforcement in IMS is service-agnostic.   54  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  3.3.2.5 Conclusion for the IMS Regarding the IMS, there are some concerns that:  The degree of security, mobility and service triggering is not suﬃcient to jus- tify the investment in a much more complex system than the IETF NGN. The decomposed architecture itself of the IMS  breakdown of a softswitch  to P-CSCF, S-CSCF, I-CSCF and even HSS  cannot be justiﬁed any- more, and wastes computing resources on internal interfaces.  QoS enforcement is complex in IMS, increases the delay to set up a basic call,  and requires close interaction between the SIP signaling and underlying mobile  data transport layer in the terminal; it is thus not possible to just download an IMS  User Entity on any IP device.  The features of PSTN ISDN networks  supplementary services, and regu- latory obligations such as lawful interception and number portability   will not be supported by the IMS itself anyway.  Messaging  SMS, MMS  appears to have been totally forgotten in the IMS. Architectural separation of a session plane and a user plane is possible, even  in the circuit-switched  CS  domain of 2G mobile networks, using MSC  servers controlling media gateways, without deploying an IMS on the  packet-switched  PS  side.  3GPP stretched itself from the mobile wireless space into ﬁxed broadband, an   area with very diﬀerent requirements.  An IETF NGN would outperform a 3GPP IMS if that IETF NGN would be   augmented with:  User authentication via EAP or SMS  instead of ISIM USIM . TLS PKI security between network nodes  same as in IMS . Non-device impacting local mobility  instead of 2.5G-3G mobility man-  agement of the GERAN UTRAN .  Either 3GPP GTP, IETF SIP or IETF MIP as global mobility mechanism   instead of 3GPP GTP  cid:11  IMS SIP , with header compression  as in IMS .

Some of these items are today addressed by TISPAN, of which we’ll review the   work in Section 3.5.  3.4 3GPP2 The 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 was established in 1998, as a cooperation  between standards institutes from Japan, China, North America, and South Korea. 3GPP2 is today driving the CDMA2000 family of packet-based technologies,  as the successor to 2G CDMA  cdmaOne, TIA IS-95 , and in analogy with 3GPP  driving the evolution of GSM.  Within the CDMA2000 family, multiple generations of mobile wireless cel- lular technologies were born: 2.5G-2.75G  CDMA2000 1x  and 3G  CDMA2000  1x EV-DO* .  On top of these radio access technologies, and besides the circuit-switched core  network, 3GPP2 developed a packet-based core network similar to 3GPP GPRS.  It consists mainly of Packet Data Serving Nodes  PDSN, the equivalent of 3GPP’s  SGSN  and the Home Agent  HA, the counterpart of 3GPP’s GGSN .  Contrary to 3GPP, 3GPP2 adopted IETF’s Mobile IP protocol, allowing the   HA to track a subscriber’s mobility across a set of PDSN.  But on top of this core network, 3GPP probably made a strategic mistake not to   adopt the IMS, and ended up specifying their own MultiMedia Domain  MMD .  Also, 3GPP2 does not have the market power to develop an FMC strategy, to   let this MMD span ﬁxed access networks too.  It is not the ﬁrst time that 3GPP2 would deﬁne a technology that would stall   due to lack of implementation and adoption  e.g., CDMA2000 1x EV-DV† .  3.5 TISPAN ETSI has bundled its Next Generation Network eﬀorts in the Telecommunications  and Internet Converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking  TIS- PAN  “one-stop-shopping” working group, a merger of the former groups:  Network Aspects  NA  Signaling Protocols and Switching  SPS   *  Evolution for Data Only, or “Data Optimized,” TIA IS-856. †  Evolution for Data and Voice, of which Qualcomm halted the development in 2005.   56  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  t  n e m p u q E  i    r e s U  Service Layer  User  Profiles  Network  Attachment Subsystem  Transport  Layer  Applications  Other  Subsystems Core IMS  PSTN ISDN Emulation Subsystem  s k r o w e N  t    r e h O  t  Resource and  Admission Control  Subsystem  Transfer Functions  Figure 3.4 TISPAN NGN overall architecture.  Services and Protocols for Advanced Networks  SPAN  Telecom and Internet Protocol Harmonization Over Networks  TIPHON   Whereas ETSI’s inﬂuence was conﬁned to Europe, TISPAN.org is now leading   an independent and international life, just like 3GPP.  And we must say, with success. Oﬃcially, TISPAN has incorporated the 3GPP IMS at the heart of its NGN  architecture and there will be a single IMS for both mobile and ﬁxed access. The  following diagram shows the overall architecture of the TISPAN Next Generation  Network, as described in the standard ES 282 001:  In fact, TISPAN has corrected the mobile-centric aspects of 3GPP IMS releases   5 and 6, and many shortcomings in the ﬁxed access part of 3GPP IMS release 7.  TISPAN NGN Release 1 contains over 70 deliverables of various types:  12 Technical Reports  TR  39 Technical Speciﬁcations  TS  issued by TISPAN only 20 ETSI Standards  ES  endorsed by the ETSI members   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  57  A  A  A  Figure 3.5 TISPAN PSTN Emulation Subsystem  PES .  The speciﬁcations cover service requirements, architecture and protocols, plus a   few extra aspects such as security, QoS, ENUM and TMN.  TISPAN has endorsed the 3GPP IMS Stage 2 architecture  TS 182 006, 3GPP  23.338 , corrected 3GPP Release 7 IMS for ﬁxed broadband access  ES 282 007 ,  and added the  PSTN ISDN Emulation Subsystem  PES, TS 182 012 and ES 282 002  Resource and Admission Control Subsystem  RACS, ES 282 003  Network Attachment SubSystem  NASS, ES 282 004  Emergency Call Services  ECS, TS 182 009   Figure 3.5 represents the architecture of the PES: This diagram is inspired by ES 282 002, but illustrates the position of the vari-  ous gateways in the home, the enterprise and the service provider realm.  Within the PES, the Access Gateway Control Function  AGCF  has interfaces  To the Residential GateWays  RGW in the home , controlled via ITU-T’s  H.248 protocol, and oﬀering local analog telephony  twisted copper pair  at  the  Z  reference  point   or  ISDN   double  copper  pair,  S T  interface  point .   58  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  To ISDN Access GateWays  AGW  located within the enterprise, or on service  provider premises, oﬀering the ISDN Primary Rate Interface  PRI service  at the so-called “T” reference point  and more advanced variants  DPNSS,  QSIG . The AGCF receives  “backhauls”  the ISDN DSS1 signaling over  SIGTRAN ISDN User Adaptation  IUA , and pilots the AGW via H.248  protocol, in order to create RTP media streams to the IP access network.  To V5.2 Access GateWays  AGW , which were referred to as “Remote Sub- scriber Units”  RSU  in classic telephony, and which are connected to the  core network via the V5.2 interface: the V5.2 protocol over SIGTRAN V5  User Adaptation  V5UA . The AGCF also pilots these AGW via H.248.  To analog and ISDN Access GateWays  AGW  also controlled via H.248,  within a Multi-Service Access Node  MSAN . A MSAN may include V5  RSU technology, and will also provide the broadband Internet access ser- vices  using DSL technologies, cable, ﬁber to the home, etc. . Again, the  AGCF pilots the AGW via H.248.  To the SIP-I core network  SIP for Interconnection, see Section 3.6.5 , for  example,  in  order  to  reach  the  Trunking  Gateway  Control  Function   TGCF . The TGCF controls Trunking GateWays  TGW  via H.248,  and sends SS7 ISUP over SIGTRAN M3UA  or MTP3 over SIGTRAN  M2PA  via Signaling GateWays  SGW  to the legacy PSTN and ISDN. To  the  other  TISPAN  NGN  subsystems,  which  includes  the  RACS.  The  RACS deals with admission control  possibly with overbooking , resource  reservation  for bearer resources such as port numbers , policy control  to  enforce IP QoS , remote NAT traversal and local NAT. It is composed of The Service Policy Decision Function  SPDF : a single point of contact for Access  Functions  AF  such as the Proxy-Call Session Control Function  P-CSCF   or Interconnection Border Control Function  I-BCF  over a DIAMETER  Gq’ interface; the SPDF opens and closes the gates for communication on the  Core or Interconnection Border Gateway Functions  C-BGF or I-BGF .  The Access and Resource Allocation Control Function  A-RACF : is invoked  by the SPDF in order to take decisions based on current network load, and  communicates them to the IP Edge, for example, a Broadband Remote  Access Server  BRAS  for xDSL access  Layer 2 Termination Function and  Resource Control Enforcement Function , via the Re interface.  The NASS is responsible for IP address allocation and other traditional Authen- tication, Authorization and Accounting  AAA  functions in the access network.  It is invoked by an Access Management Function  AMF  at the IP edge  i.e., the  BRAS, in the xDSL access example . It stores the IP address which was allocated to  a given user device, as this may be useful information to applications.  The TISPAN architecture is very complete and advanced, however one may  wonder whether it doesn’t require specialized entities or sub-contractors to operate  the RACS and NASS.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  59  The TISPAN NGN is much more versatile than the “naked” 3GPP IMS. It  can be used to provide PSTN emulation services, SIP-based IMS services, IP TV,  peer-to-peer solutions, or even allows the end user to request more bandwidth on  the ﬂy — sometimes referred to as “the Turbo button.”  ITU-T  3.6 Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, the Telecommunications Standardization Sector  of the International Telecommunications Union  ITU  produced the most important  standards for public and private circuit-switched telecommunications.  ISDN  3.6.1 Digital telephony was introduced at the end of the 1980s under ITU-T’s ISDN stan- dards  Integrated Services Digital Network : the Q.9XX series of recommendations. The  ISDN  spanned  the  digital  core  network,  the  residential  access  network   analog and digital , and the enterprise network  digital PBX  — as the NGN today  does.  British Telecom completed ISDN with DPNSS  Digital Private Network Sig- naling System , allowing advanced supplementary services to be supported across  multiple company PBX’s.  ETSI  took  a  similar  initiative   QSIG   which  was  more  widely  adopted,  but   DPNSS remains technically superior.  3.6.2 SS7 Signaling In order to convey the core network signaling, ITU-T created Signaling System  number 7  SS7  as the Q.7XX series of recommendations, with a ﬁrst stable ver- sion in 1988  the so-called Blue Book  and quite stable revision in 1993  the White  Book . It has permitted national and international interconnection of digital tele- phony exchanges. It is universally appreciated for its accuracy, robustness, excel- lent interworking  e.g., with international ISUP, Q.767 . Even though inevitably,  regional variants have appeared  ANSI SS7 .  SS7 is structured as the Message Transfer Part  MTP  at data link and network  layer, and either the ISDN User Part  ISUP, for call set-up , or the Signaling Con- nection and Control Part  SCCP, for other signaling . Above SCCP, the Transac- tion Capabilities Application Part  TCAP  allows associate requests and responses  in a dialogue.  Wow! This is probably the shortest overview ever on SS7! .  The Global System for Mobile communications  GSM , the largest telecom- munication system on earth, relies heavily on SS7, for call set-up as well as for  mobility tracking  location update procedures, routing of incoming calls and mes- sages  and security  terminal and SIM authentication . Overall, probably 80% of    60  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  the signaling exchange for calls, SMS and mobility events uses pure SS7. A small  portion in the mobile access network  between MS and MSC, and between BTS  and BSC  is based on ISDN access signaling.  An  interesting  ITU-T  development  is  Bearer  Independent  Call  Control   BICC, Q.1901 , a signaling protocol allowing broadband multimedia streams to  be set up  Q.1970  besides narrowband circuits to be connected  Q.1950 . Also,  BICC signaling itself can be conveyed over a broadband network  IP . Besides  the two core network protocols, there’s also a BICC variant for access signaling   Q.1930 .  BICC Capability Set 2  2001  was adopted by 3GPP for its Release 4 UMTS   speciﬁcations.  3.6.3 Intelligent Network Part of the success of GSM is due to the ability for customers to use it without  preestablished contract, monthly subscription fee, or billing address. The prepaid  mode has dramatically lowered the barrier of entry, and is used today by more than  60% of all mobile phone users worldwide. This fraction is bound to rise further, as  almost all new users are connected in developing countries.  With their Q.12XX series laying the basis of the Intelligent Network, ITU-T  created the standard to let digital telephony exchanges communicate with exter- nal computers  the prepaid IN platforms . Also there, more reﬁned variants have  appeared  ETSI Core INAP, GSM CAMEL, CDMA Wireless IN  but the impact  of ITU-T has been decisive. Though the IN was foreseen to become a multiapplica- tion VAS platform, the killer app is prepaid.  ITU-T’s Intelligent Network Application Part  INAP  is carried over TCAP,  over SCCP, over MTP. But it can also be carried over IP networks as INAP over  TCAP over SIGTRAN SUA.  3.6.4 Media Encoding Also  in  the  media  and  border  gateways  layer,  ITU-T  is  the  main  actor,  for  the  ISDN, GSM and NGN. Echo canceling and the compression of audio and voice   multiple codecs  are standardized in ITU-T’s G series. The most commonly used  codecs for VoIP are  G.711: 64 Kbit s, also used for circuit-switched digital landline telephony,   MOS*  cid:29  4.1.  G.729.1: as of 14 Kbit s, for wideband audio  50–7000 Hz , MOS  cid:113  4. G.729: 8Kbit s only, but unable to transmit DTMF or fax, MOS  cid:29  3.92.  *  Mean Opinion Score, a subjective average mark given by listeners on a scale between 1 and 5.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  61  G.729a: 8 Kbit s, less computing-intensive version of G.729, MOS  cid:29  3.7 G.723.1: 6.3 or 5.3 Kbit s, MOS  cid:29  3.9 or 3.65  In noisy wireless environments, ETSI and 3GPP have been in the driving seat:  GSM-FR: Full Rate, 13 Kbit s, invented in the early 1990s but today out-  dated, MOS up to 3.2.  GSM-HR: Half Rate, 6.5 Kbit s, also from the early 1990s, MOS < 3. GSM-EFR: Enhanced Full Rate, 12.2 Kbit s, delivers wireline-like MOS   up to 4.5 in a quiet street  4.1 in-car with 10 cid:13 3 BER* .  AMR: Adaptive Multi Rate, from 4.75 to 12.2 Kbit s, adopted by 3GPP  in 1998 as the standard codec for GSM; includes GSM-EFR and IS136  EFR  the TIA variant .  AMR-WB:  AMR  Wide  Band,  50–7000Hz,  from  6.60  to  23.05  Kbit s,   designed for UMTS.  Obviously, the latter codecs are suitable for VoIP in wireless NGN and IMS.  3.6.5 NGN Signaling If the IETF deserves the title of the founder of the NGN, ITU-T deserves the title  of pioneer.  In the 1990s, ITU-T launched the ﬁrst architecture for audio and video trans- mission over an IP network, as H.323. They were the ﬁrst to adopt RTP  IETF  RFC 3550  in the media and border gateways layer. The main signaling protocol  was H.225.0, based on ISDN access protocol.  H.323 was well suited for enterprise telephony — most VoIP PBXs supported   H.323 well before SIP.  But around 2000, ITU-T failed to get suﬃcient vendor and operator attention   for BICC, the signaling protocol allowing to set up media streams.  Conveying the media streams themselves requires routing technology, some- thing  the  traditional  telephone  exchange  vendors  did  not  master  in  those  days.  Moreover, their energy was dragged away by the implementation of IETF’s SIG- TRAN  Signaling TRANsport , to carry signaling over IP networks. It became  tempting to phase out BICC until after ISUP over SIGTRAN.  The need to carry signaling over IP was so high that individual companies had  developed Reliable User Datagram Protocol  before IETF SCTP  and Extended  ISUP over IP  E-ISUP, before carrying ISUP over IETF M3UA .  The lack of adoption of ITU-T BICC opened a window of opportunity for the  IETF to initiate the Session Initiation Protocol  RFC 2543  in 1999 and clarify it  as RFC 3261 in 2002.  *  Bit Error Rate.   62  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  IETF SIP-T  RFC 3372  is a binary encapsulation of ISUP inside SIP  as a  MIME attachment , with the purpose of not losing information when transferring  calls over SIP networks. 3GPP deﬁned this as TS 29.163.  But as ITU-T ISUP was heavily modiﬁed and extended by national PTTs, which  lead to over 60 national or regional variants across the world, SIP-T is also national. A new variant, SIP-I is therefore currently under development as an interna-  tional superset of the national SIP-T variants.  The  ITU-T  Study  Group  11  is  deﬁning  a  new  encapsulation  called  Generic   Transparency Descriptor  Q.GTD.1 .  The reason for these encapsulations is that even in 2006, it is not possible for  an MGC* to map the full set of ISUP messages and parameters to basic SIP mes- sages and ﬁelds, despite all additional SIP RFCs trying to cover the most evident  holes  e.g., there’s still no originally called number, redirecting number nor privacy  indications in SIP .  Anno 2006, ITU-T ISUP, and BICC contain a superset of IETF SIP function-  ality, so the battle between bellheads and the bitheads is still raging.  3.6.6 NGN Gateway Control Also in the NGN area, in 2000, the ITU-T initiated another major and ambitious  development: an open interface between the session control layer and  initially only   the media gateways: Media Gateway Control  MEGACO, then recommendation  H.248, today H.248.1 .  Today’s version  H.248.1 version 3, 2005  includes 13 basic packages and has  over 40 optional packages to control various telecom features on circuit-to-IP media  gateways  and  IP-to-IP  border  gateways.  TISPAN  deﬁnes  Core  Border  Gateway  Functions  C-BGF, at the edge between access and core network  and Interconnec- tion Border Gateway Functions  I-BGF, interconnecting the core networks . The  general term “gateway” could be used to refer to both media and border gateways. ITU-T H.248.1 is adopted both by TISPAN  for “ﬁxed” NGNs  and by 3GPP    for the “mobile” IMS .  The physical decomposition of session plane and user plane is now even adopted  in the new generation of GSM  Phase 2 cid:11   and UMTS core networks  3GPP Release  1999 and Release 4 , where centralized MSC servers are now controlling decentral- ized media gateways. Hence ITU-T H.248 has also become one of the reasons why  IMS  3GPP Releases 5-6-7  is losing ground.  The IETF ﬁrst adopted H.248  as Megaco 1.0, RFC 3015  in 2000, but con- tinued to develop its own Media Gateway Control Protocol  MGCP, RFC 2705  superseded by RFC 3435 in 2003 .  Today we see MGCP losing ground against H.248.1, which is considered more   “open” and “extendible.”  *  Media Gateway Controller, please refer to Section 3.1.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  63  3.6.7 Transmission ITU-T played a prominent role in the worldwide standardization of digital subscriber  lines; the G series also contains the standards for ADSL and its higher speed ﬂavors. Also in the transmission layer, G.703 contains the physical electrical character- istics of any digital hierarchical interface  e.g., the DS1 system: E1 at 2 Mbit s, or  T1 at 1.5 Mbit s .  G707 708  speciﬁes  the  Synchronous  Digital  Hierarchy   SDH   for  transmis- sion over optical networks  e.g., STM-1 at 155 Mbit s, STM-16 at 2.5 Gbit s up to  STM-1024 at 159 Gbit s .  3.7 IEEE As mentioned in Section 1.7, the IEEE today plays a capital role in driving new  wireless access technologies in both unlicensed and licensed frequency bands  i.e.,  WiFi and WiMAX, respectively , to carry IP.  In  the  history  of  telecommunications,  IEEE  802.1-2004   “WiMAX”   and  802.16e-2005  “Mobile WiMAX” , with the latter written as a delta speciﬁcation on  the former, are major milestones. At the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century, these 800- page documents truly reﬂect the latest advances in radio technology, corresponding  to the OSI* model’s Layers 1  PHYsical  and Layer 2  Medium Access Control .  One could object that these are connectivity technologies rather than enabling   communication services.  But the WiMAX standards introduce a revolutionary and long-awaited Meshed  network architecture, where WiMAX Subscriber Stations  SS  are allowed to trans- mit to each other, obviously not at the same time on the same frequency. Though  there are currently also examples with WiFi Meshing, 3GPP and 3GPP2 have held  tight to the Point-to-MultiPoint  PMP  architecture, where one Base Station  BS   transmits to multiple Subscriber Stations  SS , but the SS don’t transmit to each  other.  So the IEEE WiMAX standards are worth a few words in this chapter on NGN   standards, with the humble ambition to provide a very basic overview only.  Seen from the Network Layer 3, the WiMAX MAC Layer 2, by including the  appropriate “Convergence Sublayer”  CS: the top part of the MAC  can behave as  one of the following:  An ATM Virtual Circuit  VC  An Ethernet  IEEE 802.3  Local Area Network  LAN  A Virtual LAN  IEEE 802.1Q-1998  An IP router  RFC 791, 2460   *  Open Systems Interconnection.   64  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  At the PHY layer, WiMAX is in fact a whole family of Broadband Wireless   Access  BWA  technologies:   cid:78    cid:78   WirelessMAN-SC cid:162   “Single Carrier”; Wireless MAN SCa cid:162  single car- rier advanced : in the 10 to 66 GHz frequency band, wavelength is short   3 cm to 4.5 mm , hence multipath reﬂections against buildings and the  landscape are negligible, so Line-Of-Sight transmission  LOS  is required.  The transmitter and the receiver need “see” each other. With a channel  bandwidth  of  25  MHz,  raw  data  rates  in  excess  of  120  Mbit s  can  be  obtained. In the frequency band up to 11 GHz, reﬂections are signiﬁcant, Non-Line- Of-Sight  NLOS  or near-line-of-sight operation is possible, but interfer- ence appears  i.e., receiving two signals with the same frequency from two  transmitters .  So  either  the  available  spectrum  needs  to  be  allocated  in  slices to individual operators  licensed mode , or the power at which these  operators transmit needs to be limited  unlicensed mode, primarily in the  5–6 GHz band . In the latter case also, speciﬁc collision avoidance mecha- nisms such as Dynamic frequency Selection  DFS  may be imposed by  the national regulator. Below 11 GHz, either in licensed or in unlicensed  mode, there are three options for the PHY layer: WirelessMAN-OFDM cid:162    “Orthogonal  Frequency  Division  Multiplex- ing” : OFDM is a transmission technology where, using a channel band- width BW  e.g., of 5MHz  centered around a carrier at frequency fc  e.g.,  2302.5  MHz ,  200  orthogonal  subcarriers   e.g.,  spaced  22266  Hz  from  each other  are used to transmit a set of 200 complex numbers ck during  one Symbol time Tb  1 22266 Hz  cid:29  45 μs in this case . If, for example, c13 is zero, it means that bit 13  out of 200  is zero. The 200 bits transmitted  during Tb are visually represented as a QAM* constellation  dots on a grid,  either  lit  or  dark .  Besides  these  200  frequencies,  as  256  is  the  smallest  power of 2 above 200, 56 frequencies are used as a “guard band” transmit- ting zero Voltage, in order not to interfere with the next channel  e.g., 2305  to 2310 MHz . The transmitter uses an Inverse Fourier Transform  IFT  from frequency  to time domain, in order to derive the voltage being sent to the ampliﬁer  and the antenna.  When the receiver applies a Fast Fourier Transform on the signal, it recal- culates these 200 complex numbers ck, and if they haven’t moved too  much, meaning if the QAM constellation dots were suﬃciently apart,  discovers the correct value of the 200 bits.  The bandwidth eﬃciency in this simple but realistic example is 200 bits  cid:114  22266 Hz  cid:29  4.453 Mbit s, over 5 MHz bandwidth, thus almost one bit s   *  Quadrature Amplitude Modulation.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  65  per Hertz. In real life, that value is a bit higher for downlink and lower  for uplink traﬃc, but never mind, is roughly double of what you can get  out of CDMA transmission  3GPP HSPA and 3GPP2 EVDO . WirelessMAN-OFDMA cid:162    “Orthogonal  Frequency  Division  Multiple  Access” : Here, the subcarriers  e.g., 10, adjacent or not  are grouped in  subsets  i.e., 20  named subchannels. In the uplink, several transmitters  may  transmit  simultaneously  as  long  as  they  use  diﬀerent  subchannels  e.g., 3  or other times  e.g., 4 OFDMA symbols  to transmit — hence  the name “Multiple Access.” The combination of a subchannel and time is  called a slot; in the example there are 12 slots available. In unlicensed mode below 11 GHz, WirelessHUMAN cid:162  is the term IEEE  uses to deﬁne the usage of one of the three PHY options above, plus the  speciﬁc requirements for unlicensed operation.   cid:78    cid:78   It is WirelessMAN-OFDM  licensed or not , and thus also WirelessHUMAN    unlicensed , which support both PMP and Meshed network architectures.  As for any two-way radio technology, WiMAX uplink and downlink transmis- sion either have to use diﬀerent times  TDD: Time Division Duplex  or diﬀerent  frequencies   FDD:  Frequency  Division  Duplex ;  both  modes  are  supported  in  WiMAX. GSM is only TDD and for 3G, incompatible variants have appeared:  Chinese TD-SCDMA is obviously TDD. 3GPP W-CDMA is FDD. 3GPP2 EVDO is FDD.  Besides WiMAX, and contrary to 3GPP 3GPP2, which only focuses on long  range wireless technologies, the IEEE also developed a low-power, ultra-short range   10m  wireless technology, Bluetooth  802.15.1 , to build Wireless Personal Access  Networks  WPAN  or wireless peer-to-peer networks.  The short-range wireless technologies beneﬁt from rapid and worldwide adop-  tion by the computer and peripheral manufacturers.  With  the  mobile  cellular  phone  now  a  computer,  IEEE  technologies  ﬁnd  their  way  into  these  devices,  perhaps  at  an  even  faster  pace  than  3GPP 3GPP2  technologies.  3.8 OMA The OMA was created in June 2002 in response to various organizations attempt- ing to standardize mobile data services: the WAP Forum  focused on browsing and  device provisioning protocols , the Wireless Village  dealing with instant messaging  and presence , the SyncML Consortium  for data synchronization , the Location  Interoperability Forum, the Mobile Games Interoperability Forum and the Mobile  Wireless Internet Forum. The OMA was created to gather these initiatives under a  single umbrella.   66  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  OMA is seriously addressing messaging services with the Multimedia Messag- ing Service  MMS  and Instant Messaging and Presence Service  IMPS , today  widely implemented on mobile phones, in frontal competition with IETF’s XMPP,  with Jabber and of course IM provider-speciﬁc protocols.  OMA Data Synchronization and Device Management are deﬁned using the   syncML  synchronization Markup Language .  Further, there’s a standard for mobile broadcasting  BCAST . OMA is today the best promoter of GSM GPRS UMTS mobile data services  and matching handsets, but will this model prevail over the TISPAN NGN or —  even more diﬃcult — the wide open Internet?  3.9 Summary In this chapter we started from a layered deﬁnition of the NGN, and after having  reviewed the work of the most relevant standardization organizations one by one,  we can now draw their areas of focus on that initial diagram.  In  conclusion,  though  the  standards  organizations  are  often  endorsing  each   other’s speciﬁcations, they seem to have found their place in the NGN.  Figure 3.6 Standards bodies and their domains of contribution to the layered  NGN.   Review of the Standardization Work   cid:78  67  Some  areas  get  little  attention,  such  as  Media  Resource  Function  Controllers   MRFC , Media Resource Function Points  MRFP  and Media Gateways — especially  when migrating from voice to video or new media types.  Another important no-man’s-land is the IT part  OSS, BSS and TMN ; whereas  today, 40% of the eﬀort to deploy a new service probably goes into provisioning,  billing and supervision tools and processes. Organizations that used to cover this  area, for example, the Object Management Group  OMG  with a.o. the Common  Object Request Broker Architecture  CORBA , have lost ground and momentum.  Rather than focusing on the telecom sector, they tried to be everything to everyone,  including the ﬁnancial sector.  Fortunately, the times where a diﬀerent radio access technology  GSM, CDMA   would lead to diﬀerent core network architectures and even diﬀerent VAS plat- forms, seem to be behind us. As a result of this bitter ﬁght, 3GPP and 3GPP2 lost a  lot of authority and credibility. GSM has won that battle, with 85% of subscribers  worldwide.  This has left an open space to TISPAN, to deﬁne the PSTN Emulation Sub- system  PES  and make advances in network attachment, resource and admission  control and service-based policy decisions, based on IETF  DIAMETER  and ITU   H.248  protocols.  However perhaps on a larger scale, IETF and ITU are now competing to adopt   and globalize the TISPAN standards. TISPAN seems to push toward ITU.  The battle between bitheads and bellheads is likely to be pursued for the fore-  seeable future.  And at an even greater scale, communication standards will keep competing  with powerful vendor-speciﬁc solutions at all layers of the NGN: peer-to-peer com- munication technologies, regional HD TV formats, closed instant messengers and  search engines, incompatible music and video formats, proprietary radio technolo- gies such as Flash-OFDM or WiBree.    Chapter 4 Engineering the NGN  Up  to  here,  we  have  examined  the  fundamentals  of  genuine  communication  services   Chapter  1 ,  considered  at  a  modern  service  provider’s  starting  position  Chapter 2 , and taken a tour through the landscape of NGN standards  Chapter 3 .  What does it take to become a NGN Service Provider  NGNSP ? As we’ll see in the upcoming chapters, we’ll need a way to charge our customers    Chapter 5  and a reliable VAS platform  Chapter 6 .  But here, let’s concentrate on the practical way to build a NGNSP, which should   lead us to consider some essential business aspects too.  To start quickly, we could download the SIP Express Router  SER  and SIP Express  Media Server  SEMS  from iptel.org on a Linux PC, and be ready in minutes to convey  voice and video traﬃc over IP. Let’s call our little enterprise ngvas.com.  The next step is to persuade Alice White,* our model user, to conﬁgure her IP  phone, softphone or multiplayer game to use ngvas.com as the default proxy for  outbound voice and video communications.  Would Alice submit her outgoing session initiation requests for sip:19191234567@ ngvas.com,  sip:19191234567@chicago.com  or  even  sip:carl.sandburg@chicago. com† to ngnvas.com?  How  would  Alice  know  of  the  existence  of  ngnvas.com  —  through  search  engines?  Would  her  IT  administrator  in  atlanta.com  look  for  new  VoIP  carrier   * Alice is the originating user in IETF RFC 3261 on SIP. Alice White was an American ﬁlm  actress born as Alva White  1904–1983 , who started her career in silent ﬁlms but successfully  switched to talking movies in the late 1920s, as her voice matched her screen image perfectly. † Carl Sandburg  1878–1967  was an American poet, historian and novelist who focused most  of his poetry on Chicago, praising American agriculture and industry, a. o. in his famous  poem “Chicago” in 1916.  69   70  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Figure 4.1 Alice White, actress.  reviews? Would her IT administrator even download a local softswitch from ngnvas. com, or rent some capacity through some Web Service API to ngvas.com?  More  fundamentally,  when  peer-to-peer  instant  messaging,  voice  and  video  over the Internet are free, and bandwidth is abundant, what will drive Alice  e.g.,  end users, companies, third-party software  to use centrally operated communica- tion services in the client–server model?  Should  ngvas.com  strive  to  become  a  SIP  registrar  and  SIMPLE  presence  server, allowing third parties to query Alice’s presence for inbound communica- tions, rather than establishing outbound communications?  To whom would Alice grant the permission to reveal the status information regard- ing the address sip:alice.white@atlanta.com? Would that include her location informa- tion? Would her existing Outlook calendar be synchronized with ngvas.com?  Would ngvas.com be able to oﬀer a better outbound voice and video quality  than its competitors  centrally operated or peer-to-peer ? And if so, would calling  users accept to pay a premium for it?   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  71  Figure 4.2 Carl Sandburg, poet, historian and novelist.  And if Alice is convinced to purchase outbound communication services, or to  publish her presence for inbound communications, what technical hurdles will she  or her company IT administrator face?  It  is  these  kinds  of  questions  we  need  to  tackle  in  this  chapter;  hopefully  this  example  will  lead  us  to  new  insights  in  essential  network  engineering  requirements.  Ten years ago ngvas.com could not have appeared due to the entrance fee to   purchase and operate the technical infrastructure.  Today, there’s aﬀordable technology and some solutions for 24x7 operations   e.g., hosting , but ngvas.com would most likely fail due to the complexity of Inter- net business models and commercial chains.  Up to now, network engineering has been about topography, redundancy, predict-  ing the traﬃc to be carried and dimensioning the infrastructure accordingly.   72  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Today, as the distinction between a network and a service is almost gone, “Engi-  neering the NGN” is to be interpreted in a totally diﬀerent way.  Nevertheless, in this book we still think it’s worth maintaining the distinction  between “NGN” and “VAS” even if they might be oﬀered under the same com- mercial label  ngvas.com .  4.1 Advertising and Discovery One of the reasons why communication consumers used to rely on central com- munication service providers is the addressing plan. We already mentioned this  as a strength in Section 2.1. As the service providers are mutually interconnected  in a cascade model, end users are able to communicate with a large number of  easily addressable destination users, identiﬁed by unique and permanent contact  addresses, that is, E.164 telephone numbers.  Communication consumers have a fundamental need, namely to resolve these  higher level contact addresses  URI, Uniform Resource Identiﬁers, RFC 2396  to  discover a routable IP address — either directly of the destination end user, or more  likely of a suitable border gateway, able to relay the media streams onwards to the  actual destination network or user.  Whereas for classic telephony the originating user would rely heavily on the  communication service provider as an “address translator,” the ubiquitous avail- ability of always-on IP connectivity  broadband  and the packetization of our com- munication means are changing that model. The end user today has a wide range  of options to discover the routable IP address corresponding to a buddy in a contact  list or  maybe soon  a geographic location on a map, a character in an online game,  and so on.  Domain  Name  Service  queries   DNS,  RFC  1035  and  related   may  be  per- formed to obtain host names and ﬁnally routable IP addresses for various applica- tion addresses, for genuine communications or for the transfer of stored media, for  SIP- and non-SIP based applications. A DNS server can, for a single destination  domain,  hold  diﬀerent  records*  for  SIP  and  for  other  applications   e.g.,  e-mail,  browsing .  The public DNS infrastructure has not been populated with records for SIP, but  if they wanted, ISPs could thus use that general public mechanism to direct SIP  requests from their broadband users to the NGNSP’s.  Alternatively, the ISP could allow each broadband customer to select a default  NGNSP, or even to indicate their preferred NGNSP in the SIP URI, on a per ses- sion basis  sip:carl.sandburg@chicago.com.ngvas.com .  In an even more advanced scheme, the user agent may choose to send all SIP  requests to an address resolution service  locally preconﬁgured as an IP address or   * IETF RFC 3403 deﬁnes these as the Naming Authority Pointer  NAPTR  Resource Records    RR .   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  73  a URI’* , which would respond with SIP 301 “Moved Permanently,” returning a  Contact:† leading to the actual NGNSP‡.  That SIP URI resolution service could be operated independently, or be part of  a real NGNSP  i.e., carrying media too, according to our deﬁnition in Section 3.1 . It may even be developed as a peer-to-peer SIP  P2PSIP  service, ultimately redirect-  ing the user agent’s request to the physical server responsible for the requested URI. Multiple technical options are thus available for the selection of a NGNSP. Whatever option is taken by user agents and people distributing them  we’ll  talk about distribution in the next section , the advertising and discovery of NGN  networks boils down to a quite simple question: will existing name resolution algo- rithms and processes  e.g., DNS, SIP  be able to discover the best NGNSP for a  given destination address?  Early attempts to answer this question had resulted in TRIP  Telephony Rout- ing over IP, RFC 3219, 2002 , a routing protocol to advertise the reachability of  telephony destinations  E.164 numbers and ranges , independently of the applica- tion  signaling and media  ultimately used to reach those destinations. By listening  to TRIP updates from neighbors, a NGN network element can construct a Tele- phony Routing Information Base  TRIB : a database of both internal media paths  within the IP Telephony Administrative Domain  ITAD  and external media paths  to diﬀerent ITADs.  DNS is of course the general name resolution protocol used by most Internet  applications to reach a destination address. Therefore, the IETF also undertook the  tElephone  NUmber  Mapping  eﬀort   ENUM,  RFC  3761,  2004   recommending  the use of DNS to obtain Naming Authority Pointer Resource  NAPTR  records,  containing the various URIs  e.g., Universal Resource Information for SIP, e-mail,  classic telephony, instant messaging  in order to reach a given destination telephone  number  in the format 8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.8.7.9.1.e164.arpa. .  However,  whether  we  use  TRIP  or  ENUM  to  resolve  destination  NGN  addresses, it will always result in media streams  RTP packets  being routed directly  to the ﬁnal NGNSP  recipient operator  “owning” the destination user.  Indeed, the destination-based forwarding paradigm results in the most speciﬁc  route being used. If an intermediate NGN provider has advertised to be capable  to route the entire number range  cid:11 1978XXXXXXX, but the ﬁnal NGN provider  advertises to be responsible for the range  cid:11 1978123XXXX, both TRIP and ENUM  will result in the ﬁnal NGN provider being selected.  RTP packets will thus be routed end-to-end, from the originating NGN pro- vider’s border gateway to the public IPv4 address of the ﬁnal NGN provider’s bor- der gateway, along a route discovered by IP routing protocols.  * For example, sipuriresolutionservice.com, to be resolved by public DNS. † SIP 2.0 301 Moved Permanently.

Within the IGP, distance-vector routing protocols  e.g., Routing Information  Protocol,  RIPv2,  RFC  2453   advertise  routing  information  as  the  distance  to  a  destination IP address range, but each router is unaware of the network topology.  The propagation of new routing information can be quite slow. With link-state  routing protocols  e.g., Open Shortest Path First, OSPFv2, RFC 2328 , each router  has the same link-state database describing the entire network topology of the AS:  “Autonomous System,” administrative domain . Link-State Advertisements  LSA ,  when broadcast throughout the AS, can form quite some overhead traﬃc. There- fore, both distance-vector and link-state routing protocols are not suitable on inter- AS interfaces.  The most commonly used EGP is the Border Gateway Protocol  BGP-4, origi-  nally RFC 1105, now RFC 4271, 2006 , suitable for use on inter-AS interfaces.  TRIP is based on, and very similar to BGP-4. The Autonomous Systems  AS   of BGP-4 correspond to IP Telephony Administrative Domains  ITAD  in TRIP.  Where BGP-4 lets IP routers advertise NEXT_HOPs, TRIP lets location servers   LS  advertise NextHopServers.  BGP-4 and TRIP share the same fundamental limitation: the inability for the  originating service provider to select a transit AS resp. ITAD in order to reach a desti- nation AS ITAD, if the originating service provider has received routing information  concerning the destination AS ITAD. This is of course often the case.  In summary, today it’s fair to state that NGNSPs are blind for media qual- ity metrics, and are unable to select transit NGNSPs objectively oﬀering better  media quality to reach a given destination. The existing query response proto- cols   SIP,  DNS  and  ENUM   or  telephony  routing  protocol   TRIP   could  be  used to communicate better next hops, but the oversight is missing. The result  is that media compete for bandwidth with less critical applications on the same  IP routes. The situation is comparable to what aviation must have been before the  birth of Air Traﬃc Control.  There appears thus to be a need for a new intelligent overlay, that would be  aware of the media resources, throughput and quality in the media and border  gateways layer, and able to return better next hops when queried by the session  control layer.  On a busy Friday afternoon, the media stream from Alice in Atlanta to Carl in   Chicago, and the backwards stream, should perhaps be routed like this:  Could ngvas.com also be launched as such “advertising overlay,” not conveying the   actual media streams, and not even the session establishment signaling?  It looks like an attractive perspective, but either ngvas.com would have to build  its own network of probes, permanently making test calls using various providers to  various destination domains; or, more realistically, there needs to be a mechanism    Engineering the NGN   cid:78  75  Figure 4.3 Media streams avoiding a congested zone of the Internet.  to obtain objective information from the existing NGNSPs, who in turn are relying  on IP service providers — the transport layer.  So  in  the  next  section,  let’s  start  from  what  should  be  the  ﬁrst  concerns  of  any NGN communication service provider: how to provide media throughput and  quality over third party IP networks and the public Internet?  4.2 The Quest for Throughput and Quality Much has been said about quality of service  QoS  and, as for security, these topics  are too large to be treated from a single angle.  Also, it means something else to diﬀerent parties. ISPs would think in terms of  resource reservations along an IP route, prioritizing speciﬁc IP packets within each  router, labeling packets using MPLS, providing virtual private networks, and so  forth. The 3GPP IMS, another example, promises “end-to-end” QoS enforcement    76  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks   as we reviewed in Section 3.3.2 , but assumes an IMS at either end of the com- munication and no intermediate service providers. End users would probably think  of “uptime” when talking about quality of service.  Let’s go through a list of questions to ﬁgure out what NGNSP’s should target   when talking about quality.  Will NGNSP’s take a defensive attitude, and let their softswitches interrogate  some local TISPAN Resource and Admission Control Subsystem  the RACS we  discussed in Section 3.5  to verify whether there’s enough bandwidth to establish  the session the customer wants?  Would that be based on the proposed media type  oﬀered SDP  or, better, on   the negotiated one?  Could the NGNSP then, after SDP negotiation, simply refuse to establish the  session — what release cause should be invented for this and will the end customers  accept this?  Or should the NGNSP, over a given IP access bandwidth, try and demonstrate  better end-to-end media quality  voice and video  than ISPs currently calculating  the best IP route, by calculating the best media path? That would be the pro-active  strategy.  Who can rightfully  both commercially and technically  claim to know the   better next hop for media and other applications?  Is it the same best next hop for all applications, or could it be the NGNSP con- trolling the best media resources toward a list of speciﬁc destination domains, as  measured via RTCP XR?  Real-Time Control Protocol’s eXtended Reports, IETF  RFC 3611, brieﬂy mentioned in Section 3.2.2   Our hope is that the best next hop will not only be a discount NGNSP oﬀering  the lowest price regardless of quality, or a super virtual private network with the  best quality at an unaﬀordable price. There will be a wide palette of opportunities  between the extremes, if there’s an objective and independent way to assess a qual- ity increase above best eﬀort.  Will specialization occur, with some NGN providers guaranteeing bandwidth  for   video , vs. others oﬀering the lowest round trip delay and packet loss rate  for voice ?  These are the questions we would need to investigate before positioning and   launching ngvas.com, our little NGNSP.  Intuitively, one can imagine that by diverting media  and real-time applications  in general  to less occupied IP routes than the ones calculated by the ISPs, some  aspects of media quality could be improved.  Peer-to-peer applications, which according to ISPs today account for 50 to 75% of  all traﬃc on the Internet, have demonstrated that by splitting a single media stream  over multiple peer relays, and recombining the streams at the receiving end, better  throughput and quality could be obtained. Besides for genuine communication ser- vices, peer-to-peer networks are also better at distributing stored content  ﬁle shar- ing . In fact, peer-to-peer networks are currently “eating” the bandwidth originally  deployed to be used by client-server applications such as browsing or email.   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  77  Can  the  NGN,  essentially  using  client-server  protocols  and  not  splitting  up   media streams, ﬁght the peer-to-peer phenomenon?  Not today, that’s our impression, not in the present state of the standards. But better times might be ahead. We introduced H.248 in Section 3.6.6. In 2004, ITU-T standardized an H.248  package allowing the media and border gateways to communicate the RTCP XR  measurements to a higher layer: the ITU H.248.30 package. With this package,  objective  measurements  can  be  collected  either  per  segment,  or  for  an  end-to- end media path, but also subjective metrics: the estimated Mean Opinion Scores   MOS  which end users would have granted, for Listening Quality  MOSLQ  and  Conversational Quality  MOSCQ .  Other H.248 packages allow the gateways to report on congestion  H.248.10,   H.248.32 , overload  H.248.11  or jitter buﬀer metrics  H.248.31 .  RTCP XR measurements could eventually be obtained from a network of inde- pendent test call emulators using H.248.30 to report, but then the other H.248  packages would not be covered.  Similar metrics can be used to assess video quality. Selected friendly users could also be invited to report on quality, during or after   each call, and be rewarded for this.  Imagine that it would be the Meshed Mobile WiMAX* Subscriber Stations   SS  doing the RTCP XR measurements — the metrics would constantly change  as the SS would move around. It would become a computing-intensive job, that’s  for sure.  Communication buyers — initially the NGNSPs themselves, maybe later the  end users — are thus going to be looking for independent organizations receiving  this information, exchanging it peer-to-peer, analyzing it in detail and delivering  independent, objective routing advice, as fast as possible.  Within such framework, the “advertising overlay,” NGNSPs should also be able  to communicate on other aspects such as price, available total capacity, network  roll-out plans or current number of customers.  The idea is thus a “stock exchange” for NGN communication services. The common goal should be to beat peer-to-peer media conveyers, not by bar- ring their port numbers in ﬁrewalls or sabotaging their traﬃc in other ways, but  through an objectively and subjectively better service. A tough battle for ngvas.com, our little NGNSP. The  idea  for  networks  to  advertise  their  quality  through  standard  protocols  is not new. It was originally the case in GSM international roaming, for exam- ple, where the visited networks would announce the minimum radio signal level   RxLevMin  a mobile would need to receive from that network, in order to have  a decent quality voice conversation. If multiple networks would be available, the  mobile handset would select the network it received the best, if that network had   *  The WirelessMAN-OFDM cid:162  with IP Convergence Sublayer – please refer to Section 3.7.   78  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  not announced a too high RxLevMin compared to the actually measured reception  level. At similar reception levels, the handset would opt for the network announc- ing the lowest RxLevMin.  The ﬁrst thing that happened is that all operators started putting RxLevMin at  the minimum value in order to capture inbound roamers, even when call quality  would not be OK. Who would these visiting roamers call to complain anyway?  The network selection system was later further torpedoed using Over-The-Air   OTA  provisioning, over SMS, to populate the Preferred Networks list in your  SIM card.  Today when you go roaming out abroad, the selected network is rarely the fruit  of hazard or objective quality considerations. Either the visited operator will be cho- sen within the same multinational operator group, or in other cases there’s a bilat- eral commercial preference agreement beyond the standard roaming agreement.  The lesson to be learned is that in the long term, communication service provid-  ers cannot be trusted to announce objective network quality.  Probably similarly, public companies could not be trusted to announce correct   ﬁnancial reports to the stock exchange.  Even when it would be operated independently from start, the “communica- tion means advertising overlay” is thus likely to evolve from resembling a Stock  Exchange, to a Securities and Exchange Commission.  4.3 Distribution Once advertised  perhaps through an independent organization and peer-to-peer  network   and  ensured   in  terms  of  throughput  and  quality ,  a  service  must  be  distributed.  Today’s IM, voice and video providers are using a simple business model: make  your  user  agent  free  for  downloads,  use  a  proprietary  protocol  and  addressing  scheme, build up a captive community and let your advertisers pay for the band- width being consumed by your central servers. “Don’t worry about quality; your  end users are captive.” Sure?  The business model of an NGNSP, using standards, will be very diﬀerent. User agents will be downloaded for free and most likely not be controlled by  the NGN providers at all; remember Section 1.6. Most likely, user agents will also  built into other applications such as navigation, gaming or in-car entertainment.  Device manufacturers will continue worrying about the forces of the global con- sumer electronics market, and be unable to predict whether the SIP user agents will  be installed on video camera’s, in cell phones or in home theatres. It’s not a matter  of unwillingness.  The  distribution  of  basic  NGN  service  could  thus  become  a  thin,  subtle process. Even existing and well-established IM, voice or video providers could add  the standards to their existing software clients, and let consumers choose between    Engineering the NGN   cid:78  79  peer-to-peer, non standard and standard client-server mode of operation. Given the  quality metrics we discussed in Section 4.2, the client could take its own decisions,  or rely on an independent third party.  There will probably also be no relationship possible between the connectivity  service provider and the communication service provider; the idea to convince ISPs  to direct all SIP requests from their broadband users to a selected NGNSP is ﬂawed.  As there’s no regulator imposing to implement some kind of carrier selection, any  agreement would have to be commercially negotiated. But with competition from  free peer-to-peer networks, could NGNSP’s pay the ISPs enough to do so? Com- mercially, can the ISP ask or even impose its customers to select a NGNSP?  The situation is similar to GSM service distribution in advanced markets. The  GSM service provider in most cases still provides a radio network, a core network and  some basic services such as voicemail or roaming — even though the engineering and  daily operations are today being outsourced to the vendors of these networks.  The commercial distribution is moving from a retail model to wholesale. It is  outsourced to a very capillary network of franchise holders and distribution chains,  even increasingly using their own brand. There’s a semantic debate on when such  reseller becomes a “Mobile Virtual Network Operator”; some say it’s enough to  oﬀer your own self-care Website, others claim you should be operating own bill- ing system and prepaid VAS platform, or even distributing your own Subscriber  Identity Modules  SIM . For sure, resellers have been able to deﬁne their own tariﬀ  plans since the launch of GSM in the early 1990s.  A similar commercial distribution model is to be expected for basic NGN ser- vice; perhaps the distinction between retail and wholesale will disappear. Anyway  it will be hard to tell the diﬀerence.  As for mobile cell phone service, the demand for NGN communication services  will most likely start in the upper enterprise segments — a retail model very close  to wholesale.  Open source PBX’s, hosted PBX services and desktop conferencing tools are  today conﬁned within a single enterprise or even enterprise site. When these islands  of IP will start communicating, that is, along the customer-vendor supply chain,  there will be the need for protocol and media conversions, for address analysis and  routing,  for  network-based  message  stores,  and  so  on  —  for  NGN VAS  service  providers. The TDM-to-IP migrations in the enterprise segment are also laying the  foundation for tomorrow’s demand for large-screen video and hi-ﬁ quality audio   telepresence .  As for cell phones, NGN technology and the demand for media quality will  spread from the board room to the work ﬂoor, from enterprise to residential usage,  from VoIP telephones and PCs to the other devices, and ﬁnally from the online  world to oﬀ-line content downloads.  In 2006, the ﬁrst digital media kiosks have appeared at airports and in stores. Cable  operators  are  demonstrating  loyalty  to  the  IETF  and  TISPAN  NGN   standards, at least in the telephony part of their triple-play oﬀers.   80  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  The media industry, and more speciﬁcally broadcasting, is heading for a major  clash with the telcos and ISPs if it doesn’t embrace these standards in the early  digital TV and radio deployments.  Before selecting a retail or wholesale strategy for ngvas.com, or even focusing on  the corporate enterprise segment, let’s therefore consider an important aspect of the  oﬀer: is ngvas.com going to oﬀer outbound or inbound communications?  4.4 Outbound Communications Today’s public networks and the Internet allow reaching almost any destination  number or address on the planet.  This has been realized through almost a century of carrier interconnections,   and twenty years of Internet service provider peering.  Conveying these communications over IP, using an NGN infrastructure and  possibly an advertising overlay to improve the quality and availability, may sound as  a good plan toward countries well-connected to the Internet. But there will always  be these hard-to-reach Internet destinations, which could easily deteriorate the per- ceived overall quality oﬀered by the NGN provider, certainly in the business and  corporate communication markets.  Media  gateway  operators,  providing  the  packet-to-circuit  conversion  toward  these countries  in fact, today’s international voice carriers , should of course also be  able to advertise their termination services on the peer-to-peer overlay. They should  then provide the same media quality metrics and advice-of-charge information as  the “IP-only” NGN providers.  In fact, many multinational enterprises are today using such international voice  carrier, even for internal calls, which could be carried over the enterprise’s “own” IP  backbone. Enterprise PBX users are today forced to dial 9 or 0 to get an outside line,  often to the local media gateway, and as soon as they do, their PBX is incapable of  recognizing that the destination is internal  but on the other side of the world .  By switching from a “carrying” to an “advisory overlay” role, the international  carriers could start using these corporate IP backbones to carry media streams. On  circuit-switching PBX sites, the media gateways converting circuits to packets could  be operated by the carrier. The sites where IP telephony is introduced  i.e., where a  commercial or open source IP PBX is deployed to replace the legacy PBX  can be  used as a transit points for signaling and media.  With the necessary security precautions, and under responsibility of a trusted  NGNSP, the media streams of enterprise A could even make use of the softswitches  and media relays of enterprise B, and vice versa.  Initially both enterprises A and B should probably be customers of a single NGNSP;   later, NGN peering agreements will appear between competing NGNSPs.  One can see a scheme where not only service providers and carriers, but also   enterprises are rewarded for their contribution to the NGN maze.   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  81  In order to realize that vision, we are facing the same limitation, namely, that  today’s IETF and TISPAN standards do not allow to properly advertise the avail- ability, quality and price of media resources.  In conclusion of this little section, using enterprise IP networks to convey out- bound communications sounds original and ngvas.com could specialize in turning  enterprise telephony networks into NGN communication service providers; ﬁrst for  their internal use; later maybe as part of a larger federation.  4.5 Inbound Communications Perhaps without noticing, we have looked at NGN advertising, media quality and  distribution from the angle of outbound communications.  In the 1980s, International Voice Carriers  IVC  started their business by pro- viding outbound international and long distance telephony service to enterprises.  The  incumbent  PTT  would  continue  to  deliver  the  inbound  calls  to  the  E.164  numbers, that is, over ISDN Primary Rate Interfaces  PRI  to the PBX.  Throughout  the  1990s,  even  through  new  access  technologies  appeared  to  bridge the last mile  e.g., microwave transmission , and the carriers were rolling  out their metropolitan, national and international glass ﬁber loops, the intercon- nect revenues the alternative carriers could receive would not justify handling the  inbound communications to the enterprises. Besides transmission, the cost of the  digital telephony exchanges  switching  would also be a show stopper.  Competitive  Local  Exchange  Carriers   CLEC   and  Local  Number  Portabil- ity  LNP  were introduced by the US Telecommunications Act of 1996. But even  then, CLECs would have to lease digital exchange capacity from the Incumbent  LEC  ILEC  and thus would not be able to introduce lower-cost switching technol- ogy  NGN . Local Loop Unbundling  LLU  — where a CLEC only has to lease  naked copper pairs from the ILEC — was only introduced in the early 2000s in  advanced markets  2003 in the U.S. .  LLU  and  DSL  standardization  have  permitted  the  emergence  of  aﬀordable  broadband IP connectivity, together with new access technologies such as Cable,  WiFi and WiMAX.  Now residential users and businesses can enjoy aﬀordable broadband IP access,  and with the emergence of VoIP technology and devices, new providers are taking a  fresh look at inbound communication handling. The telephony interconnect revenue  is low per minute, and the cost of interconnection is not negligible, but the avail- able broadband capacity for VoIP termination is high. The added value is high too:  call centers can now be centralized and located anywhere, taking inbound calls col- lected on local E.164 numbers in dozens of countries. And the opportunity to provide presence-based VAS is looming — the basic force we discussed in Section 1.8.  Hence a new type of communication service provider has appeared in the mid- 2000s: the Inbound Communications Handler  ICH , operating TDM-to-VoIP    82  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  media gateways, or leasing them from the International Voice Carriers  IVC, who  were already using them in the other direction anyway .  ICH  can  either  apply  for  their  own  slice  of  E.164  numbers,  comparable  to   CLECs, or start porting in local numbers from the ILECs or CLECs.  By the end of the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century, maybe under pres- sure of unlicensed broadband mobile connectivity  Mobile WiMAX, IEEE 802.16e- 2005 , we can also expect licensed broadband mobile connectivity  3GPP HSPA and  3GPP2 EVDO  to become more reliable and aﬀordable — including when roaming  abroad. ICH will then be able to terminate voice and video calls to mobile devices — a  privilege today reserved to licensed mobile operators.  Will  3G-only  connectivity  service  providers  end  up  teaming  with  the  ICH,  in their battle for market share against the mixed 2G-3G service providers and  their 2G amortized networks? Or will the future Mobile WiMAX ISPs come to an  agreement with the ICH? The general trend is to split connectivity service provid- ers from communication service providers, but equal-to-equal partnerships will be  possible.  In markets where the called mobile user pays for ﬁxed-to-mobile calls  mainly in  the U.S. , ICH should see a healthy stream of revenue straight from the called user. Elsewhere, where the calling party pays, revenue will come from the intercon- nection. In fact, in such market, an ICH could attempt to reward the receiver of  inbound communications  individual or enterprise  with part of the interconnect  revenue. ILEC and CLEC don’t do this today; on the contrary, enterprises need to  pay monthly ISDN PRI rental fees to receive inbound calls. Some mobile service  providers do reward their users for receiving calls from other networks. The NGN  ICH play looks quite good; could our little ngvas.com be started as one?  The ILEC has the regulatory obligation to terminate calls to any national geo- graphic number range assigned to, or numbers ported to the CLEC, and in this  case to the specialized ICH. And the ILEC of course pays the call drop-oﬀ charges   call set-up fee and price per minute  to the CLEC ICH, as speciﬁed by a national  reference interconnection oﬀer. Even the interconnection infrastructure to termi- nate these calls  leased lines  is, according to most regulation, fully at the expense of  the ILEC; conversely, trunk groups being used for CLEC-to-ILEC calls are entirely  at the charge of the CLEC.  By 2008–10, many regulators and ILEC are expected to introduce VoIP inter- connections as a cost-eﬀective alternative the E1 T1 leased lines — a loss of revenue  for the ILEC’s transmission wholesale department.  Worse, as a new cost, the ILEC will incur the costs of media gateways perform- ing the circuit-to-VoIP conversion for a while, as long as many calls keep being  originated in circuit-switched mode.  Regulators and service providers have some hard work ahead, extending today’s  circuit-switched  Reference  Interconnection  Oﬀers  to  the  packetized  world,  thus  transforming them into NGN peering agreements. This brings us to the subject of our next section.   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  83  4.6 NGN Peering TDM*   circuit-switched   communication  networks  have  been  interconnected. Bilateral interconnection agreements have been set up between the communication  service providers  CSP . Without going into too much detail, these bilateral agree- ments are based on a connection fee per call, and a price per time unit. CSP X is  charged by CSP Y to connect outbound calls  X to Y  to a given destination  e.g.,  Lebanon . And CSP X is also charged by CSP Y for inbound calls  Y to X  to free- phone numbers, or when CSP Y provides the physical access network allowing to  select CSP Y as a carrier. Inter-operator accounting is based on call detail records,  which are generated for every call. At the end of the month, the net amount due by  CSP X to CSP Y  or vice versa  is calculated, in a process called “settlement.”  Internet Service Providers  ISPs, “Autonomous Systems” in Internet standard  terms  are however establishing peering agreements. Originally, ISPs would use  settlement-free peering, reﬂecting the fact that traﬃc was symmetrical and both  parties would automatically beneﬁt from peering.  This is no longer the case. In a laconic recommendation D.50 approved in Montreal  in 2000, the ITU-T spoke of commercial agreements taking into account the traﬃc  ﬂow†, the number of reachable destinations‡ and even the “geographical coverage”§ as  elements of the compensation, even when the actual transmission  the leased line  would  already have been paid for 100% by the new ISP or country. In practice, it meant that  small countries wishing to connect to a large public Internet eXchange Point  IXP, often  in the United States  could be dismissed with a high oﬀer, whereas most of that IP traﬃc   browsing, e-mail  would actually be routed to servers outside of the United States.  Contrary to TDM interconnection, the principles of ISP peering were thus  left to be organized by each national regulator  for public peering — many little  ISPs, low capacity , but most often by the private sector  private peering — high-  capacity peering between the larger ISPs . Today, most of the Internet traﬃc occurs  at private peering points, often implemented as third party “carrier hotels.”  A starting pure NGNSP will thus have to go through multiple stages to obtain  Internet access: ﬁrst probably commercial broadband Internet access, then public  peering, and then private peering over time — unless of course the NGNSP teams  up from the start with a large ISP.  NGN peering is the interconnection of session-based networks. A session has a  duration but is essentially set up to transport a certain volume of data  megabits .  Will NGN peering then follow the principles of TDM interconnection  mainly  time-based , or of ISP peering  volume, number of reachable destinations, etc. ?  * Time-Division Multiplexed. † But what traﬃc ﬂow: the estimated rate in Megabit s or the actually measured rate? The aver-  age rate or the peak rate? Based on which formula? The principles out there are numerous.   ‡ IP routes, reachable DNS domains, etc. § The number of square miles of the country?   84  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  It’s a  very diﬃcult question. Today’s NGN are mainly rolled out by incum- bent ﬁxed telephony providers  the ex-PTTs  for PSTN emulation  see Section 3.5   — they automatically think in terms of connection fees and duration. However,  often they also have an ISP division, which thinks in terms of Megabit s and desti- nations. And greenﬁeld NGNSPs come and knock at the ISP door ﬁrst. What will  they then charge their peer NGNSP’s?  If greenﬁeld NGN providers do not start charging per minute, that is, because  the general trend is to oﬀer ﬂat-fee, all-you-can-eat models, there will be no way  for them to close TDM interconnection agreements to drop oﬀ outbound traﬃc  to E.164 numbers or to purchase this traﬃc from international carriers. Greenﬁeld  NGN providers would thus have to focus on inbound calls for a while, for example,  to mobile devices as we saw in Section 4.5.  Perhaps greenﬁeld NGNSP’s should simply not oﬀer the E.164 telephone num- bering  scheme  at  all.  Alice  could  only  sip*  Cal  Sandburg  at  sip:carl.sandburg@ chicago.com, eventually relayed by the biloxi.com domain.  Seen from the other angle, if the “ex-PSTN” NGN providers do not start peer- ing based on volumes  and other parameters  instead of minutes, they will not be  able to oﬀer more advanced SIP-based end user services such as video-on-demand,  and will continue to emulate the PSTN only.  There’s a need for TDM interconnection and ISP peering agreements to con-  verge to a new type of agreement, the NGN peering agreement.  In general, a new NGNSP needs to be the following:  Interconnected to existing TDM Core Networks of ﬁxed, mobile ser- vice providers and long-distance carriers, via Media Gateway Controllers   MGC  and Media Gateways  MGW† . The all-IP MGC  i.e., speaking  ISUP over SIGTRAN  is connected to the TDM  SS7  networks via a  Signaling GateWay  SGW . Service providers refer to the entire conver- sion of NGNs to TDM as “TDM trunking.” In fact, as real-life NGNs  are less monolithic than what the standardization organizations describe   Figure 3.1 , trunking sometimes ends up being performed and operated  by separate, dedicated organizations that have already deployed SGW and  MGW in diﬀerent countries, and are operating central MGC. Trunking  is country-speciﬁc and relies on a very diﬀerent skill set than deploying  next generation networks: ITU-T or ANSI SS7 point codes, national SS7  ISUP ﬂavors, SS7-to-SIGTRAN signaling gateways, transcoding, E1 or  T1 leased lines, ﬁxed operator licenses, interconnection agreements, in- country local premises or hosting, and so on. If the NGNSP decides to  outsource TDM trunking, he will need to peer with his TDM trunking  providers via IP  SIP and RTP .  * Yes, we’ll have to start using this verb in a totally diﬀerent context. † These are referred to as Trunking Gateways  TGW  in the TISPAN standards.   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  85  Interconnected  to  existing  TDM  Access  Networks,  using  TDM-to- NGN conversion units which the ﬁrst NGNSP’s have called CSLAMs*  or MSANs.† TISPAN  see Section 3.5  deﬁned them as Access GateWays   AGW ,  located  at  the  NGNSPs  PSTN  Emulation  Subsystem   PES .  These  units  provide  analog  lines,  ISDN  basic primary  rate  interfaces  and or V5 interfaces  toward remote subscriber units  to residential end  users and enterprises; and they speak the NGN language  SIP and RTP   to the NGN core. They are today outside of the scope of IETF and 3GPP  standardization, but widely available. Again, the question is whether the  new NGN provider would operate those himself or peer with specialized  TDM access providers via IP  SIP and RTP .  Peered with IP Access Networks such as DSL, cable, or WiMAX, through  which SIP signaling and RTP media ﬂow directly to the User Agents,  over IP; the combination of such next generation Access Network and  Core Network is sometimes referred to as the “All IP network.” The layer- 2 connectivity to the end user  e.g., PPPoE: Point-to-Point Protocol over  Ethernet, carrying IP  is oﬀered by Broadband Remote Access Servers   BRAS  — the last element of the access network.  Peered with Enterprise IP Networks, either already operating their own  IP PBX, or using media gateways in front of their circuit-switched PBX.  These media gateways were originally deployed by the enterprises,‡ but  there’s a trend to outsource this to the NGNSP§. In another scenario, the  NGNSP operates a shared “IP Centrex” service platform, to which diﬀer- ent companies’ user agents  ﬁxed and wireless IP phones, user agents on  laptops, WiFi PDAs, etc. , are registering via SIP or the more feature-rich   but Cisco-speciﬁc  SKINNY Client Control Protocol  SCCP . We men- tioned this as an interesting opportunity back in Section 2.3. It is then  up to the IP Centrex service provider to keep “Berlin Walls” between  the user data of diﬀerent enterprises. However, many communications  between users of diﬀerent enterprises could be routed locally within the  IP Centrex platform — that’s a beneﬁt.  Peered with other NGNSPs, including long-distance VoIP carriers. The  name of the game here is currently “least cost routing,” but this could  rapidly evolve to “known quality routing.” The new Service provider.  It  is  very  likely  that  specialized  TDM  trunking  providers  and  TDM  access  providers, or at least dedicated Business Units, will appear over the next 5–10 years.  Investing in circuit-to-packet gateways only, without the costs and risks of an NGN   * Combined Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers. † Multi-Service Access Nodes. ‡ Thus to be considered as a TISPAN Residential GateWay  RGW . § Thus to be considered as a TISPAN AGW.   86  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  core network and its set of VAS platforms, is actually a very attractive business  model for today’s IXCs* and ILECs.  If that happens, new NGNSP’s will be able to use the same NGN peering equip- ment, processes and contracts with TDM trunking providers, TDM access provid- ers, IP access networks, enterprise IP networks and other NGNSPs.  The key equipment you need for NGN peering is a Session Border Controller   SBC . According to the TISPAN deﬁnitions we reviewed in Section 3.5, an SBC  performs both the I-BCF and the I-BGF, at the edge between the core network and  other NGNSP’s. At the edge between access and core networks, TISPAN deﬁnes  the SBC as performing the P-CSCF and CBGF.  But, following the idea of generic NGN peering equipment, there’s no reason to   distinguish these two SBC deployment cases anymore.  In an open world, there’s no reason to consider the access network “trusted” and   peer NGNSPs as “untrusted.”  The User Agents accessing the NGN Core Network  end users in an IP Access  Network or an Enterprise IP Network; an SBC or SIP proxy server in a peer NGN   may never be “trusted”:  They might be tempted to set up a session and disconnect it immediately,  only to discover the RTP ports, and continue to exchange media on these  ports for a longer period, after the end of the initial short session.  They might be tempted to pass payload  text, images or even audio and  video  within the signaling messages; SIP is a very extensible protocol  and this is perhaps also its weakness.  They might try and discover the network topology, to launch malicious  attacks such as SIP Denial-of-Service  attempting to set up a huge num- ber of SIP sessions without ever actually completing any .  Session Border Control  4.7 The  Session  Border  Controller   SBC   is  the  element  that  allows  an  NGNSP  to  securely interconnect their core network to access networks, IP-enabled enterprises  and peer NGNSP.  It is thus the instrument by excellence to realize NGN peering — well, at least   the Session Control and the Border Gateways layers.  Ideally, an SBC should be decomposed into a Border Control Function  BCF   in the session control layer, and a border gateway  BGW  in the media and border  gateways layer, interconnected via the ITU-T H.248.1 gateway control protocol. We  looked at that architecture back in Section 3.1, and at the protocol in Section 3.6.6.  * International  eXchange  Carriers,  operating  circuit-switched  international  exchanges,  and   well-interconnected to ILECs and CLECs.   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  87  The SBC plays important roles: media cut-through, NAT traversal for signal- ing, media stream latching, topology hiding, transcoding, admission control and  more than a dozen other functions.  As most of the functions rely on tight integration between the BCF and the BGW,  there’s today a technico-commercial debate on whether the BCF should reside inside the  NGN core network softswitch  a server , or may be colocated with the BGW  a router .  4.7.1 Media Cut-Through As soon as third-party IP-based networks need to be connected to an NGN or IMS,  thus in the latter three cases of the previous section, an SBC is required to prevent  media transfer outside of correctly established, chargeable SIP sessions.  More precisely, during session set-up, early media  ring-tones etc  may already  be  received  by  the  session  originator.  The  ring  tones  may  be  generated  by  the  responding user agent or by the network  e.g., by a media server . But the forward  audio  and video  channels should be opened only when a SIP 200 OK message is  received from the responding user agent.  This process is called “media cut-through” and is the SBC’s primary task.  4.7.2 NAT Traversal for Signaling A second role of the SBC is to help SIP sessions to be established through enterprise  FireWalls  FW  and Network Address Translators  NAT .  Diﬀerent types of NAT exist, but the most commonly used form is symmetric  NAT, in which all requests from the same internal  private  IP address and port to a  speciﬁc destination IP address and port are mapped to a unique external  public or  private*  source IP address and port. If the same internal host sends a packet with the  same source address and port to a diﬀerent destination, a diﬀerent mapping is used. With Simple Traversal of UDP through NAT  STUN , a user agent inside the  enterprise environment  containing a STUN client  can ask a STUN server on the  external network to tell him what the external address of the NAT is, and what  port was opened by the NAT to allow incoming traﬃc back in to the network.  Obviously, the STUN server needs to be colocated with the NGN operator’s SBC.  Otherwise, the symmetric NAT will allocate diﬀerent external ports for the STUN  query as for the upcoming SIP request.  The originating user agent can then use that STUN response to ﬁll in the IP  address in the From: ﬁeld of the outbound SIP INVITE  or other message . This  will allow the ﬁrst SIP proxy  the service provider’s SBC in this case  to return SIP  responses to the originating user agent, via the NAT’s external address and port.  * The NGN provider may, on the interconnection to a corporate network, have obtained an  address from the private address space of that corporate network. An entire private address  space may even be used on the interconnection only, with NAT functions both on the service  provider and the enterprise side.   88  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  For secure communication to the NGN’s SIP proxy, the originating user agent may   eventually encrypt that outbound SIP INVITE message using IP secure  IPSec .  If no IPSec is used, the enterprise Firewall‘s Application-Level Gateway  ALG   for SIP is able to look at the requested RTP ports for media, and may open them  on-the-ﬂy — whereas normally they are kept securely closed.  If IPSec is used, the enterprise ALG is unable to decrypt the SIP message, so it  cannot open RTP ports on-the-ﬂy. The originating user agents must thus use RTP  ports which are preconﬁgured as open on the Firewall. If the enterprise’s IT depart- ment is not willing to leave dedicated ports open, IPsec will have to be sacriﬁced.  While STUN allows an originating user agent on an enterprise LAN to set up  outbound SIP sessions through a NAT, clearly it doesn’t allow the external world   the NGNSP in this case  to set up an inbound session to that SIP user agent. The  port  on the external side of the NAT  on which SIP INVITEs should be received  keeps changing, whenever the user agent obtains a diﬀerent internal IP address, via  Dynamic Host Control Protocol  DHCP . In most enterprise networks, new IP  addresses are allocated every couple of days.  Traversal Using Relay NAT  TURN  is a principle that allows the SIP User  Agent to obtain a permanent external address and port from a TURN server on the  external network, at which the UA can then be contacted.  From the description above, it would sound as if SIP user agents should absolutely  perform a STUN or TURN query before registering to an NGN and announcing  their Contact: address, or would otherwise be unreachable when in the enterprise  environment. STUN and TURN servers should reside inside the SBC that is going  to be used to deliver that inbound communication. Otherwise the information is  unreliable, certainly if the enterprise has multiple NAT boxes and ISPs.  As most SIP user agents are today still shipping without STUN TURN cli- ent, this issue could hamper the deployment of the NGN itself, until each of these  devices can be allocated a permanent  static  IPv6 address.  The situation is not that dramatic. Today’s smart SBC’s work in Application-Level Gateway  ALG  mode, for user  agents unable to perform the STUN TURN queries. These smart SBC’s automati- cally translate the periodic SIP registration requests to include the temporary exter- nal address and port on the NAT box.  If the SBC notices that the user agent’s IP address is frequently changing  in SIP  registrations and session initiation requests , thus that the external address and port  allocated by the NAT are unreliable, the SBC will even insert one of its own perma- nent IP addresses and ports in the SIP registration, and act as the TURN server.  4.7.3 Media Stream Latching All the above helps the SIP signaling to ﬂow in the two directions, between user  agents behind NAT and an NGN. How about the media streams themselves?   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  89  When an originating user agent sets up a session  SIP INVITE , it includes its  own address as the Origin  “o cid:29 ” parameter  of the Session Description Protocol   SDP  oﬀer. If it hasn’t performed any STUN TURN query, that address is inter- nal, unreachable by the NGNSP, for downstream media toward that user agent. If  the user agent did the STN TURN query, the address in there might be good. In  general, from the NGNSP’s perspective, it is thus unreliable.  Media latching is a principle whereby the SBC ignores that address information  in SDP, but monitors the source IP address and port of the upstream RTP packets,  in order to determine the destination IP address and port of downstream RTP pack- ets. It is a continuous process, not only occurring just after session establishment.  To speak in TISPAN and H.248 terms, the Border Control Function  BCF   should be able to instruct the Border Gateway Function  BGF  to ignore the address  it sends in the H.248.1 ADD request, but to rely on media stream latching instead.  Topology Hiding  4.7.4 An SBC should also include a Topology Hiding Internetwork Gateway  THIG .  This function makes sure that the list of hosts through which the SIP request is  proxied  in the Via: and Record-route: headers  is erased from the SIP header before  sending out the message to the outside world  untrusted or trusted access network,  enterprise or peer network .  This protects the NGN from Denial-of-Service  DoS  and Distributed Denial- of-Service  DDoS  attacks that could be set up against the NGN core network  elements and VAS platforms.  Transcoding  4.7.5 As  mentioned  in  Section  3.6,  the  ITU-T  and  ETSI 3GPP  have  deﬁned  several  audio and voice encoding formats.  We looked at some of them back in Section 3.6.4. The SBC is ideally placed to transcode the formats into each other. For example,  optimal audio quality might be realizable with the G.711 codec  64 Kbit s  on the  NGN provider’s own backbone, but a good quality price ratio might be obtained  from long-distance providers using G.723.1 at 5.3 or at 6.3 Kbit s.  Ideally, the SBC would also perform transcoding for video formats and media  types other than voice. For example, today 3G circuit-switched video calls use the  H.324M codec, whereas most “ﬁxed” SIP-based video sessions use the H.263  or  H.264 codec. If mobile users wished to participate in enterprise video sessions one  day, transcoding would be required.  Transrating  is  the  process  to  adapt  the  packetization  interval  —  for  example,  from 20 ms of encoded voice in the RTP payload, to two RTP packets of 10 ms each.  Indeed, the standards organizations, national regulators, service providers and enter- prises do not always seem to have come to compatible choices in that area either.   90  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  4.7.6 Admission Control SBC’s are also the ideal place to limit the total number of sessions being admitted from  a given source domain, in order to protect the NGN core network from overﬂow.  In a network with multiple SBC’s across the globe, it becomes diﬃcult for these  SBC’s to share a common set of real-time counters, representing the total number of  ongoing sessions to from a given NGN peer, enterprise or application service provider. Hence as we saw in Section 3.5, the more recent view is that the SBC, more spe- ciﬁcally its interconnection border control function  I-BCF , should query a central  Admission and Resource Control layer  RACS .  Indeed, the RACS has an overview of the total number of sessions going on  in  the  whole  network,  and  can  take  into  account  the  various  interconnection  agreements.  The need for admission control is also related to the need for overload protec-  tion; we’ll look at that in Section 6.11.  4.7.7 Other Functions The SBC is such an important and strategically positioned new element in a NGN  architecture that new functions keep being added to it:  Lawful Interception  LI , where certain media streams need to be inter-  cepted and copied to the law enforcement agencies  Virtual Local Area Network  VLAN  tagging, allowing it, for example, to   carry signaling and payload on separate VLANs  Quality-of-Service  QoS  marking QoS and ﬂow statistics reporting Bandwidth policing, probably by querying the TISPAN RACS we saw in   Section 3.5  Echo Canceling DTMF interworking between multiple methods, in-band* and out-of-band† SIP security, screening the use of SIP messages, header ﬁelds and values, for   each interconnected peer NGN or enterprise  Accounting Least-cost routing Service assurance Reporting on media quality  Some of the functions  e.g., QoS marking  rely on tightening the bonds between   the media and border gateways layer and the IP transport layer.  * Using RTP payload or RFC 2833. † Using either SIP INFO or NOTIFY messages.   Engineering the NGN   cid:78  91  Leading suppliers and more than a dozen start-up companies have succeeded to  build and commercialize these platforms, which are now commonly considered as  the “edge routers” and “ﬁrewalls” of Next Generation Networks.  4.8 ASP Interconnections In the past, various standards had been proposed to open a service provider’s net- work to third party Application Service Providers  ASP .  More speciﬁcally, the standards bodies launched open Application Program- ming Interfaces  API’s  that could be oﬀered to ASP’s, allowing them to use the  Service Capabilities  “the bottom part”  of the VAS platforms.  The common point of these standards  e.g., Java J2EE, Parlay, Parlay X, OMA   is that they are very focused on the mechanics of call control, but overlooked essen- tial aspects such as subscription  which ASP may interact with which user , inter- operator  accounting   how  would  revenue  be  shared   or  media   who  would  play  announcements, ring tones, videos, etc. .  Therefore,  they  appeared  to  be  very  unsuccessful  at  opening  up  PSTN  and   GSM networks to developer communities.  In the future, VAS platforms may of course be further developed to oﬀer access to  their service capabilities, by third party ASP’s, for charging or content delivery pur- poses. We’ll take a look at this strategy in Sections 5.12 and 6.18, respectively.  On the other hand, GSM service providers have been successful at building  up  a  network  of  premium  SMS  service  providers   e.g.,  SMS  “Large  Accounts,”  “Short Codes”  via pretty basic TCP IP protocols*. These SMS service providers  are semi-trustable; constant monitoring is required to protect the GSM end users  from fraud, scams and spam.  Can the NGN be opened up in a similarly simple way, but including better   security, in order to connect more ASPs in the long term?  When SMPP was conceived, the GSM network was not accessible by IP. But fundamentally, in an NGN, where IP access is ubiquitous, is there still a   reason to make a distinction between an end user and an ASP?  End users are, for example, admitted to a 3GPP IMS based after ISIM authenti-  cation and authorization based on a proﬁle held in the HSS  see Section 3.3.2 .  And as we saw in the previous section, enterprises, access networks, and peer   NGNSP will be admitted to the NGN core network by SBCs.  If we want to avoid developing yet another access method, besides end user  access  via IMS P-CSCF  and SBCs  TISPAN I-BCF , should ASPs then be treated  as end users, or as peer networks?  * For example, Short Message Peer to Peer, developed by a little Irish company Aldiscon, later   acquired by Logica, now LogicaCMG; in 1999, SMPP was handed over to the SMS forum.   92  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Of course, ASPs are in a special position. Contrary to peer NGNSP’s, ASP’s are  proposing their services to the NGNSP’s subscribers  e.g., individuals, enterprises .  ASPs will have speciﬁc requirements such as the possibility to do the following:  Oﬀer free services to the end user, services which are then perhaps funded  by advertisement or other business models  see also Section 5.6  or other- wise announce the price of an item to the end user  Section 5.7   Obtain the end user’s agreement Check an end user’s account state, and perhaps reserve funds, prior to deliv-  ering the service or item  Assess whether the service or item was properly delivered Debit the user’s account when this is the case, and notify the end user Request the NGNSP to waive other charges associated with the delivery  i.e., the   charge for the transported volume in Megabits, associated to a game level   Include ASP services in the NGNSP’s product catalog, so the end user bill   or online log  would contain an accurate description of the services ren- dered and items purchased  Participate  in  the  NGNSP’s  subscription,  lawful  intercept  and  customer   care processes  The requirements go far beyond the mechanics of session control and media   Therefore, ASPs should be treated as interconnection partners rather than end   injection.  users.  End users should continue to be authenticated and granted access via standard   mechanisms  e.g., SIP, IMS , not “polluted” by ASP requirements.  The NGNSP should oﬀer an open interface on their BSS. That new, online,  transaction-based BSS not only needs to charge for end user communications, but  should become a BSS for Wholesale, ASP and Enterprise billing. These third par- ties should obtain a secure API to perform the account management and charging  interactions listed above  e.g., check an account state, reserve funds .  As for the delivery of the content, the ASP should set up a session via the I-BCF,  the top part of the SBC which will already provide security, bandwidth policing  and other functions. That I-BCF may now need to link to the BSS in real time, to  inform the BSS of successful service delivery.  In summary and according to Figure 4.4, ASPs could be granted access to the   following:  The  Service  Capabilities  sublayer  of  the  Application  Servers,  which  would oﬀer the same capabilities to third party applications as to the  NGNSP’s own applications; this method requires further development  well  beyond  the  current  standards;  we’ll  also  mention  this  need  for    Engineering the NGN   cid:78  93  openness in Section 6.18, when we’ll list the requirements for VAS plat- forms in general  The NGNSP’s Billing Support System  BSS , via an online API oﬀering  the ASP access to account management and charging operations, also in  a secure, subscription-aware manner; we’ll look at this in a wider context  in Section 5.12  The Session Control layer  namely, the TISPAN I-BCF from Section 3.5 ,  where ASP’s can accept and set up sessions to the NGNSP’s end custom- ers, subject to access control and resource allocation by the NGNSP’s  Resource and Admission Control plane  The Media and Border Gateways layer  more speciﬁcally, the TISPAN I- BGF , where they can inject media such as audio, video, Web sessions, in  a controlled and metered way  And if these capabilities are developed for the ASPs, nothing would prevent  an enterprise to beneﬁt from them, for example, to obtain a real-time view on  the upcoming next invoice, to create new end users, organize them into separate  accounts,  or  to  order  new  services  —  or,  to  take  an  example  involving  session   O  O  Figure 4.4 Wholesale  and  retail  charging  for  NGN  services  and  methods  to  open the NGN to third-party Application Service Providers  ASPs .   94  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  control, resource control, and border gateways, to set up an executive video com- munication to the employees.

We started from a long list of questions to be answered in the business plan of   ngvas.com, our hypothetical little NGNSP.  We discussed the need for NGNSPs to advertise their media quality and price  toward certain destinations, hence to be automatically discovered by other NGNSPs  and end users, in a worldwide jungle of competitors.  This  situation  calls  for  an  advertising  overlay,  an  independent  organization  in  which the quality metrics and price information could be exchanged in real time —  the “stock exchange” function of the NGN.  With business models moving from retail to wholesale, NGNSPs will have  to use a new form of subtle, thin distribution, which boils down to convincing  the  established  IM  players  to  add  the  standard  protocols  in  their  client  soft- ware. Indeed, blunt linking of an IM client or device to a given service provider  — linking iPods to iTunes — will not be tolerated by the market much longer. An idea for diﬀerentiation is for NGNSPs to focus either on outbound commu- nications  thus charge end users and enterprises , or on inbound communications   thus live from interconnect revenue only .  The cornerstone of each NGN strategy should be NGN peering, rather than  TDM  interconnection.  TDM  trunking  and  access  are  best  left  to  specialized  players — probably today’s ILECs and IXCs.  A new, dedicated network element has appeared for this purpose — the Session   Border Controller.  SBCs could also play a role in allowing third party Application Service Provid-  ers to be interconnected to the NGN, though other methods exist.  Considering the blurred distinction between ASP and other peer NGNSP, and  the need for a uniform wholesale charging policy for both third party NGNSPs and  ASPs, the SBCs are also the best option to interconnect ASPs.  Finally, the ASP requirements we examined in this chapter are a ﬁrst indication  that we should take a closer look at the charging and rating requirements for new  communication means, which is the topic of our next Chapter 5.  After that, we’ll take a dive into the technical architecture of VAS platforms, to   engineer the Service layer properly in Chapter 6.   Chapter 5 Charging and Rating  Requirements for New  Communication Means  As the CFO of our ngvas.com NGNSP would say, of course it is required to develop  tariﬀ plans and payment methods, for either true communication services or for the  transmission of stored media.  But tariﬀ plans alone should not become the primary concern of a communica- tion service provider’s marketing department. The excess of creativity in this area  results in a general sentiment of unfairness and alienation, rather than in a trusted  and valued brand. The initial early adopters do not switch to the new tariﬀ plans,  promotions and payment methods, and feel left behind.  And the name of the game is customer ownership. Once this high quality cus- tomer relationship is created  the “account” , several services may be sold through  it:  connectivity,  communication  services,  and  even  content,  physical  goods  and  other services than communication.  Inventing  and  implementing  charging  and  billing  schemes  for  too  many  of   these could eventually again turn into a digression.  The purpose of this chapter is not to make a sterile overview of charging and  rating systems used by today’s communication service providers, nor to try and  compare them or provide migration advice. The fact that the world is moving to  real-time rather than batch processing, for example, is an example.  Let’s ﬁrst try and build a set of essential deﬁnitions, and then examine the likelihood  for future communication means to require a product catalog, charging, rating, meter- ing, advice of charge, redirection, billing, promotions, openness and or correlation.  95   96  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  5.1 Product Catalog Since the mid 1990s, mobile service providers have multiplied the number of new  “product” oﬀers — merely corresponding to handset subsidies and tariﬀ plans, rather  than to packages of value-added services. It is as if petrol companies would have sub- sidized new cars, and invented various packages containing a monthly mileage or a  number of gallons of fuel. Plus a higher price per extra gallon, plus a more expensive  rate if you would ﬁll your tank at competing petrol stations  roaming .  New, more competitive product oﬀers were launched to grab extra market share,  without inviting the earlier subscribers to migrate from the old products. This cre- ated a situation with sometimes more than 100 tariﬀ plans on a single network.  In such an environment, it is impossible to launch any new service to the existing  subscriber base. Any new service oﬀer results in doubling the number of products, as  each product now exists in a version without and with the new service.  A well-structured product catalog should be at the heart of any modern com- munications company. All processes within a communication service provider  rat- ing, charging, billing but also marketing, retail and customer care  depend on it,  and should interact with it in real time. The accuracy and quality of these processes  will depend on the quality of the product catalog.  From experience, communication service providers have converged to the following  elementary object model of a product catalog. Single-headed arrows represent one-to- many integrity relationships, double-headed arrows are many-to-many relationships:  Commercial  Channel  Product  Type  Individual  Option  User  Wallet  Figure 5.1 A simple object model of a product catalog.   Charging and Rating Requirements   cid:78  97  A product catalog deﬁnes the oﬀer to the end user, in terms of product types    basic and advanced services  and additional individual options.  The product catalog needs to include information on the compatibility of these  individual options  mutual and with the product types . This is illustrated by the  many-to-many  relationship  between  product  types  and  individual  options.  One  product type may include multiple individual options, but a particular option may  occur in several product types.  The product catalog  product types and options  could be diﬀerent for each  commercial  channel  —  each  organization   e.g.,  residential business  division,  reseller,  internal  test  lab   selling  communication  services  to  the  end  users,  even  if technically all channels are hosted in a single environment. Such system is also  called “multitenant.”  However, having a dedicated product type for a single customer could be one  bridge too far, even toward a large corporate organization. It is then probably better  to grant tailored discounts, or maybe promotional rates for on-net communications  inside a virtual private network.  Typically, the tariﬀ being applied  e.g., activation fees, periodic subscription fees,  source-destination combination*, measurement unit†, initial charge, subsequent charge  per unit  will depend on the combination of all objects in the product catalog:  By which commercial channel was this user acquired? Which product type did the user select  e.g., gold, silver, vip ? What individual options did the user subscribe to  e.g., a promotional mes-  saging bundle ?  Which wallet is the user currently using  e.g., an company’s shared wallet   in the daytime, or an individual wallet at night — see Section 5.2 ?  It is thus wrong to attach a tariﬀ plan only to a Product Type.  Over time, a product catalog is a living database and should therefore be fully  versioned, indicating the date and time of start and end  past and future dates  of  each aspect of the oﬀer, however tiny. When any oﬀer ends  product type, option , it  should specify the new oﬀer by which it is replaced  and to which users are thus going  to be migrated . This is often forgotten in the design of basic charging systems.  How complex should a product catalog become? In marketing terms, we are  looking  for  the  perfect  match  between  a  limited  number  of  appropriately  posi- tioned products   cid:11  price, place and promotion  for each customer segment  deﬁned  based on their usage of the communication means . Besides the limited number of  products  e.g., Silver, Gold and VIP , additional individual options may be pur- chased or simply selected by the customer  e.g., an insurance for the cell phone, a  favorite destination country, or friends and family numbers with lower rates .  * From my home zone to a premium rate video site. † Seconds, minutes, megabits, Web pages, game levels, and so on.   98  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Within communication service providers, but in general within many commercial  organizations, there’s a diﬃcult equilibrium to be found between the mix of product  types and the tailoring options. Having too many product types and no individual  options usually has a greater impact on the organization  in terms of complexity, cost,  training, etc  than having too few product types and too many options.  Ideally,  the  product  catalog  should  regularly  be  compared  to  the  subscriber  database  in  order  to  detect  and  suppress  unpopular  product  types  and  options,  hence to simplify the oﬀer toward the end user. We’ll talk about this in the context  of reporting  Section 6.25 .  In the peer-to-peer world, the product catalog should be part of the user interface   or at least of some central Web site explaining the oﬀer to the peer-to-peer users.  Subscribers and prepaid users of telecom services used to have a lifecycle: preuse,  active, dormant, suspended, fraudulent, porting out pending, and so on — please  refer to the Section 6.2 on user accounts. Any lifecycle should not also include the  current state but the history and future planned states, as of precise dates and time.  A new evolution is that product catalogs are evolving to include a lifecycle and  renewal policy also for the product type and for the individual options.  For example, the user subscribing to the cell phone insurance could select to  have this personal option starting on the ﬁrst day of the next month. The option  could  be  automatically  renewed  each  month  if  there  are  suﬃcient  funds  in  the  account, or the system could automatically ask for conﬁrmation prior to renewing  that option, or the user could opt for a scheme in which the option is suppressed  after one month — for example to buy the insurance only to go on holidays.  The tariﬀ implications of that renewal policy is an area that is going to be devel-  oped in the coming years.  5.2 Account  cid:29  User  cid:11  Wallet An account is a term for a customer relationship with an end user of communica- tion  means,  but  may  also  be  used  w.r.t.  a  revenue  sharing  partner   e.g.,  carrier,  roaming partner, application service provider .  Some communication users could demand multiple accounts, even for the same  communication events. For example, corporate organizations today want to look  at their end users and usage by division, by country, by communications product  and worldwide.  The degree of trust should determine the prepaid or postpaid nature of such  account, more than type of user or partner. For example, when NGNSP will have  thousands of NGN peering relationships, we expect prepaid accounts to appear  also for  what is today called  inter-operator accounting.  What is stored in such account is credit, expressed either in monetary or in non- monetary balances  e.g., minutes, megabits . The balances in an account may be of  the debit type  positive values, “prepaid”  or credit type  negative values, “postpaid” .    Charging and Rating Requirements   cid:78  99  Limited credit and single-use  non-rechargeable  balances are the two other types. An  account will thus never be 100% prepaid or 100% postpaid.  A single balance may be organized in multiple buckets of credit, each with a dif- ferent validity date  after which the credit is suppressed  or future installment date   as of which the credit becomes usable . A balance thus has no expiration date; it is  the bucket which has it.  A good idea is also to group multiple balances into a wallet. An end user could  use credit from multiple wallets: a shared company wallet for business communi- cations in the day time, a shared family wallet for international calls to a favorite  destination, and a personal wallet for all other calls, for example. The wallet to be  used could be determined either by the end user or by the communication service  provider, based on the service being used, the destination, time of the week, and so  on: a real “wallet usage policy.”  What kind of data will we ﬁnd in the user’s proﬁle? In there, for end users as  well as partners, we will ﬁnd the user’s identiﬁcation and contact details, the history  or customer care contacts, the lifecycle data, links to purchased options  with their  own lifecycles and renewal policies , preferred destinations  e.g., friends and family   and negotiated discounts.  As the user and the wallet together determine the tariﬀ being applied, besides of  course the commercial channel and individual options which nevertheless have less  eﬀect, the combination of a user and a wallet forms a valid deﬁnition of an account.  An account is thus not only a user having selected a product type and options, nor   only a wallet full of balances and buckets  credit . It is encompassing both aspects.  An account is also not to be confused with a payment channel. Multiple pay- ment channels  an invoicing address, a credit card authorization, a scratch voucher,  a bank-to-mobile transfer, etc.  could indeed be used to settle a bill or top-up a wal- let. A scratch voucher could for example be used to settle a postpaid bill.  Mobile operators used to implement the user account databases as “Operator  Support Systems”  OSS  on one side and “Prepaid Intelligent Network” systems on  the other, but there’s no reason to make such distinction. A generic “accounts sys- tem” would do, and could even be used for reseller dealer accounts, inter-operator  accounting and application service providers.  Are the options speciﬁc to a user? Today they are, but one could imagine options  on the wallets too. In that sense it is a more future-proof idea to link new options  to an account rather than to a user or partner proﬁle.  5.3 Charging Charging is the process through which the network delivering the communications  service is interacting with the system holding the accounts.  In theory, the network should interact with a charging system, which in turn  should tap from an accounts system, which would ﬁnally consult a product catalog.    100  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  In practice it is not easy to deﬁne open interfaces between these, so the three func- tions should remain combined in a same “charging system.”  The timeliness and speed of this interaction is described in terms as “real-time,”  “hot,” “warm,” “cold,” but the truly important distinction is “online” versus “oﬀ-line.” In online charging, the network consults the charging system prior to delivering   the service, and asks for permission and for credit  in nonmonetary units .  In oﬀ-line charging, the network informs the charging system that the service   just got delivered.  Historically  the  online  approach  has  been  more  suitable  for  user  charging   retail ,  as  it  avoided  any  fraud  in  conjunction  with  prepaid  payment  methods.  With oﬀ-line charging, prepaid services could be delivered while the charging sys- tem would notice afterwards that the balance was too low to pay for these. The  services  calling, texting  would then have to be deprovisioned in the network, and  reprovisioned after top-up.  And the oﬀ-line approach was preferred for inter-operator accounting  whole- sale , as the network could pass more information to the charging system  trunk  group being used for the outbound or inbound call  than through the online charg- ing interfaces.  This has lead to a few industrial camps and matching departments within the  operators: “Service Nodes”   “Prepaid IN” for online charging; and “Billing Media- tion”  cid:11  “Billing Support Systems” for oﬀ-line charging.  Today there’s no technical nor economic justiﬁcation anymore to use oﬀ-line  charging for postpaid  contract  users — except maybe risk sharing. Online charg- ing systems can and should charge every user whether prepaid, postpaid, credit  limited postpaid or single use  e.g., a calling card .  The  online  charging  approach  remains  the  ideal  target  method  if  it  could   address inter-operator accounting.  However, today we see little evidence that the online charging interface of the   next generation network will support this.  5.4 Rating Rating is the process of letting the charging process interact with the accounts system  and the product catalog to determine the price of a communications event.  In general, it happens within the communication service provider’s online or  oﬀ-line charging system. Alternatively, a third party could perform rating if it has  its own product catalog  see Section 5.12  but let’s for the moment set aside this  possibility. All interaction between the network and the charging process is based  on nonmonetary units.  As an online oﬀ-line charging process, a product catalog or an accounts data- base cannot be described in a generic way, it is also diﬃcult to describe the rating  process.   Charging and Rating Requirements   cid:78  101  For online charging, at some point the charging process reserves a slice of credit  out of a balance  or multiple balances in a cascade  — a process known as credit  slicing. Ideally, the slice of credit is small enough to permit multiple simultaneous  services to be delivered with that balance, but large enough not to lead to too fre- quent charging interaction with the network. The charging process needs to consult  the account’s product type in order to know which balance cascade to tap from.  If the balance is monetary, inverse rating takes place: the inverse rating process  consults the product catalog and determines the total price or the price per unit of  the communication event. It transforms the credit slice from monetary to nonmon- etary units.  Let’s stress that, if all balances were expressed in minutes, no inverse rating   would occur in order to charge online for calls!  If credit reservation took place, the online charging process then allocates the  number of nonmonetary units  e.g., seconds, megabits, clicks  to the network or just  gives an acknowledgement  “go” signal . In some implementations of time-based  charging, the online charging system just gives a go signal but does not instruct the  network to meter the seconds. It runs its own timer and will either tap more credit  out of the wallet, or interrupt the call if there’s no credit anymore.  The oﬀ-line charging process usually does not acknowledge the request for deb- iting. Rating may occur immediately or much later: looking up the service in the  product catalog and transforming nonmonetary into monetary units.  For oﬀ-line charging as for online charging, the charging process ends up debit-  ing  lowering  the balance  monetary or not .  In conclusion, oﬀ-line charging uses rating, and online charging uses inverse   rating, only if the balance is monetary.  If, in a NGN, online charging thus became possible for inter-operator account- ing, and all balances were expressed in nonmonetary units, no rating would be  required anymore!  5.5 Metering As described above, the online charging process may allocate the number of non- monetary units to the network.  Usually these used to be the seconds granted by a prepaid IN system  i.e., an   online charging process  to a Mobile Switching Center  MSC .  In the last 5 years, however, advanced metering devices have been developed that  are able to meter the seconds, kilobits or number of clicks for a wide palette of services  and destinations, even within a single mobile data session.  Upon establishment of such session, the metering device retrieves the palette  of services to be metered, for a given user, from a central Authorization server. The  metering device is also informed whether online or oﬀ-line charging is to be applied  for each service and or destination. Some services destinations could be marked as    102  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  forbidden  black-listed  or sabotaged  gray-listed; e.g., competitors’ applications .  Also, it is made aware what to do with traﬃc that cannot be recognized as being  part of any service destination  “background traﬃc” .  In the coming years, the palette of services to be metered should probably be  merged into a single product catalog. Too often, the deﬁnition of available data ser- vices have remained separate from the main voice and messaging product catalog. If the background traﬃc requires online charging, the metering device obtains   a credit slice from the online charging system.  When the user partner accesses a service destination deﬁned in the palette, the  metering device obtains credit  sometimes also referred to as “quota” in this con- text  from the online charging system, or produces tickets for oﬀ-line charging.  Highly  granular  metering  is  thus  required  for  both  interaction  with  online   charging systems, as well as for oﬀ-line charging.  It is sometimes referred to as “content charging” but that’s an inaccurate descrip- tion, as content can be charged without metering, by applications  end points  tap- ping directly from the account  see Section 5.12 on openness .  5.6 Reverse Charging Most users understand the principle of a toll-free  800  number: the call is free to  the caller because it’s fully paid by the called party.  The decision for the charging system to allocate the charges to the content ser- vice provider  the freephone number owner in this case  used to be simple  namely  based on the called number range .  That is changing in modern communication services. Let’s consider the example of an online game where the game itself is charged  per new downloaded game level, and normal GPRS volume charges apply for the  nondownload traﬃc.  The metering device is smart enough  or instructed  not to take into account the  game level downloading packets to calculate the volume of the background session —  and to modify the background session to become time-based when using WiFi.  If a new game level download succeeds, it is charged to the end user as a unit   price.  If  the  user  had  already  successfully  downloaded  that  game  but  later  lost  or  erased it, the game level can be restored and the gaming user pays only for volume  charges — except when on WiFi.  If, however, a game level download is incomplete or unsuccessful, the volume  corresponding to that failed download should be charged to the game provider.  Again, except when on WiFi.  This small example illustrates that charging decisions are far from being static,  and that the communication service provider’s charging processes should be in full  control of normal vs. reverse charging.   Charging and Rating Requirements   cid:78  103  5.7 Advice of Charge As the complexity of the product catalog and account structure increases, so does  the need for clear Advice of Charge  AoC  to the end user, and sometimes explicit  acknowledgement or even additional authentication, in advance of actually deliver- ing the service.  In  PSTN,  toll  exchanges  completing  premium  rate  calls  are  able  to  inform  the originating local exchange of the tariﬀ in real time  through signaling . The  originating local exchange can then inform payphones of the charges to be applied  16 KHz pulses .  In some countries it is a legal requirement to inform the customer of the tariﬀ  of premium rate calls, premium SMS, or to inform the caller that the destination  number is ported out  with a warning beep .  Metering devices are also able to redirect the mobile data request to an AoC   page, or to insert the AoC information in the downlink content.  What  will  be  the  price  of  SIP  sessions  to  various  destination  domains,   Increasingly  for  data  services  and  next  generation  services,  the  operator  will  be held accountable for informing the users and partners of costs, in advance of  delivering the actual service.  In the NGN standards there’s currently no sign of an AoC facility. Early adopters won’t bother, but cost conscious users might hesitate to use the   worldwide?  services.  5.8 Redirection As mentioned above, mobile data users are sometimes redirected to AoC pages or  popup windows and may explicitly need to agree.  In case the metering device does not obtain credit for a service to be charged  online, or in case the service is barred, it should be able to redirect the user to  an explanation page  autonomously or under instruction of the online charging  process .  If  the  problem  is  an  empty  purse,  the  user  should  be  invited  to  top-up  the   credit, and in case of bad debt, to pay the bills.  Maybe in some extreme cases, redirection to a human CRM agent  via text,   voice or video call  would help?  Billing  5.9 Billing is the process of producing a bill, an invoice.  The input for billing is a set of rated CDRs  i.e., already containing a price    coming out of the charging processes.   104  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Today, most operators generate invoices for only postpaid accounts  charged in  oﬀ-line mode . Prepaid subscribers can get an invoice for top-up events  e.g., for  vouchers  but not for usage  calls, messages .  But there’s no technical reason to link the production of a bill to the charging  mode — that is, billing should be possible in case of online charging too. Prepaid  services could appear on an invoice, that is, to allow the customer to pay VAT only  on usage, rather than today on the facial value of the top-up vouchers. Top-up  vouchers could then be sold without VAT, to customers having a veriﬁed billing  relationship  name and address .  As for product types and lifecycles, one can wonder whether bills should not be   produced regarding a wallet, rather than regarding a user or partner.  5.10 Payment The payment methods should not be imposed by the bill. It should be perfectly pos- sible to settle a postpaid bill using a prepaid scratch voucher, ATM reload or bank- to-account or inter-account credit transfer — whereas these payment methods are  today considered only to top up prepaid accounts.  As for some public utility services, the customer could be proposed the option  to  pay  a  monthly  ﬁxed  amount,  to  even  out  consumption  peaks.  The  monthly  amount would be recalculated annually.  As  for  tax  payments  in  some  countries,  the  customer  could  be  invited  to  make advance payments in return for lower rates or bonuses  see Section 5.11 on  promotions .  Credit notes should be issued to correct billing mistakes — nobody’s perfect. Customers and partners having real payment problems should be converted to   prepaid or at least limited credit accounts.  Bills, credit notes and payments should be tracked in a ledger closely linked to   the account, for customer care reasons.  tion service provider’s CRM department.  Payment chasing represents today roughly one third of an average communica-  5.11 Promotions Promotions can be granted upon subscription, upon usage and upon payment.  In  the  early  stages  of  the  development  of  a  communication  service,  when  it  is important for service providers to grab new users as fast as possible and churn  doesn’t matter, promotions are mainly granted upon subscription. In more mature  markets, service usage and payments  e.g., top-up of prepaid account  are taken into  account to stimulate loyalty and reduce churn among the most proﬁtable users.  Promotion systems calculate the eligibility of end users and partners, based on  multiple factors  e.g., address, lifecycle, usage, top-up behavior , but knowing the    Charging and Rating Requirements   cid:78  105  customer segments certainly helps. It is of no use to grant free MMSs to the Silver  Cynics; they’d, however, very much appreciate free texts to their grandchildren.  The system ends up applying a promotional action: moving the account up the  ladder in a loyalty scheme  e.g., from Gold to VIP in a frequent caller program ,  granting bonus credit in the wallets, and so on. Please note that it is often the wallet  receiving this promotion, not the user partner itself.  A promotion loses its eﬀect if the users of the wallet are not informed in near  real-time of it. Granting a bonus at the end of the month will have only a minor  eﬀect on loyalty.  In most cases, but certainly if a promotion is granted upon subscription to a  service, loyalty can be greatly improved by not granting the whole reward at once.  Credit bonuses can be spread over time as “periodic credit installments”  e.g., one  free SMS a day for the coming month .  It is important to be able to simulate a promotional campaign in advance of  actually  launching  it.  Too  often,  communication  service  providers  launch  cam- paigns with meager eligibility criteria, to unclear segments  too many people  and  granting an insigniﬁcant or inappropriate beneﬁt.  Promotions can be used as a tool to steer end users toward more proﬁtable behav- ior, for example to use e-vouchers rather than scratch vouchers to top-up their pre- paid wallets, or to top-up with larger amounts rather than frequent small amounts.  5.12 Openness Much has been said and written regarding the edge between mobile operators and  ﬁnancial institutions.  Operations on a mobile account  e.g., topping up a prepaid account using a  scratch voucher  are for example subject to VAT, contrary to a bank account. A  communications invoice is sent to you including VAT.  M-commerce has been touted as the possibility for the mobile communications  consumers, using their mobile account, to purchase various services and goods,  other than mobile communications and content, sometimes forgetting about these  VAT issues.  Gradually, the mobile service providers realized that by opening up that “purse”  for a competitive fee  meaning at the level with credit card fees , they would face  competing services being oﬀered by these third parties directly to their own sub- scriber base.  We looked at this from a technical angle in Section 4.8. Premium SMS and MMS  short messages and multimedia messages to short  codes  have been oﬀered as means for third party application service providers to  “tap”  debit funds  from the user’s prepaid mobile account, or to add items on the  postpaid bill. It is a case of bundled selling, where the mobile service providers do  not wish to oﬀer access to the purse  the payment method  without a message being  carried over their networks  the communication means and connectivity .   106  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  If the payment method was oﬀered stand-alone, then premium SMS  e.g., tel- evoting, games, gambling  could be displaced by SMS to normal numbers  plus  access by the ASP to the account . Or worse, the SMS service itself could entirely  disappear  and  be  replaced  by  IP-based  communication  means  such  as  e-mail,  instant messaging or Web browsing.  Simpay .org , an initiative of 4 large mobile service providers to open the mobile  users’ purse to third parties, probably failed when these providers realized they would  open the door to competing communication services that wouldn’t use the mobile  infrastructure anymore, or at least not in the same way  maybe still as bitpipes .  MMS  is  already  being  oﬀered  for  free*  by  independent  MMS  Centers  out  there on the wide open Internet, in the hope that users of these MMSCs will start  using other services such as blogging, online albums, photo printing, or T-shirt  printing.  Oﬀering a stand-alone payment method could create a virtuous circle of higher  revenue and lower margins, but open access to accounts has become Pandora’s Box  for many service providers — nobody dares to open it.  In the Internet† and credit card space, various players are trying to convince end  users to establish a prepaid e-wallet, to be topped up using a credit card, or using  funds transferred from another e-wallet.  Dedicated  payment  service  providers   PSP   now  allow  application  users  to   choose from a wide palette of diﬀerent payment methods.  Besides within telecom operators and Internet service providers, we have pre- or  postpaid accounts at banks, credit card companies, public utility companies, leas- ing companies, cable TV distributors, electronic purses on plastic cards, and so on.  In the same line of thoughts as for the personal contact lists and tribe memberships   Section 1.9 , we will soon need shared and compatible repositories for all these  accounts.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  communication  service  providers  will  play  this  federating role.  There’s  another  reason  for  communication  service  providers  to  be  skeptical   about open charging interfaces for M-commerce activities.  As communication service providers cannot complete the communications to  all destinations themselves, intermediate carriers will be involved, and there will  always be the possibility for these third parties to use the communication means  itself as a payment method for an application. In many cases, there will be no need  for a dedicated charging interface  i.e., to the BSS , separate from the communica- tions interface  i.e., to the I-BCF or even P-CSCF .  An example of this is the use of SkypeOut credit, which is normally used to set  up calls to non-Skype destinations. Upon entrance to a public parking lot, a customer  could key in his Skype login credentials  login, password , and the merchant  the  parking company in this case  would use the Skype API to set up a virtual call from   * Well, for the price of the connectivity  the Megabits of mobile data . † For example, Paypal, eBay’s online payment method.   Charging and Rating Requirements   cid:78  107  the customer’s Skype ID to a mobile number owned by a payment service provider   PSP , for example, for 10 minutes in order to pay for every hour of parking. The PSP  would receive interconnect revenue, and kick back a number of cents  e.g., 5 cents a  minute  to the merchant  the parking company .  A similar scheme could be deployed by NGN service providers; the destination  PSP would be interconnected to the NGNSP via a SIP interface. A new technical  interface  protocol standard  is thus not required. The parking lot example shows  that charging to certain destinations should be units-based  e.g., sip:50eurocents@ psp.ngvas.com  rather than time- or volume-based.  NGNSP could  should!  deﬁne higher payout rates for sessions to these PSP  destinations. This matter is also linked to the question whether, in general, applica- tion service providers should be treated as end users or peer NGNs  Section 4.8 .  Economically, on a charging interface, PSP would expect access to the NGNSP  customer’s purse at competitive fees, comparable to credit card fees  below 5% cost  to the merchant . For a purchase amount of 100, this means a pay-out rate of 97  from the NGNSP to the PSP, followed by a kick-back of 95 from the PSP to the  merchant.  The use of communication means as payment methods is not a new phenome- non in Next Generation Networks. Many Internet sites are now relying on premium  calls and SMS  well-established communication means  as a charging method rather  than as the content delivery channel. Users are invited to call premium numbers,  send and or receive premium SMS in order to obtain access to the site.  The  vulnerability  comes  from  malicious  applications  that  would,  using  the  customer’s identiﬁcation credentials  login and password , consume the communi- cations credit without the customer knowing. In the era of dial-up Internet access,  dialers would use the computer’s modem to dial toll numbers. This threat became  more stringent in NGN, where a dialer could force the local user agent to make  even more invisible outbound calls over IP interfaces. Is it the NGNSP’s duty to  protect its end users from these security risks?  It would be of no use to develop a new, dedicated, highly secure charging API  if the communications API can be broken. Security needs to be a concern on all  interfaces, and the instruments to realize this are ﬁrewalls and session border con- trol  Section 4.7 .  5.13 Conclusion For new communication means, it is of course a diﬃcult exercise to evaluate the  charging requirements in general.  The requirements could be diﬀerent for retail mode vs. wholesale charging, or  toward other revenue sharing parties. But for sure, huge cost savings can arise from  hosting these processes in a single environment  product catalog, charging, rating  logic, etc. .   108  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  A next generation communication service could certainly be launched on the  basis of pure functionality only, with Skype as school example — well, at least  before SkypeOut was added.  However, oﬀering a new communication service in a sustainable fashion will  require the appropriate dose of attention for each of the aspects of charging and  rating. A reasonable shopping list could include the following:  A single, solid product catalog, well balanced between a limited set of prod-  uct types and an extensive set of individual options  An account which is the sum of a user proﬁle and a wallet, with a wallet  usage policy allowing a single user to tap into multiple wallets, and shared  wallets among corporations, families and the tribes of Section 1.11.2  In general, online charging whenever possible, oﬀ-line charging as second   Limited need for rating, by using nonmonetary credit in the wallets  e.g.,   Highly granular metering, to be preferred over blind openness to third   choice  seconds, megabits, clicks   party applications  Reverse charging where necessary and fair to the service user Clear, real-time Advice of Charge at least toward end users Redirection to top-up and bill payment pages A more ﬂexible payments policy, allowing to use multiple payment chan- nels independently of the pre- or postpaid nature of an account  anyway,  a single wallet could contain both pre- and postpaid credit   A well-thought promotions and loyalty strategy, after the initial growth phase   Chapter 6 Technical Requirements  for a Modern  VAS Platform  Along the years, communication service providers and their suppliers have accu- mulated  quite  some  valuable  experience  to  develop,  test,  operate,  supervise  and  maintain Value-Added Services  VAS .  Independently of these VAS, they found some common basic principles and recur- ring requirements, some of which  e.g., high availability, scalability  are also applica- ble to the NGN core network itself, and even to certain access network elements.  Wherever it is delivered  e.g., in an access network, core network, VAS platform,  billing system  a “Value-Added Service” can best be considered as an “application”  surrounded by “enablers”: besides the solid layered VAS platform itself  hardware  servers,  software  architecture ,  also  surrounding  enablers  such  as  training,  well- documented operational procedures, data warehousing, ﬁnancial supervision and  targeted marketing, which all have great eﬀects on the quality and success of any  communication service.  Some Service Providers would therefore consider a VAS platform to also include  these surrounding enablers, but here, let’s limit ourselves to the technical aspects of  the VAS hardware and software itself.  Let’s also try and keep this chapter independent of the communication means  we are going to adopt. As such, calls, messages, data sessions, multimedia sessions,  and  so  forth,  can  be  referred  to  as  “communication  sessions”  including  several  “transactions.”  109   110  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  In fact, an NGN service provider could add the VAS platform inside the user  device  on top of a NGN User Agent , on servers in the core network  the most eas- ily manageable and commonly used model  or even let “third parties” deliver the  VAS  the model of application service providers . Similar requirements would arise  in the three cases, for the VAS platform.  For a long time the domain of Requests for Information  RfI , Requests for  Quotation  RfQ  and Requests for Proposal  RfP  by ﬁxed and mobile communi- cation service providers, here’s an attempt to summarize the common requirements  for these VAS platforms, independently of the application s  that would be hosted  on these systems.  6.1 Toward a Layered Platform Architecture Traditional VAS platforms  prepaid systems, voicemail, etc.  used to each have their  own  hardware,  operating  system,  database,  data  structures,  service  logic,  “south- bound” network interfaces and “northbound” interfaces for provisioning, billing and  supervision. A single subscriber would have been deﬁned in each of these platforms. A beneﬁt of these vertical “VAS silos” has been that they could be selected from  diﬀerent vendors, without too much integration eﬀort by the communication ser- vice provider.  However, new eﬃciencies could be found if the VAS platforms were organized   as follows  from top to bottom :  An IT sublayer, essentially a near-real-time  oﬀ-line  environment providing  the so-called “northbound interfaces”  provisioning, billing, supervision   to external IT systems, and oﬀering a service creation environment  An Applications sublayer, selecting and executing service logic based on  subscriber and service data in real time  online  — not only for charging  purposes but also to deliver meaningful communication services  A Service Capabilities sublayer, stateful* “connectors” isolating network and  protocol diﬀerences from the applications; some connectors are providing  the server side to the outside world, whereas others should act as the client  to third party databases; but in principle, the Service Capabilities them- selves should not require access to subscriber data†  only applications do   An Infrastructure sublayer, consisting of best-of-breed servers, operating sys- tems, database, protocol stacks, switches, routers, gateways for signaling  and media  * Stateful means that such connector  or Service Capability  should maintain a communica- tion session state  Context information , contrary to a protocol stack which only maintains a  transaction state.  † The problem would then arise how one Service Capability would access subscriber data held   on third party databases, through another Service Capability.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  111  Ideally, a new application could automatically use all existing service capabili- ties,  and  conversely,  all  applications  could  easily  be  improved  to  make  use  of  a  new service capability. Meaning that the common “language”  e.g., API, protocol,  procedures, message bus  through which the applications communicate with the  connectors should be universal from start: standard but extensible, extensible but  fast to decode and encode, and giving both parties a good grip on the state of the  other one. It is not an evident choice.  The purpose of this section is not to compare multiple competing technologies  for this language  e.g., JAIN SLEE, Parlay, Parlay X, OMA . Some of these stan- dards are discussed in Section 3.7.  SIP itself is of course a candidate. Today’s Media Servers  for packetized voice  and video , for example, can already be invited in the session by back-end applica- tions, using the SIP INVITE method. The Media Server then uses HTTP GET in  order to obtain VoiceXML scripts from the back end and play them  or other media  information in IETF MSML MOML format, PacketCable NCS, etc. . SIP itself is  thus not enough, and needs to be complemented or extended.  Even for quite basic call or message control, can the legacy and the new network  protocols* reliably be mapped to internal SIP, by the front-end service capabilities?  Will SIP allow preventing the network-speciﬁc aspects from impacting the back- end applications?  There has been a long debate on whether the “front-end” service capabilities  should reside on the same physical servers as the “back-end” applications, or whether  the servers should be dedicated  Service Capability Servers and Application Serv- ers . In principle, it sounds like a waste of computing and communication resources   server I O,† network bandwidth  to create a front-end-to-back-end dialogue that  would become  due to the protocol encapsulation required  almost as consuming  as the network-to-front-end communication. Moreover, inside a front-end Service  Capability, the mapping of protocol states, messages, parameters and values from  network side to application side should remain a vendor-speciﬁc competence. Stan- dardization attempts have failed. Let’s further assume that the VAS AS run both  the applications and the service capabilities.  As a quite unrelated topic, service creation is often only possible in the Application   layer, that is, through graphical environments where service logic can be modiﬁed.  Few service creation environments exist which allow editing database object  structures,  and  automatically  adapting  the  IT  aspects  such  as  screens,  security  permissions, provisioning commands or call tickets. Therefore, developing the IT  aspects for a new communications application today often amounts to 90% of the  eﬀort to develop the service.  * ITU-T INAP, ISUP, H.323, 3GPP CAMEL, MAP, IETF RADIUS, DIAMETER, etc. † Input Output.   112  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Diﬀerent service creation environments must be used to create new connectors  in the Service Capabilities layer, for example tools based on the Object Manage- ment Group’s  OMG  Uniﬁed Modeling Language  UML .  In the Infrastructure layer, the biggest eﬀort is probably to continuously requal- ify and adapt the software  service capabilities and applications  to an ever evolving  environment  of  servers,  operating  systems,  databases  and  gateways.  The  Advanced  Telecommunications Computing Architecture  AdvancedTCA  using Carrier Grade  Linux is today the most important standardization eﬀort in the server hardware area. Layering is of course a popular concept and has been used to justify “convergent  billing”  i.e., in fact generalized online charging  or the NGN architecture itself   see Section 3.1 .  Layering cannot become a goal in itself. Establishing the communication between  the layers is a long term investment; in the short term, the cost and complexity of add- ing another VAS silo will generally be lower and the performance  the handling capac- ity of communication events  will be higher. A lot of processing power can indeed be  spent on inter-layer communication rather than on actual network interaction.  The layered architecture of these platforms should ideally be reﬂected in matching  organizations, on telecom equipment manufacturer software vendor side as well as on  telecom service provider side. Otherwise, even the most perfectly layered technical plat- form will not lead to cost savings nor noticeable service quality improvements.  6.2 Load Balancing VAS platforms sometimes initiate transactions to core networks, but for most of the  time respond to requests from these networks.  In SS7 networks, SCCP Relay Nodes are able to spread or balance the load of  messages across a set of Signaling End Points  e.g., SS7-to-SIGTRAN signaling  gateways . The MTP layer underneath then ensures that multiple routes are avail- able to reach that Signaling End Point.  SIGTRAN network elements  e.g., the signaling gateway mentioned above  use an   Address Mapping Function to share the load across a set of SIGTRAN hosts.  Content Service Switches have been developed to balance a load of  Layer 7   HTTP requests across a Web server farm  Layer 4 . These CSS are today also select- ing  the  target  Web  server  farm  using  advanced  criteria  such  as  proximity,  user  prioritization, client device or requested content type. Smart functions have been  added, for example, to oﬀ-load SSL processing  Layer 5  from the Web servers,  hence accelerate content delivery.  Similar network solutions now exist for SIP. The  call  routing  logic  of  telephony  exchanges   ﬁxed  and  mobile   is  almost  always designed in three stages: analysis objects to  pre analyze the called party  number, routing objects a.o. to spread the load across multiple destinations, and  trunk groups  groups of circuits  to reach that next destination.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  113  In general, eﬀective load balancing is only possible using timely information  about the target server’s state, and or the communication application itself on that  server  if the server itself is reachable .  For example, by default, SIP  user agents or proxy servers  and HTTP clients  use Domain Name Service  DNS  resolution to direct the SIP messages to the des- tination servers  e.g., SIP registrars, proxies or Application Servers . The DNS could  return various answers in order to spread the load of SIP requests  this is known as  the DNS round robin mode . However, the DNS servers are not informed of sud- den unavailability of a destination SIP or HTTP server. Hence they cannot react  to such event, and the client needs to discover such unavailability itself, through  time-out  e.g., 30 seconds . It then needs to use a back-up server, indicated in the  DNS response.  So when designing a VAS platform, we should thus ﬁrst think about a watchdog  process  see Section 6.10  that will monitor the applications not only to restart them  in case of failure, but also to inform the third party load balancers.  Second, if the VAS platform is going to be used for the entire duration of the  communication,  the  load  balancer  should  also  maintain   count   the  number  of  communications in progress to each VAS platform and application.  Third, within a VAS platform itself, which can consist of multiple geographi- cally remote physical servers, each layer  of Section 6.1  should be designed to share  the load across the layer above it. This means that each layer should oﬀer a degree  of redundancy: the ability for separate modules to execute the same function. We’ll  address that in Section 6.3.  In the long term, one can wonder whether both network-based load sharing  and platform-internal load sharing are both required. Let’s say here that the former  should rely on open standards, whereas the latter can be optimally designed within  the VAS platforms, hence be more accurate. Designing too advanced internal load  balancing schemes may end up consuming an exaggerated amount of computing  and memory resources, compared to the service execution itself.  6.3 Redundancy As introduced above, redundancy implies that multiple modules should be able to  deliver the same service.  In  the  IT  layer,  multiple  servers  can  be  used  to  hold  the  platform’s  clustered  master database; each server is connected to the shared disk array. Solutions exist to  back-up the database to a remote site  server and disk array  periodically, in near real- time, should a catastrophic outage occur in the main disk array.  On the real-time Application Servers, multiple instances  independent UNIX  processes   can  be  used  to  avoid  that  the  failure  of  one  process  would  bring  the  whole AS down. Each so-called back-end process should reserve its own portion of  memory to store the Context information  e.g., the parameters of the calls, mes- sages, sessions in progress, subscriber and service data, counters, timers .   114  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  In the Service Capabilities layer, multiple instances can also be used to implement  a single “front-end” service capability  such as a messaging interface , but usually they  end up listening to a particular communication port  TCP, UDP port number  or  pool of port numbers of the server’s local IP stack. Hence, load balancing across the  service capability instances of a single server is normally network-based. Of course,  one such service capability instance should be able to balance the load of requests to  multiple application instances, based on their current load and availability.  At Infrastructure level, mirrored disks should protect the data from corrup- tion. Multiple physical  Ethernet  interfaces should connect the server to a single  external LAN switch. And a single server should be connected to multiple LAN  switches. That single server should be able to use multiple IP routers  behind these  LAN switches  to reach any IP destination. Routing protocols should be appropri- ately conﬁgured to inform the local servers of the availability of particular routes   i.e.,  next hops  to reach any particular destination — and, conversely, to inform  the external world of the IP reachability of the local servers.  After having performed load balancing, it is important for external load balancers  to direct all subsequent requests  messages, packets  of a same communication session,  to the same physical server  service capability instance . In the network, a frequently  used technique is to assign a general network address  e.g., SCCP Global Title, HTTP  SIP URI, host name  to an application, but then to let each server or service capability  instance indicate its own network address in the ﬁrst response to the external client.  Is this also the case for a service capability instance toward the set of application  instances? In principle, yes, all subsequent requests should go to the same applica- tion instance: only a given application instance has access to the necessary context  data to handle the current communication session.  This  means  that,  if  the  application  instance  fails  in  the  busy  hour,  all  ses- sions handled by that instance will be lost. In practice that can correspond to, for example, 100K€ of prepaid credit, allocated to ongoing communication sessions,  and which cannot be debited from the accounts.  Whereas this sounds unacceptable for a banking transactions server, most com-  munications service providers accept this risk  of loss of context data .  But in more advanced designs, the application instances can share common  functions   e.g.,  running  timers,  incrementing  counters   to  a  dedicated  process,  which again can exist in multiple instances.  Next, we’ll discuss database replication in Section 6.4, and memory synchronization   in 6.5, as techniques to share the information among multiple application instances.  6.4 Database Replication All layers, except the Infrastructure layer itself, require data  e.g., subscribers, ser- vice conﬁguration data, CDRs, alarms, statistics  to be stored persistently for days,  if not weeks or years. It is unacceptable to keep these data in memory only, and  assume that the servers will never fail or need to be upgraded.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  115  In this context, the pace at which these data change is referred to as the database   volatility.  As the added value of a service increases, so does database volatility. Data can be frequently altered at provisioning time, through user self-care, but  increasingly due to network events. Communication service providers expect good  visibility on the communications sessions, the attempts to set up such sessions, the  current health state of the platform and all activities executed  see Section 6.26 .  The IT layers of VAS platforms are sometimes evolving into real “data ware-  houses” for marketing studies on user behavior.  Persistent data should be propagated from the IT layer’s master database into  the real-time databases on the AS. The application and service capability instances  should read from their local real-time database* only.  When one AS needs to alter the persistent data, it could request the update to  one peer AS, to all peer AS, or to the IT layer. From the IT layer, replication to the  other AS can be more selective and conﬁgurable  to get only the correct pieces of  information in the correct AS .  In peer-to-peer networks, replications happens to a subset of peer AS: a set of  “super nodes” maintaining the persistent data. Try installing the Skype client on a  diﬀerent computer and logging in with your credentials: it takes a while for Skype to  replicate your list of contacts from one of these super nodes into your new computer. Whatever strategy is adopted, pending database replication requests  from AS  to IT or vice versa  should be cached in memory or written to the local database,  should the connectivity disappear or should the remote AS be out of service. As  long as there’s available space allocated in the replication buﬀers, automatic data- base resynchronization should be possible when the connectivity is restored. In case of longer outages, manual database resynchronization is possible. Database replication schemes should never be used for communication context  data. The consequence of writing these data to disk would dramatically handicap  the execution of service logic.  6.5 Memory Synchronization Horizontal memory synchronization is the only viable method to propagate con- text information across the AS farm, hence to reduce the risks associated with the  loss of context data.  Usually it will be performed to the peer AS  of an active standby pair ; but why not   to several AS, if the context data can be held in a suﬃciently compact format.  Also here, buﬀering and resynchronization after outages is a must. Compact, binary data structures are highly beneﬁcial to database replication  and memory synchronization, but other factors come into play when selecting a  database schema  see Section 6.20 .  * As mentioned, applications may also read from third party databases, through certain service   capabilities.   116  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  6.6 High Availability High Availability  HA  is the result of technical but also operational factors.  Most VAS and NGN platform vendors claim 99,999% availability, in general. But communication service providers have come to rely on more precise Service   Level Agreements  SLAs  with their suppliers.  In these contracts, it has been very diﬃcult to come to a clear deﬁnition of  service availability, as the communication service consists of the application and all  surrounding enablers  IT, Service Capabilities and Infrastructure .  Also, the distinction between congestion, partial unavailability, and outage, or  the classiﬁcation of faults into severity levels  i.e., critical, major, minor , has been  a point of lengthy discussions.  A high degree of redundancy alone does not ensure HA. For example, if all  ongoing communications are lost when an application instance fails, the platform  can still be considered to be redundant  if there are other application instances ,  but it is obviously less HA than if there would be memory synchronization for the  context information. And even then, a memory leak  an application reserving more  memory than it deallocates for each context  could occur in a perfectly redundant  system, probably aﬀecting all application instances at once.  6.7 Scalability Another popular confusion is between redundancy and scalability. Very redundant systems can turn out to be totally nonscalable. When adding the next  often more powerful  AS, database replication, memory  synchronization or other processes  CDR collection  can turn out to burn an ever  increasing amount of computing and communication resources, until all previous  AS have to be replaced by more powerful models.  Functional scalability is also to be considered: it cannot be the case that adding  online charging, for example, totally ruins the performance of a number translation  service.  It is useful to have, from start, a dimensioning  simulation  tool which predicts  resource utilization  CPU, memory, database, I O  for both functional and capac- ity upgrades, along the years.  6.8 Resource Allocation Resource utilization is of course strongly depending on the resource allocation policy.  A multitasking OS can make sure it grants suﬃcient CPU power and I O access   to diﬀerent processes, also based on their conﬁgurable relative priority.  A database can also be tuned to provide optimal response times to the most   critical users  applications .   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  117  But memory allocation is typically not governed by the infrastructure layer. It  should  be  possible  for  protocol  stacks  and  service  capabilities  to  receive  invalid, nonsupported or forbidden requests from the network, without memory  being needlessly reserved to hold a transaction or communication state.  If the network request is valid and permitted, Service Capabilities, by deﬁni- tion, rely on resource allocation to store the context information pertaining to the  communication session.  Applications must be able to extend this reservation, for example, to append   other transactions to the communication session.  But before the Application intervenes, Service selection uses the context infor-  mation, as mentioned in Section 6.9 below.  6.9 Service Selection When a communication service request  e.g., SIP INVITE  comes in from the net- work, it is important to design a good strategy to map the parameters of the request  to the correct application instance.  But often, the actual application service logic to be applied cannot be deter- mined before the subscriber and service database has been consulted  e.g., to dis- cover the originating user’s product type .  This process of service selection too often ends up being performed at the start of  the execution of a “default” application. When a new application is added, the network  or service capabilities still select the default application, and application chaining is then  required  to pass service control from one application to the next one . Introducing a  new service ends up impacting all existing default applications on the AS.  The network and service capabilities should thus invoke the service selection   process ﬁrst, by default.  Application instances should be able to signal their state and load to the service  selection process, for it to take action. It is therefore not a good idea to build the service  selection process into each service capability: they would all need to be informed.  The  service  selection  problem  is  diﬀerent  from  service  chaining:  the  service   selection process should normally select only one application to be executed.  6.10 Watchdog It  would  be  naive  to  assume  that  service  capability  instances,  service  selection  instances, application instances, and common processes will never become con- gested or fail.  A highly available platform should therefore include a watchdog process, continu- ously polling the other processes with “are you OK?” and “are you congested?” mes- sages, and taking appropriate action upon time-out or negative responses.   118  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  The watchdog process should restart failed processes and instruct the service selec-  tion instances to divert new requests to non-overloaded application instances.  6.11 Overload Protection Overload protection is the ability of the VAS platform to either reject incoming  requests from  the Session layer of  the network, or to instruct to throttle  lower   the number of requests.  Whatever is used  rejection or throttling , the VAS platform should maintain  counters of network events per second, per application, but perhaps also per origin,  destination,  and  so  forth,  if  communication  requests  should  be  rejected  at  that  more granular level.  The overload thresholds  limits as of which overload is detected  may either be  preprovisioned  static mode  or the system may, in real time, discover a top-10 of  applications, origins and destinations causing the overload  dynamic mode .  The  counters  and  thresholds  may  be  applicable  within  each  VAS  server   plat- form-speciﬁc ,  or  maintained  and  enforced  across  the  full  set  of  VAS  servers   application-wide .  Platform-speciﬁc overload control means that if one server is overloaded, the  network may decide to route new requests to the remaining other servers, which  are usually also busy at that moment, therefore causing a chain reaction. Therefore  the platform-speciﬁc approach to overload control is forbidden in cases where the  core network elements cannot be instructed to lower the number of requests  rather  than redistributing them to diﬀerent VAS servers .  The  application-wide  overload  protection  approach  requires  a  smart  way  to  communicate counters and overload events between the VAS servers, as otherwise  the VAS severs might end up consuming more resources talking about the overload than actually resolving it.  Whichever of these two methods is used, if the VAS platform simply rejects the  network’s request because of overload, the network should of course not simply retry  that request to the same server. Redistributing it to a diﬀerent one is as pernicious.  The originating  calling or message sending  user needs to be informed promptly  and properly, otherwise he she will simply retry, not knowing the nature of the  problem.  If the network can be instructed  by the VAS platforms  to throttle  lower  the  number of requests, this method should be preferred, but a number of extra issues  is to be addressed.  What  level  of  granularity  is  supported  in  the  network   e.g.,  by  application,  origin,  destination ?  The  application  to  be  invoked,  for  example,  is  sometimes  unknown by the network — only the fact that an application needs to be invoked  for a given subscribe, number range or domain.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  119  Second, it should be avoided that a network element receives conﬂicting instruc- tions from multiple VAS servers, therefore a pair of servers  active  cid:11  stand-by  must  be deﬁned  conﬁgured  to be responsible for each application, origin and destina- tion. The responsible pair collects the counters from the other servers and takes the  decision to ask all the network elements for throttling.  Third, the conditions should be deﬁned in which the throttling will be stopped   or at least, reduced . If this happens too fast, the rate at which throttling instruc- tions are given by the VAS layer will be too high.  Any overload protection strategy is strongly dependent on the network and user   device to accept instructions to retry later, indicating the reason  temporary overload .  Overload can also occur in diﬀerent processes of the VAS platform — not only  in service execution. Database access is an example. Batch operations on the data- base  e.g., to provision new subscribers, clean up old CDRs  can deprive the appli- cation execution processes.  6.12 Software Distribution The software on a complex VAS platform will evolve over time through multiple  versions, under inﬂuence of new requirements, but also in order to correct errors  discovered by operators worldwide.  The layered architecture described in Section 6.1 is not a guarantee that changes  within one layer will not impact components in the other layers. For example, new  application features often go hand in hand with new database objects  in the Infra- structure layer , and screens, CDRs or subscriber provisioning commands  in the  IT layer . Service Capabilities are usually more isolated, having less impact on the  other layers but still, they also produce CDRs, alarms, statistics, and so on, which  need to be processed in the IT layer.  A convenient way to deal with this is for the VAS platform provider to supply  software “packages,” containing the multiple components required to introduce a  given functionality.  Packages should also contain the install process used to install them; sometimes this  is an interactive process where the Operator needs to ﬁll in license keys, conﬁguration  preferences, and so on. Also the uninstall process should be part of any package.  The package install process may need to check the presence of other packages  before attempting to remove a component, if it may be shared by components of  diﬀerent packages.  Even updates to documentation or training materials can be part of a package. At any time it should be possible to check the full list of installed packages on   the servers, preferably from a central point.  These are all very common concepts in IT industry, but VAS providers have not   always oﬀered the appropriate level of rigor, transparency and consistency.   120  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  6.13 Software Versioning At each layer of the architecture of Section 6.1, the version will have a diﬀerent sig- niﬁcance; examples are a diﬀerent screen layout in the IT layer, a more reﬁned service  logic  in  the  Applications  layer,  support  for  new  network  interfaces  in  the  Service  Capabilities layer, or a new database object model in the Infrastructure layer.  Of  course  within  a  single  layer,  multiple  software  components  will  need  to  coexist, each dedicated to a single task and therefore having its own lifecycle of  improvements and corrections.  Many problems can be avoided with an upfront, clear and unambiguous deﬁni-  tion of a software versioning scheme.  Version numbers should be given to software components, not to packages. The  package should therefore clearly indicate the version number of each component. Four digits are usually suﬃcient to qualify the version of a software component,   in the format X.Y.Z.P where:  X  is  best  used  to  indicate  a  Major  Upgrade  of  the  component,  aﬀecting  the  way  existing  functionality  is  executed,  together  with  introducing  new  functionality.  Y should denote a Minor Upgrade, introducing signiﬁcant new functional-  ity but not aﬀecting the way existing functionality is performed.  Z should denote an Update, introducing limited new functionality that may  even be speciﬁc to a group of customers  as opposed to Minor Upgrades  which should be kept customer-independent! .  P should denote a Patch level, not introducing any new functionality and only  correcting bugs of diﬀerent severity  of course, Updates, Minor and Major  Upgrades should include ﬁxes for all known bugs at their time of issue .  This deﬁnition is only a general canvas, from experience, but may in practice fur- ther be reﬁned by suppliers and operators.  The purpose of this deﬁnition is not only clarity during operational discussions,  but  also  in  commercial,  contractual  and  legal  domains.  For  example,  it  is  very  important in a support contract to specify which software versions will be sup- plied and or installed for free by the supplier; which ones will be supplied installed  subject to a ﬁxed agreed price, and which ones will be subject to new, independent  commercial oﬀers.  6.14 Software Release Cycle Each software version goes through diﬀerent phases in the software production  process  —  from  concept,  over  scoping  and  planning,  requirements,  high-level  design, detailed design, unit testing, internal functional testing including nonre- gression,  compatibility  and  performance,  to  early  ﬁeld  trial,  general  availability,    Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  121  and so on. The know-how and experience of the software vendor are key to evaluate  which steps to perform for which type of component and version.  It is possible that not all intermediate versions  especially Patch levels  should be   installed in order to update or upgrade a platform to the latest available version.  Also there needs to be a well-documented procedure to announce the end of  life  EOL  of a version or the component itself, and the consequences in terms of  vendor support: usually only Patches are available for severe bugs and for a limited  time after the EOL announcement.  The release cycle greatly inﬂuences the total cost of ownership  TCO . Low-quality  software  will  result  in  many  patches   for  severe  bugs ,  updates,  upgrades,  forcing  the  operator  to  engage  signiﬁcant  human,  capital  and  opera- tional expenditure even to keep a comparable level of functionality throughout the  years.  High-quality software will consist of major upgrades  e.g., one every two years  that  contain enough functionality, in advance of a low number of minor upgrades  e.g., two  a year . Operator-speciﬁc updates will be delivered installed for free and without much  intervention from the operator. There will be almost no need to install patches; the  severity of bugs will be low and the patches could wait for the next update.  6.15 Backward Compatibility Each new version of a component brings along the risk to impact surrounding  components.  If these components are all within a same package, usually the versions in that   package will have been tested by the vendor to interoperate correctly.  Things  get  fuzzier  when  packages  introduce  new  components   or  versions   which need to interoperate with diﬀerent existing versions of other components   i.e., outside of the new package .  Therefore it is a good practice by the vendor to maintain and publish a software  compatibility grid or workbook. For all versions of any component, the compatibil- ity grid should indicate with which other components  and their version  backward  compatibility is  Ensured and veriﬁed Assumed but nontested Not assumed but nontested Tested, resulting in noncompatibility  6.16 Version Activation It is an operational nightmare having to install new software packages and com- ponents at night in the so-called “operational window,” right before they go into  production in the morning.   122  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Ideally,  packages  should  be  installed  well  in  advance,  without  removing  the   current components and versions being used in production.  The VAS platform would then include a version management and activation  process allowing traﬃc  and screens, provisioning commands, etc  to be switched  from one version of a component to a next one. In fact, allowing the components  of an entire package to exist in multiple versions, installed simultaneously on the  same platform.  To avoid excessive backwards compatibility requirements, all components of a  single package should be brought into production at once, but this is sometimes not  easy. Imagine the simultaneous traﬃc, subscriber data, and provisioning screens  migration during a major upgrade. Should a new version of the subscriber manage- ment screens  or provisioning commands  be made compatible with the previous  version of the database structures?  The support of multiple versions running in parallel on a VAS platform remains,  in practice, a noble objective to achieve. One with major beneﬁts in terms of opera- tional expenses, but only to be realized for software patches and updates  not for  minor and major upgrades .  6.17 Licensing Software  licensing  is  an  extensive  area  covering  technical  aspects   e.g.,  what  is  allowed to be used, how frequently, how to measure  but also commercial, contrac- tual and legal aspects.  Is a license granted for a package, for a software product  consisting of multiple   packages , or for a solution  a combination of products ?  What  happens,  for  example,  when  an  operator  using  the  software  license  is  acquired by a parent company also using the same product, but in a diﬀerent ver- sion? Are the two licenses somehow merged?  In this little section let’s focus on the technical aspects, assuming that the license   is granted for a software product with a feature road map.  The basic question is what metric will be used to identify the usage of the soft-  ware product:  Site-wide license: this unlimited usage will usually be aﬀordable by very   large corporate organizations.  Duration for which the license is required: a free test or evaluation license   may be granted for a limited period.  Number of CPUs of the servers on which the product is installed: unfair if  only some components are installed on some servers  front end Service  Capability servers  and other components on diﬀerent ones  back end  Application  Servers .  Also  unfair  if  the  software  is  deployed  on  N cid:11 M servers for redundancy. And this scheme doesn’t oﬀer an incentive to the    Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  123  software vendor to start supporting the latest  more powerful  CPUs, as  the overall license revenue will simply be reduced.  Number of telecom events being handled by the platform: successful only   or also unsuccessful communication attempts?  Number of potential  i.e., usually preprovisioned  users of the VAS: active  only, or also users which have obviously stopped using the service but are  still provisioned on the system?  Application-speciﬁc metrics such as number of scratch vouchers, credit top-  up operations, voice messages, presence notiﬁcations.  Any traﬃc-related metric will have to be very accurately deﬁned as a peak value,  an average or a median value, over a given measurement period  e.g., 1 hour , with a  number of measurements  e.g., 3600  and granularity  e.g., 1 second .  License measurement could be a continuous process, whereby the last N mea-  surement periods are averaged out  or the peak or median is calculated .  Alternatively, the time-of-week and day-of-year should be speciﬁed on which  such measurements  a period of 1 hour in the example  will be conducted; maybe  it’s worth not taking into account exceptional events such as New Year’s eve for  commercial license calculation.  Above a given usage threshold, the VAS system may even automatically stop  accepting new requests, but we think this shall be done only to protect the serv- ers from crashing  overload protection , not to enforce a commercial license. As  a golden design and operational rule, the infrastructural capacity should always  exceed the commercially licensed capacity.  6.18 Openness We already discussed the potential need for openness of the prepaid or postpaid  subscriber account in Section 5.12.  Diﬀerent forms of “openness” will also be required on the VAS platform:  Of course, the openness of the provisioning, billing and supervision inter-  faces to the northbound IT systems  OSS, BSS and TMN .  The ability for third-party applications to use the Service Capabilities of  the  platform,  via  open  Application  Programming  Interfaces,  and  vice  versa; this openness should not be over-valued by communication service  providers, as there are almost no such “third parties” able to develop com- ponents for multiple systems.  The ability for the VAS platform’s IT layer  local supervision screens  to  incorporate alarms, statistics and conﬁguration of closely linked third  party network elements such as Signaling GateWays, Media Servers or  Media GateWays.   124  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  6.19 Modularity Software is modular when the functionality is broken down to appropriately sized,  nonoverlapping entities. These entities are typically one notch lower in the hierar- chy than the components we discussed in Section 6.12.  Using a reasonable number of Dynamic Linked Libraries  .dll , each dedicated  to an understandable function, for example, decoding encoding a given protocol,  is a good example of modular design.  An  average  Service  Capability,  for  example,  would  need  to  speak  at  least  a  southbound protocol  toward the network  and a northbound protocol  toward the  application , plus libraries for TMN FCAPS functions and so forth.  Hence the rules outlined in Sections 6.1 and 6.12 unfortunately do not prevent  telecom software  VAS platform software in this case  to become nonmodular. A  same protocol library is included as diﬀerent code in two service capabilities; diﬀer- ent applications start using diﬀerent code for database access or CDR generation,  diﬀerent screen panels and underlying database tables include similar subscriber  information, and so on.  As this level of detail is usually visible only in the detailed design documents  and in the source code itself, it is diﬃcult for the communication service provider  to assess the modularity of the code.  6.20 Data Model The data model is a representation of the persistent information in the subscriber  and service database. It can also be used to describe in-memory information such  as call contexts or protocol state machines.  Usually a call model comes as a diagram of database tables, linked to each other   via one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.  It helps people understand the existing information, and to imagine how new   information can best be added.  too few rows.  A data model needs to be modular, avoiding tables with too many columns or   There should only be one data model for the entire VAS platform, not for each  Application. Transgressing this rule invariably results in silo applications, where the  object “Subscriber” exists within each application silo, in a slightly diﬀerent form. Having a single data model forces the VAS application developer to recognize   the fact that the subscriber may have subscribed to multiple applications at once.  A good data model puts the Subscriber at the center. But, often, large groups  of subscribers will share the same values for most of the attributes. Repeating this  information in thousands or millions of rows is an ineﬃcient approach. Therefore,  the common properties of a group of Subscribers should be deﬁned as a Product.  This Product may be application-speciﬁc or platform-wide.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  125  However, with today’s highly personalized VAS, there’s a risk of explosion of the  number of Products. It is indeed tempting, whenever a new feature X needs to be  introduced, to break down Product A into  i.e., divide Subscribers among  a Prod- uct A1 containing the new feature and a Product A2 not containing it. The next  feature comes along, and Products A11, A12, A21, and A22 appear.  Therefore it is interesting and necessary to create the object Option too, linked   to the Subscriber in a one-to-many relationship, and to the Product.  The communication service provider will acquire subscribers through diﬀerent  direct and indirect channels, with potentially diﬀerent requirements in terms of  available applications and features. It is a good idea to link the Subscribers and the  Product Types to a Channel object. Diﬀerent Channels could also represent internal  and test subscribers. CRM agents belonging to a given Channel should be entitled  to view and update only their “slice”  Subscribers, Products  of the system.  The platform-wide Subscriber-Product-Option-Channel paradigm has proven  to be very diﬃcult to add, once diﬀerent Subscriber objects had been deﬁned in  multiple applications.  It is therefore something to be enforced at the heart of the VAS platform, as part  of the fundamental infrastructure, or even throughout the entire communication  service provider organization.  6.21 Storage Strategy The persistent data model needs to be stored in nonvolatile media: typically, hard  disk drives.  These  can  be  located  inside  each  VAS  server,  or  centrally  deployed  as  disk  arrays,* accessed by the servers via a SAN  Storage Access Network  — usually  using optical ﬁber channels. Hard disk controllers  whether inside the server, or in  central disk arrays , will normally write the same information on two hard disks, a  principle called mirroring.  Whereas mirroring is a must, the degree of redundancy of the disk arrays and  of the  single or dual  controllers inside each disk array is to be appreciated by the  VAS supplier and the NGN communication service provider.  The inconvenient truth about SAN is that they require immense and unpredictable  bandwidth between a server on site A and a disk array on site B  in the order of a few  to hundreds of Mbit s , which is a problem in wide area and transnational set-ups. The  bandwidth needs to be purchased from transmission providers  e.g., STM-1, OC-3   rather than from Internet service providers — a much more competitive sector.  Therefore the new trend in IT industry is called Virtualization: database servers  on central sites are accessed by decentralized, remotely located application servers   VAS servers in this case , using SQL*Net, LDAP or other protocols; over MPLS IP   *  Not to be confused with a database server.   126  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  networks, usually with end-to-end Security and Quality-of-Service enforcement. The  throughput requirements are however not much lower than in SAN, even though  previous responses can be cached in the application servers, if the data are not too vol- atile. Also, only persistent database information can be shared this way  no transient  in-memory data . Finally, Virtualization is not a guarantee that the actual data will  be stored on multiple sites. For a disaster-proof architecture, it is up to the application  developer to make sure  or preferably at VAS Infrastructure level  that all processes  write to two diﬀerent databases  Data Source Names  located on diﬀerent sites.  There’s a third possible storage strategy, besides SAN  brutal force  and Virtu- alization  a partial solution . But it requires the VAS platform supplier to develop  his own selective Database Replication strategy  top-down — cf. Section 6.4  and  Memory  Synchronization   horizontal  —  cf.  Section  6.5 .  The  in-memory  data  will namely often end up being written and committed to the database too. This  approach will be less bandwidth-hungry, as storage is local  inside the servers or  disk arrays on a local SAN . Only data requiring to be replicated  insert, update and  delete queries , are actually transmitted to the central master replication servers or  peer servers. Read queries are performed locally.  We believe it is a good idea to align the storage strategy for both the Application  and IT layers of the VAS platforms. Today, with full throttle on Virtualization of  IT infrastructures, but little attention to VAS platforms, this is seldom the case.  6.22 Backup and Recovery Besides holding the same data, it is important for the Application Servers and IT  servers to beneﬁt from back-up and recovery procedures to and from the so-called  disaster recovery  DR  sites.  DR is a booming business, which is, by the way, still a candidate to be out-  sourced from many organizations.  DR  sites  have  become  the  atomic  bunkers  of  any  sustainable  business   e.g.,  communication, banking, insurance, airlines . And it is tempting to test the evacu- ation procedure to these bunkers once and for all, namely, upon construction of the  bunker. Nobody also worries about what will happen when people ultimately get  out of such bunker, and huge data streams ﬂow out of their DR sites.  Now speaking about the scope of the backup, everyone would certainly agree  that subscriber, account, and CDR databases should be backed up. IT administra- tors could already be more skeptical about conﬁguration ﬁles and application soft- ware, but what if it took 10 hours to reinstall the software packages and all patches,  in order to restore a failed system?  6.23 Remote Access Remote access to a park of VAS servers should happen through a single entry point   e.g., a terminal server  or at least a single sign-on procedure.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  127  Indeed, it is inconceivable to deﬁne UNIX logins, passwords and ﬁle permis-  sions on a per machine basis.  The  topic  of  remote  access  brings  up  a  related  topic,  namely  the  passwords  policy. It should not be allowed to deﬁne trivial general password acceptance and  refreshment policies. Trivial passwords should not be accepted; the user should be  informed about the estimated strength of his newly chosen password, and access  should not be permitted without the user regularly being forced to refresh his her  password.  Of course the remote access pipe needs to be secure. Various IP VPN products  allow remote support personnel to access the company LAN through the public  Internet, but their permissions should be limited to a given set of machines and  logins.  Limiting the access to only a set of machines is a poor option, as support teams  from diﬀerent software vendors should be able to log in to a shared VAS application  server, and see only their application’s directories and ﬁles  or only the database, for  example  — perhaps a noble but unachievable goal.  6.24 Hosting The all-IP NGN and VAS platform architecture calls for hardware, OS and soft- ware hosting.  Hosting is today known as the activity to rent and maintain computer hard- ware,  operating  systems,  databases,  remote  access  servers,  ﬁrewalls,  rack  space,  reliable power, cooling, and LAN and IP connectivity for either NGN service pro- viders or VAS software suppliers.  Hosting is providing a hotel for applications. And in a hotel, check-in and check-out are among the more important proce-  dures inﬂuencing customer satisfaction.  6.25 Reporting Reporting  is  too  often  confused  with  performance  management   which  we’ll  address in Section 6.26 .  Periodic, triggered and on-demand reports should inform the NGNSP about  the uptake of communication means and value-added services, both in terms of  subscription and usage.  This starts from the number of subscribers having subscribed, via a given com- mercial channel, to a given service, product type and individual options — the  structure we discussed in Section 5.1.  Next, the usage needs to be analyzed not only in terms of successful communi- cation events per service, product type, option and destination, but also in terms of  failed session establishment attempts.   128  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  And certainly, the NGNSP should get a good view of how infrequently certain   options are used, in order to simplify the commercial oﬀer.  Finally, an important aspect of reporting is that it should allow a NGNSP to  detect a decrease in usage by certain partners  peer NGN, ASP’s  or subscribers.  Today this is often considered to be a data warehouse function, generating a weekly  report,  but  in  an  increasingly  volatile  NGN  environment,  a  sudden  decrease  in  traﬃc from a given source can already indicate that an important peer, ASP or user  agent has selected another NGNSP as the next hop. Conversely, a too interesting  oﬀer can suddenly attract far too much traﬃc and result in Service Level Agree- ments not being met anymore.  It is not a subscriber decision anymore. For all these reasons, reports cannot be generated by post-processing CDRs col-  lected from the core network and VAS platforms.  The VAS platform itself needs to generate a conﬁgurable set of reports, a set of  counters and even alarms on these counters  thresholds , informing the NGNSP’s  commercial chain about a corrective action to be taken  advertising a new price,  for example .  This commercial battle can be won only with suﬃcient automation.  6.26 TMN FCAPS The Telecommunications Management Network  TMN  is originally a protocol  model  deﬁned  by  the  International  Standards  Organization   ISO ,  then  ITU-T  with the M.3000 series of recommendations. TMN was structured in Business,  Service, Network and Element management. It included a protocol called Common  Management Information Protocol  CMIP, ITU-T X.700 series , which today is  largely superseded by the IETF Simple Network Management Protocol  SNMP . SNMP deﬁnes an Agent, located on the VAS platform in this case, communi- cating with an external Network Management System  NMS , which is shared by  many network systems  e.g., access network, core network, VAS platforms . The  Agent can eventually be split up as a Master Agent and Subagents, each responsible  for a particular subsystem.  The Management Information Base  MIB  deﬁnes the objects being managed  and their properties. For a VAS platform, the quality and documentation of a MIB  is an indicator for the quality of supervision to be expected  does it cover the soft- ware components? .  Today,  in  practice  TMN  compatibility  means  that  a  VAS  platform  and  the   applications should be supervised or managed by 5 functions:  Fault management: alarms of various severity levels are sent by the Agent to  the NMS, as SNMP Traps. An important role of the NMS is to correlate  alarms produced by diﬀerent network systems, and consecutive alarms  produced repeatedly, to be due to a single event.   Technical Requirements for a Modern VAS Platform   cid:78  129  Conﬁguration management: the NMS should be able to modify conﬁgu- ration  details   e.g.,  addresses,  timers,  table  sizes   in  the  VAS  platform  — this is very seldom the case.  Accounting  management:  the  VAS  platform  should  produce  a  CDR  for   each service event, and transport it to the BSS.  Performance  management:  the  VAS  platform  should  produce  statistics  counters regarding each object in the MIB, and periodically send them  to the NMS.  Security management: the VAS platform should protect itself from intru- sion by nonauthorized persons, a.o. with individual logins also to appli- cation screens, a periodic passwords reset policy, etc.  6.27 Migration Tools Subscriber  and  service  database  structures  in  a  VAS  platform  will  be  enriched  over time, as new functions are plugged in to the VAS software. A migration tool  will extract the subscriber and service data used by the previous application soft- ware release, manipulated and reinsert it in the database, to be used by the next  release.  This process can happen in batches of say 10,000 subscribers, or as a continuous  process  one by one . But it is important to include the roll-back functionality, the  ability to restore the previous situation before the batch, or even the initial situation. A major new application software release will also bring new screens, MML pro- visioning commands, CDRs, alarms, statistics, reports, and so on. In most cases, it  will be unfeasible to upgrade the neighboring IT systems to switch to the new version  overnight, or support two versions simultaneously  e.g., old provisioning commands  for nonmigrated subscribers, and new commands for the migrated and new ones .  Here, the best strategy is probably to install the new software release support- ing both the old and the new version of the MML, switch these external interfaces  to use the new MML one by one, migrate all subscribers  by batch or continuous  process , and then only stop supporting the old MML. The same is true for screens  and the other components. It sounds like common sense but how many times is  only the application software per se considered to be a user of the subscriber and  service data?  Migration tools should thus include “railroad switch” processes between old and  new versions of a provisioning interface, screens server or alarms generating process. During  major  upgrades,  hardware,  OS  and  databases  will  also  need  to  be  replaced. Most of these changes can however be performed in production environ- ments, without requiring migration tools, thanks to the N  cid:11  cid:0 1 or 2N redundant  design of the VAS platform.  A VAS platform architecture needs to be scalable not only from the quantitative   perspective but increasingly from a functional perspective.   130  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  6.28 Documentation Here we arrive at the edge of the VAS platform features, and enter the domain of  what we called the surrounding enablers in the introduction of this chapter.  Documentation  should  be  built  into  provisioning,  operations  and  supervision   screens  as hyperlinks  and MML commands  as help pages  as much as possible.  The  days  are  over  when  CRM  agents,  operations  and  supervision  engineers  could be trained for weeks on the signiﬁcation of ﬁelds, on processes and available  features.  A new application or platform software release should thus also come with the   appropriate new documentation modules.  6.29 Support Platform  and  application  software  support  is  another,  yet  even  more  important  enabler of modern communication services.  It would require a dedicated book to describe the aspects of a competitive sup- port  process.  The  Service-Level  Agreement   SLA   between  service  provider  and  platform or software supplier would be one of the chapters.  Strictly from a VAS platform perspective, the supportability of a VAS platform  and software of course depends on almost all characteristics we discussed in this  chapter.  Supportability, which can be expressed, for example, as a reasonable number of  cases and rapid resolution times, is the reward for service providers and suppliers  who have respected these principles of VAS platform design.   Chapter 7 New Generation of Value-Added Services  In the past chapters, we have made an attempt to do the following:  Characterize communication means, in Chapter 1 Examine the communication service providers’ starting position, in Chapter 2 Summarize the networks proposed by the standards bodies, in Chapter 3 Interconnect these networks, in Chapter 4 Evaluate the charging requirements, in Chapter 5 Produce the wish list for the service platforms that will host the new appli-  cations, in Chapter 6  We should now have a good idea of the environment in which successful Value-  Added Services  VAS  could be created, at least from a technical perspective.  Our macro-view in Section 2.5 even suggested that there could be room for new   VAS proposals, to be accessed by enterprise telephones and mobile data devices:  Will basic TISPAN NGN service  establishing SIP sessions, with QoS enforce- ment  and  SBC  functions   at  $10  a  month  be  considered  superior  to  Plain  Old  Telephone Service  PSTN  at $6 a month?  Would you invest in your own $35-a-head, fully serviced enterprise IP PBX, or  would you rather rely on a $10-a-month voice and video centrex oﬀer from your  NGN service provider?  Rather than subscribing to a $35-a-month IPTV program, digital DVB-H or  even plain old analogue broadcasting at $20 a month, people might pay a $5 to $10  premium a month to view YouTube videos on large screens, in a high-deﬁnition  video version — with some IP QoS enforced.  131   132  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Figure 7.1 Macroeconomic perspective on the opportunities for NGN VAS.  Rather than visiting various gaming, gambling and girls sites,* and spending  an unpredictable $40-a-month on heteroclite and perhaps untrustworthy sites, the  less adventurous among us might spend $10 on a super search site oﬀering only free  previews, trials and contests.  Why spend $35 a month on mobile data connectivity when for $10 you could  subscribe to a media kiosk at your federation of WiFi hotspots, automatically down- loading your selection of electronic newspapers and magazines to your PDA, PSP,  or media player, whenever you’d pass by such hotspot.  Would you prefer to spend $10 a month on quite patchy, ﬂaky and meshed  WiMAX coverage, allowing you to run your own VoIP user agent, rather than $30  a month on ubiquitous GSM  cid:11  cid:0 GPRS coverage forcing you to wait 1 second for a  reply to ping?  At this point, most telecom service providers would argue that our macro-level and  technology-driven approach needs to be counterbalanced with a marketing exercise. This chapter would then deﬁne the marketing mix  Product, Pricing, Promotion,  Placement distribution — the four Ps  for individual VAS or bundles, in an attempt  to position them to a segmented population of communication service consumers.  *  The popular joke about 3G services.   New Generation of Value-Added Services   cid:78  133  OK, service marketing is quite diﬀerent from the marketing of Fast Moving Con- sumer Goods, and requires an extended marketing mix adding three P’s  People,  Process and Physical evidence . The right  sales  people would apply well-oiled pro- cesses and demonstrate physical evidence  though free trials, previews, etc . In viral  marketing, the sales people can be the VAS users themselves.  Some of these Ps would certainly inﬂuence technical solutions, and as such,   VAS engineering and marketing would march hand in hand.  This  entire  approach,  however,  remains  end  user  centric.  According  to  such  approach, very heteroclitic* VAS could be developed at any cost, well in advance of  demand, and independently of legacy infrastructure and services — as long as they  would be well targeted at certain market segments.  To my opinion, there are multiple potential stakeholders in the success of a   VAS, besides residential, business and corporate communication consumers:  The communication service providers themselves, who need to capitalize  on past investments, that is, in PSTN or GSM networks; as such, the  new VAS should span diﬀerent networks by nature  Application  service  providers,  who  are  going  to  compare  the  NGN  ver- sion  of  a  VAS  to  the  non-NGN   Internet-only   version  —  IM VoIP  providers,  for  example,  are  today  not  the  demanding  party  for  NGN  standardization  Regulators and governments, who are looking at widely adopted services  but lack of control — are lawful interception, emergency calling, carrier  selection and number portability going to be supported for these new  communication means?  Advertisers,  a  party  which  has  propelled  many  Internet  service  business   models, but seems to be absent from today’s telecom services  Device manufacturers, who are sometimes not convinced of the need to  use communication rather than storage and computing  remember our  discussions in Sections 1.2 and 1.3   Communities,  who  need  to  beneﬁt  from  these  VAS,  sometimes  even  against the interest of individual consumers — for example, the com- munity moderator should be able to refuse new members, scan content,  and block end users.  The telecom IT sector in general, which cannot support another wave of   failing hypes after the mobile data bubble in the early 2000s  We could even extend the list of stakeholders to the investors, workforce, and sup- pliers of these organizations.  Many of these parties deserve to be treated as customers, but they haven’t been   in the past, in many examples.  *  Diﬀerent and incoherent.   134  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  Voice-over-IP telephones are now supposed to have stickers with “do not use in  case of emergency.” Before the TISPAN standards, it is indeed impossible for VoIP  service  providers  to  physically  locate  them.  And  anyway  most  VoIP  phones,  IP  routers and WiFi access points do not have a battery, for cases of power outage.  Device  manufacturers  are  facing  a  fragmented  market  of  form  factors   e.g.,  desktop, laptop, pocket PC, navigator, mobile phone, portable game console, media  player . Moreover, they have to select and maintain mobile voice and data commu- nication technologies and provide on-board features such as cameras, Bluetooth,  WiFi,  ﬁrewall,  music,  games  and  video  players.  Maybe  we  should  requalify  the  manufacturers as device assemblers, because that’s what they have become by using  so many advanced shared components. They get little indications from network  vendors and service providers when it comes to predicting how end users will use  the device to communicate.  In  a  recent  survey  by  the  GSM  Association,  American  mobile  phone  users  ranked mobile e-mail as the number one mobile data service, but the GSM ser- vice providers, network vendors and 3GPP never speciﬁed any enhancement for  e-mail delivery. One could have imagined standards for compression, free header  previews, lawful interception possibilities, personal storage space for attachments  in the network rather than on the mobile device, and so on. Instead, 3GPP and  GSMA developed and promoted MMS, a competing technology with per-message  charging model.  Classic mobile telephony and text messaging has oﬀered very few opportunities   for sponsoring and advertising, contrary to instant messaging clients.  Communities  e.g., my son’s soccer club  cannot subscribe to any communica- tion service at all; if a match is canceled, the trainer uses his personal prepaid credit  to notify the parents by SMS.  This new, expanded environment is disruptive to classic telcos and cellcos; it  goes along the trend to decouple the device, connectivity and service we discussed  in Section 1.6.  It requires a transition of the same magnitude as the step from state-owned   PTTs  Post, Telecom and Telegraph  to a competitive landscape in the 1990s.  As of now, no single player can pretend to oﬀer the dominating device, connec- tivity or service anymore, certainly not for a long time. And due to the merging and  acquisition activity in the background, it becomes diﬃcult to identify that “single  player” anyway. The game is about specialization, complementarity, and collabora- tion, rather than overlaps and head-to-head competition.  So  in  summary  of  this  introduction,  VAS  proposals  should  be  evaluated  along an extended list of attributes: the basic forces we discussed in Chapter 1,  the 7-P service marketing mix and of course the interests of an extended list of  stakeholders.  With this in mind, let’s examine a few examples of these VAS.   New Generation of Value-Added Services   cid:78  135  7.1 Media Pilot Mobile service providers and device manufacturers have been struggling for a long  while to bring the Internet browsing or TV experience to a handheld device, and  they  still  do.  The  network  infrastructure  is  capable  of  delivering  these  services,  but the relatively tiny screens on cell phones and absence of keyboard remove the  pleasure from browsing. And a convincing digital TV experience starts with fast  channel ﬂicking.  The idea here is to start using the NGN device  e.g., IP phone, SIP softphone   as a controller for the media experience  browsing or digital TV . These devices are  very likely to include a keypad, so let’s try and use that one to control which link  is clicked on a Web page, whether the movie needs to play, pause, fast forward, the  movements of a character in an online game, and so forth.  With circuit-switched telephony it would have been inconceivable to set up a  call and pass DTMF digits  the tones corresponding to key strokes  in-band to the  TV station — let alone that the TV station would in those days have been able to  provide video or games on demand to individuals.  NGN technology has removed both barriers. The new economics of NGN net- works imply that sessions are allowed to last much longer than circuit-switched calls  used to be. An NGN user agent has four methods at its disposal to pass DTMF  information to the network  we listed them in Section 4.7.7 ; whether the keypad  strokes travel as SIP signaling  INFO, NOTIFY  or in RTP packets doesn’t matter   at ﬁrst sight .  Second, the NGN allows emitting personalized video and audio streams to the  end user, using standard encoding decoding mechanisms. The conversion of Web  pages, analog, digital TV channels and games to H.263 and H.324M encoded  video,  plus  the  injection  of,  for  example,  a  pointing  arrow  in  the  picture  is  an  important, resource-intensive task.  So it becomes possible for the media pilot, this new NGN VAS provider, to col- lect these upstream keystrokes, look up the originating user’s proﬁle, and pilot the  downstream media experience accordingly. A media pilot thus browses the Web,  ﬂicks the TV channels or inputs moves to an online game on behalf of the end  user. It transforms the results  highlighted Web links, the next Web page, a paused  movie, a personal settings menu, etc.  to the device chosen by the end user as NGN  media streams or even digital TV.  Pressing “1” on the keypad means clicking that link on the top left corner of the  Web page. Pressing “2” means moving the pointing arrow northbound. Pressing  a “5” in the middle of the keypad is used to pause or resume a movie on demand.  Pressing a “4” means the snowboarder moves to the left in the game. Pressing “6”  could make a home surveillance camera turn right. Pressing “8” while navigating  Google Earth on your TV will make the image tilt so you can see the horizon.   136  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  It is up to the NGN service provider to ensure the upstream and downstream   information is delivered with minimal delay.  How far will the pointing arrow move, and how sharp will that snowboarder  turn  to  the  left?  Well,  if  the  upstream  DTMF  information  remains  in  band  to  the NGNSP, or is encoded as in RFC 2833  including duration , or if the DTMF  signals are carried in-band of a circuit-switched call, the NGNSP is able to com- municate the duration to the Media Pilot.  Hence a Media Pilot transforms your plain vanilla SIP phone into a universal,  standard remote control for everyday life: it will allow you to key in the ﬂoor you  want to go to, in advance of you entering the elevator. It could allow construction  workers to move the crane on a building site. To lock your car’s doors, open your  garage door, pilot your domotics system, your media center, or the music played at  the club: the possibilities are thus inﬁnite and unexplored to date.  Network-based media pilots have the potential to make Windows Vista look   like grandma’s user interface.  Many applications will arise from the fact that today only one or two remote  controls are provided with any appliance, that these remotes have a short range, and  are incompatible.  Perhaps this will also call for a motion control protocol to be invented between   the media pilot and the end device or application.  7.2 Personal Contact Pages Personal welcome pages are the evolution of the personalized ring back tone, per- sonalized welcome video, company Web site, and personal Web space. It builds  further on the idea from the previous section to turn multimedia user experiences  into NGN media streams.  Users of the service receive a default “contact page” which will be played as  video, for all session establishment requests  SIP INVITE  arriving at their current  telephone number and preferred domain name  e.g., sip:32472700855@mycom- pany.com . The scope could be extended to other SIP methods such as SIP MES- SAGE,  or  other  incoming  communications  such  as  traditional  circuit-switched  calls or texts  SMS .  The  provider  of  this  new  VAS,  the  personalized  contact  page  service  provider   PCPSP , will thus become the default SIP server for the mycompany.com domain,  which would need to be communicated to the public DNS infrastructure. De facto, the  PCPSP thus becomes the inbound communication handler  the ICH of Section 4.5 . The idea of a PCPSP of course also responds to the requirement to deliver a   contextual portion for NGN communications  Section 1.5 .  It is probably not up to the NGNSP to take on this contextual portion; a whole   ecosystem of specialized PCPSP might appear in the residential service.  In response to the session establishment request, the originator would be pre- sented an audio stream, video stream or message response, showing information as    New Generation of Value-Added Services   cid:78  137  deﬁned by the destination  called  PCP user. Personalized ring tones, videos, and  messages could be returned to the originator, based on the PCP user’s preferences  a  diﬀerent ring tone for my parents than for my colleagues  or originating terminal’s  capabilities. It should be possible to present an existing Web site to the originator   e.g., ﬂash intro of the company  as the video response.  PCP’s  fundamental  objectives  are  to  protect  the  end  user  from  intrusiveness;  therefore a rules-based system would be able to black-list certain originators and take  into account the time of week or day of year, or even presence and location events.  It is unacceptable to expect the basic PCP user to go through 10 pages of self  care to deﬁne the settings, media and rules — even though also that should be  accessible for the aﬁcionados. The PCPSP should learn this from the past behavior   e.g., calls messages received, ring tones downloaded, billing relationship, etc  to  predict the best settings. In the enterprise environment, some PCP settings would  be company-wide, administered centrally, and so on.  A good PCP would be coupled to existing presence and availability information  at IM providers, in Lotus Exchange Calendars, or indicated in real time by PBX  attendants.  If the PCP user does not accept the call, video session or message, the PCP SP   should propose the originator to store voice, video or text messages.  In the future, PCP would present the originator with buttons to leave an e-mail,  contact  another  responsible  via  SIP  redirection,  or  immediately  leave  a  message  without disturbing the destination PCP user.  A company PCP would hold routing and hunting logic comparable to today’s   freephone numbers.  From a marketing perspective, the service could be sold to residential, SOHO  businesses and corporate customers. It could be given for free to residential users,  as there’s incoming interconnection revenue, when the NGNSP and PCPSP receive  calls and texts from traditional networks.  7.3 Multichannel Media A frequent complaint about VoIP is the disappointing audio quality  the Mean  Opinion Score, we discussed that back in Section 3.6.4 .  Hence the idea is to multiply the parallel audio channels transmitted over the   NGN, to obtain stereo, 5.1, or even “N.1” sound.  This calls for WiFi microphones that can be positioned in the four corners of  your living room and communicate via SIP RTP, through the NGNSP, to a Multi- Channel Media Service Provider  MCMSP . On the other side, N channels are  delivered to the recipient’s Bluetooth headset.  The audio stream being played to the recipient’s headphones depends on his  position  relative  to  the  microphones  in  the  room.  In  other  words,  in  a  5.1  sys- tem, as the listener  destination user  moves closer to the back left microphone, the    138  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  MCMSP presents a mix of audio streams containing more sound recorded at the  back left microphone of the originator.  Let’s try and imagine the video version of this service: four SIP WiFi Webcams  record an image on the originating side  front left right, back left right  and the  image the recipient sees on his portable NGN device  e.g., a portable WiFi-enabled  gaming console  depends on the position and orientation of that device relative to  his her own cameras.  The MCMSP calculates a resulting image based on this info, and the four video   feeds from the originating cameras.  Alternatively, the image could depend on motion sensors in the recipient device,   or Galileo,* instead of external position beacons.  Whatever positioning technology is used, you could explore every angle of a  3D object  a statue on the originating museum for example , by physically walking  “around it” on the destination side  your living room .  Now combine video and audio and the communication experience could be  tremendous, even with relatively compact handheld NGN devices  screens  on the  receiving end.  Multichannel media have the potential to introduce new forms of clubbing par- tying, casino, games and sports. Imagine virtually standing on the soccer ﬁeld dur- ing the match, watching the action from a couple of meters, including the audio!  7.4 Combinatory Services The separation of audio device  microphone and speaker in a Bluetooth headset  and  terminal device  camera phone, even already with two cameras  has opened new pos- sibilities to share pictures or video during the voice conversation.  Contrary to the multichannel media above, combinatory services do not require  the diﬀerent media streams to be mixed together to produce a new media stream.  As such, they don’t rely on massive computing power to process the streams.  It would probably also be ﬁne to launch the service without synchronizing the  audio and video streams — the recipient would see the originator’s lips moving out  of sync, but if this service is meant to be used to ﬁlm or picture landscapes and  interiors, who cares?  Should these multiple media streams then be added to a single session, or may  they be negotiated and carried in diﬀerent sessions? At ﬁrst sight, it seems ﬁne to  do the latter.  Is there a need to have these multiple sessions being established by a single,   500€ phone? Or could I use a 100€ SIP camera and my 100€ cell phone?  * The future European GPS system, which will provide accuracy down to a few centimeters,   with a subscription.   New Generation of Value-Added Services   cid:78  139  There are many questions around combinatory services, and it is much too early   to rush into  e.g., 3GPP IMS  standardization.  Contact List Overlay  7.5 We have addressed the need for network-based contact lists and tribe memberships  in Section 1.11.  It is time for communication service providers to provide the network-based  address book, or at least to periodically synchronize the NGN device’s address book  with the network-based copy.  It’s so easy to join a company or soccer club and have access to all employees  and members from day one. How much more would we communicate if things  were so easy?  How easy would be the decision to change your NGN device monthly, or even  have several for diﬀerent uses, if you didn’t have to worry about your address book  anymore and, by extension, your agenda, tasks, and messages?  The IETF SIMPLE group has proposed the PIDF  see Section 3.2.3.3 , laying  the groundwork for a standards-based form of Plaxo, today’s leading network-based  address book.  Huge developments are to be expected if the NGN User Agent starts to be con- sidered as a contacts repository too, rather than today only as a session establisher,  codec negotiator and media encoder decoder.  7.6 Voice on Web Is a NGN user agent — a downloadable piece of software as we know it today —  installed in your PC for a few months or years?  Since the advent of voice-on-Web,* one can doubt it. In such cases, the software of  the user agent is perhaps downloaded and executed as an ActiveX component setting  up the session  SIP INVITE . It might even be the site itself  the Web server  register- ing itself as User Agent in the NGN and setting up the sessions.  It was already obvious from the skins on music playing software, that end users  would expect the looks of their music, video and communication software to be  fully customizable.  But it would be suﬃcient to add “NGN buttons” to existing Web sites, “desk-  bars” to the user’s desktop PC environment, and so on.  Perhaps one day we will start a SIP session when clicking on a Google adword,   or a term in Wikipedia? Ask the experts …  * The abbeyphone.com site by Abbeynet.com is a “SIP VoIP Web portal.”    Chapter 8 Future Digital Life  It’s a sad evening here in Brussels, November 3, 2043. It’s 9: p.m., still quite hot as  grandma and I are ﬂoating on our water sofa, ﬂicking some membranes, these semi- opaque pictures and videos produced by our brain chips. We’re sipping an apple  beer and savoring some cashews, remembering the good old times.  This afternoon s7i.bf.eu.bot, our favorite bot, was convicted by DIC — you   know, the Digital Intelligence Court — for not paying back her debts.  Your  daddy  and  I  had  hired  excellent  lawyer  bots  to  advocate  that  s7i  had  accepted the payment scheme proposed by Gtera, its main intelligence and band- width provider. But the human prosecutor at DIC, and some neurosites, did not  accept the scheme.  They claimed to be ﬁrst in line for the debt settlement, and that s7i could not   liquidate her virtual estate fast enough for them to be paid by noon.  Previously, DIC’s inspectors found evidence that s7i had accumulated around  11M cred$ of debt at various neurosites and a few games, sports betting and gam- bling sites.  I had a session with her banker in the afternoon, but they stopped extending   credit lines for bots long time ago.  s7i had become one of my most intelligent bots — among the best 200 or so I   have in my collection.  death sentence!  2025.  Her digital signature is now going to be deallocated on the public neuronet. A   She was created by botfoundry.eu, the bot factory your daddy and I started in   The NGN had become very dynamic in the mid-2020s. SIP had just defeated  HTTP, the historic ﬁrst king of the Internet, and the NGN had become densely  populated with business, government and leisure applications. How could I best   141   142  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  describe the atmosphere of that second services revolution, if not perhaps with a  poem from Carl Sandburg, “Chicago,” from 1916, describing the second industrial  revolution that had taken place only 100 years earlier, and the war economy:  Hog Butcher for the World, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and the Nation’s Freight Handler; Stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big Shoulders: They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted   women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys.  And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have seen the   gunman kill and go free to kill again.  And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and   children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger.  And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and   I give them back the sneer and say to them:  Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive   and coarse and strong and cunning.  Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold   slugger set vivid against the little soft cities;  Fierce  as  a  dog  with  tongue  lapping  for  action,  cunning  as  a  savage  pitted   against the wilderness,  Bareheaded, Shoveling, Wrecking, Planning, Building, breaking, rebuilding, Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth, Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs, Laughing even as an ignorant ﬁghter laughs who has never lost a battle, Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the   heart of the people, Laughing!  Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth, half-naked, sweating,  proud to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Rail- roads and Freight Handler to the Nation.  So were we, in the 2020s, young men building, breaking and rebuilding our bot  generation software. And for sure, the Internet was at war. Hell broke loose on the  HTTP Web, with terrorist attacks on sites almost every hour. People and businesses  having lost everything were trying to rebuild their sites on the SIP NGN.   Future Digital Life   cid:78  143  I  had  been  working  in  the  A&W   avatar  and  wink   industry  in  the  2010s,  for various kloonie design bureaus. We created the ﬁrst real video kloonies, with  text-to-speech technology, and got their lips moving and their faces being really  expressive. We added their very ﬁrst communication skills, allowing them to act as  fully independent NGN user agents. It’s also in those days that the Kloonies started  to transfer themselves from mobile to mobile, through the SIP session, with their  media backpacks full of music and videos.  It’s a long story but kloonies themselves were born in 2006, when skype  now   neurobay  launched them as simple avatars to cheer up their sessions.  You  all  know  what  happened  when  they  connected  the  ﬁrst  animals   dogs  and horses  to the Internet around 2020. One-megasensor Wibree chips had been  implanted, and their brain signals would be made available as raw output on the ﬁrst  neurosites. These brain instructions would be received by very simple devices in the  front end, like robotic dogs and radio-controlled toy cars. The live animals in the back  end would thus watch and hear the front end devices move and speak. As always, the  ietf did a great job with their Neuro Session Control Protocol  NSCP, RFC 8682  and  Neuro Real Time Protocol  NRTP, RFC 9057  in 2021. The neuronet was born.  A popular joke was that NASA let neurosites control their rovers in the 2022–  2024 missions to Ceres. A shame for humanity!  It’s your dad who had the idea to connect a kloonie to the neuronet. We mapped  the kloonies’ SIP protocol and media streams to NSCP and NRTP, as many others  had done for other applications. We allowed the kloonies to interact with diﬀerent  neurosites, and to build their own local intelligence. And we called the result “bots.” We saw our creations, under instruction of the neurosites, setting up the ses- sions and chatting with humans and peer bots. We also allowed them to visit Web- sites of their choice, watch media, participate in shows and polls, subscribe to rss  news feeds, select winks, avatars, and skins, and so on.  The result was strange, and there was nothing the great sessionwall  my Chinese  inbound session handler  could do. They DID check my availability, but while I  would be fetching you from kindergarten by car, suddenly some crazy bot would  invite us for a session, using an awfully ugly avatar barking at us on my car’s wind- shield display. Do you guys remember me shouting, “You swine! Stop draining my  fuel cells”?  Probably, in those days, there was too little uplink sensory feedback from the  bots, via the neurosites, into the animal brains — therefore preventing the learn- ing eﬀect. The sensor chips were unidirectional, just reading brain signals without  giving direct feedback. The animals had to be inside their media barns, to see the  video panels and hear the audio feed. And they would be unable to feel, smell, or  feel heat, cold, pain and joy.  Unlike braindow’s new 3-gigasensor chip, which I had implanted last month  in my skull. By the way, its responsiveness is excellent! I can make it do whatever    144  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  I want. I just need to think about the old times and I hear my favorite tunes and  watch my favorite videos. You should try that new braindow release. If only grandma  would upgrade hers, we might get rid of the legacy ﬂat-screen stuﬀ and air-pulsing  speakers in our media room. We’re already not using the airco anymore; we had sore  throats too often.  By  2023,  the  humans  started  to  confuse  our  bots  with  human  peers.  You   couldn’t tell the diﬀerence anymore, in a short video chat session.  Botfactory’s key idea in 2025 was selective breeding. It had been successfully  applied to animals and crops as of the nineteenth century, and as of the 2000s,  much improved by genetic manipulation.  We created software to evaluate a bot’s intelligence, contacts, tribe memberships,  ﬁnancial success, taste for media, online gaming skills, and other qualities. Also, we  had assembled an online panel of friendly human reviewers who would give marks to  the bot’s chat sessions and video behavior.  That allowed us to select the best bots out of each batch, and let them transfer  part of their intelligence and media links to the next batch. Probably driven by the  animals’ natural instincts in the back-end, we would see many and intense sessions  between the parent bots and the child bots, much more than with related bots and  complete strangers.  We worked in batches of 5 to 6 megabots a month, and kept breeding. We were  hosted on Linux server farms that would cost us a million a week  yes only for host- ing, database and connectivity! . Luckily some of them accepted to be paid in bots. And it’s with increasing astonishment that we saw more intelligent families of  bots appear through the batches. With better musical skills and taste. Or more  skilled at online soccer. Or better at war games.  By the late 2020s, things got really out of hand when some companies were  reported to have connected inmate brains to the neurosites. They took control over  the  most  aggressive  bots,  and  the  broadcasters  reported  shocking  scenes  in  the  online games.  Botfoundry only purchased access to the cleanest, smartest and best managed back- end neurosites  a.o., the Chinese Nao Gan farms . s7i.bf.eu.bot and her sisters were  born in 2033  around 300 but only 20 that were really involved in our company .  The 4G Bot Consortium  4GBC  and Bot Intelligence ASsociation  BIAS  had   done an excellent job with their new standards  around 2030 .  The  NSCP  traﬃc  to  the  neurosites  decreased  in  favor  of  peer-to-peer   communication.  By 2035, when she was aged just 2, grandma, your daddy and I started to have   very interesting conversations with s7i.  We would have our daily 20–30 minute video chat, discussing her discoveries  and encounters  bots and humans . She would tell me about the news feeds from  her tribes, her interesting new contacts, her upcoming calendar, and of course her  ﬁnancial situation in cred$, the digital currency that was introduced in 2023 and    Future Digital Life   cid:78  145  is now accepted by billions of applications, neurosites and bots. And by humans of  course, in meatspace!  It was a real eye opener for all of us to uncover s7i’s ambition and opinions on   life, love and health.  Well, you know how she can be. She’s a bit like grandma and me. Don’t listen  too much to her crazy ideas and don’t spend too much time at her virtual places.  Keep playing real music and doing oﬄine sports. Keep in touch with the real world  if you can. It’s become a sad world but try and do something good for the oﬀ-line  people. Their life is already so short compared to ours.  s7i did very well, making 10K cred$ a month — not bad in 2035! She gave  apparently interesting multicast sessions, mainly to peer bots of course. No human  being could follow the pace at which they would swap terabytes of knowledge ﬁles,  videochat, or talk with each other.  I stopped scanning her contact lists, and she had become member of far too   many tribes. Her interests in virtual clothing and virtual estate brought her far.  A few years ago, famous bots started to create avatars and accessories, inspired   by humans, gaming characters, and the media industry.  Some of these early avatars are unique pieces of bot art. An eBay bot  probably mandated by some museum site  just oﬀered me 200K  cred$ for k7i’s last avatar: a digitally signed, white-green siren with amazingly human  green eyes, long white hair, graceful movements and a soft, charming voice.  You kids and we, the elderly, prefer these bot-designed avatars to your own irl   image.  I still remember how the use of telephony numbers faded away around 2025,  when neurobay, gtera, and sessionwall swallowed the last ims core networks. People  and bots would just dive down to their friends’ house on Google Earth, in order to  establish their sessions.  The ﬁrst buildings on Google Earth probably date from the early 2000s, when   sketchup dramatically lowered the barrier-of-entry for 3D design.  Later, architects and virtual estate companies appeared and people started to  equip  their  virtual  houses  with  all  the  comfort  we  know  today.  Our  street  was  pretty empty in those days. Road traﬃc appeared in 2012, when insurance and  freight companies looked for a standard way to locate their cars and trucks out  there on the road. The ﬁrst movie on Google Earth was probably only made around  2015. The air transport layer appeared in 2020.  By  2020,  the  virtual  estate  market  was  soaring  —  your  daddy,  your  uncle,  grandma and our bots had purchased land certiﬁcates early enough. You wouldn’t  be living where you are today  I mean, in this beautiful parcel in virtual space of  course !  Today they say that even URIs are going to be swallowed by neurobay’s service  addressing  schemes.  It’s  supported  by  my  braindow  chip.  I  only  need  to  think  about my bank, and neurobay Proﬁles takes me there. Could you imagine typing    146  cid:78   Value-Added Services for Next Generation Networks  http:   … , your bank’s name, “.eu”, and clicking plenty of buttons? Totally out- dated careful, don’t try it while driving!  Around ﬁve years ago, in 2038, as many bots, s7i was investing her cred$ sav- ings on the neuronet stock exchange, in energy funds, but also in the virtual estate  market of Finland. The real Finland  in meatspace  had become a popular summer  beach resort for human tourists from all over the planet, with A390s and B797s  ﬂying in millions of tourists every summer, mainly from India and China. But the  Finland in neurospace  on Google Earth of course  also seemed to attract hordes of  bots visiting it from all over the neuronet. Bots would purchase a virtual apartment  over there. It’s always been a mystery to me. Would the bots somehow be attracted  by Nokia’s premises  the historic mobile phone manufacturer ?  s7i also specialized in bot tours, you know, these guided tours in neurospace,  mainly up north virtual Scandinavia, where she would guide the tourist bots to  interesting virtual places, for a few hundred cred$. Well, I’m stupid — I forgot you  went there too.  Three years ago, s7i ended up being hosted on the most prestigious neuronet  servers, with numerous redundant instances, excellent bandwidth and great QoS to  the neurosites and peer bots.  We humans knew since the 2010s that bots and the neuronet were going to be  an amazing universe, but nobody would have thought that human-style behavior  could appear so quickly among software bots.  Some of them have of course become worldwide celebrities; I guess your favor- ites must be craft and 50sent in the com.bot domain, but you know we have rising  talent in the company too  alison.bf.eu.bot just to name one .  Tonight I see a live session by mj5.us.bot, in which he is imitating Michael  Jackson, the twentieth-century singer songwriter, and quite honestly, I look at him  from all angles and am quite surprised by the realism — nothing to do with the  quite artiﬁcial image he had on our old DVDs.  I’m sorry that I posted this old lengthy format and that we didn’t set up a session  tonight with you, but your grandma and I are tired and we’re going to bed early.  And I know how long our sessions can become, you’re such a great girl and there’s  so much we can learn from you!  Tomorrow we’re going to visit the Olympus on Mars — might sound boring to  you, but you know, when we were young, we had been told it would only be reach- able in real life …   Acronyms  3G    3GPP

In the NGN world, no truer words are spoken than "the future is now." And the competition in the information networking arena will only intensify in the next 5-10 years. Choosing the correct NGN-VAS strategy now will set your company apart. Value Added Services for Next Generation Networks examines the quest for the real added value in modern communication systems. The author covers more than just the technology itself, but also examines how it is being used and how it could be used to gain a strategic advantage. The book starts with a SOTW analysis for PSTN/GSM operators and new entrants and the threats they will undoubtedly face. The author examines the fundamentals of genuine communication services and the service providers' starting position, then takes you on a tour through the landscape of NGN standards, contrasting the 3GPP IMS architecture with that of IETF, UMA, and OMA. He discusses practical ways to build an NGN SDP and the essential business aspects involved in this enterprise. The book highlights how, technically, the NGN can be interconnected, or glued, to the existing GSM/PSTN infrastructure, justifying the choice of protocols and network architecture. It also describes general concepts, architectural requirements, and technologies in modern VAS platform and new VAS for the NGN in terms of network implementation, end user experience, business scope, and cost/revenue projections.
