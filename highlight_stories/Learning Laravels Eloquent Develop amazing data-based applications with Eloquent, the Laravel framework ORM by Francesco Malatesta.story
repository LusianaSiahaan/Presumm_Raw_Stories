The web runs on data, so it's essential for developers to think of quick and  effective ways to deal with it. Eloquent is an awesome ORM that comes with the  Laravel PHP framework. It is unique and is very beneficial to developers as it allows  them to define models, relationships, and many complex operations with a really  easy and intuitive syntax, without sacrificing performance. Performing an interesting  number of operations on multiple tables without writing long queries with objects  will be a bed of roses.  This book will take you through developing brilliant data-based applications with  Eloquent, the Laravel framework ORM.  You will do the following:  expressive syntax  So, let's get started!     Build highly efficient applications with the Eloquent ORM using an      Get to grips with the power of relationships and how Eloquent handles them    Go beyond simple theory with various step-by-step code examples  What this book covers Chapter 1, Setting Up Our First Project, will discuss how to deal with Composer   and Homestead. We will also cover the installation process of our very first   Laravel project. Chapter 2, Building the Database with the Schema Builder Class, will discuss the Schema  Builder Class. We will analyze everything you can do with the class, look at different  types of indexing, and learn about the methods that the Schema class provides.  [ v ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3, The Most Important Element – the Model!, will help us implement some  "create," "read," "update," and "delete" logic for our items. We will also explore   some useful methods and features of the model class. Chapter 4, Exploring the World of Relationships, will help us discover how to work with  different types of relationships and how to query and use them in a comfortable  and clean way. Also, we will learn how to insert and delete related models in our  database, or update existing ones. Chapter 5, Using Collections to Enhance Results, will talk about collections. We will  work with some results transformation methods and with the elements that make   up a collection. Chapter 6, Everything under Control with Events and Observers, will allow us to learn  everything about the events in the context of Eloquent models. Right after, we will  cover model events and model observers. Chapter 7, Eloquent… without Laravel!, will explore the structure of the database  package and see what is inside it. After that, we will learn how to install the  "illuminate database" package separately for your project and how to configure it  for its first use. Yes, exactly: Eloquent without Laravel! Chapter 8, It's Not Enough! Extending Eloquent, Advanced Concepts, will explore   two different ways to extend Eloquent, and move on to learn about the   Repository pattern.  What you need for this book This book has no specific requests about hardware or software; we will use Vagrant  to set up a standard virtual machine as a foundation for the example projects and  code snippets. So, don't worry, my friend! No long afternoons or nights will be  passed on the Apache or Nginx configuration files.  Who this book is for This book is perfect for developers with a basic knowledge of PHP development, but  who are new to the Eloquent ORM. However, developers with previous Laravel and  Eloquent experience will also benefit from the in-depth analysis of specific classes  and methodologies in the book.  [ vi ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an  explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:   "In the EventServiceProvider class, you can add a special event listener and bind it  to a certain closure."  A block of code is set as follows:    User::saved function $user      {            doing something here, after User save operation              both create and update ...     } ;  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the  screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "All you  have to do is to go on the Download page of the Composer website and find the  right method for your operating system."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ viii ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting Up Our First Project  "Chi ben comincia è a metà dell'opera."   Italian for "Well begun is half done."   Every journey has a beginning, and only a hero with the right equipment can attain a  victory. Of course, there are no exceptions for the 21st century hero: the developer!  In order to avoid problems and fight the bad  and malfunctioning  code monster,   the good code artisan will prepare everything necessary before the start.  A developer has to be comfortable with the tools they are going to use, and a   good development environment can awesomely improve the process. So, before  getting our hands dirty, in this chapter, we will discover how to deal with   Composer and Homestead.  Composer is an awesome dependency management tool, which is used by many  PHP projects around the world. Homestead is the official Laravel Vagrant box that  lets you create a fully functional development environment on a dedicated virtual  machine in a matter of minutes. Finally, we will cover the installation process of our  very first Laravel project.  I know what you are thinking: you just want to write code, code, and more code.  Be patient for a little while: if you know the tools we are going to analyze, at the   end of this chapter, you will feel an enormous difference.  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Trust me.     Your Swiss Army Knife: Composer    Your safe place: Homestead    The new hideout: Homestead improved    A bonus tool: Adminer    Your best friend: Laravel    Your first project: EloquentJourney    Summary  Your Swiss Army Knife – Composer The very first thing you will need to work with Laravel  and then Eloquent  is  Composer. Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. With this tool,   you can easily include every dependency that is needed in your project. This is   done in seconds, using a JSON configuration file named composer.json.  Usually, dependencies in a PHP project were managed with PEAR or other methods.  Composer has a different policy: everything works on a per-project basis. This means  that you can have two projects on the same server with different versions of the same  dependency package.  Installing Composer The installation procedure is ridiculously easy. All you have to do, is to go on  the Download page of the Composer website and find the right method for your  operating system.      If you have Linux or Mac, just use this: curl -sS https:  getcomposer.org installer  php  Or, if you don't have cURL, then use this: php -r "readfile 'https:  getcomposer.org installer' ;"  php  Also, the composer.phar file will be downloaded in your current directory.     On Windows, you can simply download the dedicated installer.  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Once Composer is installed, I suggest putting its path in the PATH variable of your  system, in order to use it wherever you want. There are many ways to do it, which  depend on your operating system. Let's look at each.     On Linux, you can move Composer to the right directory simply with the   following command: mv composer.phar  usr local bin composer     The same goes for OS X, but sometimes, the usr directory doesn't exist.    You must create usr local bin manually.     Finally, on Windows, you must open the control panel and type   environment variable or something similar. The search utility will do the  rest for you. Once in the right window, you will get a list of all environment  variables. Find PATH and add the composer installation path to it.  The composer.json and autoload files Before we go deep into our project, let's take a look at how Composer works.  In the composer.json file, the developer specifies every single dependency for its  project. You can also create your packages, but we are not going to look at how to  create them in this book.  So, let's say that you want to create a project that uses Monolog for logging purposes.  1.  Create a folder for the project, then create an empty text file, and name it   composer.json.  2.  Open it and all you will have to do is to include your dependency as shown:    {       "require": {           "monolog monolog": "1.12.0"       }   }  3.  After that, save the file and type the following in your project directory:  composer update  Wait a minute to download everything, and then you are done!  What? OK, here is how it works: Composer downloads every package you may  need and automatically creates a loader for all your packages. So, to use your  dependencies in your project, you will just need to include vendor autoload.php,  and you are good to go.  [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's say that you have an index.php file as a start file for your application. You will  have to perform something like the following:    <?php    index.php file      require 'vendor autoload.php' ;         your code here...  Nothing more!  Why am I showing this to you? Well, Laravel and Eloquent are Composer packages.  So, in order to use it and create a Laravel application, you have to know how the  mechanism works!  The most used commands Composer is a command-line tool. Every good CLI tool has some important  commands, and in this little section, I will show you what we are going to   use the most.     First of all, we have the following:  composer create-project  With this command, you can create a new project using a specific package   as a base. You will use this command to create a new Laravel project using  the following syntax:  composer create-project laravel laravel my_project_folder     Then, you can find: composer install  composer update  These are two similar commands; they are similar, but not the same.   When you specify your dependencies in the composer.json file, you   can use install to install them. If you already installed them but you   want to update your dependencies to a newer version, use update.  [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In order to know what must and must not be updated, Composer  uses the composer.lock file, which you can see in the root of  your project. Actually, you will never have to work with it, but it's  important to know that Composer uses it as a log of what it does.     Sometimes, you will also see this:  composer require  You can use require to include dependencies in your project on the fly.  Here's an example of Monolog inclusion using require:  composer.phar require monolog monolog:1.12.0     Another often used command is:  composer dump-autoload  This command regenerates the autoload.php file. It can be useful if you  add some classes into your projects without using namespaces or PSR  conventions and rules.     Sometimes, you will have to use  after a warning :  composer self-update  This command updates Composer itself. Just a few seconds, and you are up  and running again!     Finally, you can use the following special command:  composer global COMMAND_HERE  Use it to execute a specific command in the Composer home directory. As  I mentioned before, Composer works on a per-project basis, but sometimes  you will need to install some tools globally. With the global command, you  can do it easily.  That's all you need to know about Composer right now, and yes, there are many  other commands, but we don't need them now.  Let's take a step forward: it's time to learn about Homestead!  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Your safe place – Homestead When we start a new project, we might also stumble upon many compatibility and  environment issues. The first one to think about is the PHP version. Maybe you are  using XAMPP or some preconfigured stack on your local machine. For your new  project, you want to use PHP 5.6, but the installed version is 5.3  as you used it for  some older projects . Fine, no problem; you can just install 5.6, and you are good to go. Yes, but after two days, the phone rings. It's your old customer; finally, it's time to  make some improvements and add new features! So, you start your stack services,  browse your old project index, and BOOM! Compatibility issues, compatibility issues  everywhere! Not exactly the best way to start your day.  This is not a code problem, but an environment problem.  Actually, the best solution is to start using Vagrant. Vagrant is a fantastic tool  that lets you create a virtual machine with a headless operating system in order  to configure the virtual machine on a per-project basis. Also, you can share some  folders from your local machine with that machine, so you can work on an isolated  environment while working with your favorite IDE and operating system.  Note that the per-project basis is the most important part of the  entire thing. If you configure a separate machine for a single  project, you can tweak everything you want to reach the perfect  environment. Also, with Vagrant, you will be able to set your  local environment in the same way your production machine is  configured. So, no more local to production bugs and issues!  Last but not least, the fun  and useful  thing about Vagrant is that you can put a  specific box under version control. So, for every new team member, all you have to  do is to clone the repository and start the machine.  This looks complicated, but it is not. With Vagrant you can easily download a box    a ready-to-use virtual machine with all the tools and applications you need  and  start it with a simple command from the shell as shown:  $ vagrant up  [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Laravel community knows a couple of things about Vagrant and makes up a  Vagrant Box to help you in your job.  Homestead is the official Vagrant Box for Laravel and already has everything you  need to get started. You will find it  already installed and working , by default:  Ubuntu 14.04 PHP 5.6 HHVM nginx MySQL PostgreSQL  Node  with Bower, Grunt, and Gulp  Redis Memcached Beanstalkd Laravel Envoy Fabric + Hipchat Extension  Not too bad for a tool box that you can prepare in a matter of minutes!  Now let's stop discussing and install Homestead.  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Installing Homestead First of all, ensure that you have already installed VirtualBox  https:  www. virtualbox.org   and Vagrant  https:  www.vagrantup.com  . You can install  them on every operating system, so feel free to use whichever you want.  If you want to work with a good shell on Windows, I suggest   you use Cmder  http:  bliker.github.io cmder  .   While writing this book, I referred to the same link.  Next, we can add Homestead to our local boxes. This means that Vagrant will  download the Homestead box in order to be used locally.  You can do it with a simple command:  vagrant box add laravel homestead  You will have to wait a couple of minutes to download the box. So, if you want to  have a coffee, this is the perfect moment.  Here, you don't have to worry about where Vagrant is placing the box,  as it is going to save it locally in the Vagrant folder. In the future, every  time you will need a specific box, Vagrant will clone and use it.  Alright, your box is now on your local machine and ready to be started.   However, accordingly to your local machine settings, you can install Homestead   in two different ways. They are both present in the official Laravel documentation,   so they are both official.  The Composer and PHP tool way Let's start with the first one: it is a perfect choice if you already have Composer   and PHP on your local machine. Note that you are only going to do these steps the   first time.  Use this command to install the Homestead CLI tool.  composer global require "laravel homestead=~2.0"  Then, be sure to put the ~ .composer vendor bin directory in the PATH  environment variable, in order to use the tool wherever you want.  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After that, you can initialize your machine. Use the init command:  homestead init  This will create a ~ .homestead folder with a Homestead.yaml inside of it. This file  will be used by Vagrant at the virtual machine start.  The Git way If you don't have PHP and Composer installed on your local machine  or maybe you  just don't want to use them , no problem. You can simply use Git.  Choose a folder where you want to save your virtual machine. Then, clone the  repository with:  git clone https:  github.com laravel homestead.git HomesteadFolder  Here, HomesteadFolder is the place you chose for your VM files. After the   clone process, use cd to get into the folder and start the init script using the  following command:  bash init.sh  This script will create a Homestead.yaml file in a ~ .homestead directory,   and that's it!  The following steps for installation are the same for both the methods you just saw.  Configuring Homestead Before we go forward, let's take a look at the default Homestead.yaml file.    ---   ip: "192.168.10.10"   memory: 2048   cpus: 1  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     authorize: ~ .ssh id_rsa.pub    keys:       - ~ .ssh id_rsa    folders:       - map: ~ Code         to:  home vagrant Code    sites:       - map: homestead.app         to:  home vagrant Code Laravel public    databases:       - homestead    variables:       - key: APP_ENV         value: local  If you are unfamiliar with this syntax, no problem; it's a simple YAML  YAML ain't  a markup language  markup file. It is a very readable way to specify settings, and  Homestead uses it. Here, you can choose the IP address for your virtual machine and  other settings. Tweak the configuration file accordingly to your needs.  1.  Do you see the authorize property in the Homestead.yaml file? Well, we   are going to set up our SSH key and put its path there. If it scares you, don't  worry; it is just a command. ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "you@homestead"  If you are using Windows, the Laravel documentation recommends   Git Bash. Personally, as I mentioned before, I prefer to use Cmder.   However, you can also use PuTTY or whatever you want. Use ssh-keygen  –t rsa –C "you@homestead" to generate your ssh key. This is shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 10 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Put the generated SSH key path in the authorize property of Homestead.  yaml, as shown in the following: authorize: ~ .ssh id_rsa.pub  Done? Good. Now, you can see a folders property as well.  As I mentioned before, Vagrant lets the developer share some folders  between the local and virtual machines. What is the point of that? Well, it is really important because with  this system we can work on our project on a separate machine,  while being able to use whatever IDE or tool we want from our local  machine. For example, even if the VM has Ubuntu, I can easily use  Windows 8.1 and PHPStorm. The best of both worlds!  3.  By default, Homestead suggests this structure:  folders:       - map: ~ Code         to:  home vagrant Code  Also, this means that you will have to create a Code folder in your user  folder. This local folder will be mapped to a  home vagrant Code folder   on the VM; every change that you make there will be reflected on the virtual  machine and vice versa.  You can customize this mapping to your needs.  4.  Next, let's take a look at the sites property. Here's what you can see in a   default setup:   sites:       - map: homestead.app         to:  home vagrant Code Laravel public  You can define a custom domain for every project, which is a really  comfortable way to work with your projects, as you will no longer need to  test your project with an IP  like 192.168.10.10 , only a simple local domain,  such as myproject.dev.  [ 11 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   5.  This is a good point to define a separate site for our project. So, feel free to   add these lines to your file:   - map: eloquent.dev       to:  home vagrant Code EloquentJourney public  6.  Next, go to your host's file  on the host machine  and add this record:    192.168.10.10 eloquent.dev  You can see how you need to add it in the following screenshot:  Of course, you have to insert the same IP you specified in the  Homestead.yaml file.  7.  The last thing we are going to see here is the database property. For every   name you add here, Homestead will automatically create a database to work  with. So, edit the property to something like this:   databases:       - homestead       - eloquent_journey  This is because we are going to use a separate eloquent_journey MySQL database  for our test application.  [ 12 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The default username for the MySQL server is homestead,  and the default password is secret.  We have nothing more to do here; our setup is complete, and now we are ready to  boot up our virtual machine and use it.  The new hideout: Homestead improved Even if Homestead is a fantastic box, many people complain about some of its  structural choices. As I mentioned previously, Vagrant is used to create virtual  machines on a per-project basis. This means that, in an ideal situation, every project  must have its own VM. Now, with Homestead, you can create a single VM and  manage all your projects on it. Some people like this idea, and it is more familiar to  the classical XAMPP approach. Quite familiar! However, other people like a more pure approach to Vagrant. While doing   some researches on this concept, I stumbled upon Homestead Improved    https:  github.com Swader homestead_improved  by Swader, on GitHub. It is an improved version of Homestead that you can install and run without saving  files all around your user folder. A really good approach! Also, you won't have to  configure any SSH keys or execute apt-get update and composer auto-update.  Everything will be done automatically.  If you want to use Homestead Improved, just open your terminal and type the  following:  git clone https:  github.com Swader homestead_improved.git  MyHomesteadImprovedVM  Here, MyHomesteadImprovedVM will be the containing folder of all the VM's files.  After the clone procedure, just type the following:  vagrant up  So, you're done! Easier than before, isn't it?  [ 13 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A bonus tool – Adminer Before going deeper along our journey, there is another really useful tool that I want  to show you. I am talking about Adminer, a Database Management tool entirely  contained in a single .php file. You can download it at http:  www.adminer.org .  Maybe you will find the Adminer interface very similar to the phpMyAdmin  interface. It's true, but Adminer has more features. Just to make a simple example,  phpMyAdmin only supports MySQL. Instead, Adminer supports MySQL,  PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MS SQL.  Obviously, you can use whatever you want to deal with your database. However,  I wanted to show you Adminer because it is what I am going to use to show, from  time to time, some query results or various examples. So, it would be good if you get  more familiar with this tool.  Your best friend: Laravel We are close to the end. You have a weapon  Composer  and a safe place to do  everything you want without worrying about issues  Homestead . What about an  ally? Laravel could be a good one, don't you think? Also, Laravel is the Eloquent  container: we are going to create a new project with it to fully embrace its power.  [ 14 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Installing Laravel Before going further, remember that Laravel has some prerequisites. You will need  the following:     PHP 5.4  or more recent versions     The PHP Mcrypt extension    The PHP OpenSSL extension    The PHP Mbstring extension  If you are using PHP 5.5, you may need to install the JSON PHP  extension. If this is the case, just type this: apt-get install php5-json So, you are good to go.  Obviously, if you have installed Homestead, everything is already in its right place.  1.  All you have to do is to boot up the VM with the following command:  2.  And when the bootstrap procedure is done, use the following command to   homestead up  get in the machine via SSH:  homestead ssh  Having said that, as you may have experienced from Homestead, Laravel also gives  you two different ways to install it and create a new project.     The first one is done using a specific tool, the Laravel installer tool. It's a CLI   tool that you can install as a global Composer package.     The second one is a simple composer create-project command.    Of course, we will now see both ways.  Using the Laravel installer tool The Laravel installer tool is a nice utility that lets you create a new Laravel project  with a very simple syntax. Imagine that you want to create a new project in a folder  called my_project. All you have to do, if you have the tool installed, is to type this  and nothing more:  laravel new my_project  [ 15 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Installing the tool is easy. Just open the terminal and type the following:  composer global require "laravel installer=~1.1"  As you saw before, we are executing the require command with the global  keyword. This means that the installer tool package will be saved in the Composer's  global folder and the tool will be available everywhere.  If you have any problems running the tool, just be sure to put  ~ .composer vendor bin in the PATH environment variable.  Otherwise, it won't work!  Using the Composer create-project command If you don't want to install the Laravel installer tool, you can simply use the   create-project command of Composer.  All you have to do, in this case, is use this command:  composer create-project laravel laravel ProjectName  Here, ProjectName stands for the folder name that you want to use as the root of  your new Laravel project.  Nothing more to do here! Your Laravel project is now fully installed in your  specified folder.  Be sure to configure the right permissions on your folders and  ensure you take a good look at the URL rewriting rules. If you take  a look at the Laravel-dedicated documentation page  http:   laravel.com docs 5.0 installationpretty-urls , you  can learn how to do it on Apache or nginx.  The first project – EloquentJourney A new project will be the perfect metaphor for our new, fantastic journey! While  studying Eloquent, we will build a simple project. More specifically, we will analyze  a hypothetical library management system's data-related part and its components.  [ 16 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   What are you waiting for? Let's start! First of all, create a new project  using your  favorite method . We will call our new project EloquentJourney. Type the following  in your server folder:  laravel new EloquentJourney  Otherwise, type the following if you prefer:  composer create-project laravel laravel EloquentJourney  Wait a few seconds to build the project, and after the installation procedure, you are  done! You can use cd to get into your new folder and see what's there.  Cool! All right, but what are we going to do now? There are thousands of files here  and in other subfolders! Don't worry. Take a breath and follow me. First of all, we  need to do some practice with the Laravel configuration system in order to set up an  appropriate database connection.  Without it, we could not use Eloquent!  The configuration system Everything you could need on configuration is stored in the config directory. Every  file here has quite a descriptive name: app.php, database.php, filesystems.php,  cache.php, and so on. Actually, we are going to use two of these files: app.php, for  some basic settings, and database.php, for obvious reasons.  First of all, let's open the app.php file and see what you can find inside.  <?php  return [    'debug' => true,    'url' => 'http:  localhost',    'timezone' => 'Europe Rome',    'locale' => 'en',    'fallback_locale' => 'en',  [ 17 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     'key' => env 'APP_KEY', 'SomeRandomString' ,    'cipher' => MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128,    'log' => 'daily',       other items here...  ];  A Laravel config file contains a return instruction. The returned value is an  associative array. As you can easily imagine, the key-value system represents the  configuration item name and its value. For example, let's examine the first item:    'debug' => true,  This means that the app.debug configuration item is set on the Boolean value true.  Laravel uses these values all around the framework code, and you can use them too  with the \Config class.  Specifically, if you want to retrieve a specific item value, you have to call the get    method, as follows:    $myItem = \Config::get 'item.name' ;   var_dump $myItem ;       true  You can also set a specific Config value at runtime, this time using the set    method, as follows:    \Config::set 'item.name', 'my value!' ;    $myItem = \Config::get 'item.name' ;   var_dump $myItem ;       "my value!"  [ 18 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up the database connection Yes, we finally arrived at the end of this chapter. The last thing we need to do here,   is to set up the database connection.  Let's open the database.php file under config. You should see something like this:  <?php  return [    'fetch' => PDO::FETCH_CLASS,    'default' => 'mysql',    'connections' => [      'sqlite' => [       'driver'   => 'sqlite',       'database' => storage_path  .' database.sqlite',       'prefix'   => '',     ],      'mysql' => [       'driver'    => 'mysql',       'host'      => 'localhost',       'database'  => 'homestead',       'username'  => 'homestead',       'password'  => 'secret',       'charset'   => 'utf8',       'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',       'prefix'    => '',       'strict'    => false,     ],      'pgsql' => [       'driver'   => 'pgsql',       'host'     => env 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' ,       'database' => env 'DB_DATABASE', 'forge' ,       'username' => env 'DB_USERNAME', 'forge' ,       'password' => env 'DB_PASSWORD', '' ,       'charset'  => 'utf8',  [ 19 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         'prefix'   => '',       'schema'   => 'public',     ],      'sqlsrv' => [       'driver'   => 'sqlsrv',       'host'     => env 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' ,       'database' => env 'DB_DATABASE', 'forge' ,       'username' => env 'DB_USERNAME', 'forge' ,       'password' => env 'DB_PASSWORD', '' ,       'prefix'   => '',     ],    'migrations' => 'migrations',    'redis' => [      'cluster' => false,      'default' => [       'host'     => '127.0.0.1',       'port'     => 6379,       'database' => 0,     ],    ],    ],  ];  The two most important items are default and connections. In this second item,  connections, we are storing all the information we need to connect to our databases.  By default, you will find many examples. In fact, here you can see the sqlite, then  mysql, and also sqlsrv connections.  Every connection has a driver. The driver element indicates the used database  for that connection. If you want, you can specify more than one connection, when  necessary. The default element represents the chosen connection.  [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's delete everything and replace the default and connections elements with   the following:    'default' => 'eloquentJourney',    'connections' => [      'eloquentJourney' => [       'driver'    => 'mysql',       'host'      => 'localhost',       'database'  => 'eloquent_journey',       'username'  => 'homestead',       'password'  => 'secret',       'charset'   => 'utf8',       'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',       'prefix'    => '',       'strict'    => false,     ],   ],  What did we just do?  Quite simple! We have defined an eloquentJourney connection. This connection  will use the mysql driver. So, we are going to connect Laravel to a MySQL server.   I am not going to explain the other properties, as it is really easy to understand   their meanings.  After that, we specified the connection name as the default option. This means that,  for every future call to a database-related operation, Laravel will connect to the  server specified in the eloquentJourney connection with the given credentials.  Summary We did it!  We prepared everything that is needed to work with Laravel and Eloquent. We set  up a local development server, learned the basics of Composer to correctly manage  our dependencies, installed a couple of more useful tools, and, finally, successfully  configured our database connection. Not bad for the first chapter, huh?  However, we have just begun, and our journey inside Eloquent is at the very  beginning. We are ready to leave our safe house, go into the darkest corner of the  Eloquent ORM to explore it, and understand all of its secrets.  It will be a great ride. And now, let's explore our first topic on our way: the Schema  Builder and the migrations system, to build the perfect database!  [ 21 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Building the Database with  the Schema Builder Class  Hey hero!  Our development environment is now ready. No more worries, and a whole new  world awaits: the hero left his home. Little by little, step by step, he is going forward  toward the goal. The hero knows what is really important: to stay grounded. Having  a good foundation helps. No big differences for an application: a well-designed  database for your project is always the best start.  Starting from this important assumption, the question naturally arises: is there a  way, with Laravel, to deal with the design of a database before using it, maybe in a  smart way that you can easily manage? The answer is, as you can imagine, yes.  In this chapter, we will look at the Schema Builder class. A very important class  that lets you design your entire database without writing a single SQL line! Quite  impressive if you think about it, considering that it is quite possible that you will  build your entire application on a SQL database without using SQL! We will analyze  everything you can do with the class: creating, dropping, and updating a table;  adding, removing, and renaming columns. Also, we will look at indexing in many  ways: not only simple indexes but also unique indexes and foreign keys. Also, we are  going to look at some methods that the Schema class provides in order to have a real  and total control over everything. Sometimes, you will need to be sure about what  exists in your database!  After all this stuff, it is not be over yet. In fact, we will explore the world of  migrations, which is something Laravel uses to do versioning of your database.  Combining the power of the Schema class with the migrations system will give  you great power over your data design. Also, it will be very easy to share your  application with another new member of your team! You know that versioning is  always the best choice.  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An important note before going forward: even if the Schema Builder class and  migrations system are not tightly related to Eloquent, they easily create a database  with a structure that fits perfectly for the Eloquent standards and conventions. Also,  the Schema Builder and migrations system are a part of the illuminate database   https:  github.com illuminate database  package; yes, the same package  from Eloquent! Let's go.     The Schema Builder class    Database versioning with the migrations system  The Schema Builder class The Schema Builder class is a tool that provides you with a database agnostic way to  deal with your database design. The term database agnostic means that you will never  have to worry about what database you are using: the only important thing is to use  the right driver, as we saw before in the configuration part of the first chapter. So, if  you think of switching your database system from SQLite to MySQL or SQL Server,  don't worry: you will always have your structure ready to be used.  In the first part of this chapter, we will use some simple routes. All you have to do is  to add them to the app routes.php file.  Working with tables Let's start with the very, very basic phenomena. The following is the  Schema::create   method that you can use to create a new table in your database:  The create   method accepts two parameters: the first method is the name of the  table you want to create, and the second method is a closure where we will specify  all the table fields. To be more precise, the closure parameter is a Blueprint object.  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When possible, I like to use type-hinting for a better code readability.  So, you may read something like this:  Schema::create 'users', function Blueprint $table  { $table->increments 'id' ; } ;  Don't worry, it's the same.  You will also be able to rename a table: in this case, just use the rename   method.  Schema::rename $previousName, $newName ;  Finally, what about dropping a table? The method drop   is here for you.    Schema::drop $tableName ;  There is also a similar method, dropIfExists  , with the same syntax.    Schema::dropIfExists $tableName ;  As the awesomely expressive name suggests, the method drops the table only if it  exists in the database.  I often use this method instead of the simple drop   method.  Remember that if you want to check if a table exists, you can use the hasTable    method, as follows:    if  Schema::hasTable 'books'      {         the table "books" exists...   }  Now, let's take a look at how you can work with table columns.  [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Working with columns Working with columns is quite easy. First of all, let's see how to create new columns  while adding a new table to the database.  As I told you before, we will use the $table parameter of Schema::create  .    Schema::create 'books', function Blueprint $table    {       $table->increments 'id' ;        $table->string 'title' ;        $table->integer 'pages_count' ;       $table->decimal 'price', 5, 2 ;              $table->text 'description' ;        $table->timestamps  ;   } ;  The Blueprint $table object has many methods, which are related to the creation  of a single new column. You can easily see that all the methods' names represent  a specific type of column. For example, string is the equivalent of VARCHAR on  MySQL, and integer is the equivalent of INT.  There are also some utility methods: if you take a look at the very first code line of  the closure, you will read an increments   method. Nothing complex, however, it  just creates an id integer field  also setting it as a primary key  with autoincrement.  Finally, you can see the timestamps   method in the last line. The Schema Builder  class also has methods that are related to some Eloquent functionalities. In this case,  the timestamps   method automatically creates two DATETIME equivalent fields,  named created_at and updated_at. They can be quite useful if you want to track  the time of insert and last update operations.  Now, why don't we make some tests, before going further?  It's a matter of seconds: just create a new GET route in the app routes.php file and  add that Schema::create   method we saw like this:       remember this "use" directive!   use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;    Route::get 'create_books_table', function  {      Schema::create 'books', function Blueprint $table      {  [ 26 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           $table->increments 'id' ;          $table->string 'title', 30 ;          $table->integer 'pages_count' ;         $table->decimal 'price', 5, 2 ;          $table->text 'description' ;          $table->timestamps  ;     } ;    } ;  We will create a table named books on our database. This table will have   seven columns:     The unique, primary key id as an integer    The title column as a string  with 30 characters maximum     The pages_count integer column    The price decimal column    The description text column    The created_at and updated_at columns, created by the    timestamps   method  Let's navigate to the  create_books_table URL and then open your Adminer  or  whatever tool you like to deal with your database  to verify if everything went well.  This is the result!  [ 27 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Good job! Let's take a look at the structure.  Perfect. Exactly what we wanted—without a single SQL line!  Note that as we had done before for tables, we can also check if a specific column  exists with the hasColumn   method:    if  Schema::hasColumn 'books', 'title'      {         the column "title" in the "books" table exists...   }  Columns' methods reference Here's a quick reference for all the methods you can use on the Blueprint   $table instance:  Method $table->bigIncrements 'id' ;  $table->bigInteger 'votes' ; $table->binary 'data' ; $table->boolean 'confirmed' ; $table->char 'name', 4 ; $table->date 'created_at' ; $table->dateTime 'created_at' ;  Description Incrementing ID using a big integer  equivalent BIGINT equivalent to the table BLOB equivalent to the table BOOLEAN equivalent to the table CHAR equivalent with the length DATE equivalent to the table DATETIME equivalent to the table  [ 28 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Method $table->decimal 'amount', 5, 2 ;  $table->double 'column', 15, 8 ;  $table->enum 'choices', ['foo',  'bar'] ; $table->float 'amount' ; $table->increments 'id' ;  $table->integer 'votes' ; $table->json 'options' ; $table->longText 'description' ; $table->mediumInteger 'numbers' ; $table- >mediumText 'description' ; $table->nullableTimestamps  ;  $table->smallInteger 'votes' ; $table->tinyInteger 'numbers' ; $table->string 'email' ; $table->string 'name', 100 ;  $table->text 'description' ;  Description DECIMAL equivalent with a precision  and scale DOUBLE equivalent with precision, 15  digits in total and 8 after the decimal  point ENUM equivalent to the table  FLOAT equivalent to the table Incrementing ID to the table  primary  key  INTEGER equivalent to the table JSON equivalent to the table LONGTEXT equivalent to the table MEDIUMINT equivalent to the table MEDIUMTEXT equivalent to the table  Same as timestamps  , except the  fact that this allows NULLs SMALLINT equivalent to the table TINYINT equivalent to the table VARCHAR equivalent column VARCHAR equivalent with the length  of a string TEXT equivalent to the table  You can also find the complete reference in the Laravel official  documentation, at the http:  laravel.com docs 5.0  schemaadding-columns page.  Other $table object methods If you take a look at the methods reference in the Laravel documentation, you will  probably see some more than in the list you just saw.  The first methods reference is:    $table->timestamps  ;  [ 29 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I already used this in the example. It creates the table timestamps created_at and  updated_at columns, which are really useful if you want to track chronological  information about the creation or update of a specific record.  Eloquent also manages timestamps columns automatically, so you don't have to  worry about them in your code.  Another important  and really similar  method is as follows:    $table->softDeletes  ;  It is used to add a deleted_at column to the desired table.  Sometimes, in your applications, it is really useful to keep some information even  if you don't want to show it to the final user. Think about an e-commerce orders'  history: the customer can choose to clean his history but you can't allow him her to  physically delete records!  The soft delete system solves this problem by adding a deleted_at column to a   table in order to keep track of the delete date of a record.  Eloquent handles this system automatically, so you will be able to show a clean  history to your customer and a complete list of orders to the shop administrator.  Next, you can see this:    $table->rememberToken  ;  This method adds a remember_token column.  The Laravel authentication system uses this token  a simple VARCHAR 100  to track  the user status. It is used when you click on a Remember Me checkbox in the login  page of your application.  There are also some methods you can chain after some table columns' definitions.  If you want to make a numeric column unsigned, use the following:    $table->integer 'my_column' ->unsigned  ;  Of course, you can use it with every numeric field  float, decimal, and so on .  You can also specify if a column is nullable with nullable  :    $table->string 'my_column' ->nullable  ;  [ 30 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you want to specify a default value, you can use the following:    $table->string 'my_column' ->default 'my_default_value' ;  Sometimes, you will need to use BIGINT or equivalent for your  primary keys. If this is the case, use bigIncrements   instead  of increments    that uses INT or equivalent .  Updating tables and columns What? Yeah, I know what you are thinking—what if I have to add a book   named The Awesome Super Life of the Marvelous Francesco Malatesta?   It's a 60-character-long name!  Things change, so our database will have to change too. In a simple way, though.  You will use the table method to update an existing one.  Here you can see an example:    Schema::table 'table_name', function Blueprint $table    {        update operations here...   } ;  So, let's make a little update. Create a new route in our routes file and name it  update_books_table:    Route::get 'update_books_table', function  {        Schema::table 'books', function Blueprint $table        {           $table->string 'title', 250 ->change  ;       } ;    } ;  Note that we used the change   method right after the string   method.   You will use change   on changing a column. If you simply want to add a new  column to an existing table, just use this as usual:    $table->string 'title', 250 ;  [ 31 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You will need the doctrine dbal package to change columns. To  obtain it, just add the doctrine dbal to your composer.json file:  2.5.0 dependency. Then, type composer update in your terminal and you are good to go.  Browse to the new URL and update the table. Now you will be able to add my  awesome biography to your library in the future. Be proud of it.  Indexes and foreign keys Let's take another step forward. Let's imagine that we are upgrading our application  and we want to add the possibility to store book authors and related data.   Also, we will give the possibility to the user to search a book by its title.  We would have to do a couple of the following things:     Create the authors table to store authors' data    Update the books table to insert an external foreign key and an index to the   title column  You already know how to update an existing table but what about indexing columns  and creating foreign keys?  Adding indexes is quite easy with the Schema Builder. There are some expressive  methods you can use.  First of all, you can create a primary key with the primary   method. The parameter  is the field you want to index.    $table->primary 'id' ;  If you need, you can specify an array of columns as a single index.    $table->primary ['first_name', 'last_name', 'document_number'] ;  The method unique   is used to create a unique key:    $table->unique 'email' ;  Finally, if you want to add a simple index, you can use the index   method!    $table->index 'title' ;  [ 32 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You can also add a foreign key, if you need. In the following example, we are  referencing the author_id column  on a hypothetical books table, maybe  to the id  column in the authors table.    $table->foreign 'author_id' ->references 'id' ->on 'authors' ;  Specifying onDelete and onUpdate constraint operations is not a problem.    $table->foreign 'author_id'        ->references 'id'        ->on 'authors'        ->onDelete 'cascade' ;  If you don't need your indexes anymore, you can easily drop them:    $table->dropPrimary 'authors_id_primary' ;   $table->dropUnique 'authors_email_unique' ;   $table->dropIndex 'books_title_index' ;   $table->dropForeign 'books_author_id_foreign' ;  The convention used to create an index name is   table-name_column-name_index-type.  Alright, now that you have a good overview of indexes with the Schema Builder  class, let's add the new functionality to our example.  Create a new GET route. This time it is named update_books_table_2.    Route::get 'update_books_table_2', function  {           creating the authors table...       Schema::create 'authors', function Blueprint $table        {           $table->increments 'id' ;            $table->string 'first_name' ;           $table->string 'last_name' ;            $table->timestamps  ;       } ;        Schema::table 'books', function Blueprint $table        {  [ 33 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                creating the index on the title column...           $table->index 'title' ;               creating the foreign key...           $table->integer 'author_id' ->unsigned  ;           $table->foreign 'author_id' ->references 'id' - >on 'authors' ;       } ;    } ;  That's all! Let's verify all with Adminer, as we did before:  Yeah! It worked.  [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Database versioning with the migrations  system Until this point, we worked with the Schema class using some simple routes.   Quite easy, but it's not a very good practice. You know: the single responsibility  principle is not just a bedtime story.  Also, it's not just about the code: the database too should have a fully functional  version control system in order to keep track of all the updates and facilitate a new  member in your team.  Well, the migrations system is here to help. You can see it as a version control system  for your database, which is made up of many files. Every single one of these files is  a class with the two methods: up   and down  . In the up   method, you will put  all of your database construction logic. In the down   method, instead, you will put  anything related to rolling back what you did in the up   method.  Creating migrations Let's make the first basic example. We already have the books and authors tables.  Imagine that we want to gather data about our books' publishers.  We will have to:     Create a new table called publishers, with at least the name of the publisher    Create a new foreign key publisher_id in books  Let's make it with a migration file! Open your terminal and type the following:    php artisan make:migration publishers_update  Wait for a few seconds and then go to the database migrations folder. You will  find a file named like this:    2015_03_06_105131_publishers_update.php  Open it. This class already has empty up   and down   methods:    <?php      use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;     use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;      class PublishersUpdate extends Migration {  [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         public function up         {              }        public function down         {                  }      }    <?php  Now, fill them with some Schema Builder instructions, like this.      use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;     use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;      class PublishersUpdate extends Migration {        public function up         {         Schema::create 'publishers', function Blueprint $table          {           $table->increments 'id' ;            $table->string 'name' ;            $table->timestamps  ;         } ;          Schema::table 'books', function Blueprint $table          {           $table->integer 'publisher_id' ->unsigned  ;           $table->foreign 'publisher_id' ->references             'id' ->on 'publishers' ;         } ;       }        public function down         {         Schema::table 'books', function Blueprint $table          {           $table->dropForeign 'books_publisher_id_foreign' ;  [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             $table->dropColumn 'publisher_id' ;         } ;          Schema::drop 'publishers' ;       }      }  Quite linear: what we do in up   we undo in down  . Of course, in the reverse order.  Remember, it's a mirror operation! Now, it's time to run your migrations. All you have to do is run php artisan  migrate; it loads all the migration classes and executes their up   method. In this  way, you can build your database accordingly to your files. The execution order is  decided by the file name. The file we just created is named 2015_03_06_105131_ publishers_update.php.  This means that this file was created on March 6, 2015 at 10:51:31. As you can easily  imagine, all the migrations will be executed in a chronological order. To make  things clearer, delete the two 2014_10_12_000000_create_users_table.php and  2014_10_12_100000_create_password_resets_table.php. We won't need them.  Return to your terminal and type:    php artisan migrate  Wait for a few seconds and you will get an output really similar to the following:    Migration table created successfully.   Migrated: 2015_03_06_105131_publishers_update  Now, return to your database. The update was done successfully, but we have  another new table: the migrations table. Laravel uses this table to keep track of  every update to the database. So, if you make another update to your application   with another new migration  and you run again the php artisan migrate  command, you will execute only the new migrations and not the old ones.   Exactly, version control, as I mentioned before.  Rolling back migrations Let's try this rollback thing right now. In your terminal, type    php artisan migrate:rollback  Then, go back to your database: no more publishers table and no more related  foreign key! Cool!  [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Got it? Good. Now, type this again:    php artisan migrate  Let's go forward.  You could get a class not found error while executing the php  artisan migrate command. Don't worry, just type composer dump-autoload in your terminal  and try again! Even the best, sometimes, make mistakes.  More examples, more migrations Now, what about another example?  Let's imagine another feature. Alright, I have an idea: imagine that you want to  specify some tags for every book you store with your application. This time you   will have two things to do:     Create a new tags table to store tags.    Create a new book_tag table, as we are going to represent a many-to-many   relationship. In this table, you will find the book_id and tag_id.  First of all, create a new migration. Open your terminal and type:    php artisan make:migration tags_update  Also, update the file as the following:    <?php      use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;     use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;      class TagsUpdate extends Migration {         **        * Run the migrations.        *        * @return void        *        public function up         {         Schema::create 'tags', function Blueprint $table   [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           {           $table->increments 'id' ;            $table->string 'name' ;            $table->timestamps  ;         } ;          Schema::create 'book_tag', function Blueprint $table          {           $table->increments 'id' ;            $table->integer 'book_id' ->unsigned  ;           $table->integer 'tag_id' ->unsigned  ;            $table->foreign 'book_id' ->references             'id' ->on 'books' ;           $table->foreign 'tag_id' ->references 'id' ->on 'tags' ;         } ;       }         **        * Reverse the migrations.        *        * @return void        *        public function down         {         Schema::drop 'book_tag' ;         Schema::drop 'tags' ;       }      }  I like to write in the up   and down   methods at the same time.  In that example you just saw, I put in up   the create method  for tags. Then, I passed to the down   method and added the  drop 'tags'  method call. Then, I went back to up   and added  the book_tag table, and I finally went to down   again to drop the  book_tag table. Working in this way helps me reduce distraction errors.  Now, open the terminal and type:    php artisan migrate  [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Go to your database. Open the migrations table to see what happened:  We have two different batches here. The first batch  1  is related to the publisher's  update. The second batch  2  is related to the tags system update.  Why am I telling this to you? Who cares?  Well, when you type php artisan migrate:rollback in your terminal, the  migrations system searches for the last batch and rolls it back. Not every batch, just  the last batch. This means that the first rollback command will undo everything  related to the tags system. If you type it again, the migrations system will also undo  everything about the publisher's update.  With the batch number, you can know how many iterations you did on your  database. However, there is another important thing you need to know: regarding  our example, if you roll back two times and then migrate again, both migration files  will be grouped under batch 1.  Also, you can roll back everything with this:    php artisan migrate:reset  You can roll back and migrate everything again with this:    php artisan migrate:refresh  Finally, you will get a list of all the migrated rolled back migrations with this:    php artisan migrate:status  That's all! With this last command, we are also done with migrations.  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary Finally, the hero leaves his home. After the training and obtaining the right  foundations, he is really ready to go.  Remember that the Schema Builder class and migrations system are not just about  building your DB. In this chapter, you learned how to improve your database design  method in a smarter way without the need for a single SQL line. Also, by using  migrations, you are not going to need anymore to download database dumps or, in  some extreme way, install any extra tool to deal with it. Everything is done with the artisan migrate commands. However, as I already  told you, this was just a sample. The real thing is arriving. In the next chapter, we will go deeply and straight into the most important and  atomic Eloquent component: the model.  Are you ready, hero?  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   The Most Important   Element – the Model!  Finally, I can say it: things are getting really, really serious from this moment. In the  previous chapters, you studied everything you needed to make a start. Maybe it was  a little annoying, but you knew that you would need it. Now, stop talking about the  past; it's over. In this chapter, many amazing things await.  As you can imagine by the title, this part is going to be about the most important and  atomic Eloquent element: the model. We will analyze the M in MVC. Considering  that you are reading a book about creating a data-based application, exactly, really  important! However, I don't want to bore you anymore. Let's talk about what we are  going to see in the next sections. Usually, there is a standard way to look at the Eloquent documentation. It's the same  as you can see on the Laravel site. In my initial Laravel days, I used those pages but I  felt a little incomplete. So, I changed things a little bit but in a more simplified way. If  you have ever developed a web application in your life, I'm quite sure that you made  a data-based application with tables and records. Right? Well...  If you think about it, you can do four basic operations on them. Whenever you  develop an application, there's a very high possibility that you are going to  implement some create, read, update, and delete logic for your items. This is exactly  what we are going to see in this chapter.  First of all, we will introduce the simple, basic model. It will be a single line of  code! Then, we will talk about CRUD  create, read, update, and delete  operations  with Eloquent. After that point, you will have all the basics and an overview of the  mechanism. We will also deal with the where   method and everything related,  unscrambling everything about conditions and selections.  [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After that, we will go deep into the Model class, studying the mass assignment   as another way to store and update our data. Then, we will discuss timestamps   and soft deletes, and find out how Laravel and Eloquent deal with dates. After  that, you will learn about query scopes and how to use them to improve your  development process.  Also, we will take a look at many cool methods to transform our data in order to  be shown  or stored  correctly: attributes casting, mutators, date mutators, and  accessors. If that isn't enough, we will explore all the Model-related events that you  can use to introduce new behaviors in your code without breaking it. Also, Model  observers will be analyzed when an event isn't enough.  In the last part of this chapter, we will explore some useful methods and features of  the Model class, diving directly into the basic Model class code! Not bad, huh? Let's  start! Here are the topics:     Creating a Model    Create, read, update, and delete operations basics    Where, aggregates, and other utilities    Mass assignment – for the masses    Query scopes    Attributes casting, accessors, and mutators    Model events and observers    Descending in the code  Creating a Model First of all, let's see how you can create a Model and how its basic structure is made.  The fastest way to create a Model is to use the following command, with a parameter  that you can use to specify the model name:  php artisan make:model  So, let's imagine that you want to create a Book model. The steps are as follows:  1.  All you have to do is use the following command:  php artisan make:model Book Of course, you can also create it manually; usually, Laravel puts Models in  the app folder.  [ 44 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Once you have done this, let's open the Book.php file under app to see    what's inside.  Wait. What? An empty class? Seriously?  Yes.  Laravel is designed to create a great web application in very little time. Eloquent   and its models  are no exceptions. The class you can see here is ready to be used in  your application; using it, you will be able to do everything related to your books.  Talking about SQL databases, you can think of a connection between every   model and table. If you respect a certain convention, Laravel automatically guesses  the table name starting from the model name. So, if I have a model by the name of  Book, Laravel will search for a books table on the database, without the need for  specifying it explicitly.  If you need to bind a certain model with another table, you can specify the name  adding it as a $table property, like this:    <?php   namespace App;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Book extends Model {      protected $table = 'my_books';  }  Alright, nothing more to say here. Now, let's play with our new model.  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Create, read, update, and delete  operations basics Every single article I read about Eloquent usually starts with some reading  operations. I don't like it. I will teach you how to create and insert new records,   then we will fetch them with some reading operations.  No boring test inserts with some external administration tool.  Creating operations Let's create our first book! As a reference for the record structure, we will use the  books table that we created in the previous chapter. The table has a very simple  structure: a title, page count  pages_count , price, and description.  The procedure is as easy as creating an object.  Well, actually it is exactly the same. Create a new GET route in routes.php file   under app Http , named book_create and type this:    Route::get 'book_create', function  {      $book = new \App\Book;      $book->title = 'My First Book!';     $book->pages_count = 230;     $book->price = 10.5;     $book->description = 'A very original lorem ipsum dolor sit         amet...';    } ;  If you think about it, there is something strange here! After checking the Model file,  you can see that there are no title or pages_count properties declared. Among  other things, Eloquent heavily uses magic methods. When the final query is built  Laravel will use the names of the properties as the table columns to fill. Big deal!  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, if you run this code and then check your table, you will not find any record  yet. You must add a single final instruction: the save   method call.    Route::get 'book_create', function   {        $book = new \App\Book;        $book->title = 'My First Book!';       $book->pages_count = 230;       $book->price = 10.5;       $book->description = 'A very original lorem ipsum dolor sit         amet...';        $book->save  ;    } ;  Execute it. Now, your book is saved on the database.  If you want, you can access a specific record field even after you've saved it.   Let's make another example.    Route::get 'book_create', function   {        $book = new \App\Book;        $book->title = 'My First Book!';       $book->pages_count = 230;       $book->price = 10.5;       $book->description = 'A very original lorem ipsum dolor sit           amet...';        $book->save  ;        echo 'Book: ' . $book->id;    } ;  There is another little thing about Eloquent conventions; that is,  every single table has an ID, autoincrementing a primary key.  [ 47 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Reading operations Now that we've created some example records, why don't we try to read them?   An example is better than a thousand words.    Route::get 'book_get_all', function  {      return \App\Book::all  ;    } ;  With a single instruction, here we are returning all the table records. The output is  going to be very similar to this:    [     {       id: 1,       title: "My First Book!",       pages_count: 230,       price: "10.50",       description: "A very original lorem ipsum dolor sit           amet...",       created_at: "2015-03-24 16:45:59",       updated_at: "2015-03-24 16:45:59"     }   ]  If you feel strange about this, don't worry. If you return, in a route   or in a controller method  the results of an Eloquent model query,  the results will be automatically transformed in JSON. It is a very  useful shortcut if you are thinking about building a RESTful API.  Let's create another book, to give our tests more elements.      $book = new \App\Book;      $book->title = 'My Second Book!';     $book->pages_count = 122;     $book->price = 9.5;     $book->description = 'Another very original lorem ipsum dolor       sit amet...';      $book->save  ;  [ 48 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After this, again execute your code in the book_get_all route. The result will be   like this:    [     {       id: 1,       title: "My First Book!",       pages_count: 230,       price: "10.50",       description: "A very original lorem ipsum dolor sit         amet...",       created_at: "2015-03-24 16:45:59",       updated_at: "2015-03-24 16:45:59"     },     {       id: 2,       title: "My Second Book!",       pages_count: 122,       price: "9.50",       description: "Another very original lorem ipsum dolor sit         amet...",       created_at: "2015-03-24 16:57:15",       updated_at: "2015-03-24 16:57:15"     }   ]  However, we can do more. In fact, another great method is the find   method.   You can use it like this:    Route::get 'book_get_2', function  {        return \App\Book::find 2 ;    } ;  This method takes the primary ID as a parameter and returns the single record as   an instance of the model.  Have a look at its output:    {     id: 2,     title: "My Second Book!",     pages_count: 122,     price: "9.50",  [ 49 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       description: "Another very original lorem ipsum dolor sit       amet...",     created_at: "2015-03-24 16:57:15",     updated_at: "2015-03-24 16:57:15"   }  Note that this time you don't have an array but a single object. These static methods,  of course, aren't all Eloquent has to offer. The cool part starts here.  Take a look at this:    Route::get 'book_get_where', function  {        $result = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', ' get  ;       return $result;  You can use the where   method to filter your results. Then, after specifying your  criteria, the get   method retrieves the results from the database. For a better  understanding, imagine that the where   method is building a query. The get    method executes it. This last one is a trigger method.  If you just want to retrieve the first result instead of all of them, you can use the  first   method instead of get  .    Route::get 'book_get_where', function  {        $result = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '<',         1000 ->first  ;       return $result;    } ;    } ;  Before we go any further, here's a little reminder that can save you a  lot of time. Actually, when you use trigger methods such as get   or  first  , you can get two different kinds of results. When you use first  , you are selecting a single instance. So, you  will receive as a result  if present  a single instance of a certain model.  Otherwise, if you are using all  , or get  , you will get a collection  of instances.  [ 50 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting back to our where  , you can chain as many calls as you wish.    Route::get 'book_get_where_chained', function  {        $result = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '<', 1000                ->where 'title', '=', 'My First Book!'                ->get  ;        return $result;    } ;  You can iterate through results in a very simple way: simple for each is enough.    Route::get 'book_get_where_iterate', function  {        $results = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '<',         1000 ->get  ;        if count $results  > 0        {         foreach $results as $book {              echo 'Book: ' . $book->title . ' - Pages:               ' . $book->pages_count . '  ';          }       }       else         echo 'No Results!';        return '';   } ;  The $results object is countable, so you can also check if you have results or not.  Have a look at this line:    echo 'Book: ' . $book->title . ' - Pages: ' .     $book->pages_count . '  ';  You probably already noted that you can access a single record field in the same way  as you did for setting them: magic methods.  [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you like it, you can access record fields like an array. Try to switch $book->title to $book['title'] and see  what happens.  Updating operations Updating a record is as easy as creating it. To be honest, it is exactly the same thing  with a single change in the first instruction.    Route::get 'book_update', function   {        $book = \App\Book::find 1 ;        $book->title = 'My Updated First Book!';       $book->pages_count = 150;        $book->save  ;    } ;  Instead of creating it, we are retrieving from the database the instance of the   Model we desired. After that, using magic methods, we modified and then saved it.  As happened for the insert procedure, the change you make becomes persistent after  the save   call.  Deleting operations Deleting a record is the simplest thing.    Route::get 'book_delete_1', function   {        \App\Book::find 1 ->delete  ;    } ;  Time to die, Book!  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here's a key concept. When you use the update   and delete    methods, you are working on a Model instance, just like you did before  while creating it. So, if you run a \App\Book::find 1  instruction, you will get a  Book class instance as a result. For some, it will be obvious, but many  newcomers often have problems with this.  where, aggregates, and other utilities No doubt that the where   method will be one of your best friends while building  queries and selecting records in your work with Eloquent. Don't you think it would  be worth taking a look at it in detail?  Let's recap what we already know.  You can use the where   method to filter results. The correct syntax you have to   use is this:    where 'field_name', 'operator', 'term'   So, for example, you can filter all the books with less than 100 pages with    where 'pages_count', '<', 100   Also, you can chain more where methods, one after another, to build more complex  queries. Let's select all those books that have less than 100 pages, with a title that  starts with an M.    where 'pages_count', ' where 'title', 'LIKE', 'M%'   Two chained conditions are equivalent to condition1  AND condition2.  Great!  [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   where and orWhere However, you know that this is not enough. Usually, in a real-world application,   you may have more complex conditions. First of all, you may need to get results   that respect a condition OR another condition. The AND condition is not a standard;   so, here's the solution: orWhere  .    Route::get 'book_get_where_complex', function  {        $results = \App\Book::where 'title', 'LIKE', '%Second%'                ->orWhere 'pages_count', '>', 140                ->get  ;        return $results;    } ;  In this code, we are telling Eloquent to take all the books that have the word Second  in the title or all the books with more than 140 pages.  Yeah, this is a little better than before.  Now let's try to imagine another more complex condition: we want to find all the  books that have more than 120 pages and the word Book in the title, or all the books  that have less than 200 pages and an empty description.    Route::get 'book_get_where_more_complex', function  {        $results = \App\Book::where function $query {            $query               ->where 'pages_count', '>', 120                ->where 'title', 'LIKE', '%Book%' ;        } ->orWhere function $query {            $query               ->where 'pages_count', '<', 200                ->orWhere 'description', '=', '' ;        } ->get  ;              return $results;    } ;  [ 54 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Instead of specifying three parameters for where   and orWhere   methods,   you can use a single closure parameter that takes a $query argument. Starting   from that $query object, you will be able to do every selection and filtering in the  way you prefer.  Of course, you can nest many of them:    Route::get '...', function  {        $results = \App\Book::where function $query {            $query               ->where function $query {                     other conditions here...                  $query->where function $query {                       deeper and deeper in the seas of                     conditions...                  } ;                }                ->orWhere 'field', 'operator', 'condition' ;        } ->orWhere function $query {            $query               ->where 'field', 'operator', 'condition'                ->orWhere function $query {               other conditions here...                } ;        } ->get  ;        return $results;    } ;  Alright, stop. I think that the concept is quite clear now. Let's see some other forms of  where.  [ 55 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First of all, here's whereBetween that you can use to filter some fields using a range,  not only a single value.    $results = \App\Book::whereBetween 'pages_count',     [100, 200] ->get  ;  With that, we just got all the books that have a page count between 100 and 200.  You can also use whereIn to check if a specific field is in an array of other values.    $results = \App\Book::whereIn 'title', ['My First Book!',     'My Second Book!'] ->get  ;  Finally, you can use whereNull if you want to get all the records with a certain  column equal to null.    $booksThatDontExist = \App\Book::whereNull 'title' ->get  ;  Magic wheres Another great and cool feature is the magic where. You know that everything   in Laravel has a little bit of magic here and there. Obviously, Eloquent isn't   an exception.  In fact, you can use an alternative syntax for your where clause, a magic syntax   that lets you define the interested field as the method name.  You already know this syntax:  Route::get 'book_get_where', function  {        $result = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '=',         1000 ->first  ;       return $result;  Now, you can get the same result with this code:  Route::get 'book_get_where', function  {        $result = \App\Book::wherePagesCount 1000 ->first  ;       return $result;    } ;    } ;  [ 56 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Obviously, the wherePagesCount method doesn't exist but Laravel automatically  creates a quick where clause using PHP magic methods. As you can see from the  example  and as the syntax suggests , you cannot use this technique every time   as it works only with the equal sign.  However, it's good to know a similar shortcut, right?  Aggregates Sometimes, you will need to use the aggregates functions. No problem! Here is how  you can do it with Eloquent.    \App\Book::count  ;  This is an example of its practical use:    Route::get 'book_get_books_count', function  {        $booksCount = \App\Book::count  ;       return $booksCount;  Exactly as you saw before for get   and first   methods, you can use aggregate  methods with where methods. Here, we are counting the number of the books with  more than 140 pages.    Route::get 'book_get_books_count', function  {        $booksCount = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '>',         140 ->count  ;       return $booksCount;  Obviously, count   is not the only aggregate. Let's see them with some other  where   examples to do more practice. This time, we are searching for the   minimum number of pages  but the books with more than 120 pages, at least .    Route::get 'book_get_books_min_pages_count', function  {        $minPagesCount = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '>',         120 ->min 'pages_count' ;       return $minPagesCount;    } ;    } ;    } ;  [ 57 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You can also do the same thing with max  :    Route::get 'book_get_books_max_pages_count', function  {        $maxPagesCount = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '>',         180 ->max 'pages_count' ;       return $maxPagesCount;  Now, let's find the average price for all the books that have the Book word in   the name:    Route::get 'book_get_books_avg_price', function  {      $avgPrice = \App\Book::where 'title', 'LIKE',       '%Book%' ->avg 'price' ;       return $avgPrice;  Finally, let's get the sum of all the page counts for all the books with more   than 100 pages.    Route::get 'book_get_books_avg_price', function  {      $countTotal = \App\Book::where 'pages_count', '>',       100 ->avg 'price' ;       return $countTotal;    } ;    } ;    } ;  Utility methods As you probably imagined, Eloquent has a lot of utilities and methods that can  improve your life as a developer. Trying to cover every single method would be   hard but besides the most common methods, there are a few other methods that  deserve to be here.  First of all, the skip   and take   methods that are used to implement some  pagination in your queries.    $books = \App\Book::skip 10 ->take 10 ->get  ;  [ 58 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We are telling Eloquent to take 10 records and skip 10 from the start. So, if skip 0 - >take 10  will take records from 1 to 10, skip 10 ->take 10  will take from 11 to  20, and so on.  Of course, you can't also miss the orderBy, groupBy, and having methods. If you  know a little about SQL databases  and if you are here, I think you do  you won't  have any problem understanding this code:       orderBy   \App\Book::orderBy 'title', 'asc' ->get  ;       groupBy   \App\Book::groupBy 'price' ->get  ;       having   \App\Book::having 'count', ' get  ;  Mass assignment... for the masses You got the basics. Cool!  Now, you have to know about another couple of ways to insert a record   with Eloquent.  The first is the Model constructor. You can pass an associative array as a parameter  of the constructor call, something like this:    $book = new \App\Book [     'title' => $title,     'pages_count' => $pagesCount,     'price' => $price   ] ;  Another is the create   method that you can call statically from the model itself.    $book = \App\Book::create [     'title' => 'My First Book!',     'price' => 10.50,     'pages_count' => 150,     'description' => 'My lorem ipsum dolor description here...'   ] ;  [ 59 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Similar to the constructor, this create   method takes an associative array as a  parameter and every key in this array corresponds to a column on the table  and a  magic property on the model . The returned value  the one that is stored in $book  is  an instance of the Book class. This is called mass assignment and, until this point, everything is fine except   for a serious security issue. In fact, sometimes you could pass the entire request   input array as a parameter. Trust me: sooner or later, you will do it.  The $request object you are going to see in the following example  is a request instance that you can use to deal with the current request  data. I will use it to retrieve some hypothetical POST data from a  form  with the all   method  we will use to create a new book.  Something like this can be used:    $book = new \App\Book $request->all   ;       or...    $book = \App\Book:create $request->all   ;  Technically, you don't know exactly what's in $request->all   so it is not the best  practice, right? However, you can resolve this issue quite easily by adding a single  property to your model—fillable or guarded.  Let's take an example for a better understanding of the concept. Imagine that for  some reason you specify other fields in the form you already use for a new book  insert, maybe the current user ID for logging purposes.  However, you just want to insert four single fields: title, pages_count, price,   and description. Nothing else!  The key property is fillable:    <?php     namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {  [ 60 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         protected $fillable = [           'title',           'price',           'pages_count',           'description'       ];    }  You can execute the code like this:    $book = \App\Book:create $request->all   ;  From the moment you execute the code, the model will search for title, pages_ count, price, and description items. Nothing more! If you also have a user_id  field in your request data array, it will be ignored by the model.  Of course, be careful and check twice what you put in the $fillable array of your  models. Sometimes, developers easily forget the rights fields, and they pass hours  and hours after an empty database record.  So, if you actually get a problem with an empty database record, remember: check  your fillable.  The guarded property has a similar behavior but does the opposite thing: if  fillable is a whitelist, then guarded is a blacklist. A mechanism like a blacklist can  be extremely useful if you store some important and sensible information that you  don't want to get updated by the user in any way.  Also, sometimes you will need to guard every single attribute of your model. No  problem, use guarded like this:    <?php     namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {        protected $guarded = ['*'];    }  [ 61 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you put a field both in the fillable and guarded arrays, the  model behavior will give the precedence to fillable and the field  will be filled in. Also, use fillable and guarded wisely. Remember also, that if you  are using the guarded array and you are passing a classic full request  data array to your model, you could update some unwanted fields  and get some really unwanted errors.  Boring errors! Avoid them.  Timestamps and soft deletes Time to cover two awesome features of the Model class: timestamps and soft deletes.  How many times have you had to manually handle the creation date of a record and  its last update time? Model timestamps are here to help.  Also, how many times have you had to create a delete feature while maintaining  some information about your data, if not at all? Yeah, the soft deleting feature is   here to help too.  Timestamps Do you remember the last method we called in our books table migrations? No?  Don't worry, here it is:    Schema::create 'books', function Blueprint $table    {        other fields...        $table->timestamps  ;   } ;  Exactly, it is the timestamps   method. This special Schema Builder method is used  to create two separate fields: created_at and updated_at, both MySQL DATETIME  or equivalent. Eloquent automatically handles these two fields when you create or  update a record. It can be extremely useful: how many times did you have to deal with some last edit  data on a specific table? Also, imagine how much easier it could be with these two  fields to handle some scheduled article posting.  [ 62 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   However, sometimes they are not so useful: you can disable them just by setting the  timestamps property model  to false.    <?php    namespace App;    class Book extends Model {        public $timestamps = false;    }    <?php    namespace App;    class Book extends Model {        protected $table = 'books'';  Obviously, if you plan to disable timestamps you can delete  the corresponding timestamps   Schema Builder call in your  migration. You are not going to need it anymore.  You can eventually specify the format of your timestamps, if needed. Here's an example:        protected function getDateFormat         {              returining a different timestamp format!           return 'd m Y';       }    }  All you have to do is to implement the getDateFormat method in your model and  let it return a string that describes the desired format.  In the returned string, you can insert anything that is a valid format  for the date   PHP function  you can find a complete reference at  http:  php.net manual en function.date.php .  [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Soft deleting The soft deleting feature is a really interesting feature that can be useful on   many occasions.  If you decide to activate soft deleting, you will never really delete a record: instead,  a deleted_at column will be updated with the date of the operation, but nothing  more. Eloquent will work exactly like before but you will never lose anything.  It could be a perfect fit for an e-commerce database that handles orders. The  customer could decide to clear his order history. However, in order to keep   accounts perfect, the shop owner would continuously need every single order detail.  As you can easily imagine, from the previous chapter, in order to activate the   soft deleting feature, you will have to make a call to softDeletes   Schema   Builder method.    Schema::create 'books', function Blueprint $table    {        other fields...        $table->softDeletes  ;   } ;  After this, you will have to include the SoftDeletes trait in the model.    <?php    namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;    class Book extends Model {        use SoftDeletes;        protected $dates = ['deleted_at'];    }  Nothing more!  Also, working with soft deleted data is really easy. Let's implement a simple example  based on the situation we described before  the customer order's details   and shop owner's need .  [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First of all, here's an example model:    <?php    Order.php    namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;    class Order extends Model {        use SoftDeletes;        protected $dates = ['deleted_at'];    }  In his her order history, a customer should see only his her existent orders and not   deleted orders. I used quotation marks because we are talking about records   that always exist.       getting all the orders  $orders = \App\Order::orderBy 'created_at', 'desc' ->get  ;  Nothing really special!  What about the shop owner? The magical word is withTrashed:       getting all the orders, including the "deleted" ones...  $orders = \App\Order::withTrashed  ->orderBy 'created_at',   'desc' ->get  ;  The withTrashed method automatically includes every result that is actually   present in the table, regardless of the deleted_at field value.  Also, if you need to see only the soft deleted fields, change withTrashed to  onlyTrashed.    $trashedOrders = \App\Order::onlyTrashed  ->orderBy     'created_at', 'desc' ->get  ;  Finally, you can restore a record that has been deleted with the restore method.    $trashedOrder = \App\Order::find $trashedOrderId ;   $trashedOrder->restore  ;       $trashedOrder is not so trashed anymore...  [ 65 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you prefer, you can execute the restore operation using a query as a filter.    \App\Order::where 'customer_id', '=', $customerId ->restore  ;  Alright, I know what you are thinking: this feature is cool but what if I want to really  delete a field?  No problem; just use forceDelete.    order = \App\Order::find $orderId ;       bye bye... forever :'    $order->forceDelete  ;  Query scopes Query scopes are very funny and also powerful. I really like them because, like many  programmers out there, I am absolutely and overwhelmingly lazy. I also have a great  justification for my laziness: the Don't Repeat Yourself  DRY  principle. In a few words, they let you reuse some logic in your queries. It is useful if you have  similar queries in your application and you don't want to write them again and again  every single time.  Let's take an example.    <?php    Book.php    namespace App;    class Book extends Model {        public function scopeCheapButBig $query        {           return $query->where 'price', '<',             10 ->where 'pages_count', '>', 300 ;       }    }  What happened? I declared a scopeCheaperButBig method. The scope prefix is  used to specify that this is going to be used as a scope.  Now, how can I use a scope?  [ 66 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here it is:    <?php    $bigAndCheaperBooks = \App\Book::cheapButBig  ->get  ;  It is a cool feature. If you also think that you can split your logic in a more intelligent  way, you can do it as follows:    <?php    Book.php    namespace App;    class Book extends Model {        public function scopeCheap $query        {           return $query->where 'price', '<', 10 ;       }        public function scopeExpensive $query        {       return $query->where 'price', '>', 100 ;       }        public function scopeLong $query        {         return $query->where 'pages_count', '>', 700 ;       }        public function scopeShort $query        {       return $query->where 'pages_count', '<', 100 ;       }  Use it accordingly, reducing repeated code.    }    <?php         getting cheaper and longer books;     $cheapAndLongBooks = \App\Book::cheap  ->long  ->get  ;  [ 67 ]  www.it-ebooks.info          getting most expensive and longer books;     $expensiveAndLongBooks = \App\Book::      expensive  ->long  ->get  ;         getting cheaper and shorter books;     $cheapAndShortBooks = \App\Book::cheap  ->short  ->get  ;         getting expensive and shorter books;     $expensiveAndShortBooks = \App\Book::      expensive  ->short  ->get  ;  If you need it, you can also define dynamic scopes in order to pass parameters to  your scopes. If you like it, calling a scope inside another is not a problem.    <?php    Book.php    namespace App;    class Book extends Model {      public function scopeLong $query        {         return $query->where 'pages_count', '>', 700 ;       }        public function scopeLongAndCheaperThan $query, $amount        {           return $query->long  ->where 'price', '<', $amount ;       }    }  Attributes casting, accessors, and  mutators Eloquent has many ways to transform the model data into something more readable  or usable  and vice versa . In this chapter, we are going to analyze three of them:  attributes casting, accessors, and mutators.  [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Attributes casting The easier way to transform your model attributes while accessing them is the  attributes casting. In a few words, it lets you define what attribute you want to   cast and what is going to be the destination type. Suppose that you have another integer field in your books table: is_rare.   If the book is rare, this will be equal to 1, 0 otherwise. However, when you   work with it, the best thing would logically be as follows:    if $book->is_rare    {        do wow things here...   }   else   {        do common things here...   }  It will not be something like this:    if $book->is_rare === 1    {        ...   }  Right? Good.    <?php    Book.php    namespace App;    class Book extends Model {      protected $casts = [         'is_rare' => 'boolean',     ];    }  So, all you have to do to fix this problem is to specify, in your model, the   casts array:  From this moment, every time you call the is_rare attribute, it will be automatically  converted to the Boolean corresponding value and returned.  [ 69 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The supported types for casting are: integer, real, float, double, string, Boolean,  object, and array.  As also the documentation suggests, the array casting type is  useful when you have a JSON array stored in a specific table  column and you want to work with it quickly.  Accessors and mutators Attributes casting is very useful but has some limitations. Sometimes, starting from  a simple value stored in the database, you need to do more complex work on it.  Accessors and mutators are here to help.  To be more specific, an accessor is a method that is executed when the user reads  a specific attribute. The accessor works on the attribute stored in the database and  returns it. A mutator works in the opposite way: when you store a value, the mutator  works, does its job and then saves it in the table. Let's say they are sorts of getters  and setters.  Defining an accessor  or a mutator  is not so difficult: all you have to do is to follow a  naming convention.  Let's start with something simple. Imagine that every time that you access the price  of your book, you want to put the dollar symbol $ at the beginning of the string.    <?php    Book.php      namespace App;      class Book extends Model {        public function getPriceAttribute           {             return '$ ' . $value;         }      }  The naming convention for an accessor is simple as shown:     The method name starts with get    The middle part of the name is the attribute name, which is camel cased    The method name ends with Attribute  [ 70 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Nothing more.  Now, have a look at this:    $book = \App\Book::find 1 ;    echo $book->price;      output: $ 10.50    <?php    Book.php      namespace App;      class Book extends Model {  Every time you have the preceding code, the mutator is very similar. This time,   we want to store a lowercase version of the title.        public function setTitleAttribute $value          {             $this->attributes['title'] = strtolower $value ;         }  The convention isn't changed so much: the only difference is that the method name  now starts with set and not get. It's all about getters and setters, my friend.  Another real common use of mutators is when the application stores the user's  password. A mutator can be used to hash the chosen password and the result is   then stored.    <?php    User.php      namespace App;      class User extends Model {        public function setPasswordAttribute $value          {             $this->attributes['password'] = \Hash::make $value ;         }      }      }  [ 71 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Descending in the code In the previous text, we analyzed many aspects of the Eloquent model. If you think  about your path, in a few pages you learned everything you needed to do many  operations with your data. Also, you saw many interesting ways to add behaviors   from accessors and mutators to model observers  in order to improve your code  usability, readability, and maintainability.  In this section you are going to read, I will go through the Model class and analyze it  a little deeper than the usual. Nothing so advanced, so don't worry: I will just use the  class code to show you what you can do with your models. Take it as a list of useful tips and tricks.  A big file At the moment I am writing this chapter, the Model class under Illuminate\ Database\Eloquent counts 3361 lines of code, which is a big class with many  methods and features. However, this length is acceptable considering that we can  do the same thing in many different ways  just think about the save   method, the  ::create   method, and the possibility to specify an associative array in the model  constructor: three ways to insert a new record .  In the first part of the class you can see all the properties we saw before, set to their  default values.    protected $fillable = array  ;    protected $guarded = array '*' ;    protected $casts = array  ;    ...    ...    ...    ...  Yes, by default every attribute is guarded. A total blacklist for maximum security!  [ 72 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Quick conversion to array or JSON Do you remember at the beginning of this chapter what I told you about the  automatic conversion to JSON of your model attributes? If you take a look at the  code into the model you will see two methods: toArray and toJson. These two  methods are the ones that make the magic happen.       from the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model class     **    * Convert the model instance to an array.    *    * @return array    *    public function toArray     {     $attributes = $this->attributesToArray  ;      return array_merge $attributes, $this->relationsToArray   ;   }    ...    ...     **    * Convert the model instance to JSON.    *    * @param  int  $options    * @return string    *    public function toJson $options = 0    {     return json_encode $this->toArray  , $options ;   }  You can also see that the second method uses the first. If you don't  fear big files, I suggest you to take a deeper look at all the methods in  this class. You will see some awesome examples of code reusing and  function writing. In this chapter, we are just scratching the surface.  [ 73 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You can convert both single models and model collections to arrays or JSON:    return \App\Book::all  ->toJson  ;       or ...       or    return \App\Book::where 'title', 'LIKE',     'My%' ->get  ->toArray  ;    return \App\Book::find 1 ->toJson  ;  Obviously, for security reasons, you can choose to mark some specific fields   as hidden. They will not be shown when the record is converted to array   or JSON.    <?php    namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class User extends Model {        protected $hidden = ['password', 'credit_card_number'];  In this case, with hidden, we specified a blacklist. You can also define a whitelist  with the visible property.    <?php    namespace App;    }    }    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class User extends Model {        protected $visible = ['first_name', 'last_name'];  [ 74 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Imaginary attributes Using accessors and a specific property of the model, appends, you can create some  attributes even if they don't exist as table columns.  For example purposes, let's assume that we want to create a complete_name  attribute, made with the two attributes first_name and last_name.  First of all, let's create the appropriate accessor in the model:    <?php    namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class User extends Model {        public function getCompleteNameAttribute       {         return $this->attributes['first_name'].           ' ' . $this->attributes['last_name'];     }  Then as the last step, we can include it in the appends array property.    }    <?php    namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class User extends Model {      protected $appends = ['complete_name'];        public function getCompleteNameAttribute       {         return $this->attributes['first_name'].           ' ' . $this->attributes['last_name'];     }    }  [ 75 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Nothing else!  Now we can use our attribute like this:    echo $user->complete_name;      outputs: Francesco Malatesta  Every attribute that you create with the appends array respects the  rules you specify eventually in the visible and hidden arrays.  Route model binding Another little cool shortcut is model binding. In a few words, it lets you link a  certain route parameter to an instance of a defined model.  Let's test it: first of all, go to RouteServiceProvider in app Providers folder.   Now follow these steps:  1.  Add this line to the boot method:    public function boot Router $router    {       parent::boot $router ;        $router->model 'book', 'App\Book' ;   }  2.  Then go to your routes file and create a new route that uses this parameter:    Route::get 'books {book}', function App\Book $book    {       return $book->title;   } ;  3.  So, calling the books 1 URL will output something like this:    My First Book!  What happened? Laravel resolved and automatically instantiated in the $book  variable the desired object, using the given parameter  1  as the search term based   on the primary ID. Then, the instance was used to output the title.  [ 76 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It's a little trick but sometimes it could be useful.  You can also customize the resolution logic: here's another example using the e-mail  address instead.    Route::bind 'user', function $value    {       return User::where 'email', '=', $value ->first  ;   } ;  If the record with the specified primary ID doesn't exist, the application will return a  404 not found error. Obviously, you can change this behavior by specifying a third  parameter for the model   binding.    Route::model 'user', 'User', function     {       throw new MyCustomNotFoundHttpException;   } ;  Records chunking for memory optimization Sometimes, you will need to process thousand and thousand of records. You know  that those operations are very heavy for your RAM, but Eloquent has a useful  method to chunk query results in blocks to optimize your load.    \App\Book::chunk 200, function $books    {       foreach  $books as $book        {              heavy operations on the book here...       }   } ;  The first parameter defines the size of the block you want to use. In this case,   we will load 200 results, process them, unload them, and repeat the same thing   with the next 200.  The second parameter is a closure that defines what to do with that chunk: the books  closure parameter is the returned collection of records.  [ 77 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary Hey, we made it again! This first overview of Eloquent is completed and now you  are able to make your first experiments on your own! Well actually you are able  to do many experiments, not just the basics. We learned all about the CRUD, mass  assignment, and many other interesting things.  If you feel overwhelmed by all this information, don't worry. Take your time to do  many tests and get familiarized with all the mechanisms, including the conventions  you found on your road. We are only at the third chapter!  In the next chapter, we will go deeper in one of the most amazing aspects of  Eloquent: relations. You will experience the power of Eloquent and how it handles  every kind of relationship between models, from the one-to-one to many-to-many,   in all its beauty.  Go, go, go, hero!  [ 78 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Exploring the World of  Relationships  United  and related  we stand, divided we fall.  In a real-world context, everything is connected; for example, a car has an owner,   a book has an author  or maybe more than one , or an e-commerce order is related   to one or more products that a customer  another relation!  has ordered.  Everything, actually, is related!  There are no differences in the application development world; usually, you create  software to solve a real-world problem. The real world is made from related things,  so you will probably have to define many relationships between your entities.  However, let's be clear: I am not saying anything new. Just go to Wikipedia and  search for entity-relationship model.  Usually, in your school books, you can find three fundamental types of relationships:     One-to-one: This is used to relate a single entity with another single entity    for example, a person and an identity document      One-to-many: This is used to define a connection between an entity with   more entities of the same type  for example, all the books of the same author      Many-to-many: This is used to relate multiple entities with many other   entities  for example, a book can be a part of more than one category, and one  category can include more than one book   [ 79 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Of course, web development makes no exceptions. Eloquent makes no exceptions. Following the convention used in what you have seen until now, Eloquent has a great  way to deal with relationships, the methods used to define them for your models,  and the techniques you can adopt to work with them.  So, let's explore what we are going to do in this chapter.  First of all, we will deal with the basic relationship types we just saw. How does  Eloquent handle them? You will discover the beauty of powerful methods such   as hasMany or belongsTo. This time, there are no more snippets; we will follow   the creation of our library management tool classes, defining every entity and   every relationship.  After the basics, you will discover how to work with these relationships: how to  query and use them in a comfortable and clean way. Also, we will see how to insert  and delete related models in your database, or update the existing models.  Sometimes, working with many-to-many relationships will mean storing some data  specific to that relationship. Eloquent has a very useful property named pivot that  you can use to query the desired pivot table.  So, many things to look at this time! However, it is not over yet! Eloquent offers two  other relationships that you can use: the has many through and polymorphic many to  many relationships.  Alright, enough chit-chat! I am not going to spoil anything now. Follow the chapter,  and you will fall in love with it.  Obviously, I will show you a real-world example for every concept. Come on, hero!     The trinity: one to one, one to many, and many to many    Querying-related models    Eager loading  and the N + 1 problem     Inserting and updating related models    Accessing distant relationships    More power! Polymorphic relationships  [ 80 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The trinity – one to one, one to many,  many to many As I mentioned earlier, we will start from the basics. So, the first thing we will see is  how you can define relationships between entities in Eloquent. This is really simple,  and usually you will just have to add a single line of code for every relationship.  One to one Our library is very concerned about tracking people who borrow books. For this  reason, every new user has to give to the library some identity document data.  Now, every user has a single identity document, and every document is absolutely  unique. If you think about it, this is a perfect one-to-one relationship. When you  build your database, the most followed rule tells you that you have to add the  necessary columns in the first table. In this specific example, we would add columns  to the user table.  However, someone could say "yes, but this is a completely different entity!"  Also, we could have to store many details about the identity document of every   user: number, type, due date, city, and so on.  In this case, you would add four or five columns to an existing table.   Many people don't like this solution, so imagine that you have the User and  IdentityDocument models.  Here's our default User model:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Auth\Authenticatable;   use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;   use Illuminate\Auth\Passwords\CanResetPassword;   use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable as     AuthenticatableContract;   use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword as     CanResetPasswordContract;    class User extends Model implements AuthenticatableContract,     CanResetPasswordContract {      use Authenticatable, CanResetPassword;  [ 81 ]  www.it-ebooks.info        **      * The database table used by the model.      *      * @var string      *      protected $table = 'users';       **      * The attributes that are mass assignable.      *      * @var array      *      protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];       **      * The attributes excluded from the model's JSON form.      *      * @var array      *      protected $hidden = ['password', 'remember_token'];  The following is our IdentityDocument model:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class IdentityDocument extends Model {    }            }  Now, let's see how to define the connection between them. For one-to-one  relationships, the methods used are hasOne   and belongsTo  . The hasOne    method is used in the following way:    $this->hasOne 'App\IdentityDocument' ;  Also, the belongsTo   method is used as follows:    $this->belongsTo 'App\User' ;  [ 82 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The syntax makes sense, right? A user has a document, and a document belongs to  a certain user! I know what you are thinking: you can't just place this method call  wherever you want in the class.  In fact, you must define a method that returns that method call like this:    public function identityDocument     {     return $this->hasOne 'App\IdentityDocument' ;   }  Similarly, belongsTo   must be defined as follows:    public function user     {     return $this->belongsTo ' App\User' ;   }  So, the final model's code will be like this:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Auth\Authenticatable;   use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;   use Illuminate\Auth\Passwords\CanResetPassword;   use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable as     AuthenticatableContract;   use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\CanResetPassword as     CanResetPasswordContract;    class User extends Model implements AuthenticatableContract,     CanResetPasswordContract {      use Authenticatable, CanResetPassword;       **      * The database table used by the model.      *      * @var string      *      protected $table = 'users';       **  [ 83 ]  www.it-ebooks.info        * The attributes that are mass assignable.      *      * @var array      *      protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];       **      * The attributes excluded from the model's JSON form.      *      * @var array      *      protected $hidden = ['password', 'remember_token'];      public function identityDocument       {       return $this->hasOne ' App\IdentityDocument' ;     }    }  The code for the User class will be:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class IdentityDocument extends Model {      public function user       {       return $this->belongsTo ' App\User' ;     }    }  Et voilà!  What exactly happened? At a database level, we created an identitydocuments table with some data  columns and a user_id external key. This external key is important because it is  used automatically by Eloquent to resolve the relationship.  [ 84 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you want, you can specify a different foreign key as a second parameter in both  methods:    $this->hasOne 'App\IdentityDocument',     'another_user_external_id' ;  Otherwise, you can use this:    $this->belongsTo ' App\User', 'another_user_external_id' ;  The field we specify is the same. Of course, the hasOne method  the User model  will  see it as an external key, and the belongsTo method  the IdentityDocument model   will see it as a local one.  There's also a third parameter that you can use in both methods. In hasOne  ,   it is used to specify the local key  the default is the id field . In the belongsTo    method, it is used to define the parent key on the parent table  again, the default   is the id field .  Let's take another example with the same models. Imagine that we have our  IdentityDocuments table with a primary key named documentidentifier.   Also, we need to follow a certain standard, and we can't use user_id as the   external foreign key name. We must use documentowner_id.  No problem. First, you will define your hasOne like this:      $this->hasOne 'App\IdentityDocument', 'owner_id' ;  We don't need to define the third argument, as our users primary key is id.  Then, you define belongsTo:      $this->belongsTo 'App\IdentityDocument',       'documentidentifier', 'owner_id' ;  Now you're done! Note that this concept is applied in the same way for other  relationship methods that we will see.  One to many This time it's easier than before: every book has an author, right? Sometimes, a  book may have more than one author, but let's assume a basic case. The second  relationship type we will analyze here is one to many. Every author can have more   than one book. Let's consider the involved models: Author and Book.  [ 85 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   These are nothing more than simple Eloquent models. Now, in order to define a   one-to-many relationship, we must use the hasMany   method.  Here's the Author class:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Author extends Model {  The Book class is as follows:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {            }            }  So, the Author class will look like this:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Author extends Model {      public function books       {       return $this->hasMany 'App\Book' ;     }    }  [ 86 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You can then use the belongsTo   method, as before, to define the inverse of this  relationship:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {      public function author       {       return $this->belongsTo 'App\Author' ;     }    }  So, we are done! We used belongsTo   again as the concept of belonging is   exactly the same; no differences.  At a database structure level, I just added an external author_id key in the   books table.  So yeah, finished! I mention it in a note before, but I will repeat: remember that  you can change your foreign key just by specifying it as a second parameter in the  hasMany   and belongsTo   methods.  Many to many Let's imagine a good example for many-to-many relationships. Well, the   books categories relationship is perfect. In fact, imagine Twenty Thousand Leagues  Under the Sea, Jules Verne.  It is not only an adventure novel but also a classic. So, you will need to classify   it under two separate categories: Classics and Adventure. Our library could also  contain Journey to the Center of the Earth, another classic, but also an other adventure  novel. Same thing!  As you can see, this time a many-to-many relationship is absolutely necessary.   Let's discover how Eloquent handles many-to-many relationships and how you   can define them on models.  [ 87 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here's the code for our Book model:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {      public function author       {       return $this->belongsTo 'App\Author' ;     }    }  The code for Category model is:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Category extends Model {            }    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {      public function author       {       return $this->belongsTo 'App\Author' ;     }      public function categories       {  [ 88 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  This time, we don't have any directions or a possible inverse of a relationship.  Specifically, there are many books for many categories. So, the only method you  need to use in this case is belongsToMany  . Use the method like this:         return $this->belongsToMany 'App\Category' ;     }    }  The other method is used as follows:    <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Category extends Model {      public function books       {       return $this->belongsToMany 'App\Book' ;     }    }  Nothing else!  Let's see what we need at a database level to handle this relation. As you can easily  imagine, you will have to work with a pivot table in this case.  So, you will need to specify an appropriate extra table in your migration file, using  the up   method, as follows:    Schema::create 'book_category', function Blueprint $table    {     $this->increments 'id' ;      $this->integer 'book_id' ->unsigned  ;     $this->integer 'category_id' ->unsigned  ;      $this->text 'notes' ;      $this->timestamps  ;   } ;  You also have some conventions to follow. These are given here:     The table name is comprised of the name of the entities, which is singular,      The table will contain two columns named after the interested entities   separated by an underscore   author_id and book_id   [ 89 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When you specify a relation, remember to use return before the  appropriate method call. I know that's a little obvious, but very often  newbies forget it. It's really, really important that you follow the defined conventions.  Laravel and Eloquent can change your workflow timeline significantly,  but to get the result, you must follow conventions. The sooner you do  it, the better you will feel.  A question of inverses A little extra before we go forward. We just saw how to define a relationship and its  inverse. However, what are the consequences you would stumble upon if you don't  define an inverse? Or what if I define an inverse and not the inverse of the inverse?  Nothing special, actually!  The best rule is to define the relationship you need. Let's imagine a situation like this:  in your software, you will need to know the category of a book, but not all the books  in a certain category.  It is a strange situation, but this happens. In this case, you can just define the  categories   relationship in Book and nothing else.  Vice versa, if in your application you will just need to get a list of books from the  category and nothing else, you will define only the books   relationship in the  Category model. That's all.  Done! The three basic relationship types are covered! You don't have to do anything  more; actually, Eloquent handles everything automatically, so all you have to do is   to write your code, use models, and raise your queries.  Oh, about queries...  Querying-related models Now that you have learned how to define your relationships, I think you are ready to  learn how to query them. Let's start with a very basic example.  [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's suppose that we are searching for the document number of a specific user.   We will use the User and IdentityDocument entities we just saw. For the purpose   of this example, imagine that you have a table identitydocuments with the  following columns:     Number: This  indicates the document number    Type: This indicates the document type    due_date: This indicates the due date of the document    City: This indicates the city where the document was released  Here's the code to get the document identity number, starting from a User instance:    $user = \App\User::where 'first_name', '=',     'Francesco' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Malatesta' ->first  ;    $identityDocumentNumber = $user->identityDocument->number;  If you echo $identityDocumentNumber, you will read the desired information.   Nice, huh?  Well, this is the way Laravel and Eloquent deal with querying your relationships.  Once you have defined it, all you have to do is to access it as a simple property   or a method.  All the other queries will be executed automatically by Laravel. In fact, follow   these simple instructions:    $user = \App\User::where 'first_name', '=',     'Francesco' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Malatesta' ->first  ;    $identityDocumentNumber = $user->identityDocument->number;  You just executed these queries:       the user Francesco Malatesta as an ID = 1...   select * from users where first_name = 'Francesco' AND     last_name = 'Malatesta';    select * from identitydocuments where user_id = 1  Now put the result in to the $identityDocumentNumber. It is quite obvious for a   one-to-one relationship; however, the same applies for a one-to-many relationship.  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's consider another example right now: good old Jules will be a perfect fit.   Let's suppose that we want to get a list of every Jules Verne books we have,   and the code is as follows:    $author = \App\Author::where 'first_name', '=', 'Jules' ->where     'last_name', '=', 'Verne' ->first  ;    foreach $author->books as $book    {     echo $book->title .  ;   }       outputs:           Journey to the Center of the Earth      Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea      Around the World in Eighty Days      Michel Strogoff  As I told you before, you can have access to your relationship using  a simple attribute or a method call. What's the difference? Well, with  the method call, you can do some filtering, and everything you saw  before, in order to get the desired result. In fact, you can raise a query  on a relationship.  Imagine that we want to get all the books with a the in the title. Here's the code:    $author = \App\Author::where 'first_name', '=',     'Jules' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Verne' ->first  ;    $theBooks = $author->books  ->where 'title', 'LIKE',     '%the%' ->get  ;    foreach $theBooks as $book    {     echo $book->title .  ;   }       outputs:           Journey to the Center of the Earth      Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea      Around the World in Eighty Days  Cool, right? It's not over yet, this is just scratching the surface!  [ 92 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Accessing a pivot table Working with many-to-many relationships, is not always about just defining a  couple of external keys. You can choose to put extra data in to your pivot table in  order to store some information for a specific connection between entities.  You already know how to create a pivot table, but how to access it? It's nothing  complex: all you have to do is to use the pivot attribute of your relationship.   Let's take an example using the previous books categories relationship we created.  1.  First, you must define which attribute you want to take from the table,   modifying the belongsToMany   call in your model:   return $this->belongsToMany 'App\Category'     ->withPivot 'created_at', 'notes' ;  2.  Then your code should be as follows:    $book = App\Book::find 23 ;    foreach $book->categories as $category    {     echo 'Association Date: ' .       $category->pivot->created_at;     echo 'Association Notes: ' . $category->pivot->notes;   }   In this little example, we just have printed all the dates that we attached a specific  category to the book with id = 23. As an extra, we also printed some extra notes.  This means that on the pivot table, we have the created_at and notes fields.  As a shortcut, you can also use:    return $this->belongsToMany 'App\Category' ->withTimestamps  ;  This is used if you just want to import timestamps data from the pivot table.  Querying a relationship Eloquent allows you to query a relationship. In other words, you can get some  results based on the existence of a certain relationship. Imagine that we want to   get all the authors who have at least one book in the database.  With Eloquent, we can do something like this:    $authorsWithABook = \App\Author::has 'books' ->get  ;  [ 93 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this case, you have to use the has method, specifying the name of the desired  method for the relationship you want to check. The author will be added to  $authorsWithABook only if at least one related book is be found. If you don't like this Boolean approach, don't worry; let's see how to find every   author with at least five books in the database.    $authorsWithAtLeastFiveBooks = \App\Author::has 'books',     '>=', 5 ->get  ;  Yeah, you can specify the second and third arguments as operator and comparison  term, respectively, for this count check.  I know, I know, cool, but not enough. Alright, what about getting all the authors  with at least one book dated 1864?  Here we go, this time with the whereHas method:    $authorsWithABookFromThe1864 = \App\Author::whereHas 'books',     function $q    {       $q->where 'year', '=', 1864 ;    } ->get  ;  As you can see, you can do it in a quite elegant way. The first parameter specified is  the name of the relationship you want to query. The second argument is a closure  that takes a $q query parameter, which you can use to define conditions.  The same concept you just saw here for a one-to-many relationship is  also used for a many-to-many relationship.  Eager loading  and the N + 1 problem  Every powerful tool must be used wisely. Relationships in Eloquent are no exception  to the rule. Actually, one of the most common problems in using Eloquent is the   N + 1 problem. To explain it, I will use an example as usual.  Let's suppose that I am showing some data for the first 100 books. Starting with this  data, I also want to print the author name for every single book.  [ 94 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using what we've learned before now, here's the code:    $books = \App\Book::take 100 ->get  ;    foreach $books as $book    {     $author = $book->author;      echo $author->first_name . ' ' . $author->last_name;   }  Even if the syntax is simple, under the hood, Eloquent is performing 101 queries!   The first one is to get the list of the 100 books, then a query for every book to get   the author. This is not exactly performance friendly, right?  Don't worry, there is a solution!  Basic eager loading Eager loading solves your problem. This time using the with   method of the Book  model, like this:    $books = \App\Book::with 'author' ->take 100 ->get  ;    foreach $books as $book    {     $author = $book->author;      echo $author->first_name . ' ' . $author->last_name;   }  Now, the number of executed queries will precipitate down to two, using a   where in!    select * from books;   select * from authors where id in  1, 2, 3, ... ;  If you want, you can also include multiple relationships in your final result.   Let's also include categories data for every book!    $books = \App\Book::with 'author',     'categories' ->take 100 ->get  ;    foreach $books as $book    {  [ 95 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       $author = $book->author;      echo 'Author: ' . $author->first_name . ' ' .       $author->last_name;      echo 'Categories:';      foreach $book->categories as $category      {       echo $category->name . ', ';     }   }  As if it's not enough, you can also include data from nested relationships.  Let's imagine that you are getting a list of categories in your application. Then, you  want to include book data for every category, and for every related book you want to  include the author's data.  All you have to do is this:    $categories = \App\Categories::with 'books.author' ->get  ;    foreach $categories as $category    {     echo $category->name;      foreach $category->books as $book      {       echo 'Title: ' . $book->title;       echo 'Author: ' . $book->author->first_name .         ' ' . $book->author->last_name;     }   }  Advanced eager loading If you want better control over your eager loading, you can define some constraints  or conditions. Let's assume that you are getting a list of authors. From this list, you  want to get every published book, from the oldest to the most recent.  [ 96 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You can do it like this:    }] ->get  ;    $authors = \App\Author::with ['books' => function $query    {     $query->orderBy 'year', 'asc' ;  All you have to do is to specify the desired eager-loaded relationships as elements of  an associative array with this syntax:    ['relationship' => function $query {         conditions here, using the $query object    }]  Lazy eager loading Sometimes you will use eager loading, but not every time. Sometimes you will   need it, sometimes not.  If you want, you can manually eager load a specific relationship in the next moment.  How? It can be done with the load   method:    $books = Book::all  ;       some operations here...    $books->load 'author', 'categories' ;  The syntax is really similar to what you saw before; all you have to do is to specify  the desired relationships as arguments.  Of course, you can also define conditions with the following:    $books->load ['categories' => function $query    {       $query->orderBy 'name', 'asc' ;    }] ;  [ 97 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The same way, nothing less, nothing more!  Remember that eager loading is a great solution to many performance  issues. Especially in my initial experiments, it helped me a lot by  letting me reach a lower number of queries. Just to make an example,  on the Laravel-Italia forum, I showed a list of threads, with some  replies, information, and thread author data, with just three queries.  Inserting and updating related models Until now, you have learned how to define relationships and query them, in order  to get data from related models. However, you can also insert and update related  models in an easy way.  Let's pick a really basic example to get started: imagine that we are adding a new  book  Michael Strogoff, Jules Verne . We have to specify some details as follows:    $book = new Book;    $book->title = 'Michael Strogoff';  Then, we specify the correct author ID:    $author = Author::where 'first_name', '=',     'Jules' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Verne' ->first  ;    $book = new Book;    $book->title = 'Michael Strogoff';      other data...    $book->author_id = $author->id;       and finally...   $book->save  ;  The save   and associate   methods Let's be clear; this works really well. However, it is not the best way you can   do it. In fact, with Eloquent, you can work with related models using some other   specific methods.  [ 98 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's rewrite this example using the method save   on a relationship. Also, we will  use an associative array as a constructor argument in order to assign attributes.    $author = Author::where 'first_name', '=',     'Jules' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Verne' ->first  ;    $author->books->save new Book [     'title' => 'Michael Strogoff',        other attributes...   ]  ;  Done! It only took a couple of instructions. The save   method will automatically set  the author_id key for the book you just passed as a parameter.  However, this is not just a time-saving trick; if you read the code carefully, you will  note that we are actually creating very readable code. Instead of setting external  keys, treating the relationship in a more physical way, we are saving the book as an  element of the collection of books for a certain author. Quite different!  You can also do the same thing with arrays of objects, using the saveMany   method:    $author = Author::where 'first_name', '=',     'Jules' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Verne' ->first  ;    $author->books->saveMany [     new Book ['title' => 'Michael Strogoff'] ,     new Book ['title' => 'The Mysterious Island'] ,     new Book ['title' => 'Off on a Comet']    ] ;  As mentioned before, the saveMany method will set the external author_id key for  every Book instance passed in the array. You can also update an existing relationship,  changing its association with another model.  In this case, you must use the associate   method. Take a look at this example:    $wrongAuthor = Author::where 'first_name', '=',     'Jules' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Verne' ->first  ;    $wrongAuthor->books->save new Book [     'title' => 'The Alchemist'   ]  ;       oops! wrong author!  [ 99 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     $book = Book::where 'title', '=', 'The Alchemist' ->first  ;   $rightAuthor = Author::where 'first_name', '=',     'Paulo' ->where 'last_name', '=', 'Coelho' ->first  ;       done!   $rightAuthor->books->associate $book ;  What happened? In the first part of the example, I assigned The Alchemist to Jules  Verne. After one year of penitence in the desert, I came back to get the right author   by using the $rightAuthor variable , and then using the associate   method on  the books relationship.  The first passed parameter is the model instance you want to work with.  So, the rule is quite simple: use the save   method when inserting  a new record or the associate   method in order to update an  existing record.  Remember that The Alchemist was not written by Jules Verne but by Paulo Coelho!  What about many to many? Everything we saw is great for one-to-one or one-to-many relationships. However,  what about many-to-many relationships? The mechanism, this time, is a little bit  different; not in terms of complexity, but in terms of syntax, more than anything else.  However, let's use an example as we did before.     We have a few books: The Alchemist and Journey to the Center of the Earth.    We also have some categories: Science Fiction, Adventure, and Classic.  As I mentioned in the first part of this chapter, this is a many-to-many relationship.  What can we do to register a relationship between The Alchemist and Adventure, or  Journey to the Center of the Earth and Classic?  In order to access our data in separate pivot tables, we will need other dedicated  methods. I know that it seems stupid and boring, but use your database management  tool to see what happens in your database when you interact with your data. It's  always a good idea to familiarize with the process.  [ 100 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   However, the first method you will use is attach  :    $book = new Book  ;    $book->title = "The Alchemist";      other attributes...    $book->save  ;       after save   call, an id is created.    $category = new Category  ;    $category->name = "Adventure";    $category->save  ;       and now...    $category->books->attach $book->id ;  As you can easily see, the attach   method is another one you can call on a  relationship. Of course, only on a many-to-many one! It takes a single parameter   in this case: the primary ID of the book I want to associate with the category.  You can also add an associative array as a second parameter if you are storing some  extra data in your pivot table:    $category = Category::where 'name', '=', 'Opera' ->first  ;    $book = Book::where 'title', '=', 'Journey to the Center of     the Earth' ->first  ;    $category->books->attach      $book->id,      ['notes' => "Well, I'm not so sure about this..."]    ;  The associative array follows the attribute_name => attribute_value format,   as usual.  [ 101 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In the same way you attach, you can detach. If you want to remove a many-to-many  relationship between two model instances, use the detach   method, as follows:    $category = Category::where 'name', '=', 'Opera' ->first  ;    $book = Book::where 'title', '=', 'Journey to the Center of     the Earth' ->first  ;       oh, come on...   $category->books->detach $book->id ;  So, you are done!  Also, both attach   and detach   methods support an array as a parameter   instead of a simple integer.    $category->books->attach      [4, 8, 15, 17, 22, 42]    ;    $category->books->detach [17, 22] ;    $category->books->attach [16, 23 => ['notes' =>     'be careful next time...']] ;  The sync   method This is a really cool way to deal with many-to-many relationships.   However, attaching and detaching things could be a little boring sometimes.   Let's try the sync   method:    $category->books->sync      [4, 8, 15, 17, 22, 42]    ;    $category->books->sync      [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]    ;  [ 102 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Confused? Let me explain everything. The sync method automatically   synchronizes relationship data, taking an array of IDs. Element after element,   it checks if the relationship was previously created or not, and sets  or unsets    them when necessary. Let's imagine that the pivot  table book_category is empty;  here's the first instruction:  This instruction will create a connection between the chosen category and the books  with the IDs 4, 8, 15, 17, 22, and 42. However, here's the second method call:    $category->books->sync      [4, 8, 15, 17, 22, 42]    ;    $category->books->sync      [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]    ;  It checks everything, and calculates a positive difference and a negative one. Books  17 and 22 are no longer in the array. The relationship will be automatically detached.  Instead, books 16 and 23 will be added with attach, another really cool utility method  that saves you a lot of time!  You can obviously add data to the pivot table with the same method used earlier:    $category->books->sync      [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 => ['notes' =>       'We either live together.... or die alone.']]    ;  Accessing distant relationships Another really interesting Eloquent feature is the possibility to define    and then access  a distant relation, using the hasManyThrough   method.  What? I see you are a little confused. No problem: let's take another example,   which is a little different from our actual context.  Imagine that you are writing an application for some kind of research management  for a research team. In this software, every user will be able to create a new research  entity, and then add some sections to that research something like this:     A User entity that has a one-to-many relationship with a Research entity    The Research entity has a one-to-many relationship with a Section entity  [ 103 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Good. First of all, for models, you could write something like this:       file: app User.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class User extends Model {      public function researches       {       return $this->hasMany 'App\Research' ;     }    }       file: app Research.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Research extends Model {      public function user       {       return $this->belongsTo 'App\User' ;     }      public function sections       {       return $this->hasMany 'App\Section' ;     }    }       file: app Section.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Section extends Model {      public function research       {  [ 104 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         return $this->belongsTo 'App\Research' ;     }    }  As a basic setup, it could work. Now, what if we want access to every section added  by a certain user? Probably, you would use something like this:       getting $author with id = 1...   $author = Author::find 1 ;       getting all $author researches...   $researches = $author->researches;    $allSections = [];       iterating to get all sections   foreach $researches as $research    {     $allSections[] = $research->sections;   }  The $allSections array would contain every section added by the user. With  Eloquent, if you want, you can create a shortcut using the hasManyThrough    method I mentioned earlier.  All you have to do is to put it in the User model as follows:       file: app User.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class User extends Model {      public function researches       {       return $this->hasMany 'App\Research' ;     }      public function sections       {       return $this->hasManyThrough 'App\Section', 'App\Research' ;     }    }  [ 105 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you want, you can specify external keys  for the current and middle entities  as the  third and fourth parameters:    return $this->hasManyThrough 'App\Section',     'App\Research', 'user_id', 'research_id' ;  In some such specific cases, it is a very useful shortcut. Enjoy it!  More power – polymorphic relationships Probably, you are thinking that Eloquent is cool and very powerful.  Well, yes, it is. However, sometimes, hasMany   or belongsToMany   isn't enough.  In some situations during your development flow, you will have to deal with more  complex relationships that could involve more than two entities.  So, as a last part of this chapter, I will talk about polymorphic relationships.   As usual, even if they aren't complex to learn, I will cover them with many   detailed examples, in order to let you fully understand the entire concept.  Let's start from the simple polymorphic relationship.  A simple polymorphic relationship A simple polymorphic relationship can be used when you have an entity that can  belong to either one entity or to another.  So, here's our first example. Imagine that you are creating an e-commerce  application. You will be able to upload some photos: either for a product,   a category, or a blog post.  This means that we will have, first of all, four separate entities:     Photo    Product    Category    Post  Now, let's prepare some code skeletons as follows:       file: app Photo.php   <?php namespace App;  [ 106 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Photo extends Model {            }            }            }            }       file: app Product.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Product extends Model {       file: app Category.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Category extends Model {       file: app Post.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Post extends Model {  [ 107 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, you can define this polymorphic relationship using the morphTo   and  morphMany   methods.     The morphTo   method is used by the class that is related to all the    other classes.     The morphMany   method is called by the owner classes.  So, let's edit our models like this:       file: app Photo.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Photo extends Model {      public function imageable       {       return $this->morphTo  ;     }    }    }       file: app Product.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Product extends Model {      public function photos       {       return $this->morphMany 'Photo', 'imageable' ;     }       file: app Category.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  [ 108 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     class Category extends Model {      public function photos       {       return $this->morphMany 'Photo', 'imageable' ;     }       file: app Post.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Post extends Model {      public function photos       {       return $this->morphMany 'Photo', 'imageable' ;     }    }    }  Done! Wait, wait. What's that imageable that is used both as a name for the method  and as a string parameter? It is a name you can choose for yourself: however, take a  look at the table structure I have used, to understand.    products       id - integer       name - string    categories       id - integer       name - string    posts       id - integer       name - string    photos       id - integer       path - string       imageable_id - integer       imageable_type - string  [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The photos table has two special fields: imageable_id and imageable_type.   A simple external key, the only difference is that, for the elements in this photos   table, you can count owners of different types. So, in imageable_id, you will put the owner ID and in imageable_type, the owner  class name!  If a photo belongs to a product, you will see Product in the imageable_type  column, then Category if the photo belongs to a category, and so on.  Obviously, working with this relationship is very simple. Here's an example:       getting a sample product...   $product = App\Product::find 3 ;    foreach $product->photos as $photo    {        working with photos here...   }  This applies for every other entity!       getting a sample category   $category = App\Category::find 42 ;    foreach $category->photos as $photo    {        working with category photos here...   }  Finally, you can also reverse things. If you have a photo and want to know who the  owner is, all you have to do is:    $photo = App\Photo::find 23 ;       getting the owner...   var_dump $photo->imageable ;  No matter what the owner's class is, Eloquent will automatically resolve the instance  and return it to you. If the owner is a blog post, you'll get the blog post. Easy!  [ 110 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A many-to-many polymorphic relationship If a simple polymorphic relationship can be defined as a special one to many,   the many-to-many relationship finds equivalence in many-to-many polymorphic  relationships.  As you saw in the earlier text, it works exactly like a many-to-many relationship.   The only difference is that you can connect a certain entity with more entities. For our example, this time, let's return to our library management system.   At the beginning of this chapter, you saw three main entities:     Author    Book    Category  Between books and categories, there is a many-to-many relationship. A book can  belong to more than one category. Similarly, a category can include more than one  book. Now, imagine that you want to extend this concept to authors.  Let's pick good old Jules as a perfect example. He wrote adventure books,   so he could be easily classified as an adventure author.  The many-to-many polymorphic relationship is the best way to deal   with the situation. This time, you will have to use the morphMany   and  morphedByMany   methods:       file: app Author.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Author extends Model {      public function categories       {       return $this->morphToMany 'App\Category', 'categorizable' ;     }    }       file: app Book.php   <?php namespace App;  [ 111 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Book extends Model {      public function categories       {       return $this->morphToMany 'App\Category', 'categorizable' ;     }    }       file: app Category.php   <?php namespace App;    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;    class Category extends Model {      public function authors       {       return $this->morphedByMany 'App\Author', 'categorizable' ;     }      public function books       {       return $this->morphedByMany 'App\Book', 'categorizable' ;     }    }  Of course, as for every many-to-many relationship, you will need a pivot table   with a structure similar to the following:    categorizables       tag_id - integer       categorizable_id - integer       categorizable_type – string  [ 112 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Pay maximum attention to names and conventions, as usual. The second   parameter of categorizable for the morphToMany   and morphedByMany    methods is the same as you specify in the pivot table, for categorizable_id   and categorizable_type.  Also, the table name used is the plural for the term   categorizable and categorizables .  After this setup, you are able to use the relationship in your code, as follows:       getting a sample author   $author = App\Author::find 30 ;       accessing categories...   var_dump $author->categories ;       getting a sample book   $book = App\Book::find 60 ;       accessing categories... in the same way!   var_dump $book->categories ;  While creating tables, you will need to add the specific _id and _type columns,   such as categorizable_id and categorizable_type.  In the Schema Builder, you can use the $table- >morphs 'categorizable' , if you want. It will  automatically add the columns you need, just specify   the -able name you desire.  Summary Alright, I think that's enough. Well, actually that's all; time to rest!  You have learned everything related to relationships in Eloquent, and now you  can even build complex applications in no time. You know everything related to  Eloquent basics, so my suggestion is: take your time to recap everything, do some  tests, write good code, and enjoy models and relationships.  When ready, turn the page and dive into something more advanced!  [ 113 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Using Collections to   Enhance Results  Until now, I told you everything about models and how to create relationships  between them. I explained you how to query your data and relationships and   even to specify complex conditions and constraints. However, I have never told   you anything about what Eloquent's outputs are. Yes, sometimes, I mentioned an   array or just the word results. Don't worry; it wasn't wrong, but there is something  more under the hood.  Well, in this chapter, I will discuss collections. When retrieving your results from a  query  using, for instance, get   or all   , you are getting a collection. That's the  right term to use.  Basically, you can think of a collection as an array of results but with some extra   utility methods. In fact, when you use a collection, you are using an instance of   the Collection class under Illuminate\Database\Eloquent.  This class implements the AggregateIterator interface that lets you treat a  collection like an array. You can use collections to perform many operations,  sometimes complex operations as well. First of all, you will see how to perform   some basic research operations and checks with collections.  Then, we will see some results transformation methods. Do you remember, in  Chapter 3, The Most Important Element – the Model!, I had told you about the automatic  transformation in JSON of a model result? Great! It's one of these methods.  [ 115 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Straight after, we will go a little deeper; after all, a collection is made up of elements.  We will work with these elements. With a collection, obviously, you can iterate  through its elements. There are some dedicated methods for iterations. Also, you  will learn how to filter a collection in an easy way, just as many things in Eloquent  are easy. Finally, we will talk about sorting operations on collections and how to  deal with them. So, nothing of this really is essential, but it will help you to better  understand how Eloquent works in every single way.  Are you ready? Here are the topics to cover:     Basic collection operations    Transforming collections       Sorting  Iterating and filtering  Basic collection operations Let's start with some really basic methods. For a better understanding of what you  are going to do, I strongly suggest that you try on your project every single method from  the following list:     The first is contains  . It returns true or false if a record with a certain ID is   included in the collection. Here's an example:   $books = \App\Book::all  ;    if $books->contains 3     {     return 'yeah, book 3 is here!';   }  All you have to do, here, is to specify the ID as a parameter.     As I told you earlier, you can use a collection as an array. So, if you want to   get the third element in a collection, you can use this:   $book = $books[2];     However, if you don't like this syntax for some reason, you can use get   in   an alternative way, like this:   $book = $books->get 2 ;  [ 116 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      With this powered syntax, you can also specify a default value if the desired   index doesn't exist:   $book = $books->get 2, "Not Found!" ;     Obviously, you can check the existence of a specific element, if you want,   with has  :   if $books->has 3     {     $book = $books->get 3 ;   }     As the opposite of get  , you can add an element with a specific index    using put  :   $book = new Book;      other attributes assignment here...    $books->put 2, $book ;  As you may imagine, the first argument is the desired index, and the second  argument is the value.     Another cool method is prepend  , which you can use to prepend an   element to a certain collection. Here's the syntax:   $firstBook = new Book;      other attributes assignment here...    $books->prepend $book ;      If you want to get an array with all the primary keys, you can use a   dedicated modelKeys   method!   $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $primaryKeys = $books->modelKeys  ;  It's not over yet; actually, there are many methods you can use for many  different things.     An example is random  , which extracts a single random item from the   specified collection:   $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $randomBook = $books->random  ;  [ 117 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Also, you can use keys   or values   to get arrays for only keys or values,      What? You want to treat your collection as a stack? No problem, pop   and   respectively.   $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $keysArray = $books->keys  ;   $valuesArray = $books->values  ;  push   are here to help!      let's get the last item!   $books = \App\Books::all  ;   $lastBook = $books->pop  ;       lets' add a new item ad the end!   $book = new Book;      other attributes assignment here...    $books->push $book ;     Now, what about searching for an item in a collection using syntax similar to   the here   you called on models? Take a look at this:     $books = \App\Book::all  ;          $book = $books->where 'title', 'Michael Strogoff' ;  Note that this method returns another category. This means that you can   use many chained calls of where  . Here's another example that gives a  better idea:    $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $book = $categories->where 'year',     1876 ->where 'page_count', 254 ;     Let's close this first part of our chapter with perPage, which is a really  intuitive method that gets a certain number of items, and all you have   to do is to specify the page and number of items you want per page.  The syntax is something like this:   $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $secondPageBooks = $books->perPage 2, 10 ;  [ 118 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   With this simple call, you are getting 10 books, starting from the second page.  I think this is a great example of expressive syntax of methods that Eloquent   and Laravel  offers.  If you want to know more about the Collection class and  what it offers, take a look at http:  laravel.com api 5.0  Illuminate Database Eloquent Collection.html or  look directly at the code in Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ Collection and Illuminate\Support\Collection classes.  Transforming collections Quite often, Eloquent automatically takes a collection to transform it into something  that you can output in a better way. For example, here is the code that I am using to  show a list of a magazine website's news categories:    $categories = \App\Category::all  ;    return $categories;  This is the corresponding output:    [     {       id: 1,       name: "Editorial",       slug: "editorial",       description: "Qui est quo asperiores aliquid vitae possimus.         Dolor consequuntur similique voluptatem a laborum dolorem         ea repellendus. Aspernatur ducimus quis dolorum consequatur         vel nam at. Aut omnis rem laborum.",       created_at: "2015-04-21 10:14:37",       updated_at: "2015-04-21 10:14:37"     },     {       id: 2,       name: "Interview",       slug: "interview",       description: "Rerum deleniti rerum aliquid laudantium id         non voluptatum. Aut quia distinctio consequatur velit natus         inventore sunt iusto. Non totam quis quam sint et.",  [ 119 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         created_at: "2015-04-21 10:14:37",       updated_at: "2015-04-21 10:14:37"     },     {       id: 3,       name: "Reportage",       slug: "reportage",       description: "Adipisci et veritatis excepturi ullam         explicabo.

Dolor consequuntur similique voluptatem a             laborum dolorem ea repellendus. Aspernatur ducimus             quis dolorum consequatur vel nam at. Aut omnis rem             laborum."  [ 120 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             "created_at" => "2015-04-21 10:14:37"           "updated_at" => "2015-04-21 10:14:37"         ]         original: array:6 [           "id" => 1           "name" => "News"           "slug" => "news"           "description" => "Qui est quo asperiores aliquid vitae             possimus. Dolor consequuntur similique voluptatem a             laborum dolorem ea repellendus. Aspernatur ducimus quis             dolorum consequatur vel nam at. Aut omnis rem laborum."           "created_at" => "2015-04-21 10:14:37"           "updated_at" => "2015-04-21 10:14:37"         ]         relations: []         hidden: []         visible: []         appends: []         fillable: []         guarded: array:1 [           0 => "*"         ]         dates: []         casts: []         touches: []         observables: []         with: []         morphClass: null         +exists: true       }       1 => Category {156 ...}       2 => Category {157 ...}     ]   }  Wait, wait; what? Just changing a dd   call with a return? Well, you can see this  magic using two special methods: toArray and toJSON. You can also use them  manually, if you need, just like this:    $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $toArray = $books->toArray  ;   $toJson = $books->toJson  ;  Cool, right?  [ 121 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The dd   function I used before is a Laravel utility. It's a mix of the  native PHP var_dump   and die  . To be more precise, it shows the  value of a certain object or variable, and then stops the script.  Iterating and filtering Sometimes you will need something more than passing a collection in to a view, or a  simple toArray   call. An Eloquent collection has many methods that you can use to  filter and iterate through its elements. Let's see something in action!  Iterating First of all, let's begin with simple iteration. You can call the each   method to iterate  the elements of a certain collection:    $books = \App\Book::all  ;    $books->each function $book    {     echo $book->title;   } ;  All you have to do is to pass as the first  and only  argument a closure with a single  parameter: the single item to be used. In this example, I just printed all the titles.  Filtering If you want to filter your collection in a more complex way, you can use filter  .  Let's take an example: I want to select every book that was printed after 1840.    $books = \App\Book:all  ;    $books->filter function $book    {     if $book->year > 1840        return true;     else       return false;   } ;  [ 122 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The syntax is really similar to the previous example. You have a closure as a  parameter, with a single argument passed; that is, the collection item.  However, this time you will have to check your conditions and return true or   false if you want to include  or not  this item in the result collection.  So, in this specific case, the current $book value was printed after 1840? Great, come  in. Not printed after 1840? Bye bye!  Sorting Finally, you can sort data using a certain field. The methods you must use, this   time, are sortBy and sortByDesc. I think you are quite smart enough to understand  what they do, right?  However, here are some examples:       ordering books by title, ascending   $books = $books->sortBy function $book    {       return $book->title;   } ;       ordering books by creation date, descending;   $books = $books->sortByDesc function $book    {       return $book->created_at;   } ;  Also, you can use a shortcut if your closure logic is really simple, such as the   earlier examples:    $books = $books->sortBy 'title' ;   $books = $books->sortByDesc 'created_at' ;  Summary Let's be clear; in my opinion, knowing every single method of a collection isn't really  indispensable. However, it can be really useful in some situations where you need a  certain method to do something very specific. How can I say it? The more things you  know, the better you are!  Now, let's move on! After this little break, it's time to go down in to the world   of events!  [ 123 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Everything under Control with  Events and Observers  Have you ever heard anything about the single responsibility principle? I hope so.   It is one of the SOLID principles in programming, and it basically says that a class  has one and only one responsibility. In other words, every class has to do one single  thing and not anything else.  Usually, when you build the first version of software, everything goes fine.   Then, it happens. Your boss calls: time to introduce a new feature, developer!  Especially if update means insert this little extra behavior here, your code base easily  becomes heavy and sloppy.  Terribly sloppy! Then, you fight against deadlines, tests, Q&A, and so on, literally   an odyssey. Not a very good practice, right?  Now, in the software development world, you can find many techniques and  methods to add new features to your software in an elegant way. You have   probably heard about events in programming. In a few words, let's say it consists of logic such as this: when X does this, then Y   must do that.  Imagine a similar situation in your application: you just finished your application  and then you say, "Oh, I just forgot to send an e-mail to the newbie user!"  With Eloquent, you can handle this situation in two ways. The first way is using  the very interesting concept of model events. The second way is based on a more  advanced concept: model observers.  [ 125 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this chapter, in the first place, you will learn everything about events in the  context of Eloquent models. Then, I will cover model events: what they are and   when you would use them.  Then, I will do the same for model observers. You will learn all the differences, and  the pros and cons. Obviously, for both of the concepts, I will use a practical example  to show how to use them in a real-world situation.  Are you ready, hero?     When should I use events in my models?    Model events    An example of model events    Model observers    An example of model observers  When should I use events in my models? What is an event? If you search the term on Google, you will get multiple results. For example, it will be defined as something that happens or is regarded as happening; an  occurrence, especially one of some importance. It may also be defined as something that  occurs in a certain place during a particular interval of time.  I like these two definitions because they fit perfectly in this context. In fact, you can  see the particular interval of time as the model lifecycle, in a certain sense.  You can create a new instance, update an existing instance, or delete it.  Every operation you can do is related to two events.  Starting from the basics: I have just created that record, I deleted that record, or I am  updating that record, sounds natural, right?  Good. Now, Eloquent triggers some events when something happens in the model  lifecycle. To be more precise, they are as follows:  creating created updating updated saving  saved deleting deleted restoring restored  [ 126 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   For every operation, you have two separate events. As you may imagine, they refer  to separate moments. Let's pick the create operation for our example. You have the creating event, that you can read as "the create operation is going to  happen." Then, you have created that means "the create operation just happened".  As a scientist would say:  Operation creating created  Description is about the t - 1 moment is related to the t + 1 moment  So, you have two events for the three basic operations: create, update, and delete.  Also, you can see two more operations: save and restore. However, don't worry,   they are not complex, in fact:     Save: All you have to know is that the save operation is related both to    create and update. Let's assume that you want to add a behavior, whether or  not the application is creating a record or saving an existing record. Why  bother declaring the same thing twice? Just use the "save" generic operation  and you're done.     Restore: The restore operation is used when you have the soft deletes    feature enabled for a certain model, and you undo a delete operation on it.  Ok, I know what you are thinking: what about going deeper into the concepts?  Model events The first technique we are going to look at for events is called model events.   The basic concept is really simple:          In the EventServiceProvider class, you can add a special event listener   and bind it to a certain closure In this closure, you will be able to specify your new behavior without  touching the model code     This binding must be placed in the boot   method of the class  Here's a simple example of a binding between the created user event and a closure,  passed as a parameter of the called method.  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The $user parameter of the closure contains the instance of the concerned user:    public function boot DispatcherContract $events    {       parent::boot $events ;        User::created function $user        {              doing something here, after User creation...       } ;   }  As you can imagine, every model has these methods, named after the events we saw  before. So, if you want to bind a certain operation to a saved event, for instance, you  must use the following:    User::saved function $user      {            doing something here, after User save operation              both create and update ...     } ;  Another interesting feature is the possibility to stop the current operation with the  pre methods. In fact, if you are using any of the following:     creating    updating    saving    restoring    deleting  You can decide to return the Boolean value false if you want to abort the operation.  Let's say you want to abort the create operation if the user e-mail ends with the   @deniedprovider.com string. You could do something like this:    User::creating function $user      {       if ends_with $user->email, '@deniedprovider.com'         {         return false;       }     } ;  Obviously, you can't do the same on the created, updated, saved, restored, and  deleted events; the event just happened and you can't go back in time!  [ 128 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An example of model events We can now look at some examples of model events in action.  Let's start with the great classic. A new user joins us, and we want to greet them with  a welcome e-mail. Nothing is easier! Let's open EventServiceProvider and add this  code just after the parent::boot   call:    User::created function $user {      Mail::send 'emails.welcome', ['user' => $user],       function $message  use  $user      {         $message->to $user->email, $user->first_name . ' ' .           $user->last_name ->subject 'Welcome to My Awesome App,           '.$user->first_name.'!' ;     } ;    } ;  Done! Wasn't it easy?  I am assuming that you have a welcome.blade.php view  in the emails folder under resources views. I am also  assuming that you know the basics of e-mail sending in  Laravel. If you need some more info, go to http:  laravel. com docs 5.0 mailbasic-usage.  Here is another example of model events in action:  Let's assume that we have a class  for the purpose of this example  that is delegated   to send an e-mail to every user who wants to know when a new book by a   certain author is added. The class is named NewBookNotifier, and the method  is called forAuthor $authorId , where the $authorId is the primary key of the  desired author.  We could do something like this:    Book::created function $book {      $newBookNotifier = new NewBookNotifier  ;     $newBookNotifier->forAuthor $book->author->id ;    } ;  [ 129 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Done! The main point is that this is very simple. As I mentioned earlier, the most  important part is that every model remains untouched. You can even add a very  complex behavior, but you will not touch anything in the model. This is a great  advantage because if you test that model and you don't touch it, you can be sure   that it will never break. Now, I am going to talk about more complex things.  Events observers Model events are cool, I agree. However, sometimes, you could need something  more advanced.  When you use Laravel, you are working mostly with object-oriented programming  and probably want to do the same with your model events. The answer to your  questions is model observers, which is an advanced version of model events.  To use them, all you have to do is to declare a new class like the following    maybe in a dedicated folder called observers :    class BookObserver {      public function creating $book      {          I want to create the $book book, but first...     }        public function saving $book        {              I want to save the $book book, but first...       }        public function saved $book        {              I just saved the $book book, so....       }    }   Then register it with:    Book::observe new BookObserver ;  In the boot   method of the EventServiceProvider class.  [ 130 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There is nothing more to it, the concept is exactly the same. With observers you can  also use every single notion you learned before with model events. You can declare  every method you want, and to bind a specific event, just use the event identifier for  the method name. So, the creating event will be related to the creating   method   and so on. Obviously, you can also abort an operation if you are using the pre methods,   such as creating or updating:    class BookObserver {      public function creating $book      {       $somethingGoesWrong = true;        if $somethingGoesWrong        {         return false;       }     }    }  Alright, now let's look at a couple of examples using model observers!  An example of model observers First of all, here's how you can do the same thing you did in the first model events  example, using observers.  Create a new file named WelcomeUserObserver.php under app Observers.   Now, type in the following:    <?php    namespace App\Observers;    class WelcomeUserObserver {      public function created $user {        Mail::send 'emails.welcome', ['user' => $user],         function $message  use  $user   [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         {           $message->to $user->email, $user->first_name . ' ' .             $user->last_name ->subject 'Welcome to My Awesome App,             '.$user->first_name.'!' ;       } ;      }    }  Then, you can register the observer in the boot   method of  EventServiceProvider:     **    * Register any other events for your application.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Contracts\Events\Dispatcher  $events    * @return void    *    public function boot DispatcherContract $events    {       parent::boot $events ;        User::observe new WelcomeUserObserver ;   }  Ta-dah! You're done. Your observer is now attached to your model.  Let's imagine another situation now. After a meeting with developers, it comes   out that the librarian needs some small introduced in to the code base:     A notification for every user when a new author is added to the system    An e-mail sent every time an author is added or deleted  Finally, every time a book is deleted, the librarian must know how many authors   are stored in the database without a related book. Good. Let's start. We will build three separate classes: remember the Single  Responsibility Principle, my friend.  We will have:     CustomerNewAuthorObserver    LibrarianAuthorObserver    AuthorsWithoutBooksObservers  [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You can name your classes as you prefer. I used this convention just  as an example to easily link the behavior to the chosen name.  Then, let's create the three separate classes:    <?php       file: app Observers CustomerNewAuthorObserver    namespace App\Observers;    class CustomerNewAuthorObserver {      public function created $author      {      }    }    <?php      }      }    }    <?php       file: app Observers LibrarianAuthorObserver    namespace App\Observers;    class LibrarianAuthorObserver {      public function created $author      {      public function deleted $author      {  [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info        file: app Observers AuthorsWithoutBooksObservers    namespace App\Observers;    class AuthorsWithoutBooksObservers {      public function deleted $author      {      }    }    <?php  Good. Now, it's time to add some logic.  First of all, let's add CustomerNewAuthorObserver:       file: app Observers CustomerNewAuthorObserver    namespace App\Observers;    class CustomerNewAuthorObserver {      public function created $author      {          getting all users...       $users = \App\User::all  ;        foreach $users as $user        {         Mail::send 'emails.created_author_customer',           ['author' => $author], function $message  use  $user          {             $message->to $user->email, $user->first_name . ' ' .               $user->last_name ->subject 'New Author Added!' ;         } ;       }     }    }  [ 134 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A very rude approach, I know. As usual, it's just for teaching  purposes. Don't try this at home!  Then, our LibrarianAuthorObserver class is as follows:    <?php       file: app Observers LibrarianAuthorObserver    namespace App\Observers;    class LibrarianAuthorObserver {      public function created $author  {       Mail::send 'emails.created_author_librarian',         ['author' => $author], function $message  use  $author        {           $message->to 'librarian@awesomelibrary.com',             'The Librarian' ->subject 'New Author: ' .             $author->first_name . ' ' . $author->last_name ;       } ;     }      public function deleted $author  {       Mail::send 'emails.deleted_author_librarian',         ['author' => $author], function $message  use  $author        {           $message->to 'librarian@awesomelibrary.com',             'The Librarian' ->subject 'New Author: ' .             $author->first_name . ' ' . $author->last_name ;       } ;     }  Finally, we have the following:    }    <?php       file: app Observers AuthorsWithoutBooksObservers    namespace App\Observers;  [ 135 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     class AuthorsWithoutBooksObservers {      public function deleted $author  {       $authorsWithoutBooks = \App\Author::has 'books',         '=', 0 ->get  ;        if count $authorsWithoutBooks  > 0 {         Mail::send 'emails.author_without_books_librarian',           ['authorsWithoutBooks' => $authorsWithoutBooks],           function $message          {             $message->to 'librarian@awesomelibrary.com',               'The Librarian' ->subject 'Authors without Books!               A check is required!' ;         } ;       }     }    }  As mentioned earlier, I am assuming that you have all the needed  views and know how to deal with e-mails. If not, take a look at the  http:  laravel.com docs 5.0 mailbasic-usage page.  It doesn't end here. You can use observers and events for a vast number of cases and  scenarios. Just to take an example, imagine that you are writing a blog and you want  to regenerate your sitemap every time you create or edit an article. Observers are the  answer, or maybe you want to log something while you add new books—use event  observers, again!  [ 136 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary Great! You are now able to deal with events in every form, starting from the   very basic to the more advanced concepts of observers. You just added another   little piece to your Eloquent knowledge: the further you go, the more you will learn  about how to make sophisticated applications. Also, we're respecting some of the  SOLID principles!  Not bad, huh? However, don't use observers and events for everything.   Sometimes, they are not the best choice, and you have to use other tools. So, be  careful and analyze the individual problem you want to solve. A good technique  never applies well to everything. Well, time to take another step forward. If you want, take some rest; the intermediate  part of our work is done. In the next two chapters, in fact, you will learn some  advanced things.  Are you ready? Great!  Turn the page and learn how to use Eloquent without Laravel!  [ 137 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Eloquent… without Laravel!  Our journey is close to the end, hero. You learned everything about Eloquent,  starting from the very basics and going through models, relationships, and other  topics. You probably started to like it and think about implementing it in your   next project.  In fact, creating an application without a single SQL query is tempting. Maybe   you also showed it to your boss and convinced him her to use it in your next  production project.  I am so proud of you, hero!  However, there is a little problem. Yeah, the next project isn't so new. It already  exists, and, despite everything, it doesn't use Laravel! You start to shiver. This is so  sad because you passed the last week studying this new ORM, a really cool one,   and then moving forward.  Ok, stop complaining! There is always a solution! You are a developer! Also,   the solution is not so hard to find. If you want, you can use Eloquent without  Laravel. Yes, seriously! Actually, Laravel is not a monolithic framework. It is made up of several, separate  parts, which are combined together to build something greater. However, nothing  prevents you from using only selected packages in another application.  A really cool idea!  So, what are we going to see in this chapter?  First of all, we will explore the structure of the database package and see what is  inside it. Then, you will learn how to install the illuminate database package  separately for your project and how to configure it for the first use.  [ 139 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Then, you will encounter some examples. First of all, we will look at the Eloquent  ORM. You will learn how to define models and use them. Having done this, as a little extra, I will show you how to use the Query Builder   remember that the "illuminate database" package isn't just Eloquent . Maybe  you would also enjoy the Schema Builder class. I will cover it, don't worry!  À la charge!  We will cover the following:  Installing and configuring the database package     Exploring the directory structure       Using the ORM    Using the Query and Schema Builders    Summary  Exploring the directory structure As I mentioned before, the key step in order to use Eloquent in your application  without Laravel is to use the "illuminate database" package.   So, before we install it, let's examine it a little.   You can see the package contents here: https:  github.com illuminate  database.  So, this is what you will probably see:  Folder Capsule  Connectors  Console  Eloquent  Description The capsule manager is a fundamental component.   It instantiates the service container and loads some  dependencies. The database package can communicate with various DB  systems. For instance, SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. Every  type of database has its own connector. This is the folder in  which you will find them. The database package isn't just Eloquent with a bunch of  connectors. In this specific folder, you will find everything  related to console commands, such as artisan db:seed or  artisan migrate. Every single Eloquent class is placed here.  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Folder Migrations  Query Schema  Description Don't confuse this with the Console folder. Every class  related to migrations is stored here. When you type artisan  migrate in your terminal, you are calling a class that is  placed here. The Query Builder is placed here. Everything related to the Schema Builder is placed here.  In the main folder, you will also find some other files. However, don't worry as you  don't need to know what they are.  If you open the composer.json file, take a look at the following "require" section:  "require": {   "php": ">=5.4.0",   "illuminate container": "5.1.*",   "illuminate contracts": "5.1.*",   "illuminate support": "5.1.*",   "nesbot carbon": "~1.0" },  As you can see, the database package has some prerequisites that you can't avoid.  However, the container is quite small, and it is the same for contracts  just some  interfaces  and "illuminate support".  Eloquent uses Carbon  https:  github.com briannesbitt  Carbon  to deal with dates in a smarter way. So, if you are seeing  this for the first time and you are confused, don't worry! Everything  is all right.  Now that you know what you can find in this package, let's see how to install it   and configure it for the first time.  Installing and configuring the database  package Let's start with the setup. First of all, we will install the package using composer as  usual. After that, we will configure the capsule manager in order to get started.  [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Installing the package Installing the "illuminate database" package is really easy.  All you have to do is to add "illuminate database" to the "require" section   of your composer.json file, like this:  "require": {  },    "illuminate database": "5.0.*",  Then type composer update in to your terminal, and wait for a few seconds.  Another way is to include it with the shortcut in your project folder, obviously   from the terminal:  composer require illuminate database  No matter which method you chose, you just installed the package.  Configuring the package Time to use the capsule manager! In your project, you will use something like   this to get started:  use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;  $capsule = new Capsule;  $capsule->addConnection [   'driver'    => 'mysql',   'host'      => 'localhost',   'database'  => 'database',   'username'  => 'root',   'password'  => 'password',   'charset'   => 'utf8',   'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',   'prefix'    => '', ] ;  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Set the event dispatcher used by Eloquent models...  optional  use Illuminate\Events\Dispatcher; use Illuminate\Container\Container; $capsule->setEventDispatcher new Dispatcher new Container  ;  The config syntax I used is exactly the same you can find in the config database. php configuration file. The only difference is that this time you are explicitly using   an instance of the capsule manager in order to do everything.  In the second part of the code, I am setting up the event dispatcher. You must do   this if events are required from your project.  However, events are not included by default in this package, so you will have to  manually add the "illuminate events" dependency to your composer.json file.  Now, the final step!  Add this code to your setup file:     Make this Capsule instance available globally via static methods...   optional  $capsule->setAsGlobal  ;     Setup the Eloquent ORM...  optional; unless you've used  setEventDispatcher    $capsule->bootEloquent  ;  With setAsGlobal   called on the capsule manager, you can set it as a global  component in order to use it with static methods. You may like it or not; the   choice is yours. The final line starts up Eloquent, so you will need it.  However, this is also an optional instruction. In some situations you may need the  Query Builder only.  Then there is nothing else to do! Your application is now configured with the  database package  and Eloquent !  Using the ORM Using the Eloquent ORM in a non-Laravel application is not a big change. All you  have to do is to declare your model as you are used to doing. Then, you need to call  it and use it as you are used to.  [ 143 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here is a perfect example of what I am talking about:  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Book extends Model {    ...       some attributes here…   protected $table = 'my_books_table';       some scopes here...   public function scopeNewest     {        query here...   }    ...  }  Exactly as you did with Laravel, the package you are using is the same. So, no  worries! If you want to use the model you just created, then use the following:  $books = Book::newest  ->take 5 ->get  ;  This also applies for relationships, observers, and so on. Everything is the same.  In order to use the database package and ORM exactly, you would  do the same thing you did in Laravel; remember to set up the project  structure in a way that follows the PSR-4 autoloading convention.  Using the Query and Schema Builder It's not just about the ORM; with the database package, you can also use the Query  and the Schema Builders. Let's discover how!  [ 144 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Query Builder The Query Builder is also very easy to use. The only difference, this time, is that you  are passing through the capsule manager object, like this:  $books = Capsule::table 'books'               ->where 'title', '=', "Michael Strogoff"               ->first  ;  However, the result is still the same.  Also, if you like the DB facade in Laravel, you can use the capsule manager class in  the same way:  $book = Capsule::select 'select title, pages_count from books   where id = ?', array 12  ;  The Schema Builder At the beginning of this book, I showed you the Schema Builder. You learned how to  use it with migrations, but now, without Laravel, you don't have migrations.  However, you can still use the Schema Builder. Like this:  Capsule::schema  ->create 'books', function $table   {       $table->increments ''id' ;       $table->string ''title'', 30 ;       $table->integer ''pages_count'' ;       $table->decimal ''price'', 5, 2 ;.      $table->text ''description'' ;       $table->timestamps  ;   } ;  Previously, you used to call the create   method of the Schema facade. This time  is a little different: you will use the create   method, chained to the schema    method of the Capsule class.  Obviously, you can use any Schema class method in this way. For instance, you  could call something like following:  Capsule::schema  ->table 'books', function $table   {     $table->string 'title', 50 ->change  ;     $table->decimal 'special_price', 5, 2 ; } ;  [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   And you are good to go!  Remember that if you want to unlock some Schema Builder-specific  features you will need to install other dependencies. For example, do you want to rename a column? You will need the  doctrine dbal dependency package.  Summary Yeah, this time, it was quite quick.  I decided to add this chapter because many people ask me how to use Eloquent  without Laravel. Mostly because they like the framework, but they can't migrate   an already started project in its entirety.  Also, I think that it's cool to know, in a certain sense, what you can find under   the hood.  It is always just about curiosity. Curiosity opens new paths, and you have a choice   to solve a problem in a new and more elegant way.  In these few pages, I just scratched the surface. I want to give you some advice:   explore the code. The best way to write good code is to read good code.  And now, to the final chapter!  [ 146 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It's Not Enough! Extending  Eloquent, Advanced  Concepts  Through this book, you learned that you can do many amazing things with Eloquent.  It is a great active record implementation; it's easy to use, really flexible, and it offers  many tools out of the box to improve your code base quality. A developer usually must face two types of projects: Applications and applications,   as follows:     For applications, I intend something that you can do, maybe in a quick way,  with some workarounds and some hacks, here and there. Also, I know that  you know what I am talking about. That site you made for a friend, a little  blog, and so on.     Let's be clear and serious, you can't make every application with the same,   perfect care. Being honest, neither me nor probably any one does. Then, you  have to deal with Applications. Things can get really serious there, and you  must be able to build a maintainable, awesome application structure.  It's not just about something that works; in this case, I am thinking about   something that can scale easily, with a good quality code base. It's not just about  calling your models from controllers. That's not enough. You could stumble upon  many issues: testability, maintainability, and also in following some principles.  In this chapter, we will explore two different ways to extend Eloquent   more seriously.  [ 147 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In the very first part, you will learn how to extend the Eloquent Model class.  Actually, the Model does many things, but what if we need something more?   No problem: extending the existing Model class will be a bed of roses if standing   on the shoulders of a giant.  Have you ever heard about the Ardent Project? It's a package for Laravel 4 that  extends the Model class, adding some super powers: self-validating models and   auto-hydrating from the request input data.  You'll make something similar for the Laravel 5 Eloquent Model, and I will show you  how to do it step by step. Also, it is inspired by the work of Philip Brown in his blog   http:  culttt.com 2013 08 05 extending-eloquent-in-laravel-4  .  However, as mentioned earlier in this book, Laravel is mostly about freedom,  especially when it comes to freedom in organizing your projects. Now, a really  interesting trend is the repository pattern. It's a way to abstract your code in a better  way and separate responsibilities. For a project bigger than the bakery's blog, it's a  must-have in your knowledge base.  Also, the repository pattern is not something related to Laravel only. This means that  you will learn something new that you will be able to reuse in the future, with other  languages and products.  Alright, no more chitchat. It is time to get our hands dirty for the last time.  Come on, hero! We will cover the following topics:     Extending the Model: Aweloquent !    Diving into the repository pattern    The summary  Extending the Model: Aweloquent! The Eloquent Model can actually do tons of things in a very smart and easy way.  However, something can be improved in terms of code to write every time you   want to do a specific operation.  Usually, when creating a new model instance, you are probably using some data   that the user previously typed in to a form.  Adding a new author to our database can be the perfect example. All you have to do  is to insert the first and last names in to a form and then press save.  [ 148 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Then, in the dedicated post route  or relative controller method , you will do  something similar to the following:  <?php  <?php  public function postAdd Request $request  {   $author = new Author;    $author->first_name = $request->input 'first_name' ;   $author->last_name = $request->input 'last_name' ;    $author->save  ; }  That's quite fine. However, you will probably also have to validate the user input.  So, assuming that you are still in a controller, you could add a controller validator  call, just like this one:  public function postAdd Request $request  {   $this->validate $request, [     'first_name' => 'required',     'last_name' => 'required'   ], [     'first_name.required' => 'You forgot the first name!',     'last_name.required' => 'You forgot the last name!'   ] ;    $author = new Author;    $author->first_name = $request->input 'first_name' ;   $author->last_name = $request->input 'last_name' ;    $author->save  ; }  Once again, saved the day!  [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, very often, developers debate the responsibilities of a single class in terms of  what that class has to do and what not. Everyone has a thought about the topic. The Single Responsibility Principle, a part of the SOLID principles, is very   clear about that—put simply, the principle says that a class should do one and   only one thing.  On the other hand, however, you will often find very big classes. The Eloquent  Model is one of them. At the time of writing, the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\ Model counts 3,399 lines of code. Not exactly something small!  Obviously, the Model doesn't perform a single operation; it fills its own attributes,  deals with relationships, and serializes its own attributes. Yes, it goes far beyond the  principle you just read.  So, what's the deal with it?  Well, even if it is very big, a Model like this allows you to perform many operations  using a single class.  A perfect example is how you can use a Model as a model, like this:  <?php  $user = new User;     using magic methods... $user->first_name = 'Francesco'; $user->last_name = 'Malatesta';  ...  <?php  $user = User::create [   'first_name' => 'Francesco',   'last_name' => 'Malatesta', ] ;  You can also use it as a factory  a class that is used to create instances in a more  elegant and better way  using the create   method:  [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If this isn't enough, the Model also handles everything related to the persistence of  the instance:  <?php  $user = new User;     some assignments... $user->first_name = 'Francesco';    ...     and then save! $user->save  ;  All using a single class—that's the main advantage.  You are probably asking yourself what he is trying to say with all this stuff.   The answer is really simple: there isn't always a single correct solution. Some   people hate the Eloquent Model, some people love it.  So, in this specific situation, I will add new features to the existing Model class  creating a new Eloquent Model… the Aweloquent!  Before we go any further, here's a clarification. I will repeat it again,  but I also want to say it now. In the following part of this chapter,  we will extend the Model class adding a feature that, in Laravel,  is handled by the Validator class. I am not teaching you this  because I want you to do this, but because I want to show you how  to extend the Model class. For instance, you will probably find the smart password hashing  feature stupid, but it's just an example. Extending Models and  using repositories are two different techniques, which are totally  separated. I am just giving you the knowledge, then you can choose  what to do, and I am sure you will do the right thing, hero!  The Aweloquent Model As I mentioned earlier, our powered-up Eloquent Model will be really similar to  the Ardent Laravel 4 package-improved Model. I will also borrow some ideas from  Philip Brown's Magniloquent project.  [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   To be more precise, our improved Model will feature the following:     Auto Hydrate    Model self-validation    Smart password hashing    The autopurge of confirmation fields  Auto Hydrate Instead of assigning attributes individually, or passing them in an array,   the Aweloquent Model will be able to read the current request and autopopulate   its attributes without any other code lines.  This means that you will be able to use the following:  <?php  <?php  $user = new User; $user->save  ;  Instead of the more classic:  $user = new User;  $user->first_name = 'Francesco'; $user->last_name = 'Malatesta';    other assignments here...  $user->save  ;  Model self-validation You will be able to specify validation rules and messages as static properties of a  Model. Then, the Model will automatically perform the validation operation you  need, without using any external classes or controller validators. You will be able,  also, to assign a certain rule to a certain operation  the 'create' or the 'update'  operation, or both .  [ 152 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   So, in your Model, you will have something like this:  <?php namespace App;  use App\Aweloquent\AweloquentModel;  class Author extends AweloquentModel {    protected $fillable = [     'first_name', 'last_name', 'bio'   ];    protected static $rules = [     'everytime' => [       'first_name' => 'required'     ],       'create' => [       'last_name' => 'required'     ],      'update' => [       'bio' => 'required'     ],   ];    protected static $messages = [     'first_name.required' => 'You forgot the first name!',     'last_name.required' => 'You forgot the last name!',     'bio.required' => 'You forgot the biography!'   ];  }  Smart password hashing Another thing you have to do frequently is to hash a password. Usually, you take  the value from a password attribute. So, the Aweloquent Model automatically  performs the hash operation on a password field, if present.  [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The autopurge of confirmation fields The Laravel validator has the confirmed rule, based on an x_confirmation attribute   where x is the name of the field . You have probably used it used it for a password  confirmation field. The auto purge feature of the Aweloquent Model automatically  removes  after validation, of course  every _confirmation field.  However, it's not over yet! The Aweloquent Model will automatically exclude  the '_token' field, used by the Cross Site Request Forgery  CSRF  protection  middleware.  Alright, that's all! Now you can write some code.  Extending the class The first thing you have to do is to create a new class, the AweloquentModel class  that extends the existing Eloquent Model one.  In my specific case, I made something really simple: I created a new folder called  Aweloquent in the app one and then created an AweloquentModel.php file inside.  Here's the code you have to put into this file:  <?php  namespace App\Aweloquent;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class AweloquentModel extends Model {}  Great! As a start, we have our new AweloquentModel class.  If you want, you can use it as a base for your future models. There are no changes  here, just a simple extension.  Let's add the first feature: Auto Hydrate.  The Auto Hydrate feature Before we implement this first feature, let's think about what we want as a result.  [ 154 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Actually, when you create a new model, you can quickly pass its attributes using   the constructor:  <?php  $user = new User [   'first_name' => 'Francesco',   'last_name' => 'Malatesta' ] ;  These parameters are passed from the constructor to another method called fill  :   **    * Create a new Eloquent model instance.    *    * @param  array  $attributes    * @return void    *     public function __construct array $attributes = array      {     $this->bootIfNotBooted  ;      $this->syncOriginal  ;      $this->fill $attributes ;   }  As a logical consequence, if we want to implement this Auto Hydrate feature,   we will have to write a new constructor to deal with the auto hydrating there   and then to call the parent class. So, let's go back to our AweloquentModel class.   Here's the first implementation:  <?php  namespace App\Aweloquent;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class AweloquentModel extends Model {    public function __construct array $attributes = []    {  [ 155 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       $attributes = $this->autoHydrate $attributes ;      parent::__construct $attributes ;   }    private function autoHydrate array $attributes    {        getting the request instance using the service container     $request = app 'Illuminate\Http\Request' ;         getting the request form data, except the token     $requestData = $request->except '_token' ;      foreach $requestData as $name => $value      {          manually specified attribute has priority over auto-         hydrated one.       if !isset $attributes[$name]         $attributes[$name] = $value;     }      return $attributes;   } }  The autoHydrate method creates the following:     An instance of the current request to get the required data    After that, and for each cycle, it adds to the attributes array every   element in the request data array  excluding the CSRF '_token'   Note that the explicit specified attribute  the one you can put in the Model  constructor  has the priority over the request data array. So, you are still free to deal  with the Model and decide what to define and what not, maybe to add some extra  data that you are not getting from the form.  If you try to create a new user by setting up a basic form, the Auto Hydrate feature is  already working.  Let's move forward!  [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The Aweloquent Model self-validation   feature – the basic version It is time to implement the self-validation feature of our Aweloquent Model.   The idea is quite simple: for every model, you will be able to declare  as properties   rules and related messages. So, it should look something like this:  <?php namespace App;  use App\Aweloquent\AweloquentModel;  class Author extends AweloquentModel {    protected $fillable = [     'first_name', 'last_name', 'bio'   ];    protected static $rules = [     'first_name' => 'required',     'last_name' => 'required'   ];    protected static $messages = [     'first_name.required' => 'You forgot the first name!',     'last_name.required' => 'You forgot the last name!'   ];  These rules and message will be used automatically by a validate   dedicated  method. What I want to achieve is something like this:  }  <?php  $user = new User;  if !$user->validate    {   dd $user->errors ; }  [ 157 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   So, let's open the AweloquentModel.php file and add some code:  <?php  namespace App\Aweloquent;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model; use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;  class AweloquentModel extends Model {    protected static $rules = [];   protected static $messages = [];    public $errors;    public function __construct array $attributes = []    {     $attributes = $this->autoHydrate $attributes ;      parent::__construct $attributes ;   }    public function validate     {     $validator = Validator::make $this->attributes,       static::$rules, static::$messages ;      if $validator->fails        {       $this->errors = $validator->messages  ;       return false;     }      return true;   }    private function autoHydrate array $attributes    {        auto hydrate method here...   }  }  [ 158 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Great! The Validator Facadec is used to instantiate a new validator. The static  $rules and $message attributes are used for the make   method.  Then, the $validator->fails   call determines if the given model is valid   or not. If not, the $errors property is populated using the validation errors  MessageBag object.  Obviously, this is a very basic validation system. However, we could   do something more. For instance, an implementation of an operation-based  validation would be great.  Go ahead and try it, if you want! It already works!  The Aweloquent Model self-validation   feature – the operation-based version In order to implement the advanced version of the self-validation system, we have   to define the rule format for every model.  In this specific one, I have chosen something like this:  <?php namespace App;  use App\Aweloquent\AweloquentModel;  class Author extends AweloquentModel {    protected $fillable = [     'first_name', 'last_name', 'bio'   ];    protected static $rules = [     'everytime' => [       'first_name' => 'required'     ],      'create' => [       'last_name' => 'required'     ],      'update' => [  [ 159 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         'bio' => 'required'     ],   ];    protected static $messages = [     'first_name.required' => 'You forgot the first name!',     'last_name.required' => 'You forgot the last name!',     'bio.required' => 'You forgot the biography!'   ];  The $message property is left untouched. The only one that has to be modified is  $rules, as you may easily imagine.  In this new version of $rules, you can define rules for a single operation, 'create',  or both. If you want to use a rule in both of them, there is a dedicated 'everytime'  item to avoid the duplication of rules.  Of course, we have to edit our AweloquentModel once again. This time, we have to  define a method that has to work with the existing validate one and understand if we  are creating or updating it.  Then, merge the right rules in a single array and validate the model against   those rules.  Let's see what we can do! Consider the following code:  }  <?php    ...  class AweloquentModel extends Model {    public function __construct array $attributes = []    {        constructor remains the same…   }    public function validate     {     static::$rules = $this->mergeValidationRules  ;  [ 160 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       $validator = Validator::make $this->attributes, static::$rules,  static::$messages ;      if $validator->fails        {       $this->errors = $validator->messages  ;       return false;     }      return true;   }    private function mergeValidationRules     {        if updating, use "update" rules, "create" otherwise.     if $this->exists        $mergedRules =         array_merge_recursive static::$rules['everytime'],         static::$rules       ['update'] ;   else     $mergedRules =       array_merge_recursive static::$rules['everytime'],       static::$rules      ['create'] ;    $finalRules = [];    foreach $mergedRules as $field => $rules {     if is_array $rules         $finalRules[$field] = implode "", $rules ;     else       $finalRules[$field] = $rules;     }      return $finalRules;   }  }  Great, we have it!  [ 161 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The validate   method doesn't change too much. The only big difference stands in  the newly line:  static::$rules = $this->mergeValidationRules  ;  Basically, we are saying, "Ok, now assign to the $rules property the result of this  mergeValidationRules   method."  Then, in the mergeValidationRules   method, the first instruction to be used is:  if $this->exists   That is used to determine if the current operation is an insert or an update.   Starting from this value, we can get the right rules array, merging them with the  everytime rules.  Your new complex self-validating model is almost ready to be used.  Smart password hashing and the confirmation  fields autopurge method The last features we have to implement are the smart password hashing and  confirmation fields auto purge methods.  The first is very easy and intuitive:  private function smartPasswordHashing   {   if $this->attributes['password']      $this->attributes['password'] = Hash::make $this-       >attributes['password'] ; }  If a 'password' field is present, hash it. Nothing more!  Even if, it's a little longer, the purgeConfirmationFields   isn't so hard to  understand:  private function purgeConfirmationFields   {   foreach $this->attributes as $name => $value    {     if Str::endsWith $name, '_confirmation'         unset $this->attributes[$name] ;   } }  [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This time, I used the Str string utility class in order to use the endsWith   method,  which is used to determine if a strings ends with a certain sequence of characters.  Every '_confirmation' field is removed.  Fixing the save   Model method Now, the last thing that we need to fix is the save   method. Actually, the save    method totally ignores the validation procedure, and this is no good. So, this is my  final version of the AweloquentModel class:  <?php  namespace App\Aweloquent;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model; use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash; use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator; use Illuminate\Support\Str;  class AweloquentModel extends Model {    protected static $rules = [];   protected static $messages = [];    public $errors;    public function __construct array $attributes = []    {     $attributes = $this->autoHydrate $attributes ;      parent::__construct $attributes ;   }    public function save array $options = []    {     if $this->validate        {       $this->smartPasswordHashing  ;       $this->purgeConfirmationFields  ;        return parent::save $options ;     }  [ 163 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       else       return false;   }    public function validate     {     static::$rules = $this->mergeValidationRules  ;      $validator = Validator::make $this->attributes,       static::$rules, static::$messages ;      if $validator->fails        {       $this->errors = $validator->messages  ;       return false;     }      return true;   }    private function autoHydrate array $attributes    {        getting the request instance using the service container     $request = app 'Illuminate\Http\Request' ;         getting the request form data, except the token     $requestData = $request->except '_token' ;      foreach $requestData as $name => $value      {          manually specified attribute has priority over auto-         hydrated one.       if !isset $attributes[$name]           $attributes[$name] = $value;     }      return $attributes;   }    private function mergeValidationRules     {  [ 164 ]  www.it-ebooks.info          if updating, use "update" rules, "create" otherwise.     if $this->exists        $mergedRules =         array_merge_recursive static::$rules['everytime'],         static::$rules        ['update'] ;     else       $mergedRules =         array_merge_recursive static::$rules['everytime'],         static::$rules      ['create'] ;      $finalRules = [];      foreach $mergedRules as $field => $rules {       if is_array $rules           $finalRules[$field] = implode "", $rules ;       else         $finalRules[$field] = $rules;     }      return $finalRules;   }    private function smartPasswordHashing     {     if $this->attributes['password']        $this->attributes['password'] = Hash::make $this-         >attributes['password'] ;   }    private function purgeConfirmationFields     {     foreach $this->attributes as $name => $value      {       if Str::endsWith $name, '_confirmation'           unset $this->attributes[$name] ;     }   } }  [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's analyze the save   method in detail:  public function save array $options = []  {   if $this->validate      {     $this->smartPasswordHashing  ;     $this->purgeConfirmationFields  ;      return parent::save $options ;   }   else     return false; }  The first thing to do is to validate the entire input. After that, if everything is   fine, passwords are hashed and the confirmation fields are purged, as we don't   need them anymore.  Finally, the parent::save   method is called, and the operation is complete.  In order to create a perfect continuity with the parent class,   I declared the save   method with the same signature as its  parent  including the $options array parameter .  That's it! The AweloquentModel class is finished, and you can use it as you want in  your projects. You also learned how to go deep inside the Model class and extend it  in order to add new methods, behaviors, and features.  Diving into the repository pattern If you know a couple of things about good development and best practices,   you have probably heard about software design patterns.  You can define them as useful solution templates for a certain kind of problem,   or to be more precise:  "In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to   a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.   A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into  source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem  that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are formalized best practices  that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an  application or system."  [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This extract is from the software design patterns page    http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Software_design_pattern   on Wikipedia.  Now, let's focus on the second sentence.  A design pattern is not something that can be transformed directly into source code.  That's the most important part because it explains many things. It is not something  you learn specifically for Laravel or maybe for a certain language.  Absolutely, once you learned about design patterns, it is for life!  In the previous part of this chapter, you learned how to create an improved version  of the Eloquent Model. You reached the objective by adding something to the  existing model.  However, many people don't like that kind of approach. They strongly believe in  the Single Responsibility Principle, so every class must do one and only one thing.  Nothing more!  Let's be clear; I don't want to bore you by adding my useless opinion in this   long-time debate.  In the final part of this chapter, I will introduce a specific design pattern that can   be really useful for improving a Laravel application—the repository pattern.  Hello, repository pattern! You know that I like to explain a concepts with an example as a start.   This is no exception.  Imagine that you are building an application for a warehouse. In this warehouse,   you can store whatever you want and you probably have a model like this:  <?php namespace Warehouse;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Item extends Model {       properties and methods here...  }  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You are probably using this model in a controller, like this one: <?php namespace Warehouse\Http\Controllers;  class ItemsController extends Controller {    public function getIndex     {     $items = \Warehouse\Item::orderBy 'created_at', 'DESC' -       >paginate 30 ;      return view 'item.list', compact 'items'  ;   }  }  There's nothing to say; it works, and you know it.  This is a cool solution for a simple project, the kind of project that you can call an  application. However, what happens if we don't have an Application, instead?  Imagine that the business you're helping grows and the management decides to  create a mobile application that must be used internally. You will probably need to  implement an API for the other developers.  If you don't know how to deal with something like this, you will soon start to write  duplicated code. In your Rest API, for sure, there will be an endpoint \items that  does the same thing you did in the controller method such as:  $items = \Warehouse\Item::orderBy 'created_at', 'DESC' ->paginate 30 ;  Repeating the same code many times isn't safe. You know it, right? But no fear, hero! The solution is called a repository pattern. The best definition of this concept is the one you can find on Martin Fowler's website   http:  martinfowler.com eaaCatalog repository.html :  "A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting  like an in-memory domain object collection. Client objects construct query  specifications declaratively and submit them to Repository for satisfaction.  Objects can be added to and removed from the Repository, as they can from a  simple collection of objects, and the mapping code encapsulated by the Repository  will carry out the appropriate operations behind the scenes."  [ 168 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   So, imagine a repository as something in between that abstracts all the necessary.  Going back to the previous example, imagine that we have a repository with a  dedicated method getRecent $perPage, $pageNumber .  We will use the same method in the controller:   <?php namespace Warehouse\Http\Controllers;  class ItemsController extends Controller {    public function getIndex ItemsRepository $itemsRepository    {        this is an example...     $items = $itemsRepository->getRecent 30, 1 ;       return view 'item.list', compact 'items'  ;   }  In the Rest API, the following method is used:  Route::get 'api v1 items', function ItemsRepository $repo {    return $repo->getRecent 30, 1 ;  }  <?php  } ;  The same code is used twice and written once. However, there's more than this;   let's see how to implement repositories in a Laravel project.  Introducing repositories – a concrete  implementation The best way to start with repositories is to implement a concrete implementation.  As I mentioned earlier, a repository stands between the controller and model. It is  something in the middle.  When you build a repository, you must do it thinking about what you will need from  the repository. Let's imagine something for our Author model.  [ 169 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   I will probably need the following methods:     getAll $perPage, $pageNumber : This returns a paginated list of every   author in my data source     find $authorId : This returns a specific author with a certain primary key    search $firstName, $lastName : This returns an array of results starting   from the first name to the last name  Enough of searching for and getting records! However, we will also need other  methods, which are dedicated to data persistence:     create $authorData : This will save a new author in the data source    save $authorData, $authorId : This will update an existing author in the   data source with a certain primary key  First of all, create a new directory in the app folder. Name it Repositories. Inside it,  create a new file called DbAuthorsRepository.php.  Let's start!  Here's the content:  <?php  namespace App\Repositories;  use App\Author;  class DbAuthorsRepository {    private $model;    public function __construct Author $model    {     $this->model = $model;   }    public function getAll $perPage, $pageNumber    {     $authors = $this->model->skip  $pageNumber - 1  * $perPage -       >take $perPage ->get  ;     return $authors->toArray  ;   }  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     public function find $authorId    {     return $this->model->find $authorId ->toArray  ;   }    public function search $firstName, $lastName    {     return $this->model     ->where 'first_name', 'LIKE', '%'.$firstName.'%'      ->where 'last_name', 'LIKE', '%'.$lastName.'%'      ->get       ->toArray  ;   }    public function create $authorData    {     return $this->model->create $authorData ;   }  }  <?php  } ;    public function update $authorData, $authorId    {     return $this->model->find $authorId ->update $authorData ;   }  This is how you can use it in some test routes:  Route::get 'authors',   function \App\Repositories\DbAuthorsRepository $repository {    return $repository->getAll 10, 1 ;  Route::get 'create_author',   function \App\Repositories\DbAuthorsRepository $repository {    $repository->create [     'first_name' => 'Francesco',     'last_name' => 'Malatesta',  [ 171 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Route::get 'update_author',   function \App\Repositories\DbAuthorsRepository $repository {      'bio' => 'Lorem ipsum...'   ] ;  } ;    $repository->update [     'first_name' => 'Frank',     'last_name' => 'Smith',     'bio' => 'Other ipsum...'   ], 6 ;  } ;  Nothing more!  By creating a repository, you learned how to improve your software architecture and  the abstraction level of your solution. Also, instead of what you saw earlier in this  chapter with Aweloquent, this time you can feel a great separation of responsibilities.  However, this is not the end yet; the repository pattern hasn't yet shown all   of its power.  Coding on Abstractions I already introduced you to the SOLID principles earlier in this chapter.   I mentioned the Single Responsibility Principle, the S of SOLID. Now that we   are close to the end, I will introduce the D.  The dependency inversion principle is one of my favorites because it really  highlights the importance of abstracting your code base the best you can.  Its definition is:  "A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should  depend on abstractions.  B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on  abstractions."  -Wikipedia  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Dependency_inversion_ principle   [ 172 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In a few words, the concept is that you must code abstractions and should not  depend on concrete classes. Else, a better way to say it: you must depend on  abstractions and not on concrete classes.  In PHP, talking about abstraction refers to working with interfaces and contracts.  In a certain sense, Laravel itself widely uses this concept. The basic Laravel   package is Contracts, that is made up of several interfaces that specify what   every component must do and how it does it.  However, it's not just about a framework big thing. You can apply this principle  in your everyday development. More specifically, you can apply the concept to  repositories.  I will show you how!  Repositories – a complete implementation Before we dive in, let's introduce a little problem to our software.  Actually, our situation is the following: our controllers and routes use the  DbAuthorsRepository class to get data, like this:  Route::get 'authors', function \App\Repositories\DbAuthorsRepository  $repository {    return $repository->getAll 10, 1 ;  Then, the DbAuthorsRepository class uses the Author model in order to get the  desired data from the physical storage:  } ;  <?php  namespace App\Repositories;  use App\Author;  class DbAuthorsRepository {    private $model;  [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     public function __construct Author $model    {     $this->model = $model;   }    public function getAll $perPage, $pageNumber    {     $authors = $this->model->skip  $pageNumber - 1  * $perPage -       >take $perPage ->get  ;     return $authors->toArray  ;   }  }  Now, let's imagine that our data sources change. For a certain reason  I know,   that is quite paradoxical , the management wants to switch to a file-based storage.  You have two ways to deal with this problem:     You scream and are paralyzed by fear    Decide to organize your code base in a better way, introducing interfaces    in to your repository workflow  Here's the plan:  Using the Laravel service container, you can decide to bind a certain interface to a  specific implementation.  So, if you create an interface for every repository, you will be able to write your code  once and then write every concrete repository you need and, finally, to switch from  one repository to another, you will have to change a single line of code.  However, let's make it step by step:  1.  First of all, let's define a standard behavior for our author's repository   defining an AuthorRepository interface. Create a new AuthorRepository. php file in app Repositories Contracts. I will use the Contracts folder  for interfaces. Here're the contents of the fresh file: <?php  namespace App\Repositories\Contracts;  [ 174 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   interface AuthorsRepository {    public function getAll $perPage, $pageNumber ;    public function find $authorId ;    public function search $firstName, $lastName ;    public function create $authorData ;    public function update $authorData, $authorId ;  }  Interfaces are pure abstraction. All we are saying here is, "When I build a  new author repository, I don't care about the underlying implementation. I  don't care if I am working with a NoSQL database or a flat file driver. All I  want is that every repository implements all these methods." Working in this manner means that we can define a standard format for  every component  or repository, in this case  that we will use in the future.  2.  Now we can update our DbAuthorsRepository class in order to implement   our interface. Consider the following line: class DbAuthorsRepository { It now becomes: class DbAuthorsRepository implements AuthorsRepository {  Ok. Now, let's see the power of the entire mechanism in action.  3.  First of all, open the app Providers AppServiceProvider.php file and add   this binding to the register   method: public function register   {   $this->app->bind      'App\Repositories\Contracts\AuthorsRepository',     'App\Repositories\DbAuthorsRepository'    ; }  Laravel now knows that every time you will request an instance  of AuthorsRepository, it will have to create an instance of the  DbAuthorsRepository using the service container.  [ 175 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   4.  To test our assumptions, open the routes file and add this:  Route::get 'authors', function \App\Repositories\Contracts\ AuthorsRepository $repository {      return $repository->getAll 10, 1 ;  The result will be exactly what we are expecting. Also, using the method  injection technique, we don't have to explicitly call the service container. In fact, an alternative to this syntax would be the following:  5.   Route::get 'authors', function  {      $repository = app 'App\Repositories\Contracts\ AuthorsRepository' ;      return $repository->getAll 10, 1 ;  <?php  } ;  } ;  Adding the new repository Finally, we are close to the end. Let's return to our main problem: we have to  implement a new file-based author's repository.  At this point, it is quite easy:  1.  First, create a new file in app Repositories, called   2.   FileAuthorsRepository. It will be a new class, of course. It will implement the AuthorsRepository interface, obviously. Here are the class contents: <?php  namespace App\Repositories;  use App\Repositories\Contracts\AuthorsRepository;  class FileAuthorsRepository implements AuthorsRepository {  [ 176 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     public function getAll $perPage, $pageNumber    {     dd 'getting all records from flat file driver...' ;   }    public function find $authorId    {     dd 'searching by id: ' . $authorId ;   }    public function search $firstName, $lastName    {     dd 'searching by first and last name...', $firstName,       $lastName ;   }    public function create $authorData    {     dd 'creating new author ', $authorData ;   }    public function update $authorData, $authorId    {     dd 'updating author ' . $authorId, $authorData ;   }  }  3.   As you can easily see, I have implemented all the required methods   from the interface. This means that our application will be able to use   the FileAuthorsRepository in the same way as the DbAuthorsRepository. I filled method bodies with some dd instructions, just to show you how the  concept works. For our final step, go to the AppServiceProvider class and  update the previous binding to the following: public function register   {   $this->app->bind      'App\Repositories\Contracts\AuthorsRepository',     'App\Repositories\FileAuthorsRepository'    ; }  4.  Now, browse to the  authors route. Yes, the output now is:  "getting all records from flat file driver..."  [ 177 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Yes, it worked!  Our route file will never know what repository it is using: the interface defines   all the methods you need.  This is fantastic because, for instance, if you want to add a NoSQL repository  to your application in the future, all you will have to do is to create a new  NoSQLAuthorsRepository class that implements the AuthorsRepository   interface. Then, in the AppServiceProvider, you will switch the binding   with the one you need.  Easy, cool, and also testable!  Maybe I am a little repetitive, but focus your attention on this specific point: with the  mentioned structure, you can abstract the way you work with your data from the  way you access to it. I know that reading the same thing again and again is boring,  but I need you to understand this concept. It is probable that the first time you read about repositories you will think what   am I doing here? What the hell? I have done the same thing, so I totally understand  your doubts. However, when you work on a more complex project, you will totally  feel the difference.  That's the magic of repositories!  Summary We are done. In this final chapter, you learned about empowering your application  in two different and separate ways: on one hand, adding features on an existing  entity. In this case, the Eloquent Model.  On the other one, you learned how to structure your application in a different way  using repositories in order to get a better code testability, maintainability, and a  separation of purposes instead of delegating everything to a single class.  Now you have all the tools you need to build great applications using Eloquent   and Laravel.  What are you waiting for? Go on and make me proud!

Learning Laravel's Eloquent starts off by taking you through setting up your first project and guiding you in creating a perfect Laravel environment. You will learn how to build the right database structure with the Migrations system and the Schema Builder class. Next, you will be introduced to the main element of Eloquent: the model. After treating the model as a single, isolated entity, you will learn how to create relations between them. You will be taken through organizing, filtering, and sorting your data with collections. You will then learn to enhance an application with new features using events and by creating new observers. Towards the end of the book, you will discover how to install, configure, and use the Eloquent ORM without Laravel. The book concludes by walking you through how to deal with complex problems and build advanced and flexible systems
